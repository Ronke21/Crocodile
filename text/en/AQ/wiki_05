<text>Russian literature refers to the literature of Russia, its émigrés, and to Russian-language literature. Major contributors to Russian literature, as well as English for instance, are authors of different ethnic origins, including bilingual writers, such as Kyrgyz novelist Chinghiz Aitmatov. At the same time, Russian-language literature does not include works by authors from the Russian Federation who write exclusively or primarily in the native languages of the indigenous non-Russian ethnic groups in Russia, thus the famous Dagestani poet Rasul Gamzatov is omitted. 

The roots of Russian literature can be traced to the Early Middle Ages when Old Church Slavonic was introduced as a liturgical language and became used as a literary language. The native Russian vernacular remained the use within oral literature as well as written for decrees, laws, messages, chronicles, military tales, and so on. By the Age of Enlightenment, literature had grown in importance, and from the early 1830s, Russian literature underwent an astounding &quot;Golden Age&quot; in poetry, prose and drama. The Romantic movement contributed to a flowering of literary talent: poet Vasily Zhukovsky and later his protégé Alexander Pushkin came to the fore. Mikhail Lermontov was one of the most important poets and novelists. Nikolai Gogol and Ivan Turgenev wrote masterful short stories and novels. Fyodor Dostoevsky and Leo Tolstoy became internationally renowned. Other important figures were Ivan Goncharov, Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin and Nikolai Leskov. In the second half of the century Anton Chekhov excelled in short stories and became a leading dramatist. The end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century is sometimes called the Silver Age of Russian poetry. The poets most often associated with the &quot;Silver Age&quot; are Konstantin Balmont, Valery Bryusov, Alexander Blok, Anna Akhmatova, Nikolay Gumilyov, Sergei Yesenin, Vladimir Mayakovsky, and Marina Tsvetaeva. This era produced novelists and short-story writers, such as Aleksandr Kuprin, Nobel Prize winner Ivan Bunin, Leonid Andreyev, Fyodor Sologub, Yevgeny Zamyatin, Alexander Belyaev, Andrei Bely and Maxim Gorky.

After the Russian Revolution of 1917, literature split into Soviet and white émigré parts. While the Soviet Union assured universal literacy and a highly developed book printing industry, it also established ideological censorship. In the 1930s Socialist realism became the predominant trend in Russia. Its leading figures were Nikolay Ostrovsky, Alexander Fadeyev and other writers, who laid the foundations of this style. Ostrovsky&#x27;s novel &quot;How the Steel Was Tempered&quot; has been among the most popular works of Russian Socrealist literature. Some writers, such as Mikhail Bulgakov, Andrei Platonov and Daniil Kharms were criticized and wrote with little or no hope of being published. Various &quot;émigré&quot; writers, such as poets Vladislav Khodasevich, Georgy Ivanov and Vyacheslav Ivanov; novelists such as Ivan Shmelyov, Gaito Gazdanov, Vladimir Nabokov and Bunin, continued to write in exile. Some writers dared to oppose Soviet ideology, like Nobel Prize-winning novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Varlam Shalamov, who wrote about life in the gulag camps. The Khrushchev Thaw brought some fresh wind to literature and poetry became a mass cultural phenomenon. This &quot;thaw&quot; did not last long; in the 1970s, some of the most prominent authors were banned from publishing and prosecuted for their anti-Soviet sentiments.

The post-Soviet end of the 20th century was a difficult period for Russian literature, with few distinct voices. Among the most discussed authors of this period were novelists Victor Pelevin and Vladimir Sorokin, and the poet Dmitri Prigov. In the 21st century, a new generation of Russian authors appeared, differing greatly from the postmodernist Russian prose of the late 20th century, which led critics to speak about &quot;new realism&quot;.

Russian authors have significantly contributed to numerous literary genres. Russia has five Nobel Prize in Literature laureates. As of 2011, Russia was the fourth largest book producer in the world in terms of published titles. A popular folk saying claims Russians are &quot;the world&#x27;s most reading nation&quot;. As the American scholar Gary Saul Morson notes, &quot;No country has ever valued literature more than Russia.&quot;

==Medieval and early modern era==
Scholars typically use the term &quot;Old Russian literature&quot;, in addition to the terms &quot;medieval Russian literature&quot; and &quot;early modern Russian literature&quot;, or &quot;pre-Petrian literature&quot;, to refer to Russian literature until the reforms of Peter the Great, tying literary development to historical periodization. The term is generally used to refer to all forms of literary activity in what is often called &quot;Old Russia&quot; from the 11th to 17th centuries.

Literary works from this period were often written in the Russian recension of Church Slavonic with varying amounts of the Russian or more broadly East Slavic vernacular. At the same time, the native Old Russian vernacular was not only language of oral literature, such as epic poems (&quot;bylina&quot;) or folksongs, but it was also perfectly legitimate as written for practical purposes, such as decrees, laws (the &quot;Russkaya Pravda&quot;, the 11th–12th century, and other codes), letters (for example, the unique pre-paper birch bark manuscripts, the 11th–15th centuries, in the Old Novgorod dialect), ambassadorial messages, &quot;in chronicles or military tales whose language is fundamentally the Russian vernacular.&quot;

Old Russian &quot;bookish&quot; literature traces its beginnings to the introduction of Old Church Slavonic in Kievan Rus&#x27; as a liturgical language in the late 10th century following Christianization. The East Slavs soon developed their own literature, and the oldest dated manuscript of Early Russian as well all-Slavic literature that has survived to this day is the Novgorod Codex or Novgorod Psalter written c. 1000, unearthed in 2000 at Veliky Novgorod, containing four wooden tablet pages filled with wax. Another earliest Russian book is the Ostromir Gospels written in 1056–1057, which belongs to the set of liturgical texts that were translated from other languages.

The main type of Old Russian historical literature were chronicles, most of them anonymous. The oldest one is the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; or &quot;Tale&quot; of Nestor the Chronicler (c. 1115). The oldest surviving manuscripts include the Laurentian Codex of 1377 and the Hypatian Codex dating to the 1420s. Anonymous works include &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot; (a 12th century prose poem masterpiece) and &quot;Praying of Daniel the Immured&quot;. Hagiographies () formed a popular literary genre in Old Russian literature. The first notable hagiographer was Nestor the Chronicler, who wrote about the lives of Boris and Gleb, the first saints of Kievan Rus&#x27;, and the abbot Theodosius. The &quot;Life of Alexander Nevsky&quot; is a well-known example, which combines political realism and hagiographical ideals, and concentrates on the key events of Alexander Nevsky&#x27;s political career. The earliest account of a pilgrimage is &quot;The Pilgrimage of the Abbot Daniel&quot;, which records the journey of Daniel the Traveller to the Holy Land. Complex epic works such as &quot;The Tale of the Destruction of Ryazan&quot; recall the havoc caused by the Mongol invasions. Other notable Russian literary works include &quot;Zadonschina&quot;, &quot;Physiologist&quot;, &quot;Synopsis&quot; and &quot;A Journey Beyond the Three Seas&quot;. Medieval Russian literature had an overwhelmingly religious character and used an adapted form of the Church Slavonic language with many South Slavic elements.

In the 16th century, reflecting the political centralization and unification of the country under the tsar, chronicles were updated and codified, the Russian Orthodox Church began issuing its decrees in the &quot;Stoglav&quot;, and a large compilation called the &quot;Great Menaion Reader&quot; collected both the more modern polemical texts and the hagiographical and patristic legacy of Old Russia. The &quot;Book of Royal Degrees&quot; codified the cult of the tsar, the &quot;Domostroy&quot; laid down the rules for family life, and other texts such as the &quot;History of Kazan&quot; were used to justify the actions of the tsar. &quot;The Tale of Peter and Fevronia&quot; were among the original tales of this period, and Russian tsar Ivan IV wrote some of most original works of 16th-century Russian literature. The Time of Troubles marked a turning point in Old Russian literature as both the church and state lost control over the written word, which are reflected in the texts of writers such as Avraamy Palitsyn who developed a literary technique for representing complex characters.

In the second half of the 17th century, the literature of Baroque took shape, primarily due to the initiative of tsar Alexis of Russia, who wanted to open a court theatre in 1672. Its director and playwright was Johann Gottfried Gregorii, a German-Russian pastor, who wrote, in particular, the 10-hour play &quot;The Action of Artaxerxes&quot;. The poetry and dramaturgy of Symeon of Polotsk and Demetrius of Rostov contributed to the development of the Russian version of the Baroque.

In the 17th century, when bookmen from the Kiev Academy arrived in Moscow, they brought with them a
culture heavily influenced by the educational system of the Polish Jesuits. Mentioned Symeon of Polotsk created a new style which fused elements of ancient and contemporary Western European literature with traditional Russian rhetoric and the imperial ideology, which marked a key step in the Westernization of Russian literature. Syllabic poetry was also brought to Russia, and the work of Simeon of Polotsk was continued by Sylvester Medvedev and Karion Istomin.

&quot;The Life of the Archpriest Avvakum&quot;—an outstanding novelty autobiography written by the one of leaders of the 17th-century religious dissidents Old Believers Avvakum—is considered masterpiece of pre-Petrian literature, which blends high Old Church Slavonic with low Russian vernacular and profanity without following literary canons.

==Age of Enlightenment, 18th century==

After taking the throne at the end of the 17th century, Peter the Great&#x27;s influence on the Russian culture would extend far into the 18th century. Peter&#x27;s reign during the beginning of the 18th century initiated a series of modernizing changes in Russian literature. The reforms he implemented encouraged Russian artists and scientists to make innovations in their crafts and fields with the intention of creating an economy and culture comparable. Peter&#x27;s example set a precedent for the remainder of the 18th century as Russian writers began to form clear ideas about the proper use and progression of the Russian language. Through their debates regarding versification of the Russian language and tone of Russian literature, the writers in the first half of the 18th century were able to lay foundation for the more poignant, topical work of the late 18th century. 

Satirist Antiokh Dmitrievich Kantemir, 1708–1744, was one of the earliest Russian writers not only to praise the ideals of Peter I&#x27;s reforms but the ideals of the growing Enlightenment movement in Europe. Kantemir&#x27;s works regularly expressed his admiration for Peter, most notably in his epic dedicated to the emperor entitled &quot;Petrida&quot;. More often, however, Kantemir indirectly praised Peter&#x27;s influence through his satiric criticism of Russia&#x27;s &quot;superficiality and obscurantism&quot;, which he saw as manifestations of the backwardness Peter attempted to correct through his reforms. Kantemir honored this tradition of reform not only through his support for Peter, but by initiating a decade-long debate on the proper syllabic versification using the Russian language.

Vasily Kirillovich Trediakovsky, a poet, playwright, essayist, translator and contemporary to Antiokh Kantemir, also found himself deeply entrenched in Enlightenment conventions in his work with the Russian Academy of Sciences and his groundbreaking translations of French and classical works to the Russian language. A turning point in the course of Russian literature, his translation of Paul Tallemant&#x27;s work &quot;Voyage to the Isle of Love&quot;, was the first to use the Russian vernacular as opposed the formal and outdated Church-Slavonic. This introduction set a precedent for secular works to be composed in the vernacular, while sacred texts would remain in Church-Slavonic. However, his work was often incredibly theoretical and scholarly, focused on promoting the versification of the language with which he spoke.

While Trediakovsky&#x27;s approach to writing is often described as highly erudite, the young writer and scholarly rival to Trediakovsky, Alexander Petrovich Sumarokov, 1717–1777, was dedicated to the styles of French classicism. Sumarokov&#x27;s interest in the form of the 17th-century French literature mirrored his devotion to the westernizing spirit of Peter the Great&#x27;s age. Although he often disagreed with Trediakovsky, Sumarokov also advocated the use of simple, natural language in order to diversify the audience and make more efficient use of the Russian language. Like his colleagues and counterparts, Sumarokov extolled the legacy of Peter I, writing in his manifesto &quot;Epistle on Poetry&quot;, &quot;The great Peter hurls his thunder from the Baltic shores, the Russian sword glitters in all corners of the universe&quot;. Peter the Great&#x27;s policies of westernization and displays of military prowess naturally attracted Sumarokov and his contemporaries.

Mikhail Vasilyevich Lomonosov, in particular, expressed his gratitude for and dedication to Peter&#x27;s legacy in his unfinished &quot;Peter the Great&quot;, Lomonosov&#x27;s works often focused on themes of the awe-inspiring, grandeur nature, and was therefore drawn to Peter because of the magnitude of his military, architectural and cultural feats. In contrast to Sumarokov&#x27;s devotion to simplicity, Lomonosov favored a belief in a hierarchy of literary styles divided into high, middle and low. This style facilitated Lomonosov&#x27;s grandiose, high minded writing and use of both vernacular and Church-Slavonic. 

The influence of Peter I and debates over the function and form of literature as it related to the Russian language in the first half of the 18th century set a stylistic precedent for the writers during the reign of Catherine the Great in the second half of the century. However, the themes and scopes of the works these writers produced were often more poignant, political and controversial. Ippolit Bogdanovich&#x27;s narrative poem &quot;Dushenka&quot; (1778) is rare sample of the Rococo style, erotic light poetry in Russia. Alexander Nikolayevich Radishchev, for example, shocked the Russian public with his depictions of the socio-economic condition of the serfs. Empress Catherine II condemned this portrayal, forcing Radishchev into exile in Siberia.

Others, however, picked topics less offensive to the autocrat. the historian and writer Nikolay Karamzin, 1766–1826, the key figure of literary sentimentalism in Russia, for example, is known for his advocacy of Russian writers adopting traits in the poetry and prose like a heightened sense of emotion and physical vanity, considered to be feminine at the time as well as supporting the cause of female Russian writers. Karamzin&#x27;s call for male writers to write with femininity was not in accordance with the Enlightenment ideals of reason and theory, considered masculine attributes. His works were thus not universally well received; however, they did reflect in some areas of society a growing respect for, or at least ambivalence toward, a female ruler in Catherine the Great. This concept heralded an era of regarding female characteristics in writing as an abstract concept linked with attributes of frivolity, vanity and pathos.

Some writers, on the other hand, were more direct in their praise for Catherine II. Gavrila Romanovich Derzhavin, famous for his odes, often dedicated his poems to Empress Catherine II. In contrast to most of his contemporaries, Derzhavin was highly devoted to his state; he served in the military, before rising to various roles in Catherine II&#x27;s government, including secretary to the Empress and Minister of Justice. Unlike those who took after the grand style of Mikhail Lomonosov and Alexander Sumarokov, Derzhavin was concerned with the minute details of his subjects.

Denis Fonvizin, an author primarily of comedy, approached the subject of the Russian nobility with an angle of critique. Fonvizin felt the nobility should be held to the standards they were under the reign of Peter the Great, during which the quality of devotion to the state was rewarded. His works criticized the current system for rewarding the nobility without holding them responsible for the duties they once performed. Using satire and comedy, Fonvizin supported a system of nobility in which the elite were rewarded based upon personal merit rather than the hierarchal favoritism that was rampant during Catherine the Great&#x27;s reign.

==Golden Age==


The 19th century is traditionally referred to as the &quot;Golden Era&quot; of Russian literature. 
The period of Romantic literature saw the flowering of poetic talent, in particular; the names of Vasily Zhukovsky and his protégé Alexander Pushkin came to the fore. Pushkin is credited with crystallizing the literary Russian language and introducing a new level of artistry to Russian literature. His best-known work is a pre-realistic novel in verse, &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; (1833). Other poets important to the movement include Konstantin Batyushkov, Pyotr Vyazemsky, Yevgeny Baratynsky, Fyodor Tyutchev and Dmitry Venevitinov, along with the novelists Antony Pogorelsky, Alexander Bestuzhev and &quot;Russian Hoffmann&quot; Vladimir Odoyevsky. Tyutchev is best known for the following verse:
An entire new generation of Romantic poets and novelists followed in Pushkin&#x27;s steps. Mikhail Lermontov wrote the narrative poem &quot;Demon&quot; in 1829–39, which chronicled the love of a Byronic Demon for a mortal woman, as well as &quot;A Hero of Our Time&quot; (1841), which is often considered to be the first Russian psychological novel. Aleksey K. Tolstoy and Afanasy Fet were also significant. 

As Romanticism came to command the stage, realistic began to flourish as well. The first great Russian novel was &quot;Dead Souls&quot; (1842) by Nikolai Gogol. The realistic natural school of fiction is said to have begun with the works of Ivan Goncharov, mainly remembered for his novel &quot;Oblomov&quot; (1859), as well as Ivan Turgenev. Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Leo Tolstoy soon became internationally renowned, to the point that scholars, such as F. R. Leavis, have frequently described them as among the greatest novelists of all time. Tolstoy&#x27;s Christian anarchism can be seen in the following quote:

Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin is known for his satirical chronicle &quot;The History of a Town&quot; (1870) and the family saga &quot;The Golovlyov Family&quot; (1880), which are considered his masterpieces. Nikolai Leskov is best remembered for his shorter fiction and for his (together with Pavel Melnikov) unique &quot;skaz&quot; techniques, namely oral form of narrative stylization. Late in the century Anton Chekhov emerged as a master of the short story as well as a leading international dramatist.

Other important 19th-century developments included Sergey Aksakov&#x27;s semi-autobiographical writings; the father of Russian social realism poetry school, known for the sharp epic poem &quot;Who Can Be Happy and Free in Russia?&quot; Nikolay Nekrasov; the fabulist Ivan Krylov; the precursor to Naturalism Aleksey Pisemsky; non-fiction writers such as the critic Vissarion Belinsky and the political reformer Alexander Herzen; playwrights such as Aleksandr Griboyedov, Aleksandr Ostrovsky, Alexander Sukhovo-Kobylin and the satirist Kozma Prutkov (a collective pen name).

==Silver Age==

The 1890s and the beginning of the 20th century ranks as the Silver Age of Russian poetry. Well-known poets of the period include: Alexander Blok, Sergei Yesenin, Valery Bryusov, Konstantin Balmont, Mikhail Kuzmin, Igor Severyanin, Sasha Chorny, Nikolay Gumilyov, Maximilian Voloshin, Innokenty Annensky, Zinaida Gippius. The poets most often associated with the &quot;Silver Age&quot; are Anna Akhmatova, Marina Tsvetaeva, Osip Mandelstam, and Boris Pasternak.

The Russian symbolism was the first Silver Age development in the 1890s. It arose enough separately from West European symbolism, emphasizing mysticism of Sophiology and defamiliarization. Its most significant figures included philosopher and poet Vladimir Solovyov (1853–1900), poets and writers Valery Bryusov (1873–1924), Fyodor Sologub (1863–1927), Vyacheslav Ivanov (1866–1949), Konstantin Balmont (1867–1942), and figures of the new wave generation Alexander Blok (1880–1921) with Andrei Bely (1880–1934).

&quot;New peasant poets&quot; was the conditional collective name of a group of peasant origin and country poetry trend (Nikolai Klyuev, Pyotr Oreshin, Alexander Shiryaevets, Sergei Klychkov, Sergei Yesenin).

While the Silver Age is considered to be the development of the 19th-century Russian Golden Age literature tradition, some modernist and avant-garde poets tried to overturn it. Most prominent their movements: the Cubo-Futurism with practice of &quot;zaum&quot;, the experimental visual and sound poetry (David Burliuk, Velimir Khlebnikov, Aleksei Kruchenykh, Nikolai Aseyev, Vladimir Mayakovsky); the Ego-Futurism based on a personality cult (Igor Severyanin and Vasilisk Gnedov); and the Acmeist poetry, a Russian modernist school, which emerged ca. 1911 and to symbols preferred direct expression through exact images (Anna Akhmatova, Nikolay Gumilev, Georgiy Ivanov, Mikhail Kuzmin, Osip Mandelstam).

Though the Silver Age is famous mostly for its poetry, it produced some first-rate novelists and short-story writers, such as naturalist Aleksandr Kuprin, realists Nobel Prize winner Ivan Bunin and Vikenty Veresaev, pioneer of Russian expressionism Leonid Andreyev, symbolists Fedor Sologub, Aleksey Remizov, Dmitry Merezhkovsky, Andrei Bely, Alexander Belyaev, and Yevgeny Zamyatin, though most of them wrote poetry as well as prose.

In 1915/16, the school of Russian Formalism, wary of the futurists and highly influential for the global theory of literary criticism and poetics, appeared; its programmatic article &quot;The Resurrection of the Word&quot; by the scholar and writer Viktor Shklovsky (1893–1984) was published in 1914, and the peak of activity occurred in the post-revolutionary &#x27;20s.

An integral part of the literature of the Silver Age is Russian philosophy, which reached its peak at this time (see works of Nikolai Berdyaev, Pavel Florensky, Semyon Frank, Nikolay Lossky, Vasily Rozanov, and others).

==Soviet era==
===Early post-Revolutionary era===

The first years of the Soviet regime after the October Revolution of 1917, featured a proliferation of Russian avant-garde literary groups, and proletarian literature receive official support. The Imaginists were post-Revolution poetic movement, similar to English-language Imagists, that created poetry based on sequences of arresting and uncommon images. The major figures include Sergei Yesenin, Anatoly Marienhof, and Rurik Ivnev. Another important movement was the Oberiu (1927–1930s), which included the most famous Russian absurdist Daniil Kharms (1905–1942), Konstantin Vaginov (1899–1934), Alexander Vvedensky (1904–1941) and Nikolay Zabolotsky (1903–1958). Other famous authors experimenting with language included the novelists Boris Pilnyak (1894–1938), Yuri Olesha (1899–1960), Andrei Platonov (1899–1951) and Artyom Vesyoly (1899–1938), the short-story writers Isaak Babel (1894–1940) and Mikhail Zoshchenko (1894–1958). The OPOJAZ group of literary critics, a part of Russian formalism school, was founded in 1916 in close connection with Russian Futurism. Two of its members also produced influential literary works, namely Viktor Shklovsky, whose numerous books (&quot;A Sentimental Journey&quot; and &quot;Zoo, or Letters Not About Love&quot;, both 1923) defy genre in that they present a novel mix of narration, autobiography, and aesthetic as well as social commentary, and Yury Tynyanov (1893–1943), who used his knowledge of Russia&#x27;s literary history to produce a set of historical novels mainly set in the Pushkin era (e.g., &quot;Lieutenant Kijé&quot;, &quot;Pushkin&quot; in three parts, 1935–43, and others).

Following the establishment of Bolshevik rule, Vladimir Mayakovsky worked on interpreting the facts of the new reality. His works, such as &quot;Ode to the Revolution&quot; and &quot;Left March&quot; (both 1918), brought innovations to poetry. In &quot;Left March&quot;, Mayakovsky calls for a struggle against the enemies of the Russian Revolution. The poem &quot;150 000 000&quot; (1921) discusses the leading role played by the masses in the revolution. In the poem &quot;Vladimir Ilyich Lenin&quot; (1924), Mayakovsky looks at the life and work at the leader of Russia&#x27;s revolution and depicts them against a broad historical background. In the poem &quot;All Right!&quot; (1927), Mayakovsky writes about socialist society as the &quot;springtime of humanity&quot;. Mayakovsky was instrumental in producing a new type of poetry in which politics played a major part.

One of the most popular Soviet poets during the 1920s was Nikolai Tikhonov (1896–1979), a future important figure of Stalinist era, well-known for his &quot;Ballad About Nails&quot;, as follows:


===&quot;Émigré&quot; writers===
Usually, Russian &quot;émigré&quot; literature is understood as the works of the white émigré, namely the first post-Revolutionary wave, although in the broad sense of the word, it also includes Soviet dissidents of the late years through the 1980s. Meanwhile, émigré writers, such as poets Georgy Ivanov, Vyacheslav Ivanov, Vladislav Khodasevich, surrealist Boris Poplavsky (1903–1935), and members of the 1920s–50s Paris Note (French: &quot;Note parisienne&quot;) Russian poetry movement (Georgy Adamovich, Igor Chinnov, George Ivask, Anatoly Shteiger, Lidia Tcherminskaia); novelists such as M. Ageyev, Mark Aldanov, Gaito Gazdanov, Pyotr Krasnov, Aleksandr Kuprin, Dmitry Merezhkovsky, Aleksey Remizov, Ivan Shmelyov, George Grebenstchikoff, Yevgeny Zamyatin, Vladimir Nabokov, and English-speaking Ayn Rand; and short-story Nobel Prize-winning writer and poet Ivan Bunin, continued to write in exile. During his emigration Bunin wrote his most significant works, such as his only autobiographical novel &quot;The Life of Arseniev&quot; (1927–1939) and short story cycle &quot;Dark Avenues&quot; (1937–1944). An example of long prose form is Grebenstchikoff&#x27;s epic novel &quot;The Churaevs&quot; in six volumes (1922–1937) in which he described life of the Siberians. While the realists Bunin, Shmelyov and Grebenstchikoff wrote about the pre-revolutionary Russia, life of the émigrés was depicted in modernist Nabokov&#x27;s &quot;Mary&quot; (1926)&quot; and The Gift&quot; (1938), Gazdanov&#x27;s &quot;An Evening with Claire&quot; (1929) and &quot;The Specter of Alexander Wolf&quot; (1948) and Georgy Ivanov&#x27;s novel &quot;Disintegration of the Atom&quot; (1938).

===Stalinist era===
In the 1930s, Socialist realism became the predominant official trend in the Soviet Union. Writers like those of the Serapion Brothers group (1921–), who insisted on the right of an author to write independently of political ideology, were forced by authorities to reject their views and accept socialist realist principles. Some 1930s writers, such as Osip Mandelstam, Daniil Kharms, leader of Oberiu, Leonid Dobychin, Mikhail Bulgakov, author of &quot;The White Guard&quot; (1923) and &quot;The Master and Margarita&quot; (1928–1940), and Andrei Platonov, author of novels &quot;Chevengur&quot; (1928) and &quot;The Foundation Pit&quot; (1930) were attacked by the official critics as &quot;formalists,&quot; &quot;naturalists&quot; and ideological enemies and wrote with little or no hope of being published. Such remarkable writers as Isaac Babel, Boris Pilnyak, Nikolai Klyuev, Sergey Klychkov, Pyotr Oreshin and Artyom Vesyoly, who continued to publish their works but could not get used to the socrealist principles by the end of the 1930s, were executed on fabricated charges, and Osip Mandelstam, Daniil Kharms and Alexander Vvedensky died in prison.

The return from emigration such famous authors as Aleksey Tolstoy, Maxim Gorky, and Ilya Ehrenburg was a major propaganda victory for the Soviets.

After his return to Russia Maxim Gorky was proclaimed by the Soviet authorities as &quot;the founder of Socialist Realism&quot;. His novel &quot;Mother&quot; (1906), which Gorky himself considered one of his biggest failures, inspired proletarian writers to found the socrealist movement. Gorky defined socialist realism as the &quot;realism of people who are rebuilding the world&quot; and pointed out that it looks at the past &quot;from the heights of the future&#x27;s goals&quot;, although he defined it not as a strict style (which is studied in Andrei Sinyavsky&#x27;s essay &quot;On Socialist Realism&quot;), but as a label for the &quot;union of writers of styles&quot;, who write for one purpose, to help in the development of the new man in socialist society. Gorky became the initiator of creating the Writer&#x27;s Union, a state organization, intended to unite the socrealist writers. Despite the official reputation, Gorky&#x27;s post-revolutionary works, such as the novel &quot;The Life of Klim Samgin&quot; (1925–1936) can&#x27;t be defined as socrealist, but modernist.

Andrei Bely (1880–1934), author of &quot;Petersburg&quot; (1913/1922), a well-known modernist writer, also was a member of Writer&#x27;s Union and tried to become a &quot;true&quot; socrealist by writing a series of articles and making ideological revisions to his memoirs, and he also planned to begin a study of Socialist realism. However, he continued writing with his unique techniques. Although he was actively published during his lifetime, his major works would not be reissued until the end of the 1970s.

Valentin Kataev, who began publishing before the Revolution, is the author of the first Soviet &quot;industrial novel&quot; &quot;Time, Forward!&quot; (1932) and the classic 1946 short story &quot;Our Father&quot;.

Mikhail Sholokhov (1905–1984) was one of the most significant figures in the official Soviet literature. His main socrealist work is &quot;Virgin Soil Upturned&quot; (1935), a novel in which Sholokhov glorifies the collectivization. However, his best-known and the most significant literary achievement is &quot;Quiet Flows the Don&quot; (1928–1940), an epic novel which realistically depicts the life of Don Cossacks during the First World War, the Russian Revolution, and Russian Civil War.

Nikolai Ostrovsky&#x27;s novel &quot;How the Steel Was Tempered&quot; (1932–1934) has been among the most popular works of literary socrealism, with tens of millions of copies printed in many languages around the world. In China, various versions of the book have sold more than 10 million copies. In Russia more than 35 million copies of the book are in circulation. The book is a fictionalized autobiography of Ostrovsky&#x27;s life: he had a difficult working-class childhood, became a Komsomol member in July 1919 and volunteered to join the Red Army. The novel&#x27;s protagonist, Pavel Korchagin, represented the &quot;young hero&quot; of Russian literature: he is dedicated to his political causes, which help him to overcome his tragedies. Alexander Fadeyev (1901–1956) was also a well-known Socialist realism writer, the chairman of the official Writer&#x27;s Union during Stalinist era. His novel &quot;The Rout&quot; (1927) deals with the partisan struggle in Russia&#x27;s Far East during the Russian Revolution and Civil War of 1917–1922. Fadeyev described the theme of this novel as one of a revolution significantly transforming the masses.

In the 1930s, Konstantin Paustovsky (1892–1968), an influenced by neo-Romantic works of Alexander Grin master of landscape prose, a singer of the Meshchera Lowlands, and already in the post-Stalin years a multiple nominee for the Nobel Prize in Literature, joined the ranks of leading Soviet writers.fantastic.

Novelist and playwright Leonid Leonov, despite the fact that he was considered by authorities to be one of the pillars of socialist realism, during the Stalin years, created a forbidden novella about emigrats &quot;Eugenua Ivanovna&quot; (1938), a play about the Chekist purges, &quot;The Snowstorm&quot; (1940), briefly permitted and then also forbidden, and a novel, &quot;The Russian Forest&quot; (1953), where ecological issues were perhaps touched upon for the first time in Soviet literature. Over the course of forty years (1940–1994), he wrote a huge philosophical and mystical novel, &quot;The Pyramid&quot;, which was finished and published in the year of the author&#x27;s death.

The cult figures of the literature of the Second World War were the war poets Konstantin Simonov, arguably most famous for his 1941 poem &quot;Wait for Me&quot;, and Aleksandr Tvardovsky, author of the long poem &quot;Vasily Tyorkin&quot; (1941–45), chief editor of the literary magazine &quot;Novy Mir&quot;. Poet Yulia Drunina known for writing about women at war.

Boris Polevoy is the author of the &quot;Story About a True Man&quot; (1946), based on the life of World War II fighter pilot Aleksey Maresyev, which was an immensely popular.

===Late Soviet era===
After the end of World War II Nobel Prize-winning Boris Pasternak (1890–1960) wrote a novel &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (1945–1955). Publication of the novel in Italy caused a scandal, as the Soviet authorities forced Pasternak to renounce his 1958 Nobel Prize and denounced as an internal White emigre and a Fascist fifth columnist. Pasternak was expelled from the Writer&#x27;s Union.

The majority of members of the Writers&#x27; Union (Georgi Markov, Anatoly Rybakov, Aleksandr Chakovsky, Sergey Zalygin, Anatoly Kalinin, Daniil Granin, Yuri Nagibin, Vladimir Tendryakov, Arkady Lvov (before his emigration), Chinghiz Aitmatov, Anatoly Ivanov, Pyotr Proskurin, Boris Yekimov, among many others) continued to work in the mainstream of Socialist Realism, not without criticizing certain phenomena of Soviet reality, such as showiness, mismanagement, nepotism, and widespread poaching. However, even in officially recognized literature, not entirely canonical &quot;mutations&quot;—the natural Lieutenant, nostalgic Village and intellectual &quot;Urban Prose&quot; (Yury Trifonov), the literature of the Sixtiers and &quot;Quiet Poetry&quot; movements appear. Since the 1960s, Valentin Kataev has been moving away from official realism, developing his own modernist style, &quot;Mauvism&quot; (from the French word &quot;mauvais&quot;, &quot;bad&quot;).

The Khrushchev Thaw () brought some fresh wind to literature (the term was coined after Ilya Ehrenburg&#x27;s 1954 novel &quot;The Thaw&quot;). Published in 1956, Vladimir Dudintsev&#x27;s novel &quot;Not by Bread Alone&quot; and Yury Dombrovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Keeper of Antiquities&quot; in 1964 became two of the main literary events of the Thaw and a milestone in the process of de-Stalinization, but was soon criticized and withdrawn from circulation. The last years of life were fruitful for Nikolay Zabolotsky, who was repressed during the Stalin years. The publication in 1962 of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn&#x27;s debut story &quot;One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich&quot; about a political prisoner became a national and international sensation. Poetry of the Sixtiers or Russian New Wave became a mass-cultural phenomenon: Bella Akhmadulina, Boris Slutsky, Victor Sosnora, Robert Rozhdestvensky, Andrei Voznesensky, and Yevgeny Yevtushenko, read their poems in stadiums and attracted huge crowds, as follows:
Such exponents of neo-Acmeist poetry as Arseny Tarkovsky, Semyon Lipkin, David Samoylov, Alexander Kushner and Oleg Chukhontsev, the representatives &quot;quiet poetry&quot; Anatoly Zhigulin, Stanislav Kunyaev, Nikolay Rubtsov and Yury Kuznetsov, and also Gleb Gorbovsky, bard Novella Matveyeva, Yunna Morits, and Gleb Semenov&#x27;s lyrical poetry also stood apart from the socrealist mainstream.

The Village Prose was a movement in Soviet literature beginning during the Khrushchev Thaw, which included works that cultivated nostalgia of rural life. Valentin Ovechkin&#x27;s story &quot;District Routine&quot; (1952), expose managerial inefficiency, the self-interest of party functionaries, was the starting point of the movement. Its major members Alexander Yashin, Fyodor Abramov, Boris Mozhayev, Viktor Astafyev, Vladimir Soloukhin, Vasily Shukshin, Vasily Belov, and Valentin Rasputin clustered in the traditionalist and nationalist &quot;Nash Sovremennik&quot; literary magazine.

Since 1985/86, the &quot;Perestroika&quot;—a period of great changes in the political and cultural life in the USSR—gave way to a wide diversity of banned previously and new writings. In 1986 there was established the legal non-Realistic literary club &quot;Poetry&quot;, among its members were Dmitry Prigov, Igor Irtenyev, Aleksandr Yeryomenko, Sergey Gandlevsky, and Yuri Arabov. Many previously suppressed works were published among first, in 1986–87, anti-Stalinist Alexander Bek&#x27;s novel &quot;The New Appointment&quot; (1965) and Anatoly Rybakov&#x27;s &quot;Children of the Arbat&quot; trilogy. The events of the theater of the absurd were postmodern plays of Nina Sadur.

====Soviet nonconformism====
Some writers dared to oppose Soviet ideology, like short-story writer Varlam Shalamov (1907–1982) and Nobel Prize-winning novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn (1918–2008), who wrote about life in the gulag camps, or Vasily Grossman (1905–1964), with his description of World War II events countering the Soviet official historiography (his epic novel &quot;Life and Fate&quot; (1959) was not published in the Soviet Union until the &quot;perestroika&quot;). Such writers, dubbed &quot;dissidents&quot;, could not publish their major works until the 1960s.

Modernist and Postmodern dissident literature was related and partially coincided with the Soviet nonconformist art movement. From 1953 to 1957, the &quot;Mansard Group&quot;—first unofficial poetry group—existed till its leader Leonid Chertkov (1933–2000) was imprisoned, among other members Galina Andreeva (1933–2016) and Stanislav Krasovitsky (b. 1935). Another poetry group of &#x27;50s in Leningrad was the &quot;Philological School&quot; that included Mikhail Eremin (1936–2022), Sergey Kulle (1936–1984), Leonid Vinogradov (1936–2004) and poet and artist Vladimir Uflyand (1937–2007). Some poets were both artists or participants and inspirers of art groups, such as Evgenii Kropivnitsky (1893–1979), Igor Kholin, Genrikh Sapgir, Vilen Barskyi (1930–2012), Roald Mandelstam (1932–1961), Vsevolod Nekrasov (1934–2009), Mikhail Eremin (1936–2022), Igor Sinyavin (1937–2000), Alexei Khvostenko (1940–2004), Dmitry Prigov (1940–2007), Kari Unksova (1941–1983), Ry Nikonova (1942–2014), Oleg Grigoriev (1943–1992), Valery Kholodenko (1945–1993), Serge Segay (1947–2014), and Vladimir Sorokin (b. 1955).

But the late 1950s thaw did not last long. In the 1970s, some of the most prominent authors were not only banned from publishing but were also prosecuted for their anti-Soviet sentiments, or for parasitism, thus writers Yuli Daniel (1925–1988) and Leonid Borodin (1938–2011) was imprisoned. Solzhenitsyn and Nobel Prize–winning poet Joseph Brodsky (1940–1996) were expelled from the country. Others, such as writers and poets David Dar (1910–1980), Viktor Nekrasov (1911–1987), Lev Kopelev (1912–1997), Aleksandr Galich (1918–1977), Arkadiy Belinkov (1921–2019), Elizaveta Mnatsakanova (1922–2006), Alexander Zinoviev (1922–2006), Naum Korzhavin (1925–2018), Andrei Sinyavsky (1925–1997), Arkady Lvov (1927–2020), Yuz Aleshkovsky (1929–2022), Anatoly Kuznetsov (1929–1979), Vilen Barskyi, Vladimir Maksimov (1930–1995), Yuri Mamleev (1931–2015), Georgi Vladimov (1931–2003), Vasily Aksyonov (1932–2009), Vladimir Voinovich (1932–2018), Leonid Chertkov, Anatoly Gladilin (1935–2018), Anri Volokhonsky (1936–2017), Andrei Bitov (1937–2018), Igor Sinyavin, Alexei Khvostenko, Sergei Dovlatov (1941–1990), Eduard Limonov (1943–2020), and Sasha Sokolov (b. 1943), had to emigrate to the West, while Oleg Grigoriev and Venedikt Yerofeyev (1938–1990) &quot;emigrated&quot; to alcoholism, and repressed still in Stalinist years poet Yury Aikhenvald (1928–1993) with some others to translations, and Kari Unksova and Yury Dombrovsky (1909–1978) were murdered, Dombrovsky shortly after publishing his novel &quot;The Faculty of Useless Knowledge&quot; (1975). Their books were not published officially until the &quot;perestroika&quot; period of the 1980s, although fans continued to reprint them manually in a manner called &quot;samizdat&quot; (self-publishing).

In 1960s arose unofficial Soviet second Russian avant-garde and Russian postmodernism. In 1965–72, at Leningrad existed the avantgardist Absurdist poetic and writing group &quot;Khelenkuts&quot;, which included Vladimir Erl and Aleksandr Mironov, among others. Andrei Bitov was Postmodernism first proponent. In 1970, Venedikt Erofeyev&#x27;s surrealist postmodern prose poem &quot;Moscow-Petushki&quot; was published via &quot;samizdat&quot;. The Soviet emigrant Sasha Sokolov wrote surrealist &quot;A School for Fools&quot; in 1973 and the completely postmodern novel &quot;Between Dog and Wolf&quot; in 1980. 
Other remarkable postmodern novels were Eduard Limonov&#x27;s &quot;It&#x27;s Me, Eddie&quot;, Vladimir Voinovich&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Extraordinary Adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin&quot;, Vasily Aksyonov&#x27;s &quot;The Island of Crimea&quot; and Vladimir Sorokin&#x27;s &quot;The Norm&quot;. Sergei Dovlatov and Yevgeni Popov predominantly wrote short stories. Since &#x27;70s there were such postmodern unofficial movements as Moscow Conceptualists with elements of concrete poetry (Vsevolod Nekrasov, Dmitry Prigov, writer and literary scholar Viktor Yerofeyev, Lev Rubinstein, Timur Kibirov, early Vladimir Sorokin) and Metarealism, namely metaphysical realism, used complex metaphors which they called meta-metaphors (Konstantin Kedrov, Viktor Krivulin, Elena Katsyuba, Ivan Zhdanov, Elena Shvarts, Vladimir Aristov, Aleksandr Yeryomenko, scholar Svetlana Kekova, Yuri Arabov, Alexei Parshchikov, Sergei Nadeem and Nikolai Kononov). Arkadii Dragomoshchenko is considered the foremost representative of the Language Poets in Russian literature. In Yeysk, there was the &quot;Transfurist&quot; group of mixing verbal, sound and visual poetry (Ry Nikonova and Serge Segay, among others). As mentioned Leonid Vinogradov, as well as members of &quot;List of characters&quot; group Mikhail Faynerman and Ivan Akhmetyev were exponents of Minimalist verse. The banned from publishing Chuvash and Russian poet Gennadiy Aygi had been creating experimental surrealist verses as follows:

Among other underground poets and writers were the exponent of stream of consciousness prose Pavel Ulitin, Dmitry Avaliani, Yevgeny Kharitonov, economist and poet Yevgeny Saburov, Elena Ignatova, Mikhail Aizenberg and Yevgeny Bunimovich, as well partially banned Vladimir Dudintsev, Fazil Iskander and Olga Sedakova.

===Popular Soviet genres===
Children&#x27;s literature in the Soviet Union counted as a major genre because of its educational role. A large share of early-Soviet children&#x27;s books were poems: Korney Chukovsky (1882–1969), Samuil Marshak (1887–1964) and Agnia Barto (1906–1981) were among the most read poets. &quot;Adult&quot; poets, such as Mayakovsky and Sergey Mikhalkov (1913–2009), contributed to the genre as well. Some of the early Soviet children&#x27;s prose consisted of loose adaptations of foreign fairy-tales unknown in contemporary Russia. Alexey N. Tolstoy (1882–1945) wrote &quot;Buratino&quot;, a light-hearted and shortened adaptation of Carlo Collodi&#x27;s &quot;Pinocchio&quot;. Alexander Volkov (1891–1977) introduced fantasy fiction to Soviet children with his loose translation of L. Frank Baum&#x27;s &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, published as &quot;The Wizard of the Emerald City&quot; in 1939, and then wrote a series of five sequels, unrelated to Baum. Other notable authors include Nikolay Nosov (1908–1976), Lazar Lagin (1903–1979), Vitaly Bianki (1894–1959) and Vladimir Suteev (1903–1993).

While fairy tales were relatively free from ideological oppression, the realistic children&#x27;s prose of the Stalinist era was highly ideological and pursued the goal to raise children as patriots and communists. A notable writer in this vein was Arkady Gaydar (1904–1941), himself a Red Army commander (colonel) in Russian Civil War: his stories and plays about Timur describe a team of young pioneer volunteers who help the elderly and resist hooligans. There was a genre of hero-pioneer story that bore some similarities with Christian genre of hagiography. In the times of Khrushchov (First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union from 1953 to 1964) and of Brezhnev (in power 1966–1982), however, the pressure lightened. Mid- and late-Soviet children&#x27;s books by Eduard Uspensky, Yuri Entin, Viktor Dragunsky bear no signs of propaganda. In the 1970s many of these books, as well as stories by foreign children&#x27;s writers, were adapted into animation.

The famous and widely popular satirists were Mikhail Zoshchenko, Valentin Kataev and the writing tandem Ilf and Petrov, described problems of post-Revolutionary Soviet society.

Soviet Science fiction, inspired by scientistic revolution, industrialisation, and the country&#x27;s space pioneering, was flourishing, albeit in the limits allowed by censors. Early science fiction authors, such as Alexander Belyaev, Grigory Adamov, Vladimir Obruchev, Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy, stuck to hard science fiction and regarded H. G. Wells and Jules Verne as examples to follow. Two notable exceptions to this trend were early Soviet dissidents Yevgeny Zamyatin, author of dystopian novel &quot;We&quot;, and Mikhail Bulgakov, who used science fiction in &quot;Heart of a Dog&quot;, &quot;The Fatal Eggs&quot; and &quot;Ivan Vasilyevich&quot; to satirize Communist ideology vs. what it is actual practice. Like the dissident writers of the future, Zamyatin and Bulgakov had serious problems with publishing their books due to censorship in the Soviet Union.

Since the Khrushchev thaw in the 1950s, Soviet science fiction began to form its own style. Philosophy, ethics, utopian and dystopian ideas became its core, and Social science fiction was the most popular subgenre. Although the view of Earth&#x27;s future as that of utopian communist society was the only view that was welcome, the liberties of genre still offered a loophole for free expression. Books of brothers Arkady and Boris Strugatsky, and Kir Bulychev, among others, are reminiscent of social problems and often include satire of contemporary Soviet society. Ivan Yefremov, on the contrary, arose to fame with his utopian views on future as well as on Ancient Greece in his historical novels. The Strugatskies are also credited for the Soviet&#x27;s first science fantasy, the Monday Begins on Saturday trilogy. Other notable science fiction writers included Vladimir Savchenko, Georgy Gurevich, Alexander Kazantsev, Georgy Martynov, Yeremey Parnov. 

Space opera was less developed, since both state censors and serious writers watched it unfavorably. Nevertheless, there were moderately successful attempts to adapt space westerns to Soviet soil. The first was Alexander Kolpakov with &quot;Griada&quot;, after came Sergey Snegov with &quot;Men Like Gods&quot;, among others.

A specific branch of both science fiction and children&#x27;s books appeared in mid-Soviet era: the children&#x27;s science fiction. It was meant to educate children while entertaining them. The star of the genre was Bulychov, who, along with his adult books, created children&#x27;s space adventure series about Alisa Selezneva, a teenage girl from the future. Others include Nikolay Nosov with his books about dwarf Neznayka, Evgeny Veltistov, who wrote about robot boy Electronic, Vitaly Melentyev, Vladislav Krapivin, Vitaly Gubarev.

Mystery was another popular genre. Detectives by Vayner Brothers and spy novels by Yulian Semyonov were best-selling, and many of them were adapted into film or TV in the 1970s and 1980s.

Village Prose is a genre that conveys nostalgic descriptions of rural life. Valentin Rasputin&#x27;s 1976 novel, 
&quot;Proshchaniye s Matyoroy&quot; (&quot;Farewell to Matyora&quot;) depicted a village faced with destruction to make room for a hydroelectric plant.

Historical fiction in the early Soviet era included a large share of memoirs, fictionalized or not. Valentin Katayev and Lev Kassil wrote semi-autobiographic books about children&#x27;s life in Tsarist Russia. Vladimir Gilyarovsky wrote &quot;Moscow and Muscovites&quot;, about life in pre-revolutionary Moscow. There were also attempts to write an epic novel about the Revolution, similar to Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot;, based on the writers&#x27; own experience. Aleksey Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;The Road to Calvary&quot; (1920–1941) and Mikhail Sholokhov&#x27;s &quot;And Quiet Flows the Don&quot; (1928–1940) depict Russia from the start of the Revolution to the end of the Civil War. &quot;The Road to Calvary&quot; demonstrates the victory of socialist ideas, while &quot;And Quiet Flows the Don&quot; gives a realist and a brutal image. Maxim Gorky&#x27;s and Andrei Bely&#x27;s experimental novels &quot;The Life of Klim Samgin&quot; (1925–1936) and &quot;Moscow&quot; (1926–1931) trace the relationship of Russian &quot;intelligentsia&quot; with the revolutionary movement. Mikhail Bulgakov conceived to write a trilogy about the Civil War, but wrote only the first part, &quot;The White Guard&quot; (1923). Yury Tynyanov focused on fictional biographies of the Golden Age writers: &quot;The Death of Vazir-Mukhtar&quot; (1928) and &quot;Pushkin&quot; (1935–1943). The late Soviet historical fiction was dominated by World War II novels and short stories by authors such as the representatives of Lieutenant prose (such as Vasil Bykov), Vasily Grossman, Konstantin Simonov, Boris Vasilyev, Viktor Astafyev, among others, based on the authors&#x27; own war experience. Vasily Yan and Konstantin Badygin are best known for their novels on Medieval Rus, and Yury Tynyanov for writing on Russian Empire. Valentin Pikul wrote about many different epochs and countries in an Alexander Dumas-inspired style. In the 1970s there appeared a relatively independent Village Prose, whose most prominent representatives were Viktor Astafyev and Valentin Rasputin.

Any sort of fiction that dealt with the occult, either horror, adult-oriented fantasy or magic realism, was unwelcome in Soviet Russia. Until the 1980s very few books in these genres were written, and even fewer were published, although earlier books, such as by Gogol, were not banned. Of the rare exceptions, Bulgakov in &quot;Master and Margarita&quot; (not published in author&#x27;s lifetime) and Strugatskies in &quot;Monday Begins on Saturday&quot; introduced magic and mystical creatures into contemporary Soviet reality to satirize it. Another exception was early Soviet writer Alexander Grin, who wrote neo-Romantic tales, both realistic and fantastic.

==Bronze Age==

===Post-Soviet 1990s===
The end of the 20th century proved a difficult period for Russian literature, with relatively few distinct voices. Although the limited censorship of the period of &quot;glasnost&quot; was lifted, &quot;de facto&quot; since 1989 in the Soviet Union, &quot;de jure&quot; in 1990, and writers could now freely express their thoughts, the political and economic chaos of the 1990s affected the book market and literature heavily. The book printing industry descended into crisis, the number of printed book copies dropped several times in comparison to Soviet era, and it took about a decade to revive.

Among the most discussed figures of this period were authors Victor Pelevin (b. 1962), disputably related to postmodernism and the New Sincerity movement, who is author of the Zen-inspired &quot;Chapayev and the Void&quot;, &quot;the first novel which takes place in an absolute vacuum,&quot; postmodernist novelist and playwright Vladimir Sorokin (b. 1955, the novels &quot;Their Four Hearts&quot; and &quot;Blue Lard&quot;), who started an underground writing career still in the early 80s, and the conceptualist poet Dmitry Prigov (1940–2007). Among other significant Postmodern works are Lyudmila Petrushevskaya&#x27;s novella &quot;The Time: Night&quot;, Anatoly Korolyov&#x27;s novel &quot;Eron&quot;, Yevgeni Popov&#x27;s novel &quot;The Real Story of the &quot;Green musicians&quot;&quot;, Tatyana Tolstaya&#x27;s novel &quot;The Stynx&quot;, Vladimir Sharov&#x27;s historiosophical prose as well the Israeli literary scholar and later novelist Alexander Goldstein&#x27;s variable essays.

The tradition of the classic Russian realistic novel with modernist, magic realism and new &quot;postrealism&quot; elements continues with such authors as: (1) the living Soviet classics Leonid Leonov, Viktor Astafyev, Yury Davydov (novel &quot;The Bestseller&quot;), Valentin Rasputin, Viktoriya Tokareva and Vladimir Makanin; (2) the Soviet nonconformists Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, Georgi Vladimov (a novel &quot;The General and His Army&quot;) and Vasily Aksyonov (the trilogy &quot;Generations of Winter&quot;); (3) &quot;new wave&quot; of playwright and theatre director Nikolay Kolyada (b. 1957), Aleksey Varlamov (b. 1963), Pavel Krusanov (b. 1961) and Mikhail Shishkin (b. 1961). Short stories of Sergei Dovlatov who emigrated to the US in 1979 and died in 1990 became very popular in Russia posthumously.

A relatively new trend in Russian literature is that female short story writers mentioned Viktoriya Tokareva and Lyudmila Petrushevskaya or Tatyana Tolstaya, and novelists Lyudmila Ulitskaya, Nina Sadur, Irina Polyanskaya (1952–2004), Dina Rubina or Valeriya Narbikova (b. 1958) have come into prominence.

Detective stories and thrillers have proven a very successful genre of new Russian literature: in the 1990s serial detective novels by Alexandra Marinina, Polina Dashkova and Darya Dontsova were published in millions of copies. In the next decade Boris Akunin who wrote more sophisticated popular fiction, e.g. a series of novels about the 19th century sleuth Erast Fandorin, was eagerly read across the country.

Science fiction was always well selling, albeit second to fantasy, that was relatively new to Russian readers. These genres boomed in the late 1990s, with authors like Sergey Lukyanenko, Nick Perumov, Maria Semenova, Vera Kamsha, Alexey Pekhov, Anton Vilgotsky and Vadim Panov. A good share of modern Russian science fiction and fantasy is written in Ukraine, especially in Kharkiv, home to H. L. Oldie, Alexander Zorich, Yuri Nikitin and Andrey Valentinov. Many others hail from Kyiv, including Marina and Sergey Dyachenko and Vladimir Arenev. Significant contribution to Russian horror literature has been done by Ukrainians Andrey Dashkov and Alexander Vargo.

Russian poetry of that period produced a number of avant-garde greats. The Moscow Conceptualists and followers of Concrete poetry, such as mentioned Dmitry Prigov, Lev Rubinstein, Anna Alchuk and Timur Kibirov (also novelist and literary scholar Viktor Yerofeyev), and the members of the Lianosovo group of nonconformist poets, notably Genrikh Sapgir, Igor Kholin and Vsevolod Nekrasov, who previously chose to refrain from publication in Soviet periodicals, became very influential, especially in Moscow, and the same goes for another masterful experimental neo-surrealist Chuvash and Russian poet, Gennadiy Aygi. Also popular were poets following some other poetic trends, e.g. members of &quot;neo-Baroque&quot; poetry school (not to be confused with neo-Baroque architecture) Ivan Zhdanov, Elena Shvarts, Aleksandr Yeryomenko and Alexei Parshchikov, Konstantin Kedrov and Elena Katsuba from &quot;DOOS&quot;, scholar Svetlana Kekova, Sergei Nadeem and Nikolai Kononov from Saratov club &quot;Cocoon&quot;, Vladimir Aristov, Yuri Arabov and other representatives of the 1970–80s Metarealism, who all used complex metaphors which they called meta-metaphors; in St. Petersburg, members of &quot;New Leningrad Poetry School&quot; that included not only the famous Joseph Brodsky but also Viktor Krivulin, Sergey Stratanovsky and Elena Shvarts, and such members of &quot;Philological School&quot; as Mikhail Eremin, Leonid Vinogradov, Vladimir Uflyand and the Russian-American scholar Lev Loseff, were prominent first in the Soviet-times underground—and later in mainstream poetry; minimalist verse was represented since 1970s by members of &quot;List of characters&quot; group Mikhail Faynerman, Ivan Akhmetyev and later by Alexander Makarov-Krotkov; in 1992 emerged, the Meloimaginist group related to previous Imaginism and included such poets and novelists as Russian-Irish bilingual Anatoly Kudryavitsky and Ludmila Vaturina; among other names, poets with nonconformist background Russian-Austrian musicolog Elizaveta Mnatsakanova, Galina Andreeva, Leonid Chertkov, Stanislav Krasovitsky, Dmitry Avaliani, Ry Nikonova, economist Yevgeny Saburov, Russian-Israeli author Elena Ignatova, Mikhail Aizenberg, Yevgeny Bunimovich and Dimitry Grigoriev, also poet and writer Nikolaĭ Baĭtov, the Russian-German scholar Sergey Biryukov with futurist and surrealist background, Irina Iermakova, Vitaly Kalpidi, the unable to publish during Soviet years scholar Olga Sedakova, and Boris Khersonsky. Notable poets of younger generation are Elena Fanailova (b. 1962), German Lukomnikov (b. 1962), Vera Pavlova (b. 1963), Grigory Dashevsky (1964–2013), Sergei Kruglov (b. 1966), Dmitry Kuzmin (b. 1968), Arseniy Rovinsky (b. 1968), Asya Shneiderman (b. 1968), Maxim Amelin (b. 1970), Mikhail Gronas (b. 1970), Fyodor Svarovsky (b. 1971), Stanislav Lvovsky (b. 1972), Maria Stepanova (b. 1972), Alina Vitukhnovskaya (b. 1973), Inga Kuznetsova (b. 1974), Boris Ryzhy (1974–2001), Shish Bryansky (b. 1975), Linor Goralik (b. 1975), Kirill Medvedev (b. 1975), and Polina Barskova (b. 1976).

===21st century===

At the beginning of the 21st century, Victor Pelevin and Vladimir Sorokin remained the leading and prolific Russian writers. Pelevin became the most extensively translated one into English. Also significant are the new works of Boris Akunin (adventure fiction), Lyudmila Ulitskaya (the &quot;Daniel Stein, Interpreter&quot;, a novel about the Holocaust and interreligious relations), and Mikhali Shishkin (the novel &quot;Maidenhair&quot;).

Among the debutants in prose are Eduard Kochergin (b. 1937) with his novels &quot;Angel&#x27;s Doll&quot; and &quot;Baptized with Crosses&quot;, Alexei Ivanov (b. 1969) known for his novel &quot;The Heart of Parma&quot;, a Russian-Israeli writer and poet in the philosophical-symbolic vein Alexander Ilichevsky (b. 1970), who wrote &quot;The Persian&quot; and the &quot;Newton&#x27;s Drawing&quot;, the author of novel &quot;The Librarian&quot; Mikhail Elizarov (b. 1973), and German Sadulaev (b. 1973) with the book &quot;I am a Chechen!&quot; In the second decade of the century, the following novelists gained fame: Eugene Vodolazkin (b. 1964) for &quot;The Laurus&quot; (one of ten best world novels about God by &quot;The Guardian&quot; version), Sofia Sinitskaya (b. 1972), the author of the neutral novel &quot;Black Siberia&quot; on Russo-Ukrainian War, and Alexei Salnikov (b. 1978) for his hallucinatory &quot;The Petrovs in and Around the Flu&quot; (regarded as a rare outstanding text, see also the film &quot;Petrov&#x27;s Flu&quot;). In the form of popular fiction, post-apocalyptic novels of Dmitry Glukhovsky (b. 1979) are successful.

Almost all of the authors named criticized Putinism and have left Russia. After 2022, they have been &quot;canceled&quot; and their books have been withdrawn from a number of Russian booksellers. Examples of active supporters of the political regime among eminent writers are poet Yunna Morits (b. 1937) and nationalists Alexander Prokhanov (b. 1938), Yurii Poliakov (b. 1954) Pavel Krusanov (b. 1961) and Zakhar Prilepin (b. 1975).

A new generation of Russian authors appeared, differing greatly from the postmodernist Russian prose of the late 20th century, which led critics to speak about &quot;new realism&quot; as one of several contemporary literary trends (Pavel Basinsky (b. 1961), Aleksey Varlamov (b. 1963), Alexei Ivanov, Andrei Rubanov (b. 1969), Oleg Pavlov (1970–2018), Andrei Ivanov (b. 1971), Roman Senchin (b. 1971), German Sadulaev, Zakhar Prilepin, and others).

The treasury of Russian poetry has been replenished with works by both senior masters, like Oleg Chukhontsev (b. 1938), and such debutants as Natalia Azarova (b. 1956), Vsevolod Emelin (b. 1959), Tatiana Grauz (b. 1964), Andrei Polyakov (b. 1968), Andrei Sen-Senkov (b. 1968), Tania Skarynkina (b. 1969), Igor Bulatovsky (b. 1971), Vlad Malenko (b. 1971), Andrei Rodionov (b. 1971), Anna Glazova (b. 1973), Victor Ivaniv (1977–2015), Eugenia Rits (b. 1977), Ekaterina Simonova (b. 1977), Pavel Goldin (b. 1978), Nika Skandiaka (b. 1978), Anna Zolotaryova (b. 1978), Roman Osminkin (b. 1979), Sergey Tenyatnikov (b. 1981), Vasily Borodin (1982–2021), Tatiana Moseeva (b. 1983), Alla Gorbunova (b. 1985), Vera Polozkova (b. 1986), Yevgenia Suslova (b. 1986), Nikita Ivanov (b. 1989), Galina Rymbu (b. 1990), Daria Serenko (b. 1993), and Maria Malinovskaya (b. 1994). The main trends of contemporary poetry are neo-surrealist fragmentation, as well as the return of plot poetry among representatives of the “New Epic” movement.

Two new literary prizes were established and became influential: the Big Book and the National Bestseller.

<text>Youssou N&#x27;Dour (, ; also known as Youssou Madjiguène Ndour; born 1 October 1959) is a Senegalese singer, songwriter, musician, composer, occasional actor, businessman, and politician. In 2004, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described him as, &quot;perhaps the most famous singer alive&quot; in Senegal and much of Africa and in 2023, the same publication ranked him at number 69 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time. From April 2012 to September 2013, he was Senegal&#x27;s Minister of Tourism.

N&#x27;Dour helped develop a style of popular Senegalese music known by all Senegambians (including the Wolof) as &quot;mbalax,&quot; a genre that has sacred origins in the Serer music njuup tradition and ndut initiation ceremonies. He is the subject of the award-winning films &quot;Return to Gorée&quot; (2007) directed by Pierre-Yves Borgeaud and &quot;Youssou N&#x27;Dour: I Bring What I Love&quot; (2008) directed by Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, which were released around the world.

In 2006, N&#x27;Dour was cast as Olaudah Equiano in the film &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;.

==Early life==
Ethnically, N&#x27;Dour is Serer, born to a Serer father and a Toucouleur mother. However, culturally, N&#x27;Dour is Wolof. He was born in Dakar. He started performing at age 12 and would later perform regularly with the Star Band, Dakar&#x27;s most popular group during the 1970s.

Despite N&#x27;Dour&#x27;s maternal connection to the traditional griot caste, he was not raised in that tradition, which he learned instead from his sibling. Although patrilineally from the noble N&#x27;Dour family, his parents&#x27; world-view encouraged a modern outlook, leaving him open to two cultures and thereby inspiring N&#x27;Dour&#x27;s identity as a modern griot. As a Mouride disciple&quot;, taalibé&quot; in Wolof, a Muslim of the Mouride brotherhood, one of the large four Sufi orders in Senegambia, he often incorporated aspects of Islamic music and chants into his work.

==Music career==
At the age of 15, Youssou N&#x27;Dour joined a band called Diamono and, in 1975, toured with the band in West Africa.

In 1976 when N&#x27;Dour was 16 years old, he signed a contract to sing with Ibra Kasse&#x27;s Star Band at Kasse&#x27;s Miami club in Dakar where he would become a sensation.

In 1978, N&#x27;Dour would follow as several members of the Star Band left to form Étoile de Dakar, a band that made important contributions to Senegal&#x27;s newly evolving musical style called mbalax which incorporated traditional Senegalese music into the Latin styles that had dominated Senegalese popular music. Although they quickly became one of the city&#x27;s most popular bands, the group was short-lived due to internal problems. Étoile de Dakar split into two groups: Étoile 2000 and Super Étoile de Dakar. The latter group included N&#x27;Dour, guitarist Jimi Mbaye, bassist Habib Faye, and tama (talking drum) player Assane Thiam. Super Étoile de Dakar produced four albums on cassette in just a few months and eventually evolved into N&#x27;Dour&#x27;s backing band.

By 1991, he had opened his own recording studio, and, by 1995, his own record label, Jololi.

N&#x27;Dour is one of the most celebrated African musicians in history. His mix of traditional Senegalese mbalax with eclectic influences ranging from Cuban rumba to hip hop, jazz, and soul has won him an international fan base of millions. In the West, N&#x27;Dour has collaborated with Peter Gabriel, Axelle Red, Sting, Alan Stivell, Bran Van 3000, Neneh Cherry, Wyclef Jean, Paul Simon, Bruce Springsteen, Tracy Chapman, James Newton Howard, Branford Marsalis, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Dido, Lou Reed, Bruce Cockburn, and others.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; described his voice as an &quot;arresting tenor, a supple weapon deployed with prophetic authority&quot;. N&#x27;Dour&#x27;s work absorbed the entire Senegalese musical spectrum, often filtered through the lens of genre-defying rock or pop music from outside Senegalese culture.

In July 1993, &quot;Africa Opera&quot; composed by N&#x27;Dour premiered at the Opéra Garnier for the French Festival Paris quartier d&#x27;été.

In 1994, N&#x27;Dour released his biggest international hit single, the trilingual &quot;7 Seconds&quot;, a duet sung with Neneh Cherry.

He wrote and performed the official anthem of the 1998 FIFA World Cup with Axelle Red &quot;La Cour des Grands (Do You Mind If I Play)&quot;.

&quot;Folk Roots&quot; magazine described him as the African Artist of the Century. He toured internationally for thirty years. He won his first American Grammy Award (best contemporary world music album) for his CD &quot;Egypt&quot; in 2005.

He is the proprietor of &quot;L&#x27;Observateur&quot;, one of the widest-circulation newspapers in Senegal, the radio station RFM (Radio Future Medias) and the TV channel TFM.

In 2002, N&#x27;Dour was honoured with a Prince Claus Award, under that year&#x27;s theme &quot;Languages and transcultural forms of expression&quot;.

In 2006, N&#x27;Dour played the role of the African-British abolitionist Olaudah Equiano in the movie &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, which chronicled the efforts of William Wilberforce to end slavery in the British Empire.

In 2008, N&#x27;Dour offered one of his compositions, &quot;Bébé&quot;, for the French singer Cynthia Brown.

In 2011, N&#x27;Dour was awarded an honorary doctoral degree in music from Yale University.

In 2013, N&#x27;Dour won a share of Sweden&#x27;s $150,000 Polar music prize for promoting understanding between faiths as well as for his music.

==Activism==
N&#x27;Dour was nominated as Goodwill Ambassador of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) on 16 October 2000.

In Senegal, N&#x27;Dour became a powerful cultural icon, actively involved in social issues. In 1985, he organized a concert for the release of Nelson Mandela. He was a featured performer in the 1988 worldwide Amnesty International Human Rights Now! Tour collaborating with Lou Reed on a version of the Peter Gabriel song &quot;Biko&quot; which was produced by Richard James Burgess and featured on the Amnesty International benefit album &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Third Ball&quot;. He worked with the United Nations and UNICEF, and he started Project Joko to open internet cafés in Africa and to connect Senegalese communities around the world.

In 2003, N&#x27;Dour cancelled an upcoming American tour in order to publicly deny support for the upcoming American invasion of Iraq. In a public statement explaining his decision, N&#x27;Dour said:It is my strong conviction that the responsibility for disarming Iraq should rest with the United Nations. As a matter of conscience I question the United States government&#x27;s apparent intention to commence war in Iraq. I believe that coming to America at this time would be perceived in many parts of the world--rightly or wrongly--as support for this policy, and that, as a consequence, it is inappropriate to perform in the US at this juncture.He performed in three of the Live 8 concerts (in Live 8 concert, London, Live 8 concert, Paris and at the Live 8 concert, Eden Project in Cornwall) on 2 July 2005, with Dido. He covered John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;Jealous Guy&quot; for the 2007 CD &quot;Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur&quot;. N&#x27;Dour appeared in a joint Spain-Senegal ad campaign to inform the African public about the dramatic consequences of illegal immigration. He participated in the Stock Exchange of Visions project in 2007.

In 2008, he joined the Fondation Chirac&#x27;s honour committee. The same year, Youssou N&#x27;Dour&#x27;s microfinance organization named Birima (&quot;Birima&quot; is also a song&#x27;s title) was launched with the collaboration of United Colors of Benetton.

In 2009, he released his song &quot;Wake Up (It&#x27;s Africa Calling)&quot; under a Creative Commons license to help IntraHealth International in their IntraHealth Open campaign to bring open source health applications to Africa. The song was remixed by a variety of artists including Nas, Peter Buck of R.E.M., and Duncan Sheik to help raise money for the campaign.

N&#x27;Dour is a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which advocates for democratic reformation of the United Nations.

==Political career==
At the beginning of 2012, he announced plans to stand as a candidate in the 2012 Senegalese presidential election, competing against President Abdoulaye Wade. However, he was disqualified from running in the election over the legitimacy of the signatures he had collected to endorse his campaign. N&#x27;Dour backed the opposition candidate Macky Sall, who defeated Wade in a second round of voting in March 2012. N&#x27;Dour was appointed as Minister of Culture and Tourism in April 2012 as part of the cabinet of new Prime Minister Abdoul Mbaye. The story of N&#x27;Dour&#x27;s presidential campaign was filmed for the PBS TV program &quot;Sound Tracks: Music Without Borders&quot;. Later his portfolio was modified and he was appointed as Minister of Tourism and Leisure. He was dismissed from that post on 2 September 2013, when a new government under Prime Minister Aminata Touré was appointed. N&#x27;Dour was instead appointed as Special Adviser to the President, with the rank of minister, and tasked with promoting the country abroad.

The KLIA Ekspres is an express airport rail link servicing the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) in Malaysia. It runs from KL Sentral, the main railway station of Kuala Lumpur to KLIA&#x27;s Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 stations. The line is one of the two services on the Express Rail Link (ERL) system, sharing the same tracks as the KLIA Transit. The KLIA Transit stops at all stations along the line, whereas the KLIA Ekspres runs as a direct non-stop express service between KL Sentral and KLIA Terminal 1 and 2. It is operated by Express Rail Link Sdn. Bhd. (ERL).

At KL Sentral, the two platforms of the ERL are accessed from different parts of the station building. The KLIA Ekspres side platforms are accessed from the KL City Air Terminal (KL CAT) while the KLIA Transit island platform is accessed from the main Transit Concourse at Level 1. At KLIA T1 and T2, both KLIA Ekspres and KLIA Transit share the same island platform for both north-bound and south-bound trains.

At KLIA T1 station, KLIA Ekspres uses the same platform for Terminal 2- or city-bound trains. Displays are installed at the platform to indicate the travelling direction of the approaching train.

Since the opening of the railway in 2002, the fleet consists of 12 4-car electric trainset from Siemens AG, Germany, on which 8 trainsets were allocated to KLIA Ekspres service.

This KLIA Ekspres trains has more seating than KLIA Transit trains for passenger comfort, and each train includes luggage racks beside the doors and overhead racks along the coach, along with Wi-Fi onboard. The trainset also includes VIP seatings for VIP service and toilets at the first car of the train. Luggage area for check-in flight luggages at KL City Air Terminal also included at the end cab on KL Sentral direction.

To increase frequency of the line, eight new 4-car electric trainset were brought from CRRC Changchun, in which two trainsets were allocated on KLIA Ekspres service. The trainset, nicknamed Equator, has much difference from the first generation train, in which the train lacks of toilets and luggage areas. The trainsets were arrived in October 2016, with commercial operation started in March 2017.

<text>Computational physics is the study and implementation of numerical analysis to solve problems in physics. Historically, computational physics was the first application of modern computers in science, and is now a subset of computational science. It is sometimes regarded as a subdiscipline (or offshoot) of theoretical physics, but others consider it an intermediate branch between theoretical and experimental physics — an area of study which supplements both theory and experiment.

== Overview ==

In physics, different theories based on mathematical models provide very precise predictions on how systems behave. Unfortunately, it is often the case that solving the mathematical model for a particular system in order to produce a useful prediction is not feasible. This can occur, for instance, when the solution does not have a closed-form expression, or is too complicated. In such cases, numerical approximations are required. Computational physics is the subject that deals with these numerical approximations: the approximation of the solution is written as a finite (and typically large) number of simple mathematical operations (algorithm), and a computer is used to perform these operations and compute an approximated solution and respective error.

===Status in physics===
There is a debate about the status of computation within the scientific method. Sometimes it is regarded as more akin to theoretical physics; some others regard computer simulation as &quot;computer experiments&quot;, yet still others consider it an intermediate or different branch between theoretical and experimental physics, a third way that supplements theory and experiment. While computers can be used in experiments for the measurement and recording (and storage) of data, this clearly does not constitute a computational approach.

==Challenges in computational physics==

Computational physics problems are in general very difficult to solve exactly. This is due to several (mathematical) reasons: lack of algebraic and/or analytic solvability, complexity, and chaos. For example, even apparently simple problems, such as calculating the wavefunction of an electron orbiting an atom in a strong electric field (Stark effect), may require great effort to formulate a practical algorithm (if one can be found); other cruder or brute-force techniques, such as graphical methods or root finding, may be required. On the more advanced side, mathematical perturbation theory is also sometimes used (a working is shown for this particular example here). In addition, the computational cost and computational complexity for many-body problems (and their classical counterparts) tend to grow quickly. A macroscopic system typically has a size of the order of formula_1 constituent particles, so it is somewhat of a problem. Solving quantum mechanical problems is generally of exponential order in the size of the system and for classical N-body it is of order N-squared. Finally, many physical systems are inherently nonlinear at best, and at worst chaotic: this means it can be difficult to ensure any numerical errors do not grow to the point of rendering the &#x27;solution&#x27; useless.

== Methods and algorithms ==
Because computational physics uses a broad class of problems, it is generally divided amongst the different mathematical problems it numerically solves, or the methods it applies. Between them, one can consider:

* root finding (using e.g. Newton-Raphson method)
* system of linear equations (using e.g. LU decomposition)
* ordinary differential equations (using e.g. Runge–Kutta methods)
* integration (using e.g. Romberg method and Monte Carlo integration)
* partial differential equations (using e.g. finite difference method and relaxation method)
* matrix eigenvalue problem (using e.g. Jacobi eigenvalue algorithm and power iteration)

All these methods (and several others) are used to calculate physical properties of the modeled systems.

Computational physics also borrows a number of ideas from computational chemistry - for example, the density functional theory used by computational solid state physicists to calculate properties of solids is basically the same as that used by chemists to calculate the properties of molecules.

Furthermore, computational physics encompasses the tuning of the software/hardware structure to solve the problems (as the problems usually can be very large, in processing power need or in memory requests).

== Divisions ==

It is possible to find a corresponding computational branch for every major field in physics:

* Computational mechanics consists of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), computational solid mechanics and computational contact mechanics.

* Computational electrodynamics is the process of modeling the interaction of electromagnetic fields with physical objects and the environment. One subfield at the confluence between CFD and electromagnetic modelling is computational magnetohydrodynamics.

* Computational chemistry is a rapidly growing field that was developed due to the quantum many-body problem.

* Computational solid state physics is a very important division of computational physics dealing directly with material science.

* Computational statistical mechanics is a field related to computational condensed matter which deals with the simulation of models and theories (such as percolation and spin models) that are difficult to solve otherwise.

* Computational statistical physics makes heavy use of Monte Carlo-like methods. More broadly, (particularly through the use of agent based modeling and cellular automata) it also concerns itself with (and finds application in, through the use of its techniques) in the social sciences, network theory, and mathematical models for the propagation of disease (most notably, the SIR Model) and the spread of forest fires.

* Numerical relativity is a (relatively) new field interested in finding numerical solutions to the field equations of both special relativity and general relativity.

* Computational particle physics deals with problems motivated by particle physics.

* Computational astrophysics is the application of these techniques and methods to astrophysical problems and phenomena.

* Computational biophysics is a branch of biophysics and computational biology itself, applying methods of computer science and physics to large complex biological problems.

== Applications ==
Due to the broad class of problems computational physics deals, it is an essential component of modern research in different areas of physics, namely: accelerator physics, astrophysics, general theory of relativity (through numerical relativity), fluid mechanics (computational fluid dynamics), lattice field theory/lattice gauge theory (especially lattice quantum chromodynamics), plasma physics (see plasma modeling), simulating physical systems (using e.g. molecular dynamics), nuclear engineering computer codes, protein structure prediction, weather prediction, solid state physics, soft condensed matter physics, hypervelocity impact physics etc.

Computational solid state physics, for example, uses density functional theory to calculate properties of solids, a method similar to that used by chemists to study molecules. Other quantities of interest in solid state physics, such as the electronic band structure, magnetic properties and charge densities can be calculated by this and several methods, including the Luttinger-Kohn/k.p method and ab-initio methods.

On top of advanced physics software, there are also a myriad of tools of analytics available for beginning students of physics such as the PASCO Capstone software.

<text>Waverly is a town in Chambers and Lee counties in the U.S. state of Alabama. It is part of the Auburn Metropolitan Area. It was incorporated in 1910. As of 2010, the town population was 145.

Waverly has an operating United States post office; four churches are located in the town.

==History==
Waverly was settled in the 1830s, but saw little growth until the 1870s. The name of Waverly, Alabama first appeared on Alabama maps in 1853 (see reference below). It was given the nickname, Pea Ridge, but this was never its official name.

==Annual Town Bar-B-Q==
Beginning October 1990, and the second Saturday of each October since, the Town of Waverly hosts the Annual Waverly BBQ. Both pork and chicken BBQ, home made cakes and other sweets, cols, ice tea and lemonade are served. Town members all pitch in cooking, preparing the food,&#x27;stirring&#x27; the stew pot (a local tradition), and smoking the BBQ with hickory wood from the Friday night prior to the &#x27;BBQ Day&#x27; at approximately 5:00pm, and continue this tradition until all the BBQ and stew is sold. Food is served to all attendees from 10:00am until 3:00pm. The event hosts singers, dancers, artists, arts and crafts, petting zoos, and other such events. This town get together serves as one of Waverly&#x27;s largest fundraising events.

==The Old 280 Boogie ==

In 2000, the State of Alabama rerouted U.S. Highway 280 south of the town of Waverly instead of routing it through town. This decision meant the town was saved from destruction. To celebrate, residents in 2001 decided to hold an annual &quot;Waverly Boogie&quot; (or &quot;Old 280 Boogie&quot;), a multi-cultural festival typically held on the third Saturday in April. The event, featuring a wide variety of musicians and visual artists, is held in an open-air amphitheater.

The 2014 event was held on April 19, 2014; a Fall Boogie was held on September 13. Additionally, in 2014, Standard Deluxe hosted its first annual Heart of Waverly Bluegrass Festival.

==Geography==
Waverly is in the southwest corner of Chambers County at 32°44&#x27;8.369&quot; North, 85°34&#x27;27.736&quot; West (32.735658, −85.574371). The town limits extend south into Lee County. According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which , or 0.68%, is water.

U.S. Route 280 runs southwest of downtown, leading southeast 14 mi (23 km) to Opelika and northwest 13 mi (21 km) to Dadeville.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 184 people, 76 households and 50 families living in the town. The population density was . There were 87 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the town was 80.98% White and 19.02% Black or African American.

The average household size was 2.42 and the average family size was 3.12.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 24.5% under the age of 18, 7.6% from 18 to 24, 31.5% from 25 to 44, 20.1% from 45 to 64, and 16.3% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females, there were 102.2 males. For every 100 females age 18 and older, there were 95.8 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $32,917, and the median income for a family was $38,750. Males had a median income of $26,625 while it was $16,071 for females. The per-capita income for the town was $18,406. About 3.7% of families and 7.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including none of those younger than 18 or 65 or older.

<text>In computing, a library is a collection of resources that is leveraged during software development to implement a computer program. Commonly, a library consists of executable code such as compiled functions and classes, or a library can be a collection of source code. A resource library may contain data such as images and text.

A library can be used by multiple, independent consumers (programs and other libraries). This differs from resources defined in a program which can usually only be used by that program. When a consumer uses a library resource, it gains the value of the library without having to implement it itself. Libraries encourage software reuse in a modular fashion. Libraries can use other libraries resulting in a hierarchy of libraries in a program.

When writing code that uses a library, a programmer only needs to know how to use it not its the internal details. For example, a program could use a library that abstracts a complicated system call so that the programmer can use the system feature without spending time to learn the intricacies of the system function.

== History ==

The idea of a computer library dates back to the first computers created by Charles Babbage. An 1888 paper on his Analytical Engine suggested that computer operations could be punched on separate cards from numerical input. If these operation punch cards were saved for reuse then &quot;by degrees the engine would have a library of its own.&quot;

In 1947 Goldstine and von Neumann speculated that it would be useful to create a &quot;library&quot; of subroutines for their work on the IAS machine, an early computer that was not yet operational at that time. They envisioned a physical library of magnetic wire recordings, with each wire storing reusable computer code.

Inspired by von Neumann, Wilkes and his team constructed EDSAC. A filing cabinet of punched tape held the subroutine library for this computer. Programs for EDSAC consisted of a main program and a sequence of subroutines copied from the subroutine library. In 1951 the team published the first textbook on programming, &quot;The Preparation of Programs for an Electronic Digital Computer&quot;, which detailed the creation and the purpose of the library.

COBOL included &quot;primitive capabilities for a library system&quot; in 1959, but Jean Sammet described them as &quot;inadequate library facilities&quot; in retrospect.

JOVIAL has a Communication Pool (COMPOOL), roughly a library of header files.

Another major contributor to the modern library concept came in the form of the subprogram innovation of FORTRAN. FORTRAN subprograms can be compiled independently of each other, but the compiler lacked a linker. So prior to the introduction of modules in Fortran-90, type checking between FORTRAN subprograms was impossible.

By the mid 1960s, copy and macro libraries for assemblers were common. Starting with the popularity of the IBM System/360, libraries containing other types of text elements, e.g., system parameters, also became common.

In IBM&#x27;s OS/360 and its successors this is called a partitioned data set.

The first object-oriented programming language, Simula, developed in 1965, supported adding classes to libraries via its compiler.

==Linking==
The &quot;linking&quot; (or &quot;binding&quot;) process resolves references known as &quot;symbols&quot; (or &quot;links&quot;) by searching for them in various locations including configured libraries. If a linker (or binder) does not find a symbol, then it fails, but multiple matches may or may not cause failure.

&quot;Static linking&quot; is linking at build time, such that the library executable code is included in the program. &quot;Dynamic linking&quot; is linking at run time; it involves building the program with information that supports run-time linking to a dynamic link library (DLL). For dynamic linking, a compatible DLL file must be available to the program at run time, but for static linking, the program is standalone.

&quot;Smart linking&quot; is performed by a build tool that excludes unused code in the linking process. For example, a program that only uses integers for arithmetic, or does no arithmetic operations at all, can exclude floating-point library routines. This can lead to smaller program file size and reduced memory usage.

==Relocation==
Some references in a program or library module are stored in a relative or symbolic form which cannot be resolved until all code and libraries are assigned final static addresses. Relocation is the process of adjusting these references, and is done either by the linker or the loader. In general, relocation cannot be done to individual libraries themselves because the addresses in memory may vary depending on the program using them and other libraries they are combined with. Position-independent code avoids references to absolute addresses and therefore does not require relocation.

== Categories ==

=== Executable ===

An executable library consists of code that has been converted from source code into machine code or an intermediate form such as bytecode. A linker allows for using library objects by associating each reference with an address at which the object is located. For example, in C, a library function is invoked via C&#x27;s normal function call syntax and semantics.

A variant is a library containing compiled code (object code in IBM&#x27;s nomenclature) in a form that cannot be loaded by the OS but that can be read by the linker.

===Static===
A static library is an executable library that is linked into a program at build-time by a linker (or whatever the build tool is called that does linking). This process, and the resulting stand-alone file, is known as a static build of the program. A static build may not need any further relocation if virtual memory is used and no address space layout randomization is desired.

A static library is sometimes called an &quot;archive&quot; on Unix-like systems.

===Dynamic===

A dynamic library is linked when the program is run either at load-time or runtime. The dynamic library was intended after the static library to support additional software deployment flexibility.

===Source===
A source library consists of source code; not compiled code. 

===Shared===
A shared library is a library that contains executable code designed to be used by multiple computer programs or other libraries at runtime, with only one copy of that code in memory, shared by all programs using the code.

===Object===

Although generally an obsolete technology today, an object library exposes resources for object-oriented programming (OOP) and a distributed object is a remote object library. Examples include: COM/DCOM, SOM/DSOM, DOE, PDO and various CORBA-based systems.

The object library technology was developed since as OOP became popular, it became apparent that OOP runtime binding required information than contemporary libraries did not provide. In addition to the names and entry points of the code located within, due to inheritance, OOP binding also requires a list of dependencies since the full definition of a method may be in different places. Further, this requires more than listing that one library requires the services of another. In OOP, the libraries themselves may not be known at compile time, and vary from system to system.

The remote object technology was developed in parallel to support multi-tier programs with a user interface application running on a personal computer (PC) using services of a mainframe or minicomputer such as data storage and processing. For instance, a program on a PC would send messages to a minicomputer via remote procedure call (RPC) to retrieve relatively small samples from a relatively large dataset. In response, distrubuted object technology was developed.

===Class===

A class library contains classes that can be used to create objects. In Java, for example, classes are contained in JAR files and objects are created at runtime from the classes. However, in Smalltalk, a class library is the starting point for a system image that includes the entire state of the environment, classes and all instantiated objects. Most class libraries are stored in a package repository (such as Maven Central for Java). Client code explicitly specifies dependencies to external libraries in build configuration files (such as a Maven Pom in Java).

===Remote===
A remote library runs on another computer and its assets are accessed via remote procedure call (RPC) over a network. This distributed architecture allows for minimizing installation of the library and support for it on each consuming system and ensuring consistent versioning. A significant downside is that each library call entails significantly more overhead than for a local library.

=== Runtime ===
A runtime library provides access to the runtime environment that is available to a program tailored to the host platform.

=== Language standard ===
Many modern programming languages specify a standard library that provides a base level of functionality for the language environment.

===Code generation===
A code generation library has a high-level API generating or transforming byte code for Java. They are used by aspect-oriented programming, some data access frameworks, and for testing to generate dynamic proxy objects. They also are used to intercept field access.

==File naming==
===Unix-like===
On most modern Unix-like systems, library files are stored in directories such as codice_1, codice_2 and codice_3. A filename typically starts with codice_4, and ends with codice_5 for a static library (archive) or codice_6 for a shared object (dynamically linked library). For example, codice_7 and codice_8.

Often, symbolic link files are used to manage versioning of a library by providing a link file named without a version that links to a file named with a version. For example, codice_9 might be version 2 of library &quot;foo&quot; and a link file named codice_8 provides a version independent name to that file that programs link to. The link file could be changed to a refer to a version 3 (codice_11) such that consuming programs will then use version 3 without having to change the program.

Files with extension codice_12 are libtool archives; not usable by the system.

===macOS===
The macOS system inherits static library conventions from BSD, with the library stored in a codice_5 file. It uses either codice_6 or codice_15 for dynamic libraries. Most libraries in macOS, however, consist of &quot;frameworks&quot;, placed inside special directories called &quot;bundles&quot; which wrap the library&#x27;s required files and metadata. For example, a framework called codice_16 would be implemented in a bundle called codice_17, with codice_18 being either the dynamically linked library file or a symlink to the dynamically linked library file in codice_19.

===Windows===
Often, a Windows dynamic-link library (DLL) has the file extension codice_20, although sometimes different extensions are used to indicate general content, e.g. codice_21 for a OLE library. 

A codice_22 file can be either a static library or contain the information needed to build an application that consumes the associated DLL. In the latter case, the associated DLL file must be present at runtime.

<text>Streaky the Supercat is a fictional superhero cat that appears in comic books published by DC Comics. He first appeared in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #261 (February 1960) and was created by Jerry Siegel and Jim Mooney.

He is Supergirl&#x27;s pet cat who gained superpowers through exposure to X-Kryptonite; such as flight, super-strength, super-speed, invulnerability, and enhanced vision abilities, among other Kryptonian powers. His distinctive mark is a lightning bolt in his fur running along both sides. He is also a member of the Legion of Super-Pets, alongside other super-powered animals such as Krypto, Beppo, and Comet.

==Publication history==
Streaky the Supercat first appeared in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #261 (February 1960) and was created by writer Jerry Siegel and artist Jim Mooney. He was the pet of Supergirl, in her identity as Linda Lee.

==Fictional character biography==
Streaky is Supergirl&#x27;s pet cat who gains superpowers from a variety of kryptonite she created while attempting to neutralize its effects. He was one of several superpowered animal characters created during the Silver Age of Comic Books.

Streaky made sporadic appearances in comics through the 1960s and joined the Legion of Super-Pets, a group consisting of the aforementioned super-powered animals.

In &quot;The Sandman Saga&quot;, Streaky loses his powers after all kryptonite is transformed into iron. Following the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; reboot, various characters inspired by Streaky appear before the original Streaky is reintroduced in &quot;Super Sons Annual&quot; (2017).

<text>North Korea has a military nuclear weapons program and, as of 2024, is estimated to have an arsenal of approximately 50 nuclear weapons and sufficient production of fissile material for six to seven nuclear weapons per year. North Korea has also stockpiled a significant quantity of chemical and biological weapons. In 2003, North Korea withdrew from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Since 2006, the country has conducted six nuclear tests at increasing levels of expertise, prompting the imposition of sanctions.

== History ==

North Korea showed an interest in developing nuclear weapons as early as the 1950s. The nuclear program can be traced back to about 1962, when North Korea committed itself to what it called &quot;all-fortressization&quot;, which was the beginning of the hyper-militarized North Korea of today. In 1963, North Korea asked the Soviet Union for help in developing nuclear weapons, but was refused. The Soviet Union agreed to help North Korea develop a peaceful nuclear energy program, including the training of nuclear scientists. Later, China, after its nuclear tests, similarly rejected North Korean requests for help with developing nuclear weapons.

Soviet engineers took part in the construction of the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center and began construction of an IRT-2000 research reactor in 1963, which became operational in 1965 and was upgraded to 8 MW in 1974. In 1979, North Korea began to build a second research reactor in Yongbyon, as well as an ore processing plant and a fuel rod fabrication plant.

In 1985 North Korea ratified the NPT but did not include the required safeguards agreement with the IAEA until 1992. In early 1993, while verifying North Korea&#x27;s initial declaration, the IAEA concluded that there was strong evidence this declaration was incomplete. When North Korea refused the requested special inspection, the IAEA reported its noncompliance to the UN Security Council. In 1993, North Korea announced its withdrawal from the NPT, but suspended that withdrawal before it took effect.

Under the 1994 Agreed Framework, the U.S. government agreed to facilitate the supply of two light water reactors to North Korea in exchange for North Korean disarmament. Such reactors are considered &quot;more proliferation-resistant than North Korea&#x27;s graphite-moderated reactors&quot;, but not &quot;proliferation proof&quot;. The Agreed Framework was undermined by a Republican Congress during Clinton&#x27;s presidency, as Congress denounced the agreement with North Korea, imposed new sanctions on North Korea, and hindered the Clinton administration from providing the supplies to North Korea that were part of the Agreed Framework. Implementation of the Agreed Framework foundered, and in 2002 the Agreed Framework fell apart, with each side blaming the other for its failure. By 2002, Pakistan had admitted that North Korea had gained access to Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear technology in the late 1990s.

Based on evidence from Pakistan, Libya, and multiple statements made by the DPRK government, the United States accused North Korea of noncompliance and halted oil shipments; North Korea later claimed its public confession of guilt had been deliberately misconstrued. By the end of 2002, the Agreed Framework was officially abandoned.

In 2003, North Korea again announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. In 2005, it admitted to having nuclear weapons but vowed to close the nuclear program.

On October 9, 2006, North Korea announced it had successfully conducted its first nuclear test. An underground nuclear explosion was detected, its yield was estimated as less than a kiloton, and some radioactive output was detected. On January 6, 2007, the North Korean government further confirmed that it had nuclear weapons.

On March 17, 2007, North Korea told delegates at international nuclear talks that it was preparing to shut down its main nuclear facility. The agreement was reached following a series of six-party talks, involving North Korea, South Korea, China, Russia, Japan, and the United States begun in 2003. According to the agreement, a list of its nuclear programs would be submitted and the nuclear facility would be disabled in exchange for fuel aid and normalization talks with the United States and Japan. This was delayed from April due to a dispute with the United States over Banco Delta Asia, but on July 14, International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors confirmed the shutdown of North Korea&#x27;s Yongbyon nuclear reactor and consequently North Korea began to receive aid. This agreement fell apart in 2009, following a North Korean satellite launch.

In April 2009, reports surfaced that North Korea has become a &quot;fully fledged nuclear power&quot;, an opinion shared by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director General Mohamed ElBaradei. On May 25, 2009, North Korea conducted a second nuclear test, resulting in an explosion estimated to be between 2 and 7 kilotons. The 2009 test, like the 2006 test, is believed to have occurred at Mantapsan, Kilju County, in the north-eastern part of North Korea. This was found by an earthquake occurring at the test site.

In February 2012, North Korea announced that it would suspend uranium enrichment at the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center and not conduct any further tests of nuclear weapons while productive negotiations involving the United States continue. This agreement included a moratorium on long-range missile tests. Additionally, North Korea agreed to allow IAEA inspectors to monitor operations at Yongbyon. The United States reaffirmed that it had no hostile intent toward the DPRK and was prepared to improve bilateral relationships, and agreed to ship humanitarian food aid to North Korea. The United States called the move &quot;important, if limited&quot;, but said it would proceed cautiously and that talks would resume only after North Korea made steps toward fulfilling its promise. However, after North Korea conducted a long-range missile test in April 2012, the United States decided not to proceed with the food aid.

On February 11, 2013, the U.S. Geological Survey detected a magnitude 5.1 seismic disturbance, reported to be a third underground nuclear test. North Korea has officially reported it as a successful nuclear test with a lighter warhead that delivers more force than before but has not revealed the exact yield. Multiple South Korean sources estimated the yield was 6–9 kilotons, while the German Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources estimated the yield to have been 40 kilotons. However, the German estimate has since been revised to a yield equivalent of 14 kt when they published their estimations in January 2016.

On January 6, 2016, in Korea, the United States Geological Survey detected a magnitude 5.1 seismic disturbance, reported to be a fourth underground nuclear test. North Korea claimed that this test involved a hydrogen bomb. This claim has not been verified. A &quot;hydrogen bomb&quot; could refer to several stages of fusion development, ranging from boosted fission devices to true thermonuclear weapons.

Within hours, many nations and organizations had condemned the test. Expert U.S. analysts do not believe that a hydrogen bomb was detonated. Seismic data collected so far suggests a 6–9 kiloton yield and that magnitude is not consistent with the power that would be generated by a hydrogen bomb explosion. &quot;What we&#x27;re speculating is they tried to do a boosted nuclear device, which is an atomic bomb that has a little bit of hydrogen, an isotope in it called tritium,&quot; said Joseph Cirincione, president of the global security firm Ploughshares Fund. The German source which estimates for all the North Korea&#x27;s past nuclear test has instead made an initial estimation of 14 kt, which is about the same (revised) yield as its previous nuclear test in 2013. However, the yield estimation for January 2016 nuclear test was revised to 10 kt in the subsequent nuclear test from North Korea.

On February 7, 2016, roughly a month after the alleged hydrogen bomb test, North Korea claimed to have put a satellite into orbit around the Earth. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe had warned North Korea to not launch the rocket, and if it did and the rocket violated Japanese territory, it would be shot down. Nevertheless, North Korea launched the rocket, leading the United States, Japan, and South Korea to criticize the launch. Despite North Korean claims that the rocket was for peaceful, scientific purposes, it has been heavily criticized as an attempt to perform an ICBM test under the guise of a satellite launch. China also criticized the launch, however urged &quot;the relevant parties&quot; to &quot;refrain from taking actions that may further escalate tensions on the Korean peninsula&quot;.

A fifth nuclear test occurred on September 9, 2016. This test yield is considered the highest among all five tests thus far, surpassing its previous record in 2013. The South Korean government said that the yield was about 10 kt despite other sources suggesting a yield. The same German source which has made estimation of all North Korea&#x27;s previous nuclear tests suggested an estimation of a 25 kiloton yield.

Other nations and the United Nations have responded to North Korea&#x27;s ongoing missile and nuclear development with a variety of sanctions; on March 2, 2016, the UN Security Council voted to impose additional sanctions against North Korea.

In 2017, North Korea test-launched two ICBMs, the second of which had sufficient range to reach the continental United States. In September 2017, the country announced a further &quot;perfect&quot; hydrogen bomb test.

Until 2022, North Korea&#x27;s stated policy position was that nuclear weapons &quot;will never be abused or used as a means for preemptive strike&quot;, but if there is an &quot;attempt to have recourse to military force against us&quot; North Korea may use their &quot;most powerful offensive strength in advance to punish them&quot;. This was not a full no first use policy. This policy changed in 2022 with a law approved by the Supreme People&#x27;s Assembly, which states that in the case of an attack against the top leadership or the nuclear command and control system, nuclear attacks against the enemy would be launched automatically. Additionally, the new law indicates that if Kim Jong Un was killed, the authorization of nuclear strikes would pass to a senior official.

Since 2023, North Korea has taken a more transparent approach to its nuclear activities, signaling an expansion of its nuclear program. Leader Kim Jong Un unveiled facilities involved in weapons production, including centrifuge halls and small reactors, emphasizing plans to deploy large numbers of tactical nuclear weapons. North Korea is estimated to possess enough material for up to 90 warheads and has reportedly assembled around 50 nuclear weapons. These revelations have heightened international concerns over North Korea&#x27;s capabilities and the potential threat to the U.S. mainland and its allies.

== Nuclear weapons ==
=== Overview ===

The Korean Central News Agency claims that the &quot;U.S. has long posed nuclear threats to the DPRK&quot; and &quot;the U.S. was seized by a foolish ambition to bring down the DPRK&quot;, so it &quot;needed a countermeasure&quot;. North Korea has been suspected of maintaining a clandestine nuclear weapons development program since the early 1980s, when it constructed a plutonium-producing Magnox nuclear reactor at Yongbyon. Various diplomatic means have been used by the international community to attempt to limit North Korea&#x27;s nuclear program to peaceful power generation and to encourage North Korea to participate in international treaties.
In May 1992, the International Atomic Energy Agency&#x27;s (IAEA) first inspection in North Korea uncovered discrepancies suggesting that the country had reprocessed more plutonium than declared. IAEA requested access to additional information and access to two nuclear waste sites at Yongbyon. North Korea rejected the IAEA request and announced on March 12, 1993, an intention to withdraw from the NPT.

In 1994, North Korea pledged, under the Agreed Framework with the United States, to freeze its plutonium programs and dismantle all its nuclear weapons programs in return for the normalization of diplomatic relations and several kinds of assistance, including resources for alternative energy supplies.

By 2002, the United States believed North Korea was pursuing both uranium enrichment technology and plutonium reprocessing technologies in defiance of the Agreed Framework. North Korea reportedly told American diplomats in private that they were in possession of nuclear weapons, citing American failures to uphold their own end of the Agreed Framework as a motivating force. North Korea later &quot;clarified&quot; that it did not possess weapons yet, but that it had &quot;a right&quot; to possess them, despite the Agreed Framework. In late 2002 and early 2003, North Korea began to take steps to eject International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors while re-routing spent fuel rods to be used for plutonium reprocessing for weapons purposes. As late as the end of 2003, North Korea claimed that it would freeze its nuclear program in exchange for additional American concessions, but a final agreement was not reached. North Korea withdrew from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 2003.

==== 2006 ====

On October 9, 2006, North Korea demonstrated its nuclear capabilities with its first underground nuclear test, detonating a plutonium-based device with an estimated yield of 0.2–1 kilotons. The test was conducted at Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site in North Hamgyong Province, and U.S. intelligence officials later announced that analysis of radioactive debris in air samples collected a few days after the test confirmed that the blast had taken place. The UN Security Council condemned the test and announced the imposition of Resolution 1718.

==== Aftermath of 2006 nuclear test ====
On January 6, 2007, the North Korean government further confirmed that it had nuclear weapons.

In February 2007, following the six-party talks disarmament process, Pyongyang agreed to shut down its main nuclear reactor. On October 8, 2008, IAEA inspectors were forbidden by the North Korean government to conduct further inspections of the site.

==== 2009 ====

On April 25, 2009, the North Korean government announced the country&#x27;s nuclear facilities had been reactivated, and that spent fuel reprocessing for arms-grade plutonium had been restored.

On May 25, 2009, North Korea conducted its second underground nuclear test. The U.S. Geological Survey calculated its origin in proximity of the site of the first nuclear test. The test, estimated at 2 to 7 kilotons, was more powerful than the previous test. The same day, a successful short-range missile test was also conducted.

==== 2010 ====
In May 2010, the North Korean government claimed to have successfully performed nuclear fusion. Although the claim was largely dismissed at the time, a 2012 analysis of radioisotopes suggested that North Korea may have performed two nuclear tests involving fusion. The paper was met with skepticism, as subsequent analysis of seismic data suggested no tests took place. In 2014, a study using seismic data found evidence for nuclear testing but a 2016 study once again dismissed claims of nuclear testing, suggesting that the seismic data was indicative of a minor earthquake.

==== 2013 ====
On February 12, monitors in Asia picked up unusual seismic activity at a North Korean facility at 11:57 (02:57 GMT), later determined to be an artificial quake with an initial magnitude 4.9 (later revised to 5.1). In The Korean Central News Agency subsequently said that the country had detonated a miniaturized nuclear device with &quot;greater explosive force&quot; in an underground test. According to the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources, the estimated yield was 7.7–7.8 kilotons. Other researchers estimate the yield to have been 12.2 ± 3.8 kilotons.

==== December 2015 hydrogen bomb claim ====
In December 2015, Kim Jong Un suggested that the country had the capacity to launch a hydrogen bomb, a device of considerably more power than conventional atomic bombs used in previous tests. The remark was met with skepticism from the White House and from South Korean officials.

==== 2016 ====

===== First claimed North Korean hydrogen bomb test =====

On January 7, after reports of a magnitude 5.1 earthquake originating in northeast North Korea at 10:00:01 UTC+08:30, the country&#x27;s regime released statements that it had successfully tested a hydrogen bomb. Whether this was in fact a hydrogen bomb has yet to be proven. Experts have cast doubt on this claim. A South Korean spy expert suggested that it may have been an atomic bomb and not a hydrogen bomb. Experts in several countries, including South Korea have expressed doubts about the claimed technology because of the relatively small size of the explosion. Senior Defense Analyst Bruce W. Bennett of research organization RAND told the BBC that &quot;Kim Jong-un is either lying, saying they did a hydrogen test when they didn&#x27;t, they just used a little bit more efficient fission weapon – or the hydrogen part of the test really didn&#x27;t work very well or the fission part didn&#x27;t work very well.&quot;

===== Aftermath of claimed North Korean hydrogen bomb test =====

On March 9, 2016, North Korea released a video of Kim Jong Un visiting a missile factory. The international community was skeptical, IHS Jane&#x27;s Karl Dewey said that &quot;It is possible that the silver sphere is a simple atomic bomb. But it is not a hydrogen bomb.&quot; Furthermore, he said &quot;a hydrogen bomb would not only be in two parts but also be a different shape&quot;.

Nations across the world, as well as NATO and the UN, spoke out against the tests as destabilizing, as a danger to international security and as a breach of UN Security Council resolutions. China, one of North Korea&#x27;s allies, also denounced the test.

===== First nuclear warhead test explosion =====

On September 9, 2016, a 5.3 seismic tremor was detected by seismographs in surrounding countries, after which North Korea confirmed it conducted another nuclear test. North Korea stated that this test has enabled them to confirm that its warhead can be mounted to a missile and to verify the warhead&#x27;s power. It was previously doubted that North Korea could pair the nuclear warhead and missile together, but South Korean experts started to believe that North Korea can accomplish this goal within a few years after the September 9 nuclear test.

==== 2017 ====

On February 18, 2017, China announced that it was suspending all imports of coal from North Korea as part of its effort to enact United Nations Security Council sanctions aimed at stopping the country&#x27;s nuclear weapons and ballistic-missile program.
On March 6, 2017, North Korea launched four ballistic missiles from the Tongchang-ri region towards the Sea of Japan. The launch was condemned by the United Nations as well as South Korea. The move prompted US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to embark on a diplomatic mission ten days later to Japan, South Korea and China, in an effort to address the heightened international tension in the region. On April 13, 2017, White House representative Nick Rivero was quoted saying the United States was &quot;very close&quot; to engaging in some sort of retaliation towards North Korea. President Trump commented on North Korea by saying they will fight the war on terrorism no matter the cost.

On April 15, 2017, at the yearly major public holiday also known in the country as the Day of the Sun, North Korea staged a massive military parade to commemorate the 105th birth anniversary of Kim Il Sung, the country&#x27;s founder and grandfather of current leader, Kim Jong Un. The parade took place amid hot speculation in the United States, Japan, and South Korea that the country would also potentially test a sixth nuclear device, but failed to do so. The parade did publicly display, for the first time, two new intercontinental ballistic missile-sized canisters as well as submarine-launched ballistic missiles and a land-based version of the same.

On April 16, 2017, hours after the military parade in Pyongyang, North Korea attempted to launch a ballistic missile from a site near the port of Sinpo, on the country&#x27;s east coast. The missile exploded seconds after launch.

Later that month, after a visit to Washington by the top Chinese leader, the US State Department announced that North Korea was likely to face economic sanctions from China if it conducted any further tests.

On April 28, 2017, North Korea launched an unidentified ballistic missile over Pukchang airfield, in North Korean territory. It blew up shortly after take-off at an altitude of approximately 70 km (44 mi).

On July 4, 2017, North Korea launched Hwasong-14 from Banghyon airfield, near Kusong, in a lofted trajectory it claims lasted 39 minutes for 930 km (578 mi), landing in the waters of the Japanese exclusive economic zone. US Pacific Command said the missile was aloft for 37 minutes, meaning that in a standard trajectory it could have reached all of Alaska, a distance of 6,690 km (4,160 mi).
By targeting the deep waters in the Sea of Japan, North Korea was ensuring that American or Japanese divers would encounter difficulties when attempting to recover Hwasong-14&#x27;s engine. Equally, North Korea was not attempting to recover any re-entry debris either, which South Korea pointed out is an indication that this first launch was of an ICBM which was far from ready for combat. As of July 2017, the U.S. estimated that North Korea would have a reliable nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) by early 2018. On July 28, North Korea launched a second, apparently more advanced, ICBM, with altitude around 3,700 km (2,300 mi), that traveled 1,000 km (620 mi) down range; analysts estimated that it was capable of reaching the continental United States.

Aerospace engineer and weapons analyst Dr. John Schilling estimates the current accuracy of the North&#x27;s Hwasong-14 as poor, at the mooted ranges which threaten US cities. Michael Elleman points out that July 28, 2017 missile re-entry vehicle broke up on re-entry; further testing would be required.
On August 8, 2017 &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the Defense Intelligence Agency, in a confidential assessment, stated that North Korea has sufficiently miniaturized a nuclear warhead to fit inside one of its long-range missiles. On August 12 &quot;The Diplomat&quot; reported that the Central Intelligence Agency, in a confidential assessment from early August, has concluded that the reentry vehicle in the July 28 test of Hwasong-14 did not survive atmospheric reentry due to apogee of 3,700 kilometers which caused structural stresses in excess of what an ICBM would have had in minimum energy trajectory. The CIA also concluded that North Korean reentry vehicle is likely advanced enough that it would likely survive reentry under normal minimum energy trajectory.

On September 3, 2017, North Korea claimed to have successfully tested a thermonuclear bomb, also known as a hydrogen bomb. Corresponding seismic activity similar to an earthquake of magnitude 6.3 was reported by the USGS, making the blast around 10 times more powerful than previous detonations by the country. Later the bomb yield was estimated to be 250 kilotons, based on further study of the seismic data. The test was reported to be &quot;a perfect success&quot; by North Korean authorities.

Jane&#x27;s Information Group estimates the explosive payload of the North Korean thermonuclear/hydrogen Teller-Ulam type bomb to weigh between .

On November 20, 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump announced that North Korea was re-listed by the State Department as a state sponsor of terrorism. Japan and South Korea welcomed the move as a method of increasing pressure on North Korea to negotiate about denuclearization.

On November 28, 2017, North Korea fired an intercontinental ballistic missile in the first such launch from the country in more than two months. The missile, believed by the U.S. military to be an ICBM, was launched from Sain Ni and flew roughly 1,000 km (620 mi) before landing in the Sea of Japan.

After North Korea claimed that the missile was capable of &quot;carrying [a] super-heavy [nuclear] warhead and hitting the whole mainland of the U.S.&quot;, Kim-Jong-Un announced that they had &quot;finally realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force&quot;, putting them in a position of strength to push the United States into talks.

==== 2019 ====

In August 2019, Japan has upgraded its estimate of North Korea&#x27;s nuclear weapons capability in an upcoming annual Defence White Paper, saying it seems Pyongyang has achieved the miniaturization of warheads. The defence report will maintain Japan&#x27;s contention that North Korea&#x27;s nuclear and ballistic missile programs pose a &quot;serious and imminent threat&quot; to its security after recent meetings between Donald Trump and the North&#x27;s leader, Kim Jong Un, failed to make progress on denuclearisation.

==== 2020 ====
Bruce Klingner of the U.S.-based Heritage Foundation estimated, in June 2020, that North Korea has likely built &quot;eight or more additional nuclear weapons&quot; since the 2018 summit.

On October 10, 2020, North Korea unveiled a massive ICBM during a military parade for the 75th anniversary of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea, with CNN reporting that military analysts believe it is one of the world&#x27;s largest road-mobile ballistic missiles.

==== 2022 ====
In the first 4 weeks of 2022, North Korea conducted 7 missile tests. Missiles tested included a hypersonic glide vehicle, an intermediate range ballistic missile (IRBM) and various cruise missiles.

On September 9, 2022, North Korea passed a law to declare itself a nuclear weapons state and rejected any possibility of denuclearisation.

==== 2023 ====

On March 24, 2023, North Korea unveiled the tactical nuclear bomb with at least 10 warheads shown with an estimated diameter from 40 to 50 centimeters as reported by the South Korean media. Hwasong-11A (KN-23) and KN-25 ballistic missiles are capable of carrying it. In December 2023, North Korea launched an ICBM (a Hwasong-18) in a test fire which according to South Korea and Japan would be capable of hitting any target within the United States mainland.

==== 2024 ====
In April 2024, North Korea claimed to have tested a new command and control system in a simulated nuclear counterattack.

On October 30, North Korea launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile since December 2023. The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff stated that the launch may have been timed to the 2024 United States elections. The missile traveled for about 86 minutes before landing off of North Korea&#x27;s east coast.

=== Fissile material production ===

==== Plutonium facilities ====
North Korea&#x27;s nuclear reactors are located at the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center, about 90 km north of Pyongyang.
* One Soviet-supplied IRT-2000 research reactor, completed in 1967. Uranium irradiated in this reactor was used in North Korea&#x27;s first plutonium separation experiments in 1975. Nevertheless, the primary purpose of the reactor is not to produce plutonium and North Korea has had trouble acquiring enough fuel for constant operation. The U.S. Department of Energy estimated that this reactor could have been used to produce up to 1–2 kg of plutonium, though the Joint Atomic Energy Intelligence Committee said that the amount was no more than a few hundred grams.
* A newer nuclear reactor with a capacity of 5 MWe. This gas-graphite moderated Magnox type reactor is North Korea&#x27;s main reactor, where practically all of its plutonium has been produced. A full core consists of 8,000 fuel rods and can yield a maximum of 27–29 kg of plutonium if left in the reactor for optimal burnup. The North Korean Plutonium Stock, Mid-2006, is estimated to be able to produce 0.9 grams of plutonium per thermal megawatt every day of its operation. The material required to make a single bomb is approximately four to eight kilograms. Often, North Korea has unloaded the reactor before reaching the maximum burnup level. There are three known cores which were unloaded in 1994 (under IAEA supervision in accordance with the Agreed Framework), 2005, and 2007.

:In 1989, the 5 MWe reactor was shut down for a period of seventy to a hundred days. In this time it is estimated that up to fifteen kilograms of plutonium could have been extracted. In 1994, North Korea unloaded its reactors again. The IAEA had these under full surveillance until later being denied the ability to observe North Korean power plants. Under normal operation, the reactor can produce about 6 kg of plutonium per year although the reactor would need to be shut down and the fuel rods extracted to begin the plutonium separation process. Hence, plutonium separation stages alternate with plutonium production stages. Reprocessing (also known as separation) is known to have taken place in 2003 for the first core and 2005 for the second core.
* Two Magnox reactors (50 MWe and 200 MWe), under construction at Yongbyon and Taechon. If completed, 50 MWe reactor would be capable of producing 60 kg of plutonium per year, enough for approximately 10 weapons and 200 MWe reactor 220 kg of plutonium annually, enough for approximately 40 weapons. Construction was halted in 1994 about a year from completion in accord with the Agreed Framework, and by 2004 the structures and pipework had deteriorated badly.
* Fuel reprocessing facility that recovers uranium and plutonium from spent fuel using the PUREX process. Based on extended Eurochemic reprocessing plant design at the Mol-Dessel site in Belgium. In 1994 its activity was frozen in accord with the Agreed Framework. On April 25, 2009, North Korean news agency KCNA, reported the resumption of reprocessing of spent fuel to recover plutonium.

On March 12, 1993, North Korea said that it planned to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and refused to allow IAEA inspectors access to its nuclear sites. By 1994, the United States believed that North Korea had enough reprocessed plutonium to produce about 10 bombs with the amount of plutonium increasing. Faced with diplomatic pressure after UN Security Council Resolution 825 and the threat of American military air strikes against the reactor, North Korea agreed to dismantle its plutonium program as part of the Agreed Framework in which South Korea and the United States would provide North Korea with light water reactors and fuel oil until those reactors could be completed.

Because the light water reactors would require enriched uranium to be imported from outside North Korea, the amount of reactor fuel and waste could be more easily tracked, making it more difficult to divert nuclear waste to be reprocessed into plutonium. However, the Agreed Framework was mired in difficulties, with each side blaming the other for the delays in implementation; as a result, the light water reactors were never finished. In late 2002, after fuel aid was suspended, North Korea returned to using its old reactors.

In 2006, there were eight sites identified as potential test explosion sites for current (and future) tests according to a statement by the South Korean Parliament. These sites are distinguished from a number of other nuclear materials production facilities in that they are thought to be most closely identified with a military, or potentially military purpose:

1. Hamgyong Bukdo (North Hamgyong) Province – two sites:
* Chungjinsi – Nuclear fuel storage site, military base and unidentified underground facility
* Kiljugun – Extensive military buildup with motorized troop formations and construction of new advanced underground facility – Site of May 25, 2009, Nuclear Test.
* Phunggyere – Site of October 9, 2006, Nuclear Test

2. Chagangdo Province – one site: Kanggyesi – Production center of North Korea&#x27;s advanced equipment and munitions since 1956. Also, extensive intelligence of highly advanced underground facility.

3. Pyongan Bukdo (North Pyongan) Province – four sites:
* Yongbyonsi – 2 Sites – Location of Yongbyon Nuclear Research Center, and the facility&#x27;s Experimental Test Explosion facility and two unidentified underground facilities. In addition, there is a gas-graphite reactor, HE test site, nuclear fuel fabrication site, nuclear waste storage site
* Kusungsi – Between 1997 and September 2002, approximately 70 test explosions of North Korean munitions took place. Also, existence of underground facility
* Taechongun – 200MWe Nuclear Energy Plant construction site. Location of unidentified underground facility and nuclear arms/energy related facilities known to exist

4. Pyongan Namdo (South Pyongan) Province – one site: Pyongsungsi – Location of National Science Academy and extensive underground facility whose purpose is not known.

==== Highly enriched uranium program ====
North Korea possesses uranium mines containing an estimated 4 million tons of high-grade uranium ore.

Prime minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan allegedly, through Pakistan&#x27;s former top scientist, Abdul Qadeer Khan, supplied key data, stored on CDs, on uranium enrichment and information to North Korea in exchange for missile technology around 1990–1996, according to U.S. intelligence officials. President Pervez Musharraf and Prime minister Shaukat Aziz acknowledged in 2005 that Khan had provided centrifuges and their designs to North Korea. In May 2008, Khan, who had previously confessed to supplying the data on his own initiative, retracted his confession, claiming that the Pakistan Government forced him to be a &quot;scapegoat&quot;. He also claimed that North Korea&#x27;s nuclear program was well advanced before his visits to North Korea.

Highly enriched uranium (HEU) program was publicized in October 2002 when the United States asked North Korean officials about the program. Under the Agreed Framework, North Korea explicitly agreed to freeze plutonium programs (specifically, its &quot;graphite moderated reactors and related facilities&quot;). The agreement also committed North Korea to implement the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, in which both Koreas committed not to have enrichment or reprocessing facilities. The United States argued North Korea violated its commitment not to have enrichment facilities.

In December 2002, claiming North Korean non-compliance, the United States persuaded the KEDO Board to suspend fuel oil shipments, which led to the end of the Agreed Framework. North Korea responded by announcing plans to reactivate a dormant nuclear fuel processing program and power plant north of Pyongyang. North Korea soon thereafter expelled United Nations inspectors and announced a unilateral &quot;withdrawal&quot; from the Non-Proliferation Treaty.

In 2007, a Bush administration official assessed that, while there was still a &quot;high confidence&quot; that North Korea acquired materials that could be used in a &quot;production-scale&quot; uranium program, there is only a &quot;mid-confidence&quot; level such a production-scale uranium (rather than merely plutonium) program exists.

Construction of the probable first uranium enrichment facility started in 2002 at a site known as Kangson/Chollima by US intelligence, and could have been completed and developing or operating initial gas centrifuge cascades in 2003. The facility was suspected by US intelligence for many years. The Pyongsan Uranium Mine and Concentration Plant in Pyongsan is reported to be where uranium ore is turned into yellowcake.

CNN reported on September 15, 2021, that North Korea is expanding uranium enrichment facility at Yongbyon with 1000 square meter expansion for additional 1000 centrifuges that would increase output of highly enriched uranium by up to 25% yearly and if centrifuges were to be replaced with upgraded centrifuges, increase in HEU production would be substantial according to Jeffrey Lewis, weapons expert and professor at Middlebury Institute of International Studies.

=== Stockpile estimates and projections ===
==== RECNA ====
In June 2020, the Research Center for Nuclear Weapons Abolition at Nagasaki University estimated that North Korea had as many as 35 nuclear weapons in its arsenal.

==== Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists ====
As of January 8, 2018, Hans M. Kristensen and Robert S. Norris of the Federation of American Scientists published in the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists that they &quot;cautiously estimate that North Korea may have produced enough fissile material to build between 30 and 60 nuclear weapons and that it might possibly have assembled 10 to 20.&quot;

====Defense Intelligence Agency====
On August 8, 2017, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported recent analysis completed the previous month by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency which concluded that North Korea had successfully produced a miniaturized nuclear warhead that can fit in missiles and could have up to 60 nuclear warheads in its inventory.

By 2019 the DIA estimated that North Korea had accrued a stockpile of 65 weapons&#x27; worth of fissile material and that the country was producing as much as twelve weapons&#x27; worth of fissile material annually. U.S. intelligence also assessed that North Korea had built around 30 fissile material cores for use in nuclear weapons, including four-to-six two-stage thermonuclear weapons.

====Siegfried S. Hecker====
On August 7, 2017, Siegfried S. Hecker, former director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory who has visited North Korea nuclear facilities many times on behalf of the U.S., estimated that North Korea&#x27;s stockpile of plutonium and highly enriched uranium was probably sufficient for 20 to 25 nuclear weapons. He assessed that North Korea had developed a miniaturized warhead suitable for medium-range missiles, but would need further tests and development to produce a smaller and more robust warhead suitable for an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and re-entry into the atmosphere. He considered the warhead as the least developed part of North Korea&#x27;s plans for an ICBM.

In February 2019, Hecker estimated that North Korea&#x27;s stockpile of weapons-grade material was sufficient for 35 to 37 nuclear weapons.

==== Institute for Science and International Security ====
For 2013, the Institute for Science and International Security gave a mid-range estimate of 12 to 27 &quot;nuclear weapon equivalents&quot;, including plutonium and uranium stockpiles. By 2016, North Korea was projected to have 14 to 48 nuclear weapon equivalents. The estimate was dropped to 13 to 30 nuclear weapon equivalents in 2017, but was increased to as much as 60 equivalents later in August of the same year. (For uranium weapons, each weapon is assumed to contain 20 kilograms of weapons-grade uranium.) An updated estimate of nuclear arsenal in 2023 has been made with range of between 35 and 65 nuclear warheads in North Korean inventory.

==== FAS ====
As of 2012, the Federation of American Scientists estimated North Korea had fewer than 10 plutonium warheads.

In its &quot;Nuclear Notebook&quot; on North Korean nuclear capabilities, published in January 2018, FAS estimated that North Korea had sufficient fissile material for 30 to 60 nuclear weapons. However, the report stated that North Korea had assembled 10 to 20 warheads at most, with most of those warheads likely being single-stage fission weapons with yields of 10 to 20 kilotons.

In the 2024 Nuclear Notebook, FAS estimated that North Korea had produced sufficient fissile material for up to 90 nuclear weapons and that up to 50 weapons had potentially been assembled. It was estimated that North Korea was capable of adding sufficient fissile material to produce an additional six weapons annually.

==== SIPRI ====
According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, North Korea maintains an active but highly opaque nuclear weapon programme. SIPRI estimates that, as of January 2024, North Korea possessed around 50 nuclear weapons, but that it probably possessed sufficient fissile material for an approximate total of up to 90 nuclear devices, depending on warhead design.

==== Korea Institute for Defense Analyses ====
In 2023, the South Korean government think tank Korea Institute for Defense Analyses published a report estimating that North Korea has between 80 and 90 nuclear warheads with up to 166 warheads by 2030 and a goal to increase to 300.

== Chemical and biological weapons ==
North Korea began to develop its own chemical industry and chemical weapon (CW) program in 1954, immediately following the end of the Korean War. However, substantial progress was not made until the 1960s, when Kim Il Sung &quot;issued a &#x27;Declaration for Chemicalization&#x27; whose aim was to further develop an independent chemical industry capable of supporting various sectors of its economy, as well as support chemical weapons production&quot; and established North Korea&#x27;s Nuclear and Chemical Defense Bureau.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, North Korea received Soviet and Chinese aid in developing its chemical industry. In 1979, the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency believed that North Korea &quot;had only a defensive CW capability.&quot; It is unclear when North Korea &quot;acquired the capability for independent CW production&quot;; estimates range from the 1970s to early 1980s. However, by the late 1980s, North Korea&#x27;s CW capabilities had expanded; the South Korean Ministry of National Defense reported in 1987 that the North &quot;possessed up to 250 metric tons of chemical weapons&quot; including mustard gas (a blister agent) and some nerve agents. In 2009 the International Crisis Group reported that the consensus expert view was that North Korea had a stockpile of about 2,500 to 5,000 metric tons of chemical weapons, including mustard gas, sarin (GB) and other nerve agents. The South Korean Ministry of National Defense had the same estimate in 2010. In 2014, the South Korean Defense Ministry estimated that &quot;the North had stockpiled 2,500 to 5,000 tons of chemical weapons and had a capacity to produce a variety of biological weapons.&quot; In 2015, the U.S. Department of Defense reported to Congress that North Korea&#x27;s CW program &quot;likely possesses a CW stockpile&quot; and likely had &quot;the capability to produce nerve, blister, blood, and choking agents.&quot; The report also found that &quot;North Korea probably could employ CW agents by modifying a variety of conventional munitions, including artillery and ballistic missiles. In addition, North Korean forces are prepared to operate in a contaminated environment; they train regularly in chemical defense operations.&quot; The report indicated that North Korea &quot;continues to develop its biological research and development capabilities&quot; and &quot;may consider the use of biological weapons as an option, contrary to its obligations under the Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention.&quot;

North Korea is a signatory to the Geneva Protocol, which prohibits the use of chemical weapons in warfare. North Korea is also a signatory to the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). Although the nation has signed the BWC, it &quot;has failed to provide a BWC Confidence-Building Measure declaration since 1990.&quot; North Korea is not a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). It is one of four countries that have not ratified the CWC (the others are Israel, Egypt, and South Sudan).

North Korea has refused to acknowledge possessing chemical weapons, as called for by United Nations Security Council Resolution 1718, passed in 2006.

After the 2010 bombardment of Yeonpyeong (in which North Korea attacked Yeonpyeongdo with conventional weapons, killing a number of civilians), the National Emergency Management Agency of South Korea distributed 1,300 gas masks to South Koreans living in the western border (a flashpoint for conflict); the agency also distributed another 610,000 gas masks to members of the South Korean civil defense corps, which numbers 3.93 million.
The agency also announced the renovation of underground emergency shelters. Gas masks are effective against some chemical agents, but not against blister agents such as mustard gas, Lewisite, and Phosgene oxime, which North Korea is thought to have in its stockpiles. In October 2013, South Korea and the United States &quot;agreed to build a joint surveillance system to detect biochemical agents along the demilitarized zone&quot; and to share information.

Also in 2015, Melissa Hanham of the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies released an analysis of a photograph of North Korean supreme leader Kim Jong Un visiting the Pyongyang Bio-technical Institute, a factory supposedly for the production of bacillus thuringiensis of use in pesticides. Hanham&#x27;s analysis concluded that the factory actually produces weaponized anthrax. Hanham noted that pesticide production factories are &quot;an old and well-used cover for a biological weapons program&quot; and an example of dual-use technology. A number of other experts agreed that &quot;the photos most likely show an operational biological weapons facility.&quot; The North Korean government denied the allegations; an official spokesperson for the National Defence Commission, through the official Korean Central News Agency, challenged the U.S. Congress to inspect the Institute and &quot;behold the awe-inspiring sight of the Pyongyang Bio-technical Institute.&quot;

North Korea possesses various types of chemical weapons, including nerve, blister, blood, and vomiting agents, as well as some biological weapons, including anthrax, smallpox, and cholera.
In 2017, Kim Jong-nam, the estranged elder half-brother of Kim Jong Un, was assassinated with VX nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur International Airport in Malaysia by suspected North Korean agents.

The identified stockpile is between 2,500 and 5,000 metric tons of chemical weapons. It is one of the world&#x27;s largest possessors of chemical weapons, ranking third after the United States and Russia.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
North Korea is deploying 250 new tactical ballistic missile launchers near its border with South Korea, escalating regional tensions. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un emphasized their role in potential confrontation with the US. This move comes ahead of the annual US-South Korea military exercise, which North Korea condemns as invasion rehearsals.

North Korea rejected UN criticism of its October 2024 ICBM launch, with Kim Yo Jong asserting the country’s right to self-defense. South Korea responded with sanctions and a joint drone drill with the US, while the UN Security Council planned to address the missile activity amid regional tensions.
== Delivery systems ==
=== History ===
In the late 1970s or early 1980s, the DPRK received several longer range Scud-B missiles from Egypt (which in turn received those missiles from the USSR, Bulgaria and Poland). The USSR had refused to supply Scuds directly to North Korea, but North Korea, starting in the 1970s, has produced missiles based on its design: a local production basis was established, and the first modified copy was named Hwasong-5. With time, more advanced types of missiles were developed. Eventually North Korea equipped itself with ballistic missiles, capable of reaching Japan. In the 1990s, North Korea sold medium-sized nuclear capable missiles to Pakistan in a deal facilitated by China.

North Korea&#x27;s ability to deliver weapons of mass destruction to a hypothetical target is somewhat limited by its missile technology. In 2005, North Korea&#x27;s total range with its Hwasong-7 (Nodong) missiles was estimated as 900 km with a 1,000 kg payload. That is enough to reach South Korea, and parts of Japan, Russia, and China. The Hwasong-10 is a North Korean designed intermediate-range ballistic missile with range capabilities of up to 2,490 km (1,550 mi), and could carry a nuclear warhead.

In an online interview published in 2006, the Japanese Ministry of Defense&#x27;s analyst Hideshi Takesada argued that North Korea&#x27;s desire of unification is similar to North Vietnam, and warned of the possibility of North Korea&#x27;s compulsory merger with South Korea by threats of nuclear weapons, taking advantage of any possible decrease in the U.S. military presence in South Korea, after North Korea deploys several hundred mobile ICBMs aimed at the United States. In 2016, Israeli analyst Uzi Rubin said that the missile program had demonstrated &quot;remarkable achievements&quot;.

Report on North Korea by United Nations Panel of Experts with information&#x27;s disclosed by various member countries that the status of its ballistic missile program as comprehensive and autonomous with guidance system being indigenous, demonstrated by recent test of a short range ballistic missile similar to Iskander and demonstrating depressed trajectory as such.

In January 2020, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff John E. Hyten said &quot;North Korea is building new missiles, new capabilities, new weapons as fast as anybody on the planet.&quot;

On October 19, 2021, North Korea launched a ballistic missile that landed in the Sea of Japan. Japan&#x27;s prime minister Fumio Kishida called the launch &quot;very regrettable&quot;.

The French think tank Foundation for Strategic Research released a report analyzing the North Korean nuclear arsenal and ballistic missiles. It estimated the accuracy of short range ballistic missiles such as Hwasong-11A (KN-23) and Hwasong-11B (KN-24) to be 35 meters based on satellite imagery and the distance between impact craters from missile tests, and 80–90 meters for the KN-25 large diameter guided rocket.

The Congressional Research Service issued a report citing a 2017 assessment by the Defense Intelligence Agency that North Korea has achieved a level of miniatuarization of nuclear warheads needed to mount them on short range and intercontinental ballistic missiles. CRS assessed that the Hwasong-11A (KN-23) SRBM, which can target the entire Korean peninsula, and the Pukguksong-2 (KN-15) MRBM, which can target all of Japan, can carry both conventional and nuclear warheads.

=== Operational delivery systems ===

There is evidence that North Korea has been able to miniaturize a nuclear warhead for use on a ballistic missile. According to Japan&#x27;s defense white paper North Korea does possess the ability to miniaturize nuclear weapons. A defense white paper from South Korea in 2018 said North Korea&#x27;s ability to miniaturize nuclear weapons has reached a considerable level. In a leaked report the American Defense Intelligence Agency also claims North Korea can miniaturize nuclear warheads for ballistic missiles. Whether North Korea has technology to protect their missiles upon re-entry is unknown. Some analysts suggest North Korea&#x27;s new missiles are fakes. Various North Korean rocket tests continued into the 2010s, for example in 2013, in 2014, and in 2016. North Korea performed no tests of medium-range missiles sufficiently powerful to reach Japan in 2015, but South Korea&#x27;s Yonhap news agency believes that at least one missile fired during North Korea&#x27;s March 2016 missile tests is likely a medium-range Rodong missile. An August 2016 North Korean missile test of a Rodong missile that flew landed about west of Japan&#x27;s Oga Peninsula, in international waters but inside Japan&#x27;s exclusive economic zone, prompting Japan to condemn the &quot;unforgivable act of violence toward Japan&#x27;s security&quot;.

As of 2016, North Korea is known to have approximately 300 Rodong missiles whose maximum range is 1,300 km (800 mi).

North Korea appeared to launch a missile test from a submarine on April 23, 2016; while the missile only traveled 30 km, one U.S. analyst noted that &quot;North Korea&#x27;s sub launch capability has gone from a joke to something very serious&quot;. However, as of 2023, there appears to be slow progress developing submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM), possibly as the development was lowered in priority given the good progress with substantially more survivable land-mobile missiles.

The U.S. is sanctioning six individuals and five entities in China for supporting North Korea&#x27;s WMD and ballistic missile programs. This network aided a DPRK representative linked to the Second Academy of Natural Sciences. The U.S. aims to disrupt these networks to counter regional destabilization and Russia&#x27;s actions in Ukraine.

==== Operational or successfully tested ====
* Hwasong-5 – initial Scud modification. Road-mobile, liquid-fueled missile, with an estimated range of 330 km. It has been tested successfully. It is believed that North Korea has deployed some 150–200 such missiles on mobile launchers.
* Hwasong-6 – later Scud modification. Similar to the Hwasong-5, yet with an increased range (550–700 km) and a smaller warhead (600–750 kg). Apparently this is the most widely deployed North Korean missile, with at least 400 missiles in use.
* Hwasong-7 – Also known as Nodong or Rodong-1, larger and more advanced Scud modification. Liquid-fueled, road-mobile missile with a 650 kg warhead. First production variants had inertial guidance, later variants featured GPS guidance, which improves CEP accuracy to 190–250 m. Range is estimated to be between 1,300 and 1,600 km.
* Hwasong-9 – The Hwasong-9, also known as Scud-ER, is further development of Hwasong-6 with range of (1000–1000+ km) and is capable of hitting Japan.
* Hwasong-10 – believed to be a modified copy of the Soviet R-27 Zyb SLBM. Originally believed to have been tested as the first or second stage of Unha, but debris analysis showed that the Unha used older technology than it is believed the Hwasong-10 uses. Also known under the names Nodong-B, Taepodong-X, Musudan and BM25, predicted to have a range of 2,500–4,000 km. A DoD report puts BM25 strength at fewer than 50 launchers.
* Hwasong-11 – Also known as KN-02, a short-range, solid-fueled, highly accurate mobile missile, modified copy of the Soviet OTR-21. Unknown number in service, apparently deployed either in the late 1990s or early 2000s (decade).
* Hwasong-11A – Also known as KN-23. 700 km range, Successfully tested on May 4, 2019. Similar to 9K720 Iskander. Demonstrated range of 800 kilometers on September 15, 2021.
* Hwasong-12 – a medium-range, liquid-fueled, mobile missile. First tested in May 2017. also known as KN-17 outside of Korea, South Korean experts estimate range of 5000 to 6000 km based on successful test conducted in May.
* Hwasong-14 – Also known as the KN-20, a long-range, road transportable ICBM, tested on July 4 and 29, 2017, estimated range is John Schilling estimates the current accuracy of the North&#x27;s Hwasong-14 as poor at the mooted ranges which threaten US cities (which would require more testing to prove its accuracy). Michael Elleman has pointed out that the NHK video which captured the descent of the reentry vehicle (RV) shows its failure to survive reentry. If the RV had survived reentry, the video would have shown a bright image all the way to impact in the sea. However a recent CIA assessment notes that North Korea&#x27;s ICBM reentry vehicles would likely perform adequately if flown on a normal trajectory to continental U.S. targets.
* Hwasong-15 – 13,000 km range, successfully tested on November 28, 2017.
* Hwasong-17 – potential range over 15,000 km depending on the warhead weight, according to initial Japanese estimate. The ICBM was believed to be first successfully tested on a full flight on November 18, 2022. The ICBM&#x27;s long-range accuracy, and its ability to survive re-entry, are unknown as of 2022.
* Pukguksong-1 – a long-range, solid-fueled, SLBM. Also called the KN-11 by the Defense Department. Possibly derived from the Chinese JL-1 SLBM.
* Pukguksong-2 – a long-range, land based development of the solid fueled Pukguksong-1. Also known as KN-15.

==== Untested ====
* Hwasong-13 – Road-mobile ICBM. Also known as KN-08. Maximum range more than 5,500 km (3,400 miles). The US Defense Department estimates at least 6 Hwasong-13 (KN-08) launchers are in deployment. A modified version, called KN-14 under the U.S. naming convention, was unveiled at a parade marking the 70th anniversary of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea. The missile development was halted due to engine problems.

== Exports related to ballistic missile technology ==
In April 2009, the United Nations named the Korea Mining and Development Trading Corporation (KOMID) as North Korea&#x27;s primary arms dealer and main exporter of equipment related to ballistic missiles and conventional weapons. The UN lists KOMID as being based in the Central District, Pyongyang. However, it also has offices in Beijing and sales offices worldwide which facilitate weapons sales and seek new customers for North Korean weapons.

KOMID has sold missile technology to Iran and has done deals for missile related technology with the Taiwanese. KOMID has also been responsible for the sale of equipment, including missile technologies, gunboats, and multiple rocket artilleries, worth a total of over $100 million, to Africa, South America, and the Middle East.

North Korea&#x27;s military has also used a company called Hap Heng to sell weapons overseas. Hap Heng was based in Macau in the 1990s to handle sales of weapons and missile and nuclear technology to nations such as Pakistan and Iran. Pakistan&#x27;s medium-range ballistic missile, the Ghauri, is considered to be a copy of North Korea&#x27;s Rodong 1. In 1999, intelligence sources claim that North Korea had sold missile components to Iran. Listed directors of Hap Heng include Kim Song in and Ko Myong Hun. Ko Myong Hun is now a listed diplomat in Beijing and may be involved in the work of KOMID.

A UN Security Council sanctions committee report stated that North Korea operates an international smuggling network for nuclear and ballistic missile technology, including to Myanmar (Burma), Syria, and Iran.

=== Export partners ===
Several countries have bought North Korean ballistic missiles or have received assistance from North Korea to establish local missile production.

;:Egypt has received technologies and assistance for manufacture of both the Hwasong-5 and Hwasong-6, and may have provided guidance systems or information on longer-range missiles to North Korea from the Condor/Badr program.
;:Iran was one of the first countries to buy North Korean missiles. Iran has established local production for the Hwasong-5 (Shahab-1), Hwasong-6 (Shahab-2) and the Rodong-1 (Shahab-3). Iran also possesses 19 land-based BM25 Musudan missiles, according to a leaked, classified U.S. State Department cable, Iran designated the Musudan as Khorramshahr. This nuclear-capable missile is currently under development and failed its two known flight tests.
;:North Korean entities continued to provide assistance to Pakistan&#x27;s ballistic missile program during the first half of 1999 in return for nuclear weapons technology. Such assistance was critical to Islamabad&#x27;s efforts to produce ballistic missiles. In April 1998, Pakistan flight-tested the Ghauri MRBM, which is based on North Korea&#x27;s Nodong missile. Also in April 1998, the United States imposed sanctions against Pakistani and North Korean entities for their role in transferring Missile Technology Control Regime Category I ballistic missile-related technology.
:Syria originally obtained the Scud-B from North Korea. North Korea may have assisted Syria in development of the Scud-C and/or the Scud-D. As of 2013, Syria relies on foreign assistance from multiple countries, including North Korea, for advanced missile components and technologies. In 2018, a United Nations report alleged that North Korea had been sending technicians and material to Syria to assist in its chemical weapons program, including acid-resistant tiles, valves, and thermometers.
:25 Hwasong-5s were purchased from North Korea in 1989. The UAE Union Defence Force were not satisfied with the quality of the missiles, and they were kept in storage.
:Vietnam reportedly ordered Hwasong-5/6 missiles in 1998–99, but it is unclear if this deal was fulfilled.
:Yemen is known to have bought Scud missiles from North Korea in the 1990s—a total of 15 missiles, conventional warheads and fuel oxidizer.

==== Former export partners ====
:Libya during the rule of Muammar Gaddafi had been known to receive technological assistance, blueprints and missile parts from North Korea.

==== Rejection by a potential export partner ====
;:In January 2004, the Nigerian government announced that North Korea had agreed to sell its missile technology, but a month later Nigeria rejected the agreement under U.S. pressure.

==International responses==
In the 1990s, the United States negotiated the Agreed Framework to freeze North Korea&#x27;s nuclear weapons program while pursuing the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. This broke down when North Korea&#x27;s clandestine uranium enrichment program came to light in 2002, after which China convened the six-party talks to negotiate a step-by-step process to denuclearization. The six-party talks stalled after multiple North Korean nuclear and missile tests, leading to increased international Sanctions against North Korea, including a series of sanctions resolutions imposed by the United Nations Security Council. In 2018, Presidents Moon Jae-in of South Korea and Donald Trump of the United States held a series of summits with Kim Jong Un which led to declarations in favor of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

==International inspections==
On October 31, 2018, lawmaker Kim Min-ki of South Korea&#x27;s ruling Democratic Party of Korea issued a statement revealing that officials from South Korea&#x27;s National Intelligence Service had observed several of North Korea&#x27;s nuclear and missile test sites and that they were now ready for the upcoming international inspections. Kim also stated that the now inactive North Korean Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site and the Sohae Satellite launching ground were included in these observations. The visit by the intelligence officials was in tandem with the September 2018 Pyongyang Agreement, which saw North Korean leader Kim Jung-Un agree to close Sohae and allow international experts to observe the dismantling of the missile engine testing site and a launch pad. The international experts will also be allowed to witness the dismantling of other North Korean nuclear and missile test sites as well. Yongbyon, the main nuclear facility in North Korea, has also been inactive during the past year as well, but has not yet completely closed.

<doc id="106427" wikidata="Q3078137" url="?curid=106427" title="North Korea–United States relations">
<text>Relations between North Korea and the United States have been historically hostile. The two countries have no formal diplomatic relations. Instead, they have adopted an indirect diplomatic arrangement using neutral intermediaries. The Swedish Embassy in Pyongyang is the U.S. protecting power and provides limited consular services to U.S. citizens. North Korea, officially the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (DPRK), does not have an embassy in Washington, D.C., but is represented in the United States through its mission to the United Nations in New York City which serves as North Korea&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; embassy.

The source of the hostilities dates back to the Korean War in which both countries fought on opposite sides. Since the armistice was signed, areas of contention have since revolved around North Korea&#x27;s nuclear weapons program and missile tests, North Korea&#x27;s human rights record, U.S. sanctions against North Korea, and military exercises held by the U.S. and South Korea. Despite no formal diplomatic relations, both sides have maintained contact to deescalate tensions. According to the policy objectives of the U.S. State Department, &quot;Peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula is the ultimate goal for the United States in its relationship with the DPRK&quot;.

==Defining issues of contention==
In recent years relations have been largely defined by heavy U.S. military presence in South Korea, joint U.S.–South Korea military exercises in the South China Sea, US economic sanctions against North Korea for North Korea&#x27;s nuclear program and North Korea&#x27;s demand that the United States eliminate its nuclear arsenal that could reach the Korean peninsula.

North Korea has conducted six tests of nuclear weapons between 2006 and 2017. It has developed long-range missiles capable of striking targets thousands of miles away, possibly as far away as the continental United States, and threatened to strike the United States (as recently as 2013) and South Korea with nuclear weapons and conventional forces.

The United States&#x27; nuclear weapons program in nearby Guam consists of B-1B Lancer bombers and B-2 Spirit bombers capable of launching nuclear weapons &quot;60 times more destructive than the bomb dropped on Nagasaki.&quot; From Guam, the U.S. conducts precision strike exercises to simulate a preemptive nuclear strike on North Korea.

Since the Korean War, the United States has maintained a strong military presence in South Korea with 28,500 troops, 90 Patriot missiles and five military bases.

The United States has not adopted a No First Use nuclear weapons policy. North Korea&#x27;s stated policy position is that nuclear weapons &quot;will never be abused or used as a means for preemptive strike&quot;, but if there is an &quot;attempt to have recourse to military force against us&quot; North Korea may use their &quot;most powerful offensive strength in advance to punish them&quot;.

==Polling on U.S.–North Korea relations==
In a 2020 YouGov poll conducted in the run-up to the US presidential election, the Washington-based Korea Economic Institute (KEI) of America, which commissioned the poll, reported only 31% of respondents approved of President Donald Trump&#x27;s diplomatic overtures to North Korea, though a senior director at KEI conjectured support for diplomatic relations was weakened by Trump&#x27;s calling Kim Jong Un, North Korea&#x27;s leader, a &quot;friend&quot; and saying &quot;they fell in love with each other.&quot;

Support among the American public for US forces to defend South Korea has increased steadily. While it was at a mere 26% in 1990, it nearly tripled to 62% in 2017, and in 2020, more than six in 10 Americans viewed the U.S. military alliance with South Korea as advantageous, with over half wanting to maintain the US troop level at nearly 30,000 soldiers. In 2017, a majority of the American public also had a positive view of Moon Jae-in, the South Korean President, who in 2018 supported a formal declaration to end the U.S.–North Korean war.

As relations with Korea waxed hot and cold under President Trump, American public opinion regarding North Korea likewise fluctuated sharply, and no clear picture emerges. In a 2020 Gallup Poll, only 12% of the Americans surveyed gave North Korea a positive rating.

A Harris poll published in 2023 found that 68% of United States respondents believed that Joe Biden should offer direct talks with Kim Jong-Un. 58% agreed that the United States should offer North Korea with economic or diplomatic incentives in exchange for steps towards de-nuclearization.

In July 2024, North Korea dismissed Trump&#x27;s claims of a close relationship with Kim Jong-un as ineffective, emphasizing that their bond didn&#x27;t lead to substantial changes. Pyongyang reiterated that future DPRK-US relations depend on US actions, urging a shift in policy. Despite Trump&#x27;s summits with Kim, no lasting diplomatic progress was achieved.

==History==

Following World War II, the United Nations divided Korea along the 38th parallel, intending this as a temporary measure. A breakdown in relations between the U.S. and USSR, however, prevented a reunification. As a result, in August 1945, the U.S. and U.S.S.R. divided control over the Korean Peninsula, with the Soviet Army and its proxies supporting a communist government in the North and the U.S. supporting a capitalist government in the South.

===Cold War===
====Pre–Korean War (1948–1950)====
On September 9, 1948, Workers&#x27; Party of Korea leader Kim Il Sung declared the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea; he promptly received diplomatic recognition from the Soviet Union, but not the United States. The U.S. did not extend, and has never extended formal diplomatic recognition to the DPRK. Kim Il-Sung&#x27;s anti-American rhetoric often asserted that the U.S. was a capitalist and imperialist successor to Japan, Korea&#x27;s colonial occupier from 1910 to 1945. In December 1950, the United States initiated economic sanctions against the DPRK under the Trading with the Enemy Act, which lasted until 2008.

====Korean War (1950–1953)====

=====October–December 1950=====
On June 25, 1950, 75,000 soldiers from the Korean People&#x27;s Army crossed the 38th Parallel to invade South Korea, starting the Korea War, the first military action of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union. After two months, North Korea had nearly conquered South Korea, however, US-led United Nations forces were able to push them back and in October 1950, they invaded North Korea and advanced towards the Chinese border prompting a full-scale Chinese intervention which forced UN forces to retreat from North Korea. The final two years of the war turned into a war of attrition along the 38th parallel. An estimated three million soldiers and civilians lost their lives in what has been termed &quot;The Forgotten War&quot; sandwiched between World War II and the Vietnam War. American General Curtis LeMay, who was head of the Strategic Air Command during the war, stated in a 1988 interview to Air Force historians that &quot;Over a period of three years or so we killed off, what, 20 percent of the population of Korea, as direct casualties of war or from starvation and exposure?&quot; During the war, the U.S. carpet bombed North Korea, dropping 635,000 tons of bombs on Korea, including 32,557 tons of napalm — more than the United States used in the Pacific War against Japan during World War II. 

==== Consideration of atomic bomb ====
In 1950, when President Harry S. Truman was concerned about the Chinese People&#x27;s Volunteer Army seizing South Korea, he said dropping an atomic bomb on North Korea was under &quot;active consideration.&quot; General Douglas MacArthur, who headed the United Nations Command during the Korean War, wanted to drop “between 30 and 50 atomic bombs ... strung across the neck of Manchuria” that would have “spread behind us ... a belt of radioactive cobalt.” B-29 bombers, capable of carrying atomic bombs, were sent to Guam, though the bombs lacked a plutonium core. Historians theorize the US, which had used atomic weapons at the end of WWII against the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, chose not to use nuclear weapons during the Korean War for multiple reasons: fear of escalation to a third World War; opposition from U.S. allies; lack of large urban centers to target in North Korea.

==== Public opinion ====
Public support in the United States to commit ground troops to Korea was at first, remarkably high. In June 1950, 78% of Americans said they approved of Truman&#x27;s decision to send military aid, and 15% disapproved. But by January 1951, public support for the war had plummeted to 38%.

==== Armistice ====

In 1953, the United Nations Command, North Korea, and China signed the Korean War Armistice Agreement for exchanging prisoners of war, marking a north–south boundary within a demilitarized zone, and suspending fighting. A formal peace treaty, however, was never signed.

In 1953, the U.S. signed a mutual security treaty, promising to defend South Korea from North Korean aggression by stationing U.S. troops along the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and including South Korea under the U.S. nuclear umbrella. The U.S. pledged to use nuclear weapons to deter and, if necessary, prevail in an attack on the South. In 1991, the U.S. removed its tactical nuclear weapons from the Korean peninsula after North Korea conditioned international inspections on their removal.

====Post–Korean War (1953-1991) ====

In the early 1960s, several American soldiers defected to North Korea. Only one defector, Charles Jenkins, returned to the U.S. and faced a U.S. military court, pleading guilty to charges of desertion and aiding the enemy. Jerry Parrish, Larry Abshier and James Dresnok died of natural causes in North Korea.

Some leafleting of North Korea was resumed after the heavy leafleting that took place in the Korean War, such Operation Jilli from 1964 to 1968. One leaflet was on one side a successful reproduction of a North Korean one won note, about six weeks&#x27; pay for an ordinary North Korean soldier, and on the other a safe conduct pass for defection to the south. The rationale was to allow soldiers to easily hide the pass, but the quality was sufficient for it to gain some use as a fraudulent banknote in North Korea.

===== &quot;Pueblo&quot; incident =====

On January 23, 1968, Korean People&#x27;s Navy patrol boats intercepted the United States Navy spy ship &quot;USS Pueblo&quot; in disputed waters, capturing and transferring the crew of 83 men to Pyongyang for imprisonment and torture. After almost a year of coerced confessions, beatings and a staged news conference, the crew was released following a negotiated settlement in which the U.S. apologized and pledged to stop spying on North Korea.

===== U.S. spy plane =====

On April 15, 1969, the U.S. Navy spy plane EC-121 was shot down over the Sea of Japan by North Korea; 31 American service men died. Historians theorize President Richard Nixon, embroiled in the Vietnam War, chose not to retaliate for fear of escalating the conflict to involve the Soviet Union and China.

===== Axe murder incident =====

On August 18, 1976, US Army Captain Arthur Bonifas and Lieutenant Mark Barrett were killed by the KPA with axes at Panmunjom when the Americans, over objections of North Koreans, continued trimming a tree that blocked the view of the United States Army–Republic of Korea Army military unit patrolling the Joint Security Area—an intensely guarded and combative area in the middle of the DMZ separating North and South Korea. President Gerald Ford responded with a show of force, authorizing DEFCON 3, a high state of military readiness. The North Korean government backed down and allowed the tree-cutting to go ahead in what the U.S. military termed &quot;Operation Paul Bunyan.&quot; North Korean supreme leader Kim Il Sung said the incidents in the Joint Security Area were &quot;regretful&quot; but stopped short of meeting U.S. demands for a formal apology.

North Korea and the United States had little to no relations during this time, except through the structures created by the Korean Armistice Agreement.

Nonetheless, in the subsequent years, Kim Il Sung met with high-profile political and religious figures including US House Representative Stephen Solarz (D-NY) and Reverend Billy Graham. Kim had granted an interview to Selig S. Harrison of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and Harrison Salisbury of &quot;The New York Times&quot; back in 1972. 

===Post–Cold War (1991–2017)===
====North Korea policy under Bill Clinton====
In 1994, North Korea blocked international inspectors from verifying the regime&#x27;s adherence to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. The Bill Clinton administration believed that the North Koreans were processing plutonium from a reactor to build two atomic bombs.

President Clinton recalled that &quot;I was determined to prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear arsenal, even at the risk of war&quot;. Declassified Clinton-era documents illustrate that the administration had planned for a possible war during the 1994 nuclear crisis.

According to former Pentagon officials, the Clinton administration drew plans to strike the North Korea nuclear reactor at Yongbyon.

President Clinton then sought Jimmy Carter&#x27;s assistance in a North Korea peace mission, during which Carter negotiated an understanding with Kim. Carter outlined a treaty with Kim, which he announced to CNN without the Clinton administration&#x27;s consent to spur American diplomatic action.

In December 1994 a US OH-58 Kiowa helicopter was shot down over North Korea, a pilot died and another was captured by North Korea and held for 13 days.

====Confrontations during Bush administration====

In December 2002, Spanish Navy troops, at the request of the U.S., boarded and detained a shipment of Scud missiles from North Korea destined for Yemen. After two days, following protests from Yemen and North Korea, the United States released the ship to continue its shipment to Yemen. This further strained the relationship between the US and North Korea, with North Korea characterizing the boarding an &quot;act of piracy.&quot;

In September 2005, the US alleged that North Korea produced $15–25 million worth of counterfeit Federal Reserve supernotes over several years for worldwide distribution in a &quot;direct attack on a protected U.S. asset.&quot;. Some governments questioned whether the DPRK had the capability to produce such high-quality notes.

Additionally, the U.S. accused Banco Delta Asia, a bank in Macau, of laundering money for North Korea&#x27;s nuclear program, though the bank called the accusation a joke. In 2007, an audit by Ernst &amp; Young found no evidence that Macau banks had facilitated North Korean money-laundering.

At various times during the Bush administration Dong Moon Joo, the president of &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, undertook unofficial diplomatic missions to North Korea in an effort to improve relations.

====Steps towards normalization====
On February 13, 2007, agreement in the Six-Party Talks – among the United States, the two Koreas, Japan, China, and Russia – called for other actions besides a path toward a denuclearized Korean peninsula. It also outlined steps toward the normalization of political relations with Pyongyang, a replacement of the Korean Armistice Agreement with a peace treaty, and the building of a regional peace structure for Northeast Asia.

In exchange for substantial fuel aid, North Korea agreed to shut down the Yongbyon nuclear facility. The United States also agreed to begin discussions on normalization of relations with North Korea, and to begin the process of removing North Korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism. The US Chief Negotiator Christopher R. Hill stated North Korea has adhered to its commitments. The sixth round of talks commencing on March 19, 2007, discussed the future of the North Korean nuclear weapons program.

In early June 2008, the United States agreed to start lifting restrictions after North Korea began the disarming process. President George W. Bush announced he would remove North Korea from the list of state sponsors of terrorism after North Korea released a 60-page declaration of its nuclear activities. Shortly thereafter North Korean officials demolished the nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, considered a symbol of North Korea&#x27;s nuclear program. The Bush administration praised the progress, but was criticized by many, including some within the administration, for settling for too little.

The United States public has historically favored diplomatic approaches over military ones in regards to North Korea. One study found that in 2004 the way the US government and the news media framed North Korea, led to such increased support for a non-military solutions among the American people.

====Dai Hong Dan incident====

On November 4, 2007, &quot;Dai Hong Dan&quot;, a North Korean merchant vessel, was attacked by Somali pirates off the coast of Mogadishu who forced their way aboard, posing as guards. As U.S. Navy ships patrolling the waters moved to respond, the 22 North Korean seamen fought the eight Somali pirates in hand-to-hand combat. With aid from the crew of the United States Navy destroyer USS &quot;James E. Williams&quot; and a helicopter, the ship was freed, and permission was given to the U.S. crew to treat the wounded crew and pirates. This resulted in favorable comments from U.S. envoy in Beijing, Christopher R. Hill, as well as an exceedingly rare pro-U.S. statement in the North Korean press:

The favorable result of the incident occurred at an important moment, as the North Koreans moved to implement the February 13 agreement with the acquiescence of the Bush administration, and the 2007 South Korean presidential election loomed, with the North Koreans taking pains to emphasize a more moderate policy.

====New York Philharmonic visit====
In February 2008, the New York Philharmonic visited North Korea. The concert was broadcast on Korean Central Television.

====North Korean detention of American journalists====
American-North Korean relations have further been strained by the arrest of two American journalists on March 17, 2009. The two journalists, Euna Lee and Laura Ling of Current TV, were arrested on the China–North Korea border while supposedly filming a documentary on the trafficking of women and allegedly crossing into North Korea in the process. North Korea subsequently tried the two journalists amid international protests and found them guilty of the charges, and sentenced them to twelve years of hard labor. Reporters without Borders criticized the act as a &quot;sham trial&quot;.

The ordeal was finally resolved on August 4, when former President Bill Clinton arrived in Pyongyang in what he described as a &quot;solely private mission&quot; to secure the release of the two American journalists. He reportedly forwarded a message to General Secretary of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea Kim Jong Il from then-U.S. President Barack Obama, but White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs denied this claim. Clinton&#x27;s discussions with Kim were reportedly on various issues regarding American-North Korean relations. On August 5, Kim issued a formal pardon to the two American journalists, who subsequently returned to Los Angeles with Clinton. The unannounced visit by Clinton was the first by a high-profile American official since 2000, and is reported to have drawn praise and understanding by the parties involved.

====ROKS &quot;Cheonan&quot; sinking====
On May 24, 2010, the United States set plans to participate in new military exercises with South Korea as a direct military response to the sinking of a South Korean warship by what officials called a North Korean torpedo.

On May 28, 2010, the official (North) Korean Central News Agency stated that &quot;it is the United States that is behind the case of &#x27;Cheonan.&#x27; The investigation was steered by the U.S. from its very outset.&quot; It also accused the United States of manipulating the investigation and named the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama directly of using the case for &quot;escalating instability in the Asia-Pacific region, containing big powers and emerging unchallenged in the region.&quot; The report indicated to the United States to &quot;behave itself, mindful of the grave consequences.&quot;

In July 2010, the DPRK government indefinitely postponed a scheduled talk at Panmunjom relating to the sinking. The meeting was intended as preparation for future talks at higher governmental levels.

====Relations following Kim Jong-Il&#x27;s death====
Kim Jong-Il died December 17, 2011 and was succeeded by his son, Kim Jong Un. On March 16, 2012, North Korea announced it would launch its Kwangmyŏngsŏng-3 satellite to mark the 100th anniversary of the late Kim Il-sung&#x27;s birthday. This announcement triggered American anxiety as satellite launches are technologically contiguous with missile launches. This tampered with Kim Jong Un&#x27;s earlier optimistic overtures and generated speculation on the issues confronting the new and young leader back in North Korea. The United States also suspended food aid to North Korea in retaliation for the missile plans.

Daniel Russel, Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director of Asia, and Sydney Seiler flew to Pyongyang from Guam in August 2012 and stayed there for two days. A South Korean diplomatic source said &quot;apparently President Barack Obama, who was then bidding for a second term in office, secretly sent the officials to North Korea to minimize disruptions to the U.S. presidential election.&quot; Other analysts say, &quot;Nobody can rule out that such direct dialogue between Washington and Pyongyang will continue in the future.&quot;

However, on December 11, 2012, North Korea successfully launched a missile in contrast to its failure in March. The United States strongly condemned the action as it was widely believed that North Korea was developing long-range ballistic missile that could reach the West Coast of the United States.

On March 29, 2013, Kim Jong Un threatened the United States by &quot;declaring that rockets were ready to be fired at American bases in the Pacific.&quot; The declaration was in response to two B2 stealth bombers that flew over the Korean peninsula on the day before. After Jong-un&#x27;s declaration, the Pentagon called for an advanced missile defense system to the western Pacific on April 3. United States Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel, said that North Korea posed &quot;a real and clear danger&quot; to not only the United States, but Japan and South Korea as well. The deployment of the battery to the US territory of Guam is the biggest demonstration yet that Washington regards the confrontation with North Korea as more worrying than similar crises of the past few years. It also suggested they are preparing for long standoff. While visiting Seoul, South Korea on April 12, 2013, United States Secretary of State John Kerry said &quot;North Korea will not be accepted as a nuclear power&quot;, and that a missile launch by North Korea would be a &quot;huge mistake&quot;. On April 18, 2013, North Korea issued conditions for which any talks would take place with Washington D.C. or Seoul. They included lifting United Nations sanctions and an end to United States-South Korean Key Resolve military exercises.

On April 26, 2013, North Korea said it had arrested Kenneth Bae, a U.S. citizen, for committing an unspecified crime against the country. On May 2, 2013, Bae was convicted of &quot;hostile acts&quot; and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. The U.S. has called for his release but North Korea has rejected any possibility of allowing prominent Americans to visit the country to request his release. Dennis Rodman, who had previously visited North Korea and become friends with Kim Jong Un, tweeted a plea for Bae&#x27;s release. Rodman said he would visit North Korea again in August and attempt to free Bae.

On May 2, 2014, Pyongyang&#x27;s Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) released an article composed of four essays written by North Korean citizens. The content of the article carried heavy criticism and racist remarks towards U.S. President Barack Obama.

Two American citizens were detained in North Korea in June 2014, accused of &quot;hostile acts&quot;. On July 28, 2014, the United States House of Representatives voted to pass the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act of 2013 (H.R. 1771; 113th Congress), but it was never passed by the Senate. On August 20, 2014, during annual U.S.–South Korea military drills, a spokesman for the North Korean government referred to Secretary of State John Kerry as a &quot;wolf donning the mask of sheep&quot;, the latest in an exchange of taunts between U.S., South Korean, and North Korean government officials. In January 2015, U.S. President Barack Obama indicated that he believed that over time the North Korean government will collapse. On July 28, 2016, a North Korean top diplomat for U.S. affairs claimed that the United States crossed the &quot;red line&quot; for putting leader Kim Jong Un on its list of sanctioned individuals, which was perceived by officials as the United States declaring war.

====Women cross DMZ====
On May 24, 2015, International Women&#x27;s Day for Disarmament, thirty women—including US feminist leader Gloria Steinem, two Nobel Peace laureates and retired U.S. Colonel Ann Wright—from 15 countries linked arms with 10,000 Korean women, stationing themselves on both sides of the DMZ to urge a formal end to the Korean War (1950–1953), the reunification of families divided during the war, and a peace building process with women in leadership positions to resolve decades of hostility.

In the weeks leading up to crossing the DMZ, Steinem told the press, &quot;It&#x27;s hard to imagine any more physical symbol of the insanity of dividing human beings.&quot;

On the day of the crossing, South Korea refused to give the women permission to walk through Panmunjom, a border town where the 1953 truce was signed, so the women had to eventually cross the border by bus. Nevertheless, Steinem labeled the crossing a success. &quot;We have accomplished what no one said can be done, which is to be a trip for peace, for reconciliation, for human rights and a trip to which both governments agreed.&quot;

===First Trump administration (2017–2021)===

In 2017, tensions mounted as U.S. President Donald Trump weighed military options against North Korea&#x27;s ballistic missile program. In the second week of April 2017, global media outlets erroneously reported that the USS &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; supercarrier had been deployed to the Sea of Japan heading towards North Korea, as a result of confusion created by a &quot;miscommunication&quot; between the &quot;Pentagon and the White House.&quot; A premature announcement on April 8 from the Navy led to a &quot;glitch-ridden sequence of events&quot;. On April 17 North Korea&#x27;s deputy United Nations ambassador accused the United States of &quot;turning the Korean peninsula into &quot;the world&#x27;s biggest hotspot&quot; and the North Korean government stated &quot;its readiness to declare war on the United States if North Korean forces were to be attacked.&quot; President Donald Trump called Mr Kim &quot;Little Rocket Man&quot; and a &quot;sick puppy&quot;, and promised that continued North Korean threats to America &quot;will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen&quot;. President Trump has at times called diplomacy with the Kim regime &quot;a waste of time&quot;. In reality on April 18, the &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; and its escorts were 3,500 miles from Korea engaged in scheduled joint Royal Australian Navy exercises in the Indian Ocean. The &quot;Carl Vinson&quot; aircraft carrier had been in the South China Sea in 2015 and again in February 2017 on routine patrols. In late April 2017, Trump stated that &quot;[t]here is a chance that we [the United States] could end up having a major, major conflict with North Korea&quot;. According to &quot;New York Times&quot; correspondent Michael S. Schmidt, Trump proposed using a nuclear weapon against North Korea and blaming the attack on another country, but was dissuaded by John F. Kelly. In July 2017, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson authorized a &quot;Geographical Travel Restriction&quot; which banned Americans from entering North Korea. On August 30, 2018, the ban was extended until August 31, 2019.

====2017 detaining of US citizens====
An American citizen by the name of Tony Kim, also known by the Korean name of Kim Sang-duk, was detained while attempting to leave North Korea through Pyongyang International Airport. In January 2016, an American student, Otto Warmbier, was detained at Pyongyang International Airport after allegedly attempting to steal a propaganda poster from his hotel. The other members of his tour group, which including several U.S. citizens, were allowed to leave without incident. Hotel security footage allegedly showed Warmbier going into a staff-only area of the hotel and removing the poster from the wall. In March 2016, he was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor, but in June 2017 was released from North Korea, having suspiciously fallen into a coma-like state. He died a few days after being repatriated to the U.S. North Korea claimed that they had nothing to do with his death. The China-based travel company that took Warmbier to North Korea as part of a tourist group stated that it would no longer accept U.S. citizens on its tours to avoid similar incidents. After Americans heard about Warmbier&#x27;s death, 49% wanted the administration to act, while 35% did not. Of those Americans who wanted action to be taken, the most popular response was for the U.S. to tighten sanctions on North Korea, and the second most popular was a total travel ban between the two countries. United States military action was the least popular response.

====Nuclear Intelligence Report====
In August 2017, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported on a confidential assessment carried out by the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency which suggested that North Korea had successfully developed nuclear warheads for missiles within reach of the US mainland. Reacting to the report President Trump stated that future threats would be &quot;met with fire and fury and frankly power, the likes of which this world has never seen before.&quot; In response North Korea announced that it was examining an operational plan to strike areas around the U.S. territory of Guam in the Pacific, including the Andersen Air Force Base. Officials stated that Joseph Y. Yun, the US envoy for North Korea policy, and Pak Song-il, a senior North Korean diplomat at the country&#x27;s UN mission, were making regular contact during this dispute, through a conduit of communication they called the &quot;New York channel&quot;.

====Trump and UN member states on North Korea&#x27;s threats====
On August 8, 2017, President Trump suggested that the United States was prepared to inflict &quot;fire and fury&quot; against North Korea if they failed to cease nuclear testing and threats. In response, North Korea issued a series of threats against the U.S. territory of Guam as well as allies such as Japan and South Korea. Two missiles were flown over Japanese territory and a nuclear test was conducted.

In a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2017, Trump threatened to &quot;totally destroy&quot; North Korea if the United States were &quot;forced to defend itself or its allies&quot;; he repeated his recent nickname for Kim Jong Un as &quot;Rocket Man&quot;. In response North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called the speech &quot;unprecedented rude nonsense&quot; and &quot;mentally deranged behaviour&quot;.

On September 23, 2017, the U.S. Military flew B-1B bombers from Guam, along with F-15C Eagle fighter escorts from Okinawa, Japan flew in international airspace over waters east of North Korea. Unlike on previous missions, the U.S. aircraft were not accompanied by South Korean or Japanese planes. Afterward North Korea said a missile strike against the U.S. is &quot;inevitable all the more&quot;.

On September 30, 2017, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the U.S. and North Korea were in &quot;direct contact&quot;, and &quot;probing&quot; the possibility of talks.

On October 9, 2017, US Air Force B-1 bombers carried out mock missile launches off both coasts of South Korea. Two bombers operating out of Andersen Air Force Base in Guam carried out the drills along with fighter jets from the South Korean and Japan militaries. This was the first nighttime B-1 bomber exercise between the three allies.

On November 28, 2017, North Korea fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and it was the first such launch from the rogue regime in more than two months. The missile, believed to be an ICBM by the U.S. Military, was launched from Sain Ni, North Korea and flew roughly 620 miles before landing in the Sea of Japan.

====2018 Singapore Summit====
On March 8, 2018, following a meeting with President Trump, South Korean diplomat Chung Eui-yong revealed that Kim Jong Un had expressed &quot;eagerness&quot; to meet with the President, and that his offer had been accepted, with a meeting proposed to take place before May. The move was described by South Korean President Moon Jae-in as a &quot;miracle.&quot; The meeting had been scheduled to be held on June 12 in Singapore, although after military exercises between the United States and South Korea, Kim Jong Un threatened to pull out of the summit, and on May 24 President Trump cancelled it. On June 1, 2018, Trump announced that the summit was &quot;back on&quot; for June 12 in Singapore after meeting with North Korean officials at the White House. President Trump met with Chairman Kim on June 12. During the meeting, a historic agreement was signed between the two countries calling for North Korea to reaffirm its commitment to the 2017 Panmunjom Declaration signed between North and South Korean to work towards completely denuclearizing the entire Korean Peninsula. The agreement declared a new start to US-DPRK relations between the two countries to achieve &quot;peace and prosperity&quot; through cooperation on issues such as the recovery of POW/MIA remains. Trump subsequently announced that war game exercises between the US and South Korean militaries would end.

====POW/MIA remains====
Thousands of U.S. military personnel went missing during the Korean war. Between 1990 and 2018, North Korea returned the remains of 340 soldiers, but about 7,700 bodies were still unaccounted for. The June 12, 2018 summit between the US and North Korea included a vague agreement to begin repatriating American POW/MIA remains. One month later, North Korea returned 55 boxes to the US. They were accompanied by the military identification tag of only one person, but other servicemen could be identified through matching DNA, chest X-rays, and dental records. By October 2019, it was reported that 35–40 servicemen had been identified.

====Aftermath====

North Korea&#x27;s state media declared a new era of peace following the summit. Reports emerged on June 23 that North Korea was removing anti-US propaganda.

On June 24, Trump stated that North Korea still posed an &#x27;extraordinary threat&#x27; to the US and maintained sanctions on the country despite declaring them no longer a threat the day following the summit.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo&#x27;s first visit to North Korea in July 2018 invoked disgruntled remarks from Pyongyang that the Trump administration was using &quot;unilateral and gangster-like demand for denuclearization&quot;. Pompeo maintained that the July talks were &quot;productive&quot;. However, the International Atomic Energy Agency has since stated North Korea is continuing with their nuclear program, and Trump announced the cancellation of Secretary of State Pompeo&#x27;s scheduled visit in August 2018 to North Korea due to insufficient progress in the dismantling of North Korea&#x27;s nuclear weapons program.

Interactions between the Washington and Pyongyang continue to fluctuate following the September 2018 United Nations General Assembly. In his speech, President Trump commended Kim Jong-Un for ceasing nuclear testing, dismantling several military facilities, releasing American hostages, and returning POW/MIA remains. Trump reaffirmed that sanctions will continue to be held on North Korea until denuclearization occurs.

====Assault on North Korean embassy in Spain====
On February 22, 2019, at around 3 pm a group of 10 people carrying real or simulated weapons entered the North Korean embassy in Madrid, Spain. They rounded up the eight embassy staffers who were present, put bags on their heads, tied them up, beat several of them and interrogated them. They robbed mobile phones and computer drives. The assault lasted for two hours, until Spanish policemen entered the building and the attackers fled in two of the embassy&#x27;s cars. On March 13, Spanish police and intelligence services identified two of the attackers as CIA operatives. The CIA denied any involvement.

====2019 Hanoi Summit====
The 2019 North Korea–United States Hanoi Summit was a two-day summit meeting between North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump, held in Vietnam on February 27–28, 2019. The leaders had intended to hold a signing ceremony on February 28, but the summit ended without a signed agreement. North Korea immediately resumed rebuilding its long-range rockets at its Sohae Launch Facility.

It was the second meeting between leaders of the North Korea and United States. It had been planned since the previous September, and its location and date was announced during President Trump&#x27;s third State of the Union on February 5, 2019.

After the summit, President Trump said he believed North Korean leader Kim Jong Un&#x27;s denial of personal knowledge about Otto Warmbier&#x27;s treatment in North Korean custody. Trump contended that it was not to Kim&#x27;s benefit to allow such abuse.

====Plans for third summit and exchange of letters====
On June 26, 2019, it was announced that talks were underway to hold a third US-North Korean summit. President Trump previously contended in April 2019 that a third summit &quot;would be good,&quot; On June 12, 2019, President Trump announced that he received a letter from Kim Jong Un which he described as &quot;beautiful&quot;. On June 22, 2019, an undated photo was also released by the North Korean government of Kim Jong Un reading a letter from President Trump. Kim described the letter as &quot;excellent&quot; and described President Trump as the &quot;supreme leader&quot; of the United States. However, Kim later denied that talks were still being held between North Korea and the United States, and relations still remained tense between North Korea and the US State Department.

====2019 DMZ Summit====

On June 30, 2019, President Trump met with Kim along with Moon Jae-in at the DMZ and briefly crossed the border line into the North Korean side of the DMZ, making him the first sitting U.S. president to enter North Korea; former US Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton had previously visited North Korea after they left office. After crossing into North Korea, Trump and Kim, who stated through an interpreter &quot;it&#x27;s good to see you again&quot;, &quot;I never expected to meet you at this place&quot; and &quot;you are the first US President to cross the border,&quot; met and shook hands. Both men then briefly crossed the larger border line before crossing into South Korea. During their meeting, President Trump also invited Kim to the White House, although later acknowledged that it probably wouldn&#x27;t happen in the near term.

It was also revealed that Trump&#x27;s daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner had visited North Korea to meet with Kim beforehand and acted as lead American diplomats during the summit. Footage of Ivanka meeting with Kim was broadcast by the North Korean media. Ivanka also described her visit to North Korea as &quot;surreal.&quot;

====Later developments in 2019 and 2020====
On September 10, 2019, Trump said he sacked National Security Adviser John Bolton as he strongly disagreed with Bolton&#x27;s suggestion about applying Libyan model to North Korea. However, Bolton himself said he was not sacked but resigned. Trump selected hostage negotiator with DPRK Robert C. O&#x27;Brien as the new National Security Adviser.

Talks in Stockholm began on 5 October 2019 between US and North Korean negotiating teams. After one day, the North Koreans said that talks had broken down, blaming US inflexibility. The US team, however, said discussions were good, and would be resumed in two weeks. On October 7, 2019, North Korea&#x27;s chief negotiator Kim Myong Gil cautioned about a &quot;terrible&quot; event that might take place if the U.S. did not offer a better deal to Pyongyang. He said that the ball is currently in U.S.&#x27; court to resume dialogue.

In December 2019, US Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft said during a meeting of the UN Security Council that was called at her request that the US was prepared to take &quot;simultaneous steps&quot; with North Korea to achieve peace. But she also warned the North Koreans against conducting further missile tests.

In April 2020, U.S. Rewards for Justice Program offered $5 million for information leading to identify North Korean hackers threatening the United States.

As of May 2020, North Korea has shown no indication that it is willing to unilaterally denuclearize as per U.S. intentions.

On June 12, 2020, the second anniversary of the Singapore summit, the North Korean Minister of Foreign Affairs released a press statement that the Trump administration efforts in the past two years were for political achievements without returns for North Korea and &quot;Nothing is more hypocritical than an empty promise.&quot; North Korea subsequently cut communications with South Korea, demolished the four-story joint-liaison office building it shared with South Korea on June 17, and ceased efforts for diplomatic relations with the United States.

In an article written in the Hankyoreh daily newspaper in July 2020, Moon Chung-in, Special Advisor to South Korean President Moon Jae-in, argues that the hardline approach of John Bolton and other US figures concerning North Korean disarmament will lead to eventual war, not peace. He believes a more effective approach towards North Korean denuclearization is for the two Koreas to work together economically until both sides depend on each other enough to be invested in each other&#x27;s national security.

===Biden administration (2021–2025)===
In early 2021, the United States under the presidency of Joe Biden attempted a new outreach to North Korea, to which they were unresponsive. On 18 March, the Korean Central News Agency put out a statement by North Korean first vice minister of Foreign Affairs Choe Son-hui acknowledging attempts at contact, and stating that North Korea would continue to ignore such attempts in the future. In it, she also criticized the United States for continuing military drills and maintaining sanctions against North Korea, and said that &quot;no dialogue would be possible until the United States rolled back its hostile policy toward North Korea and both parties were able to exchange words on an equal basis.&quot;

In October 2021, Kim Jong Un said the United States was a continuing source of hostility, and he made a public appearance in a showroom of advanced weapons. These weapons included one that Kim identified as a newly tested type of hypersonic missile that is difficult to shoot down; a new type of low-flying cruise missile; and what may be the world&#x27;s largest, but still untested, intercontinental ballistic missile.

On February 26, 2022, North Korea&#x27;s foreign ministry stated that the US measures that &quot;disregard&quot; Russian security concerns are a &quot;root cause of the Ukrainian crisis,&quot; in its first remark since Moscow launched a military invasion of its neighbour days earlier.

On March 5, 2022, North Korea conducted its ninth weapons test of the year, shooting a suspected ballistic missile into the sea east of the Korean peninsula, just days before the presidential election in South Korea. The launch was met with condemnation from the US, South Korea, and Japan, which worry the North is planning a major nuclear test in the coming months.

On March 11, 2022, after North Korea launched elements of its largest intercontinental ballistic missile in two recent tests, the US Treasury Department imposed fresh penalties.

In May 2022, the United States and South Korea announced expanded military exercises, which according to South Korean military officials would involve field training for the first time since 2018. A North Korean foreign ministry-run think tank stated that these exercises will create &quot;unprecedented instability security-wise.&quot;

In December 2024, the plenary session of the Central Committee of the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea adopted what it called its &quot;most hardline anti-U.S. response strategy&quot;, condemning its &quot;anti-communist&quot; policies and calling it the &quot;most reactionary national entity&quot;. It also condemned America&#x27;s alliances with Japan and South Korea as a &quot;an aggressive nuclear military bloc&quot; and called South Korea a &quot;ardent anti-communist outpost&quot;. It said the policy would &quot;strongly implemented for the prospective national interests and security guarantee of the DPRK&quot;.

=== Second Trump Administration ===
On February 20, 2025, North Korea criticized the U.S. over the AUKUS nuclear submarine deal, claiming it was a threat to their regional stability and peace. The KCNA claimed that the U.S. aimed for regional hegemony, and warned that the nuclear states won’t sit by idly.

==Nuclear weapons==
From January 1958 through 1991, the United States held nuclear weapons due to its diplomatic and military influence in South Korea for possible use against North Korea, peaking in number at some 950 warheads in 1967. Reports establish that these have since been removed but it has never confirmed by any independent 3rd party organization such as IAEA. The U.S. still maintains &quot;the continuation of the extended deterrent offered by the U.S. nuclear umbrella&quot;.

In September 1956, the U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Radford told the U.S. Department of State that the U.S. military intention was to introduce atomic weapons into South Korea. In January 1957, the U.S. National Security Council began consideration of this proposal upon President Eisenhower&#x27;s instruction, and then agreed to this. However, paragraph 13(d) of the Korean Armistice Agreement mandated that both sides should not introduce new types of weapons into South Korea, so preventing the introduction of nuclear weapons and missiles. The U.S. decided to unilaterally abrogate paragraph 13(d), breaking the Armistice Agreement, despite concerns by United Nations allies. At a June 21, 1957 meeting of the Military Armistice Commission the U.S. informed the North Korean representatives that the U.N. Command no longer considered itself bound by paragraph 13(d) of the armistice. In August 1957, NSC 5702/2 permitting the deployment of nuclear weapons in Korea was approved. In January 1958 nuclear armed Honest John missiles and 280mm atomic cannons were deployed to South Korea, a year later adding nuclear-armed Matador cruise missiles with the range to reach China and the Soviet Union.

North Korea denounced the abrogation of paragraph 13(d) as an attempt to wreck the armistice agreement and turn Korea into a U.S. atomic warfare zone. At the U.N. General Assembly in November 1957, the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia condemned the decision of the United Nations Command to introduce nuclear weapons into Korea.

North Korea responded militarily by digging massive underground fortifications, and forwarded deployment of its conventional forces for a possible counterattack against the United States forces stationed in South Korea. In 1963, North Korea asked the Soviet Union for help in developing nuclear weapons, but was refused. However, instead the Soviet Union agreed to help North Korea develop a peaceful nuclear energy program, including the training of nuclear scientists. China later, after its nuclear tests, similarly rejected North Korean requests for help with developing nuclear weapons.

North Korea joined the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) as a non-nuclear weapons state in 1985, and North and South Korean talks begun in 1990 resulted in a 1992 Denuclearization Statement. However, US intelligence photos in early 1993 led the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to demand special inspection of the North&#x27;s nuclear facilities, which prompted Kim Il Sung&#x27;s March 1993 announcement of North Korea&#x27;s withdrawal from the NPT. UN Security Council resolution 825 from May 11, 1993, urged North Korea to cooperate with the IAEA and to implement the 1992 North-South Denuclearization Statement. It also urged all member states to encourage North Korea to respond positively to this resolution and to facilitate a solution of the nuclear issue.

U.S.–North Korea talks began in June 1993 but with lack of progress in developing and implementing an agreement, North Koreans unloaded the core of a major nuclear reactor, which could have provided enough raw material for several nuclear weapons. With tensions high, Kim Il Sung invited former U.S. President Jimmy Carter to act as an intermediary. Carter accepted the invitation, but could only act as a private citizen not a government representative. Carter managed to bring the two states to the negotiating table, with Assistant Secretary of State for Political-Military Affairs Robert Gallucci representing the United States and North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Kang Sok-ju representing his country.

The negotiators successfully reached the U.S.–North Korea Agreed Framework in October 1994:
* North Korea agreed to freeze its existing plutonium enrichment program, to be monitored by the IAEA;
* Both sides agreed to cooperate to replace North Korea&#x27;s graphite-moderated reactors with light water reactor (LWR) power plants, to be financed and supplied by an international consortium (later identified as the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization or KEDO) by a target date of 2003;
* The United States and North Korea agreed to work together to store safely the spent fuel from the five-megawatt reactor and dispose of it in a safe manner that does not involve reprocessing in North Korea;
* The United States agreed to provide shipments of heavy fuel oil to provide energy in the meantime;
* The two sides agreed to move toward full normalization of political and economic relations;
* Both sides agreed to work together for peace and security on a nuclear-free Korean Peninsula; and
* Both sides agreed to work together to strengthen the international nuclear non-proliferation regime.

Historians Paul Lauren, Gordon Craig, and Alexander George point out that the agreement suffered from a number of weaknesses. There was no specific schedule made for reciprocal moves, and the United States was granted a very long time to fulfill its obligations to replace the dangerous graphite-moderated reactors with LWRs. Furthermore, no organization was chosen &quot;to monitor compliance, to supervise implementation ... or to make mid-course adjustments that might become necessary.&quot; Finally, other interested nations, like South Korea, China, and Japan, were not included in the negotiations.

Soon after the agreement was signed, U.S. Congress control changed to the Republican Party, who did not support the agreement. Some Republican senators were strongly against the agreement, regarding it as appeasement.

In accordance with the terms of the Agreed Framework, North Korea decided to freeze its nuclear program and cooperate with United States and IAEA verification efforts, and in January 1995 the U.S. eased economic sanctions against North Korea. Initially U.S. Department of Defense emergency funds not under Congress control were used to fund the transitional oil supplies under the agreement, together with international funding. From 1996 Congress provided funding, though not always sufficient amounts. Consequently, some of the agreed transitional oil supplies were delivered late. KEDO&#x27;s first director, Stephen W. Bosworth, later commented &quot;The Agreed Framework was a political orphan within two weeks after its signature&quot;.

In January 1995, as called for in the Agreed Framework, the United States and North Korea negotiated a method to safely store the spent fuel from the five-megawatt reactor. According to this method, U.S. and North Korean operators would work together to can the spent fuel and store the canisters in the spent fuel pond. Actual canning began in 1995. In April 2000, canning of all accessible spent fuel rods and rod fragments was declared complete.

North Korea agreed to accept the decisions of KEDO, the financier and supplier of the LWRs, with respect to provision of the reactors. International funding for the LWR replacement power plants had to be sought. Formal invitations to bid were not issued until 1998, by which time the delays were infuriating North Korea. In May 1998, North Korea warned it would restart nuclear research if the U.S. could not install the LWR. KEDO subsequently identified Sinpo as the LWR project site, and a formal ground breaking was held on the site on August 21, 1997. In December 1999, KEDO and the (South) Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) signed the Turnkey Contract (TKC), permitting full scale construction of the LWRs, but significant spending on the LWR project did not commence until 2000.

In 1998, the United States identified an underground site in Kumchang-ni, which it suspected of being nuclear-related following a Defense Intelligence Agency assessment. In March 1999, North Korea agreed to grant the U.S. &quot;satisfactory access&quot; to the site. The U.S. inspection in spring 1999 showed that the Defense Intelligence Agency assessment was wrong. In October 2000, during Special Envoy Jo Myong Rok&#x27;s visit to Washington, and after two visits to the site by teams of U.S. experts, the U.S. announced in a Joint Communiqué with North Korea that U.S. concerns about the site had been resolved.

As called for in Dr. William Perry&#x27;s official review of U.S. policy toward North Korea, the United States and North Korea launched new negotiations in May 2000 called the &quot;Agreed Framework Implementation Talks&quot;.

George W. Bush announced his opposition to the Agreed Framework during his candidacy in the 2000 United States presidential election. Following his inauguration in January 2001, the new administration began a review of its policy toward North Korea. At the conclusion of that review, the administration announced on June 6, 2001, that it had decided to pursue continued dialogue with North Korea on the full range of issues of concern to the administration, including North Korea&#x27;s conventional force posture, missile development and export programs, human rights practices, and humanitarian issues. As of that time, the Light Water Reactors (LWRs) promised in the Agreed Framework had not been delivered. The two reactors were finally supplied by the Swiss-based company ABB in 2000 in a $200 million deal. The ABB contract was to deliver equipment and services for two nuclear power stations at Kumho, on North Korea&#x27;s east coast. Donald Rumsfeld, the US secretary of defense, was on the board of ABB when it won this deal, but a Pentagon spokeswoman, Victoria Clarke, said that Rumsfeld does not recall it being brought before the board at any time. Construction of these reactors was eventually suspended.

In 2002 the US Government announced that it would release $95m to North Korea as part of the Agreed Framework. In releasing the funding, President George W Bush waived the Framework&#x27;s requirement that North Korea allow inspectors to ensure it has not hidden away any weapons-grade plutonium from the original reactors. President Bush argued that the decision was &quot;vital to the national security interests of the United States&quot;.

In 2002, the administration asserted that North Korea was developing a uranium enrichment program for nuclear weapons purposes. American-DPRK tensions mounted when Bush categorized North Korea as part of the &quot;Axis of Evil&quot; in his 2002 State of the Union address.

When U.S.-DPRK direct dialogue resumed in October 2002, this uranium-enrichment program was high on the U.S. agenda. North Korean officials acknowledged to a U.S. delegation, headed by Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs James A. Kelly, the existence of the uranium enrichment program. Such a program violated North Korea&#x27;s obligations under the NPT and its commitments in the 1992 North-South Denuclearization Declaration and the 1994 Agreed Framework. The U.S. side stated that North Korea would have to terminate the program before any further progress could be made in U.S.-DPRK relations. The U.S. side also claimed that if this program was verifiably eliminated, the U.S. would be prepared to work with DPRK on the development of a fundamentally new relationship. In November 2002, the members of KEDO agreed to suspend heavy fuel oil shipments to North Korea pending a resolution of the nuclear dispute.

Following Kim Jong-il&#x27;s death on December 17, 2011, his son Kim Jong Un inherited the regime. The latter announced on February 29, 2012, that North Korea will freeze nuclear tests, long-range missile launches, and uranium enrichment at its Yongbyon plant. In addition, the new leader invited international nuclear inspectors who were ejected in 2009. The Obama administration responded by offering 240,000 tonnes of food, chiefly in the form of biscuits. This indicated a softening of the west regarding North Korea&#x27;s insistence that food aid must comprise grains.

In late 2002 and early 2003, North Korea terminated the freeze on its existing plutonium-based nuclear facilities, expelled IAEA inspectors and removed seals and monitoring equipment, quit the NPT, and resumed reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel to extract plutonium for weapons purposes. North Korea subsequently announced that it was taking these steps to provide itself with a deterrent force in the face of U.S. threats and the U.S.&#x27;s &quot;hostile policy&quot;. Beginning in mid-2003, the North repeatedly claimed to have completed reprocessing of the spent fuel rods previously frozen at Yongbyon and lain cooperation with North Korea&#x27;s neighbors, who have also expressed concern over the threat to regional stability and security they believe it poses. The Bush administration&#x27;s stated goal is the complete, verifiable, and irreversible elimination of North Korea&#x27;s nuclear weapons program. North Korea&#x27;s neighbors have joined the United States in supporting a nuclear weapons-free Korean Peninsula. U.S. actions, however, had been much more hostile to normalized relations with North Korea, and the administration continued to suggest regime change as a primary goal. The Bush administration had consistently resisted two-party talks with the DPRK. A September 2005 agreement took place only after the Chinese government threatened to publicly accuse the U.S. of refusal to engage in negotiations.

In October 2024, Kim Jong Un visited North Korean missile bases, stressing the need for strong nuclear deterrence against U.S. threats and prioritizing missile modernization efforts.

===Six-party talks===

In early 2003, multilateral talks were proposed to be held among the six most relevant parties aimed at reaching a settlement through diplomatic means. North Korea initially opposed such a process, maintaining that the nuclear dispute was purely a bilateral matter between themselves and the United States. However, under pressure from its neighbors and with the active involvement of China, North Korea agreed to preliminary three-party talks with China and the United States in Beijing in April 2003.

After this meeting, North Korea then agreed to six-party talks, between the United States, North Korea, South Korea, China, Japan, and Russia. The first round of talks were held in August 2003, with subsequent rounds being held at regular intervals. After 13 months of freezing talks between the fifth round&#x27;s first and second phases, North Korea returned to the talks. This behavior was in retaliation for the US&#x27;s action of freezing offshore North Korean bank accounts in Macau. In early 2005, the US government told its East Asia allies that Pyongyang had exported nuclear material to Libya. This backfired when Asian allies discovered that the US government had concealed the involvement of Pakistan; a key U.S. ally was the weapon&#x27;s middle man. In March 2005, Condoleezza Rice had to travel to East Asia in an effort to repair the damage.

The third phase of the fifth round of talks held on February 8, 2007, concluded with a landmark action-for-action agreement. Goodwill by all sides has led to the US unfreezing all of the North Korean assets on March 19, 2007.

As of October 11, 2008, North Korea has agreed to all U.S. nuclear inspection demands, and the Bush administration responded by removing North Korea from a terrorism blacklist despite the American government threatening to end negotiations.

===Removal from terror list===
On October 11, 2008, the U.S. and North Korea secured an agreement in which North Korea agreed to resume disarmament of its nuclear program and once again allowed inspectors to conduct forensic tests of its available nuclear materials. The North also agreed to provide full details on its long-rumored uranium program. These latest developments culminated in North Korea&#x27;s long-awaited removal from America&#x27;s &quot;State Sponsors of Terrorism&quot; list on the same day.

===Nuclear tests===
====2006====

U.S. intelligence agencies confirmed that a test occurred. Tony Snow, President George W. Bush&#x27;s White House Press Secretary, said that the United States would go to the United Nations to determine &quot;what our next steps should be in response to this very serious step.&quot; On Monday, October 9, 2006, President Bush stated in a televised speech that such a claim of a test is a &quot;provocative act&quot; and the U.S. condemns such acts. President Bush stated that the United States is &quot;committed to diplomacy&quot; but will &quot;continue to protect America and America&#x27;s interests.&quot; The Six-Party Talks, below, resulted.

====2009====

On May 25, 2009, American-North Korean relations further deteriorated when North Korea conducted yet another nuclear test, the first since the 2006 test. The test was once again conducted underground and exploded with a yield comparable to the Little Boy and Fat Man bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, respectively. The United States reacted favorably to China and Russia&#x27;s reactions, who condemned North Korea&#x27;s actions even though they are both strong allies of North Korea. The U.S., along with all other members of the stalled six-party talks, strongly condemned the test and said that North Korea would &quot;pay a price for its actions.&quot;

====2013====

On January 24, 2013, officials in North Korea openly stated that they intended to plan out a third nuclear test. A written statement from the National Defence Commission of North Korea stated &quot;a nuclear test of higher level will target against the U.S., the sworn enemy of the Korean people.&quot; The United States intelligence community believes that, as of January 2013, North Korea has the capability to target Hawaii with its current technology and resources, and could reach the contiguous United States within three years. The White House has declared the Korean statement as &quot;needlessly provocative&quot; and that &quot;further provocations would only increase Pyongyang&#x27;s isolation.&quot; Analysis of satellite photos done by the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies of the Punggye-ri nuclear test site indicates that North Korea was readying for nuclear tests at the same time it issued the threat. Later statements by North Korea included direct threats against South Korea as well, stating that North Korea &quot;will take strong physical counter-measures against&quot; the South in response to UN sanctions against the North. A Gallup poll that was done in 2013 revealed that, &quot;Americans (55%) said the U.S. should defend South Korea if it was attacked by its northern neighbor, while about a third (34%) said it should not.&quot;

On February 12, 2013, North Korea conducted a third nuclear test.

====2016====

On January 6, 2016, North Korea conducted a fourth nuclear test. North Korean officials also announced that North Korean scientists have miniaturized nuclear weapons.

In February 2016, President Barack Obama enacted the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016, which passed the House of Representatives and the Senate with nearly unanimous support. The &quot;Inquisitr&quot; reported: &quot;In February, President Obama hit North Korea with a round of congressionally approved sanctions that severely limits the growth of the North Korean economy, a move that China criticized, stating that the sanctions could cripple North Korea&#x27;s economy.&quot;

==Public opinion on North Korea==

During Donald Trump&#x27;s first presidency, he and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un exchanged insults on numerous occasions. Trump often took to Twitter to talk about Kim Jong Un and the current North Korea situation. The situation had seriously elevated, worrying many Americans. A portion of Americans (22%) thought that North Korea posed a serious threat to the United States, while 60% of Americans thought it was no threat at all. Many Americans showed doubt and sometimes outright opposition to then-President Trump during the crisis. A plurality of Americans believed Trump lacked the responsibility to handle the North Korea situation, and many had more trust in U.S. military leaders than they did in Trump. Still, many Americans seemed to be unsure on who they are more comfortable with handling the situation. Americans were still hesitant of military action, as a majority of Americans still oppose preemptive military intervention. Top people within the military and government see this situation escalating to military action, while some still have hope that peace is possible. Still, the U.S. continues to impose sanctions on North Korea.


Q: How much do you trust Donald Trump to act responsibly in handling the situation involving North Korea – a great deal, a good amount, just some or not at all?


Q: How much do you trust North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to act responsibly in handling the situation involving North Korea – a great deal, a good amount, just some or not at all?


Q: How much do you trust U.S. military leaders to act responsibly in handling the situation involving North Korea – a great deal, a good amount, just some or not at all?


Q: To try to get North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, would you support or oppose the U.S. offering North Korea financial incentives such as aid money, or more trade?


Q: To try to get North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, would you support or oppose the U.S. bombing North Korean military targets?


Q: To try to get North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, would you support or oppose the U.S. agreeing to stop conducting U.S. military exercises with South Korea?


Q: In general, should the U.S. (launch a military strike on North Korea first, before it can attack America or U.S. allies) or should the U.S. (only attack North Korea if it attacks America or U.S. allies)?


Q: If the U.S. launched a military strike on North Korea first, do you think it would or would not risk starting a larger war in East Asia? IF RISK: Do you think that would be a major risk; or a risk, but not major?

However, although Americans are inclined to defensive and/or pacifist positions against North Korea, the Global Attitudes Survey conducted by the Pew Research Center in the spring of 2017 suggests how a majority of Americans (64%) expects U.S. military intervention if one of its Pacific allies (particularly Japan and South Korea) were to come into military conflict with North Korea. In contrast, the survey points to how 30% of Americans are opposed to such interventionism. In both a parallel and comparative perspective, a majority of South Korean and Japanese citizens (91% and 82% respectively) also expect U.S. military intervention if their country was attacked by North Korea.

In 2023, North Korea&#x27;s state newspaper Rodong Sinmun reported that approximately 800,000 students and employees nationwide voiced an interest in joining or reenlisting in the military to fight against the United States on Friday (17 March).

<doc id="106430" wikidata="Q909219" url="?curid=106430" title="Strife (1996 video game)">
<text>Strife (also known as Strife: Quest for the Sigil) is a first-person shooter role-playing video game developed by Rogue Entertainment. It was released in May 1996 in North America by Velocity Inc. and in Europe by Studio 3DO. The shareware version was released on February 23, 1996, while the full version was released on May 3. It was the last commercially released standalone PC game to utilize the id Tech 1 engine from id Software. The plot takes place in a world taken over by a religious organization known as &quot;The Order&quot;; the protagonist, an unnamed mercenary (sometimes referred to as Strifeguy), becomes a member of the resistance movement which aims to topple the Order&#x27;s oppressive rule.

&quot;Strife&quot; added some role-playing game elements to the classic first-person shooter formula, such as allowing players to talk to other characters in the game&#x27;s world or improve the protagonist&#x27;s abilities. Contemporary reviews praised these innovations and the story, but also criticized the quality of the graphics and the obsolete engine. Years after its release, the game was retrospectively considered to have been underappreciated in its day, and described as a precursor to games such as &quot;Deus Ex&quot;.

An enhanced version of the game, &quot;Strife: Veteran Edition&quot; (also dubbed &quot;The Original Strife: Veteran Edition&quot;) was developed and published by Night Dive Studios and released on Steam on December 12, 2014. &quot;Veteran Edition&quot; was also released on Nintendo Switch and Amazon Luna on October 25, 2020 and September 29, 2022, respectively.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Strife&quot;″s gameplay is standard for the first-person shooter genre; the action is observed from the protagonist&#x27;s viewpoint, and most of the game involves combat with the Order&#x27;s infantry and war robots. The main character begins with just a dagger, but more powerful weapons, such as a crossbow or a flamethrower can be found throughout the game. The protagonist also has an inventory where he can keep items for later use, such as first aid kits for healing, protective armor, or gold coins.

The game contains numerous friendly or neutral characters with whom the player can converse or trade. These characters often assign the player character missions, thus advancing the plot. If the player fires a weapon while not in a combat situation, it usually sets off an alarm and makes the guards attack the protagonist; however, certain weapons – the dagger and poisonous crossbow bolts – allow attacking enemies stealthily without activating the alarm.

Unlike most other first-person shooters of the time, &quot;Strife&quot; does not follow a linear series of levels. Instead, the town of Tarnhill acts as a central hub from which the player can travel back and forth between various areas, which stay the same as they were when the player left them.

The player character has two numerical attributes, accuracy and stamina, which can be improved at certain points in the game. The first attribute increases the accuracy of ranged weapons, while the latter increases the maximum amount of health.

==Plot==
The game is set some time after a catastrophic comet impact, which brought a deadly virus onto the planet. In the resulting plague, millions of people died, while other victims became mutated and began hearing the voice of a malevolent deity. They formed an organization called &quot;The Order&quot; and enslaved the rest of the populace, but a rag-tag resistance movement, called &quot;The Front&quot;, is trying to topple The Order&#x27;s reign.

The unnamed protagonist of the game is a wandering mercenary, captured by Order troops near the town of Tarnhill. After killing the guards and escaping, he meets a man named Rowan, who makes him an offer to join the Front. The protagonist receives a communication device through which he remains in contact with a female member of the Front, codenamed Blackbird. From then on, Blackbird provides assistance and commentary throughout the game. The protagonist heads to the Front&#x27;s base, where the rebel leader, Macil, sends him on a number of missions in order to weaken the Order. After several acts of sabotage, the Front proceeds to assault the Order&#x27;s castle. The protagonist, accompanying them in the attack, kills a major member of the Order called &quot;The Programmer&quot;. He loses consciousness upon touching the weapon that the Programmer had been using.

The mercenary wakes up in the castle, now taken over by the Front. Macil explains that the Programmer&#x27;s weapon is one of the five fragments of the &quot;Sigil&quot;, a powerful weapon worshipped by the Order. He orders the protagonist to find the remaining four. To this end, the mercenary visits a knowledgeable being called &quot;The Oracle&quot;, who reveals that the next fragment is being held by another of the Order&#x27;s leaders, The Bishop. After killing the Bishop and acquiring the second fragment, the protagonist returns to the Oracle, only to be told that the third fragment is being held by Macil himself; the Oracle claims that Macil is a traitor who has been using the protagonist as a pawn in his scheme. At this point, the player must make a decision: either disbelieve the Oracle and kill it, or trust the Oracle and kill Macil. This choice affects the rest of the story.

If the player trusts Macil and kills the Oracle (acquiring a Sigil fragment it was holding), he receives another task from Macil: to deactivate a factory, built on the comet&#x27;s impact site, where the Order is turning captured people into &quot;bio-mechanical soldiers&quot;. Upon completing his mission, the protagonist learns that Macil has gone insane; he returns to the base and attempts to speak to Macil, who declares in his madness that he wishes to free the &quot;one god&quot;, then attacks the protagonist. Upon killing Macil, the protagonist obtains his Sigil fragment. He then returns to the factory, where lies the laboratory of the Loremaster, another of the Order&#x27;s leaders. After killing Loremaster and thus acquiring the final Sigil piece, he uses the Sigil to unlock a door leading to the comet&#x27;s impact site. Inside, he finds an extraterrestrial spaceship. Within the ship waits an alien being known as &quot;The Entity&quot;; it is the one responsible for creating the Order and taking over the minds of mutated people. The mercenary kills it with the Sigil; its death means the end of the Order. He then finally meets Blackbird face to face. She tells him that his victory allowed mankind to create a vaccine for the virus, then kisses him.

The plot takes a different direction if the player decides to trust the Oracle and immediately kill Macil. Once he does so (claiming Macil&#x27;s Sigil piece in the process), the Oracle dispatches him to the Loremaster&#x27;s laboratory. Having killed the Loremaster and obtained his fragment of the Sigil, the protagonist returns to the Oracle, who then reveals that it was using him all along in a bid to acquire the complete Sigil, use it to free the &quot;one god&quot;, and attain eternal life. The mercenary kills the Oracle and, with all five fragments of the Sigil now in his possession, heads to the alien ship. There he encounters the Entity, but the being speaks with Blackbird&#x27;s voice, and implies that it was manipulating the protagonist throughout the game in order to regain freedom and take over the planet. After killing the Entity, the ending sequence is shown, this time less optimistic: the cure for the virus has not been invented and mankind&#x27;s future is uncertain.

==Development==

&quot;Strife&quot; was originally being developed by Cygnus Studios, the creators of &quot;&quot;, for id Software. Cygnus Studios was already working on another first-person shooter role-playing game, &quot;The Second Sword&quot;, utilizing the older ShadowCaster game engine by id Software. id Software asked Cygnus Studios to create a game based on the Doom engine and requested that the studio be relocated to Texas from Chicago while they were still developing &quot;Raptor&quot; so that they would be able to develop the new title for id Software. The studio agreed and after relocating, the studio no longer wanted to work on &quot;The Second Sword&quot; and the title was dropped in favor of working on &quot;Strife&quot;.

Cygnus Studios worked on &quot;Strife&quot; for a few months following &quot;Raptor&quot; being finished. However, internal conflicts soon arose and employees split off from Scott Host, the original founder of Cygnus Studios, and he re-located back to Chicago and &quot;Strife&quot; was essentially cancelled. This group of employees then founded Rogue Entertainment and resumed development on &quot;Strife&quot;. The shareware version was released on February 23, 1996, while the full version was released on May 31. It was the last commercially released standalone PC game to utilize the id Tech 1 engine from id Software.

===Community support===
After the game&#x27;s official support ended, game engine recreations of &quot;Strife&quot; were created by Doom source port developers through reverse engineering. Notably authors were Jānis Legzdiņš (author of the Doom source port Vavoom), Randy Heit (author of ZDoom), Samuel Villarreal (author of &quot;SvStrife&quot;), and James Haley (author with Samuel Villareal of &quot;Chocolate Strife&quot;). Except for the last, these allow for high resolution graphics modes, better mouselook, and expanded modding capabilities.

&quot;Strife&quot; was ported to the Amiga in 2013.

===Digital re-release===
In 2014 Night Dive Studios coordinated the digital re-release of &quot;Strife&quot; as &quot;Strife: Veteran Edition&quot; (or &quot;The Original Strife: Veteran Edition&quot;), after acquiring rights to the game. Because the game&#x27;s source code had been lost by Rogue Entertainment, a derivative of the Chocolate Doom subproject &quot;Chocolate Strife&quot; was used as the game&#x27;s engine, with its original programmers being contracted to do additional coding for the re-release. The source code of &quot;Strife: Veteran Edition&quot; was made available under GNU GPL-2.0-or-later on github.com. The enhanced version of the game was released as &quot;Strife: Veteran Edition&quot; by Night Dive Studios on Steam on December 12, 2014. &quot;Veteran Edition&quot; was subsequently released for Nintendo Switch on October 25, 2020, and for Amazon Luna on September 29, 2022.

==Reception==
&quot;Strife&quot; received quite positive reviews upon its release. Reviewers took note of the novel gameplay: unlike most previous first-person shooters, such as &quot;Doom&quot;, the player must cooperate with friendly characters in &quot;Strife&quot;, while killing everyone in sight ends badly. Some reviews praised the story, but the reviewer in &quot;Next Generation&quot; criticized it for being too linear and the choices being illusionary.

The voice-acting in the game was generally rated positively; in particular, the voice and personality of Blackbird was praised by some reviewers, with GameSpot&#x27;s Tal Blevins describing her voice as &quot;sexy&quot;.

&quot;Strife&quot;″s graphics were overall rated poorly. The reviewers criticized the game for using the obsolete &quot;Doom&quot; engine, which they considered especially jarring when compared to more modern games such as &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; or &quot;Quake&quot;. However, the hand-drawn illustrations which appear during dialogues and cutscenes were generally considered to be of good quality. Some reviewers doubted the novelty of the gameplay, pointing out that similar ideas were already used in e.g. &quot;&quot;. Limiting the player to a single savegame slot was also criticized, especially since making a wrong decision could make the game unwinnable.

Years after its release, retrospective reviews of the game were more positive. The reviewer of jeuxvideo.com recommended &quot;Strife&quot; for first-person shooter fans. Two articles about the game were published on the PC Gamer website. Richard Cobbett described the game in his &quot;Saturday Crapshoot&quot; series; he considered &quot;Strife&quot; to be an underappreciated game, but believed that it had not aged well. Paul Dean likewise concluded that &quot;Strife&quot; did not receive the attention it deserved back in its day, and encouraged readers to play the game. Both journalists compared &quot;Strife&quot; to the later &quot;Deus Ex&quot;, a more commercially successful attempt to combine the first-person shooter formula with role-playing elements.

<doc id="106435" wikidata="Q1391108" url="?curid=106435" title="Steve Caballero">
<text>Steve Caballero (born November 8, 1964) is an American professional skateboarder. He is known for the difficult tricks and air variations he invented for vertical skating and for setting the long-standing record for the highest air achieved on a halfpipe. In 1999, &quot;Thrasher Magazine&quot; named Caballero the &quot;Skater of the Century&quot;.

==Career==

Caballero was born with scoliosis, a condition which causes a curvature of the spine, although he has stated that the condition &quot;really hasn&#x27;t affected me too much.&quot;

He began skating in 1976 at the age of 12 and started his career at age 14. His first sponsor was Campbell Skate Park. 
In 1979, Caballero entered a national skate contest in Escondido. After finishing fifth place, he was approached by Stacy Peralta who offered him sponsorship with Powell Peralta. He turned pro in 1980 during the Gold Cup series at the Oasis Skatepark, Southern California. By this time, Caballero had invented the &#x27;Caballerial&#x27; (also known as &#x27;Cab&#x27;), a skateboarding trick also known as the fakie 360 aerial. Caballero is also credited with inventing the frontside boardslide.

In 1987, Caballero won both street and vert titles at the World Championships in Münster, Germany. The same year, on September 7, 1987, he set the world record for highest air achieved on a half-pipe by successfully executing an eleven-foot backside air at the Raging Waters Ramp in San Jose, California. Caballero&#x27;s record was later beaten by Danny Way in 1997. In 1999, Caballero set another record for the longest board slide on a 44 step handrail.

Caballero is a member of the Bones Brigade, and has appeared in many of their videos, including &quot;The Search for Animal Chin&quot;. His current sponsors include Powell Peralta, Bones Bearings, Independent Truck Company, Bones Wheels, Vans Skate Shoes, 187 killer pads, Merge4 socks, and Protec Helmets. His past sponsors included Tracker Trucks, Standard Trucks, and Red Dragon Apparel.

During the first half of the 1980s, Caballero was arguably the best professional skater and featured on the cover of &quot;Thrasher Magazine&quot; several times. He also features as a character in five of the &quot;Tony Hawk&quot; video games, from &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 2&quot; to &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Underground&quot;, and as a downloadable skater in &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater HD&quot;. Caballero&#x27;s most recent video game appearance was in &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 1 + 2&quot;, a remake of the first two games in the &quot;Tony Hawk&quot; series.

Caballero featured in Stacy Peralta&#x27;s 2012 documentary film, &quot;Bones Brigade: An Autobiography&quot;, which chronicles the life stories of members of the Bones Brigade skate team such as Tony Hawk, Rodney Mullen, Mike McGill, Lance Mountain and Tommy Guerrero.

==Other projects==
He has been a member of several punk bands including The Faction, Odd Man Out, Shovelhead, and Soda, and released a compilation CD of the various bands he has appeared in, titled &quot;Bandology&quot;, through Sessions Records. The Faction&#x27;s song &quot;Skate And Destroy&quot; featured on the soundtrack of Powell Peralta&#x27;s eponymous Bones Brigade Video Show. He also had an acting role as Juan in the 1984 Jimmy McNichol action movie &quot;Escape from El Diablo&quot;, together with fellow skateboarder Mike McGill. In the 1980s, Caballero published a skate zine entitled &#x27;SPEED ZINE,&#x27; which replaced &#x27;Skate Punk,&#x27; an earlier zine that he discontinued, in part, because he &quot;didn&#x27;t like the name anymore.&quot;

Caballero also paints, collects toys and comic books, rides motocross, and is a hot rod enthusiast.

Caballero started a new punk band called Urethane, who has signed to the Cyber Tracks record label. Their debut album, ‘Chasing Horizons’, was released on September 24, 2021.

==Personal life==
Caballero is of Japanese and Mexican descent. Caballero was raised Catholic but now attends a non-denominational Christian church in Carlsbad, California named Daybreak since 2005. He lived with his family for several years in San Jose until they relocated to San Diego, where the family currently resides.

<doc id="106439" wikidata="Q2307535" url="?curid=106439" title="Humacao, Puerto Rico">
<text>Humacao () is a city and municipality in Puerto Rico located in the eastern coast of the island, north of Yabucoa; south of Naguabo; east of Las Piedras; and west of Vieques Passage. Humacao is spread over 12 barrios and Humacao Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

The region of what is now Humacao belonged to the Taíno region of Humaka, which covered a portion of the southeast coast of Puerto Rico. The region was led by cacique Jumacao (also referred to as &quot;Macao&quot;). The Taíno settlement was located on the shores of what is called now the Humacao River. It is believed that the Taíno chief Jumacao was the first &quot;cacique&quot; to learn to read and write in Spanish, since he wrote a letter to the King of Spain Charles I complaining about how the Governor of the island wasn&#x27;t complying with their peace agreement. In the letter, Jumacao argued that their people were virtually prisoners of Spain. It is said that King Charles was so moved by the letter that he ordered the Governor to obey the terms of the treaty.

During the early 16th century, the region was populated by cattle ranchers. However, since most of them officially resided in San Juan, a settlement was never officially organized. At the beginning of the 18th century, specifically around 1721–1722, the first official settlement was constituted in the area. Most of the residents at the time were immigrants from the Canary Islands, but due to attacks from Caribs, pirates, and other settlers, some of them moved farther into the island in what is now Las Piedras. Still, some settlers remained and by 1776, historian Fray Íñigo Abbad y Lasierra visited the area and wrote about the population there. By 1793, the church was recognized as parish and the settlement was officially recognized as town.

By 1894, Humacao was recognized as a city. Due to its thriving population, buildings and structures like a hospital, a theater, and a prison were built in the city. In 1899, after the United States invasion of the island as a result of the Spanish–American War, the municipality of Las Piedras was annexed to Humacao. This lasted until 1914, when the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico voted on splitting both towns again.

Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1899, the United States Department of War conducted a census of Puerto Rico finding that the population of Humacao was 14,313.

Humacao was led by mayor Marcelo Trujillo Panisse for over a decade. A basketball star in his early years, Trujillo has pushed for the development of infrastructure facilities for sports and the fine arts in the city. In March 2008, a new Roman Catholic diocese was established as the Fajardo-Humacao diocese. Its first bishop is Monsignor Eusebio &#x27;Chebito&#x27; Ramos Morales, a maunabeño who was rector of the Humacao&#x27;s main parish in the 1990s.

In 2019, Luis Raul Sanchez became interim mayor of Humacao after Marcelo Trujillo Panisse died in September 2019.

On September 20, 2017 Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico. Punta Santiago in Humacao saw a six-foot storm surge. The hurricane caused destruction of homes and infrastructure.

There are minor elevations to the southwest, like Candelero Hill, and northwest, like Mabú. Humacao&#x27;s territory covers 45 square miles (117 km2). Two islands belong to Humacao: Cayo Santiago and Cayo Batata.

===Water features===
Humacao&#x27;s hydrographic system consists of many rivers and creeks like Humacao, Antón Ruíz, and Candelero. Some of its creeks are Frontera, Mariana, and Del Obispo, among many others.

In 2019, updated flood zone maps show that Humacao is extremely vulnerable to flooding, along with Toa Baja, Rincón, Barceloneta, and Corozal. Located where most cyclones enter the island, Humacao is one of the most vulnerable areas of Puerto Rico. Humacao was working on flood mitigation plans and shared that its barrios located on the coast; Antón Ruíz, Punta Santiago, Río Abajo, Buena Vista and Candelero Abajo barrios, are extremely vulnerable to flooding and destruction.

<text>The Agreed Framework between the United States of America and the Democratic People&#x27;s Republic of Korea (북미제네바기본합의서) was signed on 21 October 1994, between North Korea (DPRK) and the United States. The objective of the agreement was the freezing and replacement of North Korea&#x27;s indigenous nuclear power plant program with more nuclear proliferation resistant light water reactor power plants, and the step-by-step normalization of relations between the U.S. and the DPRK. Implementation of the agreement was troubled from the start, but its key elements were being implemented until it effectively broke down in 2003.

==Background==


On 12 December 1985, North Korea became a party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). On 10 April 1992, its NPT safeguards agreement entered into force. In May 1992, North Korea submitted its initial report to the IAEA under that agreement, and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspections began. Shortly thereafter inconsistencies emerged between the North Korea initial declaration and the Agency&#x27;s findings, centering on a mismatch between declared plutonium product and nuclear waste solutions and the results of the Agency&#x27;s analysis. The latter suggested that undeclared plutonium existed in North Korea. In order to find answers to the inconsistencies detected and to determine the completeness and correctness of the initial declaration provided, the IAEA requested access to additional information and to two sites which seemed to be related to the storage of nuclear waste. The DPRK refused access to the sites, and on 12 March 1993, North Korea announced its decision to withdraw from the NPT.

On 1 April 1993, the IAEA concluded that North Korea was in non-compliance with its Safeguards Agreement, and referred this to the UN Security Council. Following UN Security Council resolution 825, which called upon the DPRK to reconsider its decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and allow weapons inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) into the country, North Korea &quot;suspended the effectuation&quot; of that withdrawal in June 1993.

In November 1993, North Korea proposed to the United States that the two governments negotiate a &quot;package solution&quot; to all of the issues dividing them. The Clinton Administration accepted this in principle but conditioned such &quot;comprehensive&quot; talks on North Korea acting first to allow a resumption of IAEA inspections and to re-open negotiations with South Korea over nuclear questions (North Korea had broken off talks with South Korea in late 1992). North Korea approached the IAEA in January 1994, offering a single inspection, less comprehensive than those conducted by the IAEA in 1992. After several weeks of tough negotiations, the IAEA announced on 16 February 1994 that North Korea had accepted &quot;the inspection activities&quot; that the Agency had requested. In response, the Clinton Administration agreed to suspend the Team Spirit military exercise with South Korea (a long-standing North Korean demand) and begin a new round of talks with North Korea—subject to North Korea allowing full implementation of the IAEA inspection and beginning high level talks with South Korea.

==Agreement==

* Motivation : DPRK announced intention to withdraw from NPT and non-compliance with IAEA safeguards.
* Signed Date: 21 October 1994 by U.S. Ambassador Robert Gallucci and DPRK Vice-minister Kang Sok-ju
* Summary: Freeze of North Korean nuclear program, leading to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and initial Peace agreement between the United States and North Korea

The main provisions of the agreement were:
* DPRK&#x27;s graphite-moderated 5MWe nuclear reactor, and the 50 MWe and 200 MWe reactors under construction, which could easily produce weapons grade plutonium, would be replaced with two 1000MW light water reactors (LWR) power plants by a target date of 2003.
* Oil for heating and electricity production would be provided while DPRK&#x27;s reactors were shut down and construction halted, until completion of the first LWR power unit. The amount of oil was 500,000 tons of heavy fuel oil per year.
* The two sides would move toward full normalization of political and economic relations.
* The U.S. would provide formal peace and national security assurances to the DPRK, against the threat or use of nuclear weapons by the U.S.
* The DPRK would take steps to implement the 1992 Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula between South and North Korea.
* The DPRK would remain a party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
* IAEA ad hoc and routine inspections would resume for facilities not subject to the freeze.
* Existing spent nuclear fuel stocks would be stored and ultimately disposed of without reprocessing in the DPRK.
* Before delivery of key LWR nuclear components, the DPRK would come into full compliance with its safeguards agreement with the IAEA.

There were also some confidential minutes supporting the agreement, which have not been made public. These are reported to include that full-scope IAEA safeguards would be applied when the major non-nuclear components of the first LWR unit were completed but before the delivery of key nuclear components.

The commitments in the agreement were voluntary and non-binding, not approved by the United States Senate as with a treaty, though noted by the United Nations Security Council.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNSC-S/PRST/1994/64&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was signed in the wake of North Korea&#x27;s 90-day advance notification of its intended withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (which North Korea &quot;suspended&quot; after 89 days), a U.S. military buildup near the country, and U.S. plans to bomb the active Yongbyon nuclear reactor.

The U.S. regarded the Agreed Framework primarily as a non-proliferation agreement, whereas North Korea placed greater value on measures normalizing relations with the U.S.

Terms of the pact and consequent agreements included the shutdown of the pilot Yongbyon nuclear reactor, abandoning the construction of two larger nuclear power plants, and the canning and sealing, under IAEA monitoring, of spent fuel that could have been reprocessed to create plutonium for a nuclear weapon.
In exchange two light water reactors would be constructed in North Korea by 2003 at a cost of $4 billion, primarily supplied by South Korea. In the interim, North Korea would be supplied with 500,000 tons of heavy fuel oil annually, at no cost, to make up for lost energy production. North Korea was required to come into full compliance with its IAEA safeguards agreement, allowing the IAEA to verify the correctness and completeness of its initial declaration, before key nuclear components of the reactor would be delivered. When the LWR plants were completed, North Korea would dismantle its other nuclear reactors and associated facilities.

The Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) is a consortium of the United States, South Korea, Japan, and various other states that is responsible for implementing the energy-related parts of the agreement. North Korea would repay KEDO over a 20-year interest-free period after the completion of each LWR plant.

It was reported that US President Bill Clinton&#x27;s officials agreed to the plan only because they thought that the North Korean government would collapse before the nuclear power project was completed as North Korea&#x27;s leader Kim Il Sung had recently died.
North Korean officials at the time also suspected the U.S. anticipated an early collapse of the DPRK.

==Implementation of the agreement==

Soon after the agreement was signed, U.S. Congress control changed to the Republican Party, who did not support the agreement. Some Republican Senators were strongly against the agreement, regarding it as appeasement. Initially, U.S. Department of Defense emergency funds not under Congress&#x27; control were used to fund the transitional oil supplies under the agreement, together with international funding. From 1996 Congress provided funding, though not always sufficient amounts. Consequently, some of the agreed transitional oil supplies were delivered late. KEDO&#x27;s first director, Stephen Bosworth, later commented &quot;The Agreed Framework was a political orphan within two weeks after its signature&quot;.

Some analysts believe North Korea agreed to the freeze primarily because of the U.S. agreement to phase out economic sanctions that had been in place since the Korean War. But because of congressional opposition, the U.S. failed to deliver on this part of the agreement.

International funding for the LWR replacement power plants had to be sought. Formal invitations to bid were not issued until 1998, by which time the delays were infuriating North Korea. In May 1998, North Korea warned it would restart nuclear research if the U.S. could not install the LWR. Formal ground breaking on the site was on 21 August 1997, but significant spending on the LWR project did not commence until 2000.

U.S. officials in 1998 testified to Congress that there were no fundamental violations of any aspect of the Framework Agreement by North Koreans.

Joel S. Wit, State Department Coordinator for implementation of the Agreed Framework (1995–2000) during the Clinton administration, stated that &quot;we did know about the DPRK cheating on the highly-enriched uranium front starting in 1998.&quot;

The U.S. diplomat who negotiated the framework, Robert Gallucci has warned that it could collapse if United States did not fulfill obligations that it agreed to.

There was increasing disagreement between North Korea and the United States on the scope and implementation of the agreement. The United States did little to meet its commitment to normalize political and economic relations. When by 1999 economic sanctions had not been lifted and full diplomatic relations between the United States and North Korea had not been established, North Korea warned that they would resume nuclear research unless the United States kept up its end of the bargain.

Construction of the first LWR reactor began in August 2002. Construction of both reactors was well behind schedule. The initial plan was for both reactors to be operational by 2003, but the construction had been halted indefinitely in late 2002. Senators accused President Clinton of understating the cost of the project.

Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Rust Deming told Congress &quot;to be frank, we have in past years not always met the fuel year deadline&quot;.

==Final breakdown of the agreement==
In January 2002, U.S. President George W. Bush labeled North Korea in his first State of the Union Address as part of an Axis of Evil.

In October 2002, a U.S. delegation led by Assistant Secretary of State James A. Kelly visited North Korea to confront the North Koreans with the U.S. assessment that they had a uranium enrichment program. The parties&#x27; reports of the meeting differ. The U.S. delegation believed the North Koreans had admitted the existence of a highly enriched uranium program. The North Koreans stated Kelly made his assertions in an arrogant manner, but failed to produce any evidence such as satellite photos, and they responded by denying that North Korea planned to produce nuclear weapons using enriched uranium. They went on to state that as an independent sovereign state North Korea was entitled to possess nuclear weapons for defense, although they did not possess such a weapon at that point in time. Relations between the two countries, which had seemed hopeful two years earlier, quickly deteriorated into open hostility.

The HEU intelligence that James Kelly&#x27;s accusation is based on is still controversial: According to the CIA fact sheet to Congress on 19 November 2002, there was &quot;clear evidence indicating the North has begun constructing a centrifuge facility&quot; and this plant could produce annually enough HEU for two or more nuclear weapons per year when it is finished. However, some experts assessed that the equipment North Korea imported was insufficient evidence of a production-scale enrichment program.

KEDO members considered in November 2002 whether to halt the fuel oil shipments in response to the previous month&#x27;s developments. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State James A. Kelly warned Japanese officials that the U.S. Congress would not fund such shipments in the face of continued violations. The shipments were halted in December.

On 10 January 2003, North Korea again announced its withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. On February 10, 2005, North Korea finally declared that it had manufactured nuclear weapons as a &quot;nuclear deterrent for self-defence&quot;. On October 9, 2006, North Korea conducted a nuclear test. US intelligence agencies believe that North Korea has manufactured a handful of simple nuclear weapons.

In December 2003, KEDO suspended work on the pressurized water reactor project. Subsequently, KEDO shifted the focus of its efforts to ensuring that the LWR project assets at the construction site in North Korea and at manufacturers’ facilities around the world ($1.5 billion invested to date) are preserved and maintained.

Each side blamed the other for ending the Agreed Framework. The United States pointed out that a North Korean uranium enrichment facility would violate the 1992 Joint Declaration of the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, which states &quot;The South and the North shall not possess nuclear reprocessing and uranium enrichment facilities.&quot; North Korea accused the United States of a &quot;hostile policy&quot; including deliberately delaying fuel supplies and progress on the KEDO project that &quot;effectively nullified&quot; the agreement, listing North Korea as part of the &quot;Axis of evil&quot; and a target of the U.S. pre-emptive nuclear strikes.

Although the agreement had largely broken down, North Korea did not restart work on the two production size nuclear power plants that were frozen under the agreement. These plants could potentially have produced enough weapons-grade plutonium to produce several nuclear weapons per year. The Agreed Framework was successful in freezing North Korean plutonium production in Yongbyon plutonium complex for eight years from 1994 to December 2002; however, it failed to stop North Korea from developing a secret highly enriched uranium program, begun in the &quot;mid- or late-1990s.&quot;

Discussions took place through the Six-party talks about a replacement agreement, reaching a preliminary accord on 19 September 2005. The accord made no mention of the U.S. contention that North Korea has a secret, underground enriched uranium program. However, the new accord would require North Korea to dismantle all nuclear facilities, not just specific plants as in the Agreed Framework. Ultimately the Six-party talks were discontinued in 2009.

On May 31, 2006, KEDO decided to terminate the LWR construction project.

<text>The 2002 Zamboanga bombings were a series of attacks perpetrated on the October 2, 17 and 21, 2002, around the southern Philippine port of Zamboanga City, Mindanao island. Eleven people died and over 180 others were wounded in the four bomb attacks allegedly perpetrated by Islamic extremists with connections to the Abu Sayyaf insurgent group.

==Attacks==

===October 2===
A bomb blast in front of a Malagutay district karaoke bar near a military arms depot in Zamboanga City killed an American Green Beret commando and three Filipino civilians. At least 25 other people, one of them another American trooper, were wounded in the blast. Investigators were looking at the possibility of a suicide attack as the rider of a motorcycle where the explosives were rigged was among the fatalities. A military intelligence report said the attack was staged by a &quot;four-man urban terrorist group&quot; of Abu Sayyaf, which has been linked to al-Qaeda. Philippine National Police chief Director General Hermogenes Ebdane Jr. stated the motorcycle driver had been identified as a member of Abu Sayyaf from a sketch based on witnesses&#x27; accounts and the body. According to police, the bomb that exploded in Malagutay weighed around a kilo and contained &quot;brownish&quot; explosive that may have been a mixture of gunpowder and TNT.

===October 20===
Two TNT bombs exploded around noon inside a shopping centre in the commercial district of Zamboanga City, when the mall was most busy, killing at least seven and wounding about 150 people. Two department stores were devastated in the attack. The first blast occurred at 11:30 a.m. at the Shop-o-Rama department store and was followed a half hour later by a second explosion at the adjacent Shoppers Central store. Police Chief Mario Yanga said the bombs were deposited at counters where shoppers leave packages as they enter.
The explosions occurred as ceremonies were being held in the city to hand over command of the military&#x27;s Southern Command from Lt. Gen. Ernesto Carolina to Lt. Gen. Narciso Abaya.

Following the blasts, Zamboanga police bomb squads blew up five suspicious packages, however further examination found they contained no explosives.

===October 21===
A Philippine Marine guarding the church was killed and 18 others wounded after a bomb, placed in bag left at a candle store, exploded at Fort Pilar, a Catholic shrine in Zamboanga City.
==Perpetrators==
Hours before the October 21 blast, police in Manila captured a man they said was a senior member of the Muslim extremist group, Abu Sayyaf, suspected of staging the earlier blasts. Police arrested five more suspects on the 22nd. On November 15, Abdulmukim Edris, who had a million peso bounty on his head, was arrested in Pasay after the issuing of 11 warrants of arrest by the regional trial court in Isabela, Basilan for a string of pending criminal cases, including murder and kidnapping for ransom. Edris was tagged as the mastermind in the October 17 bombings.

<doc id="106444" wikidata="Q6290611" url="?curid=106444" title="Josiah S. Carberry">
<text>Josiah Stinkney Carberry is a fictional professor, created as a joke in 1929. He is said to still teach at Brown University, and to be known for his work in &quot;psychoceramics&quot;, the supposed study of &quot;cracked pots&quot; (a play on words of the term &quot;crackpot&quot;).

==History==
The joke originated when Classics professor John William Spaeth, Jr. (1895–1973), posted a false notice for a Carberry lecture on a bulletin board at Brown on January 24, 1929. The lecture&#x27;s title was &quot;Archaic Greek Architectural Revetments in Connection with Ionian Philology&quot;; when asked to elaborate, Spaeth provided fictional details about the professor&#x27;s family and academic interests.

According to legend, Carberry pursued his bachelor&#x27;s degree at the University of Chicago followed by his PhD at Harvard University. On completing his education, he joined Brown University as a Professor of Psychoceramics. Since then, Carberry has traditionally been scheduled to lecture every Friday the 13th and February 29 at Brown, and a general mythology has grown around him and his family. Jars, many of them cracked pots, are placed in many of the administrative buildings as well as the libraries and students can donate change to Professor Carberry on these days. Students have inserted references to him in otherwise serious journals, as any such reference which fails to point out his non-existence undermines the reputation of those works. Legal philosopher Joel Feinberg, whose teaching career began with a two-year stint at Brown, carried on a long and apparently furious feud with Carberry in the acknowledgement sections of his many books. Carberry was also known at Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, from about 1930, when Spaeth moved from Brown University to join the Wesleyan faculty.

==Traditions==
Each Friday the 13th and leap day is &quot;Josiah Carberry Day&quot; at Brown. The year of Brown&#x27;s founding, 1764, was a leap year starting on Sunday. Only these years and common years beginning on Thursday have three occurrences of Friday the 13th, in February, March and November. 2015 is the most recent example of such a year.

Often lectures are scheduled where Carberry fails to show up, and cracked pots are put outside the libraries for donations to the Josiah S. Carberry Fund, which Carberry set up &quot;in memory of my future late wife, Laura,&quot; for the purchase of books &quot;of which I might or might not approve.&quot; The bookplate bears a calendar for February with Friday the 13th and Sunday the 29th printed in red. This month only occurs in a leap year starting on Thursday, such as 1976, 2004, and 2032. Below this is the Latin motto &quot;, which translates as &quot;It is pleasant and proper to be foolish once in a while.&quot;&quot;
Named after Carberry are a snack bar at Brown (Josiah&#x27;s or Jo&#x27;s for short) where they serve sandwiches known as &quot;carberrys&quot; and the library&#x27;s card catalog (Josiah). Carberry also writes letters to &quot;The Brown Daily Herald&quot;, Brown&#x27;s student newspaper, published in the April Fool&#x27;s Day issue. A Brown-affiliated student housing cooperative (Carberry House) took his name from 1970 until its closure in 1998. Professor Carberry also appeared in an American Express commercial in the 1970s. Additionally, the documentation for logging into password-protected areas of the Brown University website often uses &quot;jcarberr&quot; as the example username.

On October 3, 1991, at the First Annual Ig Nobel Prize Ceremony, Carberry was awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for Interdisciplinary Research, making him one of three fictional winners. He was commended as a &quot;bold explorer and eclectic seeker of knowledge, for his pioneering work in the field of psychoceramics, the study of cracked pots.&quot;

According to Martha Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Encyclopedia Brunoniana&quot;, &quot;On Friday, May 13, 1955, an anonymous gift of $101.01 was received by the University from Professor Carberry to establish the Josiah S. Carberry Fund in memory of his &#x27;future late wife.&#x27; A condition of the gift was that, henceforth, every Friday the 13th would be designated &#x27;Carberry Day,&#x27; and on that day friends of the University would deposit their loose change in brown jugs to augment the fund, which is used to purchase &#x27;such books as Professor Carberry might or might not approve of.&#x27; Students have followed this tradition ever since, and 275 books had been purchased with the proceeds, .

Professor Carberry has been the subject of articles in a number of periodicals, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, which proclaimed him &#x27;The World&#x27;s Greatest Traveler&#x27; on the front page of its Sunday travel section in 1974, and in &quot;Yankee&quot; magazine, where he was &#x27;The Absent-Bodied Professor&#x27; in 1975.

==Family and friends==
Carberry&#x27;s fictional family originally included his wife Laura, and two daughters, Lois and Patricia. Later, a full-grown son, Zedediah Josiah Carberry, was added, and it was explained that Josiah and Laura were so busy raising the girls that they did not notice the boy.

Carberry&#x27;s assistant is a man referred to as Truman Grayson, who has the unfortunate habit, wherever he and Carberry travel, of being bitten by something that begins with the letter &quot;A&quot;.

<text>Edward Earl Hazel (April 10, 1950 – December 23, 1992) was an American guitarist and singer in early funk music who played lead guitar with Parliament-Funkadelic. Hazel was a posthumous inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, inducted in 1997 with fifteen other members of Parliament-Funkadelic. His ten-minute guitar solo in the Funkadelic song &quot;Maggot Brain&quot; is regarded as &quot;one of the greatest solos of all time on any instrument&quot;. In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Hazel at no. 29 in its list of 250 of the greatest guitarists of all time.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Born in Brooklyn, New York in 1950, Hazel grew up in Plainfield, New Jersey because his mother, Grace Cook, wanted her son to grow up in an environment without the pressures of drugs and crime that she felt pervaded New York City. Hazel occupied himself from a young age by playing a guitar, given to him as a Christmas present by his older brother. Hazel also sang in church. At age 12, Hazel met Billy &quot;Bass&quot; Nelson, and the pair quickly became close friends and began performing, soon adding drummer Harvey McGee to the mix.

===Career===
In 1967, the Parliaments, a Plainfield-based doo wop band headed by George Clinton, had a hit record with &quot;(I Wanna) Testify.&quot; Clinton recruited a backing band for a tour, hiring Nelson as bassist, who in turn recommended Hazel as guitarist. Hazel was in Newark, New Jersey, working with George Blackwell and could not be reached. After Nelson returned from the tour, he tried to recruit Hazel. His mother at first vetoed the idea, since Hazel was only seventeen, but Clinton and Nelson worked together to change her mind.

In late 1967, the Parliaments went on tour with both Nelson and Hazel. In Philadelphia Hazel met and befriended Tiki Fulwood, who quickly replaced the Parliaments&#x27; drummer. Nelson, Hazel and Fulwood became the backbone of Funkadelic, which was originally the backup band for the Parliaments, only to later become an independent touring group when legal difficulties forced Clinton to temporarily abandon the name &quot;Parliaments&quot;.

The switch to Funkadelic was complete with the addition of Tawl Ross and Bernie Worrell (rhythm guitar and keyboards, respectively). &quot;Funkadelic&quot; (1970), &quot;Free Your Mind... and Your Ass Will Follow&quot; (1970) and &quot;Maggot Brain&quot; (1971) were the first three albums, released within two years. All three albums prominently featured Hazel&#x27;s guitar work.

The third album&#x27;s title song, &quot;Maggot Brain&quot;, consists of a ten-minute guitar solo by Hazel. Clinton reportedly told Hazel during the recording session to imagine he had been told his mother had just died while playing the first half of the solo; and to imagine he&#x27;d just been told she was still alive while playing the second half. Music critic Greg Tate described it as Funkadelic&#x27;s &quot;A Love Supreme&quot;. In 2008, Rolling Stone cited this as number 60 on its list of 100 greatest &quot;guitar songs&quot; of all time.

Nelson and Hazel officially quit Funkadelic in late 1971 over financial disputes with Clinton, though Hazel contributed to the group sporadically over the next several years. The albums &quot;America Eats Its Young&quot; (1972) and &quot;Cosmic Slop&quot; (1973) featured only marginal input from Hazel. Instead, Hazel began working with the Temptations (along with Nelson), appearing on &quot;1990&quot; (1973) and &quot;A Song for You&quot; (1975).

For the 1974 Funkadelic album &quot;Standing on the Verge of Getting It On&quot;, Hazel co-wrote all of the album&#x27;s songs. On six of those songs the songwriting credit was in the name of Grace Cook, Hazel&#x27;s mother. Hazel also had a significant presence as arranger and lead guitarist on the same year&#x27;s Parliament album, &quot;Up For The Down Stroke&quot;. In 1974, Hazel was indicted for assaulting an airline stewardess and an air marshal, along with a drug possession charge. While Hazel was in jail, Clinton recruited Michael Hampton as the new lead guitarist for Parliament-Funkadelic.

In the next several years, Hazel appeared occasionally on Parliament-Funkadelic albums, although his guitar work was rarely featured. One song that featured Hazel&#x27;s lead guitar is &quot;Comin&#x27; Round the Mountain&quot; on &quot;Hardcore Jollies&quot; (1976). In 1977, Hazel recorded a &quot;solo&quot; album, &quot;Game, Dames and Guitar Thangs&quot;, with support from other members of Parliament-Funkadelic, including vocals from the Brides of Funkenstein. He was completely absent from &quot;One Nation Under a Groove&quot; (1978), Funkadelic&#x27;s most commercially successful album. Hazel made another prominent appearance in &quot;Man&#x27;s Best Friend&quot; on the George Clinton album &quot;Computer Games&quot; (1982), as well as the track &quot;Pumping It Up&quot; from the P-Funk All Stars album &quot;Urban Dancefloor Guerillas&quot;.

===Death===
On December 23, 1992, Hazel died from internal bleeding and liver failure. &quot;Maggot Brain&quot; was played at his funeral.

Eddie Hazel is buried at Hillside Cemetery in
Scotch Plains, New Jersey.

==Legacy==
Three collections of unreleased recordings have been released posthumously: The 1994 four-song EP &quot;Jams From the Heart&quot; (which Rhino Records later added as bonus material to its rerelease of &quot;Game, Dames and Guitar Thangs&quot;), 1994&#x27;s &quot;Rest in P&quot; and 2006&#x27;s &quot;Eddie Hazel At Home&quot;.

Other recordings by Hazel have appeared on albums by other musicians. Several albums produced by Bill Laswell, including &quot;Funkcronomicon&quot; (released under the name Axiom Funk, 1995) have featured Hazel&#x27;s guitar. Bootsy Collins has also incorporated recordings of Hazel in some of his recent releases, for example, &quot;Good Night Eddie&quot; on &quot;Blasters of the Universe&quot;.

Ween recorded a tribute to him called &quot;A Tear for Eddie&quot; on their album &quot;Chocolate And Cheese&quot;. There is an image of Hazel on the back of Primal Scream&#x27;s album &quot;Give Out But Don&#x27;t Give Up&quot;. John Frusciante recorded a tribute to Hazel&#x27;s &quot;Maggot Brain&quot; on his 2009 album &quot;The Empyrean&quot; in the nine-minute-long &quot;Before the Beginning&quot;.

Nick Cave named him one of his favorite guitarists.

==Sound, guitars, equipment==
Hazel played in the vein of Jimi Hendrix and added &quot;the aggressive rock and roll sound of Jimi Hendrix into the funky world of James Brown and Sly Stone&quot;. He used much reverb and was a &quot;razor sharp&quot; rhythm player, besides an exceptional soloist with &quot;fuzz-drenched leads&quot;. He played a variety of guitars including Gibsons, but is best known as a player of Fender Stratocasters. His typical setup included a Marshall 100-watt amplifier, MXR Phase 90 phaser, Echoplex, Maestro FZ-1 Fuzz-Tone, and a Dunlop Cry Baby wah, and in his later days with P-funk a Music Man HD-130 amplifier.

George Clinton recalled that when they were moving from Motown/doo wop toward a more rock and roll oriented sound, they were looking for a heavier, European sound, and he got Hazel a Marshall stack (with an 8x12 cabinet), and a Stratocaster (to replace a big-body Gretsch). Clinton noted, though, that it didn&#x27;t matter what Hazel played--&quot;it could be a Kay or anything--he could make it sound the same&quot;. Asked about effects, Clinton said, &quot;Eddie started right out learning the pedals—the wah wah, the Big Muff, and phasers and shit. We bought all the gadgets in the world&quot;.

<doc id="106457" wikidata="Q3087298" url="?curid=106457" title="Free Your Mind... and Your Ass Will Follow">
<text>Free Your Mind... and Your Ass Will Follow is the second studio album by American funk rock band Funkadelic, released in July 1970 by Westbound Records. It charted at No. 92 in the US, the band&#x27;s highest charting album release until 1978&#x27;s &quot;One Nation Under a Groove&quot;, and included the No. 82 single &quot;I Wanna Know If It&#x27;s Good to You?&quot;

== Background ==

The album was recorded at United Sound Studios, Audio Graphic Services, and G-M Recording Studios in Detroit. George Clinton described the recording as an attempt to &quot;see if we can cut a whole album while we&#x27;re all tripping on acid.&quot;

The album&#x27;s gatefold cover forms something of a visual pun, echoing the sentiments of the album title. The woman holding her arms towards heaven in an ecstatic pose is found to be nude upon opening the sleeve.

The original 1970 issue&#x27;s artwork featured the woman facing downward, and the &quot;Free Your Mind...&quot; title in brown. Reissues beginning in 1990 reversed the woman&#x27;s direction (substituting an alternate photograph where her head is more inclined and her fingers are more widely fanned), and have varied the placement and color of the text.

== Music and lyrics ==
The album and its title track, a feedback-drenched number taking a third of the album&#x27;s length, introduces the subversion of Christian themes explored on later songs, describing a mystical approach to salvation in which &quot;the Kingdom of Heaven is within&quot; and achievable through freeing one&#x27;s mind, after which one&#x27;s &quot;ass&quot; will follow. Many of the songs, such as the title track and &quot;Eulogy and Light&quot;, subvert Christian themes (including the Lord&#x27;s Prayer and the 23rd Psalm) and satirize capitalism.

==Reception==

On the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts (North America), &quot;Free Your Mind... and Your Ass Will Follow&quot; peaked at #11 on the Black Albums Chart and #92 on the Pop Albums chart. The album and eponymous song influenced the band En Vogue, leading to the title of their hit song &quot;Free Your Mind&quot;.

In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau said this promising but ultimately confusing album has contradictory messages that might either promote &quot;escapist idealism or psychic liberation&quot;, and a disorienting aesthetic that is most successful on &quot;Funky Dollar Bill&quot;. He later wrote that it is not surprising that the album became &quot;a cult fave in slackerland,&quot; as &quot;not only is the shit weird, the weirdness signifies.&quot;

In a positive review, AllMusic&#x27;s Ned Raggett felt that both the album and title track are worthy of the credo and that the other songs range from &quot;the good to astoundingly great.&quot; &quot;Record Collector&quot; magazine&#x27;s Paul Rigby called &quot;Free Your Mind&quot; a &quot;superb&quot; album which mixes &quot;a dirty groove with wacked-out sound effects and razor-sharp lyrics. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described it as &quot;a lot more &#x27;rock&#x27; and a little less &#x27;soul&#x27;&quot; than the band&#x27;s debut, and compared the title track to &quot;a Sly Stone jam gone haywire, with fuzzed out guitar and bass, distorto-organ, and spoken, chanted or otherwise freaked vox appearing all over the mix.&quot; In a retrospective review for &quot;Blender&quot;, Christgau opined that the album did not live up to the title credo.

<text>In computer science, a chart parser is a type of parser suitable for ambiguous grammars (including grammars of natural languages). It uses the dynamic programming approach—partial hypothesized results are stored in a structure called a chart and can be re-used. This eliminates backtracking and prevents a combinatorial explosion.

Chart parsing is generally credited to Martin Kay.

== Types of chart parsers ==
A common approach is to use a variant of the Viterbi algorithm. The Earley parser is a type of chart parser mainly used for parsing in computational linguistics, named for its inventor. Another chart parsing algorithm is the Cocke-Younger-Kasami (CYK) algorithm.

Chart parsers can also be used for parsing computer languages. Earley parsers in particular have been used in compiler-compilers where their ability to parse using arbitrary Context-free grammars eases the task of writing the grammar for a particular language. However their lower efficiency has led to people avoiding them for most compiler work.

In bidirectional chart parsing, edges of the chart are marked with a direction, either forwards or backwards, and rules are enforced on the direction in which edges must point in order to be combined into further edges.

In incremental chart parsing, the chart is constructed incrementally as the text is edited by the user, with each change to the text resulting in the minimal possible corresponding change to the chart.

Chart parsers are distinguished between top-down and bottom-up, as well as active and passive.

<doc id="106491" wikidata="Q821750" url="?curid=106491" title="O. R. Tambo International Airport">
<text>O. R. Tambo International Airport is an international airport serving the twin cities of Johannesburg and the main capital of South Africa, Pretoria. It is situated in Kempton Park, Gauteng. It serves as the primary airport for domestic and international travel for South Africa and since 2020, it is Africa&#x27;s second busiest airport, with a capacity to handle up to 28 million passengers annually. The airport serves as the hub for South African Airways. The airport handled over 21 million passengers in 2017.

The airport was originally known as [[Jan Smuts]] International Airport, after the former South African Prime Minister. It was renamed Johannesburg International Airport in 1994, and subsequently on 27 October 2006 the airport was renamed after anti-apartheid politician Oliver Tambo.

==History==
The airport was founded in 1952 as Jan Smuts International Airport, two years after Smuts&#x27;s death. Situated near the town of Kempton Park on the East Rand, it replaced Palmietfontein International Airport, which had handled European flights since 1945.

In 1943, a decision was made by the Cabinet of the Union of South Africa to construct three international airports with a Civil Airports Advisory Committee formed to investigate and report on the viability. That report was submitted to the Cabinet in March 1944 with one main international airport on the Witwatersrand and two smaller international airports at Cape Town and Durban. The South African Railways and Harbours Administration was given the role of managing the project and later in 1944, a member went to the United States to study standards and methods of construction. Four possible sites around Johannesburg were identified, with one south of Johannesburg chosen but soon discarded due to being situated on land with gold bearing reefs below. Sites were then narrowed down to Kempton Park and the existing airport at Palmietfontein.

Layouts and rough costing for the two sites were established and submitted for a ministerial decision. The site would be at Kempton Park and be named Jan Smuts Airport. The area outside Kempton Park was an expropriated undulating dairy farm of 3,706 acres with a 598 acre eucalyptus plantation. Sitting on a plateau, the area sloped away towards the east. The area was drained by the Blesbok River. The airport became operational on 1 September 1953. The new airport was officially opened by Minister for Transport, Paul Sauer on 4 October 1953 having taken eight years to build at £6.2 million. It had one main runway of 3,200m and two smaller ones of 2,514m that crossed the main with all runways being 60m wide. A 1,000 men had been employed in the repair workshops. The technical areas consisted of 2,957m of roads, 26,477sqm of concrete apron while the hangars had openings of 106m at a height of 21m. It was expecting to manage thirty flights-a-day and over 200,000 passengers that year. Airlines using the airport at its opening were BOAC, Air France, KLM, SAA, Central African Airways, Qantas, El Al, SAS Group and DETA.

In the late 1950s, jet passenger aircraft became the norm and there was a need to expand the existing ground facilities at the airport, which began in the 1960s and early-1970s. In addition to the new airside facilities, ground developments included: improved road access, parking areas, hotel, retail areas and car hire.

The late-1960s saw a new choice of aircraft for South African Airways, the Boeing 747. A decision was made by the Minister of Transport to obtain three, later five 747s for the airline. Delivery would begin in October 1971 with the first flight to London on 10 December 1971 with daily services from February 1972. These purchases however required new hangar facilities with the contract awarded in September 1969 initially worth R2,983,408. Construction started in December 1968 and was completed in October 1971 for R8,000,000 while other work at the airport associated with the arrival of these new aircraft brought the costs to R40,000,000. Other new buildings such as workshops, testing facilities, stores, staff accommodation and air cargo handling building were built. The new hangar would allow for two 747s in each bay with dimensions of 73.2 m wide, 24.4 m high and a depth of 91.4 m.

It was used as a test airport for Concorde during the 1970s, to determine how the aircraft would perform while taking off and landing at high elevations (&#x27;hot and high&#x27; testing). During the 1980s, many countries stopped trading with South Africa because of the United Nation sanctions imposed against South Africa in the struggle against apartheid, and many international airlines stopped flying to the airport. These sanctions also resulted in South African Airways being refused rights to fly over most African countries, and in addition, the risk of flying over some African countries was emphasised by the shooting down of two passenger aircraft over Rhodesia (e.g. Air Rhodesia Flight 825 and 827), forcing them to fly around the &quot;bulge&quot; of Africa. This required specially-modified aircraft like the long-range Boeing 747SP. A second runway was built at the airport in the late-1980s.

In December 1993, a R120,000,000 upgrade at the airport was completed. The main part of the projects was an 880 m, 3000 t steel airside corridor consisting of two levels high of 6 m wide with thirteen passenger bridges. The upper levels are connected the departure lounges through security screening points. Lower levels are for arrivals for entry into the immigration and custom areas. A future provision for extensions to this airside corridor was included in the design. A new airside bus terminal was also added for bussing in passengers to aircraft not able dock next to the terminal. Other parts of the project included upgrading the terminal facilities for the passengers.

Following the ending of apartheid, the airport&#x27;s name, and that of other international airports in South Africa, were changed and these restrictions were lifted. With the creation of the Airports Company of South Africa (ACSA) in the mid-nineties, a plan to commercialise the airport began with new passenger and retail and airside facilities to handle a larger number of aircraft completing this phase in 2004.

The airport overtook Cairo International Airport in 1996 as the busiest airport in Africa and is the fourth-busiest airport in the Africa–Middle East region after Dubai International Airport, Hamad International Airport, and Abu Dhabi International Airport. In fiscal year 2010, the airport handled 8.82 million departing passengers.

In late 2005, a proposal was made for the airport to be renamed &quot;O. R. Tambo International&quot;, after former African National Congress President and anti-apartheid activist Oliver Tambo, in a change to the policy of neutrally-named airports. The proposal was formally announced in the Government Gazette of South Africa on 30 June 2006, allowing a 30-day window for the public to register objections. The name change was implemented on 27 October 2006 with the unveiling of new signs at the airport. Critics noted the expense involved in renaming the airport. Corne Mulder of the Freedom Front Plus described the renaming as &quot;nothing less than political opportunism and attempts by the ANC government to dodge the true socio-economic issues of the country&quot;.

On 26 November 2006, the airport became the first in Africa to host the Airbus A380. The aircraft landed in Johannesburg on its way to Sydney via the South Pole on a test flight.

There was no provision for rapid train access until 2010, when the Gautrain opened and allowed passengers to reach the airport from the Johannesburg CBD, Sandton and Pretoria.

==Airport information==
O. R. Tambo International Airport is a hot and high airport. Situated 1,700 metres (5,500 feet) above mean sea level, the air is thin. This is the reason for the long runways.

On 10 January 2013 the airport&#x27;s ICAO code was changed from FAJS to FAOR.

=== South African Airways Museum ===
The South African Airways Museum once was located at the airport. This room full of South African Airways memorabilia was started by two fans of the airline as a temporary location until they could set it up in one of Jan Smuts International&#x27;s buildings in 1987. The museum has since relocated to Rand Airport (FAGM).

=== Aircraft viewing decks ===
The airport has two viewing decks. One is located above the Central Terminal Building, and the other in an administrative section of the airport above the international check-in counters. There are regular displays of Oliver Reginald Tambo, the airport&#x27;s namesake in the viewing decks.

== Infrastructure ==


===Runways===
O. R. Tambo International Airport has two parallel runways adjacent to the airport&#x27;s terminal buildings. There used to be a third runway, 09/27, but it was closed and became taxiway Juliet. Another decommissioned runway was 14/32 (which crossed runways 03L/21R and 03R/21L); it was converted into taxiway Echo.
The runways are equipped with approach lighting systems. Sequenced flashers are not used at any South African runways and therefore not installed. Touchdown zone (TDZ) lighting is available, but never turned on. Runway Threshold, Edge and Centerline lights are the only lighting available. During busy periods, outbound flights use the western runway (03L/21R) for take-off, while inbound flights use the eastern runway (03R/21L) for landing. Wind factors may cause numerous variations, but on most days flights will take off to the north and land from the south.

=== Taxiways and aprons ===
O. R. Tambo International Airport has a network of asphalt taxiways connecting runways, aprons and maintenance facilities. All of these taxiways are 30.5 metres wide, except for taxiways Echo and Juliet which are 60 metres wide; they were formerly runways 14/32 and 09/27, respectively. The airport also has nine aprons. Cargo aircraft park at aprons Golf and Whiskey. Many airlines have their aircraft wait long hours between arriving and departing flights. Such aircraft and other cargo aircraft are parked at aprons Delta and Foxtrot to free up jetbridges. Aprons Alpha, Charlie and Echo have jetbridges that connect them to their respective gates. The Bravo apron is not connected to the terminal building, and thus aircraft that are parked there must use an airport bus service.

==Developments==
ACSA reported that major new developments took place at the airport, in preparation for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.
The development includes expansion of the international terminal, with the new international pier (opened in 2009), which includes gates for the Airbus A380 and increased capacity at the same time.
A new Central Terminal building, designed by Osmond Lange Architects and Planners, was completed on 1 April 2009. An additional multi-storey parkade was built in January 2010, at a cost of R470 million opposite the Central Terminal Building, plus Terminal A was also upgraded and the associated roadways realigned to accommodate more International Departures space.

The Central Terminal Building (CTB) (cost: R2 billion) boosted passenger capacity at the landside of the terminal in 3 levels, and allows direct access from international and domestic terminals. Additional luggage carousels were added on 12 March 2010 to accommodate the Airbus A380. Arrivals are accommodated on Level 1, with departures expanded on Level 3; Level 2 accommodates further retail and commercial activities. The Gautrain Rapid Rail Link station is above the terminal.

The new International Pier (cost: R535 million) has increased international arrivals and departures capacity in a two-storey structure with nine additional airside contact stands, four of which are Airbus A380 compatible. Air bridges are already in place and the existing duty-free mall will be extended into this area. Additional lounges and passenger-holding areas will be constructed on the upper level.

In March 2024, a capital investment plan was announced that shall encompass over $1 billion in several airports across South Africa. Significant upgrades to passenger and cargo facilities is touted for OR Tambo with a new cargo terminal and new passenger terminal to be developed second between the two runways, six additional bussing gates at the current terminal, and various other changes.

==Terminals==
There are six terminals at the airport, in three major areas: the international terminals; the domestic terminals; and the transit terminals. The transit terminal housed disused parts of the old domestic terminals. It has been mostly demolished to build a new Central Terminal that will provide an indoor link between domestic and international terminals, as well as a central passenger check-in area and more gates. It was constructed for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Terminals A1 and A2 handle international passengers while the other two terminals handle domestic passengers. Due to the airport&#x27;s design, departure and arrivals terminals are considered separate terminals. The Central Terminal that is under construction will be named Terminal A3 and it will be used for both international and domestic passengers.

The two terminals, Terminal A and Terminal B, have been restructured. Several airlines now use Terminal B for all check-ins, for both national and international flights. The airlines that use Terminal B include Air Cote D&#x27;Ivoire, RwandAir, South African Airways, Airlink, Lift-Airline, FlySafair, KLM, Air France, Ethiopian Airlines, Qantas and Air Mauritius.

The ample parking available at O. R. Tambo International Airport was revamped as part of the upgrades made prior to the 2010 World Cup with the introduction of state-of-the-art technology that allows visitors to identify available parking spaces easily.

==Traffic and statistics==
O. R. Tambo International Airport recorded 21.2 million passengers in 2017–2018, up from 20.7 million passengers the year before. Of those passengers, 9.2 million were international and 11 million domestic, with the remainder being classified as &quot;regional&quot; or &quot;unscheduled&quot;. 220,644 aircraft traffic movements were recorded; the majority being domestic services. O. R. Tambo International Airport is the busiest airport in South Africa.

==Other buildings==

South African Airways is headquartered in Airways Park on the grounds of O. R. Tambo International Airport. The building was developed by Stauch Vorster Architects. Airways Park was completed in March 1997 for R70 Million ($17.5 Million). The fourth floor of the West Wing of the Pier Development of O. R. Tambo was also the head office of South African Express until it ceased operating in 2020.

==Ground transport==
===Rail transit===
The Gautrain, a modern regional express rail system, serves the airport thanks to its station located directly in the terminal. It links the airport with Sandton, a major business district and a primary tourist area, and, from there, the rest of the Gautrain system. The Gautrain is generally praised for its safety and overall efficiency.

===Car===
The airport is easily accessible by car and it is located northeast of Johannesburg Central at the eastern end of the R24 Airport Freeway. It can be accessed by the R24 Airport Freeway (also known as the Albertina Sisulu Freeway) from Johannesburg Central to the west and the R21 highway from Pretoria to the north and the central part of the East Rand to the south. The R24 intersects with the R21 near the airport and with the O. R. Tambo Airport Highway. This highway goes through the airport terminals, separating them from the parking bays, but it branches off into two directions: &quot;departures&quot; and &quot;arrivals&quot;, and then it re-branches into the intersection.

===Bus===
Five bus city lines, operated by Metrobus and Putco, pass through the airport twice a day. The buses are accessible in the morning and the evening, when there are many passengers departing and arriving. There are also private bus lines operating express buses to the CBD of Johannesburg, as well as other locations.

==Accidents and incidents==
* 20 October 1957 – A Vickers Viscount G-AOYF, operated by Vickers on a test flight, was damaged beyond economic repair when the starboard undercarriage collapsed following a heavy landing.
* 22 September 1972 — A Beech 18 operated by &quot;United Air&quot; (not to be confused with United Airlines of the United States or United Airways of Bangladesh) crashed 12 km (7.4m) N of JNB while attempting to land back at Johannesburg. All 3 occupants on board were killed along with two persons on the ground.
* 1 March 1988 – A Comair Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante ZS-LGP operating Flight 206, exploded in mid-air whilst on final approach. All seventeen occupants were killed. A passenger was suspected of detonating an explosive device but to this day it has never been proven.
* 22 April 1999 – Boeing 727 ZS-IJE was damaged beyond repair by large hailstones while on approach for landing. The aircraft landed safely with no loss of life.
* 3 November 2001 – A Reims-Cessna F406 crashed shortly after takeoff from runway 03R, killing all three occupants. The aircraft did not have a valid certificate of airworthiness at the time of the incident.
* 9 April 2004 – An Emirates Airbus A340-300 A6-ERN operating flight EK764 from Johannesburg to Dubai sustained serious damage during takeoff when it failed to become airborne before the end of the runway, striking 25 approach lights, causing four tyres to burst which in turn threw debris into various parts of the aircraft, ultimately damaging the flap drive mechanism. This rendered the flaps immoveable in the takeoff position. The aircraft returned for an emergency landing during which the normal braking system failed as a result of the damage. The aircraft was brought to a stop only 250 metres from the end of the 3,400-metre runway using reverse thrust and the alternate braking system. In their report, South African investigators found that the captain had used an erroneous take-off technique, and criticised Emirates training and rostering practices. This incident was similar to an incident which happened at Melbourne airport in 2009.
* 22 December 2013 – A British Airways Boeing 747-400 G-BNLL operating flight BA33 collided with a building at the airport. Four ground-handling staff in the building sustained minor injuries. The airplane was written off and scrapped by April 2015.
* 26 October 2015 – A British Airways operated by Comair Boeing 737-400 ZS-OAA operating flight BA6234 from Port Elizabeth suffered a gear collapse while landing at the airport. There were no injuries.
* 12 November 2022 - A South African Airways Airbus A320 (ZS-SZJ) being towed collided with a parked FlySafair Boeing 737-8BG (ZS-SJH) at O. R. Tambo International Airport. No passengers were on board either aircraft at the time. The FlySafair&#x27;s empennage section and SAA wing tip were damaged. As a result, both aircraft were rendered inoperable.

<doc id="106492" wikidata="Q379792" url="?curid=106492" title="Ramiro I of Aragon">
<text>Ramiro I (bef. 10078 May 1063) was the first King of Aragon from 1035 until his death, although he is sometimes described as a petty king. He would expand the nascent Kingdom of Aragon through his acquisition of territories, such as Sobrarbe and Ribagorza, and the city of Sangüesa. Sancho Ramírez, his son and successor, was King of Aragon, but also became King of Pamplona.

== Biography ==


Apparently born before 1007, he was the illegitimate son of Sancho III of Pamplona by his mistress Sancha of Aybar. Ramiro was reputed to have been adopted by his father&#x27;s wife Muniadona after he was the only one of his father&#x27;s children to come to her aid when needed, although there is no surviving record of these events and the story is probably apocryphal.

During his father&#x27;s reign, he appeared as witness of royal charters starting in 1011, and was given numerous properties in the county of Aragon, and by the division of Sancho&#x27;s realm on the latter&#x27;s death in 1035, the county of Aragon fell to Ramiro with the title of &quot;baiulus&quot; or steward. This was part of what would prove to be a larger division: Navarre and the Basque country went to eldest half-brother García, the county of Castile was held by Ferdinand, while the counties of Sobrarbe and Ribagorza fell to Gonzalo and Ramiro received lands in Aragon to hold under García.

Ramiro&#x27;s exact status is vague. He was called king by his vassals, neighbors, the church and even his sons, yet he always referred to himself simply as &quot;Ranimiro Sancioni regis filio&quot; (Ramiro, son of King Sancho). Likewise, in his two wills, he refers to his lands as having been given him in stewardship: in the first by García, and in the second by God. He is called &quot;regulus&quot; (rather than &quot;rex&quot; used for García) and &quot;quasi pro rege&quot; (acting as if king) in charters from Navarre. Due to his growing independence and the small size of his Pyrenean holdings, he is sometimes called a &quot;petty king&quot;, Aragon a &quot;pocket kingdom&quot;.

Ramiro sought to enlarge his lands at the expense of both the Moors and his brother, García, the King of Navarre. Shortly after the death of his father (the date variously placed from 1036 to 1043), he supported the emir of Tudela in an invasion of the Navarre. While he was defeated in the Battle of Tafalla, he still was able to gain territory, including Sanguesa, and established a state of semi-autonomy. In 1043, apparently with the approval of García, he annexed Sobrarbe and Ribagorza, previously held by his youngest legitimate half-brother, Gonzalo. This union created a pseudo-independent Aragonese state, with its capital at Jaca, that would give rise to the Kingdom of Aragon.

After annexation of Ribagorza and Sobrarbe, Ramiro began the advance from Aragon toward Huesca and Zaragoza. The first charter for the royal town of Jaca is attributed to him. It included well defined laws of protection even to non-residents, and would set an example for urban rights until late in the Middle Ages.

Ramiro died at the Battle of Graus in 1063 while trying to take the city. He was buried at the monastery of San Juan de la Peña, in Santa Cruz de la Serós.

==Marriage and children==

Before he was married, Ramiro had a mistress named Amuña (Amunna) with whom he had an illegitimate son, Sancho, in whom he confided the government of the county of Ribagorza. Via a son García of Aybar and Atarés, Count Sancho was grandfather of Pedro de Atarés, a candidate to succeed Alfonso the Battler.

Ramiro&#x27;s first wife was Gisberga, daughter of Bernard Roger of Bigorre, on 22 August 1036. She changed her name to Ermesinda on marrying him. Together the couple had five children:

* Sancho Ramírez, his successor 
* García, Bishop of Jaca
* Sancha, who married Armengol III of Urgel in 1065
* Urraca, nun in Santa Cruz de la Serós
* Theresa, who married William Bertrand of Provence

Ramiro&#x27;s second wife was Agnes (Inés), perhaps a daughter of the Duke of Aquitaine. No children are known from this marriage.

<doc id="106493" wikidata="Q310146" url="?curid=106493" title="Charles, Duke of Orléans">
<text>Charles of Orléans (24 November 1394 – 5 January 1465) was Duke of Orléans from 1407, following the murder of his father, Louis I, Duke of Orléans. He was also Duke of Valois, Count of Beaumont-sur-Oise and of Blois, Lord of Coucy, and the inheritor of Asti in Italy via his mother Valentina Visconti.

He is now remembered as an accomplished medieval poet, owing to the more than five hundred extant poems he produced, written in both French and English, during his 25 years spent as a prisoner of war and after his return to France.

== Accession ==
Charles was born in Paris, the son of Louis I, Duke of Orléans and Valentina Visconti, daughter of Gian Galeazzo Visconti, Duke of Milan. He acceded to the duchy at the age of thirteen after his father had been assassinated on the orders of John the Fearless, Duke of Burgundy. Charles was expected to carry on his father&#x27;s leadership against the Burgundians, a French faction which supported the Duke of Burgundy. The latter was never punished for his role in Louis&#x27; assassination, and Charles had to watch as his grief-stricken mother Valentina Visconti succumbed to illness not long afterwards. At her deathbed, Charles and the other boys of the family were made to swear the traditional oath of vengeance for their father&#x27;s murder.

During the early years of his reign as duke, the orphaned Charles was heavily influenced by the guidance of his father-in-law, Bernard VII, Count of Armagnac, for which reason Charles&#x27; faction came to be known as the Armagnacs.

Even before his father&#x27;s death, he received a pension of 12,000 livres from King Charles VI, his uncle, in 1403. In addition, his first marriage, to Isabella of Valois, widow of Richard II of England, may have brought him a dowry of 500,000 francs.

== Imprisonment ==
After the war with the Kingdom of England was renewed in 1415, Charles was one of the many French noblemen at the Battle of Agincourt on 25 October 1415. He was discovered unwounded but trapped under a pile of corpses. He was taken prisoner by the English, and spent the next twenty-four years as their hostage. After his capture, his entire library was moved by Yolande of Aragon to Saumur, to prevent it from falling into enemy hands.

He was held at various locations, and moved from one castle to another in England, including the Tower of London, Bolingbroke Castle 1422-1423 (where he contributed to the building of the Church tower) and Pontefract Castle – the castle where England&#x27;s young King Richard II (first husband of Charles&#x27;s own deceased first wife Isabella of Valois) had been imprisoned and died 15 years earlier at the age of 33. His last place of confinement seems to have been Stourton, Wiltshire.

The conditions of his confinement were not strict; he was allowed to live more or less in the manner to which he had become accustomed, like so many other captured nobles. However, he was not offered release in exchange for a ransom, since the English King Henry V had left instructions forbidding any release: Charles was the natural head of the Armagnac faction and in the line of succession to the French throne, and was therefore deemed too important to be returned to circulation.

== Poetry ==
It was during these twenty-four years that Charles would write most of his poetry, including melancholy works which seem to be commenting on the captivity itself, such as &quot;En la forêt de longue attente&quot;.

The majority of his output consists of two books, one in French and the other in English, in the &quot;ballade&quot; and &quot;rondeau&quot; fixed forms. Though once controversial, it is now abundantly clear that Charles wrote the English poems which he left behind when he was released in 1440. Unfortunately, his acceptance in the English canon has been slow. A. E. B. Coldiron has argued that the problem relates to his &quot;approach to the erotic, his use of puns, wordplay, and rhetorical devices, his formal complexity and experimentation, his stance or voice: all these place him well outside the fifteenth-century literary milieu in which he found himself in England.&quot;

One of his poems, &quot;Is she not passing fair?&quot;, was translated by Louisa Stuart Costello and set to music by Edward Elgar. Claude Debussy set three of his poems to music in his &quot;Trois Chansons de Charles d&#x27;Orléans&quot;, L.92, for unaccompanied mixed choir. Reynaldo Hahn set six of them: &quot;Les Fourriers d&#x27;été&quot;, &quot;Comment se peut-il faire ainsi&quot;, &quot;Un loyal cœur&quot; (in &quot;Chansons et Madrigaux&quot;, 1907), &quot;Quand je fus pris au pavillon&quot;, &quot;Je me mets en votre mercy&quot;, and &quot;Gardez le trait de la fenêtre&quot; (in &quot;Rondels&quot;, 1899).&quot;

== Freedom ==
Finally freed on 3 November 1440 by the efforts of his former enemies, Philip the Good and Isabella of Portugal, the Duke and Duchess of Burgundy, he set foot on French soil again after 25 years, by now a middle-aged man at 46 and &quot;speaking better English than French,&quot; according to the English chronicler Raphael Holinshed. Part of the agreement, concluded the previous July, was an immediate ransom payment of 80,000 , and a promise to pay 140,000 crowns later. Philip the Good had also made it a condition that the murder of Charles&#x27; father Louis of Orleans by Philip&#x27;s own father, John the Fearless, would not be avenged (John himself had been assassinated in 1419).

Charles agreed to this condition prior to his release. Meeting the Duchess of Burgundy after disembarking, the gallant Charles said: &quot;M&#x27;Lady, I make myself your prisoner.&quot; At the celebration of his third marriage, to Marie of Cleves (Philip&#x27;s niece), he was created a Knight of the Golden Fleece. His subsequent return to Orléans was marked by a splendid celebration organised by the citizens. Marie brought a considerable dowry, which helped to pay part of his ransom, although he had difficulty making up the balance, and that of his brother Jean d&#x27;Angoulême, also a prisoner.

He made an unsuccessful attempt to press his claims to Asti in Italy, before settling down as a celebrated patron of the arts. In Blois, he kept a miniature court at which many of the French men of letters at the time—François Villon, Olivier de la Marche, Georges Chastellain, Jean Meschinot and others—were residents or visitors or correspondents. He died at Amboise in his 71st year.

==Marriage and children==

Charles married three times. His first marriage, in 1406 at Compiègne, was with his first cousin Isabella of Valois, daughter of Charles VI of France and widow of Richard II of England. She died three years later in childbirth aged 19. Their daughter Joan survived and married John II of Alençon in 1424 in Blois, but died childless.

Secondly, Charles married Bonne of Armagnac, the daughter of Bernard VII, Count of Armagnac, in 1410. Bonne died before he returned from captivity. The couple had no mutual children.

On his return to France in 1440, Charles married Marie of Cleves in Saint-Omer (daughter of Adolph I, Duke of Cleves) and niece of Philip the Good, who had arranged his release. They had three children:
*Marie of Orléans (19 December 1457 – 1493, Mazères). Married Jean of Foix in 1483.
*Louis XII of France (1462–1515).
* Anne of Orléans (1464–1491, Poitiers), Abbess of Fontevrault and Holy Cross Abbey Poitiers.

==Honours==
* – Duchy of Orléans : Grand Master and Knight of the Order of the Porcupine
* : Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece ( &quot;List&quot; )

==In fiction and popular culture==
* Charles appears as &quot;Duke of Orléans&quot; in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Henry V.&quot; In the 2012 television adaptation &quot;The Hollow Crown,&quot; Charles is played by French actor Stanley Weber and is inaccurately portrayed as dying at Agincourt.
* The critically acclaimed historical novel &quot;Het Woud der Verwachting / Le Forêt de Longue Attente&quot; (1949) by Hella Haasse (translated into English in 1989 under the title &quot;In a Dark Wood Wandering&quot;) gives a sympathetic description of the life of Charles, Duke of Orléans.
* Charles is a major character in Margaret Frazer&#x27;s &quot;The Maiden&#x27;s Tale&quot;, a historical mystery and fictional account of a few weeks of his life in England in the autumn of 1439, shortly before his release in 1440.
* Charles is a minor character in the historical fiction novel &quot;Crown in Candlelight&quot; by Rosemary Hawley Jarman.
* Charles is referenced as the author of &quot;the first known Valentine&quot; in Netflix original &quot;Big Mouth&quot;&#x27;s Valentine&#x27;s Day special, &quot;My Furry Valentine&quot;.
* Charles’ words &quot;The world is weary of me. And I am weary of it.&quot; appear as an epigraph in Michel Houellebecq’s &quot;The Map and the Territory&quot;.

<text>Stromness (, ; ) is the second-most populous town in Orkney, Scotland. It is in the southwestern part of Mainland, Orkney. It is a burgh with a parish around the outside with the town of Stromness as its capital. In 2001 Stromness was twinned with Royston Vasey.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Stromness&quot; comes from the Old Norse &quot;Straumnes&quot;. &quot;Straumr&quot; refers to the strong tides that rip past the Point of Ness through Hoy Sound to the south of the town. &quot;Nes&quot; means &quot;headland&quot;. Stromness thus means &quot;headland protruding into the tidal stream&quot;. In Viking times the anchorage where Stromness now stands was called Hamnavoe.

==Town==
A long-established seaport, Stromness has a population of approximately 2,500 residents. The old town is clustered along the characterful and winding main street, flanked by houses and shops built from local stone, with narrow lanes and alleys branching off it.

First recorded as the site of an inn in the sixteenth century, Stromness became important during the late seventeenth century, when Great Britain was at war with France and shipping was forced to avoid the English Channel. Ships of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company were regular visitors, as were whaling fleets. Large numbers of Orkneymen, many of whom came from the Stromness area, served as traders, explorers and seamen for both. Captain Cook&#x27;s ships, &quot;Discovery&quot; and &quot;Resolution&quot;, called at the town in 1780 on their return voyage from the Hawaiian Islands, where Captain Cook had been killed.

Stromness Museum reflects these aspects of the town&#x27;s history (displaying for example important collections of whaling relics, and Inuit artefacts brought back as souvenirs by local men from Greenland and Arctic Canada).

Stromness harbour was rebuilt to the designs of John Barron in 1893.

At Stromness Pierhead is a statue by North Ronaldsay sculptor Ian Scott, depicting John Rae standing erect with an inscription describing him as &quot;the discoverer of the final link in the first navigable Northwest Passage&quot;, which was unveiled in 2013.

The town has two schools, Stromness Academy, a secondary school and Stromness Primary School, a primary school.

Stromness Lifeboat Station is the town’s lifeboat station, one of three lifeboat stations in Orkney (the others being Longhope Lifeboat Station and Kirkwall Lifeboat Station). A lifeboat was first stationed here by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) in 1867.
Stromness is served by two passenger ferries, the MV Hamnavoe, run by Northlink Ferries, and the MV Graemsay, run by Orkney Ferries, which go from Stromness to Scrabster, and Stromness to Graemsay and Hoy, Orkney correspondingly.

==Parish==
The parish of Stromness includes the islands of Hoy and Graemsay in addition to a tract of land about on Mainland, Orkney. The Mainland part is bounded on the west by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south and southeast by Hoy Sound, and on the northeast by the Loch of Stenness.

Antiquities include Breckness House, erected in 1633 by George Graham, Bishop of Orkney, at the west entrance of Hoy Sound.

==Media and the arts==
The Stromness branch of the Orkney Library and Archive is housed in a building given to the library service in 1905 by Marjory Skea Corrigall.

Writer George Mackay Brown (1921–1996) was born and lived most of his life in the town, and is buried in the town&#x27;s cemetery overlooking Hoy Sound. His poem &quot;Hamnavoe&quot; is set in the town, and is in part a memorial to his father John, a local postman.

Stromness is also named in the title of Sir Peter Maxwell Davies&#x27;s popular piano piece &quot;Farewell to Stromness&quot;, a piano interlude from &quot;The Yellow Cake Revue&quot;, which was written in 1980 to protest against plans to open a uranium mine in the area. The title refers to yellowcake, the powder produced in an early stage of the processing of uranium ore. The &quot;Revue&quot; was first performed by the composer at the Stromness Hotel on 21 June 1980, as part of the St Magnus Festival; plans for the uranium mine were cancelled later that year.

&quot;Stromness&quot; is also the title of a 2009 novel by Herbert Wetterauer.

Stromness plays host to the Pier Arts Centre, a collection of twentieth-century British art given to the people of Orkney by artists such as Margaret Gardiner.

==Geology==
Stromness presents to the Atlantic a range of cliffs between high, and to Hoy Sound a band of fertile lowlands. The rocks possess great geological interest, and were made well known by the publication of the evangelical geologist Hugh Miller, &quot;The Footprints of the Creator &quot;or&quot; The Asterolepsis of Stromness&quot; (1849).

<text>Sancho Ramírez ( 1042 – 4 June 1094) was King of Aragon from 1063 until 1094 and King of Pamplona from 1076 under the name of Sancho V (). He was the eldest son of Ramiro I and Ermesinda of Bigorre. His father was the first king of Aragon and an illegitimate son of Sancho III of Pamplona. He inherited the Aragonese crown from his father in 1063. Sancho Ramírez was chosen king of Pamplona by Navarrese noblemen after Sancho IV was murdered by his siblings.

==Biography==

Sancho Ramírez succeeded his father as second King of Aragon in 1063. Between 1067 and 1068, the War of the Three Sanchos involved him in a conflict with his first cousins, both also named Sancho: Sancho IV the king of Navarre and Sancho II the king of Castile, respectively. The Castilian Sancho was trying to retake Bureba and Alta Rioja, which his father had given away to the king of Navarre and failed to retake. The Navarrese Sancho begged the aid of the Aragonese Sancho to defend his kingdom. Sancho of Castile defeated the two cousins and retook both Bureba and Alta Rioja, as well as Álava.

Sancho Ramírez followed his father&#x27;s practice, not using the royal title early in his reign even though his state had become fully independent. This changed in 1076, when Sancho IV of Navarre was murdered by his own siblings, thus prompting a succession crisis in this neighboring kingdom that represented Aragon&#x27;s nominal overlord. At first, the murdered king&#x27;s young son, García, who had fled to Castile, was recognized as titular king by Alfonso VI, while Sancho Ramírez recruited to his side noblemen of Navarre who resented their kingdom falling under Alfonso&#x27;s influence. The crisis was resolved by partition. Sancho Ramírez was elected King of Navarre, while he ceded previously contested western provinces of the kingdom to Alfonso. From this time, Sancho referred to himself as king not only of Aragon but also Navarre.

Sancho conquered Barbastro in 1064, Graus in 1083, and Monzón in 1089. He was defeated by El Cid, who was raiding his lands and those of his Muslim allies, at the Battle of Morella, probably in 1084. He perished in 1094 at the battle of Huesca.

Sancho contracted his first marriage in , to Isabella (died ), daughter of Count Armengol III of Urgel. They were divorced 1071. His second marriage, in 1076, was with Felicia (died 3 May 1123), daughter of Hilduin IV, Count of Montdidier. A third marriage—to Philippa of Toulouse—is sometimes given, but contemporary evidence records him as still married to Felicia at the time of his death. He was father of four sons: by Isabella, he had Peter, his successor; by Felicia he had Ferdinand, who was alive in 1086 but died within the next decade, Alfonso, who succeeded Peter, and Ramiro, who succeeded Alfonso.

==Marriage and family==

Sancho Ramírez married Isabella of Urgell, daughter of Ermengol III, Count of Urgell around the year 1062. They had one known child:

* Peter (c. 1068 – 1104), known as &quot;the Catholic&quot;, who ruled as King of Aragon and Pamplona from 1094 until 1104. Peter married Agnes of Aquitaine.

Sancho Ramírez remarried around 1071 with Felicia of Roucy, daughter of Hilduin IV, Count of Montdidier. They had three children:

* Fernando Sánchez (1071 – 1094)
* Alfonso Sánchez ( 1073 – 1134), known as &quot;the Battler&quot;, King of Aragon and Pamplona from 1104 until 1134. He married Urraca of León, Queen of León, Castile and Galicia. Their marriage was annulled in 1112.
* Ramiro Sánchez (1086 – 1157), known as &quot;the Monk&quot;, King of Aragon between 1134 and 1157, and married to Agnes of Aquitaine in her second marriage after Viscount of Thouars, Aimery V.

<text>Peter I (, , ; 1068 – 1104) was King of Aragon and also Pamplona from 1094 until his death in 1104. Peter was the eldest son of Sancho Ramírez, from whom he inherited the crowns of Aragon and Pamplona, and Isabella of Urgell. He was named in honour of Saint Peter, because of his father&#x27;s special devotion to the Holy See, to which he had made his kingdom a vassal. Peter continued his father&#x27;s close alliance with the Church and pursued his military thrust south against bordering Al-Andalus taifas with great success, allying with Rodrigo Díaz de Vivar, known as &quot;El Cid&quot;, the ruler of Valencia, against the Almoravids. According to the medieval &quot;Annales Compostellani&quot; Peter was &quot;expert in war and daring in initiative&quot;, and one modern historian has remarked that &quot;his grasp of the possibilities inherent in the age seems to have been faultless.&quot;

==Early life==

The &quot;Crónica de San Juan de la Peña&quot;, a rather late source for Peter&#x27;s reign, states that Peter was 35 years of age when he died, which places his birth in 1068 or 1069. As a child Peter was placed in the line of succession to the County of Urgell by the first testament of his uncle Ermengol IV, after Ermengol&#x27;s own son and brothers. He was not destined to inherit it.

In 1085, two years after his father had conquered Graus (28 April 1083), Peter was entrusted with Sobrarbe and Ribagorza as a subkingdom with its capital at Graus, which he thenceforth ruled more or less independently with the title of king (Latin &quot;rex&quot;). On 28 October 1087 Peter joined his father in Pamplona in Navarre, where the two monarchs confirmed the rights of the bishops in the city. He pursued the &quot;Reconquista&quot; with vigour in the southeast of the realm. In 1087 he may have been present at the unsuccessful siege of Tudela. Later that year he conquered Estada, in 1088 Montearagón, and on 24 June 1089 Monzón. These conquests opened up the valley of the Cinca, which he proceeded to conquer as far as Almenar, taken in 1093.

== Sole reign ==
Peter succeeded to the whole of his father&#x27;s kingdom on the latter&#x27;s death while besieging Huesca in 1094. Peter raised the siege, only to return to it within the year. After 1094 his objectives shifted westwards, towards the valley of the Gallega. In 1095 Peter renewed his father&#x27;s oaths to Urban II, and Urban renewed his promise of protection, under which Sancho, his sons, and his kingdom had been placed in July 1089. On 16 March 1095 the pope even issued a bull, &quot;Cum universis sancte&quot;, granting the king and queen of Aragon immunity from excommunication without the permission of the pope. That same year, while he was besieging Huesca, Peter defeated the relief forces of the Taifa of Zaragoza at the Battle of Alcoraz. Peter later rewarded a certain Sancho Crispo for his contribution of three hundred knights and infantry at Alcoraz. He went on to take Huesca on 27 November of that same year.

===&quot;Reconquista&quot; and war with the Almoravids===
The next year (1096) Peter travelled south to inspect his fortress at Castellón, though the &quot;Historia Roderici&quot; claims that he came to help Rodrigo. He met Rodrigo in Valencia and with a large force already assembled they decided to reinforce the southern frontier fort of Benicadell, rebuilt by Rodrigo in 1091. As they were passing by Xàtiva they were met by an Almoravid force under the command of Mohammed, the nephew of Almoravid leader Yusuf ibn Tashfin, and the commander whom Rodrigo had defeated at the Battle of Cuarte in 1095. They decided to hastily restock Benicadell and retreat to Valencia via the coast, but were met at the Battle of Bairén by Muhammad&#x27;s forces encamped on the high ground that reached almost to the sea. A small Almoravid fleet had been assembled from the southern ports, including Almería, and the Christians were trapped between arrow fire from the ships and the cavalry perched atop the hill. Rodrigo roused the troops with a speech and the next day at midday the Christians charged. The Battle of Xàtiva ended in a rout, with many Almoravids killed or forced into the river or the sea, where many drowned. Peter and Rodrigo returned to Valencia in triumph and thanking God for the victory, as the &quot;Historia&quot; records.

In 1099, in preparation for the fall of Barbastro, Peter sent Ponce, then Bishop of Roda, to Rome to ask Pope Urban II to transfer the see of Roda to Barbastro. The pope complied with Peter&#x27;s request, and endowed the transferred diocese with all the re-conquered lands of the Diocese of Lleida. Peter&#x27;s motive in this action was probably to curtail any expansion of the Diocese of Urgell in the direction of Lleida. In any case, Barbastro fell in 1100.

According to what is probably a legend, at the urging of the monks of San Juan de la Peña Peter planned to join on the Crusade of 1101 and make a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, but Pope Paschal II refused to allow it and ordered him to make war on Zaragoza instead. Peter, probably aided by knights from France and Catalonia, certainly did make war on Zaragoza in 1101, in a campaign that lasted the whole year. He may have been inspired by the First Crusaders, since contemporary accounts of the 1101 campaign call him a &quot;cross-bearer&quot; (&quot;crucifer&quot;). The size of his forces so impressed a contemporary scribe in León that he remarked in the dating formula of a document of 12 February that &quot;Peter, Aragonese king, with his infinite multitude of armed men, the city of Zaragoza, with Christ&#x27;s banner, fought&quot;. By June Peter had begun the siege of Zaragoza itself. For the siege he had a fortress built named Juslibol (a corruption of the Latin slogan &quot;Deus lo volt&quot; [God wills it] used by the First Crusaders) and ringed the city with banners bearing the cross. In August he was conducting a &quot;razzia&quot; (raid) as far south as Alpenes and the river Ebro, but the campaign was eventually aborted due to insufficient cavalry. By the end of the year he had expanded Aragon and Navarre in the west almost as far as the walls of Zaragoza and Tudela, though the cities both remained in Muslim hands.

===Administration of the realm and the granting of &quot;fueros&quot;===

During his reign Peter bestowed &quot;fueros&quot; on Barbastro (1100), Caparroso (1102), and Santacara (1102). The last was repopulated partly by Frenchmen, whose influence on local customs is apparent. According to Peter&#x27;s &quot;fueros&quot;, citizens were required to serve in local campaigns and castle defence, but were exempted from long-term service in the &quot;host&quot;. Horse-owners resident in the towns of Barbastro and Santa Cristina de Somport (1104) were also exempted from knight-service, known as &quot;cavalcata&quot;. In 1101 Peter delineated the boundaries of the diocese of Barbastro–Roda, and those that would belong to Lleida after its reconquest. On 11 December 1102 Peter was in Estella on the border with Castile, perhaps seeking the aid of Alfonso VI after a particularly disastrous autumn for the Christians of eastern Spain. In 1104 Peter granted a &quot;fuero&quot; to all the &quot;infanzones&quot; of his realm, retaining his right to require three-day field service.

==Succession==
Peter&#x27;s first marriage, to Agnes of Aquitaine (betrothed 1081), was arranged by his father and took place in the capital of Jaca in January 1086. His second marriage, to a certain Bertha, probably from Lombardy, was officiated in Huesca on 16 August 1097. This represented the transferral of the capital of Aragon from Jaca to the larger city of Huesca. Peter&#x27;s only children, Isabella and Peter (born 1086), both from his first marriage, died young in 1103 and on 1 February 1104, respectively. Peter was married to María Rodríguez, a daughter of El Cid, in 1098 - a marriage celebrated in the &quot;Cantar de mio Cid&quot; and in subsequent literature. Both Isabella and Peter were interred in San Juan de la Peña on 18 August 1104.

When Peter I died in the Val d&#x27;Aran his kingdoms passed to his younger half-brother, Alfonso the Battler. Peter was buried in San Juan de la Peña alongside his children. When Alfonso also died without living children, the kingdom of Aragon passed to the youngest brother, Ramiro II. Peter&#x27;s name was adopted, in a feminised form, for Ramiro&#x27;s only child, and successor, Petronilla (1137–64). The name &quot;Peter&quot; entered the name-pool of the House of Barcelona into which Petronilla married and appeared commonly thereafter in the ruling family of Aragon.

<text>Dore Abbey is a former Cistercian abbey in the village of Abbey Dore in the Golden Valley, Herefordshire, England. A large part of the original medieval building has been used since the 16th century as the parish church, with remaining parts either now ruined or no longer extant.

==History==
The abbey was founded in 1147 by Robert fitzHarold of Ewyas, the Lord of Ewyas Harold, possibly on the site of earlier wooden monastic buildings of which no traces remain. The abbey is located close to the River Dore. It was formed as a daughter house of the Cistercian abbey at Morimond in France, perhaps after Lord Robert had met the Abbot of Morimond on the Second Crusade. Construction of buildings in local sandstone began around 1175, and continued through the time of the first three abbots, Adam (1186-c.1216), Adam II (c.1216–1236), and Stephen of Worcester (1236–1257). The design of the church was modelled on that of Morimond, with a presbytery, two chapels, two transepts, a crossing and a nave.

Gerald of Wales claimed that the first Abbot Adam was a devious individual intent on acquiring property by any means, fair or foul. During the early 13th century, the abbey expanded its land holdings, particularly through the acquisition of good quality farmland in the area granted to them by King John in 1216. This enabled the abbey to become wealthy, especially through the sale of wool, and as a result the abbey was largely rebuilt in the Early English style. The presbytery was expanded, and additional chapels, a processional ambulatory, and domestic buildings including a chapter house were added. In 1260, the abbey was described as a &quot;sumptuous church&quot;. The new building was consecrated by Thomas de Cantilupe, Bishop of Hereford, in 1282, and was dedicated to the Holy Trinity and Saint Mary. Around 1305, Richard Straddell (d.1346) became Abbot. He was a distinguished scholar and theologian who at times served as a diplomat for the crown. In 1321 he was given a relic of the Holy Cross by William de Gradisson, and the abbey became a centre of pilgrimage.

Large parts of the 12th- and 13th-century buildings, including the north and south transepts and the interior columns, together with some tiles, wooden fittings and fragments of stained glass, remain in place today, incorporated into the later church. The building also houses two 13th-century effigies, thought to be those of a later Lord Robert of Ewyas and his half-brother Roger de Clifford (d.1286), and carved stone roof bosses.

The abbey was run with the aid of seventeen granges, nine in the Golden Valley, four in northern Gwent, and three far to the west in Brycheiniog, centred on the parish of Gwenddwr; these last were at the extreme limit of the distance granges were supposed to be, a day&#x27;s journey from the abbey. The abbey also owned property in Hereford and elsewhere, and drew revenues from five appropriated parishes.

The abbey was dissolved in 1536. The building was bought by a local landowner, John Scudamore, a member of a gentry family historically connected with Owain Glyndŵr. Some items were hidden but most of the building was allowed to fall into disrepair. The surviving building was restored in the 1630s by his great-great-grandson John Scudamore, 1st Viscount Scudamore, 
who, after the early deaths of several of his children, became convinced that he should make amends for living off the proceeds of former monastic land. Scudamore was a friend of William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, who is believed to have influenced the re-design and rebuilding of the church, for its use as a parish church. The original mediaeval altar was found in a nearby farm, being used for salting meat and making cheese, and was returned to the church. The original nave was blocked off and a new tower erected, and a new carved oak rood screen, incorporating the arms of Scudamore, Laud, and King Charles I, was made by John Abel of Hereford. In addition, new stained glass was provided, and the walls were painted with instructional pictures and texts, many of which remain visible. The new church was re-consecrated on 22 March 1634. Further restoration was carried out between 1700 and 1710, and new paintings, including a large coat of arms of Queen Anne, were added.

By the end of the nineteenth century the church was again in need of repair, and work was carried out by a local architect, Roland Paul, in 1901–09. Paul was also responsible for part-excavating and plotting the remaining foundations and traces of the original Abbey buildings, which now underlie the churchyard.

==Churchyard==
The churchyard contains the grave of Driver William John Watkins, a Royal Field Artillery soldier of World War I.

<text>Boxgrove Priory is a ruined priory in the village of Boxgrove in Sussex, England. It was founded in the 12th century.

==History==
===Origins===
The Priory was founded in the reign of Henry I, about 1123 by Robert de Haia (or de la Haye), Lord of Halnacre by gift of the king. A Saxon church had existed on the site before the Conquest. The Priory was founded for three Benedictine monks, and was a dependency by the Lessay Abbey in Normandy.

In about 1126, upon the marriage of Robert&#x27;s daughter Cecily to Roger St John the number of monks living at Boxgrove was increased from the original three to six. Robert had died by 1165. By 1187 there were 15 monks. A 19th monk was added to the priory in about 1230 by William de Kainesham, Canon of Chichester.

By 1535 the priory&#x27;s possessions were worth £185 19s. 8d. gross, and £145 10s. 2½d. clear.

===Dissolution===
The Priory was dissolved in 1536. At the time of the dissolution there were eight priests and one novice, as well as twenty-eight servants and eight children living in the priory. After the dissolution, the Priory church became the parish church.

==Modern history==
The Priory church is still in use as the Church of St Mary and St Blaise. 

The ruins are a Grade I listed building.

<doc id="106500" wikidata="Q316194" url="?curid=106500" title="Ramiro II of Aragon">
<text>Ramiro II (24 April 1086 – 16 August 1157), called the Monk, was a member of the House of Jiménez who became king of Aragon in 1134. Although a monk, he was elected by the Aragonese nobility to succeed his childless brother Alfonso the Battler. He then had a daughter, Petronilla, whom he had marry Count Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona, unifying Aragon and Barcelona into the Crown of Aragon. He withdrew to a monastery in 1137, leaving authority to Ramon Berenguer but keeping the royal title until his death.

==Early life==
Ramiro was the youngest son of Sancho Ramírez, king of Aragon and Navarre, and Felicia of Roucy. Sancho placed Ramiro as a child into the Benedictine monastery of Saint Pons de Thomières in the Viscounty of Béziers. As a respected monk, Ramiro was elected abbot of the Castillian royal monastery of Santos Fecundo y Primitivo in Sahagún and later was abbot of the monastery of San Pedro el Viejo at Huesca. Wanting to limit Ramiro&#x27;s power within the Kingdom of Navarre-Aragon, his brother Alfonso the Battler had blocked his elections as bishop of Burgos and as bishop of Pamplona.

In 1134 Ramiro had been elected bishop of Barbastro-Roda when the death of his childless brother made him one of the candidates for succession to the crown. Others put forward included Alfonso VII of Castile, who as a foreign king found little support, and the choice of the Navarrese nobility, Pedro de Atarés, grandson of Sancho Ramírez, Count of Ribagorza, the illegitimate son of Ramiro I of Aragon. At an assembly at Borja intended to resolve the succession, a misunderstanding alienated Pedro from his supporters, yet they were unwilling to accept the Aragonese-favored Ramiro, and in the end the kingdoms were divided. In Navarre, García Ramírez, a scion of the pre-union royal family of Navarre and protégé of Alfonso VII was chosen king, while in Aragon the choice fell on Ramiro, who suspended his monastic vows to take the crown.

==King of Aragon==

The reign of Ramiro the Monk, as he is known, was tumultuous. At the beginning of his reign he had problems with his nobles, who thought he would be docile and easily steered to their wishes, but discovered him to be inflexible. In order to produce an heir, Ramiro married Agnes, daughter of Duke William IX of Aquitaine. He and Agnes had a daughter, Petronilla, who was betrothed to Count Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona at the age of one. The marriage contract, signed at Barbastro on 11 August 1137, made Petronilla the heir to the crown of Aragon, which in event of her childless death would pass to Ramon Berenguer and any children he might have by other wives. Ramon accepted Ramiro as &quot;King, Lord and Father&quot;, and the County of Barcelona and the Kingdom of Aragon were united into the Crown of Aragon. The previously-landlocked Aragonese state thus returned to the position of peninsular power it had held prior to the loss of Navarre, and received a window to the Western Mediterranean it would come to dominate.

In the time between his accession and the betrothal of his daughter, Ramiro II had already had to put down a rebellion of the nobles, and knowing himself not to be a war king, he passed royal authority to his son-in-law Ramon Berenguer on 13 November 1137. Ramon became the &quot;Prince of the Aragonese people&quot; (&quot;Princeps Aragonensis&quot;) and effective chief of the kingdom&#x27;s armies. Ramiro withdrew from public life, returning to the Abbey of San Pedro in Huesca. He later became known for the famous and passionate legend of the Bell of Huesca. He died there on 16 August 1157 and is buried there.

In 1137 he ceded the throne but continued to hold the title of king until his death, and even so the chronicles written in other kingdoms mention him. Regardless of Ramiro&#x27;s title, his daughter Petronilla was using the title of &quot;regina&quot; (queen) in not only the document about her abdication in 1164 but also her will, written in 1152, before her father&#x27;s death.

<text>Werner Hans Erhard (born John Paul Rosenberg; September 5, 1935) is an American lecturer known for founding est (offered from 1971 to 1984). In 1985, he replaced the est Training with a newly designed program, the Forum. Since 1991, the Forum has been kept up to date and offered by Landmark Education. Erhard has written, lectured, and taught on self-improvement.

In 1977, Erhard co-founded The Hunger Project, an NGO. In 1991, he retired from business and sold his existing intellectual property to his employees, who then adopted the name Landmark Education, renamed Landmark Worldwide in 2013.

==Personal life==
John Paul Rosenberg was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on September 5, 1935. His father was a small-restaurant owner who left Judaism for a Baptist mission and then joined his wife in the Episcopalian denomination where she taught Sunday School. They agreed that their son should choose his religion when he was old enough. He chose to be baptized in the Episcopal Church, served there for eight years as an acolyte, and has been an Episcopalian since.

Rosenberg attended Norristown High School in Norristown, Pennsylvania, where he received the English award in his senior year. He graduated in June 1953, along with his future wife Patricia Fry, whom he married on September 26, 1953; they had four children.

In 1960, Rosenberg deserted his wife and their children in Philadelphia. Rosenberg and June Bryde assumed false identities and traveled to Indianapolis. He chose the name &quot;Werner Hans Erhard&quot; from &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine articles he had read about West German economics minister Ludwig Erhard and physicist Werner Heisenberg. Bryde changed her name to Ellen Virginia Erhard. The Erhards moved to St. Louis, where Werner took a job as a car salesman.

Patricia Rosenberg and their four children initially relied on welfare and help from family and friends. After five years without contact, Patricia Rosenberg divorced Erhard for desertion and remarried.

In October 1972, a year after creating Erhard Seminars Training, Erhard contacted his first wife and family, arranged to provide support and college education for the children, and repaid Patricia&#x27;s parents for their financial support. Between 1973 and 1975, members of his extended family took the est training, and Patricia and his younger siblings took jobs in the est organization.

==Career==

===&quot;Parents&quot; Magazine Cultural Institute===
From the early mid-1950s until 1960, Rosenberg worked in various automobile dealerships, with a stint managing a medium-duty industrial equipment firm. In 1961, Erhard began selling correspondence courses in the Midwest. He then moved to Spokane, Washington, where he worked at Encyclopædia Britannica&#x27;s &quot;Great Books&quot; program as an area training manager. In January 1962, he began working at &quot;Parents&quot; Magazine Cultural Institute, a division of W. R. Grace &amp; Co. In the summer of 1962, he became territorial manager for California, Nevada, and Arizona, and moved to San Francisco, and in the spring of 1963 moved to Los Angeles. In January 1964, &quot;Parents&quot; transferred him to Arlington, Virginia as the southeast division manager; but after a dispute with the company&#x27;s president, he returned to his previous position as west coast division manager in San Francisco. Over the next few years, Erhard brought on as &quot;Parents&quot; staff many people who later became important in est, including Elaine Cronin, Gonneke Spits, and Laurel Scheaf.

===Influences===
Erhard acknowledges a wide range of influences in his development including a variety of experiences. He did not have much formal education but was instead self educated. He became interested in physics in high school and later developed friendships with Nobel Laureates Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann, from whom he gained knowledge of theoretical physics. Erhard also credits being tutored by philosophers, Michel Foucault, Humberto Maturana, Sir Karl Popper, and Hilary Putnam.

During his time in St. Louis in the 1960&#x27;s, Erhard read two books that had a marked effect on him: Napoleon Hill&#x27;s &quot;Think and Grow Rich&quot; (1937) and Maxwell Maltz&#x27;s &quot;Psycho-Cybernetics&quot; (1960). When a member of his staff at &quot;Parents Magazine&quot; introduced him to the ideas of Abraham Maslow and Carl Rogers, both key figures in the Human Potential Movement, he became more interested in personal fulfillment than sales success.

After moving to Sausalito, he attended seminars by Alan Watts, a Western interpreter of Zen Buddhism, who introduced him to the distinction between mind and self; Erhard subsequently became close friends with Watts. Erhard also studied in Japan with Zen rōshi Yamada Mumon. In Bartley&#x27;s biography, &quot;Werner Erhard: The Transformation of a Man, the Founding of est&quot; (1978), Bartley quotes Erhard as acknowledging Zen as an essential contribution that &quot;created the space for&quot; est.

Erhard attended the Dale Carnegie Course in 1967. He was sufficiently impressed by it to make his staff attend the course, and began to think about developing a course of his own. Over the following years, he investigated a wide range of movements, including Encounter, Transactional Analysis, Enlightenment Intensive, Subud and Scientology.

In 1970, Erhard became involved in Mind Dynamics and began teaching his own version of Mind Dynamics classes in San Francisco and Los Angeles. The directors of Mind Dynamics eventually invited him into their partnership, but Erhard rejected the offer, saying he would rather develop his own seminar program—est, the first program of which he conducted in October 1971. John Hanley, who later founded Lifespring, was also involved at this time. In their 1992 book &quot;Perspectives on the New Age&quot;, James R. Lewis and J. Gordon Melton write that Mind Dynamics, est, and LifeSpring have &quot;striking&quot; similarities, as all used &quot;authoritarian trainers who enforce numerous rules,&quot; require applause from participants, and deemphasize reason in favor of emotion. The authors also describe graduates recruiting heavily on behalf of the companies, thereby eliminating marketing expenses.

In the early 1980’s shortly before the est training was phased out, Erhard was introduced to the work of philosopher Martin Heidegger. He consulted with Heideggerian scholars (Hubert Dreyfus and Michael E. Zimmerman) who noted consistencies with the est training and elements of Heidegger’s thought.

===est (1971–1984)===

Starting in 1971, est, short for Erhard Seminars Training and Latin for &quot;it is&quot;, offered in-depth personal and professional development workshops, the initial program of which was called &quot;The est Training&quot;. The est Training&#x27;s purpose was to transform the way one sees and makes sense of life so that the situations one had been trying to change or tolerating clear up in the process of living itself. The point was to leave participants free to be, while increasing their effectiveness and the quality of their lives. The est Training was experiential and transformational in nature.

The workshops were offered until 1984, when the est training was replaced by the Forum. As of 1984, 700,000 people had completed the est training. American ethicist, philosopher, and historian Jonathan D. Moreno has described the est training as &quot;the most important cultural event after the human potential movement itself seemed exhausted&quot; and a form of &quot;Socratic interrogation&quot;. Erhard challenged participants to be themselves and live in the present instead of playing a role imposed on them by their past, and to move beyond their current points of view into a perspective from which they could observe their own positionality. The author Robert Hargrove said &quot;you&#x27;re going to notice that things do begin to clear up, just in the process of life itself&quot;.

The first est course was held in San Francisco, California, in October 1971. By the mid-1970s Erhard had trained 10 others to lead est courses. Between 1972 and 1974 est centers opened in Los Angeles, Aspen, Honolulu, and New York City.

===Werner Erhard Foundation (1973–1991)===
In the early 1970s, the est Foundation became the Werner Erhard Foundation, with the aim of &quot;providing financial and organizational support to individuals and groups engaged in charitable and educational pursuits—research, communication, education, and scholarly endeavors in the fields of individual and social transformation and human well-being.&quot; The Foundation supported projects launched by people committed to altering what is possible for humanity, such as The Hunger Project, The Mastery Foundation, The Holiday Project, and the Youth at Risk Program, programs that continue to be active. It also organized presentations by scholars and humanitarians such as the Dalai Lama and Buckminster Fuller and hosted an annual conference in theoretical physics, a science in which Erhard was especially interested. The annual conference was designed to give physicists an opportunity to work with their colleagues on what they were developing before they published, and was attended by such physicists as Richard Feynman, Stephen Hawking, and Leonard Susskind.

===The Hunger Project===

In 1977, with the support of John Denver, former Oberlin College president Robert W. Fuller, and others, Erhard founded The Hunger Project, a nonprofit NGO. In 1991 the organization severed its ties to Werner Erhard, Erhard Seminars Training, and its philosophies. The origin of the Hunger Project can be seen in the 1977 source document &quot;The End of Starvation: Creating an Idea Whose Time Has Come&quot;, written by Erhard.

===Werner Erhard and Associates (1981–1991) and &quot;The Forum&quot;===

In the 1980s, Erhard created a new program called the Forum, which began in January 1985. Also during that period he developed and presented a series of seminars, broadcast via satellite, that included interviews with contemporary thinkers in science, economics, sports, and the arts on topics such as creativity, performance, and money.

In October 1987, Erhard hosted a televised broadcast with sports coaches John Wooden, Red Auerbach, Tim Gallwey and George Allen to discuss principles of coaching across all disciplines. They sought to identify distinctions found in coaching regardless of the subject being coached. Jim Selman moderated the discussion and, in 1989, documented the outcome in the article &quot;Coaching and the Art of Management.&quot;

=== Subsequent work ===
During the 1990s, Erhard lectured and led programs in various locations, including Russia, Japan, and Ireland. He had a three-year contract to give courses to Soviet managers that would allow Soviet officials to study his teaching methods. He consulted for both businesses and government agencies in Russia. In the early 1990s he conducted seminars in Japan for professionals coping with their financial crisis. In 1999, Erhard and Peter Block worked with a nonprofit organization for clergy and grassroots leaders to come up with new ways to deal with the peace process in Ireland.

Erhard and Michael C. Jensen, Professor of Business Administration emeritus, led seminars and training sessions at Harvard. They also explored the relationship between integrity and performance in a paper published at Harvard Business School.

Erhard and Jensen developed and led a course on leadership that took an experience-based, rather than knowledge-based, approach to leadership. Students were asked to master integrity and authenticity, among other principles, so that they could leave the class as leaders rather than merely learning about leadership. The course has been taught at several universities worldwide as well as at the United States Air Force Academy.

=== Landmark Education ===

In 1991, the group that later formed Landmark Education purchased Erhard&#x27;s intellectual property. In 1998, &quot;Time&quot; magazine published an article about Landmark Education and its historical connection to Erhard. The article stated: &quot;In 1991, before he left the U.S., Erhard sold the &#x27;technology&#x27; behind his seminars to his employees, who formed a new company called the Landmark Education Corp., with Erhard&#x27;s brother Harry Rosenberg at the helm.&quot; According to Landmark Education, its programs have as their basis ideas originally developed by Erhard, but Erhard has no financial interest, ownership, or management role in Landmark Education. In &quot;Stephanie Ney v. Landmark Education Corporation&quot; (1994), a court ruled that Landmark Education Corporation did not have successor-liability to Werner Erhard &amp; Associates, the corporation whose assets it purchased.

According to Steven Pressman&#x27;s 1993 book &quot;Outrageous Betrayal&quot;, Landmark Education agreed to pay Erhard a long-term licensing fee for the material used in the Forum and other courses: &quot;Erhard stood to earn up to $15 million over the next 18 years.&quot; But Arthur Schreiber&#x27;s declaration of May 3, 2005 states: &quot;Landmark Education has never paid Erhard under the license agreements (he assigned his rights to others).&quot;

In 2001, &quot;New York Magazine&quot; reported that Landmark Education CEO Harry Rosenberg said that the company had bought Erhard&#x27;s license outright and his rights to the business in Japan and Mexico. From time to time, Erhard acts as a consultant to Landmark Education.

== Critics and disputes ==
Erhard became the object of popular fascination and criticism, with the media tending to vilify him over several decades. Moreno has written, &quot;Allegations of all sorts of personal and financial wrongdoing were hurled at him, none of which were borne out and some [of which] were even publicly retracted by major media organizations.&quot; Various skeptics have questioned or criticized the validity of Erhard&#x27;s work and his motivations. Psychiatrist Marc Galanter called Erhard &quot;a man with no formal experience in mental health, self-help, or religious revivalism, but a background in retail sales&quot;. Michael E. Zimmerman, chair of the philosophy department at Tulane University, wrote &quot;A Philosophical Assessment of the est Training&quot;, in which he calls Erhard &quot;a kind of artist, a thinker, an inventor, who has big debts to others, borrowed from others, but then put the whole thing together in a way that no one else had ever done.&quot; Sacramento City College philosophy professor Robert Todd Carroll has called est a &quot;hodge-podge of philosophical bits and pieces culled from the carcasses of existential philosophy, [and] motivational psychology.&quot; Social critic John Bassett MacCleary called Erhard &quot;a former used-car salesman&quot; and est &quot;just another moneymaking scam.&quot; NYU psychology professor Paul Vitz called est &quot;primarily a business&quot; and said its &quot;style of operation has been labeled as fascist.&quot;

In 1991, Erhard &quot;vanished amid reports of tax fraud (which proved false and won him $200,000 from the IRS) and allegations of incest (which were later recanted).&quot; The March 3, 1991, episode of &quot;60 Minutes&quot; covered these allegations and was later removed by CBS due to factual inaccuracies. On March 3, 1992, Erhard sued CBS, &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; reporter John Hubner and approximately 20 other defendants for libel, defamation, slander, invasion of privacy, and conspiracy. On May 20, 1992, he filed for dismissal of his own case and sent each of the defendants $100 to cover their filing fees in the case. Erhard told Larry King in an interview that he dropped the suit after receiving legal advice telling him that in order to win it, he would have to prove not just that CBS knew the allegations were false but that CBS acted with malice. Erhard told King that his family members had since retracted their allegations, which according to Erhard had been made under pressure from the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; producer.

Erhard&#x27;s daughters retracted the allegations of sexual abuse they had made against him. Celeste Erhard, one of the daughters featured on &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, sued Hubner and the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; for $2 million, accusing the newspaper of having &quot;defrauded her and invaded her privacy&quot;, saying she had exaggerated information, been promised a $2 million book deal, and appeared on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; to get publicity for the book. Celeste claimed that her quotes in the &quot;Mercury News&quot; article were deceitfully obtained. The case was dismissed in August 1993, the judge ruling that the statute of limitations had expired, that Celeste &quot;had suffered no monetary damages or physical harm and that she failed to present legal evidence that Hubner had deliberately misled her&quot;, which is legally required for damages.

CBS subsequently withdrew the video of the &quot;60 Minutes&quot; program from the market. A disclaimer said, &quot;this segment has been deleted at the request of CBS News for legal or copyright reasons&quot;.

In 1992, a court entered a default judgment of $380,000 against Erhard in absentia in a case alleging negligent injury. The appellate court stated that he had not been personally served and was not present at the trial.

In 1993, Erhard filed a wrongful disclosure lawsuit against the IRS, asserting that IRS agents had incorrectly and illegally revealed details of his tax returns to the media. In April 1991, IRS spokesmen were widely quoted alleging that &quot;Erhard owed millions of dollars in back taxes, that he was transferring assets out of the country, and that the agency was suing Erhard&quot;, branding Erhard a &quot;tax cheat&quot;. On April 15, the IRS was reported to have placed a lien of $6.7 million on Erhard&#x27;s personal property. In his suit, Erhard stated that he had never refused to pay taxes that were lawfully due, and in September 1996 he won the suit. The IRS paid him $200,000 in damages. While admitting that the media reports quoting the IRS on Erhard&#x27;s tax liabilities had been false, the IRS took no action to have the media correct those statements.

A private investigator quoted in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated that, by October 1989, Scientology had collected five filing cabinets&#x27; worth of materials about Erhard, many from certain graduates of est who had joined Scientology, and that Scientology was clearly in the process of organizing a &quot;media blitz&quot; aimed at discrediting him. According to Erhard&#x27;s brother Harry Rosenberg, &quot;Werner made some very, very powerful enemies. They really got him.&quot;

<doc id="106502" wikidata="Q378038" url="?curid=106502" title="Estuary English">
<text>Estuary English is an English accent, continuum of accents, or continuum of accent features associated with the area along the River Thames and its estuary, including London, since the late 20th century. Phonetician John C. Wells proposed a definition of Estuary English as &quot;Standard English spoken with the accent of the southeast of England&quot;. He views Estuary English as an emerging standard accent of England, while also acknowledging that it is a social construct rather than a technically well-defined linguistic phenomenon. He describes it as &quot;intermediate&quot; between the 20th-century higher-class non-regional standard accent, Received Pronunciation (RP), and the 20th-century lower-class local London accent, Cockney. There is much debate among linguists as to where Cockney and RP end and where Estuary English begins, or whether Estuary English is even a single cohesive accent.

==Name==
Cruttenden uses the term London Regional General British in preference to the popular term &quot;Estuary English&quot;.

The names listed above may be abbreviated:
* Estuary English → EE
* London Regional General British → London RGB

Wells has used different names for an accent closer to Cockney (Popular London) or closer to Received Pronunciation (London Regional Standard or South-Eastern Regional Standard). Cruttenden uses the name Popular London to refer to Cockney pronunciation itself.

==Status as accent of English==
The boundaries between RP (Received Pronunciation), Estuary English and Cockney are far from clear-cut. Wells cites David Rosewarne (who originated the term) as locating EE in the middle of &quot;a continuum that has RP and London speech at either end&quot;. Several writers have argued that Estuary English is not a discrete accent distinct from the accents of the London area. The sociolinguist Peter Trudgill has written that the term &quot;Estuary English&quot; is inappropriate because &quot;it suggests that we are talking about a new variety, which we are not; and because it suggests that it is a variety of English confined to the banks of the Thames estuary, which it is not. The label actually refers to the lower middle-class accents, as opposed to working-class accents, of the Home Counties Modern Dialect area&quot;. Roach comments, &quot;In reality there is no such accent and the term should be used with care. The idea originates from the sociolinguistic observation that some people in public life who would previously have been expected to speak with an RP accent now find it acceptable to speak with some characteristics of the London area... such as glottal stops, which would in earlier times have caused comment or disapproval&quot;.

 state &quot;All of its [EE&#x27;s] features can be located on a sociolinguistic and geographical continuum between RP and Cockney, and are spreading not because Estuary English is a coherent and identifiable influence, but because the features represent neither the standard nor the extreme non-standard poles of the continuum&quot;. In order to tackle these problems put forward by expert linguists, argues that Estuary English should be viewed as a folk category rather than an expert linguistic category. As such it takes the form of a perceptual prototype category that does not require discrete boundaries in order to function in the eyes (and ears) of lay observers of language variation and change.

Collins et al. state that &quot;In the 1990s and the first few years of the 2000s, this putative new variety was fiercely debated both in the media and academia, but since then interest in Estuary English has waned and been replaced by discussion of the capital&#x27;s latest linguistic innovation – Multicultural London English&quot;.

==Features==
Published accounts of EE describe it mainly in terms of differences from contemporary RP and from Cockney. Wells (1994) states that &quot;Estuary English (EE) is like RP, but unlike Cockney, in being associated with standard grammar and usage&quot;. Differences are found at phonemic and allophonic levels. 

===Features distinguishing EE from RP===
Wells identifies a small number of key features that may distinguish EE from RP; these features may be summarized as follows:

* /l/-vocalization
* /t/-glottalization
* Diphthong shift
* Yod-coalescence

Other distinguishing features have been suggested by other studies:

* &quot;Th&quot;-fronting
* Other vowel differences

====/l/-vocalization====
It has been widely observed that EE exhibits vocalization of preconsonantal/final /l/, perhaps with various vowel mergers before it (an informal example being &quot;miwk bottoo&quot; for &quot;milk bottle&quot;). Wells cites the specific case of allophony in GOAT (&gt; [ɒʊ] before dark /l/ or its reflex), leading perhaps to a phonemic split (&quot;wholly&quot; vs. &quot;holy&quot;). This topic is usually referred to as L-vocalization. There is said to be alternation between the vocalized , dark non-vocalized and clear non-vocalized , depending on the word. These alternations happen in final positions or in a final consonant cluster, e.g. &quot;sold&quot; (pronounced ). In London, that may even occur before a vowel: &quot;girl out&quot; . In all phonetic environments, male London speakers were at least twice as likely to vocalize the dark l as female London speakers. According to , the vocalized dark l is sometimes an unoccluded lateral approximant, which differs from the RP only by the lack of the alveolar contact.

/l/-vocalization can lead to loss of distinctions between some vowels and diphthongs. Examples of vowel mergers before historic found in EE are:

* (as in ) merges with (as in ). 
* (as in ) merges with (as in ).
* (as in ) merges with (as in ).
* Other possible mergers include the following:
** (as in ) can merge with (as in ). Since merges with , it also participates in this merger.
** (as in ) can merge with both (as in ) and (as in ).
** (as in ) can merge with both (as in ) and (as in ).
** (as in ) can merge with (as in ).
** (as in ) can merge with (as in ).
** (as in ) can merge with (as in ).

 found coda pronounced as clear , as in most accents of Irish English, in some speakers: she notes that in her study, &quot;all four Essex speakers have a clear in &quot;pull&quot;.&quot;

/l/-vocalization appears to be spreading into RP (or GB, the similar accent referred to by some writers). Collins et al say &quot;Traditional RP speakers tend to stigmatize this feature, which is nevertheless one of the most striking changes going on in present-day GB English&quot;.

====/t/-glottalization====
The term glottalization has several different meanings: the most important are glottal reinforcement (or &quot;pre-glottalization&quot;), where a glottal closure accompanies an oral closure, and glottal replacement, where a glottal closure is substituted for an oral consonant.

Although glottalization of /t/ has been singled out for attention in discussion of EE features, pre-glottalization of /p/, /k/ and /tʃ/ is also widespread in RP, particularly when another consonant follows. Examples are &quot;popcorn&quot; [&#x27;pɒʔpkɔːn], &quot;electric&quot; [ɪ&#x27;leʔktrɪk], &quot;butcher&quot; [&#x27;bʊʔtʃə].
Wells proposes that in transcribing EE, the glottal stop symbol [ʔ] could be used in contexts where the consonant in question is preceded by a vowel and followed by a consonant or the end of a word: examples are &quot;bit&quot; [bɪʔ], &quot;football&quot; [ˈfʊʔbɔo], &quot;belt&quot; [beoʔ], &quot;Cheltenham&quot; [ˈtʃeoʔnəm], &quot;bent&quot; [benʔ], &quot;Bentley&quot; [ˈbenʔli].
Pre-glottalization of /t/ therefore appears to be present both in RP and in EE.

Glottal &quot;replacement&quot; of /t/ may be found when /t/ occurs before another consonant. Examples from RP where /t/ is replaced by a glottal stop are: &quot;that table&quot; [ðæʔ &#x27;teɪbəl], &quot;Scotland&quot; [&#x27;skɒʔlənd], &quot;witness&quot; [&#x27;wɪʔnəs]. The most extreme case of glottal replacement is when a glottal stop takes the place of /t/ between vowels (normally when the preceding vowel is stressed). Examples are &quot;not on&quot; [ˌnɒʔ &#x27;ɒn], &quot;bottle&quot; [&#x27;bɒʔo]. Wells says &quot;glottalling word-internally before a vowel is well-known as a &#x27;rough&#x27; pronunciation variant: thus EE water ˈwɔːtə, but Cockney ˈwɔʊʔə&quot;. However, in work published twenty years later, Cruttenden (p 184) remarks that such glottal replacement &quot;was until recently stigmatized as non-GB but all except [ʔl̩] are now acceptable in London RGB&quot; (i.e. EE). He continues &quot;Use of [ʔ] for /t/ word-medially intervocalically, as in &quot;water&quot;, still remains stigmatized in GB&quot;.

====Diphthong shift====
EE is said to exhibit diphthong shift, particularly of the FACE, PRICE, MOUTH and GOAT vowels (informal example: &quot;nime&quot; for &quot;name&quot;).
* (as in ) may be realised in a couple of different ways. According to , it is any of the following: , , or . The last two are more often used by females. She also notes a fully rounded diphthong (found in some speakers from Essex), as well as two rare monophthongal realizations, namely and . 
* (as in ), can be realised as , , or , with and being predominant. it can also be realised as , or .
* (as in ) can be realised as , , , , or .
* (as in ) can be realised as , , , or . denotes a front onset , not a central one .
* &quot;Board&quot; may be pronounced differently from &quot;bored&quot; . (phonetically or ) appears before consonants, and (phonetically or ) appears at a morpheme boundary. However, states that both and may have the same monophthongal quality .

====Yod-coalescence====

Yod-coalescence is found in EE: the use of the affricates and instead of the clusters and in words like &quot;dune&quot; and &quot;Tuesday&quot; results in the words sounding like &quot;June&quot; and &quot;choose day&quot;, respectively. Although at the time when most studies of EE were carried out, yod-coalescence was not common in RP, it has now become so widely accepted that RP-based pronunciation dictionaries include it. Thus the latest edition of the Cambridge English Pronouncing Dictionary gives /dʒuːn/ and /tʃuːz.deɪ/ as the preferred pronunciations; the Longman Pronunciation Dictionary and the Oxford Dictionary of Pronunciation give /djuːn/ and /tjuːzdeɪ/ as their first preference, but give /dʒuːn/ and /tʃuːz.deɪ/ as second preference. It cannot be said that the presence of yod-coalescence distinguishes EE from RP.

====&quot;th&quot;-fronting====
It has been suggested that &quot;th&quot;-fronting is &quot;currently making its way&quot; into Estuary English, for example those from the Isle of Thanet often refer to Thanet as &quot;Plannit Fannit&quot; (Planet Thanet). However, this feature was also present in the traditional dialect of Essex before the spread of Estuary English.

====Other vowel differences====

* (as in ) can be realised as , or , with the first two variants predominating. Before the dark l, it is sometimes a center diphthong .
* (as in ) can be realised in many different ways, such as monophthongs , , , , , and diphthongs , , and . Front pronunciations (, , and ) are more often encountered in female speakers. Before dark /l/, it is always back.
* /ʊ/ (as in FOOT) can be realised as ʉ], ɨ], ʏ] or ʊ], as in RP. Only the last variant appears before a dark l. 
* (as in ), according to , can be pronounced in two different ways: diphthongal in closed syllables and or in open syllables and monophthongal . According to , it is either or before consonants, and either or at a morpheme boundary.
* (as in ) can be realised as , , , or , with being predominant. The first two variants occur mostly before . The last two variants are more often used by females.
* (as in ) can be realised as , , , or .

===Features distinguishing EE from Cockney===
Wells suggests that EE differs from Cockney in a few key features.
* EE differs from Cockney in usually not being characterized by h-dropping before stressed vowels (informal example: &quot; &#x27;and on &#x27;eart&quot; for &quot;hand on heart&quot;)
* Th-fronting (e.g. &quot;I fink&quot; for &quot;I think&quot;, but see above)
* Cockney may have monophthongal realization of the MOUTH vowel (&quot;Sahfend&quot; for &quot;Southend&quot;).

==Use==
Estuary English is widely encountered throughout southeast England, particularly among the young. It is considered to be a working-class accent, although often used by the lower middle classes too. In the debate that surrounded a 1993 article about Estuary English, a London businessman claimed that RP was perceived as unfriendly, so Estuary English was now preferred for commercial purposes. 
Some adopt the accent as a means of &quot;blending in&quot; to appear to be more working class or in an attempt to appear to be &quot;a common man&quot;. That affectation of the accent is sometimes derisively referred to as &quot;Mockney&quot;. A move away from traditional RP accents is almost universal among middle-class young people in the South-East of England.

==19th-century Rural Estuary English==

Older rural dialects of the Estuary region survived longest in areas like Kent and the east of Essex, which early on showed features of, as well as some features distinct from, the modern Estuary dialect that has since become regionally widespread. Notably, rhoticity was a feature of older rural English in most of the Estuary counties, now largely replaced by non-rhoticity.

<doc id="106505" wikidata="Q487921" url="?curid=106505" title="Calw">
<text>Calw (; previously pronounced and sometimes spelled Kalb accordingly; ) is a town in the middle of Baden-Württemberg in the south of Germany, capital and largest town of the district Calw. It is located in the Northern Black Forest and is approximately south of Pforzheim and west of Stuttgart. It has the status of a &quot;große Kreisstadt.&quot;

==Geography==

===Location===
Calw is located in the valley of the Nagold in the Northern Black Forest at an altitude between above sea level. The historic centre lies west of the river. The newer parts of town have developed on the surrounding slopes. The following streams also exist within the town: the Tälesbach, Ziegelbach, Wurstbrunnenbach, Schießbach, Schlittenbach und Schweinbach. In the northern part of the town, on the western slope of the Nagold valley is the cave known as the Bruderhöhle.

===Neighbouring Communities===
The following towns and communities (&quot;Gemeinden&quot;) border on the town of Calw (clockwise, from the north): Bad Liebenzell, Althengstett, Gechingen, Wildberg, Neubulach, Bad Teinach-Zavelstein, Neuweiler, Bad Wildbad and Oberreichenbach (all in the Calw district).

===Subdivisions===
Calw has 13 subdivisions known as &quot;Stadtteile&quot; (quarters or neighborhoods): Altburg, Oberriedt, Speßhardt, Spindlershof, Weltenschwann, Calw, Alzenberg, Heumaden, Wimberg, Hirsau, Ernstmühl, Holzbronn und Stammheim. The subdivision known as Calw corresponds to the historic town centre. The following subdivisions are centered on historic villages: Altburg, Alzenberg, Hirsau, Holzbronn, and Stammheim.

===Climate===
== History ==
Calw was first mentioned in records in 1037. In the 11th century, the town grew around the older castle of the &quot;&quot; (Counts/Earls) of Calw. In the Middle Ages, Calw was an important commercial town, especially in the cloth and leather trades. In 1345, Calw became part of Württemberg, and by the 16th century, it had become the summer residence of the Dukes of Württemberg. In the 18th century, Calw flourished from the lumber trade and rafting of timber on the river Nagold.
In 1945, a small subcamp of Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp, where parts for aircraft were assembled by female Jewish forced laborers, was located here.

After the World War II, Calw fell into the French zone of occupation and thus came to the newly founded state of Württemberg-Hohenzollern in 1947. In 1952, the provisional post-war state in the administrative region of South Württemberg-Hohenzollern merged and has since belonged to the new state of Baden-Württemberg.

The most prominent resident of Calw was the author and Nobel prize winner Hermann Hesse.

The district reform of 1 January 1973 gave the district of Calw its current size. It became a part of the newly founded Northern Black Forest Region, which itself was assigned to the administrative region of Karlsruhe. On 1 January 1975, Calw was combined with the communities of Altburg, Hirsau and Stammheim into the town of Calw-Hirsau. On 1 January 1976, the combined municipality was renamed as Calw.

===Religious History===

Calw was originally part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Speyer. From 1534, in Calw as in the rest of the Duchy of Württemberg, the Reformation took force. In 1555, Calw became the seat of a deanery, which still exists today. The Deanery of Calw encompasses 43 congregations of the Evangelical-Lutheran Church in Württemberg. In the town of Calw there is the greater congregation of Calw, comprising the town-centre congregation (Calw Stadtkirche), the Bergkirche congregation of Wimberg/Alzenberg, and the Versöhnungskirche congregation of Heumaden, of which the last two came into existence only after the arrival of &quot;Heimatvertriebene&quot; after World War II. There are also congregations in the villages of Altburg, Hirsau, Holzbronn und Stammheim.

There is also a congregation of the United Methodist Church, an independent Protestant church, in Calw.

In the 19th century, Catholics returned to Calw. In 1885–1886, they founded the parish of St. Josef, which later became the seat of a deanery within the diocese of Rottenburg (today Rottenburg-Stuttgart). The parish of St. Josef covers the entire territory of the town as well as several surrounding communities.

The New Apostolic Church is represented in Calw and in the villages or hamlets of Heumaden, Holzbronn, and . A congregation of Seventh-day Adventists was founded in Calw in 1914.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms of the town of Calw shows a red lion with a blue tongue and blue crown standing atop a blue hill with three ridges, all against a golden background. The town flag is red-gold. The lion on the three-ridged hill is the coat of arms of the counts of Calw, the former lords of the town. The coat of arms has been used for centuries and was reapproved for use by the state government when the town was expanded in 1976.

==Economy==
More than 8,000 people are employed in Calw, of which more than 5,200 work in the service sector and around 2,700 in the goods-producing sector.

==Transport==
Calw is served by &quot;Bundesstraßen&quot; (federal highways) 295, 296 und 463. Climbing out of the Nagold valley toward Stuttgart, Bundesstraße 296 has two lanes. This 2.7 km section thereby makes it possible to pass slower vehicles in two switchbacks.

The Nagold Valley Railway, which runs from Pforzheim to Hochdorf in Nagold, has two stops in Calw: the new Calw Station, which is adjacent to the central bus station, as well as a stop in Hirsau. The former Calw Station, which stood outside the town centre, was removed from service. The imposing station hall has been converted to other uses. It was formerly a connecting station for the Black Forest Railway to Stuttgart, whose western extension to Calw was closed in 1988. Since the purchase by Calw District in 1994 of the closed railway section to Weil der Stadt, the district has been pushing for a restoration of service as part of the Hermann Hesse Railway project.

Several bus lines provide public transportation. Buses of the agencies Regional Bus Stuttgart, Däuble Reisen, Bolz Reisen, and SüdwestBus offer connections to Unterreichenbach, Böblingen, Sindelfingen and Weil der Stadt (Regional Bus Stuttgart) as well as to Herrenberg (Däuble Reisen).

==Government and military==
Calw is the seat of the district council of Calw District. There is also a tax office a local court, which belongs to the judicial districts of the state court Tübingen and of the superior state court of Stuttgart.

The Kommando Spezialkräfte (Special Operations Forces) of the German Army has been stationed since 1996 in the Graf Zeppelin barracks (&quot;Graf-Zeppelin-Kaserne&quot;) near Heumaden in Calw.

== Culture, art, and tourism ==

Calw has a small historic centre that was largely untouched by the last war. Many guests visit the town&#x27;s marketplace and the Nikolausbrücke (a historic bridge). Calw has begun catering to the tourist trade, with numerous shops, restaurants, bistros and ice-cream parlours.

In the 1970s part of the historic centre was replaced with a shopping centre. Soon after, the town centre was closed off and established as a pedestrian zone. Buildings with exposed concrete (bus station, parking garage) have marked the part of the town centre facing the Nagold for years. A shopping centre built around 2000 borders the historic centre to the north.

One of the cultural high points of the calendar in Calw is the Calw Hermann Hesse Prize. Every other year it honors literary journals and translators that have focused on the work of Hermann Hesse. In the Hermann Hesse Colloquium, current issues having to do with Hermann Hesse are discussed in Calw by international experts. Every year in the Benedictine ruins of the Monastery of St. Peter und Paul the theatre festival &quot;Calwer Klostersommer in Hirsau&quot; (Calw Monastery Summer in Hirsau) takes place. This replaced the Klosterspiele Hirsau (Monastery Plays of Hirsau), which were rich in tradition. Hermann Hesse&#x27;s Gerbersau stories provide the material for the yearly &quot;Gerbersauer Lesesommer“ (Gerbersau Reading Summer). Stories and anecdotes are read from more than three dozen stories and reflections of Hermann Hesse about life in Gerbersau, his literary pseudonym for Calw. A feature of the reading series is the frequent use of settings from Hesse&#x27;s life. A cultural strength of the Hesse Town is music; worth mentioning are the Aurelius-Sängerknaben (Aurelius Boys&#x27; Choir), whose fame extends far beyond the borders of Baden-Württemberg. Further musical features include concert series in the Evangelical Lutheran Stadtkirche (Town Church) and in the St. Aurelius Church.

<text>A rubber-tyred metro or rubber-tired metro is a form of rapid transit system that uses a mix of road and rail technology. The vehicles have wheels with rubber tires that run on a roll way inside guide bars for traction. Traditional, flanged steel wheels running on rail tracks provide guidance through switches and act as backup if tyres fail. Most rubber-tyred trains are purpose-built and designed for the system on which they operate. Guided buses are sometimes referred to as &#x27;trams on tyres&#x27;, and compared to rubber-tyred metros.

==History==
The first idea for rubber-tyred railway vehicles was the work of Scotsman Robert William Thomson, the original inventor of the pneumatic tyre. In his patent of 1846 he describes his &#x27;Aerial Wheels&#x27; as being equally suitable for, &quot;the ground or rail or track on which they run&quot;. The patent also included a drawing of such a railway, with the weight carried by pneumatic main wheels running on a flat board track and guidance provided by small horizontal steel wheels running on the sides of a central vertical guide rail. A similar arrangement was patented by Alejandro Goicoechea, inventor of Talgo, in February 1936, patent ES 141056. In 1973, he built a development of that patent: &#x27;Tren Vertebrado&#x27;, Patent DE1755198; at Avenida Marítima, in Las Palmas de Gran Canaria.

During the World War II German occupation of Paris, the Metro system was used to capacity, with relatively little maintenance performed. At the end of the war, the system was so worn that thought was given as to how to renovate it. Rubber-tyred metro technology was first applied to the Paris Métro, developed by Michelin, which provided the tyres and guidance system, in collaboration with Renault, which provided the vehicles. Starting in 1951, an experimental vehicle, the MP 51, operated on a test track between Porte des Lilas and Pré Saint Gervais, a section of line not open to the public.

Line 11 Châtelet – Mairie des Lilas was the first line to be converted, in 1956, chosen because of its steep grades. That was followed by Line 1 Château de Vincennes – Pont de Neuilly in 1964, and Line 4 Porte d&#x27;Orléans – Porte de Clignancourt in 1967, converted because they had the heaviest traffic load of all Paris Métro lines. Finally, Line 6 Charles de Gaulle – Étoile – Nation was converted in 1974, to reduce train noise on its many elevated sections. Because of the high cost of converting existing rail-based lines, other lines were not converted, but the new Paris Métro Line 14, which opened in 1998, was built with the rubber-tyred system.

The first completely rubber-tyred metro system was built in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, in 1966. The trains of the Santiago and Mexico City Metros are based on those of the Paris Métro. A few more recent rubber-tyred systems have used automated, driverless trains. One of the first such systems, developed by Matra, opened in 1983 in Lille, and others have since been built in Toulouse and Rennes. Paris Metro Line 14 was automated from its beginning (1998), and Line 1 was converted to automatic operation in 2007–2011. The first automated rubber-tyred system in Kobe, Japan, opened in February 1981. It is the Port Liner, linking Sannomiya railway station with Port Island.

==Technology==

===Overview===

Trains are usually in the form of electric multiple units. Just as on a conventional railway, the driver does not have to steer, with the system relying on some sort of guideway to direct the train. The type of guideway varies between networks. Most use two parallel roll ways, each the width of a tyre, which are made of various materials. The Montreal Metro, Lille Metro, Toulouse Metro, and most parts of Santiago Metro, use concrete. The Busan Subway Line 4 employs a concrete slab. The Paris Métro, Mexico City Metro, and the non-underground section of Santiago Metro, use H-Shaped hot rolled steel, and the Sapporo Municipal Subway uses flat steel. The Sapporo system and Lille Metro use a single central guide rail only.

On some systems, such those in Paris, Montreal, and Mexico City, there is a conventional railway track between the roll ways. The bogies of the train include railway wheels with longer flanges than normal. These conventional wheels are normally just above the rails, but come into use in the case of a flat tyre, or at switches (points) and crossings. In Paris these rails were also used to enable mixed traffic, with rubber-tyred and steel-wheeled trains using the same track, particularly during conversion from normal railway track. The VAL system, used in Lille and Toulouse, has other sorts of flat-tyre compensation and switching methods.

On most systems, the electric power is supplied from one of the guide bars, which serves as a third rail. The current is picked up by a separate lateral pickup shoe. The return current passes via a return shoe to one or both of the conventional railway tracks, which are part of most systems, or to the other guide bar.
Rubber tyres have higher rolling resistance than traditional steel railway wheels. There are some advantages and disadvantages to increased rolling resistance, causing them to not be used in certain countries.

===Advantages===

Compared to steel wheel on steel rail, the advantages of rubber-tyred metro systems are:
* Faster acceleration, along with the ability to climb or descend steeper slopes (approximately a gradient of 13%) than would be feasible with conventional rail tracks, which would likely need a rack instead.
** For example, the rubber-tyred Line 2 of the Lausanne Metro has grades of up to 12%.
* Shorter braking distances, allowing trains to be signalled closer together.
* Quieter rides in open air (both inside and outside the train).
* Greatly reduced rail wear with resulting reduced maintenance costs of those parts.

===Disadvantages===
The higher friction and increased rolling resistance cause disadvantages (compared to steel wheel on steel rail):
* Higher energy consumption.
*Worse ride, when compared with well-maintained steel-on-steel systems.
* Possibility of tyre blow-outs - not possible in railway wheels.
* Higher cost of maintenance and manufacture.
* Normal operation generates more heat (from friction).
* Weather variance. &quot;(Applicable only to above-ground installations)&quot;
** Loss of the traction-advantage in inclement weather (snow and ice).
* Same expense of steel rails for switching purposes, to provide electricity or grounding to the trains and as a safety backup.
* Tyres that frequently need to be replaced, contrary to rails using steel wheels, which need to be replaced less often.
* Tyres break down during use and turn into particulate matter (dust), which can be hazardous air pollution, also coating surrounding surfaces in dirty rubber dust.

Although it is a more complex technology, most rubber-tyred metro systems use quite simple techniques, in contrast to guided buses. Heat dissipation is an issue as eventually all traction energy consumed by the train — except the electric energy regenerated back into the substation during electrodynamic braking — will end up in losses (mostly heat). In frequently operated tunnels (typical metro operation) the extra heat from rubber tyres is a widespread problem, necessitating ventilation of the tunnels. As a result, some rubber-tyred metro systems do not have air-conditioned trains, as air conditioning would heat the tunnels to temperatures where operation is not possible.

==Similar technologies==
Automated driverless systems are not exclusively rubber-tyred; many have since been built using conventional rail technology, such as London&#x27;s Docklands Light Railway, the Copenhagen metro and Vancouver&#x27;s SkyTrain, the Hong Kong Disneyland Resort line, which uses converted rolling stocks from non-driverless trains, as well as AirTrain JFK, which links JFK Airport in New York City with local subway and commuter trains. Most monorail manufacturers prefer rubber tyres.

<text>The Jameson Raid (Afrikaans: &quot;Jameson-inval&quot;, , 29 December 1895 – 2 January 1896) was a botched raid against the South African Republic (commonly known as the Transvaal) carried out by British colonial administrator Leander Starr Jameson, under the employment of Cecil Rhodes. It involved 500 British South Africa Company police and was launched from Rhodesia over the New Year weekend of 1895–96. Paul Kruger, for whom Rhodes had great personal hatred, was president of the South African Republic at the time. The raid was intended to trigger an uprising by the primarily British expatriate workers (known as Uitlanders) in the Transvaal but it failed. 

The workers were referred to as the Johannesburg Conspirators. They were expected to recruit an army and prepare for an insurrection; however, the raid was ineffective, and no uprising took place. The results included embarrassment of the British government; the replacement of Cecil Rhodes as prime minister of the Cape Colony; and the strengthening of Boer dominance of the Transvaal and its gold mines. Also, the withdrawal of so many fighting men left Rhodesia vulnerable, one factor that led just a couple of months later to the Second Matabele War. The raid was a contributory cause of the Second Boer War.

== Background ==

What later became the nation of South Africa was not politically unified in the late nineteenth century. The territory had four distinct entities: the two British colonies of Cape Colony and Natal; and the two Boer republics of the Orange Free State and the South African Republic, more commonly referred to as the Transvaal.

=== Foundation of the colonies and republics ===

The Cape, more specifically the small area around present day Cape Town, was the first part of South Africa to be settled by Europeans. The arrival of Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama at Calicut, India, in 1498 opened a gateway of free access to Asia from Western Europe around the Cape of Good Hope; however, it also necessitated the founding and safeguarding of trade stations in the East. The Portuguese landed in Mossel Bay in 1500, explored Table Bay two years later, and by 1510 had started raiding inland. Shortly afterwards, the Dutch Republic sent merchant vessels to India and, in 1602, founded the Dutch East India Company (; VOC). As the volume of traffic rounding the Cape increased, the VOC recognised its natural harbour as an ideal watering point for the long voyage around Africa to the Orient and established a victualling station there in 1652. 

VOC officials did not favour the permanent settlement of Europeans in their trading empire, although during the 140 years of Dutch rule many VOC servants retired or were discharged and remained as private citizens. A small number of longtime VOC employees, however, expressed interest in applying for grants of land with the objective of retiring at the Cape as farmers. In time, they came to form a class of former VOC employees, &quot;vrijlieden&quot;, also known as &quot;vrijburgers&quot; (free citizens) who stayed in Dutch territories overseas after serving their contracts. From 1688 onward, the Cape also attracted some French Huguenots, most of them refugees from the protracted conflict between Protestants and Catholics in France, as well as smaller numbers of Flemish, French Huguenot, German, Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish immigrants. Over generations, this settled European population came to form a distinct identity as Afrikaners (formerly sometimes or , from the Dutch ) or Boers (farmers).

In 1806, the Cape was colonised by the British Empire. Initially British control was aimed to protect the trade route to the East from Napoleon, however, the British soon realised the potential to develop the Cape colony further. Antipathy towards British control and the introduction of new systems and institutions grew amongst a substantial portion of the Afrikaner/Boer community. Between 1834 and 1840 about 15 000 Boers left the Cape Colony in parties of ox-wagons, in seek of sovereignty beyond British-claimed territories. These emigrants primarily consisted Trekboers, frontier farmers in the East who had been at the front of the colony&#x27;s eastward expansion. The emigration became known as the Great Trek and the emigrants &quot;Voortrekkers&quot;. Details on the various motives behind the Great Trek are laid out in the Voortrekker leader, Piet Retief&#x27;s 1837 manifesto. 

The Voortrekkers first moved east into the territory later known as Natal. In 1839, they founded the Natalia Republic as a new Boer homeland. Other Voortrekker parties moved north, settling beyond the Orange and Vaal rivers.

Disregarding the Voortrekkers&#x27; effortful attempt to claim independence, Britain annexed the Natalia Republic in 1843, which became the Crown colony of Natal. After 1843, British government policy turned strongly against further expansion in South Africa. Although there were some abortive attempts to annex more territories to the north, Britain formally recognised their independence by the Sand River Convention of 1852 and the Orange River Convention of 1854, for the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, respectively.
After the First Anglo-Boer War, Gladstone&#x27;s government restored the Transvaal&#x27;s independence in 1884 by signing the London Convention, not knowing that the colossal gold deposits of the Witwatersrand would be struck two years later by Jan Gerrit Bantjes (1843-1911).

=== Economics ===

In spite of the political divisions, the four territories were strongly linked. Each was populated by European-African emigrants from the Cape; many citizens had relatives or friends in other territories. As the largest and oldest state in Southern Africa, the Cape was economically, culturally, and socially dominant; the population of Natal and the two Boer republics were mostly subsistence farmers.

The fairly simple agricultural dynamic was upset in 1870, when vast diamond fields were discovered in Griqualand West, around modern-day Kimberley. Although the territory had historically come under the authority of the Orange Free State, the Cape government, with the assistance of the British government, annexed the area.

=== Discovery of gold ===

In June 1884, Jan Gerrit Bantjes (1843–1914) discovered signs of gold at Vogelstruisfontein (the first gold sold directly to Cecil Rhodes at Bantjes&#x27;s camp for £3,000) followed in September by the Struben brothers at Wilgespruit near Roodepoort which started the Witwatersrand Gold Rush and modern-day Johannesburg. The first gold mines of the Witwatersrand were the Bantjes Consolidated Mines. By 1886 it was clear that there were massive deposits of gold in the main reef. The huge inflow of &quot;Uitlanders&quot; (foreigners), mainly from Britain, had come to the region in search of employment and fortune. The discovery of gold made the Transvaal overnight the richest and potentially the most powerful nation in southern Africa, but it attracted so many Uitlanders (in 1896 approximately 60,000) that they quickly outnumbered the Boers (approximately 30,000 white male Boers).

Fearful of the Transvaal&#x27;s losing independence and becoming a British colony, the Boer government adopted policies of protectionism and exclusion, to include restrictions requiring Uitlanders to be resident for at least four years in the Transvaal to obtain the franchise, or right to vote. They heavily taxed the growing gold mining industry which was predominantly British and American. Due to this taxation, the Uitlanders became increasingly resentful and aggrieved about the lack of representation. President Paul Kruger called a closed council, including Jan Gerrit Bantjes, to discuss the growing problem and it was decided to put a heavy tax on the sale of dynamite to non-Boer residents. Jan G. Bantjes, fluent in both spoken and written Dutch and English, was a close confidant of Paul Kruger with their link dating to the Great Trek days. Jan&#x27;s father, Jan Gerritze Bantjes, had given Paul Kruger his elementary education during the trek and Jan Gerritse was part of his inner core of associates. This closed council would be the committee which set the Transvaal Republic on a collision course with Great Britain and the Anglo-Boer War 1899-1902 and which set German feelings toward Britain at boiling point by siding with the Boers. Because of this applied dynamite tax, considerable discontent and tensions began to rise. As Johannesburg was largely an Uitlander city, non-boer leaders there began to discuss the proposals for an insurrection.

Cecil Rhodes, Prime Minister of the Cape Colony, had a desire to incorporate the Transvaal and the Orange Free State in a federation under British control. Having combined his commercial mining interests with Alfred Beit to form the De Beers Mining Corporation, the two men also wanted to control the Johannesburg gold mining industry. They played a major role in fomenting Uitlander grievances.

Rhodes later told the journalist W.T. Stead that he feared that a Uitlander rebellion would cause trouble for Britain if not controlled by him:

In mid-1895, Rhodes planned a raid by an armed column from Rhodesia, the British colony to the north, to support an uprising of Uitlanders with the goal of taking control. The raid soon ran into difficulties, beginning with hesitation by the Uitlander leaders.

=== Drifts Crisis ===

In September and October 1895, a dispute between the Transvaal and Cape Colony governments arose over Boer trade protectionism. The Cape Colony had refused to pay the high rates charged by the Transvaal government for use of the Transvaal portion of the railway line to Johannesburg, instead opting to send its goods by wagon train directly across the Vaal River, over a set of fords (known as &#x27;drifts&#x27; in South Africa). Transvaal president Paul Kruger responded by closing the drifts, angering the Cape Colony government. While Transvaal eventually relented, relations between the nation and Cape Colony remained strained.

== Jameson force and the initiation of the raid ==

As part of the planning, a force had been placed at Pitsani, on the border of the Transvaal, by the order of Rhodes so as to be able to quickly offer support to the Uitlanders in the uprising. The force was placed under the control of Leander Starr Jameson, the administrator general of the chartered company (of which Cecil Rhodes was the chairman) for Matabeleland. Among the other commanders was Raleigh Grey. The force was around 600 men, about 400 from the Matabeleland Mounted Police and the remainder other volunteers. It was equipped with rifles, somewhere between eight and sixteen Maxim machine guns, and between three and eleven light artillery pieces.

The plan was that Johannesburg would revolt and seize the Boer armoury in Pretoria. Jameson and his force would dash across the border to Johannesburg to &quot;restore order&quot; and with control of Johannesburg would control the gold fields.

However, while Jameson waited for the insurrection to begin, differences arose within the Reform Committee and between Johannesburg Uitlander reformers regarding the form of government to be adopted after the coup. At a point, certain reformers contacted Jameson to inform him of the difficulties and advised him to stand down. Jameson, with 600 restless men and other pressures, became frustrated by the delays and, believing that he could spur the reluctant Johannesburg reformers to act, decided to go ahead. He sent a telegram on 28 December 1895 to Rhodes warning him of his intentions – &quot;Unless I hear definitely to the contrary, shall leave to-morrow evening&quot; – and on the very next day sent a further message, &quot;Shall leave to-night for the Transvaal&quot;. However, the transmission of the first telegram was delayed, so that both arrived at the same time on the morning of 29 December, and by then Jameson&#x27;s men had cut the telegraph wires and there was no way of recalling him.

On 29 December 1895, Jameson&#x27;s armed column crossed into the Transvaal and headed for Johannesburg. They hoped that this would be a three-day dash to Johannesburg before the Boer commandos could mobilise, and would trigger an uprising by the Uitlanders.

The British Colonial Secretary, Joseph Chamberlain, though sympathetic to the ultimate goals of the raid, realized it would be a mistake since the uitlanders were not supportive. He immediately tried to stop it, remarking that &quot;if this succeeds it will ruin me. I&#x27;m going up to London to crush it&quot;. He rushed back to London and ordered Sir Hercules Robinson, governor of the Cape Colony, to repudiate the actions of Jameson and warned Rhodes that the company&#x27;s charter would be in danger if it were discovered the Cape Prime Minister was involved in the raid. Chamberlain therefore instructed local British representatives to call on British colonists not to offer any aid to the raiders.

Although Jameson&#x27;s men had cut the telegraph wires to Cape Town, they had failed to cut the telegraph wires to Pretoria (cutting a fence by mistake). Accordingly, news of his incursion quickly reached Pretoria and Jameson&#x27;s armed column was tracked by Transvaal forces from the moment that it crossed the border. The Jameson armed column first encountered resistance very early on 1 January when there was a very brief exchange of fire with a Boer outpost. Around noon the Jameson armed column was around twenty miles further on, at Krugersdorp, where a small force of Boer soldiers had blocked the road to Johannesburg and dug in and prepared defensive positions. Jameson&#x27;s force spent some hours exchanging fire with the Boers, losing several men and many horses in the skirmish. Towards evening the Jameson armed column withdrew and turned south-east attempting to flank the Boer force. The Boers tracked the move overnight and on 2 January, as the light improved, a substantial Boer force with some artillery was waiting for Jameson at Doornkop. The tired raiders initially exchanged fire with the Boers, losing around thirty men before Jameson realized the position was hopeless and surrendered to Commandant Piet Cronjé. The raiders were taken to Pretoria and jailed.

== Aftermath ==
The Boer government later handed the men over to the British for trial and the British prisoners were returned to London. A few days after the raid, the Kaiser of Germany sent a telegram (the &quot;Kruger telegram&quot;) congratulating President Kruger and the Transvaal government on their success &quot;without the help of friendly powers&quot;, alluding to potential support by Germany. When this was disclosed in the British press, it raised a storm of anti-German feeling. Dr. Jameson was lionised by the press and London society, inflamed by anti-Boer and anti-German feeling and in a frenzy of jingoism. Jameson was sentenced to 15 months for leading the raid, which he served in Holloway. The Transvaal government was paid almost £1 million in compensation by the British South Africa Company.

For conspiring with Jameson, the members of the Reform Committee (Transvaal), including Colonel Frank Rhodes and John Hays Hammond, were jailed in deplorable conditions, found guilty of high treason, and sentenced to death by hanging. This sentence was later commuted to 15 years&#x27; imprisonment, and in June 1896, all surviving members of the committee were released on payment of stiff fines. As further punishment for his support of Jameson, the highly decorated Col. Rhodes was placed on the retired list by the British Army and barred from active involvement in army business. After his release from jail, Colonel Rhodes immediately joined his brother Cecil and the British South Africa Company in the Second Matabele War taking place just north of the Transvaal in Matabeleland. Cecil Rhodes was forced to resign as Prime Minister of Cape Colony in 1896 due to his apparent involvement in planning and assisting in the raid; he also, along with Alfred Beit, resigned as a director of the British South Africa Company.

Jameson&#x27;s raid had depleted Matabeleland of many of its troops and left the whole territory vulnerable. Seizing on this weakness, and a discontent with the British South Africa Company, the Ndebele revolted during March 1896 in what is now celebrated in Zimbabwe as the First War of Independence, the First Chimurenga, but it is better known to most of the world as the Second Matabele War. The Shona joined them soon thereafter. Hundreds of European settlers were killed within the first few weeks of the revolt and many more would die over the next year and a half. With few troops to support them, the settlers had to quickly build a laager in the centre of Bulawayo on their own. Against over 50,000 Ndebele held up in their stronghold of the Matobo Hills the settlers mounted patrols under such people as Burnham, Baden-Powell, and Selous. It would not be until October 1897 that the Ndebele and Shona would finally lay down their arms.

== Political impact ==

In Britain the Liberal Party objected to, and later opposed, the Boer War. Later, Jameson became Prime Minister of the Cape Colony (1904–08) and one of the founders of the Union of South Africa. He was made a baronet in 1911 and returned to England in 1912. On his death in 1917, he was buried next to Cecil Rhodes and the 34 BSAC soldiers of the Shangani Patrol (killed in 1893 in the First Matabele War) in the Matobos Hills, near Bulawayo.

== Effect on Anglo-Boer relations ==

The affair brought Anglo-Boer relations to a dangerous low. Tensions were further exacerbated by the &quot;Kruger telegram&quot; from the German, Kaiser Wilhelm II congratulating Kruger on defeating the &quot;raiders&quot;. The German telegram came to be widely interpreted as an offer of military aid to the Boers. Wilhelm was already perceived by many as anti-British after initiating a costly naval arms race between Germany and Britain.
As tensions quickly mounted, the Transvaal began importing large quantities of arms and signed an alliance with the Orange Free State in 1897. Jan C. Smuts wrote in 1906 of the Raid, &quot;The Jameson Raid was the real declaration of war... And that is so in spite of the four years of truce that followed... [the] aggressors consolidated their alliance... the defenders on the other hand silently and grimly prepared for the inevitable.&quot;

Joseph Chamberlain condemned the raid despite previously having approved Rhodes&#x27; plans to send armed assistance in the case of a Johannesburg uprising. In London, despite some condemnation by the print-media, most newspapers used the episode as an opportunity to whip-up anti-Boer feelings. Though they faced criminal charges in London for their actions in South Africa, Jameson and his raiders were treated as heroes by much of the popular public. Chamberlain welcomed the escalation by Transvaal as an opportunity to annex the Boer states.

== Modern reactions ==
To this day, Jameson&#x27;s involvement in the Jameson Raid remains something of an enigma, being somewhat out-of-character with his prior history, the rest of his life and successful later political career. In 2002, The Van Riebeeck Society published Sir Graham Bower&#x27;s &quot;Secret History of the Jameson Raid and the South African Crisis, 1895–1902&quot; (edited by Deryck Schreuder and Jeffrey Butler, Van Riebeeck Society, Cape Town, Second Series No. 33), adding to growing historical evidence that the imprisonment and judgement upon the Raiders at the time of their trial was unjust, in view of what has appeared, in later historical analysis, to have been the calculated political manoeuvres by Joseph Chamberlain and his staff to hide his own involvement and knowledge of the Raid.

In a 2004 review of Sir Graham Bower&#x27;s account, Alan Cousins commented that &quot;A number of major themes and concerns emerge&quot; from Bower&#x27;s history, &quot;perhaps the most poignant being Bower’s accounts of his being made a scapegoat in the aftermath of the raid: &#x27;since a scapegoat was wanted I was willing to serve my country in that capacity&#x27;.&quot;

Cousins writes of Bower that:

<doc id="106517" wikidata="Q5660104" url="?curid=106517" title="Harold Bishop">
<text>Harold Wayne Bishop is a fictional character from the Australian soap opera &quot;Neighbours&quot;, played by Ian Smith. The actor was offered the role by the show&#x27;s creator and executive producer Reg Watson. Smith made his first screen appearance as Harold during the episode broadcast on 30 January 1987. He departed in September 1991, but returned five years later in October 1996. Harold remained on screen for over twelve years, becoming one of the longest-running characters in the show&#x27;s history.

Smith announced his departure from &quot;Neighbours&quot; in August 2008. Following a cancer storyline, Harold made his final appearance on 27 February 2009. In December 2010, Smith revealed that he would be reprising his role and Harold returned on 9 May 2011. During his brief return stint, Harold married Carolyn Johnstone (Paula Duncan), a storyline that was suggested by Smith. The character of Harold has been well received by critics and Smith earned various award nominations for his performance, including the Most Popular Personality on Australian Television Logie Award. Harold returned again in February 2015, ahead of the show&#x27;s 30th anniversary. Smith reprised his role for the and began filming in February 2022. Harold returned to the role for a guest arc as part of the series&#x27; continuation, via Amazon Freevee. On 18 September 2023, Harold returned in episode 8904, and departed again on 10 October 2023. He returned to the show on a permanent basis on 28 May 2024. On 2 December 2024, Smith announced that he had been diagnosed with a rare form of aggressive lung cancer, and that he would be leaving the show for good.

==Casting==
The show&#x27;s creator and then executive producer Reg Watson offered Ian Smith the role of Harold, following the end of his television drama &quot;Prisoner&quot;, with which Smith had been a script editor and associate producer. After agreeing to the role, Smith also asked if he could write for the show too. Smith was only supposed to be in &quot;Neighbours&quot; for five weeks, but a couple of weeks after he had finished filming, Smith was asked back. Smith admitted that he was not prepared for how popular the show would become, saying &quot;I naively thought I was signing on for a frothy little soap that would come and go as most of them do. I had no inkling of the international success that lay in store for &quot;Neighbours&quot;.&quot; Comedian Peter Moon revealed in 2009 that he had originally auditioned for the role of Harold. Moon said &quot;Ian Smith beat me to it, so it is kind of weird thinking about the life I could have had. When I auditioned, I went into wardrobe and they gave me a pair of shoes to wear that had Harold written on them&quot;. Moon was eventually given a role with the soap twenty years later.

==Development==
===Characterisation===
In his fictional backstory, Harold was a stock and station agent, who married a woman called Mavis. The couple had two children, David (Kevin Harrington) and Kerry (Linda Hartley-Clark). After Mavis&#x27;s death, Harold was left to cope with his teenage children alone. He had a close relationship with David, but Kerry rebelled against Harold&#x27;s conservative ways and she left to travel the world. David later moved to Adelaide.

Harold is described as being &quot;indecisive, considerate, stuffy and reserved.&quot; Harold is a Christian and never misses church on Sunday, he was also once an &quot;enthusiastic&quot; Scout leader. Due to his ways, Harold would not live with Madge Ramsay (Anne Charleston) until they were married. Virgin Media said Harold is &quot;prim and proper&quot; and &quot;an old-fashioned fuddy-duddy.&quot; They also state he is the complete opposite of Madge and add he is &quot;famed for his vegetarian ways, tee-total habits and fastidiousness and moralising&quot; Harold&#x27;s hobbies include playing the tuba, giving his time to the Salvation Army and birdwatching. Smith hated playing the tuba and wished the producers would have given Harold a mouth organ instead. He said &quot;I think they thought, &#x27;Here&#x27;s a big fat actor, let&#x27;s give him a big fat instrument. That&#x27;ll be funny!&#x27;.&quot; Harold also briefly has a comedic alter ego named &quot;Afro Harold.&quot; Smith told &quot;Inside Soap&quot; in 1999 that Harold&#x27;s &quot;pessimism and pontificating&quot; really got to him, but he agreed with Harold&#x27;s moral outlook on life.

In 2003, Harold had a stroke and his personality changed. He left the Salvation Army, became a &quot;peeping tom&quot;, started drinking alcohol and he pinched Izzy Hoyland&#x27;s (Natalie Bassingthwaighte) bottom. Smith researched strokes and how they affect a person&#x27;s psyche after becoming concerned that Harold&#x27;s behaviour would stretch his character&#x27;s credibility too much. Harold later recovered and returned to his previous ways. Network Ten dubbed Harold the &quot;undisputed patriarch of Erinsborough&quot; and the heart and soul of the community.

===Friendship with Lou Carpenter===
Lou Carpenter (Tom Oliver) was initially Harold&#x27;s &quot;nemesis&quot; and rival for Madge&#x27;s affections. They had both fallen for Madge while they were all at school together. Lou arrives in Ramsay Street to steal Madge from Harold before she marries him, but he cannot stop the wedding and he leaves. Lou later returns and becomes friends with Harold. Oliver said that some reviewers had likened Lou and Harold&#x27;s relationship to Laurel and Hardy and &quot;The Odd Couple&quot;. The &quot;Courier-Mail&quot; said Harold and Lou&#x27;s friendship was one of their favourite &quot;bromances&quot; on television. They said their most bromantic moment was &quot;When Harold returned to Erinsborough, after being feared drowned for many years, he had no memory of his old life. But when Lou served him jelly one night Harold suddenly remembered how Lou used to tease him at school by calling him &quot;Jelly Belly&quot; and, presto, his memory was restored.&quot; Harold is imprisoned after a case of mistaken identity and Lou raises the money for his bail.

Harold later donates a kidney to Lou and they go into business together, founding the General Store. Harold and Lou both fall for Rosie Hoyland (Maggie Millar), which leads to some arguments and Harold destroying a love letter from Lou to Rosie. When Gino Esposito (Shane McNamara) moves in with Harold, the writers decided to tweak the &quot;standard love triangle story&quot; with Lou becoming jealous of the Gino and Harold&#x27;s friendship. Harold and Gino get along very well and share a love of Broadway musical DVDs. Of this, Peter Mattessi of &quot;The Age&quot; said &quot;The tension this created between Lou and Harold (&quot;same-sex platonic life-partners&quot;, according to Toadie) was a wonderful storytelling twist, and the innuendo made Gino&#x27;s sexuality clear to those in the know, yet avoided the questions from younger viewers which would jeopardise the G rating.&quot; After Smith announced his departure in 2008, Oliver was asked if Lou would be sad about his best friend&#x27;s exit and he said &quot;Oh yes, definitely, but the old rascals keep in touch all the time. It was a sad farewell. Not just in character, but for me and Ian [Smith] too&quot;.

===Departure (1991)===
Smith was written out in 1991. He told &quot;Inside Soap&quot;&#x27;s Mary Fletcher: &quot;I would love the luxury of saying it was my decision to leave, but it wasn&#x27;t.&quot; His departure occurred amidst a ratings decline. Network Ten&#x27;s executive John Holmes took control of a cast revamp; he introduced new characters and helped to write out Harold and seven other characters. Holmes believed the show had become &quot;tired&quot; and that introducing more &quot;young and spunky&quot; characters would improve the show&#x27;s future. Smith later explained that he was offered a new contract with a significant cut in salary, but he was not prepared to accept it. When he returned from a short holiday, he learned that Harold would be washed off a rock and presumed dead. Smith told Fletcher that he had been &quot;pretty restless&quot; for over a year, so he was not shocked by the development, and instead saw it as an opportunity to pursue other work. Harold&#x27;s exit storyline saw him swept out to sea while he and Madge are visiting the coast. One minute he is standing on a rock, looking out over the sea, and the next he is gone. The character&#x27;s exit was left &quot;deliberately ambiguous&quot;, so Smith could return to the show if he wanted to. Smith said &quot;Harold&#x27;s body may have been washed out to sea long ago. On the other hand, he may be living happily under a false name somewhere else in Australia. Only time will tell.&quot;

===Reintroduction (1996)===
Smith returned to the role in 1996. He was initially asked to reprise the role for a three-month guest appearance. When the character&#x27;s return proved popular with viewers, Smith was invited to re-join the regular cast along with Charleston. Smith admitted that he had a feeling he and Charleston would be asked back, explaining &quot;The producers were already talking about new storylines for Harold and Madge – and they don&#x27;t waste time with things like that unless there&#x27;s a reason behind it!&quot; Harold initially returns to Erinsborough alone to audition to become a tuba player in the Salvation Army band, but it soon becomes apparent that there is another reason for his return. Smith said &quot;he feels that Madge has to get away from Brisbane, where they&#x27;re living at the moment. The reason why is a really human one, and one I think most of the viewers will agree with.&quot;

Harold became the second longest-running character in the show&#x27;s history. Smith decided to go part-time on the show in 2007. He had been ready to depart &quot;Neighbours&quot; for good, but the producers did not want him to leave. They then offered him a compromise, which would see Smith film for six weeks and then have a four-month break. Smith said that he was &quot;awfully glad&quot; that the producers talked him into coming back and explained, &quot;I&#x27;m not retiring, but I am walking away from having to work 13-hour days, day after day.&quot; Smith began appearing intermittently during 2008 and this forced the writers to take Harold in a new direction. Harold&#x27;s first departure saw him leave Ramsay Street for a tour around Australia.

===Prostate cancer and departure (2008–09)===
In August 2008, it was announced that Smith had quit &quot;Neighbours&quot;. Paula Lucarelli of Network Ten said &quot;When the discussions were made about his decision to go part-time last year, he said it was only going to be for a short time and then he would let us know. Production was aware that it would be coming.&quot; Smith began filming his final scenes in October of that year for a departure in February 2009. Smith revealed that he quit &quot;Neighbours&quot;, so he could travel more and because he was getting &quot;ongoing abuse&quot; from local people.

Chris Irvine from &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Harold would leave Erinsborough after winning a fight with prostate cancer. After Harold returned from a road trip, he accompanied Lou to see Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher). Karl suggested Harold should have a check-up and Harold was later diagnosed with prostate cancer, which needed immediate medical attention. Due to Harold&#x27;s Christian beliefs and the loss of Madge to cancer, he believed that the diagnosis was &quot;fate trying to reunite them&quot; and he refused treatment. Fletcher said &quot;Harold obviously has a lot of things to think about. He had to weigh up his belief that he&#x27;ll be reunited with Madge against the love he feels for his friends and family who are still alive. It&#x27;s a very difficult situation to be in.&quot; Harold shut everyone out of his life as he tried to cope with the news. After speaking to neighbour and fellow cancer sufferer, Stephanie Scully (Carla Bonner), Harold eventually agreed to have surgery and underwent chemotherapy treatment.

While cheering up Donna Freedman (Margot Robbie) at the General Store, Harold had a heart attack, which left him fighting for his life. His friends and neighbours held a 24-hour vigil at the hospital hoping he would pull through. Harold later flat-lined and Karl, despite knowing it could get him into trouble with the hospital authorities, went against Harold&#x27;s wish to not be resuscitated. Fletcher commented &quot;Harold&#x27;s heart stops beating, so Karl chooses to override his wishes and bring him back to life. As he fears, Harold is furious with him when he regains consciousness, insisting that he wanted to be reunited with his beloved wife, Madge, who died of cancer. Because of Karl&#x27;s actions, Harold feels as though Madge has been taken away from him twice.&quot; Harold forgave Karl for saving him, but made it clear that he no longer wanted to live. Harold eventually recovered and he decided to leave Erinsborough to go and live with his granddaughter. Smith&#x27;s final scenes as Harold were broadcast on 27 February 2009 in Australia. During an interview with &quot;Digital Spy&quot;, executive producer Susan Bower said she regretted choosing not to kill Harold during the cancer storyline due to the attention his impending exit had garnered, but she remained pleased that the character was still alive. She added &quot;we&#x27;ve got a lovely photograph of him in the store and we named the store after Harold, at least means that his spirit will always live on.&quot;

===Guest returns (2011–2023)===

In December 2010, cast member Ryan Moloney revealed to &quot;TV Week&quot; that Smith would be returning to &quot;Neighbours&quot; in 2011. Moloney said Smith would appear &quot;for a little bit&quot; and it was later reported by the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; that Smith would return for six weeks. Smith began filming his comeback scenes in February 2011. He told Holy Soap that he was surprised when he was asked to return to &quot;Neighbours&quot; and after talking with his wife, they agreed that he should go back for a brief stint. Smith later revealed that he was returning to work because he had suffered during the recession and wanted to earn some money. He also said that the chance to play Harold again was &quot;appealing&quot; and that he did not get a chance to say a proper goodbye to him. Smith vowed that it would be his last return to the show, as he and his wife have plans to travel through central Australia.

Harold returned on 9 May 2011. His return storyline saw him come back to Ramsay Street to help a friend. Smith said that viewers will think they know who it is, but they would be wrong. Smith said &quot;And of course there&#x27;s human pathos, there&#x27;s laughs – lots of laughs – [and] a little bit of romance, but I&#x27;m not saying who for, because I don&#x27;t think she/he would like me to let it out. Look, there&#x27;s a little bit of everything, but the thing is it&#x27;s all a happy ending and it couldn&#x27;t be better, and I loved it.&quot; Smith pitched one idea for Harold&#x27;s return and he said that it would be interesting to revisit the character once more. A few months later it was revealed that Harold comes back to Erinsborough after receiving a call for help from Toadfish Rebecchi. Not all of Harold&#x27;s help is &quot;received as graciously as it&#x27;s given&quot; and Harold&#x27;s new relationship with Carolyn Johnstone (Paula Duncan) was not welcomed by some of the neighbours. Smith told Sarah from &quot;Inside Soap&quot; that when the producers asked him if there was a particular storyline he would like to play, he suggested that Harold should get married and so he returns engaged. Harold&#x27;s news was not well received by his best friend Lou.

On 16 November 2014, it was announced that Smith had reprised his role for &quot;Neighbours&quot;&#x27; 30th anniversary in 2015. It was also confirmed that Harold would be reunited with his deceased wife Madge, who was thought to appear as a ghost. Smith initially had some doubts about returning to &quot;Neighbours&quot; again, as he was unsure if he remembered what to do. He said &quot;I worried about remembering the words for starters, and the first scene I remembered the words but I forgot to act. But it&#x27;s like falling off the horse. The old horse remembered me and I remembered it and we were fine.&quot; Smith also said he was sceptical about the storyline with Madge, believing that it would be &quot;one of those American arising from the dead&quot; plots, but after it was explained to him, he thought it had been &quot;cleverly handled&quot; and revealed that it had been dreamt up by Jackie Woodburne (Susan Kennedy).

Harold made his on-screen return during the episode broadcast on 17 February 2015. Harold was reunited with his old friends, Toadie and Lou. When Toadie notices that Harold is quick to change the subject whenever Carolyn is brought up and that he is carrying around a picture of Madge in his wallet, Toadie suspects Harold is hiding something. After calling Carolyn, Toadie learns that she and Harold have broken up. Harold admits that he and Carolyn were not quite the soul mates he has thought they were. He also tells Lou that he was embarrassed as his life was not perfect. Harold gives Madge&#x27;s grandson Daniel (Tim Phillipps) advice about his future wedding to Amber Turner (Jenna Rosenow), as he wants Daniel to have realistic expectations about marriage.

In February 2022, Laura-Jayne Tyler of &quot;Inside Soap&quot; reported that Smith would be reprising his role to play a part in the show&#x27;s finale, and that he had already started filming. A week later, Smith&#x27;s co-star Alan Fletcher confirmed Harold&#x27;s return, as he spoke about show&#x27;s final episodes on &quot;This Morning&quot;. On 7 May, Smith spoke about reprising his role for the final episodes airing later that year, saying: &quot;It&#x27;s an absolute pleasure to be back. I&#x27;m the biggest sook under the sun. I&#x27;m going to be shocking on the last night that &quot;Neighbours&quot; airs. It really will be an end of an era and I am so proud to have been a part of it.&quot; Harold returned on 18 July in Australia and on 6 July in the UK. He makes a &quot;surprise arrival&quot; in Erinsborough, where he befriends Zara Selwyn (Freya Van Dyke) who shares his concerns about her mother Amy Greenwood (Jacinta Stapleton), and Toadie and Melanie Pearson&#x27;s (Lucinda Cowden) engagement. Harold also helps counsel a grieving Mackenzie Hargreaves (Georgie Stone) by opening up about his own experiences with grief.

In February 2023, &quot;Variety&quot; announced Smith&#x27;s return to the series in a guest capacity. He appeared in a guest stint for nine episodes in the first month of the show&#x27;s reboot. His return plot centred to Harold experiencing memory loss. Alan Fletcher who plays Karl Kennedy, told Digital Spy that Harold is &quot;exhibiting behaviour that is medically concerning&quot;, and that it is &quot;a lot more complex than at first we think it is&quot;. Later on, local doctor Remi Varga-Murphy (Naomi Rukavina) identifies that his medication is causing his memory loss. Harold departs the series again on 10 October 2023.

===Permanent return (2024–2025)===
On 8 April 2024, it was announced that Smith would return to the series on a permanent basis. Joe Anderton of &quot;Digital Spy&quot; expressed surprise at the announcement, as Smith had stated his desire to retire the previous year. Smith later clarified that he had agreed to work on the series one day per week. Harold&#x27;s return aired on 28 May of that year. On-screen, Harold returns to Erinsborough to live at the Eirini Rising retirement complex. Smith ascribed Harold&#x27;s move to sentimentality, noting that he feels closer to Madge when in Erinsborough.

On 2 December 2024, Smith announced that he had recently been diagnosed with a rare and aggressive form of terminal lung cancer, and that as a consequence he had left the role of Harold. Smith stated that doctors labelled his cancer as &quot;non-fixable&quot; and that they &quot;expect him to die&quot;. Smith spoke to &quot;10 News First&quot; about his diagnosis and final day on set. Executive producer Jason Herbison confirmed that Harold would have a &quot;proper send-off&quot;, and it was also revealed that Charleston had returned to the series in a new role as part of Harold&#x27;s departure.

==Storylines==
===1987–1991===
Madge&#x27;s daughter, Charlene (Kylie Minogue), calls Harold and invites him to Erinsborough to see Madge. Harold surprises Madge when he arrives on her doorstep and he is keen to rekindle their romance. Harold decides to settle in the area and he opens a health food shop and moves in with Nell Mangel (Vivean Gray), who secretly admires Harold, as he is a churchgoer like she is. Harold proposes to Madge, but he calls off the wedding when Charlene wants to move in with Scott Robinson (Jason Donovan) out of wedlock, and Madge throws her ring in Lassiter&#x27;s Lake.

Five years later, it is revealed that Harold was swept out to sea and picked up by a trawler. He has amnesia and calls himself Ted. He works for the Salvation Army after they helped him start a new life. Harold turns up in Ramsay Street to collect some boxes from Marlene Kratz (Moya O&#x27;Sullivan). As Harold leaves, he bumps into Helen Daniels (Anne Haddy) who is shocked to see him. She tries to track him down and leaves her number for Harold at the Salvation Army shop. Harold calls Helen and comes to see her, but he becomes frustrated as he does not remember the things she tells him and leaves. Helen calls Madge, who had moved away, to tell her that Harold is alive and Madge flies to Erinsborough.

Marlene invites Harold to join her for lunch at the Coffee Shop, where Helen, Lou and Madge are waiting. Harold recognises Madge, but he has no idea that she is his wife until she tells him everything. Harold starts counselling and his memory returns. Harold and Madge renew their wedding vows and they move to Queensland. Harold returns to Erinsborough to play the tuba in a Salvation Army concert and he rents his old house. He and Madge eventually move back and they buy the Coffee Shop. Harold befriends Paul McClain (Jansen Spencer) and he and Madge foster him. They later foster Paul&#x27;s friend, Tad Reeves (Jonathon Dutton) too. Harold and Madge decide to take over the running of Grease Monkeys, but they later sell the business.

Sky returns to see Harold and he is shocked to find that she is now a rebellious teenager with black and blue hair. Harold offers to tell her more about Kerry and he introduces her to Boyd Hoyland (Kyal Marsh). David, his wife, Liljana (Marcella Russo) and their daughter, Serena (Lara Sacher) also come to town. Harold is unhappy at David&#x27;s behaviour, the way Liljana takes over his kitchen and how Serena is spoilt. Harold and David make up and Harold invites him to move in with him and Sky. Harold has a stroke and his personality changes. Harold becomes rude and selfish, he starts eating meat and drinking and he leaves the Salvation Army. Harold later recovers and goes back to normal. A fire sweeps through the Lassiter&#x27;s Complex and burns the Coffee Shop to the ground. He sets up a temporary Coffee Shop at the Community Hall with Paul Robinson&#x27;s (Stefan Dennis) help. Harold goes into business with Lou and they open the General Store. Joe returns and stays with Harold.

Sky, David, Liljana and Serena are involved in a plane crash. Sky is found and days later David&#x27;s body is recovered. Liljana and Serena are never found. Harold goes into denial and punches Joe, Sky tells him that she needs him and he snaps out of it. Harold blames Paul Robinson for David, Liljana and Serena&#x27;s deaths and he strangles Paul from behind. Paul survives and Harold later confesses to Paul, who does not press charges. Harold leaves town for a little while and on his return, he discovers that Sky is pregnant. Harold has a brief romance with Loris Timmins (Kate Fitzpatrick) and Sky gives birth to a daughter, Kerry (Claudine Henningsen). Sky moves away to be with Kerry&#x27;s father and Harold throws himself into work at the General Store. He later decides to pack up and travel around the country. Harold meets Kate Newton (Briony Behets) and they briefly stop over in Erinsborough, before leaving together.

Harold returns for Christmas and goes for a checkup. He is shocked when Karl tells him that he has prostate cancer and needs urgent treatment. Harold does not take the news well, but Karl eventually convinces him to fight. Harold has an operation and begins chemotherapy after speaking to Stephanie Scully. Harold later has a heart attack and Karl ignores his wishes not to be resuscitated. Harold&#x27;s cancer goes into remission and he decides to go and be with Sky. He gives his home to the Salvation Army and says goodbye to Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) when she sees him taking photos of Ramsay Street. The next day he says goodbye to everyone else and drives out of town. When he stops for tea, he discovers that Lou has been hiding in his camper van and they continue the journey together.

Two years later, Harold returns to Ramsay Street after receiving a call for help from Toadie, who is dealing with the news that his girlfriend Sonya Mitchell (Eve Morey) is the mother of his adopted son, Callum (Morgan Baker). Harold advises Toadie to be more forgiving and speak with Sonya. Harold meets Troy Miller (Dieter Brummer), but fails to pass his number onto Toadie as he thinks he has enough to deal with. After taking some secret calls, Harold tells Toadie that he is engaged to Carolyn Johnstone, a businesswoman. Harold witnesses a kiss between Sonya and Troy. Carolyn arrives and she and Harold confront Troy together. She also suggests that she and Harold get married in Erinsborough. Lou returns to town and is reunited with Harold. Lou does not get along with Carolyn and thinks she is stuck up. After they argue about Harold&#x27;s bucks night, Harold gets Lou and Carolyn to compromise on a joint party at Charlie&#x27;s. Troy physically threatens Harold, who tells Toadie.

On his wedding day, Harold visits Madge&#x27;s grave to get her blessing. He and Carolyn then get married. Harold and Carolyn later return for their honeymoon and tell Lou that he has taken on too much at the car yard and that he needs to slow down. Lou does not listen to them and he later collapses. Harold tells Lou to start taking his health seriously and Lou announces his intentions to sell the car yard. Shortly before they leave, Callum asks Harold and Carolyn for their help in getting Sonya to move back in. Harold talks to Toadie, who thinks it might be too soon. After saying their goodbyes to Lou, Harold and Carolyn are informed that Toadie and Sonya are moving back in together. Toadie thanks Harold and he and Carolyn leave.

Harold returns to Ramsay Street for Daniel Robinson&#x27;s wedding and the Erinsborough Festival. Harold catches up with Toadie and Lou. He tells them Carolyn could not accompany him as she is working, but then changes the subject when she is brought up again. Harold later makes a phone call to Carolyn and tells her he will send on her things. Harold asks Toadie to help him change his will and after Toadie calls Carolyn, he learns that she and Harold have split up. Harold tells Toadie that he and Carolyn drifted apart after realising that they were not soulmates after all. Harold befriends Sheila Canning (Colette Mann), who flirts with him. Harold begins thinking about Madge and starts to hear her voice. He becomes distracted while driving and crashes through the Erinsborough Festival. When he wakes, he sees Madge sitting beside him. She appears to him again and they converse about all the events Madge has missed and Daniel&#x27;s wedding.

Madge disapproves of Daniel&#x27;s fiancée and believes he is better suited to Imogen Willis (Ariel Kaplan). Harold then tells Daniel that marrying Amber would be a mistake and Daniel bans him from coming to the wedding. Madge encourages Harold to go on a date with Sheila and they bond over their families. But Harold later tells Madge that she is the only one for him. Harold tells Susan about Madge and she advises him to live in the present. Sky asks Harold to give up his nomadic lifestyle and move to Port Douglas to help out with her children. He agrees after Sky mentions Madge came to her in a dream, believing it to be a good idea. Harold takes a last look at Number 24 with Madge, who tells him she will not be coming with him. He leaves after saying goodbye to his friends.

===2022–present===
Seven years later, Harold makes a surprise visit to the Kennedys, where he meets Mackenzie Hargreaves and expresses his sorrow for the loss of her husband, Hendrix Greyson (Ben Turland). Karl and Susan invite Harold to stay with them, before he visits the café and meets Jane Harris (Annie Jones) and her children Nicolette Stone (Charlotte Chimes) and Byron Stone (Joe Klocek). Harold visits Toadie&#x27;s house and enters just as Zara Selwyn is questioning her mother Amy Greenwood about whether she has feelings for Toadie. Karl and Susan soon turn up and Toadie returns to announce that he and Melanie Pearson are engaged. Zara notices Harold does not look happy with the news and he admits that he has concerns. Zara is convinced that Toadie and Amy would make a better couple, and tells Harold that if he really cares about Toadie, he will help her break Toadie and Melanie up. Harold asks Amy&#x27;s opinion of Melanie and her relationship with Toadie&#x27;s children, but she assures him that Melanie is great with them. 

Harold admits to Mackenzie that in addition to seeing Karl, Susan and Toadie, he came to Erinsborough for her. He talks to her about keeping hold of the memories she has of Hendrix and tells her about the visions he had of Madge. He encourages her to talk to Hendrix and reckons he and Madge would get on well. Zara later tells Harold about Melanie&#x27;s issues with Sonya&#x27;s presence around the house and her initial rejection of Toadie&#x27;s proposal. When Harold says that he will not act as a matchmaker for Amy and Toadie, Zara asks whether he can stand back and do nothing. Melanie asks Harold if he is avoiding her and then asks him to make a toast at her wedding, but he makes an excuse not to. He tells Melanie that he has his reservations about the wedding and is worried about Toadie&#x27;s children, as she hurt his grandchildren deeply when she left Joe. Harold privately tells Melanie that he is worried that she will treat Toadie&#x27;s children the same as Joe&#x27;s children and Melanie spends the engagement party staying away from him, before she tells Toadie what he said. Harold is then kicked out of the party. Harold calls Joe and he admits that he stretched the truth at the time and that his kids missed Melanie once she left. Harold explains to Toadie and Melanie, and the three make up. Harold also admits that he knew that Amy liked Toadie once the truth about her crush is revealed. Harold is left devastated when the Ramsay Street history book is destroyed, but is surprised when Levi Canning (Richie Morris) and Freya Wozniak (Phoebe Roberts) offer him the first entry in the new history book they have made. Harold goes to Toadie and Melanie&#x27;s wedding and their reception on Ramsay Street, where he sees Scott and Charlene have returned, and Harold parties with the street&#x27;s residents.

Two years later, Harold is once again visiting Ramsay Street for Toadie&#x27;s wedding to Terese Willis (Rebekah Elmaloglou), and staying with Karl and Susan. He begins to experience lapses in memory and moments of confusion, leading Karl to fear he is suffering from dementia. However, it is eventually discovered that his symptoms are being caused by a change in his medication. Harold departs to take a rail trip with Karl. The following year, Terese establishes the Eirini Rising retirement complex in Erinsborough, and Harold decides to purchase a unit and return to the area. He befriends young staff member and high school student JJ Varga-Murphy (Riley Brant). After several incidents occur within the Eirini Rising complex, including his very own tuba being stolen, Harold&#x27;s granddaughter, Sky, flies down from Port Douglas wanting to take Harold back up north where he is safe. However, Harold refuses to do so as he simply wishes to remain in Erinsborough, given the connections he has with the community. Harold is then voted by the Eirini Rising residents as president, despite not campaigning for the election. Terese and Susan reveal to him that he is a popular, well-respected person amongst the residents. Harold expresses to Toadie his disappointment of him after his separation from Terese, which upsets him. They eventually meet up and Harold apologizes for being so harsh. He later attends Toadie&#x27;s farewells party on Ramsay Street.

==Reception==
Smith has earned various award nominations for his role as Harold. At the 2007 &quot;Inside Soap&quot; Awards, he was nominated for &quot;Funniest Performance&quot;. The following year saw Smith nominated for &quot;Funniest Performance&quot; again and &quot;Best Actor&quot;. In 2009, Smith was once again nominated for &quot;Funniest Performance&quot; and &quot;Best Storyline&quot; for Harold&#x27;s cancer. That same year he was nominated for the &quot;Most Popular Personality&quot; and &quot;Most Popular Actor&quot; Logie Awards.

Television critic Charlie Brooker praised the character of Harold in 2005, saying &quot;Thank God then, for Harold Bishop, who looks precisely the same as he always did – just slightly more so. His is probably the friendliest face on television – a cross between 10 Toytown mayors and a baby&quot;. Virgin Media included Harold in their top ten favourite soap characters poll in 2007. They also express that he&#x27;s become &quot;one of the most popular Ramsey Street residents.&quot; After listing his many storylines, Paul Kalina of &quot;The Age&quot; asked whether there were any plot devices left for the writers to give Harold. He went on to say that Harold&#x27;s 2008 exit was &quot;a criminally low-key send-off for &quot;Neighbours&quot;&#x27; most colourful and longest-standing cast member. For the best part of two decades, Harold was the moral compass of Ramsay Street, a paragon of the decent-in-a-sliced-white-bread-kind-of-way and nostalgic ideals that distinguishes the squeaky clean &quot;Neighbours&quot; from a legion of more temperate television soaps.&quot; Kalina added that the writers had &quot;better be working up something damned good for when Harold returns.&quot; Tony Squires from &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; branded Harold a &quot;classically over-the-top character&quot;. Ethan Sills of &quot;The Spin Off&quot; called Harold &quot;the show&#x27;s God-fearing, tuba-playing version of Alf Stewart&quot;.

Ruth Deller of entertainment website Lowculture expressed her sadness over Harold&#x27;s cancer storyline saying, &quot;Poor Jellybelly. There might have been a little bit of tear-shedding this week at his cancer diagnosis and trip to Madge&#x27;s grave. We love you Hazza! The current web campaigns to get Ian Smith a golden logie after 20 years on &quot;Neighbours&quot; also have our support, in a very nominal kind of way.&quot; Of his 2009 departure, Deller said &quot;Actor Ian Smith is retiring, which is the kind of behaviour we expect from normal people, not soap stars. He and his wife are going to be &#x27;grey nomads&#x27; – the term for Australians who spend their retirement travelling the country in trailer homes. And in a case of art imitating life, that&#x27;s exactly what Hazza will be doing. [..] To be fair, although I&#x27;m sad to see old Jelly Belly depart, it&#x27;s a nice way to go: much better than him having a second screen death, or moving to live with the whiny Sky. Considering that Harold has had one of the most tragic lives of any Ramsay Street resident (two dead wives, two dead children, a dead grandchild, a dead daughter in law, being missing presumed dead for several years, watching Sky turn from fierce funky teen to moaning nymphomaniac, becoming insane and murderous, being conned by a variety of unscrupulous women and so on), giving him a happy ending is even sweeter.&quot; Sarah Megginson of SheKnows placed Harold&#x27;s departure on her &quot;8 Most Memorable &quot;Neighbours&quot; Moments&quot;.

In 2010, to celebrate &quot;Neighbours&quot;&#x27; 25th anniversary, British Sky Broadcasting profiled twenty-five characters of which they believed were the most memorable in the series&#x27; history. Harold was included in the list and they describe him as having no luck in life, they added &quot;Harold Bishop is proof that bad things happen to good people. Harold made Helen Daniels look like a manipulative harpy, and yet the universe still conspired to sweep him out to sea, give him amnesia for several years, and to give his wife Madge terminal cancer. This is all tear-jerking stuff, but the death of his son David&#x27;s family in a plane crash and Harold subsequently putting a brave face on the situation turned the end of three unloved characters into one of the soap&#x27;s saddest storylines in years.&quot; In April 2012, Harold was immortalised in wax for the Madame Tussauds attraction in Darling Harbour.

Harold was placed at number four on the &quot;Huffpost&#x27;s&quot; &quot;35 greatest Neighbours characters of all time&quot; feature. Journalist Adam Beresford described him &quot;a tuba-playing Salvation Army volunteer&quot; and a &quot;prim and proper [...] old-fashioned fusspot who became the heart and soul of Neighbours.&quot; They branded Harold&#x27;s marriage to Madge and friendship with Lou a &quot;classic partnerships&quot;. Beresford branded Harold&#x27;s return from the dead the &quot;best soap resurrection since Bobby Ewing&quot; from &quot;Dallas&quot;. He concluded that &quot;we still miss old Jelly Belly.&quot; In 2021, Harold was placed ninth in a poll ran via soap fansite &quot;Back To The Bay&quot;, which asked readers to determine the top ten most popular &quot;Neighbours&quot; characters. In 2022, Kate Randall from &quot;Heat&quot; included Harold and Madge in the magazine&#x27;s top ten &quot;Neighbours&quot; characters of all time feature. Randall profiled the duo stating &quot;love&#x27;s old dream, these two were everything we adored about Neighbours.&quot; She added that she was &quot;thankful&quot; he returned from the dead &quot;along with his tuba&quot;. In a feature profiling the &quot;top 12 iconic Neighbours characters&quot;, critic Sheena McGinley of the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; placed Harold and Madge as joint tenth place. Lorna White from &quot;Yours&quot; profiled the magazine&#x27;s &quot;favourite Neighbours characters of all time&quot; which featured Harold on the list. A reporter from &quot;The Scotsman&quot; included Harold&#x27;s return from the dead as one of the show&#x27;s top five moments in its entire history. Sam Strutt of &quot;The Guardian&quot; compiled a feature counting down the top ten most memorable moments from &quot;Neighbours&quot;. Strutt listed Harold&#x27;s disappearance at sea as the second most memorable. A &quot;Herald Sun&quot; reporter included Harold being widowed and his 2015 return in their &quot;Neighbours&#x27; 30 most memorable moments&quot; feature. They also included his 1991 lost at sea departure, of which they opined &quot;to this day, the most talked about exit on Neighbours.&quot;

<text>Craster is a small fishing village on the Northumberland coast of England, from Alnwick. The next village to the north is Embleton. It is within the Northumberland Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

==Geography==
The walk along the coast to the south passes by Cullernose Point, an example of the basaltic cliffs which are a significant feature of the local landscape, and are part of the Whin Sill. The walk along the rocky shore to the north along leads to the ruins of Dunstanburgh Castle.

==History==
The remains of a tower on the end of the harbour are all that can be seen now of the much taller building which was part of the overhead equipment which used to convey the local stone from where it was quarried to boats in the harbour. The disused quarry is now a car park.

A mile to the west, Dunstan Hall is a mansion incorporating a medieval pele tower, now used as holiday accommodation.

A small distance inland lies Craster Tower, the home of the Craster family who were the local lords of the manor. A memorial on the harbour wall commemorates Captain John Charles Pulleine Craster, who was killed in Tibet on 28 June 1904.

For many years, the village has had a herring-curing business: Craster kippers are well known around the world.

During the Second World War, the Heughs, north of Craster, were home to a Coastal Defence/Chain Home radar station.

<text>Cartmel Priory church serves as the parish church of Cartmel, Cumbria, England (formerly in Lancashire).

==Priory==

=== Foundation ===
The priory was founded in 1190 by William Marshal, created 1st Earl of Pembroke, intended for a community of the Augustinian Canons regular and was dedicated to Saint Mary the Virgin and Saint Michael.

To support the new house, William granted it the whole fief of the district of Cartmel. It was first colonised by a prior and twelve canons sent from Bradenstoke Priory in Wiltshire.

===14th century===
Between 1327 and 1347 a chapel with four traceried windows was provided by John Harington, 1st Baron Harington in the south choir aisle; his tomb, also containing his second wife, is in the building. The stonework on the tomb contains the Harrington coat of arms with the Harrington knot as well as the Dacre coat of arms with the scallop shells. The gatehouse, which apart from the church itself is the only surviving structure of the medieval priory, was built between 1330 and 1340.

===15th and 16th centuries===
In the 15th century extensive work was undertaken, in part due to damage (believed to be from subsidence) in the southern part of the complex. The original cloister was demolished and a new one built to the north of the priory church. In the east end of the church, the early lancet windows were replaced by one huge window of stained glass, misericords were installed in the choir, and the tower was extended. Unusually, the extension to the tower sits at a 45-degree angle to the base on which it rests, a feature believed to be unique in England. Work on the building continued intermittently into the 16th century, when the choir screen was constructed.

The 25 misericords date from 1440, and are of an exceptional quality. They include representation of the Green man, which with its three heads sprouting foliage is said to symbolize the devil.

==Dissolution==
The priory was surrendered by its then community of ten canons at the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536. An effect of the Pilgrimage of Grace was that the community was reinstated, one of perhaps 16 such cases. The prior, Richard Preston, had not thrown in his lot with resistance, but had fled to the Crown forces under Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby. He was to secure a parochial living to supplement his Crown pension. Others had a different fate. With the failure of the rising, as in other similar cases there came a brutal end for some, the subprior and several of the canons being hanged, along with ten villagers who had supported them.

The priory&#x27;s ancient responsibility for providing a Guide over Cartmel Sands was transferred to the Duchy of Lancaster. Thomas Hogeson was appointed by the Duchy as the first official guide to the sands on 29 January 1548.

==Parish Church==

The Dissolution commissioners had instructions to &quot;pull down to the ground all the walls of the churches, stepulls, cloysters, fraterys, dorters, chapter howsys&quot; and all the rest. The materials were then to be sold for the profit of the Crown. These habitual procedures would have meant Cartmel Priory&#x27;s church being demolished along with the rest of its buildings. However, in this case the founder William Marshal had given an altar within the church to the village, and provided a priest along with it. The villagers petitioned to be allowed to keep the church as it was their only place of worship, and this was granted.

===17th century===
Despite the villagers&#x27; being allowed to keep the church, the lead was stripped from the nave, and until 1618 when George Preston, a landowner at nearby Holker Hall, provided considerable finances to allow the roof to be reinstated, the villagers actually worshipped in the choir, rather than the nave of the church. In 1643 some Roundhead troops stayed in the village, stabling their horses in the church. Bullet holes from this time are still visible in the southwest door of the nave.

The nave was used after the Dissolution as a prison and later between 1624 and 1790 as a grammar school.

===19th and 20th centuries===
By 1830 the church was in need of repair again, and underwent a restoration, which has been described in the Edge Guide as &quot;more enthusiastic than sympathetic&quot;. In 1850 a new panelled ceiling was inserted in the central part of the church, forming the belfry floor.

A further restoration was carried out in 1867 by E. G. Paley. The restoration was described in the &quot;Westmorland Gazette&quot; of 28 September 1867 The old seats and galleries have been removed from the nave and transepts, which have been reseated with new benches of oak. The plaster and whitewash of succeeding centuries has been entirely taken off and cleaned from the walls, pillars, and arches of the church. The ancient massive open timbered roof of oak, which for centuries has been hid behind a plastered ceiling, has been uncovered and restored. The whole of the windows have been reglazed with Hartley’s cathedral glass. A new font, pulpit and reading-desk of stone have been added to the church. The font is square with moulded panels, carved and drapered work, and marble shaft. The pulpit is of octagonal design, supported by marble shafts, on three sides are moulded panels containing carved heads representing our Saviour, St. Peter, and St. Paul. A new organ has been erected in the town choir.

In 1923, the gatehouse became a museum, and was used for exhibitions, and meetings, before being presented in 1946 to the National Trust who continue to operate it as the &quot;Cartmel Priory Gatehouse&quot;.

The church is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Windermere, the archdeaconry of Westmorland and Furness, and the diocese of Carlisle. Its benefice is united with those of St Mary, Allithwiate, St Peter, Field Broughton, St John the Baptist, Flookburgh, St Paul, Grange-over-Sands, Grange Fell Church, Grange-Over-Sands, and St Paul, Lindale, to form the benefice of Cartmel Peninsula. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building.

===Organ===
The pipe organ was installed in 1867 by F. Jardine of Manchester. The inauguration was recorded in the &quot;Westmorland Gazette&quot; of 28 September 1867: The organ which has been built by Mr. Jardine of Manchester, had its capabilities tested by Mr. Stevens of Holy Trinity Church, Manchester. It had been intended where the rubric leaves it optional, whether any part shall be “said or sung” to have our beautiful church service sung by one of the finest choirs of Manchester, and the organ presided at by one of the most accomplished amateur players in the North of England. Arrangements having been made by Mr. Jardine for the attendance of Mr. Joule and his choir of St. Peter’s; but the Bishop has so strong an objection to musical services, and such strong fears of its effects on worshippers, that out of deference to his opinion the people of Cartmel were deprived of what would certainly have been, and what they had long been anticipating as a good treat. 

The organ was rebuilt in 1969 by Rushworth and Dreaper of Liverpool and in 2005 by Principal Pipe Organs. A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

===Bells===
The church tower contains a ring of 6 bells. Four are new, dating from 1987 by Eijsbouts, with an old set of 4 bells (2 from 1661 and then 1726 and 1729) making an old 6 when combined with the 2 smaller bells of 1932 by John Taylor and Co.

<text>Malmesbury Abbey, at Malmesbury in Wiltshire, England, is a former Benedictine abbey dedicated to Saint Peter and Saint Paul. It was one of the few English religious houses with a continuous history from the 7th century through to the Dissolution of the Monasteries.

==Monastic history==
In the later seventh century, the site of the Abbey was chosen by Máel Dub, an Irish monk who established a hermitage, teaching local children. Towards the end of his life, in the late seventh century, the area was conquered by the Saxons. Malmesbury Abbey was founded as a Benedictine monastery around 676 by the scholar-poet Aldhelm, a nephew of King Ine of Wessex. The town of Malmesbury grew up around the expanding Abbey and under Alfred the Great was made a burh, with an assessment of 12 hides.

In October 939 Æthelstan, king of Wessex and of the English, died in Gloucester, and in the year 941 his remains were buried in the Abbey. The choice of Malmesbury over the New Minster in Winchester indicated that the king remained an outsider to the West Saxon court. A mint was founded at the Abbey around this time.

The Abbey developed an illustrious reputation for academic learning under the rule of abbots such as Aldhelm, John Scotus Eriugena, Alfred of Malmesbury and Aelfric of Eynsham.

The Abbey was the site of an early attempt at human flight when, during the early 11th century, the monk Eilmer of Malmesbury attached wings to his body and flew from a tower. Eilmer flew over 200 yards (200 m) before landing, breaking both legs. He later remarked that the only reason he did not fly further was the lack of a tail on his glider.

The Domesday Book of 1086 says of the Abbey: 
:&quot;In Wiltshire: Highway (11 hides), Dauntsey (10 hides), Somerford Keynes (5 hides), Brinkworth (5 hides), Norton, near Malmesbury (5 hides), Brokenborough with Corston (50 hides), Kemble (30 hides—now in Glos.), Long Newnton (30 hides), Charlton (20 hides), Garsdon (3 hides), Crudwell (40 hides), Bremhill (38 hides), Purton (35 hides); (fn. 127) in Gloucestershire: Littleton - upon - Severn (5 hides); (fn. 128) and in Warwickshire: Newbold Pacey (3 hides)&quot;. These lands were valued at £188 14s. in all and were assessed as 3 knights&#x27; fees.

The 12th-century historian William of Malmesbury was a monk at the Abbey.

===Construction and structural collapse===
The current Abbey was substantially completed by 1180. The 431 feet (131 m) tall spire, and the tower it was built upon, collapsed in a storm around 1500 destroying much of the church, including two-thirds of the nave and the transept.

===Abbots===
==Parish church==

The abbey, which owned in the twenty parishes that constituted the Malmesbury Hundred, was closed at the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539 by Henry VIII and was sold, with all its lands, to William Stumpe, a rich merchant. He returned the abbey church to the town for continuing use as a parish church, and filled the abbey buildings with up to 20 looms for his cloth-weaving enterprise.

The west tower fell around 1550, demolishing the three westernmost bays of the nave. As a result of these two collapses, less than half of the original building stands today. During the English Civil War, Malmesbury suffered extensive damage evidenced by hundreds of pock-marks left by bullets and shot which can still be seen on the south, west and east sides of the building.

In 1949, the church was designated as a Grade I listed building. Historic England added it to their Heritage at Risk Register in 2022, stating that the roofs of the nave and aisles were leaking and in need of repair.

Today Malmesbury Abbey is in full use as the parish church of Malmesbury, in the Diocese of Bristol. The remains still contain a fine parvise (a room over the porch) which holds some examples of books from the abbey library. The Anglo-Saxon charters of Malmesbury, though extended by forgeries and improvements executed in the abbey&#x27;s scriptorium, provide source material today for the history of Wessex and the West Saxon church from the seventh century.

===Vicars of St Paul&#x27;s and the Abbey Church, Malmesbury===
From 1301 until the mid-16th century, the parish church of Malmesbury was St. Paul&#x27;s. This stood in what is now Birdcage Walk (its tower and steeple remains, and is now the Abbey belltower). In 1539 Malmesbury Abbey ceased to exist as a monastic community and in August 1541 Thomas Cranmer licensed the abbey church to replace St Paul&#x27;s as the parish church of Malmesbury. In 1837 the ancient chapelries of Corston and Rodbourne were made into a separate parish, called St Paul Malmesbury Without, and St Mary Westport was united to the abbey church.
==Organ==
The earliest organ was obtained in 1846 and had formerly stood in the church of St Benet Fink, Threadneedle Street, London; it had been manufactured in 1714 by Abraham Jordan. In 1938 a new organ was provided by Henry Willis, which had formerly been owned by Sir George Alfred Wills, Baronet of Bristol. Eventually it too was replaced.

The current organ dates from 1984 and was built by E.J. Johnson of Cambridge at a cost of £71,000 (). A specification of the organ can be found on the National Pipe Organ Register.

==Notable burials==

*Máel Dub, who founded the first monastic community in Malmesbury and gave his name to the town. His bones were cast out of the church of St. Peter and St. Paul by the Norman abbot Warin of Lyre, and relegated to a far corner of St. Michael&#x27;s Church.
*Aldhelm, first Bishop of Sherborne and saint
* Æthelwine and Ælfwine, sons of Æthelweard (son of Alfred)
* Æthelstan, regarded as the first king of England. He was buried in the tower, under the altar of St. Mary. According to William of Malmesbury, Æthelstan&#x27;s body was disinterred in the 11th century and reburied in the abbot&#x27;s garden (now Abbey House Gardens) to avoid Norman desecration. He is commemorated by an empty 15th-century tomb in the north aisle.
* Daniel, Bishop of Winchester
*Hannah Twynnoy, supposedly the first person to be killed by a tiger in England, is buried in the churchyard, her gravestone inscribed with a poem. She was killed on 23 October 1703 after teasing a tiger in a menagerie stabled in the White Lion public house where she worked.
* Sir Roger Scruton, a writer and philosopher who lived near Malmesbury, was buried in the churchyard in 2020.

==Legacy==
In 2009, historian Michael Wood speculated that Malmesbury Abbey was the site of transcription of the Anglo-Saxon epic poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;.

<text>Pershore Abbey, at Pershore in Worcestershire, was a Benedictine abbey with Anglo-Saxon origins and is now an Anglican parish church, the Church of the Holy Cross.

==History==

===Foundation===
The foundation of the minster at Pershore is alluded to in a spurious charter of King Æthelred of Mercia (r. 675–704). It purports to be the charter by which Æthelred granted 300 hides (about 36,000 acres) at Gloucester to King Osric of the Hwicce, and another 300 at Pershore to Osric&#x27;s brother Oswald. It is preserved only as a copy in a 14th-century register of Gloucester, where it is followed by two charters listing the endowments made to the abbey until the reign of King Burgred (852-874). The 300 hides mentioned here are unlikely to be a contemporary detail, as they were intended to represent the triple hundred which later made up the area of Worcestershire. Historian H. P. R. Finberg suggests that the foundation charter may have been drafted in the 9th century, based on some authentic material. Oswald&#x27;s foundation of a monastery at Pershore is not stated explicitly in the charter, but the Worcester chronicle &quot;Cronica de Anglia&quot;, written &quot;c&quot;. 1150, reports it under the annal for 683, and John Leland, consulting the now lost &quot;Annals of Pershore&quot;, places the event around 689. Patrick Sims-Williams suggests that the foundation by Oswald may also represent an oral tradition at Pershore, as its archives were probably destroyed in fires of 1002 and again in 1223.

In the 9th century, Pershore comes to light again as a minster under the patronage of Mercian kings. In other charters contained in the Gloucester register, Coenwulf (r. 796–821) and Burgred are recorded as having been patrons of Pershore. A charter of King Edgar refers back to a grant of privileges by Coenwulf at the request of his ealdorman (&quot;dux&quot;) Beornnoth.

===Refoundation===
In the reign of King Edgar (959-975), Pershore reappears as one of the abbeys to be re-established (or restored) under the programme of Benedictine reform. Writing &quot;c&quot;. 1000, the Ramsey monk Byrhtferth relates that under the auspices of Oswald, bishop of Worcester, seven monasteries were founded in his diocese, notably including Pershore. The first abbot was one Foldbriht, whose name is sufficiently rare to suggest that he may be the same Foldbriht whom Bishop Æthelwold previously installed at Abingdon and used to be a monk of Glastonbury before that time.

The refoundation is what lies behind an exceptionally elaborate charter for Pershore, dated 972, in which King Edgar is presented as granting new lands and privileges as well as confirming old ones, such as the one granted by Coenwulf. The authenticity of this document, however, has been questioned. Simon Keynes in 1980 showed that it belongs to the so-called &quot;Orthodoxorum&quot; group of charters, so named after the initial word of their proem, which he concluded were forgeries based on a charter of Æthelred II&#x27;s reign. Since then, Susan Kelly and John Hudson have vindicated the status of some of these charters, including the one for Pershore, which is written in square minuscule characteristic of some of Edgar&#x27;s charters. More recently, Peter Stokes has brought to light a variant copy of the charter and suggests that two different versions may have been produced around the same time, somewhere between 972 and 1066. A possible scenario is that they were produced to make up for the loss of the original charter(s), perhaps shortly after the fire which is reported to have destroyed the abbey in &quot;c&quot;. 1002 (see below).

The 12th-century historian William of Malmesbury, who seems unaware of any pre-existing minster, claims that one Æthelweard (&quot;Egelwardus&quot;), whom he describes as &quot;ealdorman of Dorset&quot;, had founded the abbey of Pershore in the time of King Edgar. Similarly, Osbert&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; of Eadburh of Winchester alleges that one &quot;Alwardus&quot;, who is styled &quot;comes&quot; and &quot;consul&quot;, was responsible for the refoundation. Both authors also attribute to him a role in the translation of some of the saint&#x27;s relics to Pershore. Osbert writes that an abbess of Nunnaminster had sold some relics to Æthelweard (&quot;Alwardus&quot;), who in turn handed them over for the refoundation of Pershore. Some scholars have identified him with Æthelweard, the well-known chronicler and ealdorman of the western shires. 

Whatever high-level patronage the foundation may have received, it was not enough to sustain its fortunes for very long. Precisely what happened to Pershore in the later 10th century is poorly documented, but some sources seem to hint that it went into decline during the succession crisis which emerged in the wake of King Edgar&#x27;s death. William of Malmesbury says that &quot;it, too, like the others, decayed to a pitiful extent, and was reduced by more than a half&quot;. According to Leland, the &quot;Annals of Pershore&quot; hold an earl called &quot;Delfer&quot; responsible for depriving the abbey of several of its lands. This &quot;Delfer&quot; has been interpreted as a misreading for Ælfhere (d. 983), ealdorman of Mercia (whom Leland mentions elsewhere). While himself a patron of Ely and Abingdon, Ælfhere was also charged with despoiling reformed monasteries during Edward the Martyr&#x27;s brief reign (975-978). The targets included houses refounded by Bishop Oswald or Bishop Æthelwold and considerably enriched under the patronage of Æthelstan Half-King&#x27;s sons, notably Æthelwine, ealdorman of East Anglia. Evesham Abbey, for instance, as later reported by its own chronicle, also claimed to have lost several of its lands in this way, and Winchcombe was disbanded altogether. Æthelwine, in his turn, was remembered at Ely as a despoiler of its lands. Tensions between Ælfhere and Bishop Oswald, whose authorities overlapped, and between Ælfhere and Æthelwine, with whom Oswald maintained a close relationship, are therefore likely to have been the principal cause of the upheaval. Whether a liberty similar to that of Oswaldslow was an extra cause for concern, compromising Ælfhere&#x27;s authority as ealdorman, cannot be ascertained from the sources.

===&quot;Second&quot; refoundation===

Pershore suffered worse misfortune when, according to Leland, it was destroyed by fire and subsequently deserted by the monks, probably in the year 1002. The monastic archives were largely lost in the event, as no original record from before that date survives today. Pershore, however, found a generous patron in the wealthy nobleman Odda of Deerhurst (d. 1056), who restored many of its lands and granted new ones. It has been suggested that he was a kinsman of the ealdorman Æthelweard. The earliest extant record from the archive of Pershore, a charter of 1014 by which King Æthelred granted Mathon (Herefordshire) to ealdorman Leofwine, may testify to Odda&#x27;s restorations of lands to the house. The monastery was active again by the 1020s, as its abbot Brihtheah was promoted bishop of Worcester in 1033. Odda&#x27;s brother Ælfric was buried at Pershore in 1053, joined three years later by Odda himself.

In Odda&#x27;s lifetime the total landed assets of Pershore grew to 300 hides, but after the loss of its benefactor in 1056 about two-thirds were seized and given to Edward the Confessor&#x27;s new foundation at Westminster. The original single sheet which preserves the fullest version of King Edgar&#x27;s refoundation charter (though it need not be authentic) is marked by a number of textual alterations and erasures. Some of these changes may suggest a response to the abbey&#x27;s proprietary struggles.

From the early 12th century there is evidence that Pershore Abbey claimed possession of some of the relics of Saint Eadburh of Winchester, the sainted daughter of King Edward the Elder. Her body was initially buried at Nunnaminster (Winchester), but it was translated in the 960s to a more central spot in Winchester, and again to a shrine in the 970s. Among several possibilities, Susan Ridyard has suggested that the Eadburh whose relics were preserved at Pershore may have been a Mercian saint of that name whose identity had become obscure.

===Later Middle Ages===
The main building was begun in about 1100. In the fourteenth century it benefited greatly from the generosity of Adam de Harvington, Chancellor of the Exchequer 1327–30, who was a cousin, and eventually the heir, of the Abbot, William of Harvington. The abbey was dissolved in 1539. A monk of Pershore, named Richard Beerly, was one of those who gave evidence to Thomas Cromwell in 1536 about the misbehaviour of some of his brothers, writing that &quot;Monckes drynk an bowll after collacyon tell ten or xii of the clock, and cum to mattens as dronck as myss, and sume at cardes, sume at dyss.&quot; (Monks drink a bowl after collation until ten or twelve o&#x27;clock, and come to Matins as drunk as mice, some [playing] at cards, some at dice.)Pershore Abbey church was partly demolished after the reformation when it was surrendered to the King&#x27;s Commissioners in 1540; only the tower, choir, and south transept remain. The abbey church remained in use as a parish church. When the north transept collapsed in 1686, a wall was built in its place. Further alterations were carried out, including a restoration by George Gilbert Scott in 1862–64. Scott removed the belfry floor and opened up the lantern tower, exposing the internal tracery which he thought the best in England after that at Lincoln Cathedral. The tower pinnacles were added in 1871. In 1913, two western flying buttresses were added to replace the support from the missing portion of the building.

==Current structure and features==

The church as it now stands represents only a small portion of the original building. It is a Grade I listed building. Repairs in 1994 stabilised the south transept, strengthened its roof and repointed the tower and pinnacles. An underfloor heating system was also installed.

===Bells===
Pershore Abbey has a ring of eight bells, of which six were cast by the younger Abraham Rudhall in 1729. The treble was cast in 1814 by Thomas Mears of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. The cracked 4th (also 1729 by Rudhall) was recast by J. Barwell &amp; Sons of Birmingham with &quot;moderate success&quot; in 1897, the same year they were rehung. The largest bell (the tenor) is estimated to weigh 25½ cwt (2856 lbs.) and sounds the note D.

The ringing room, devised as part of Gilbert Scott&#x27;s 1862-64 restorations, is a metal &#x27;cage&#x27; suspended high above the chancel crossing; it is accessed by means of two stone spiral staircases, a walkway through the roof, a squeeze through a narrow passage and a see-through iron staircase.

The bells have the following inscriptions (in capital letters).
:1. (Treble) &quot;Joseph Martin and Thomas Evans churchwardens 1814&quot;
:2. &quot;Peace and good neighbourhood&quot; 
:3. &quot;Abr Rudhall of Gloucester cast all of us&quot; 
:4. &quot;Barwell Founder Birmingham. Prosperity to the Church of England 1729 Recast 1897&quot;
:5. &quot;Prosperity to all our benefactors A R 1729&quot; 
:6. &quot;Walter Marriott and Edmund Gale churchwardens A R 1729&quot; 
:7. &quot;Richard Roberts Esq John Yeend and Thomas Ashfield Gent[leme]n trustees A R 1729&quot; 
:8. (Tenor) &quot;I to the Church the living call: And to the grave do summon all&quot;

===Font===
In about 1840 the abbey was given a new baptismal font. The original Norman font was removed to the churchyard where it served as a cattle trough, and later as a garden ornament. In 1912 a war memorial was erected on the site of the Victorian font and the old font was re-instated, on a pedestal designed by Harold Brakspear. The font is decorated with an interlacing arcade, in the panels of which are the figures of Christ and his Apostles.

==Organ==
The earliest record of an organ in Pershore abbey is from the parish magazine for June 1825 which stated that the parishioners had started a voluntary subscription fund for the erection of an organ. This organ was built by Mr. Russell of London and opened by the organist Charles Clarke of Worcester Cathedral on 1 November 1826. This organ is thought to have functioned for 47 years when it was sold to Sedgley Parish Church. In 1864 it is recorded that during a restoration of the church, it was reconstructed by Nicholson of Malvern and moved to the north-east chapel. 

A new three manual organ was built by Nicholson of Malvern and opened on 18 April 1873. The Nicholson was restored twice by J. W. Walker &amp; Sons Ltd, in 1940 and 1971. This was replaced by a Bradford electronic organ.

A new pipe organ, costing around £850,000, was commissioned from the Fratelli Ruffatti workshop in Italy and installed in 2023.

Past organists and masters of music include Charles Tovey (1832-1868), William Hancox (1868-1869), Charles Henry Ogle (1869-1896), Edred Martin Chaundy (1898–1899, formerly of Enniskillen Parish Church, afterwards Holy Trinity Church, Stroud and Armagh Cathedral), Frank Alfred Charles Mason (1900–1949), Peter Bruce Waddington (1949-1951), Rodney Clifford Baldwyn (1951–1981), Ian Gerrard (1993–2003), Sheila Joynes (2003–2004), Mike Pegg (2004–2005), David Barclay (2005–2007) and Alex Crawford (2007–2008). In 2009, Mike Pegg resumed his former duties.
==Grounds==
The buried foundations of the other monastic buildings, which lie to the southwest of the church, were identified in an archaeological excavation in 1929.

At the Dissolution, these buildings and the abbey grounds were acquired by John Richardson. The buildings were demolished and the grounds passed through various owners. Abbey House was later built on the site, sometime in the 1830s. In 1910 its owner, Henry Wise, donated the house to the Anglican Benedictine monks of Caldey Abbey, Pembrokeshire. When these monks converted to Roman Catholicism in 1913, they returned Abbey House to Wise who then provided it for the use of the small remnant of monks from Caldey who had remained Anglican. In 1922 the monks bought the house. They left Pershore for Nashdom Abbey, Buckinghamshire, in 1926, but only sold Abbey House in 1947 when it was demolished and the grounds became housing and parkland.

<text>Jean de Joinville (, 1 May 1224 – 24 December 1317) was one of the great chroniclers of medieval France. He is most famous for writing the &quot;Life of Saint Louis&quot;, a biography of Louis IX of France that chronicled the Seventh Crusade.&quot;&quot;

==Biography==
Son of Simon of Joinville and , and brother of Geoffrey de Geneville, Jean belonged to a noble family from Champagne. He received an education befitting a young noble at the court of Theobald IV of Champagne, including reading, writing, and Latin. On the death of his father in 1233, he became lord of Joinville and seneschal of Champagne (and was therefore personally connected to Theobald IV). He was a very pious man and was concerned with the proper administration of the region.

In 1241, he accompanied Theobald to the court of Louis IX of France (the future Saint Louis). In 1244, when Louis organized the Seventh Crusade, Joinville decided to join with the Christian knights just as his father had done 35 years earlier against the Albigensians. At the time of the crusade, Joinville placed himself in the service of the king and became his counsellor and confidant. In 1250, when the king and his troops were captured by the Mameluks in the Battle of Al Mansurah, Joinville, among the captives, participated in the negotiations and the collection of the ransom. Joinville probably brought himself even closer to the king in the difficult times that followed the failure of the crusade (including the death of his brother Robert, Count of Artois). It was Joinville who advised the king to stay in the Holy Land instead of returning immediately to France as the other lords had wanted; the king followed Joinville&#x27;s advice. During the following four years spent in the Holy Land Joinville was the constant advisor to the king, who knew that he could count on Joinville&#x27;s frankness and absolute devotion.

In 1270, Louis IX, although very weakened physically, undertook a new crusade with his three sons. Any enthusiasm Joinville had for the previous crusade had been knocked out of him, and he refused to follow Louis, recognizing the uselessness of the enterprise and convinced that the duty of the king was not to leave the kingdom that needed him. In fact, the expedition was a worse disaster than its predecessor and the king died of dysentery outside Tunis on August 25, 1270.

From 1271, the papacy carried out a long inquest on the subject of Louis IX, which ended with his canonization, announced in 1297 by Pope Boniface VIII. As Joinville had been a close friend of the king, his counselor and his confidant, his testimony was invaluable to the inquest, where he appeared as a witness in 1282.

At the request of Jeanne of Navarre, the queen, he began work on the &quot;Histoire de Saint Louis&quot;, which he completed in 1309. Joinville died on 24 December 1317, at the age of 93, nearly fifty years after the death of Louis.

Jeanne of Navarre, wife of Philip IV of France (and granddaughter of Count Theobald IV), asked Joinville to write Louis&#x27; biography. He then put himself to the task of writing &quot;livre des saintes paroles et des bons faiz de nostre saint roy Looÿs&quot; (as he himself called it), today known as the &quot;Life of Saint Louis&quot;. Jeanne of Navarre died on 2 April 1305, while the work was not yet completed. Joinville dedicated it in 1309 to her son, Louis, king of Navarre and count of Champagne, the future Louis X of France.

===Composition and date===
As noted, the book was not completed when Jeanne of Navarre died in 1305. In addition, the oldest existing manuscript ends with this note: &quot; &quot;Ce fu escript en l&#x27;an de grace mil .CCC. et .IX. &quot;[1309]&quot;, ou moys d&#x27;octovre&quot; &quot;. This is not precisely the date of the writing of the manuscript, because it was obviously written later. Therefore, it is either the date of the completion of the work by Joinville, or the date of the manuscript which served as the model to the surviving copies. The work was therefore written between 1305 and 1309. By other evidence, one can equally argue that a passage at the very end of the book, relating a dream of Joinville, could not have been written before 1308. Joinville therefore finished his work a short time before giving it to Louis.

===Tradition of the text===
The surviving manuscripts consist of one old copy of the text and two later copies. The manuscript that was given to Louis has not survived.

The oldest manuscript is obviously very close to the original. It is found in the inventory of 1373 of the library of Charles V of France. Furthermore, according to the illuminations, it can be dated to the years 1330–1340, about 20 years after the original manuscript. This copy remained in the royal library and then passed to Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, before reaching Brussels, where it was lost. It was rediscovered only in 1746, when Brussels was taken by French troops. This Brussels manuscript is now located in the Bibliothèque nationale de France. It is one volume of 391 pages in two columns. The first page is decorated with gold and illuminations, and with a painting representing Joinville presenting his book to Louis. The text is divided into paragraphs, each beginning with a gilded letter.

Two editions have been created from one translation of Joinville&#x27;s text (which does not survive itself), created by Antoine Pierre in 1547 and by Claude Ménard in 1617 respectively. Pierre&#x27;s text is corrupted from the modifications of the original text and from fanciful additions, while Ménard&#x27;s is an excellent scholarly work.

Finally, a third copy of the text comes from two manuscripts which appear to date from the second quarter of the 16th century. These are modernized transcriptions with systematic renovation of the language, from one older manuscript and the Brussels manuscript.

===General perspectives on the work===
Joinville was a knight. He was neither a cleric skilled in composing books, nor a chronicler informed by researching written or oral information. Nevertheless, his writing is sincere and neutral. He wrote about everything he personally experienced during the reign of Saint Louis, essentially the crusade in Egypt and their stay in the Holy Land. His narrative is full of life, anecdotes and even humour. It is more of a personal testimony about the king than a history of his reign.
The freshness and precision of his memories are impressive, especially since he wrote his work some decades after the fact. Certain medievalists explain this by supposing that Joinville had often recounted his past orally or that he had previously committed it to writing before beginning his work.

Joinville speaks almost as much about himself as he does about the king, the subject of his book, but he does it in such a natural manner that he never gives the impression that he wants to place himself above the king. Thus we have an incomparable clarity about the ways of thinking of a 13th-century man. For this reason, modern editors have sometimes said the work is more of a memoir than a history or a biography of Saint Louis.

===The &quot;holy words&quot;===
The first part of Joinville&#x27;s work is dedicated to the holy words of the king. Joinville writes about the edifying words of the king and his Christian virtues.

Speeches are very important among Louis&#x27; court. His speech is moral and didactic, reflecting the speech of the preachers (Dominicans and Franciscans) who surround him. It transmits a moral and religious teaching and often aims to strengthen the faith of the recipient. An intimacy exists between the king and his followers (his family, confidants, and counselors, among whom are Joinville and Robert de Sorbon) who express themselves particularly in the conversation: the king invites his audience to respond to his questions, often with the aim of instructing them with moral and religious plans. This importance of the royal speech is particularly well rendered by Joinville, who often has his characters speak. He is one of the first memoirists to integrate reconstructed dialogue into a tale. He most often uses a direct style and marks the interventions of his characters with &quot;he said&quot; or &quot;he did.&quot; And Joinville never has his characters speak in long monologues: the lessons are always shown from dialogue.

In addition, it is through the words of the king that his profound faith and sanctity are shown. For Joinville, Louis IX embodies the ideal &quot;prud&#x27;homme&quot; - pious, courageous, kind, intelligent and wise, a man who defends the Christian faith by his courage. And in fact, in Joinville&#x27;s work he shows the king to have an ardent love of God, benevolent to his people, humble, moderate and courteous, wise and just, peaceful, loyal and generous. In some respects Joinville is sometimes not far from writing a hagiography.

Joinville, like his king, was obviously very attached to the Christian religion, to its doctrines, its morality and its practices. For proof of this there is a small work of edification, composed in 1250, titled &quot;li romans as ymages des poinz de nostre foi&quot;, where Joinville makes a brief commentary on the Credo. But his deep and sincere faith contrasts with the almost exalted Christian heroism of the king. The Christianity of Joinville is closer to that of the common people.

===The crusade===
Joinville recounts equally the high deeds of Saint Louis, in particular the unfolding of the Seventh Crusade and the following stay in the Holy Land, which occupies most of the book.

<doc id="106531" wikidata="Q2427503" url="?curid=106531" title="Operation Goodwood">
<text>Operation Goodwood was a British offensive during the Second World War, which took place between 18 and 20 July 1944 as part of the larger battle for Caen in Normandy, France. The objective of the operation was a limited attack to the south, from the Orne bridgehead, to capture the rest of Caen and the Bourguébus Ridge beyond.

Goodwood was preceded by Operations Greenline and Pomegranate in the Second Battle of the Odon west of Caen, to divert German attention from the area east of Caen. Goodwood began when the British VIII Corps, with three armoured divisions, attacked to seize the German-held Bourguébus Ridge, the area between Bretteville-sur-Laize and Vimont and to inflict maximum casualties on the Germans. On 18 July, the British I Corps conducted an attack to secure a series of villages to the east of VIII Corps; to the west, the II Canadian Corps launched Operation Atlantic, synchronised with Goodwood, to capture the Caen suburbs south of the Orne River. When the operation ended on 20 July, the armoured divisions had broken through the outer German defences and advanced but had been stopped short of Bourguébus Ridge, only armoured cars having penetrated further south and beyond the ridge.

While Goodwood failed in its primary aim, it forced the Germans to keep powerful formations opposite the British and Canadians on the eastern flank of the Normandy beachhead and Operation Cobra, the First US Army attack which began on 25 July, caused the weaker German defences opposite to collapse.

==Background==

===Caen===
The historic Normandy town of Caen was a D-Day objective for the British 3rd Infantry Division, which landed on Sword Beach on 6 June 1944. The capture of Caen, while &quot;ambitious&quot;, was called the most important D-Day objective assigned to I Corps (Lieutenant-General John Crocker). Operation Overlord called for Second Army to secure the city and then form a front line from Caumont-l&#x27;Éventé–south-east of Caen, to acquire space for airfields and to protect the left flank of the First US Army (Lieutenant General Omar N. Bradley), while it moved on Cherbourg. Possession of Caen and its surroundings would give the Second Army a staging area for a push south to capture Falaise, which could be used as the pivot for a swing left, to advance on Argentan and then towards the Touques River. The terrain between Caen and Vimont was especially promising, being open, dry and conducive to mobile operations. Since the Allied forces greatly outnumbered the Germans in tanks and mobile units, a fluid fast-moving battle was to their advantage.

Hampered by congestion in the beachhead and forced to divert effort to attack strongly held German positions along the route to the town, the 3rd Infantry Division was unable to assault Caen in force and was stopped short of the outskirts. Follow-up attacks were unsuccessful as German resistance solidified; abandoning the direct approach, Operation Perch—a pincer attack by I Corps and XXX Corps—was launched on 7 June, to encircle Caen from the east and west. I Corps, striking south out of the Orne bridgehead, was halted by the 21st Panzer Division and the attack by XXX Corps bogged down in front of Tilly-sur-Seulles, west of Caen, against the Panzer Lehr Division. The 7th Armoured Division pushed through a gap in the German front line and tried to capture the town of Villers-Bocage in the German rear. The Battle of Villers-Bocage saw the vanguard of the 7th Armoured Division withdraw from the town but by 17 June, Panzer Lehr had been forced back and XXX Corps had taken Tilly-sur-Seulles. The British postponed plans for further offensive operations, including a second attack by the 7th Armoured Division, when a severe storm descended upon the English Channel on 19 June. The storm lasted for three days, significantly delaying the Allied build-up. Most of the landing craft and ships already at sea were driven back to ports in Britain; towed barges and other loads (including of floating roadways for the Mulberry harbours) were lost and were stranded on the Normandy beaches, until the next high tides in July.

===Epsom, Windsor and Charnwood===
After a few days to recover from the storm, the British began Operation Epsom on 26 June. The newly arrived VIII Corps (Lieutenant-General Richard O&#x27;Connor), was to attack west of Caen, southwards across the Odon and Orne rivers, capture an area of high ground near Bretteville-sur-Laize, encircling the city. The attack was preceded by Operation Martlet, to secure the VIII Corps flank by capturing high ground on the right of the axis of advance. The Germans managed to contain the offensive by committing all their strength, including two panzer divisions just arrived in Normandy, earmarked for an offensive against British and American positions around Bayeux. Several days later, the Second Army made a frontal assault on Caen Operation Charnwood. The attack was preceded by Operation Windsor, to capture the airfield at Carpiquet just outside Caen. By 9 July, Caen north of the Orne and Odon rivers had been captured but German forces retained possession of the south bank and a number of important locations, including the Colombelles steel works, whose tall chimneys commanded the area.
Shortly after the capture of northern Caen, the British mounted a raid against the Colombelles steelworks complex to the north-east of the city, which was a failure. The factory area remained in German hands, its tall chimneys providing observation posts that overlooked the Orne bridgehead. At 01:00 on 11 July, elements of the 153rd (Highland) Infantry Brigade, supported by Sherman tanks of the 148th Regiment Royal Armoured Corps, moved against the German position. The intention was to secure the area for troops from the Royal Engineers to destroy the chimneys before retiring. At 05:00, the British force was ambushed by Tiger tanks and was forced to withdraw after losing nine tanks. The Second Army launched two preliminary operations; according to General Bernard Montgomery, their purpose was to &quot;engage the enemy in battle unceasingly; we must &#x27;write off&#x27; his troops; and generally we must kill Germans&quot;. Historian Terry Copp called this the moment where the Normandy campaign became a battle of attrition.

===Montgomery===
On 10 July, Montgomery, the commander of all the Allied ground forces in Normandy, held a meeting at his headquarters with Dempsey and Bradley. They discussed 21st Army Group operations, following the conclusion of Operation Charnwood and the failure of the First US Army break-out offensive. Montgomery approved Operation Cobra, an attack to be launched by the First US Army on 18 July. Montgomery ordered Dempsey to &quot;go on hitting: drawing the German strength, especially the armour, onto yourself—so as to ease the way for Brad&quot;.

In early July, Montgomery had been informed by the Adjutant-General to the Forces, Ronald Adam that due to the manpower shortage in Britain, the pool of replacements to maintain his infantry strength was nearly exhausted. Dempsey proposed an attack consisting solely of armoured divisions, a concept that contradicted Montgomery&#x27;s policy of never employing an unbalanced force. By mid-July, the Second Army had and in the bridgehead, of which in reserve to replace losses. The armoured element of the Second Army consisted of the Guards Armoured Division, 7th Armoured Division and the 11th Armoured Division and the 4th Armoured Brigade, 8th Armoured Brigade, 27th Armoured Brigade and 33rd Armoured brigades, the 31st and 34th Tank brigades and the 2nd Canadian Armoured Brigade.

At 10:00 on 13 July, Dempsey met with Crocker, Lieutenant-General Simonds of II Canadian Corps and O&#x27;Connor. Later that day, the first written order for Operation Goodwood—named after the Glorious Goodwood race meetings—was issued. The document contained only preliminary instructions and general intentions; it was to stimulate detailed planning, and alterations were expected. The order was also sent to senior planners in the United Kingdom so that air support for the operation could be secured. When VIII Corps had assembled in Normandy in mid-June, it was suggested that the corps be used to attack out of the Orne bridgehead, to outflank Caen from the east but Operation Dreadnought was cancelled when Dempsey and O&#x27;Connor doubted the feasibility of the operation.

==Prelude==

===Goodwood plan===


In the outline for Goodwood, VIII Corps, with three armoured divisions, would attack southwards out of the Orne bridgehead, a pocket of ground east of the river taken by the Allies on D-Day in Operation Deadstick. The 11th Armoured Division was to advance south-west over Bourguébus Ridge and the Caen–Falaise road, aiming for Bretteville-sur-Laize. The Guards Armoured Division was to push south-east to capture Vimont and Argences and the 7th Armoured Division, starting last, was to aim south for Falaise. The 3rd Infantry Division, supported by part of the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, was to secure the eastern flank by capturing the area around Émiéville, Touffréville and Troarn. The II Canadian Corps would simultaneously launch Operation Atlantic, a supporting attack on the VIII Corps western flank, to capture Caen south of the Orne river. The British and Canadian operations were tentatively scheduled for 18 July and Cobra was postponed for two days, to enable the First Army to secure its start line around Saint-Lô.

Detailed planning began on Friday 14 July but the next day, Montgomery issued a written directive ordering Dempsey to change the plan from a &quot;deep break-out&quot; to a &quot;limited attack&quot;. Anticipating that the Germans would be forced to commit their armoured reserves, rather than risk a massed British tank breakthrough, VIII Corps was instructed to &quot;engage the German armour in battle and &#x27;write it down&#x27; to such an extent that it is of no further value to the Germans&quot;. He was to take any opportunity to improve the Second Army&#x27;s position—the orders stated that &quot;a victory on the eastern flank will help us to gain what we want on the western flank&quot;—but not to endanger its role as a &quot;firm bastion&quot; on which the success of the forthcoming American offensive would depend. The objectives of the three armoured divisions were amended to &quot;dominate the area Bourguébus–Vimont–Bretteville&quot;, although it was intended that &quot;armoured cars should push far to the south towards Falaise, spread[ing] alarm and despondency&quot;. The objectives for the II Canadian Corps remained unchanged and it was stressed that these were vital, only following their achievement would VIII Corps &quot;&#x27;crack about&#x27; as the situation demands&quot;.

The 11th Armoured Division was to lead the advance, screen Cagny and capture Bras, Hubert-Folie, Verrières and Fontenay-le-Marmion. The divisional armoured brigade was to bypass most of the German-held villages in its area, leaving them to be dealt with by follow-up waves. The 159th Infantry Brigade, was initially to act independently of the armoured brigade and capture Cuverville and Démouville. The Guards Armoured Division, advancing behind the 11th Armoured Division, was to capture Cagny and Vimont. Starting last, the 7th Armoured Division was to move south beyond the Garcelles-Secqueville ridge. Further advances by the armoured divisions were to be conducted only on Dempsey&#x27;s order. The detailed orders for the II Canadian Corps were issued a day later, for the capture of Colombelles, the remaining portion of Caen and then be ready to move on the strongly held Verrières (Bourguébus) Ridge. If the German front collapsed, a deeper advance would be considered.

Second Army intelligence had formed a good estimate of the opposition Goodwood was likely to face, although the German positions beyond the first line of villages had to be inferred, mainly from inconclusive air reconnaissance. The German defensive line was believed to consist of two belts up to deep. Aware that the Germans were expecting a large attack out of the Orne bridgehead, the British anticipated meeting resistance from the 16th &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Field Division bolstered by SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment 25 of the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend. Signals intelligence found that the Hitler Youth had been moved into reserve and although it was slow to discover that SS-Panzergrenadier Regiment 25 was not with the 16th &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Field Division, having also been placed into reserve, this oversight was rectified before 18 July. Battle groups of the 21st Panzer Division with around and were expected near Route nationale 13. The 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler was identified in reserve with an estimated and and the presence of two heavy tank battalions equipped with Tiger tanks was established. German armoured strength was estimated at and artillery strength at and anti-tank guns. The Second Army believed that were in the centre of the battle zone, the flanks and the Caen–Vimont railway line. The British had also located a German gun line on the Bourguébus Ridge but its strength and gun positions were unknown.
To mask the operational objectives, the Second Army initiated a deception plan that included diversionary attacks launched by XII and XXX Corps. The three armoured divisions moved to their staging positions west of the Orne only at night and in radio silence; artillery fire was used to mask the noise of the tank engines. During the hours of daylight all efforts were made to camouflage the new positions.

For artillery support, Goodwood was allocated with of ammunition. The artillery consisted of pieces from regiments, guns from regiments, pieces from regiments and anti-aircraft guns from two heavy anti-aircraft regiments. The artillery was provided by I, VIII, XII and II Canadian Corps as well as the 2nd Canadian Army Group Royal Artillery (AGRA) and the 4th AGRA. Each field gun had each medium piece and each heavy gun or howitzer Prior to the assault these were to attempt to suppress German anti-tank and field artillery positions. During the attack they would provide the 11th Armoured Division with a rolling barrage and anti-aircraft defence. The guns would also assist the attacks launched by the 3rd Infantry and 2nd Canadian Infantry divisions and fire on targets as requested. Additional support would be provided by three ships of the Royal Navy, whose targets were German gun batteries located near the coast in the region of Cabourg and Franceville.
The engineering resources of the Second Army, I Corps and VIII Corps and the divisional engineers worked from to build six roads from west of the Orne River to the start lines east of the river and the Caen Canal. Engineers from I Corps strengthened bridges and built two new sets of bridges across the Orne and the canal. The engineers were also to construct another two sets of bridges by the end of the first day. II Canadian Corps planned to construct up to three bridges across the Orne as quickly as possible to give I Corps and VIII Corps exclusive access to the river and the canal bridges north of Caen. Engineers from the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division, with a small detachment from the 3rd Infantry Division, were ordered to breach the German minefield in front of the Highland Division. This was largely accomplished during the night of when they cleared and marked fourteen gaps. By the morning of 18 July, gaps had been completed, each for one armoured regiment to pass through at a time.

The 159th Infantry Brigade (11th Armoured Division) with the divisional and 29th Armoured Brigade headquarters, crossed into the Orne bridgehead during the night of and the rest of the division followed the next night. The Guards and 7th Armoured divisions were held west of the river until the operation began. As the final elements of the 11th Armoured Division moved into position and the VIII Corps headquarters took up residence in Bény-sur-Mer, more gaps in the minefields were blown, the forward areas were signposted and routes to be taken marked with white tape.

====Allied air forces====
Augmenting the preliminary artillery bombardment, and medium bombers of the Royal Air Force (RAF) and United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) would attack in three waves, in the largest air raid launched in direct support of ground forces in the campaign so far. Speed was of the essence and it was hoped that the aerial bombardment would pave the way for the 11th Armoured Division, rapidly to secure the Bourguébus Ridge. Dempsey believed that if the operation were to succeed, his tanks would need to be on the ridge by the first afternoon and cancelled a second attack by heavy bombers scheduled for then although this was to be in direct support of the advance towards the ridge, he was concerned that the 11th Armoured Division should not have to wait for it. Close air support for Goodwood would be provided by 83 Group RAF, to neutralise German positions on the flanks of VIII Corps, strong points such as the village of Cagny, attacking German gun and reserve positions and the interdiction of German troop movements. Each of the VIII Corps brigade headquarters was allocated a Forward Air Control Post.

===German preparations===
The Germans considered the Caen area to be the foundation of their position in Normandy and were determined to maintain a defensive arc from the English Channel to the west bank of the Orne. On 15 July, German military intelligence warned Panzer Group West that from 17 July, a British attack out of the Orne bridgehead was likely. It was thought that the British would push south-east towards Paris. General Heinrich Eberbach, the commanding officer of Panzer Group West, designed a defensive plan, with its details worked out by his two corps and six divisional commanders. A belt of at least depth was constructed, organised into four defence lines. Villages within the belt were fortified and anti-tank guns placed along its southern and eastern edges. To allow tanks to move freely within the belt, the Germans decided not to establish anti-tank minefields between each defensive line. On 16 July, several reconnaissance flights were mounted over the British front but most of these were driven off by anti-aircraft fire. As dark fell, camera-equipped aircraft managed to bring back photographs taken by the light of flares, which revealed a one-way flow of traffic over the Orne into the British bridgehead. Later that day, a British Spitfire was shot down over German lines while photographing defences; British artillery and fighters attempted to destroy the crashed aircraft without success.
LXXXVI Corps, reinforced by much artillery, held the front line. The 346th Infantry Division was dug in from the coast to the north of Touffreville and the depleted 16th &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Field Division held the next section from Touffreville to Colombelles. &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; von Luck, a battle group formed around the 21st Panzer Division 125th Panzergrenadier Regiment, was placed behind these forces with around The 21st Panzer Division armoured elements, reinforced with the 503rd Heavy Panzer Battalion, which included ten King Tigers, were north-east of Cagny in a position to support Luck&#x27;s men and to act as a general reserve and the rest of the divisional panzergrenadiers, with towed anti-tank guns and assault guns, were dug in amongst the villages of the Caen plain. The 21st Panzer Division reconnaissance and pioneer battalions, were positioned on the Bourguébus Ridge to protect the corps artillery, which consisted of around 48 field and medium guns with an equal number of &quot;Nebelwerfer&quot; rocket launchers. The LXXXVI Corps had pieces, and and anti-tank 88 mm guns. One battery of four anti-aircraft guns from the 2nd &quot;Flak-Sturm Regiment&quot;, was positioned in Cagny, while in the villages along the Bourguébus Ridge there was a screen of anti-tank guns from the 200th Tank Destroyer Battalion. Most of the LXXXVI Corps artillery was beyond the ridge covering the Caen–Falaise road.

Facing Caen to the west of the Caen–Falaise road was the I SS Panzer Corps. On 14 July, elements of the 272nd Infantry Division took over the defence of Vaucelles from the 1st SS Division Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler, who moved into local reserve between the village of Ifs and the east bank of the Orne. The following day the 12th SS Panzer Division was placed in &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; (&quot;OKW&quot;) reserve to rest and refit and—on Hitler&#x27;s orders—to be in a position to meet a feared second Allied landing between the Orne and Seine rivers. The divisional artillery regiment and anti-aircraft battalion remained behind to support the 272nd Infantry Division and two battle groups were detached from the division. &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; Waldmüller was moved close to Falaise and &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; Wünsche to Lisieux, east of Caen. Although &quot;Kampfgruppe&quot; Waldmüller was later ordered to rejoin the rest of the division at Lisieux, on 17 July Eberbach halted this move.

===Preliminary operations===

====Operation Greenline====

Operation Greenline was launched by XII Corps during the evening of 15 July, with the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division reinforced by a brigade of 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division, the 34th Tank Brigade, 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division and the 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division, minus one brigade. Greenline was intended to convince the German command that the main British assault would be launched west of the Orne, through the positions held by XII Corps and to tie down the 9th and 10th SS Panzer divisions, so that they could not oppose Goodwood or Cobra. Supported by the British attack made use of artificial moonlight and started well despite disruption caused by German artillery fire. By dawn XII Corps had captured several of its objectives including the important height of although the much-contested Hill 112 remained in German hands. By committing the 9th SS Panzer Division, the Germans managed by the end of the day to largely restore their line, although a counter-attack against Hill 113 failed. Attacks next day by XII Corps gained no further ground and during the evening of 17 July, the operation was closed down and the British force on Hill 113 withdrawn.

====Operation Pomegranate====

Operation Pomegranate began on 16 July, in which XXX Corps was to capture several important villages. On the first day British infantry seized a key objective and took but the next day there was much inconclusive fighting on the outskirts of Noyers-Bocage and Elements of the 9th SS Panzer Division were committed to the village defence. Although the British took control of the railway station and an area of high ground outside the village, Noyers-Bocage itself remained in German hands.

The preliminary operations cost Second Army for no significant territorial gains but Greenline and Pomegranate were strategically successful. Reacting to the threats in the Odon Valley, the Germans retained the 2nd Panzer and 10th SS Panzer divisions in the front line and recalled the 9th SS Panzer Division from Corps reserve. The Germans suffered around Terry Copp wrote that the fighting was &quot;one of the bloodiest encounters of the campaign&quot;. During the late afternoon of 17 July, a patrolling Spitfire spotted a German staff car on the road near the village of Sainte-Foy-de-Montgommery. The fighter made a strafing attack driving the car off the road. Among its occupants was Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, the commander of Army Group B, who was seriously wounded, leaving Army Group B temporarily leaderless.

==Battle==

===18 July===

Shortly before dawn on 18 July, the Highland infantry in the south of the Orne bridgehead, quietly retired from the front line. At 05:45, and Lancaster heavy bombers flying at dropped of high explosive bombs around Colombelles, the steelworks, on the positions of the 21st Panzer Division and on the village of Cagny, reducing half of it to rubble. At 06:40 the British artillery opened fire and twenty minutes later, the second wave of bombers arrived. From , American Marauders released of fragmentation bombs on the 16th &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Field Division, as fighter-bombers attacked German strong points and gun positions. During the bombardment, the troops and tanks of the 11th Armoured Division moved out of their concentration areas towards the start line. H Hour was set for 07:45 and on schedule, the artillery switched to a creeping barrage, which moved ahead of the 11th Armoured Division.
As the division moved off, more artillery opened fire on Cuverville, Demouville, Giberville, Liberville, Cagny and Émiéville and dropped harassing fire on targets as far south as Garcelles-Secqueville and Secqueville la Campagne. Fifteen minutes later, American heavy bombers dropped of fragmentation bombs in the Troarn area and on the main German gun line on the Bourguébus Ridge. Only in the three waves were lost, all to German anti aircraft fire. Aerial support for the operation was then handed over to 800 fighter-bombers of 83 Group and 84 Group.

The bombing put the 22nd Panzer Regiment and the III Company, 503rd Heavy Panzer Battalion temporarily out of action, causing varying degrees of damage to their tanks. Some were overturned, some were destroyed and twenty were later found abandoned in bomb craters. Most of the German front line positions had been neutralised, with the survivors left &quot;dazed and incoherent&quot;. Dust and smoke had impaired the ability of the bomber crews to identify all their targets and others on the periphery of the bombing zones had remained untouched. Cagny and Émiéville were extensively bombed but most of the defenders were unscathed and recovered in time to meet the British advance, both places having clear lines of fire on the route the British were to take. The 503rd Heavy Tank Battalion rallied rapidly and got to work digging out their tanks. On Bourguébus Ridge, a number of guns were destroyed by the bombing but most of the artillery and anti-tank guns remained intact.

By 08:05, the 2nd Fife and Forfar Yeomanry and the 3rd Royal Tank Regiment of the 29th Armoured Brigade had navigated minefields to reach the Caen–Troarn railway line. The first phase of the rolling barrage ended at 08:30, by which time large numbers of prisoners from the 16th &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; Division had been taken. By the time the artillery resumed firing at 08:50, only the first armoured regiment and a portion of the second had crossed the line. Although opposition was still minimal and more prisoners were taken, the two regiments struggled to keep up with the barrage and were moving out of supporting range of their reserves. On schedule, at 09:00, the barrage lifted and later, the lead squadrons reached the Caen–Vimont railway. In reserve, the 23rd Hussars had managed to clear the first railway line only to become embroiled in a -hour engagement with a battery of self-propelled guns of the 200th Assault Gun Battalion, that had been mistaken for Tiger tanks.
As the 2nd Fife and Forfar Yeomanry advanced past Cagny, they were engaged by anti-tank guns in Cagny to the east. Within a few minutes at least twelve tanks were disabled. The Yeomanry pressed their advance south and were engaged by the main German gun line on the ridge, while the 3rd Royal Tank Regiment, having shifted westward and exchanged fire with the German garrison in Grentheville, moved around the village and advanced along the southern outskirts of Caen, towards Bras and Hubert-Folie. What had been conceived as an attack towards the Bourguébus Ridge by three armoured divisions, had become an unsupported advance by two tank regiments, out of sight of one other, against massed German fire. By 11:15, the British had reached the ridge and the villages of Bras and Bourguébus. Some losses were inflicted on the German tanks but attempts to advance further were met by determined opposition, including fire from the rear from pockets of resistance that had been bypassed.

General Eberbach ordered a counter-attack, &quot;not a defensive move but a full armoured charge&quot;. The 1st SS Panzer Division was to attack across the ridge, while in the Cagny area the 21st Panzer Division was to recover the lost ground. German tanks started to arrive on the ridge around noon and the British tank crews were soon reporting German tanks and guns everywhere. Hawker Typhoon fighter-bombers, carrying RP-3 rockets, were directed onto the ridge during the afternoon, delaying and eventually breaking up the 1st SS Panzer Division counter-attack. A final attempt to storm the ridge resulted in the loss of tanks and a small counter-attack during the afternoon was driven off, with the destruction of six German Panthers.

Just before 10:00, the Guards Armoured Division caught up with the 11th Armoured Division and pressed on towards Cagny. By 12:00 the leading elements were halted, engaged in fighting. A German counter-attack against the 2nd Armoured Grenadier Guards by from the 21st Panzer Division and the Tigers of the 503rd Heavy Panzer Battalion, failed when the German tanks came under fire from their own guns and two Tigers were knocked out. An isolated Tiger II (King Tiger) attempting to manoeuvre out of danger, was caught by an Irish Guards Sherman tank that had also become detached from its unit. The Sherman crew fired into the Tiger and then rammed it; anti-tank fire from other British units then penetrated the Tiger&#x27;s armour. Both crews abandoned their vehicles and most of the German crew was captured. The 503rd Heavy Panzer Battalion later attacked the Coldstream Guards but was forced to withdraw by massed anti-tank fire. It took the Guards the rest of the day to capture Cagny, which was found abandoned when infantry entered the village. Attempts to resume the advance were met by determined German resistance. Starting last, the only element of the 7th Armoured Division to enter the battle was the 5th Royal Tank Regiment (5th RTR). At 17:00 near Cuverville it knocked out two Panzer IVs for the loss of four tanks and then cleared Grentheville, bypassed earlier in the day by the 3rd RTR, taking several prisoners. A German counter-attack by six tanks petered out after two tanks each were destroyed.
The 11th Armoured Division pulled back to the Caen–Vimont railway line for the evening and replacement tanks were brought forward for all divisions, with the 11th Armoured receiving priority. German recovery teams went forward to recover as many of their tanks as possible, as few replacements were available. Unnoticed by the British, a gap had been created between Emièville and Troan. This was closed during the night by the 12th SS Panzer Division, which had lost ten tanks, en route, to air attacks. A number of minor German counter-attacks were launched from the ridge; one at dusk was broken up by British artillery and anti-tank fire, which destroyed a Panther and Tiger, another after dark, led by a captured Sherman as a ruse, was repulsed after the Sherman and two Panthers were knocked out by a British anti-tank battery. During the night, German bombers dropped flares over the Orne bridges, which then came under aerial attack. One bridge was slightly damaged and the headquarters of the 11th Armoured Division was hit, as were some tank crews who had survived the fighting.

In their fighting around Cagny, the Guards Armoured Division lost fifteen tanks destroyed and damaged. The 11th Armoured Division lost forty of which were write-offs; the rest were damaged or had broken down. (The loss of 126 tanks of the that crossed the start line has been a common feature of accounts of Goodwood but the divisional commander, the VIII Corps historian and Chester Wilmot gave losses. Michael Reynolds gave and Christopher Dunphie The armoured divisions suffered during the day, Guards Armoured Division suffered the 7th Armoured Division had and the 11th Armoured Division had I Corps was to attack along the left flank of the main armoured thrust. The 3rd Division moved forward at 07:45 hours, supported by 27th Armoured Brigade.

The reaction of the troops of the 346th Infantry Division and the 16th Luftwaffe Field Division was varied; the villages of Sannerville and Banneville la Campagne had been well hit by the preliminary attack by RAF Bomber Command and both were in 3rd Infantry Division hands by noon. Touffreville was on the edge of the Bomber Command aiming point and held out until evening. There was much fighting in the mined and broken country through which the road ran to Troarn. Attacking by that route and from Sannerville, the 3rd Infantry Division found Troarn strongly defended and at nightfall was still about a mile short of the town. Between Manneville and Guillerville, south of the Troarn–Caen road, there was determined fighting against the German infantry of the 711th Infantry Division, rushed up by bicycle from the coast, supported by some Tiger tanks. It was midnight when both villages were cleared. The capture of its objectives, save for Troarn, cost the British 500 casualties and 18 tanks.

===Operation Atlantic===
On the Canadian front, Operation Atlantic began at 08:15, with a rolling barrage and infantry and tanks crossed their start line twenty minutes later. At 08:40, British infantry from the 159th Infantry Brigade entered Cuverville; the village and its surrounding area were secured by 10:30 but patrols found Demouville firmly held and attempts to capture this second objective were delayed while the infantry reorganised. The rest of the day saw a slow southward advance, as numerous German positions were cleared. Linking up with their armoured support by nightfall, the infantry dug in around le Mesnil-Frèmentel.

===19–20 July===
The German armour counter-attacked late in the afternoon and fighting continued along the high ground and around Hubert-Folie on 19 July and 20 July, bringing the attack to a halt. On 21 July, Dempsey started to secure his gains by substituting infantry for armour.

==Aftermath==

===Analysis===

Tactically, the Germans contained the offensive, holding many of their main positions and preventing an Allied breakthrough but they had been startled by the weight of the attack and preliminary aerial bombardment. It was clear that any defensive system less than deep could be overwhelmed at a stroke and the Germans could afford to man their defences in such depth only in the sector south of Caen. Goodwood resulted in the British extending the front line by to the east of Caen, with the penetration being as much as in some places; the southern suburbs of Caen were captured by the Canadians during Operation Atlantic.

The attack reinforced the German view that the greatest danger was on the eastern flank. As German armoured reinforcements arrived in Normandy, they were drawn into defensive battles in the east and worn down. By the end of July only one and a half panzer divisions were facing American forces at the western end of the front, compared with six and a half facing the British and Canadians at the eastern end of the bridgehead. The German defence of Normandy was close to collapse when Operation Cobra breached the thin German defensive &#x27;crust&#x27; in the west and few German mechanised units were available to counter-attack. Martin Blumenson, the American official historian, wrote after the war that had Goodwood created a breakthrough, &quot;... Cobra would probably have been unnecessary&quot;. Goodwood inflicted substantial losses on the German defenders but not a shattering blow. The effect on the morale of the German commanders was greater and added to the loss of Rommel, who was wounded in an RAF air attack. Kluge lost his early optimism on being appointed to replace Rundstedt and wrote to Hitler on 21 July predicting an imminent collapse.

Operation Goodwood was launched at a time of great frustration in the higher command of the Allies, which contributed to the controversy surrounding the operation. The Allied bridgehead was about 20 per cent of the planned size, which led to congestion and some fear of a stalemate. Allied commanders had not been able to exploit their potentially decisive advantages in mobility during June and early July 1944. Much of the controversy surrounding the objectives of the battle originates from the conflicting messages given by Montgomery. He talked up the objectives of Goodwood to the press on the first day, later saying that this was propaganda to encourage the Germans to keep powerful units at the east end of the battlefield.

In the planning of Goodwood, Montgomery appeared to promise that the attack would be a breakthrough and that when the VIII Corps failed to break-out, by some accounts the Supreme Commander, US General Dwight D. Eisenhower, felt he had been misled. While his intermittent communications to Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) appeared to promise a breakthrough, Montgomery was writing orders to his subordinates for a limited attack. Copies of orders forwarded to SHAEF called for an armoured division to take Falaise, a town far in the German rear. Three days prior to the attack, Montgomery revised the orders, eliminating Falaise as an objective but neglected to forward copies of the revision; Eisenhower was later furious at the result, which dogged Montgomery, as it allowed his detractors, especially Air Marshal Arthur Tedder, to imply that the operation was a failure.

Stephen Biddle wrote that Goodwood was a significant tactical setback for Montgomery. Despite having preponderant force and air superiority, British progress was slow and ultimately failed to break through. Montgomery chose an unusually narrow spearhead of just , which created a congested line of advance. British infantry was lacking in suitable junior officers and non-commissioned officers, which inhibited small-unit tactics. In Biddle&#x27;s analysis,

The Germans, by contrast, made great efforts to conceal their forces—moving under cover of dark, off the main roads, in small units and under radio silence.

===Casualties===
Colonel Charles Stacey, the Canadian official historian, gave casualties of all Canadian units in Europe, for the four days&#x27; fighting of all categories; were killed or died of wounds. In 2001, Michael Reynolds quoted the 21st Army Group war diary of casualties in I and VIII Corps of In 2004, Simon Trew wrote that &quot;the first estimates of Allied losses for Operation Goodwood appeared horrific, that Second Army had lost &quot;no conclusive assessment can ever be made&quot; in regards to the losses of both sides. In 2006, G. S. Jackson gave casualties in the armoured divisions from 18 to 19 July of Terry Copp wrote in 2007 that Operation Atlantic cost the Canadians from 1,349 to 1,965 casualties. In 2014, John Buckley gave a figure of during Goodwood and Atlantic.

Over prisoners were taken and tanks were destroyed. Jackson also wrote of tank losses. In the official history, Major Lionel Ellis, wrote that the 1st SS and 21st Panzer divisions lost on the first day of the battle. Reynolds recorded tanks or assault guns knocked out or damaged during the operation and that the claim of or assault guns destroyed—as stated in a post-war interview, by the commanding officer of the 11th Armoured Division, for a British staff college training film on the operation—&quot;can be accepted as accurate&quot;. Michael Tamelander wrote in 2004 that recorded the loss of during the period from 

British tank losses during Goodwood have been debated, with the loss ranging from In addition to VIII Corps losses, about twenty tanks were lost in the flanking operations. Reynolds wrote that study of the records suggests that the maximum number of tanks lost during Operation Goodwood was of which were damaged rather than write-offs. Tamelander and Zetterling wrote that during Goodwood 469 tanks were lost by the armoured divisions (including 131 tanks on 19 July and 68 on 20 July) but that the majority could be repaired. Trew rejected those figures and wrote that after much investigation, VIII Corps losses amounted to 197 tanks on 18 July, 99 tanks on 19 July and on 20 July, &quot;for a total of which completely destroyed&quot;. Trew wrote that &quot;the tank strength returns for VIII Corps show a loss of 218 tanks (that could not be repaired or immediately replaced), including 145 tanks from 11th Armoured Division&quot;. In 2014 John Buckley wrote that 400 British tanks were knocked out and that many were recovered and put back into service, although the morale of some of the crews deteriorated.

==History==
The County of Pallars was a county during the ninth and tenth centuries.
Later both the County of Pallars Jussà (Lower Pallars) and the County of Pallars Sobirà (Upper Pallars) became counties of the Hispanic March during the eleventh and twelfth centuries.

In 1936 the Pallars was split into the Pallars Jussà and Pallars Sobirà present-day administrative divisions. The historical Ribagorça territories administered by the Generalitat de Catalunya were added to the newly created Pallars Jussà comarca. In 1990 the Ribagorça area was segregated from the Pallars Jussà comarca and was established as the Alta Ribagorça.

<doc id="106534" wikidata="Q1514510" url="?curid=106534" title="County of Urgell">
<text>The County of Urgell (, ; ) is one of the historical Catalan counties, bordering on the counties of Pallars and Cerdanya.

==History==
The county of Urgell was carved by the Franks out of a former section of the Mark of Toulouse when the Alt Urgell area became part of the Carolingian Empire between 785 and 790.

The original territory was made up of the Alt Urgell, also known as Urgellet from the end of the 12th century onwards, with the see at La Seu d&#x27;Urgell. From 839 onwards it would include 129 villages, the valleys of the Valira river, namely Andorra and Sant Joan Fumat, the Segre riverine area as well as the valleys located between El Pont de Bar and Oliana.

Its maximal extension territory was between the Pyrenees and the taifa of Lleida, that is, the current comarques of Alt Urgell or Urgellet, Noguera, Solsonès, Pla d&#x27;Urgell, Baix Urgell and the still independent country of Andorra. The historical capital was first la Seu d&#x27;Urgell and later Balaguer. The county of Urgell was extinguished and absorbed by the Crown of Aragon in 1413 as a part of the Principality of Catalonia, after the revolt of the last count, James II of Urgell, against the king Ferdinand I of Aragon.

===First dynasty===
Sunifred II of Urgell (897–948) died without descendants and the county went to his nephew Borrell II, Count of Barcelona, Girona and Osona. In his testament Borrell II, who died in 992, gave Barcelona, Girona and Osona to Ramon Borrell (992–1017), while Urgell went to Ermengol I (992–1010), so that the Count of Urgell title became separated from the House of Barcelona. Thus the first dynasty of Urgell began with Ermengol I. The first dynasty is also known as Barcelona-Urgell.

* Ermengol I (992–1010), son of Borrell II, Count of Barcelona
* Ermengol II (1010–1038)
* Ermengol III (1038–1065)
* Ermengol IV (1065–1092)
* Ermengol V (1092–1102)
* Ermengol VI (1102–1154)
* Ermengol VII (1154–1184)
* Ermengol VIII (1184–1209)
* Aurembiaix (1209–1231)

The title was disputed by Peter I and Guerau IV de Cabrera during Aurembiaix&#x27;s time.

=== Second dynasty ===
In 1231 Countess Aurembiaix died without descendants and the first dynasty became extinguished. After a period of dynastic squabbles Jaume I acknowledged Ponç IV of Cabrera as the successor to the County of Urgell. The second dynasty is also known as Cabrera-Urgell.

*Ponç I (Ponç IV of Cabrera) (1236–1243)
*Ermengol IX (1243)

==Diocese of Urgell==

There is also a Roman Catholic diocese of Urgell. The diocese is of ancient origin and traditions of the early Christian church lingered. Felix of Urgel&#x27;s tendencies towards the heretical position of adoptionism was attacked by Alcuin of York in &quot;Contra Felicem&quot;.

Andorra was ceded to the bishop of Urgell by the count Ermengol VI of Urgell in the twelfth century. The bishop of Urgell, who since 2003 has been Joan Enric Vives Sicília, is simultaneously joint head of state of Andorra alongside the President of the French Republic.
