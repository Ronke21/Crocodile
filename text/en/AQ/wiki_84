<text>In mathematics, the general linear group of degree &quot;n&quot; is the set of invertible matrices, together with the operation of ordinary matrix multiplication. This forms a group, because the product of two invertible matrices is again invertible, and the inverse of an invertible matrix is invertible, with the identity matrix as the identity element of the group. The group is so named because the columns (and also the rows) of an invertible matrix are linearly independent, hence the vectors/points they define are in general linear position, and matrices in the general linear group take points in general linear position to points in general linear position.

To be more precise, it is necessary to specify what kind of objects may appear in the entries of the matrix. For example, the general linear group over R (the set of real numbers) is the group of invertible matrices of real numbers, and is denoted by GL&quot;n&quot;(R) or .

More generally, the general linear group of degree &quot;n&quot; over any field &quot;F&quot; (such as the complex numbers), or a ring &quot;R&quot; (such as the ring of integers), is the set of invertible matrices with entries from &quot;F&quot; (or &quot;R&quot;), again with matrix multiplication as the group operation. Typical notation is GL&quot;n&quot;(&quot;F&quot;) or , or simply GL(&quot;n&quot;) if the field is understood.

More generally still, the general linear group of a vector space GL(&quot;V&quot;) is the automorphism group, not necessarily written as matrices.

The [[#Special linear group|special linear group]], written or SL&quot;n&quot;(&quot;F&quot;), is the subgroup of consisting of matrices with a determinant of 1.

The group and its subgroups are often called linear groups or matrix groups (the automorphism group GL(&quot;V&quot;) is a linear group but not a matrix group). These groups are important in the theory of group representations, and also arise in the study of spatial symmetries and symmetries of vector spaces in general, as well as the study of polynomials. The modular group may be realised as a quotient of the special linear group .

If , then the group is not abelian.

== General linear group of a vector space ==

If &quot;V&quot; is a vector space over the field &quot;F&quot;, the general linear group of &quot;V&quot;, written GL(&quot;V&quot;) or Aut(&quot;V&quot;), is the group of all automorphisms of &quot;V&quot;, i.e. the set of all bijective linear transformations , together with functional composition as group operation. If &quot;V&quot; has finite dimension &quot;n&quot;, then GL(&quot;V&quot;) and are isomorphic. The isomorphism is not canonical; it depends on a choice of basis in &quot;V&quot;. Given a basis of &quot;V&quot; and an automorphism &quot;T&quot; in GL(&quot;V&quot;), we have then for every basis vector &quot;e&quot;&quot;i&quot; that
: formula_1
for some constants &quot;a&quot;&quot;ij&quot; in &quot;F&quot;; the matrix corresponding to &quot;T&quot; is then just the matrix with entries given by the &quot;a&quot;&quot;ji&quot;.

In a similar way, for a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; the group may be interpreted as the group of automorphisms of a &quot;free&quot; &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;M&quot; of rank &quot;n&quot;. One can also define GL(&quot;M&quot;) for any &quot;R&quot;-module, but in general this is not isomorphic to (for any &quot;n&quot;).

== In terms of determinants ==

Over a field &quot;F&quot;, a matrix is invertible if and only if its determinant is nonzero. Therefore, an alternative definition of is as the group of matrices with nonzero determinant.

Over a commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, more care is needed: a matrix over &quot;R&quot; is invertible if and only if its determinant is a unit in &quot;R&quot;, that is, if its determinant is invertible in &quot;R&quot;. Therefore, may be defined as the group of matrices whose determinants are units.

Over a non-commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, determinants are not at all well behaved. In this case, may be defined as the unit group of the matrix ring .

== As a Lie group ==

=== Real case ===

The general linear group over the field of real numbers is a real Lie group of dimension &quot;n&quot;2. To see this, note that the set of all real matrices, M&quot;n&quot;(R), forms a real vector space of dimension &quot;n&quot;2. The subset consists of those matrices whose determinant is non-zero. The determinant is a polynomial map, and hence is an open affine subvariety of M&quot;n&quot;(R) (a non-empty open subset of M&quot;n&quot;(R) in the Zariski topology), and therefore
a smooth manifold of the same dimension.

The Lie algebra of , denoted formula_2 consists of all real matrices with the commutator serving as the Lie bracket.

As a manifold, is not connected but rather has two connected components: the matrices with positive determinant and the ones with negative determinant. The identity component, denoted by , consists of the real matrices with positive determinant. This is also a Lie group of dimension &quot;n&quot;2; it has the same Lie algebra as .

The polar decomposition, which is unique for invertible matrices, shows that there is a homeomorphism between and the Cartesian product of O(&quot;n&quot;) with the set of positive-definite symmetric matrices. Similarly, it shows that there is a homeomorphism between and the Cartesian product of SO(&quot;n&quot;) with the set of positive-definite symmetric matrices. Because the latter is contractible, the fundamental group of is isomorphic to that of SO(&quot;n&quot;).

The homeomorphism also shows that the group is noncompact. “The” maximal compact subgroup of is the orthogonal group O(&quot;n&quot;), while &quot;the&quot; maximal compact subgroup of is the special orthogonal group SO(&quot;n&quot;). As for SO(&quot;n&quot;), the group is not simply connected (except when , but rather has a fundamental group isomorphic to Z for or Z2 for .

=== Complex case ===

The general linear group over the field of complex numbers, , is a &quot;complex&quot; Lie group of complex dimension &quot;n&quot;2. As a real Lie group (through realification) it has dimension 2&quot;n&quot;2. The set of all real matrices forms a real Lie subgroup. These correspond to the inclusions
:GL(&quot;n&quot;, R) &lt; GL(&quot;n&quot;, C) &lt; GL(&quot;2n&quot;, R),
which have real dimensions &quot;n&quot;2, 2&quot;n&quot;2, and . Complex &quot;n&quot;-dimensional matrices can be characterized as real 2&quot;n&quot;-dimensional matrices that preserve a linear complex structure — concretely, that commute with a matrix &quot;J&quot; such that , where &quot;J&quot; corresponds to multiplying by the imaginary unit &quot;i&quot;.

The Lie algebra corresponding to consists of all complex matrices with the commutator serving as the Lie bracket.

Unlike the real case, is connected. This follows, in part, since the multiplicative group of complex numbers C∗ is connected. The group manifold is not compact; rather its maximal compact subgroup is the unitary group U(&quot;n&quot;). As for U(&quot;n&quot;), the group manifold is not simply connected but has a fundamental group isomorphic to Z.

== Over finite fields ==

If &quot;F&quot; is a finite field with &quot;q&quot; elements, then we sometimes write instead of . When &quot;p&quot; is prime, is the outer automorphism group of the group Z, and also the automorphism group, because Z is abelian, so the inner automorphism group is trivial.

The order of is: 
: formula_3

This can be shown by counting the possible columns of the matrix: the first column can be anything but the zero vector; the second column can be anything but the multiples of the first column; and in general, the &quot;k&quot;th column can be any vector not in the linear span of the first columns. In &quot;q&quot;-analog notation, this is formula_4.

For example, has order . It is the automorphism group of the Fano plane and of the group Z. This group is also isomorphic to .

More generally, one can count points of Grassmannian over &quot;F&quot;: in other words the number of subspaces of a given dimension &quot;k&quot;. This requires only finding the order of the stabilizer subgroup of one such subspace and dividing into the formula just given, by the orbit-stabilizer theorem.

These formulas are connected to the Schubert decomposition of the Grassmannian, and are &quot;q&quot;-analogs of the Betti numbers of complex Grassmannians. This was one of the clues leading to the Weil conjectures.

Note that in the limit the order of goes to 0! – but under the correct procedure (dividing by ) we see that it is the order of the symmetric group (See Lorscheid&#x27;s article) – in the philosophy of the field with one element, one thus interprets the symmetric group as the general linear group over the field with one element: .

=== History ===
The general linear group over a prime field, , was constructed and its order computed by Évariste Galois in 1832, in his last letter (to Chevalier) and second (of three) attached manuscripts, which he used in the context of studying the Galois group of the general equation of order &quot;p&quot;&quot;ν&quot;.

== Special linear group ==
The special linear group, , is the group of all matrices with determinant 1. They are special in that they lie on a subvariety – they satisfy a polynomial equation (as the determinant is a polynomial in the entries). Matrices of this type form a group as the determinant of the product of two matrices is the product of the determinants of each matrix. is a normal subgroup of .

If we write &quot;F&quot;× for the multiplicative group of &quot;F&quot; (excluding 0), then the determinant is a group homomorphism
:det: GL(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;F&quot;) → &quot;F&quot;×.
that is surjective and its kernel is the special linear group. Therefore, by the first isomorphism theorem, is isomorphic to &quot;F&quot;×. In fact, can be written as a semidirect product:
:GL(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;F&quot;) = SL(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;F&quot;) ⋊ &quot;F&quot;×

The special linear group is also the derived group (also known as commutator subgroup) of the GL(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;F&quot;) (for a field or a division ring &quot;F&quot;) provided that formula_5 or &quot;k&quot; is not the field with two elements.

When &quot;F&quot; is R or C, is a Lie subgroup of of dimension . The Lie algebra of consists of all matrices over &quot;F&quot; with vanishing trace. The Lie bracket is given by the commutator.

The special linear group can be characterized as the group of &quot;volume and orientation-preserving&quot; linear transformations of R&quot;n&quot;.

The group is simply connected, while is not. has the same fundamental group as , that is, Z for and Z2 for .

== Other subgroups ==

=== Diagonal subgroups ===

The set of all invertible diagonal matrices forms a subgroup of isomorphic to (&quot;F&quot;×)&quot;n&quot;. In fields like R and C, these correspond to rescaling the space; the so-called dilations and contractions.

A scalar matrix is a diagonal matrix which is a constant times the identity matrix. The set of all nonzero scalar matrices forms a subgroup of isomorphic to &quot;F&quot;×. This group is the center of . In particular, it is a normal, abelian subgroup.

The center of is simply the set of all scalar matrices with unit determinant, and is isomorphic to the group of &quot;n&quot;th roots of unity in the field &quot;F&quot;.

=== Classical groups ===

The so-called classical groups are subgroups of GL(&quot;V&quot;) which preserve some sort of bilinear form on a vector space &quot;V&quot;. These include the
* orthogonal group, O(&quot;V&quot;), which preserves a non-degenerate quadratic form on &quot;V&quot;,
* symplectic group, Sp(&quot;V&quot;), which preserves a symplectic form on &quot;V&quot; (a non-degenerate alternating form),
* unitary group, U(&quot;V&quot;), which, when , preserves a non-degenerate hermitian form on &quot;V&quot;.
These groups provide important examples of Lie groups.

== Related groups and monoids ==

=== Projective linear group ===

The projective linear group and the projective special linear group are the quotients of and by their centers (which consist of the multiples of the identity matrix therein); they are the induced action on the associated projective space.

=== Affine group ===
The affine group is an extension of by the group of translations in &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot;. It can be written as a semidirect product:
:Aff(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;F&quot;) = GL(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;F&quot;) ⋉ &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot;
where acts on &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot; in the natural manner. The affine group can be viewed as the group of all affine transformations of the affine space underlying the vector space &quot;F&quot;&quot;n&quot;.

One has analogous constructions for other subgroups of the general linear group: for instance, the special affine group is the subgroup defined by the semidirect product, , and the Poincaré group is the affine group associated to the Lorentz group, .

=== General semilinear group ===

The general semilinear group is the group of all invertible semilinear transformations, and contains GL. A semilinear transformation is a transformation which is linear “up to a twist”, meaning “up to a field automorphism under scalar multiplication”. It can be written as a semidirect product:
:ΓL(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;F&quot;) = Gal(&quot;F&quot;) ⋉ GL(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;F&quot;)
where Gal(&quot;F&quot;) is the Galois group of &quot;F&quot; (over its prime field), which acts on by the Galois action on the entries.

The main interest of is that the associated projective semilinear group (which contains is the collineation group of projective space, for , and thus semilinear maps are of interest in projective geometry.

=== Full linear monoid ===
The Full Linear Monoid, derived upon removal of the determinant&#x27;s non-zero restriction, forms an algebraic structure akin to a monoid, often referred to as the full linear monoid or occasionally as the full linear semigroup or general linear monoid. Notably, it constitutes a regular semigroup.
If one removes the restriction of the determinant being non-zero, the resulting algebraic structure is a monoid, usually called the full linear monoid, but occasionally also &quot;full linear semigroup&quot;, &quot;general linear monoid&quot; etc. It is actually a regular semigroup.

== Infinite general linear group ==
The infinite general linear group or stable general linear group is the direct limit of the inclusions as the upper left block matrix. It is denoted by either GL(&quot;F&quot;) or , and can also be interpreted as invertible infinite matrices which differ from the identity matrix in only finitely many places.

It is used in algebraic K-theory to define K1, and over the reals has a well-understood topology, thanks to Bott periodicity.

It should not be confused with the space of (bounded) invertible operators on a Hilbert space, which is a larger group, and topologically much simpler, namely contractible – see Kuiper&#x27;s theorem.

<text>John Constable (; 11 June 1776 – 31 March 1837) was an English landscape painter in the Romantic tradition. Born in Suffolk, he is known principally for revolutionising the genre of landscape painting with his pictures of Dedham Vale, the area surrounding his home – now known as &quot;Constable Country&quot; – which he invested with an intensity of affection. &quot;I should paint my own places best&quot;, he wrote to his friend John Fisher in 1821, &quot;painting is but another word for feeling&quot;.

Constable&#x27;s most famous paintings include &quot;Wivenhoe Park&quot; (1816), &quot;Dedham Vale&quot; (1828) and &quot;The Hay Wain&quot; (1821). Although his paintings are now among the most popular and valuable in British art, he was never financially successful. He was elected to the Royal Academy of Arts at the age of 52. His work was embraced in France, where he sold more than in his native England and inspired the Barbizon school.

== Early career ==
John Constable was born in East Bergholt, a village on the River Stour in Suffolk, to Golding and Ann (Watts) Constable. His father was a wealthy corn merchant, owner of Flatford Mill in East Bergholt and, later, Dedham Mill in Essex. Golding Constable owned a small ship, &quot;The Telegraph&quot;, which he moored at Mistley on the Stour estuary, and used to transport corn to London. He was a cousin of the London tea merchant, Abram Newman. Although Constable was his parents&#x27; second son, his older brother was intellectually disabled and John was expected to succeed his father in the business. After a brief period at a boarding school in Lavenham, he was enrolled in a day school in Dedham, Essex. Constable worked in the corn business after leaving school, but his younger brother Abram eventually took over the running of the mills.

In his youth, Constable embarked on amateur sketching trips in the surrounding Suffolk and Essex countryside, which was to become the subject of a large proportion of his art. These scenes, in his own words, &quot;made me a painter, and I am grateful&quot;; &quot;the sound of water escaping from mill dams etc., willows, old rotten planks, slimy posts, and brickwork, I love such things.&quot; He was introduced to George Beaumont, a collector, who showed him his prized &quot;Hagar and the Angel&quot; by Claude Lorrain, which inspired Constable. Later, while visiting relatives in Middlesex, he was introduced to the professional artist John Thomas Smith, who advised him on painting but also urged him to remain in his father&#x27;s business rather than take up art professionally.
In 1799, Constable persuaded his father to let him pursue a career in art, and Golding granted him a small allowance. Entering the Royal Academy Schools as a probationer, he attended life classes and anatomical dissections, and studied and copied old masters. Among works that particularly inspired him during this period were paintings by Thomas Gainsborough, Claude Lorrain, Peter Paul Rubens, Annibale Carracci and Jacob van Ruisdael. He also read widely among poetry and sermons, and later proved a notably articulate artist.

In 1802 he refused the position of drawing master at Great Marlow Military College (now Sandhurst), a move which Benjamin West (then master of the RA) counselled would mean the end of his career. In that year, Constable wrote a letter to John Dunthorne in which he spelled out his determination to become a professional landscape painter:

His early style has many qualities associated with his mature work, including a freshness of light, colour and touch, and reveals the compositional influence of the old masters he had studied, notably of Claude Lorrain. Constable&#x27;s usual subjects, scenes of ordinary daily life, were unfashionable in an age that looked for more romantic visions of wild landscapes and ruins. He made occasional trips farther afield.

By 1803, he was exhibiting paintings at the Royal Academy. In April he spent almost a month aboard the East Indiaman as it visited south-east ports while sailing from London to Deal before leaving for China.

In 1806 Constable undertook a two-month tour of the Lake District. He told his friend and biographer, Charles Leslie, that the solitude of the mountains oppressed his spirits, and Leslie wrote:

Constable adopted a routine of spending winter in London and painting at East Bergholt in summer. In 1811 he first visited John Fisher and his family in Salisbury, a city whose cathedral and surrounding landscape were to inspire some of his greatest paintings.
To make ends meet, Constable took up portraiture, which he found dull, though he executed many fine portraits. He also painted occasional religious pictures but, according to John Walker, &quot;Constable&#x27;s incapacity as a religious painter cannot be overstated.&quot;

Another source of income was country house painting. In 1816, he was commissioned by Major-General Francis Slater Rebow to paint his country home, &quot;Wivenhoe Park, Essex&quot;. The Major-General also commissioned a smaller painting of the fishing lodge in the grounds of Alresford Hall, which is now in the National Gallery of Victoria. Constable used the money from these commissions towards his wedding with Maria Bicknell. This period of Constable&#x27;s painting is heavily populated with idyllic country scenes with heavy detail, notably his 1816 work &quot;The Wheat Field&quot;.

== Marriage ==

From 1809, his childhood friendship with Maria Elizabeth Bicknell developed into a deep, mutual love. Their marriage in 1816 when Constable was 40 was opposed by Maria&#x27;s grandfather, Dr. Rhudde, rector of East Bergholt. He considered the Constables his social inferiors and threatened Maria with disinheritance. Maria&#x27;s father, Charles Bicknell, solicitor to George IV and the Admiralty, was reluctant to see Maria throw away her inheritance. Maria pointed out to John that a penniless marriage would detract from any chances he had of making a career in painting. Golding and Ann Constable, while approving the match, held out no prospect of supporting the marriage until Constable was financially secure. After they died in quick succession, Constable inherited a fifth share in the family business.

John and Maria&#x27;s marriage in October 1816 at St Martin-in-the-Fields (with Fisher officiating) was followed by time at Fisher&#x27;s vicarage and a honeymoon tour of the south coast. The sea at Weymouth and Brighton stimulated Constable to develop new techniques of brilliant colour and vivacious brushwork. At the same time, a greater emotional range began to be expressed in his art. While on honeymoon, Constable began to experiment with works exploring nature&#x27;s grandeur, characterized by dominating skies, such as &quot;Osmington Bay&quot;.

Three weeks before their marriage, Constable revealed that he had started work on his most ambitious project to date In a letter to Maria Bicknell from East Bergholt, he wrote:

The picture was &quot;Flatford Mill (Scene on a Navigable River)&quot;. It was the largest canvas of a working scene on the River Stour that he had worked on to date and the largest he would ever complete largely outdoors. Constable was determined to paint on a larger scale, his objective not only to attract more attention at the Royal Academy exhibitions but also, it seems, to project his ideas about landscape on a scale more in keeping with the achievements of the classical landscape painters he so admired. Although Flatford Mill failed to find a buyer when it was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1817, its fine and intricate execution drew much praise, encouraging Constable to move on to the even larger canvases that were to follow.

== The ‘Six-Footers’ ==

Although he managed to scrape an income from painting, it was not until 1819 that Constable sold his first important canvas, &quot;The White Horse&quot;, described by Charles Robert Leslie as &quot;‘on many accounts the most important picture Constable ever painted&quot;&#x27;. The painting (without the frame) sold for the substantial price of 100 guineas to his friend John Fisher, finally providing Constable with a level of financial freedom he had never before known. &quot;The White Horse&quot; marked an important turning point in Constable’s career; its success saw him elected an associate of the Royal Academy and it led to a series of six monumental landscapes depicting narratives on the River Stour known as the ‘six-footers’ (named for their scale). The extraordinary size of the works helped Constable attract attention in the competitive space of the Academy&#x27;s exhibitions. Viewed as ‘the knottiest and most forceful landscapes produced in 19th-century Europe’, for many they are the defining works of the artist&#x27;s career. The series also includes &quot;Stratford Mill&quot;, 1820 (National Gallery, London); &quot;The Hay Wain&quot;, 1821 (National Gallery, London); &quot;View on the Stour near Dedham&quot;, 1822 (Huntington Library and Art Gallery, Los Angeles County); &quot;The Lock&quot;, 1824 (&quot;Private Collection&quot;); and &quot;The Leaping Horse&quot;, 1825 (Royal Academy of Arts, London).

The following year, his second six-footer &quot;Stratford Mill&quot; was exhibited. The Examiner described it as having &quot;‘a more exact look of nature than any picture we have ever seen by an Englishman’&quot;. The painting was a success, acquiring a buyer in the loyal John Fisher, who purchased it for 100 guineas, a price he himself thought too low. Fisher bought the painting for his solicitor and friend, John Pern Tinney. Tinney loved the painting so much, he offered Constable another 100 guineas to paint a companion picture, an offer the artist didn’t take up. Constable&#x27;s growing popularity in turn led to more lucrative commissions, such as &quot;Malvern Hall&quot; (1821, Clark Art Institute). 
In 1821, his most famous painting &quot;The Hay Wain&quot; was shown at the Royal Academy&#x27;s exhibition. Although it failed to find a buyer, it was viewed by some important people of the time, including two Frenchmen, the artist Théodore Géricault and writer Charles Nodier. According to the painter Eugène Delacroix, Géricault returned to France ’quite stunned‘ by Constable’s painting, while Nodier suggested French artists should also look to nature rather than relying on trips to Rome for inspiration. It was eventually purchased, along with &quot;View on the Stour near Dedham&quot;, by the Anglo-French dealer John Arrowsmith, in 1824. A small painting &quot;Yarmouth Jetty&quot; was added to the bargain by Constable, with the sale totalling £250. Both paintings were exhibited at the Paris Salon that year, where they caused a sensation, with the Hay Wain being awarded a gold medal by Charles X. The Hay Wain was later acquired by the collector Henry Vaughan who donated it to the National Gallery in 1886.

Of Constable&#x27;s colour, Delacroix wrote in his journal: &quot;What he says here about the green of his meadows can be applied to every tone&quot;. Delacroix repainted the background of his 1824 &quot;Massacre de Scio&quot; after seeing the Constables at Arrowsmith&#x27;s Gallery, which he said had done him a great deal of good.
A number of distractions meant that &quot;The Lock&quot; wasn&#x27;t finished in time for the 1823 exhibition, leaving the much smaller &quot;Salisbury Cathedral from the Bishop&#x27;s Grounds&quot; as the artist&#x27;s main entry. This may have occurred after Fisher forwarded Constable the money for the painting. This both helped him out of a financial difficulty and nudged him along to get the painting done. &quot;The Lock&quot; was therefore exhibited the following year to more fanfare and sold for 150 guineas on the first day of the exhibition, the only Constable ever to do so. &quot;The Lock&quot; is the only upright landscape of the Stour series and the only six-footer that Constable painted more than one version of. A second version now known as the ‘Foster version’ was painted in 1825 and kept by the artist to send to exhibitions. A third, landscape version, known as &quot;A Boat Passing a Lock&quot; (1826) is now in the collection of the Royal Academy of Arts. Constable’s final attempt, &quot;The Leaping Horse&quot;, was the only six-footer from the Stour series that didn’t sell in Constable’s lifetime.

== Later life ==

Constable’s pleasure at his own success was dampened after his wife started displaying symptoms of tuberculosis. Her growing illness meant that Constable took lodgings for his family in Brighton from 1824 until 1828, in the hope the sea air could restore her health. During this period Constable split his time between Charlotte Street in London and Brighton. This change saw Constable move away from large scale Stour scenes in favour of coastal scenes. He continued painting six-foot canvases, although he was initially unsure of the suitability of Brighton as a subject for painting. In a letter to Fisher in 1824 he wrote

In his lifetime, Constable sold only 20 paintings in England, but in France he sold more than 20 in just a few years. Despite this, he refused all invitations to travel internationally to promote his work, writing to Francis Darby: &quot;I would rather be a poor man [in England] than a rich man abroad.&quot;
In 1825, perhaps due partly to the worry of his wife&#x27;s ill-health, the uncongeniality of living in Brighton (&quot;Piccadilly by the seaside&quot;), and the pressure of numerous outstanding commissions, he quarreled with Arrowsmith and lost his French outlet.
&quot;Chain Pier, Brighton&quot; was his only ambitious six-foot painting of a Brighton subject, it was exhibited in 1827. The Constables persevered in Brighton for five years to aid Maria’s health, but to no avail. After the birth of their seventh child in January 1828, they returned to Hampstead where Maria died on 23 November at the age of 41. Intensely saddened, Constable wrote to his brother Golding, &quot;hourly do I feel the loss of my departed Angel—God only knows how my children will be brought up...the face of the World is totally changed to me&quot;.

Thereafter, he dressed in black and was, according to Leslie, &quot;a prey to melancholy and anxious thoughts&quot;. He cared for his seven children alone for the rest of his life. The children were John Charles, Maria Louisa, Charles Golding, Isobel, Emma, Alfred, and Lionel. Only Charles Golding Constable produced offspring. Several of Constable&#x27;s children also painted, notably his son Lionel. While Lionel eventually gave up painting for photography, several of his works are within the collection of the Clark Art Institute.

Shortly before Maria died, her father had also died, leaving her £20,000. Constable speculated disastrously with the money, paying for the engraving of several mezzotints of some of his landscapes in preparation for a publication. He was hesitant and indecisive, nearly fell out with his engraver, and when the folios were published, could not interest enough subscribers. Constable collaborated closely with mezzotinter David Lucas on 40 prints after his landscapes, one of which went through 13 proof stages, corrected by Constable in pencil and paint. Constable said, &quot;Lucas showed me to the public without my faults&quot;, but the venture was not a financial success.
This period saw his art move from the serenity of its earlier phase, to a more broken and accented style. The turmoil and distress of his mind is clearly seen in his later six-foot masterpieces &quot;Hadleigh Castle&quot; (1829) and &quot;Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows&quot; (1831), which are amongst his most expressive pieces.

He was elected to the Royal Academy in February 1829, at the age of 52. In 1831 he was appointed Visitor at the Royal Academy, where he seems to have been popular with the students.

He began to deliver public lectures on the history of landscape painting, which were attended by distinguished audiences. In a series of lectures at the Royal Institution, Constable proposed a three-fold thesis: firstly, landscape painting is scientific as well as poetic; secondly, the imagination cannot alone produce art to bear comparison with reality; and thirdly, no great painter was ever self-taught.

He also spoke against the new Gothic Revival movement, which he considered mere &quot;imitation&quot;.

In 1835, his last lecture to students of the Royal Academy, in which he praised Raphael and called the Academy the &quot;cradle of British art&quot;, was &quot;cheered most heartily&quot;. He died on the night of 31 March 1837, apparently from heart failure, and was buried with Maria in the graveyard of St John-at-Hampstead Church in Hampstead in London. (His children John Charles Constable and Charles Golding Constable are also buried in this family tomb.)

== Locations ==
Bridge Cottage is a National Trust property, open to the public. Nearby Flatford Mill and Willy Lott&#x27;s Cottage (the house visible in &quot;The Hay Wain&quot;) are used by the Field Studies Council for courses. The largest collection of original Constable paintings outside London is on display at Christchurch Mansion in Ipswich. Somerville College, Oxford is in possession of a portrait by Constable.

== Art ==

Constable quietly rebelled against the artistic culture that taught artists to use their imagination to compose their pictures rather than nature itself. He told Leslie, &quot;When I sit down to make a sketch from nature, the first thing I try to do is to forget that I have ever seen a picture&quot;.

Constable attributed his gift &#x27;to all that lay on the Stour river&#x27;, however, biographer Anthony Bailey attributed his artistic development to the influence of his well to do relative, Thomas Allen and the London contacts he introduced Constable to.

Although Constable produced paintings throughout his life for the &quot;finished&quot; picture market of patrons and R.A. exhibitions, constant refreshment in the form of on-the-spot studies was essential to his working method. He was never satisfied with following a formula. &quot;The world is wide&quot;, he wrote, &quot;no two days are alike, nor even two hours; neither were there ever two leaves of a tree alike since the creation of all the world; and the genuine productions of art, like those of nature, are all distinct from each other.&quot;

Constable painted many full-scale preliminary sketches of his landscapes to test the composition in advance of finished pictures. These large sketches, with their free and vigorous brushwork, were revolutionary at the time, and they continue to interest artists, scholars and the general public. The oil sketches of &quot;The Leaping Horse&quot; and &quot;The Hay Wain&quot;, for example, convey a vigour and expressiveness missing from Constable&#x27;s finished paintings of the same subjects. Possibly more than any other aspect of Constable&#x27;s work, the oil sketches reveal him in retrospect to have been an &quot;avant-garde&quot; painter, one who demonstrated that landscape painting could be taken in a totally new direction.

Constable&#x27;s watercolours were also remarkably free for their time: the almost mystical &quot;Stonehenge&quot;, 1835, with its double rainbow, is often considered to be one of the greatest watercolours ever painted. When he exhibited it in 1836, Constable appended a text to the title: &quot;The mysterious monument of Stonehenge, standing remote on a bare and boundless heath, as much unconnected with the events of past ages as it is with the uses of the present, carries you back beyond all historical records into the obscurity of a totally unknown period.&quot;

In addition to the full-scale oil sketches, Constable completed numerous observational studies of landscapes and clouds, determined to become more scientific in his recording of atmospheric conditions. The power of his physical effects was sometimes apparent even in the full-scale paintings which he exhibited in London; &quot;The Chain Pier&quot;, 1827, for example, prompted a critic to write: &quot;the atmosphere possesses a characteristic humidity about it, that almost imparts the wish for an umbrella&quot;.
The sketches themselves were the first ever done in oils directly from the subject in the open air, with the notable exception of the oil sketches Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes made in Rome around 1780. To convey the effects of light and movement, Constable used broken brushstrokes, often in small touches, which he scumbled over lighter passages, creating an impression of sparkling light enveloping the entire landscape. One of the most expressionistic and powerful of all his studies is &quot;Seascape Study with Rain Cloud&quot;, painted about 1824 at Brighton, which captures with slashing dark brushstrokes the immediacy of an exploding cumulus shower at sea. Constable also became interested in painting rainbow effects, for example in &quot;Salisbury Cathedral from the Meadows&quot;, 1831, and in &quot;Cottage at East Bergholt&quot;, 1833.

To the sky studies he added notes, often on the back of the sketches, of the prevailing weather conditions, direction of light, and time of day, believing that the sky was &quot;the key note, the standard of scale, and the chief organ of sentiment&quot; in a landscape painting. In this habit he is known to have been influenced by the pioneering work of the meteorologist Luke Howard on the classification of clouds; Constable&#x27;s annotations of his own copy of &quot;Researches About Atmospheric Phaenomena&quot; by Thomas Forster show him to have been fully abreast of meteorological terminology. &quot;I have done a good deal of skying&quot;, Constable wrote to Fisher on 23 October 1821; &quot;I am determined to conquer all difficulties, and that most arduous one among the rest&quot;.

Constable once wrote in a letter to Leslie, &quot;My limited and abstracted art is to be found under every hedge, and in every lane, and therefore nobody thinks it worth picking up&quot;. He could never have imagined how influential his honest techniques would turn out to be. Constable&#x27;s art inspired not only contemporaries like Géricault and Delacroix, but the Barbizon School, and the French impressionists of the late nineteenth century.

In 2019 two drawings by Constable were found among the possessions of the late playwright and poet, Christopher Fry; the drawings later sold for £60,000 and £32,000 at auction.

<text>Castle Howard is an English country house in Henderskelfe, North Yorkshire, north of York. A private residence, it has been the home of the Carlisle branch of the Howard family for more than 300 years. Castle Howard has been used as a filming location in several films and television shows, including in Granada Television&#x27;s 1981 television adaptation of Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot; and in a 2008 film adaptation.

==History==
In 1577, the 4th Duke of Norfolk&#x27;s third son, Lord William Howard, married his step-sister Elizabeth Dacre, youngest daughter of the 4th Baron Dacre. She brought with her the sizable estates of Henderskelfe in Yorkshire and Naworth Castle in Cumberland. Castle Howard was commissioned by the 3rd Earl of Carlisle, who was a male-line descendant of Lord William Howard. The site selected was part of the Henderskelfe estate. The creation of Castle Howard, began in 1699, with the start of design work by John Vanbrugh. It was completed with the decoration of the Long Gallery in 1811.

The house is surrounded by a large estate which, at the time of the 7th Earl of Carlisle, covered over and included the villages of Welburn, Bulmer, Slingsby, Terrington and Coneysthorpe. The estate was served by its own railway station, Castle Howard station, from 1845 to the 1950s. While attending Girton College during the early Edwardian era, Lady Dorothy Georgiana Howard, the daughter of the 9th Earl and &quot;Radical Countess&quot; of Carlisle, befriended six of her fellow students, including the future archaeologist Gisela Richter and future candidate for Roman Catholic Sainthood Anna Abrikosova. All six were invited by Lady Dorothy to Castle Howard as guests during holidays. After the death of the 9th Earl in 1911, Castle Howard was inherited by his fifth son, Geoffrey Howard, with later earls having Naworth Castle as their northern country house. Henry &#x27;Chips&#x27; Channon, the diarist and future Conservative MP, visited Castle Howard in August 1923 and recounted in his diary that &#x27;The house is uncomfortable in the extreme and is badly kept up. Everywhere there are signs of decaying magnificence.&#x27; Channon added that &#x27;The galleries are reminiscent of the Vatican with their hundreds of busts and statues of emperors and gods. The great library is an enormous narrow red room the length of the house and is hung with enough paintings to found a museum.&#x27; 

In 1952, Castle Howard was opened to the public by its then-owner, Lord Howard of Henderskelfe, a younger son of Geoffrey Howard. It is now owned by a Howard family company, Castle Howard Estate Limited, and managed by the Hon. Nicholas Howard (the second son of Lord Howard of Henderskelfe) and his wife, Victoria.

==House==
The 3rd Earl of Carlisle first spoke to William Talman, a leading architect, but commissioned Vanbrugh, a fellow member of the Kit-Cat Club, to design the building. Castle Howard was that gentleman-dilettante&#x27;s first foray into architecture, but he was assisted by Nicholas Hawksmoor. Vanbrugh&#x27;s design evolved into a Baroque structure with two symmetrical wings projecting to either side of a north–south axis. The crowning central dome was added to the design at a late stage, after building had begun. Construction began at the east end, with the East Wing constructed from 1701 to 1703, the east end of the Garden Front from 1701 to 1706, the Central Block (including dome) from 1703 to 1706, and the west end of the Garden Front from 1707 to 1709. All are exuberantly decorated in Baroque style, with coronets, cherubs, urns and cyphers, with Roman Doric pilasters on the north front and Corinthian on the south. Many interiors were decorated by Giovanni Antonio Pellegrini.

The Earl then turned his energies to the surrounding garden and grounds. Although the complete design is shown in the third volume of Colen Campbell&#x27;s &quot;Vitruvius Britannicus&quot;, published in 1725, the West Wing was not yet started when Vanbrugh died in 1726, despite his remonstration with the Earl. The house remained incomplete on the death of the 3rd Earl in 1738, but the remaining construction finally started at the direction of the 4th Earl. Vanbrugh&#x27;s design was not completed: the West Wing was built in a contrasting Palladian style to a design by the 3rd Earl&#x27;s son-in-law, Sir Thomas Robinson. The new wing remained incomplete, with no first floor or roof, at the death of the 4th Earl in 1758. Although a roof had been added, the interior remained undecorated by the death of Robinson in 1777. Rooms were completed stage by stage over the following decades, but the whole was not completed until 1811 under Charles Heathcote Tatham.

A large part of the house was destroyed by a fire on 9 November 1940. The dome, the central hall, the dining room and the staterooms on the east side were entirely destroyed. Antonio Pellegrini&#x27;s ceiling decoration, the &quot;Fall of Phaeton&quot;, was lost when the dome collapsed. In total, twenty pictures (including two Tintorettos) and several valuable mirrors were lost. The fire took the Malton and York Fire Brigades eight hours to bring under control. Some of the devastated rooms have been restored over the following decades. In 1960–61 the dome was rebuilt, and in the following couple of years Pellegrini&#x27;s &quot;Fall of Phaeton&quot; was recreated on the underside of the dome. The East Wing remains a shell, although it has been re-roofed. In 2009 an underwater ground-source heat recovery system was installed under the castle&#x27;s lake that halved the heating bill. According to figures released by the Association of Leading Visitor Attractions, over 269,000 people visited Castle Howard in 2019.

==Gardens==
Castle Howard has extensive and diverse gardens. There is a large formal garden immediately behind (i.e., on the south side of) the house. The house is prominently situated on a ridge and this was exploited in the development of an English landscape park, which adjoins and opens out from the formal garden. The gardens are Grade I listed on the National Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

Two major garden buildings are set in this landscape: the Temple of the Four Winds at the end of the garden, and The Mausoleum in the park. There is a lake on either side of the house. There is a woodland garden, Ray Wood, immediately east of the house, and the Walled Garden which contains decorative rose and flower gardens. The Ray Wood walls date from the 18th century and were restored in 2007.

Further buildings outside the preserved gardens include The Pyramid, restored in 2015, The Obelisk, and several follies and eyecatchers in the form of fortifications which have been restored in recent years; these include Carrmire Gate and Pyramid Gate. In nearby Pretty Wood, there are two more monuments, The Four Faces and a smaller pyramid by Hawksmoor.

Located on the estate, but operating separately from the house and gardens and run by an entirely independent charitable trust, is the Yorkshire Arboretum.

==Listed status==
The house is Grade I listed and there are many other listed structures on the estate, several of which are on the Heritage at Risk Register.

==In media==
Castle Howard&#x27;s most famous appearance in film was as Brideshead Castle in both the 1981 TV series and the 2008 film adaptations of Evelyn Waugh&#x27;s novel &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;. It has been used as a location in many other TV and film productions including: the 1965 film &quot;Lady L&quot;; the 1966 film &quot;The Spy with a Cold Nose&quot;; Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1975 film &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;; the 1995 mini-series &quot;The Buccaneers&quot;; the 2006 film &quot;&quot;; the 2013 TV series &quot;Death Comes to Pemberley&quot;; the 2015 Bollywood film &quot;Shaandar&quot;; in the 2016 ITV series &quot;Victoria&quot;; and the 2020 Netflix series &quot;Bridgerton&quot; (2020).

<text>Historic Scotland () was an executive agency of the Scottish Office and later the Scottish Government from 1991 to 2015, responsible for safeguarding Scotland&#x27;s built heritage and promoting its understanding and enjoyment. Under the terms of a Bill of the Scottish Parliament published on 3 March 2014, Historic Scotland was dissolved and its functions were transferred to Historic Environment Scotland (HES) on 1 October 2015. HES also took over the functions of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland.

==Role==
Historic Scotland was a successor organisation to the Ancient Monuments Division of the Ministry of Works and the Scottish Development Department. It was created as an agency in 1991 and was attached to the Scottish Executive Education Department, which embraces all aspects of the cultural heritage, in May 1999. As part of the Scottish Government, Historic Scotland was directly accountable to the Scottish Ministers.

In 2002, proposals to restore Castle Tioram in the West Highlands by putting a roof back on were blocked by Historic Scotland, which favoured stabilising it as a ruin. This position was supported in an extensive local Public Inquiry at which the arguments for both sides were heard. It has been implied that this dispute has led to a review of the operations of the organisation.

After widespread consultation, Historic Scotland published a comprehensive series of Scottish Historic Environment Policy papers, consolidated into a single volume, in October 2008.

The agency&#x27;s &quot;Framework Document&quot; sets out the responsibilities of the Scottish Ministers and the agency&#x27;s Chief Executive. Its Corporate Plan sets out its targets and performance against them.

Historic Scotland and the Glasgow School of Art&#x27;s Digital Design Studio formed the Centre for Digital Documentation and Visualization to promote the documentation and 3D representation of heritage objects, architecture, and environments with laser scanning and 3D visualization software.

==Properties==

Historic Scotland had direct responsibility for maintaining and running over 360 monuments in its care, about a quarter of which are staffed and charge admission. These properties have additional features such as guidebooks, books, and other resources. Historic Scotland sought to increase the number of events run at its sites, most frequently designed to engage young people with history. Similarly, new museums and visitor centres were opened, notably at Arbroath Abbey and Urquhart Castle. There was also a hospitality section, which makes some properties available for wedding receptions and other functions.

==Membership==
Membership in Historic Scotland was promoted by the organisation, with benefits such as free entry to all their properties and over 400 events for the duration of the annual membership, as well as half-price entry to properties in England (under the care of English Heritage), Wales (under the care of Cadw), and the Isle of Man (under the care of Manx National Heritage), becoming free in subsequent years. Lifetime memberships were also available, and all members received the quarterly magazine &#x27;Historic Scotland&#x27;.

<text>Robert Adam (3 July 17283 March 1792) was a British neoclassical architect, interior designer and furniture designer. He was the son of William Adam (1689–1748), Scotland&#x27;s foremost architect of the time, and trained under him. With his older brother John, Robert took on the family business, which included lucrative work for the Board of Ordnance, after William&#x27;s death.

In 1754, he left for Rome, spending nearly five years on the continent studying architecture under Charles-Louis Clérisseau and Giovanni Battista Piranesi. On his return to Britain he established a practice in London, where he was joined by his younger brother James. Here he developed the &quot;Adam Style&quot;, and his theory of &quot;movement&quot; in architecture, based on his studies of antiquity and became one of the most successful and fashionable architects in the country. Adam held the post of Architect of the King&#x27;s Works from 1761 to 1769.

Robert Adam was a leader of the first phase of the classical revival in England and Scotland from around 1760 until his death. He influenced the development of Western architecture, both in Europe and in North America. Adam designed interiors and fittings as well as houses. Much of his work consisted of remodelling existing houses, as well as contributions to Edinburgh&#x27;s townscape and designing romantic pseudo-mediaeval country houses in Scotland.

He served as the member of Parliament for Kinross-shire from 1768 to 1774.

==Biography==

===Early life===

Adam was born on 3 July 1728 at Gladney House in Kirkcaldy, Fife, the second son of Mary Robertson (1699–1761), the daughter of William Robertson of Gladney, and architect William Adam. As a child he was noted as having a &quot;feeble constitution&quot;. From 1734 at the age of six Adam attended the Royal High School, Edinburgh where he learned Latin (from the second year lessons were conducted in Latin) until he was 15, he was taught to read works by Virgil, Horace, Sallust and parts of Cicero and in his final year Livy. 

In autumn 1743, he matriculated at the University of Edinburgh, and compulsory classes for all students were: the Greek language, logic, metaphysics and natural philosophy. Students could choose three elective subjects, Adam attended classes in mathematics, taught by Colin Maclaurin, and anatomy, taught by Alexander Monro &quot;primus&quot;. His studies were interrupted by the arrival of Bonnie Prince Charlie and his Highlanders, who occupied Edinburgh during the Jacobite rising of 1745. At the end of the year, Robert fell seriously ill for some months, and it seems unlikely that he returned to university, having completed only two years of study.

On his recovery from illness in 1746, he joined his elder brother John as apprentice to his father. He assisted William Adam on projects such as the building of Inveraray Castle and the continuing extensions of Hopetoun House. William&#x27;s position as Master Mason to the Board of Ordnance also began to generate much work, as the Highlands were fortified following the failed Jacobite revolt. Robert&#x27;s early ambition was to be an artist rather than architect, and the style of his early sketches in the manner of Salvator Rosa are reflected in his earliest surviving architectural drawings, which show picturesque gothic follies. William Adam died in June 1748, and left Dowhill, a part of the Blair Adam estate which included Dowhill Castle, to Robert. From his father, Robert inherited an extensive library and extended it.

===Architectural practice in Edinburgh===
On William Adam&#x27;s death, John Adam inherited both the family business and the position of Master Mason to the Board of Ordnance. He immediately took Robert into partnership, later to be joined by James Adam. The Adam Brothers&#x27; first major commission was the decoration of the grand state apartments on the first floor at Hopetoun House, followed by their first &quot;new build&quot; at Dumfries House. For the Board of Ordnance, the brothers were the main contractor at Fort George, a large modern fort near Inverness designed by military engineer Colonel William Skinner. Visits to this project, begun in 1750, would occupy the brothers every summer for the next 10 years, and, along with works at many other barracks and forts, provided Robert with a solid foundation in practical building.

In the winter of 1749–1750, Adam travelled to London with his friend, the poet John Home. He took the opportunity for architectural study, visiting Wilton, designed by Inigo Jones, and the Queens Hermitage in Richmond by Roger Morris. His sketchbook of the trip also shows a continuing interest in Gothic architecture.

Among his friends at Edinburgh were the philosophers Adam Ferguson and David Hume and the artist Paul Sandby whom he met in the Highlands. Other Edinburgh acquaintances included Gilbert Elliot, William Wilkie, John Home and Alexander Wedderburn.

===Grand Tour===
On 3 October 1754, Robert Adam in the company of his brother James (who went as far as Brussels) set off from Edinburgh for his Grand Tour, stopping for a few days in London, where they visited the Mansion House, London, St Stephen Walbrook, St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Windsor, Berkshire, in the company of Thomas Sandby who showed them his landscaping at Windsor Great Park and Virginia Water Lake. They sailed from Dover arriving in Calais on 28 October 1754. He joined Charles Hope-Weir, brother of the Earl of Hopetoun in Brussels and together they travelled to Rome. Hope agreed to take Adam on the tour at the suggestion of his uncle, the Marquess of Annandale, who had undertaken the Grand Tour himself. While in Brussels the pair attended a Play and , as well as visiting churches and palaces in the city. Travelling on to Tournai, then Lille, where they visited the citadel designed by Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban. By 12 November 1754 Adam and Hope were in Paris where they took lodgings in Hotel de Notre Dame.

Adam and Hope travelled on to Italy together, before falling out in Rome over travelling expenses and accommodation. Robert Adam stayed on in Rome until 1757, studying classical architecture and honing his drawing skills. His tutors included the French architect and artist Charles-Louis Clérisseau, and the Italian artist Giovanni Battista Piranesi. Here, he became acquainted with the work of the pioneering classical archaeologist and art historian, theorist Johann Joachim Winckelmann. On his return journey, Adam and Clerisseau spent time intensively studying the ruins of Diocletian&#x27;s Palace at Spalatro in Dalmatia (now known as Split, in modern Croatia). These studies were later published as &quot;Ruins of the Palace of the Emperor Diocletian at Spalatro in Dalmatia&quot; in 1764.

===Architectural practice in London===
He returned to Britain in 1758 and set up in business in London with his brother James Adam. They focused on designing complete schemes for the decoration and furnishing of houses. Palladian design was popular, and Robert designed a number of country houses in this style, but he evolved a new, more flexible style incorporating elements of classical Roman design alongside influences from Greek, Byzantine and Baroque styles. The Adam brothers&#x27; success can also be attributed to a desire to design everything down to the smallest detail, ensuring a sense of unity in their design. In Adam interiors, all the furnishings were custom designed to accord with the decoration of the room in a unified harmony. Often the carpets were woven to match the intricate patterns of the ceiling above, while every fitting including sconces, mirrors, and doorknobs also received a custom design emulating the motifs of the room.
The Adam practice was not without mishap, however. In 1768 the brothers purchased a 99-year lease for a marshy plot of land beside the Thames in Westminster, where they built a 24-house terrace development known as the Adelphi. The project was very ambitious and is the first instance where terraced houses were designed individually to give unified harmony to the whole development (previously terraced houses were built to one replicated design, side-by-side around a square). However, the project became a white elephant for Robert and his brothers, with uncertain financing and costs spiralling out of control. The houses were built on a huge artificial terrace resting on vaulted substructures on the level of the Thames, which Robert Adam was certain could be leased to the British government as warehouses. However, this intention failed to materialize; the Adam brothers were left with huge debts and, in 1772, had to lay off 3,000 workmen and cease building. Robert Adam himself moved into one of the houses in the Adelphi, along with supportive friends like David Garrick and Josiah Wedgwood, who opened a showroom for his ceramics in one of the houses. In 1774, a public lottery authorised under the (13 Geo. 3. c. 75) was held to raise funds for the brothers, which allowed them to avert bankruptcy.

==Public life==
Adam was elected a fellow of the Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce in 1758 and of the Society of Antiquaries in 1761, the same year he was appointed Architect of the King&#x27;s Works (jointly with Sir William Chambers). His younger brother James succeeded him in this post when he relinquished the role in 1768 to devote more time to his elected office as member of Parliament for Kinross-shire.

==Architectural style==
Adam rejected the Palladian style, as introduced to England by Inigo Jones, and advocated by Lord Burlington, as &quot;ponderous&quot; and &quot;disgustful&quot;. However, he continued their tradition of drawing inspiration directly from classical antiquity, during his four-year stay in Europe. Adam developed a new style of architectural decoration, one which was more archaeologically accurate than past neoclassical styles, but nonetheless innovative and not bound only by ancient precedents. In &quot;Works in Architecture&quot;, co-authored by Robert and James, the brothers stated that Graeco-Roman examples should &quot;serve as models which we should imitate, and as standards by which we ought to judge.&quot; The discoveries being made in Herculaneum and Pompeii at the time provided ample material for Robert Adam to draw on for inspiration.

The Adam brothers&#x27; principle of &quot;movement&quot; was largely Robert&#x27;s conception, although the theory was first written down by James. &quot;Movement&quot; relied on dramatic contrasts and diversity of form, and drew on the picturesque aesthetic. The first volume of the Adam brothers&#x27; &quot;Works&quot; (1773) cited Kedleston Hall, designed by Robert in 1761, as an outstanding example of movement in architecture.

By contrasting room sizes and decorative schemes, Adam applied the concept of movement to his interiors also. His style of decoration, described by Pevsner as &quot;Classical Rococo&quot;, drew on Roman &quot;grotesque&quot; stucco decoration.

==Influence==
Adam&#x27;s work had influenced the direction of architecture and design across the western world. In England his collaboration with Thomas Chippendale resulted in some of the finest neoclassicist designs of the time, most notably in the Harewood House collection of Chippendale&#x27;s work. In North America, the Federal style owes much to neoclassicism as practised by Adam. In Europe, Adam notably influenced Charles Cameron, the Scotsman who designed apartments in the Catherine Palace, Tsarskoye Selo and other Russian palaces for Catherine the Great. However, by the time of his death, Adam&#x27;s neoclassicism was being superseded in Britain by a more severe, Greek phase of the classical revival, as practised by James &quot;Athenian&quot; Stuart. The Adam brothers employed several draughtsmen who would go on to establish themselves as architects, including George Richardson, and the Italian Joseph Bonomi, who Robert originally hired in Rome.

===Written works===
During their lifetime Robert and James Adam published two volumes of their designs, &quot;Works in Architecture of Robert and James Adam&quot; (in 1773–1778 and 1779; a third volume was published posthumously, in 1822).

==Death and burial==
Adam had long suffered from stomach and bowel problems, probably caused by a peptic ulcer and irritable bowel syndrome. While at home – 11 Albemarle Street, London – on 1 March 1792, one of the ulcers burst, and on 3 March Adam died.

The funeral was held on 10 March; he was buried in the south aisle of Westminster Abbey. The pall-bearers were several of his clients: Henry Scott, 3rd Duke of Buccleuch; George Coventry, 6th Earl of Coventry; James Maitland, 8th Earl of Lauderdale; David Murray, 2nd Earl of Mansfield; Lord Frederick Campbell and Sir William Pulteney, 5th Baronet.

Knowing he was dying, he drafted his will on 2 March 1792. Having never married, Adam left his estate to his sisters Elizabeth Adam and Margaret Adam.

His obituary appeared in the March 1792 edition of &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot;:
It is somewhat remarkable that the Arts should be deprived at the same time of two of their greatest ornaments, Sir Joshua Reynolds and Mr Adam: and it is difficult to say which of them excelled most in his particular profession... 
Mr Adam produced a total change in the architecture of this country: and his fertile genius in elegant ornament was not confined to the decoration of buildings, but has been diffused to every branch of manufacture. His talents extend beyond the lie of his own profession: he displayed in his numerous drawings in landscape a luxuriance of composition, and an effect of light and shadow, which have scarcely been equalled...to the last period of his life, Mr Adam displayed an increasing vigour of genius and refinement of taste: for in the space of one year preceding his death, he designed eight great public works, besides twenty five private buildings, so various in their style, and so beautiful in their composition, that they have been allowed by the best judges, sufficient of themselves, to establish his fame unrivalled as an artist.
He left nearly 9,000 drawings, 8,856 of which (by both Robert and James Adam) were subsequently purchased in 1833 for £200 by the architect John Soane and are now at the Soane Museum in London.

<text>Short-form content (also known as short-form videos) are short videos, often from movies or entertainment videos, that are published on platforms like YouTube Shorts, TikTok, and others.

Short-form content has become popular among young people, especially those of Generation Z and Alpha, shaping modern internet culture. Short-form content gained some popularity in the 2010s before becoming even more popular in the 2020s, especially with the creation of platforms such as TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, etc.

Most short-form content today is usually shown as a vertical video up to a few minutes long (3 minutes maximum for YouTube Shorts content ). They can contain snippets of videos taken out of context and made as memes. Sometimes short-form content can be used to attract the public to the user&#x27;s other accounts or their other long-form contents.

== History ==

Short videos became popular in the 2010s. Snapchat started allowing users to share 10-second videos in 2012. Vine, which was launched in 2013 and restricted videos to a maximum length of six seconds, helped short-form videos achieve mainstream popularity and gave rise to a new generation of public figures such as Kurtis Conner, David Dobrik, Danny Gonzalez, Drew Gooden, Liza Koshy, Shawn Mendes, Jake Paul, Logan Paul, and Lele Pons. Instagram responded to Vine&#x27;s popularity by adding the ability to share 15-second videos in 2013, and has since expanded its video functionality with numerous additional features, including Reels.

Following Vine&#x27;s closure in 2017, most of its notable users began making longer videos on YouTube. After TikTok merged with Musical.ly in 2018, TikTok became the most widely used short-form video app and has since become one of the world&#x27;s most popular apps. In 2020, Vine co-founder Dom Hofmann launched Vine&#x27;s intended successor Byte (later renamed Clash and then Huddles). In 2021, as a response to the ever-increasing competition presented by TikTok, YouTube launched YouTube Shorts to host videos up to a maximum length of 60 seconds, later extending it to 3 minutes in 2024. YouTube Shorts collectively earned over 5 trillion views within 6 months.

<doc id="113586" wikidata="Q165230" url="?curid=113586" title="Flag of the Soviet Union">
<text>The State Flag of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, also simply known as the Soviet flag or the Red Banner, was a red flag with two communist symbols displayed in the canton: a gold hammer and sickle topped off by a red five-point star bordered in gold. The flag&#x27;s design and symbolism are derived from several sources, but emerged during the Russian Revolution. It has also come to serve as the standard symbol representing communism as a whole, recognized as such in international circles, even after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.

The plain red flag, which was a traditional revolutionary symbol long before 1917, was incorporated into the Soviet flag to pay tribute to the international aspect of the workers&#x27; revolution. On the other hand, the unique hammer-and-sickle design was a modern industrial touch adopted from the Russian Revolution; it represented the &quot;victorious and enduring revolutionary alliance&quot; by unifying the hammer (i.e. workers) and the sickle (i.e. peasants). The gold-bordered five-point star situated above the hammer and sickle was a representation of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

The first flag was adopted in December 1922. In 1923, 1924, 1936, and in 1955, statutes were adopted that resulted in adjustments to the hammer&#x27;s handle length and the sickle&#x27;s shape. In 1980, an amendment was made to the 1955 decree that removed the hammer and sickle displayed on the flag&#x27;s reverse side, though the legal description remained completely unchanged. The design of the 1955 Soviet flag served as the basis for all of the flags of the Union Republics.

==Symbolism and design==
The flag of the Soviet Union consisted of a plain red flag with a gold hammer crossed with a gold sickle placed beneath a gold-bordered red star. This symbol is in the upper left canton of the red flag.

The colour red honours the red flag of the Paris Commune of 1871; the red star and the hammer and sickle are symbols of communism and socialism.

The hammer symbolises urban industrial workers while the sickle symbolises agricultural workers (peasants), who form the state together with the proletarian class. The red star represents the Communist Party, and its position over the hammer and sickle symbolises its leading role in socialist society to unify and enlighten the workers and peasants in the building of a communist society.

The flag&#x27;s design was legislated in 1955, which gave a clear way to define and create the flag. This resulted in a change of the hammer&#x27;s handle length and the shape of the sickle. The adopted statute stated that:
#The ratio of width to length of the flag is 1:2.
#The hammer and sickle are in a square with sides equal to of the flag&#x27;s height. The sharp tip of the sickle lies in the center of the upper side of the square, and the handles of the hammer and sickle rest in the bottom corners of the square. The length of the hammer and its handle is of the square diagonal.
#The five-pointed star is inscribed into a circle with a diameter of of the flag&#x27;s height, the circle being tangent to the upper side of the square.
#The distance of the vertical axis of the star, hammer and sickle from the hoist is of the flag&#x27;s height. The distance from the upper side of the flag to the center of the star is of the flag&#x27;s height.

Officially since 1980, the reverse side of the flag was a plain red field without the hammer and sickle. In practice, however, this was very commonly disregarded by flag makers as it was far easier and less costly to simply print the flag through and through, with the obverse design mirrored on the reverse. It was also common to see the reverse of the flag bear the hammer and sickle in the obverse formation. An example of the flag demonstrating its &quot;de jure&quot; status as being only one-sided is that of the Soviet flag atop the Moscow Kremlin which bore the single-side official design.

For vertical display, the flag was made with the distinct difference of having the hammer and sickle rotated 90 degrees in order to compensate for the change in dimensions. Although common in official practice, a typical flag owner would simply turn a standard design flag 90 degrees to the right and hang it by the hoist (not flipped like in the US flag).

==History==
During the establishment of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, Vladimir Lenin and his followers had considered the inclusion of a sword symbol in addition to the hammer and sickle as part of the state seal on which the flag was eventually based. The idea was dismissed as too visually aggressive, with Lenin apparently affirming, &quot;A sword is not one of our symbols.&quot;

The first official flag was adopted in December 1922 at the First Congress of Soviets of the USSR. It was agreed that the red banner &quot;was transformed from the symbol of the Party to the symbol of a state, and around that flag gathered the peoples of the soviet republics to unite into one state — the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics&quot;. On 30 December 1922, the Congress adopted a Declaration and Agreement on the establishment of the USSR. Article 22 of the Agreement states: &quot;The USSR has a flag, coat of arms and a state seal.&quot; The description of the first flag was given in the 1924 Soviet Constitution, accepted in the second session of the executive committee (CIK) of the USSR on 6 July 1923. The text of Article 71 states: &quot;The state flag of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics consists of a red or scarlet field with the state&#x27;s coat of arms.&quot; It was ordered with the unusual ratio of 4:1 in proportion and consisted of a red flag with the state coat of arms in the center. However, such a flag was never mass-produced. This flag was the official flag for four months, and was replaced as the official flag by the more familiar hammer and sickle design during the third session of the CIK of the USSR on 12 November 1923.

In the third session of the CIK of the USSR, the description of Soviet flag in the Constitution was changed, and article 71 was edited to read: &quot;The state flag of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics consists of a red or scarlet field, and in the canton a golden sickle and hammer, and a red five-pointed star bordered in gold above them. The ratio of width to length is 1:2.&quot; On 19 August 1955, the Statute on the State Flag of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was adopted by a decision of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. This resulted in a change of the hammer&#x27;s handle length and the shape of the sickle. On 15 August 1980, a new edition of the Statute on the State Flag of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics was adopted, which did not make any changes to the flag&#x27;s description aside from removing the hammer and sickle on the reverse side of the flag. From this point on, the flag stayed in use with this design until the disintegration of the USSR on 26 December 1991, at which time it ceased to be a national flag and replaced by national flags of the post-Soviet republics.

On 15 April 1996, Boris Yeltsin signed a presidential decree giving the Soviet flag (called the Victory Banner, after the banner that was raised above the Reichstag on 1 May 1945) status similar to that of the national flag. The hammer and sickle were removed from the flag, leaving only the star, but they were reinstated later. On certain holidays, the Victory Banner is flown along with the Russian flag.

=== Contemporary usage ===
In current times, the Soviet national flag (and similar flags) are widely used by those on the political far left, most often by those who support Marxism–Leninism, although the earlier (pre-Stalinist) flags are occasionally used by Trotskyists and those on the modern communist left.

The Soviet flag is also actively promoted in Russia as a symbol of nostalgia for the Soviet Union. Various politicians frequently utilize it as a symbol of the superpower status Russia lost in 1991.

Amidst the backdrop of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Communist Party of the Russian Federation proposed to the State Duma the adoption of the Soviet flag as the official flag of Russia on 19 April 2022. The use of Soviet symbols including its flag became very extensive by invading Russian forces over the course of the war along with the letter &quot;Z&quot;.

On 17 June 2023, during the celebration for the 300th anniversary of Saint Petersburg, the respective flags of the Russian Empire (), Soviet Union, and Russian Federation were raised simultaneously at the Gulf of Finland.

<text>The penultimate USSR-era flag was adopted by the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) in 1954 and used until 1991. The flag of the Russian SFSR was a defacement of the flag of the USSR. The constitution stipulated:

The symbol of the hammer and sickle represented the working class; more specifically, the hammer represented the urban industrial workers and the sickle represented the rural and agricultural peasants. The red star represented the Communist Party and Communism. The red of the flag represented revolution in general and the Russian Revolution in particular. The blue stripe symbolized the wide Russian skies and the waters of its seas and rivers.

==History==
The first flag of the Russian SFSR, adopted on 14 April 1918, was a flag showing the full name of the recently created Soviet republic before the then imminent Russian spelling reform. Its ratio was unspecified.

From June 1918, the flag was red with the gold Cyrillic characters РСФСР (&quot;RSFSR&quot;) in the top-left corner, in a traditional Vyaz&#x27; style of ornamental Cyrillic calligraphy.

From 1920, the characters were redesigned as described by the Russian Constitution of 1925. However, this flag was oftentimes not used, with the 1918 flag being used until 1937.


In February 1947, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR issued a resolution urging the Soviet republics to adopt new flags. The design was suggested to be based on the state flag of the USSR, as to indicate the idea of the republic within the union, and to include colors and national ornaments to express the geographical, national, historical and cultural characteristics of each republic. In the Russian SFSR, the chairman of the Secretary of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet opened the first meeting the next month to redesign the national flag.

On 9 January 1954, the new national flag of the RSFSR was approved by the Decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR. The flag was designed by artist Valentin Petrovich Viktorov. On 2 June 1954, the description of the flag was included in the Constitution of the RSFSR.

After the attempted coup of 1991, Boris Yeltsin, the president of the Russian SFSR adopted a resolution that the imperial tricolor flag of the Russian Empire would be the flag of RSFSR. On 22 August 1991 the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR decided:

It was first hoisted at 12:00 pm on 22 August 1991 at the White House. A tricolor with the hammer and sickle on the centre was also later proposed.

On 1 November 1991, the Constitution of the RSFSR was amended to adopt the white-azure-scarlet flag as the official national flag.

=== Proposed flag of the Russian SFSR ===

Since the first meeting for creating new national flag of the RFSFR in March 1947, some proposals were sent to the authority. The graphic artist create a proposal to add white and blue horizontal stripes at the bottom, both two stripes took of the flag&#x27;s height. His proposal was submitted to the Secretary of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR Alexander Gorkin in June 1948 and again to the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the RSFSR Boris Chernousov in December 1949, but was not approved.

Mikhail Rodionov also created another proposal for the state flag of the RSFSR. It consisted of a traditional tricolour flag and a hammer and a sickle in the middle of the flag. Because of his proposal, he was accused of nationalism and anti-Sovietism in 1950, at the Leningrad affair case.

==Other Russian SFSR flags==
The banner of the republic was a 1:1 ratio red flag with gold fringe, commonly used in ceremonies. The banner was also used for the first inauguration of Boris Yeltsin as President of the Russian SFSR on 10 July 1991.

==Colour scheme==

==Regional flags based on the flag of RSFSR==
===Flags of the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics===
Flags of the Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republics of RSFSR were defacements of the 1954 flag of RSFSR, with texts or acronyms of the name of the republic in official languages.

<doc id="113595" wikidata="Q273138" url="?curid=113595" title="International Council on Monuments and Sites">
<text>The International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS; ) is a professional association that works for the conservation and protection of cultural heritage places around the world. Now headquartered in Charenton-le-Pont, France, ICOMOS was founded in 1965 in Warsaw as a result of the Venice Charter of 1964 and offers advice to UNESCO on World Heritage Sites.

The idea behind ICOMOS dates to the Athens Conference on the restoration of historic buildings in 1931, organized by the International Museums Office. The Athens Charter of 1931 introduced the concept of international heritage. In 1964, the Second Congress of Architects and Specialists of Historic Buildings, meeting in Venice, adopted 13 resolutions. The first created the International Charter on the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments and Sites, better known as Venice Charter; the second, put forward by UNESCO, created ICOMOS to carry out this charter.

ICOMOS currently has over 10,100 individual members in 153 countries, 110 national committees, and 28 international scientific committees. With rare exceptions, each member must be qualified in the field of conservation and a practicing landscape architect, architect, archaeologist, anthropologist, town planner, engineer, administrator of heritage, historian, art historian, palaeontologist or archivist.

ICOMOS is a partner and founding member of the Blue Shield, which works to protect the world&#x27;s cultural heritage threatened by war and natural disasters.

==ICOMOS structure==
ICOMOS is composed of its national committees (NCs), to which individuals and institutions apply for membership. In addition to the national committees, ICOMOS has a series of international scientific committees (ISCs), in which experts in a certain field of activity within the context of heritage conservation exchange views and debate.

The organization is headed by a president, five vice-presidents, a secretary-general and a treasurer all directly elected by the general assembly of the organization. 12 additional members are also elected by the General Assembly into the Executive Committee and five further members are co-opted into the executive board in order to represent regions of the world or areas of expertise that were not part of the executive committee following the elections. &quot;Ex officio&quot; members of the executive committee are the president of the advisory committee and the previous presidents of ICOMOS, who attend in advisory capacity. The executive committee is the executive body of ICOMOS.

The advisory committee is composed of the chairpersons of the national committees, the chairpersons of the international scientific committees and the president of ICOMOS as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member. The advisory committee was given the task to advise and make recommendations to the General Assembly and the Executive Committee on matters which concern policy and programme priorities.

===National committees===
National committees are subsidiary organizations created in the countries which are members of UNESCO. They bring together individual and institutional members and offer them a framework for discussion and an exchange of information. Each national committee adopts its own rules of procedure and elaborates its own program according to the goals and aims of ICOMOS. In 2021, ICOMOS has 107 national committees. ICOMOS website includes a list regularly updated.

===International scientific committees===
International scientific committees (ISCs) are entities focus on specialised areas of heritage conservation and are made up of members of the organisation drawn from those specialist areas. The scientific programmes of the organisation are coordinated by the &quot;scientific council&quot; made up of the presidents of the ISCs. Nowadays, ICOMOS has 28 ISCs. A list regularly updated is available on ICOMOS website.

=== Working groups ===
ICOMOS conducts a process of reflection on doctrine and good practice on current issues involving the conservation of cultural heritage. To this end, it sets up working groups made up of ICOMOS members who are heritage professionals: architects, archaeologists, professors and researchers, curators and scientists. The aim of these groups can be the drafting of a charter, the implementation of concrete activities (working sessions, workshops). There are currently 6 working groups, the list of which can be found on the ICOMOS website, in which experts reflect on a wide variety of subjects related to heritage conservation: indigenous heritage, sustainable development, Syria/Iraq, climate change and emerging professionals.

== ICOMOS International Secretariat ==
=== Documentation Center ===
Located at ICOMOS headquarters in Paris, it collects, analyses and disseminates information on all methods of heritage conservation, notably through its bibliographic database (14,000 references on the world&#x27;s architectural heritage) and a large photo library containing more than 8,000 photographs. It is open for consultation to researchers, whether or not they are members of ICOMOS.

=== Publications ===
The regular publications of ICOMOS International are: ICOMOS News, a newsletter for members, which provides an update on the activities of the association (quarterly in French, English and Spanish); the ICOMOS Scientific Journal, published twice a year, is a thematic journal ;

The regular publications of the French Section of ICOMOS are: Le &quot;Bulletin d’information d’Icomos France&quot;; &quot;Les Cahiers de la Section Française de l’ICOMOS&quot; ; &quot;Les Dossiers techniques&quot; ; &quot;Les Mémentos techniques&quot; ; &quot;les Bulletins&quot; (dossiers des colloques); &quot;Les Enquêtes de la section française&quot;.

==ICOMOS charters and doctrinal texts==
In the tradition of the Athens and Venice Charters, ICOMOS has, in the years since its formation, developed and adopted a number of other charters and doctrinal texts which provide guidance to heritage conservation professionals in their work. Most such documents are created by the international committees of the organisation and thereafter adopted by the triennial General Assembly. The texts each address a specific area of professional practice in the heritage conservation professions. Following the 17th ICOMOS General Assembly held in Paris in November 2011, the list of charters is as follows:

* International Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments and Sites (Venice Charter), 1964
*Historic Gardens (Florence Charter), 1981
* Charter for the Conservation of Historic Towns and Urban Areas (Washington Charter), 1987
* Charter for the Protection and Management of Archaeological Heritage, 1990
* Charter on the Protection and Management of Underwater Cultural Heritage, 1996
* International Cultural Tourism Charter – Managing Tourism at Places of Heritage Significance, 1999
* Principles for the Preservation of Timber Structures, 1999
* Charter on the Built Vernacular Heritage, 1999
* ICOMOS Charter – Principles for the Analysis, Conservation and Structural Restoration of Architectural Heritage, 2003
* ICOMOS Principles for the Preservation and Conservation-Restoration of Wall Paintings, 2003
* ICOMOS Charter on Cultural Routes, 2008 
* ICOMOS Charter for the Interpretation and Presentation of Cultural Heritage Sites (also known as the &#x27;Ename Charter&#x27;), 2008
* Joint ICOMOS – TICCIH Principles for the Conservation of Industrial Heritage Sites, Structures, Areas and Landscapes, 2011
* The Valletta Principles for the Safeguarding and Management of Historic Cities, Towns and Urban Areas, 2011 (Supersedes the Washington Charter)
* ICOMOS-IFLA principles concerning rural landscapes as heritage, 2017
* Document on historic urban public parks, 2017
* Salalah guidelines for the management of public archaeological sites, 2017
* Principles for the conservation of wooden built heritage, 2017

In addition to the above there is a list of seventeen other doctrinal texts, resolutions and declarations, including the Nara Document on Authenticity. In November 1994, at the Nara Conference on Authenticity, ICOMOS published the Nara Document on Authenticity, which addresses the need for a broader understanding of cultural diversity and cultural heritage in conservation efforts involving cultural heritage sites.

Many of the national committees of ICOMOS have adopted their own charters which set standards for heritage conservation practice at national level.

==ICOMOS and the World Heritage Convention==
In 1972, ICOMOS was named by the UNESCO World Heritage Convention as one of the three formal advisory bodies to the World Heritage Committee, along with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property (ICCROM). As the professional and scientific adviser to the committee on all aspects of the cultural heritage, ICOMOS is responsible for the evaluation of all nominations of cultural properties made to the World Heritage List with the criteria laid down by the World Heritage Committee. In addition to the basic criterion of “outstanding universal value,” ICOMOS evaluates nominations for aspects related to authenticity, management, and conservation as specified in the World Heritage Convention.

The evaluation of nominations involves consultation between the wide-ranging expertise represented by the organization’s membership and its national and scientific committees. Members are also sent on expert missions to carry out on-site evaluations of nominated properties. This extensive consultation results in the preparation of detailed recommendations that are submitted to the World Heritage Committee at its annual meetings.

ICOMOS is also involved, through its International Secretariat and its national and scientific committees, in the preparation of reports on the state of conservation of properties inscribed on the World Heritage List. It advises the UNESCO World Heritage Centre on requests for technical assistance received from states that are party to (i.e. have ratified) the World Heritage Convention. ICOMOS maintains a full archive of nominations and reports at the documentation centre at its Paris headquarters.

== Piero Gazzola award ==
The Gazzola Prize was established in 1979 in memory of Piero Gazzola, one of the greatest defenders of the conservation and restoration of historic monuments and sites, and a founder of ICOMOS. The prize is awarded every three years at the General Assembly of ICOMOS to an individual or a group of people who have worked together and contributed with distinction to the aims and objectives of ICOMOS. The beneficiary must be a member of ICOMOS and is chosen by the Selection Committee itself elected by the ICOMOS Board. The Prize is a commemorative medal and diploma.

<text>E.C. Publications, Inc., (doing business as EC Comics) is an American comic book publisher. It specialized in horror fiction, crime fiction, satire, military fiction, dark fantasy, and science fiction from the 1940s through the mid-1950s, notably the &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; series. Initially, EC was founded as Educational Comics by Maxwell Gaines and specialized in educational and child-oriented stories. After Max Gaines died in a boating accident in 1947, his son William Gaines took over the company and renamed it Entertaining Comics. He printed more mature stories, delving into horror, war, fantasy, science-fiction, adventure, and other genres. Noted for their high quality and shock endings, these stories were also unique in their socially conscious, progressive themes (including racial equality, anti-war advocacy, nuclear disarmament, and environmentalism) that anticipated the Civil Rights Movement and the dawn of the 1960s counterculture. In 1954–55, censorship pressures prompted it to concentrate on the humor magazine &quot;Mad&quot;, leading to the company&#x27;s greatest and most enduring success. Consequently, by 1956, the company ceased publishing all its comic lines except &quot;Mad&quot;.

==History==

=== 1944–1950: Founding of publisher as Educational Comics ===

The firm, first known as Educational Comics, was founded by Max Gaines, former editor of the comic-book company All-American Publications, and it was initially a shell company of All-American. When that company merged with DC Comics in June 1945, Gaines retained rights to the comic book &quot;Picture Stories from the Bible&quot;, and began his new company using the EC name with a plan to market comics about science, history, and the Bible to schools and churches, and soon expanded to produce children&#x27;s humor titles. A decade earlier, Max Gaines had been one of the pioneers of the comic book form, with Eastern Color Printing&#x27;s proto-comic book &quot;Funnies on Parade&quot;, and with Dell Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Famous Funnies: A Carnival of Comics&quot;, considered by historians the first true American comic book.

=== 1950–1955: Rebranded as Entertaining Comics, introduction to &quot;New Trend&quot; ===
When Max Gaines died in 1947 in a boating accident, his son William inherited the comics company. After four years (1942–1946) in the Army Air Corps, Gaines had returned home to finish school at New York University, planning to work as a chemistry teacher. He never taught but instead took over the family business. In 1949 and 1950, Bill Gaines began a line of new titles featuring horror, suspense, science fiction, military fiction and crime fiction. His editors, Al Feldstein and Harvey Kurtzman, who also drew covers and stories, gave assignments to such prominent and highly accomplished freelance artists as Johnny Craig, Reed Crandall, Jack Davis, Will Elder, George Evans, Frank Frazetta, Graham Ingels, Jack Kamen, Bernard Krigstein, Joe Orlando, John Severin, Al Williamson, Basil Wolverton, and Wally Wood. With input from Gaines, the stories were written by Kurtzman, Feldstein, and Craig. Other writers, including Carl Wessler, Jack Oleck, and Otto Binder, were later brought on board.

EC succeeded with its fresh approach and pioneered forming relationships with its readers through its letters to the editor and fan organization, the National EC Fan-Addict Club. EC Comics promoted its stable of illustrators, allowing each to sign his art and encouraging them to develop distinctive styles; the company published one-page biographies of them in comic books. This was in contrast to the industry&#x27;s common practice, in which credits were often missing, although some artists at other companies, such as the Jack Kirby – Joe Simon team, Jack Cole and Bob Kane had been prominently promoted.

EC published distinct lines of titles under its Entertaining Comics umbrella. Most notorious were its horror books, &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;, &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot;, and &quot;The Haunt of Fear&quot;. These titles reveled in a gruesome &quot;joie de vivre&quot;, with grimly ironic fates meted out to many of the stories&#x27; protagonists. The company&#x27;s war comics, &quot;Frontline Combat&quot; and &quot;Two-Fisted Tales&quot;, often featured weary-eyed, unheroic stories out of step with the jingoistic times. &quot;Shock SuspenStories&quot; tackled weighty political and social issues such as racism, sex, drug use, and the American way of life. EC always claimed to be &quot;proudest of our science fiction titles&quot;, with &quot;Weird Science&quot; and &quot;Weird Fantasy&quot; publishing stories unlike the space opera found in such titles as Fiction House&#x27;s &quot;Planet Comics&quot;. &quot;Crime SuspenStories&quot; had many parallels with &quot;film noir&quot;. As noted by Max Allan Collins in his story annotations for Russ Cochran&#x27;s 1983 hardcover reprint of &quot;Crime SuspenStories&quot;, Johnny Craig had developed a &quot;&quot;film noir&quot;-ish bag of effects&quot; in his visuals, while characters and themes found in the crime stories often showed the strong influence of writers associated with &quot;film noir&quot;, notably James M. Cain. Craig excelled in drawing stories of domestic scheming and conflict, leading David Hajdu to observe:
Superior illustrations of stories with surprise endings became EC&#x27;s trademark. Gaines would generally stay up late and read large amounts of material while seeking &quot;springboards&quot; for story concepts. The next day he would present each premise until Feldstein found one that he thought he could develop into a story. At EC&#x27;s peak, Feldstein edited seven titles while Kurtzman handled three. Artists were assigned stories specific to their styles; for example, Davis and Ingels often drew gruesome, supernatural-themed stories, while Kamen and Evans did tamer material.

With hundreds of stories written, common themes surfaced. Some of EC&#x27;s more well-known themes include:
* An ordinary situation given an ironic and gruesome twist, often as poetic justice for a character&#x27;s crimes. In &quot;Collection Completed&quot;, a man takes up taxidermy to annoy his wife. When he kills and stuffs her beloved cat, the wife snaps and kills him, stuffing and mounting his body. In &quot;Revulsion&quot;, a spaceship pilot is bothered by insects due to an experience when he found one in his food. After the story, a giant alien insect screams in horror at finding the dead pilot in his salad. Dissection, the boiling of lobsters, Mexican jumping beans, fur coats, and fishing are just a small sample of the kind of situations and objects used in this fashion.
* The &quot;Grim Fairy Tale&quot;, featuring gruesome interpretations of such fairy tales as &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot;, &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, and &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;.
* Siamese twins were a popular theme, primarily in EC&#x27;s three horror comics. No fewer than nine Siamese twin stories appeared in EC&#x27;s horror and crime comics from 1950 to 1954. In an interview, Feldstein speculated that he and Gaines wrote so many Siamese twin stories because of the interdependence they had on each other.
* Adaptations of Ray Bradbury science-fiction stories appeared in two dozen EC comics starting in 1952. It began inauspiciously, with an incident in which Feldstein and Gaines plagiarized two of Bradbury&#x27;s stories and combined them into a single tale. Learning of the story, Bradbury sent a note praising them, while remarking that he had &quot;inadvertently&quot; not yet received his payment for their use. EC sent a check and negotiated a productive series of Bradbury adaptations.
* Stories with a political message, which became common in EC&#x27;s science fiction and suspense comics. Among the many topics were lynching, antisemitism, and police corruption.

The three horror titles featured stories introduced by a trio of horror hosts: The Crypt Keeper introduced &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;; The Vault-Keeper welcomed readers to &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot;; and the Old Witch cackled over &quot;The Haunt of Fear&quot;. Besides gleefully recounting the unpleasant details of the stories, the characters squabbled with one another, unleashed an arsenal of puns, and even insulted and taunted the readers: &quot;Greetings, boils and ghouls...&quot; This irreverent mockery of the audience also became the trademark attitude of &quot;Mad&quot;, and such glib give-and-take was later mimicked by many, including Stan Lee at Marvel Comics.

EC&#x27;s most enduring legacy came with &quot;Mad&quot;, which started as a side project for Kurtzman before buoying the company&#x27;s fortunes and becoming one of the country&#x27;s most notable and long-running humor publications. When satire became an industry rage in 1954, and other publishers created imitations of &quot;Mad&quot;, EC introduced a sister title, &quot;Panic&quot;, edited by Al Feldstein and using the regular &quot;Mad&quot; artists plus Joe Orlando.

===1955–1956: &quot;New Direction&quot; and &quot;Picto-Fiction&quot;===
EC shifted its focus to a line of more realistic comic book titles, including &quot;M.D.&quot; and &quot;Psychoanalysis&quot; (known as the New Direction line). It also renamed its remaining science-fiction comic. Since the initial issues did not carry the Comics Code seal, the wholesalers refused to carry them. After consulting with his staff, Gaines reluctantly started submitting his comics to the Comics Code; all the New Direction titles carried the seal starting with the second issue. This attempted revamp failed commercially and after the fifth issue, all the New Direction titles were canceled. &quot;Incredible Science Fiction&quot; #33 was the last EC comic book published.

Gaines switched focus to EC&#x27;s Picto-Fiction titles, a line of typeset black-and-white magazines with heavily illustrated stories. Fiction was formatted to alternate illustrations with blocks of typeset text, and some of the contents were rewrites of stories previously published in EC&#x27;s comic books. This experimental line lost money from the start and only lasted two issues per title. When EC&#x27;s national distributor went bankrupt, Gaines dropped all of his titles except &quot;Mad&quot;.

=== 1960–1989: Acquisition from Kinney National Company, focus towards &quot;MAD&quot; and other licensing ===

&quot;Mad&quot; sold well throughout the company&#x27;s troubles, and Gaines focused exclusively on publishing it in magazine form. This move was to reconcile its editor Harvey Kurtzman, who had received an offer to join the magazine &quot;Pageant&quot;, but preferred to remain in charge of his magazine. The switch also removed &quot;Mad&quot; from the auspices of the Comics Code. Kurtzman, regardless, left &quot;Mad&quot; soon afterward when Gaines would not give him 51 percent control of the magazine, and Gaines brought back Al Feldstein as Kurtzman&#x27;s successor. The magazine enjoyed great success for decades afterward.

Gaines sold the company in the 1960s as E.C. Publications, Inc., and was eventually absorbed into the same corporation that later purchased National Periodical Publications (later known as DC Comics). 

During the 1960s, Gaines granted Bob Barrett, Roger Hill, and Jerry Norton Weist (1949–2011), the co-founder of Million Year Picnic, permission to produce a EC Comics fanzine &quot;Squa Tront&quot; (1967 - 1983) that would last for several years. In June 1967, Kinney National Company (it formed on August 12, 1966, after Kinney Parking/National Cleaning merge) bought National Periodical and E.C., then it purchased Warner Bros.-Seven Arts in early 1969. Due to a financial scandal involving price fixing in its parking operations, Kinney Services spun off its non-entertainment assets as National Kinney Corporation in September 1971, and it changed names to Warner Communications on February 10, 1972.

The &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; title was licensed for a movie of that name in 1972. This was followed by another film, &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot;, in 1973. The omnibus movies &quot;Creepshow&quot; (1982) and &quot;Creepshow 2&quot;, while using original scripts written by Stephen King and George A. Romero, were inspired by EC&#x27;s horror comics. &quot;Creepshow 2&quot; included animated interstitial material between vignettes, featuring a young protagonist who goes to great length to acquire and keep possession of an issue of the comic book &quot;Creepshow&quot;.

In 1989, &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; began airing on the U.S. cable-TV network HBO. The series ran through 1996, comprising 93 episodes and seven seasons. &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; spawned two children&#x27;s television series on broadcast TV, &quot;Tales from the Cryptkeeper&quot; and &quot;Secrets of the Cryptkeeper&#x27;s Haunted House&quot;. It also spawned three &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;-branded movies, &quot;Demon Knight&quot;, &quot;Bordello of Blood&quot;, and &quot;Ritual&quot;. In 1997, HBO followed the TV series with the similar &quot;Perversions of Science&quot; (comprising 10 episodes), the episodes of which were based on stories from EC&#x27;s &quot;Weird Science&quot;.

===1973–2024: Focus on reprints===
Although the last non-&quot;Mad&quot; EC publication came out in 1956, EC Comics have remained popular for half a century, due to reprints that have kept them in the public eye. In 1964–1966, Ballantine Books published five black-and-white paperbacks of EC stories: &quot;Tales of the Incredible&quot; showcased EC science fiction, while the paperbacks &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; and &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot; reprinted EC horror tales. EC&#x27;s Ray Bradbury adaptations were collected in &quot;The Autumn People&quot; (horror and crime) and &quot;Tomorrow Midnight&quot; (science fiction).

&quot;The EC Horror Library&quot; (Nostalgia Press, 1971) featured 23 EC stories selected by Bhob Stewart and Bill Gaines, with an introduction by Stewart and an essay by theater critic Larry Stark. One of the first books to reprint comic book stories in color throughout, it followed the original color guides by Marie Severin. In addition to the stories from EC&#x27;s horror titles, the book also included Bernard Krigstein&#x27;s famous &quot;Master Race&quot; story from &quot;Impact&quot; and the first publication of Angelo Torres&#x27; &quot;An Eye for an Eye&quot;, originally slated for the final issue of &quot;Incredible Science Fiction&quot; but rejected by the Comics Code.

East Coast Comix reprinted several of EC&#x27;s New Trend comics in comic form between 1973 and 1975. The first reprint was the final issue of &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot;, with the title revised to state &quot;The Crypt of Terror&quot;. This issue was originally meant to be the first issue of a fourth horror comic which was changed to the final issue of &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; at the last minute when the horror comics were cancelled in 1954. A dozen issues ended up being reprinted.

Russ Cochran reprints include &quot;EC Portfolios&quot;, &quot;The Complete EC Library&quot;, &quot;EC Classics&quot;, &quot;RCP Reprints&quot; (Russ Cochran), &quot;EC Annuals&quot;, and &quot;EC Archives&quot; (hardcover books). The EC full-color hardcovers were under the 
Gemstone imprint. Dark Horse continued this series in the same format.

In February 2010, IDW Publishing began publishing a series of Artist&#x27;s Editions books in 15&quot; × 22&quot; format, which consist of scans of the original inked comic book art, including pasted lettering and other editorial artifacts that remain on the original pages. Subsequent EC books in the series included a collection of Wally Wood&#x27;s EC comic stories, a collection of stories from &quot;Mad&quot;, and books collecting the work of Jack Davis and Graham Ingels.

In 2012, Fantagraphics Books began a reprint series called &quot;The EC Artists&#x27; Library&quot; featuring the comics published by EC, releasing each book by artist. This collection is printed in black and white.

In 2013, Dark Horse Comics began reprinting the EC Archives in hardcover volumes, picking up where Gemstone left off, and using the same hardcover full-color format. The first volume to be reprinted was &quot;Tales From the Crypt: Volume 4&quot;, with an essay by Cochran.

===2024–present: Return to comics===
In February 2024, Oni Press announced that it will revive the brand, starting with horror title &quot;Epitaphs from the Abyss&quot; and the science fiction title &quot;Cruel Universe&quot;. 

The Gaines family licenses the titles.

== Criticisms and controversies ==
Beginning in the late 1940s, the comic book industry became the target of mounting public criticism for the content of comic books and their potentially harmful effects on children. The problem came to a head in 1948 with the publication by Dr. Fredric Wertham of two articles: &quot;Horror in the Nursery&quot; (in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;) and &quot;The Psychopathology of Comic Books&quot; (in the &quot;American Journal of Psychotherapy&quot;). As a result, an industry trade group, the Association of Comics Magazine Publishers, was formed in 1948 but proved ineffective. EC left the association in 1950 after Gaines argued with its executive director, Henry Schultz. By 1954 only three comic publishers were still members, and Schultz admitted that the ACMP seals placed on comics were meaningless.

In 1954, the publication of Wertham&#x27;s &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot; and a highly publicized Congressional hearing on juvenile delinquency cast comic books in an especially poor light. At the same time, a federal investigation led to a shakeup in the distribution companies that delivered comic books and pulp magazines across America. Sales plummeted, and several companies went out of business.

Gaines called a meeting of his fellow publishers and suggested that the comic book industry gather to fight outside censorship and help repair the industry&#x27;s damaged reputation. They formed the Comics Magazine Association of America and its Comics Code Authority. The CCA code expanded on the ACMP&#x27;s restrictions. Unlike its predecessor, the CCA code was rigorously enforced, with all comics requiring code approval before their publication. This not being what Gaines intended, he refused to join the association. Among the Code&#x27;s new rules were that no comic book title could use the words &quot;horror&quot; or &quot;terror&quot; on its cover. When distributors refused to handle many of his comics, Gaines ended publication of his three horror and the two &quot;SuspenStory&quot; titles on September 14, 1954.

=== &quot;Judgment Day&quot; ===

Gaines waged several battles with the Comics Code Authority to keep his magazines free from censorship. In one particular example noted by comics historian Digby Diehl, Gaines threatened Judge Charles Murphy, the Comics Code Administrator, with a lawsuit when Murphy ordered EC to alter the science-fiction story &quot;Judgment Day&quot;, in &quot;Incredible Science Fiction&quot; #33 (February 1956). The story, by the writer Al Feldstein and artist Joe Orlando, was a reprint from the pre-Code &quot;Weird Fantasy&quot; #18 (April 1953), inserted when the Code Authority had rejected an initial, original story, &quot;An Eye for an Eye&quot;, drawn by Angelo Torres, but was itself also &quot;objected to&quot; because of &quot;the central character being Black&quot;.

The story depicted a human astronaut, a representative of the Galactic Republic, visiting the planet Cybrinia, inhabited by robots. He finds the robots divided into functionally identical orange and blue races, with one having fewer rights and privileges than the other. The astronaut determines that due to the robots&#x27; bigotry, the Galactic Republic should not admit the planet until these problems are resolved. In the final panel, he removes his helmet, revealing he is a Black man. Murphy demanded, without any authority in the Code, that the Black astronaut had to be removed.

As Diehl recounted in &quot;Tales from the Crypt: The Official Archives&quot;:

Feldstein, interviewed for the book &quot;Tales of Terror: The EC Companion&quot;, reiterated his recollection of Murphy making the request:

<text>Basingwerk Abbey () is a Grade I listed ruined abbey near Holywell, Flintshire, Wales. The abbey, which was founded in the 12th century, belonged to the Order of Cistercians. It maintained significant lands in the English county of Derbyshire. The abbey was abandoned and its assets sold following the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1536.

The site is now managed by Cadw – the national Welsh heritage agency.

==Medieval history==

The abbey was founded in 1132 by Ranulf de Gernon, 4th Earl of Chester, who had already brought Benedictine monks from Savigny Abbey in southern Normandy. Likely the first location of the abbey was not at the current location at Greenfields but at the nearby Hen Blas. The abbey became part of the Cistercian Order in 1147, when the Savignac Order merged with the Cistercians. It was a daughter house of Combermere Abbey in Cheshire, of which Earl Ranulf was a great benefactor. However, in 1147 the abbot and convent of Savigny transferred it to Buildwas Abbey in Shropshire. Twenty years later, the monks of Basingwerk challenged their subjection to Buildwas, but Savigny found against them and sent a letter notifying their decision to the abbot of Cîteaux, the head of the Cistercian order. An Earl of Chester gave the manor of West Kirby to the Abbey.

In 1157, Owain Gwynedd encamped his army at Basingwerk, though at the Hen Blas site not at the current site, before facing the forces of Henry II at the Battle of Ewloe. The Welsh Prince stopped at the abbey because of its strategic importance. It blocked the route Henry II had to take to reach Twthill, Rhuddlan. In the fighting that followed, Owain Gwynedd split his army routing the English near Ewloe.

The abbey had significant lands in the English county of Derbyshire. Henry II gave the monks a manor near Glossop. The Monks&#x27; Road and the Abbot&#x27;s Chair near the town are a reminder of the Abbey&#x27;s efforts to administer their possession. In 1290 the Abbey gained a market charter for Glossop. The monks also got another charter for nearby Charlesworth in 1328.

By the 13th century, the abbey was under the patronage of Llywelyn the Great, Prince of Gwynedd. His son Dafydd ap Llywelyn gave St Winefride&#x27;s Well to the abbey. The monks harnessed the power of the Holywell stream to run a corn mill and to treat the wool from their sheep. The monks sided with the English in Edward I&#x27;s late 13th century conquest of Wales, for which they were rewarded with permission to hold a market and fair at Holywell. In 1433, the monks leased all of Glossopdale in Derbyshire to the Talbot family, the future Earls of Shrewsbury (1442). The increasing worldliness of the abbey by this time can be seen in the rebuilding of the domestic buildings to make them more comfortable, and in the abbot&#x27;s patronage of bards like Tudor Aled. There was also some laxity in the religious observance - the last abbot, Nicholas Pennant, was the son of his predecessor Thomas.

A legend says a 12th-century Basingwerk Abbey monk was lured into a nearby wood by the singing of a nightingale. He thought he had only been listening a short while, but when he returned, the abbey was in ruins. He crumbled to dust shortly afterwards.

At the Valor Ecclestiasticus survey of 1535, Basingwerk was assessed at £150, putting it among the smaller houses that were earmarked for closure. By this time the number of monks had probably dwindled to two or three. In 1536, abbey life came to an end with the Dissolution of the Monasteries during the reign of Henry VIII. Its dissolution was made lawful by the Dissolution of the Lesser Monasteries Act and the lands of the abbey were granted to lay owners, with the site itself passing to Henry ap Harry of Llanasa. The abbot received a pension of £17 per annum.

Two centuries earlier a Welsh seer, &quot;Robin Ddu&quot; (&quot;Robin the Dark&quot;), said the roof on the refectory would go to a church under Moel Famau. It did: when the abbey was sold, the parts of the roof went to St Mary&#x27;s Church in Cilcain below the slopes of Moel Famau. Another section of roof was reportedly given to the Collegiate and Parochial Church of St Peter at Ruthin, where it still covers the North Nave. Its Jesse window went to the Church of St Dyfnog at Llanrhaeadr-yng-Nghinmeirch. The choir stalls went to St Mary on the Hill, Chester, and some of the roofing lead was used to repair Holt Castle, as well as several royal castles in Ireland.

==Present day==
Since 1923, the remains of the abbey have been in state care. The ruins are part of Greenfield Valley Heritage Park, and are managed by Cadw. In common with most medieval monasteries, the abbey buildings were centred on a large church, with the domestic buildings of the monks in three ranges surrounding a cloister to its south. The majority of the buildings, including the church, were erected in the 13th century. The 50m long cruciform church has been reduced to foundations and low walls except for the south transept, where the west walls still stands high with one high window and the arch that led to the south aisle. Of the buildings round the cloister more remains, as they were converted to a house after the Dissolution. Immediately south of the church is the sacristy, then the chapter house. This is a 12th century room, to which a vaulted eastern section was added, divided by an arcade of two round arches which still stands. Around the walls is the bench on which the monks sat for chapter meetings. To the south is the dormitory undercroft, and to the south of that a warming room was added in the mid-13th century. This end of the range was heavily rebuilt in the later middle ages, with the vault being removed and a new hall and chamber built. Over this range stood the monks&#x27; dormitory, of which part of the side walls still stand, with lancet windows. Extending east from the south end of this range is another range of uncertain date, possibly incorporating the infirmary or abbot&#x27;s house. In the south range are the staircase up to the dormitory, and the refectory. In the normal Cistercian manner, this is aligned north-south, perpendicular to the body of the range. It was a high-quality chamber, and elaborate lancets with Early English shafting survive in the west wall, along with the reader&#x27;s pulpit and the hatch to the kitchen. Of the kitchen, and the entire west range, virtually nothing survives. The latter was separated from the cloister proper by a &#x27;lane&#x27;, as can be better seen at the Cistercian houses of Buildwas and Byland.

The abbey marks the starting point of the North Wales Pilgrims Way.

<text>Broadcasting is the distribution of audio or video content to a dispersed audience via any electronic mass communications medium, but typically one using the electromagnetic spectrum (radio waves), in a one-to-many model. Broadcasting began with AM radio, which came into popular use around 1920 with the spread of vacuum tube radio transmitters and receivers. Before this, most implementations of electronic communication (early radio, telephone, and telegraph) were , with the message intended for a single recipient. The term &quot;broadcasting&quot; evolved from its use as the agricultural method of sowing seeds in a field by casting them broadly about. It was later adopted for describing the widespread distribution of information by printed materials or by telegraph. Examples applying it to &quot;one-to-many&quot; radio transmissions of an individual station to multiple listeners appeared as early as 1898.

Over-the-air broadcasting is usually associated with radio and television, though more recently, both radio and television transmissions have begun to be distributed by cable (cable television). The receiving parties may include the general public or a relatively small subset; the point is that anyone with the appropriate receiving technology and equipment (e.g., a radio or television set) can receive the signal. The field of broadcasting includes both government-managed services such as public radio, community radio and public television, and private commercial radio and commercial television. The U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, title 47, part 97 defines &quot;broadcasting&quot; as &quot;transmissions intended for reception by the general public, either direct or relayed&quot;. Private or two-way telecommunications transmissions do not qualify under this definition. For example, amateur (&quot;ham&quot;) and citizens band (CB) radio operators are not allowed to broadcast. As defined, &quot;transmitting&quot; and &quot;broadcasting&quot; are not the same.

Transmission of radio and television programs from a radio or television station to home receivers by radio waves is referred to as &quot;over the air&quot; (OTA) or terrestrial broadcasting and in most countries requires a broadcasting license. Transmissions using a wire or cable, like cable television (which also retransmits OTA stations with their consent), are also considered broadcasts but do not necessarily require a license (though in some countries, a license is required). In the 2000s, transmissions of television and radio programs via streaming digital technology have increasingly been referred to as broadcasting as well.

== History ==

In 1894, Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi began developing a wireless communication using the then-newly discovered phenomenon of radio waves, showing by 1901 that they could be transmitted across the Atlantic Ocean. This was the start of wireless telegraphy by radio. Audio radio broadcasting began experimentally in the first decade of the 20th century. On 17 December 1902, a transmission from the Marconi station in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, Canada, became the world&#x27;s first radio message to cross the Atlantic from North America. In 1904, a commercial service was established to transmit nightly news summaries to subscribing ships, which incorporated them into their onboard newspapers.

World War I accelerated the development of radio for military communications. After the war, commercial radio AM broadcasting began in the 1920s and became an important mass medium for entertainment and news. World War II again accelerated the development of radio for the wartime purposes of aircraft and land communication, radio navigation, and radar. Development of stereo FM broadcasting of radio began in the 1930s in the United States and the 1970s in the United Kingdom, displacing AM as the dominant commercial standard.

On 25 March 1925, John Logie Baird demonstrated the transmission of moving pictures at the London department store Selfridges. Baird&#x27;s device relied upon the Nipkow disk and thus became known as the mechanical television. It formed the basis of experimental broadcasts done by the British Broadcasting Corporation beginning on 30 September 1929. However, for most of the 20th century, televisions depended on the cathode-ray tube invented by Karl Braun. The first version of such a television to show promise was produced by Philo Farnsworth and demonstrated to his family on 7 September 1927. After World War II, interrupted experiments resumed and television became an important home entertainment broadcast medium, using VHF and UHF spectrum. Satellite broadcasting was initiated in the 1960s and moved into general industry usage in the 1970s, with DBS (Direct Broadcast Satellites) emerging in the 1980s.

Originally, all broadcasting was composed of analog signals using analog transmission techniques but in the 2000s, broadcasters switched to digital signals using digital transmission. An analog signal is any continuous signal representing some other quantity, i.e., &quot;analogous&quot; to another quantity. For example, in an analog audio signal, the instantaneous signal voltage varies continuously with the pressure of the sound waves. In contrast, a digital signal represents the original time-varying quantity as a sampled sequence of quantized values which imposes some bandwidth and dynamic range constraints on the representation. In general usage, broadcasting most frequently refers to the transmission of information and entertainment programming from various sources to the general public:
* Analog audio radio (AM, FM) vs. digital audio radio (HD radio), digital audio broadcasting (DAB), satellite radio and digital Radio Mondiale (DRM)
* Analog television vs. digital television
* Wireless

The world&#x27;s technological capacity to receive information through one-way broadcast networks more than quadrupled during the two decades from 1986 to 2007, from 432 exabytes of (optimally compressed) information, to 1.9 zettabytes. This is the information equivalent of 55 newspapers per person per day in 1986, and 175 newspapers per person per day by 2007.

==Methods==
In a broadcast system, the central high-powered broadcast tower transmits a high-frequency electromagnetic wave to numerous receivers. The high-frequency wave sent by the tower is modulated with a signal containing visual or audio information. The receiver is then tuned so as to pick up the high-frequency wave and a demodulator is used to retrieve the signal containing the visual or audio information. The broadcast signal can be either analog (signal is varied continuously with respect to the information) or digital (information is encoded as a set of discrete values).

Historically, there have been several methods used for broadcasting electronic media audio and video to the general public:
* Telephone broadcasting (1881–1932): the earliest form of electronic broadcasting (not counting data services offered by stock telegraph companies from 1867, if ticker-tapes are excluded from the definition). Telephone broadcasting began with the advent of Théâtrophone (&quot;Theatre Phone&quot;) systems, which were telephone-based distribution systems allowing subscribers to listen to live opera and theatre performances over telephone lines, created by French inventor Clément Ader in 1881. Telephone broadcasting also grew to include telephone newspaper services for news and entertainment programming which were introduced in the 1890s, primarily located in large European cities. These telephone-based subscription services were the first examples of electrical/electronic broadcasting and offered a wide variety of programming.
* Radio broadcasting (experimentally from 1906, commercially from 1920); audio signals sent through the air as radio waves from a transmitter, picked up by an antenna and sent to a receiver. Radio stations can be linked in radio networks to broadcast common radio programs, either in broadcast syndication, simulcast or subchannels.
** Television broadcasting (telecast), experimentally from 1925, commercially from the 1930s: an extension of radio to include video signals.
* Cable radio (also called &quot;cable FM&quot;, from 1928) and cable television (from 1932): both via coaxial cable, originally serving principally as transmission media for programming produced at either radio or television stations, but later expanding into a broad universe of cable-originated channels.
* Direct-broadcast satellite (DBS) (from ) and satellite radio (from ): meant for direct-to-home broadcast programming (as opposed to studio network uplinks and down-links), provides a mix of traditional radio or television broadcast programming, or both, with dedicated satellite radio programming. (See also: Satellite television)
* Webcasting of video/television (from ) and audio/radio (from ) streams: offers a mix of traditional radio and television station broadcast programming with dedicated Internet radio and Internet television.

==Economic models==

There are several means of providing financial support for continuous broadcasting:
* Commercial broadcasting: for-profit, usually privately owned stations, channels, networks, or services providing programming to the public, supported by the sale of air time to advertisers for radio or television advertisements during or in breaks between programs, often in combination with cable or pay cable subscription fees.
* Public broadcasting: usually non-profit, publicly owned stations or networks supported by license fees, government funds, grants from foundations, corporate underwriting, audience memberships, contributions or a combination of these.
* Community broadcasting: a form of mass media in which a television station, or a radio station, is owned, operated or programmed, by a community group to provide programs of local interest known as local programming. Community stations are most commonly operated by non-profit groups or cooperatives; however, in some cases they may be operated by a local college or university, a cable company or a municipal government.
* Internet Webcast: the audience pays to recharge and buy virtual gifts for the anchor, and the platform converts the gifts into virtual currency. The anchor withdraws the virtual currency, which is drawn by the platform. If the anchor belongs to a trade union, it will be settled by the trade union and the live broadcasting platform, and the anchor will get the salary and part of the bonus. This is the most common profit model of live broadcast products.

Broadcasters may rely on a combination of these business models. For example, in the United States, National Public Radio (NPR) and the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS, television) supplement public membership subscriptions and grants with funding from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), which is allocated bi-annually by Congress. US public broadcasting corporate and charitable grants are generally given in consideration of underwriting spots which differ from commercial advertisements in that they are governed by specific FCC restrictions, which prohibit the advocacy of a product or a &quot;call to action&quot;.

==Recorded and live forms==

The first regular television broadcasts started in 1937. Broadcasts can be classified as &quot;recorded&quot; or &quot;live&quot;. The former allows correcting errors, and removing superfluous or undesired material, rearranging it, applying slow-motion and repetitions, and other techniques to enhance the program. However, some live events like sports television can include some of the aspects including slow-motion clips of important goals/hits, etc., in between the live television telecast. American radio-network broadcasters habitually forbade prerecorded broadcasts in the 1930s and 1940s, requiring radio programs played for the Eastern and Central time zones to be repeated three hours later for the Pacific time zone (See: Effects of time on North American broadcasting). This restriction was dropped for special occasions, as in the case of the German dirigible airship &quot;Hindenburg&quot; disaster at Lakehurst, New Jersey, in 1937. During World War II, prerecorded broadcasts from war correspondents were allowed on U.S. radio. In addition, American radio programs were recorded for playback by Armed Forces Radio radio stations around the world.

A disadvantage of recording first is that the public may learn the outcome of an event before the recording is broadcast, which may be a spoiler. Prerecording may be used to prevent announcers from deviating from an officially approved script during a live radio broadcast, as occurred with propaganda broadcasts from Germany in the 1940s and with Radio Moscow in the 1980s. Many events are advertised as being live, although they are often recorded live (sometimes called &quot;live-to-tape&quot;). This is particularly true of performances of musical artists on radio when they visit for an in-studio concert performance. Similar situations have occurred in television production (&quot;&quot;The Cosby Show&quot; is recorded in front of a live television studio audience&quot;) and news broadcasting.

A broadcast may be distributed through several physical means. If coming directly from the radio studio at a single station or television station, it is sent through the studio/transmitter link to the transmitter and hence from the television antenna located on the radio masts and towers out to the world. Programming may also come through a communications satellite, played either live or recorded for later transmission. Networks of stations may simulcast the same programming at the same time, originally via microwave link, now usually by satellite. Distribution to stations or networks may also be through physical media, such as magnetic tape, compact disc (CD), DVD, and sometimes other formats. Usually these are included in another broadcast, such as when electronic news gathering (ENG) returns a story to the station for inclusion on a news programme.

The final leg of broadcast distribution is how the signal gets to the listener or viewer. It may come over the air as with a radio station or television station to an antenna and radio receiver, or may come through cable television or cable radio (or wireless cable) via the station or directly from a network. The Internet may also bring either internet radio or streaming media television to the recipient, especially with multicasting allowing the signal and bandwidth to be shared. The term &quot;broadcast network&quot; is often used to distinguish networks that broadcast over-the-air television signals that can be received using a tuner inside a television set with a television antenna from so-called networks that are broadcast only via cable television (cablecast) or satellite television that uses a dish antenna. The term &quot;broadcast television&quot; can refer to the television programs of such networks.

==Social impact==

The sequencing of content in a broadcast is called a schedule. As with all technological endeavors, a number of technical terms and slang have developed. A list of these terms can be found at List of broadcasting terms. Television and radio programs are distributed through radio broadcasting or cable, often both simultaneously. By coding signals and having a cable converter box with decoding equipment in homes, the latter also enables subscription-based channels, pay-tv and pay-per-view services. In his essay, John Durham Peters wrote that communication is a tool used for dissemination. Peters stated, &quot;Dissemination is a lens—sometimes a usefully distorting one—that helps us tackle basic issues such as interaction, presence, and space and time ... on the agenda of any future communication theory in general&quot;. Dissemination focuses on the message being relayed from one main source to one large audience without the exchange of dialogue in between. It is possible for the message to be changed or corrupted by government officials once the main source releases it. There is no way to predetermine how the larger population or audience will absorb the message. They can choose to listen, analyze, or ignore it. Dissemination in communication is widely used in the world of broadcasting.

Broadcasting focuses on getting a message out and it is up to the general public to do what they wish with it. Peters also states that broadcasting is used to address an open-ended destination. There are many forms of broadcasting, but they all aim to distribute a signal that will reach the target audience. Broadcasters typically arrange audiences into entire assemblies. In terms of media broadcasting, a radio show can gather a large number of followers who tune in every day to specifically listen to that specific disc jockey. The disc jockey follows the script for their radio show and just talks into the microphone. They do not expect immediate feedback from any listeners. The message is broadcast across airwaves throughout the community, but the listeners cannot always respond immediately, especially since many radio shows are recorded prior to the actual air time. Conversely, receivers can select opt-in or opt-out of getting broadcast messages using an Excel file, offering them control over the information they receive.

== Broadcast engineering ==

Broadcast engineering is the field of electrical engineering, and now to some extent computer engineering and information technology, which deals with radio and television broadcasting. Audio engineering and RF engineering are also essential parts of broadcast engineering, being their own subsets of electrical engineering.

Broadcast engineering involves both the studio and transmitter aspects (the entire airchain), as well as remote broadcasts. Every station has a broadcast engineer, though one may now serve an entire station group in a city. In small media markets the engineer may work on a contract basis for one or more stations as needed.

<doc id="113608" wikidata="Q2519667" url="?curid=113608" title="Leiston">
<text>Leiston ( ) is a town and civil parish in the East Suffolk district of Suffolk, England. It is close to Saxmundham and Aldeburgh, north-east of Ipswich and north-east of London. The town had a population of 5,508 at the 2011 Census.

==History==
The 14th-century remains of Leiston Abbey lie north-west of the town.

Leiston thrived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as a manufacturing town, dominated by Richard Garrett &amp; Sons, owners of Leiston Works, which boasted the world&#x27;s first flow assembly line, for the manufacture of portable steam engines. The firm also made steam tractors and a huge variety of cast and machined metal products, including munitions during both world wars. The works closed in 1981 and the site was reused as a mixture of housing, flats and industrial sites. The Long Shop Museum, showing the history, vehicles and products of the works, remains as a heritage tourist attraction.

In 1927, A. S. Neill relocated Summerhill School from Lyme Regis to Leiston. This was the first major &quot;free school&quot; – referring to freedom in education. Children are not required to attend classes and discipline is meted by pupil self-government meetings. Summerhill has inspired a large &quot;free school&quot; movement and more recently, democratic schools in several countries. The school occupies the former mansion of Richard Garrett, owner of Leiston Works.

In the Second World War, RAF Leiston, north-west of the town in the neighbouring village of Theberton, sent fighter squadrons of the American 357th Fighter Group to fight the Luftwaffe. Famous American test pilot and fighter ace General Chuck Yeager (later, first to break the sound barrier) flew out of RAF Leiston. The Friends of Leiston Airfield hold a memorial service and flying display at the end of May each year, with veterans and their families attending.

===Notable people===
In birth order:
*Ranulf de Glanvill (died 1190), Chief Justiciar of England, founded Leiston Abbey for White Canons in 1183.
*Richard Garrett (1755–1839) founded the engineering company Richard Garrett and Sons in Leiston.
*Edward Buckton Lamb (1806–1869), architect, designed St Margaret&#x27;s Church in Leiston.
*Newson Garrett (1812–1893), born in Leiston, built up the malting business whose premises were converted into the Snape Maltings concert hall.
*A. S. Neill (1883–1973), Scottish educationalist, founded the progressive Summerhill School in 1924 and moved it to Leiston in 1927. 
*M. E. Aldrich Rope (1891–1988), born and died in Leiston, was a stained-glass artist in the Arts and Crafts tradition.
*Paxton Chadwick (1903–1961), artist and illustrator, taught at Summerhill and was Communist chair of Leiston Town Council.
*Ryan Meikle (born 1996), darts player

==Governance==
There is an electoral ward named Leiston, with a population at the 2011 census of 6,360.

In 1895 Leiston became an urban district under the name Leiston cum Sizewell which became part of the administrative county of East Suffolk in 1889, the district contained the parish of Leiston. On 1 April 1974 the district was abolished and became part of Suffolk Coastal in the non-metropolitan county of Suffolk. A successor parish was formed named &quot;Leiston&quot; covering the same area as the former district and its parish. In 2019 Leiston became part of East Suffolk district.

==Economy and community==
===Business===
Since the closure of Garrett&#x27;s, the town&#x27;s economy has been dominated by two nuclear power stations on the coast at Sizewell: the now decommissioned Magnox reactors of Sizewell A, and the more modern 1,200 MW Pressurised Water Reactor of Sizewell B. The 850 MW Greater Gabbard and Galloper offshore wind farms connect to the Leiston substation adjacent to the Sizewell nuclear power station; all supplying power to the 400kV National Grid.

A number of smaller companies operate from industrial areas within the town.

Leiston&#x27;s High Street serves as the business and market hub of the surrounding agricultural district. The town&#x27;s facilities include a post office, library, banks, pubs and a range of shops and other services.

===Transport===
A railway branch spur from the Great Eastern line, known as the Aldeburgh branch line, went from Saxmundham to Aldeburgh, with intermediate stations at Leiston and Thorpeness. On 12 September 1966 British Rail withdrew all passenger services to Leiston and beyond. However, the line to Leiston remained active for the purpose of removing nuclear materials from Sizewell power station.

Leiston has direct bus services to Ipswich, Saxmundham, Aldeburgh, Thorpeness and Halesworth.

===Culture===
Leiston Film Theatre, a half-timbered building with street front shops, is the oldest purpose-built cinema in Suffolk. The cinema is owned and run by Leiston-cum-Sizewell Town Council and backed by Leiston Film Theatre Support Club, which has raised money for stage refurbishment and enabled the cinema to install a digital 3D projection system.

The town has a traditional Anglican church, St Margaret&#x27;s, with an ancient tower and an unusual 19th-century nave. There are Roman Catholic and Baptist churches on the edge of the town.

===Sport and leisure===
The town&#x27;s football club is Leiston F.C., who as of the 2023–24 season play in the Southern League Premier Central. In November 2008 the team reached the first round of the FA Cup for the first time in its history, drawing 0–0 with Fleetwood Town before losing the replay 2–0.

Leiston also has a leisure centre, a skate park and several parks.

Leiston and Thorpeness Rugby Club was in existence in the late 1980s and early 1990s. It closed in 1995, but was revived in March 2010 as Aldeburgh and Thorpeness Rugby Club, with many of the previous club&#x27;s members.

===Media===
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from the Tacolneston TV transmitter and via a local relay transmitter in Aldeburgh.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Suffolk, Heart East, Greatest Hits Radio Ipswich &amp; Suffolk, and Alde and Blyth Community Radio (ABC), a community based station. 

The town&#x27;s local newspaper is the &quot;East Anglian Daily Times&quot;.

===Education===
Other than Summerhill School, Leiston also has conventional primary and secondary schools.

Leiston Primary School caters for pupils aged 5–11 and runs a nursery with 52 places.

Alde Valley Academy is a secondary school with academy status, formerly known as Leiston Community High School, then as Alde Valley School from September 2012, after reorganisation involving the closure of Leiston Middle School and conversion from a 13–18 school to one taking pupils from the age of 11. The school received academy status in January 2015 and was renamed Alde Valley Academy.

In 2001 the school had become a Specialist Technology College, and in following years was named as one of the most improved schools in England. It was the lead school in the Schools Energy Network based at the Orbis Centre in Lowestoft and had strong links with the Sizewell nuclear power stations.

<doc id="113609" wikidata="Q1333582" url="?curid=113609" title="Richard Wilbur">
<text>Richard Purdy Wilbur (March 1, 1921 – October 14, 2017) was an American poet and literary translator. One of the foremost poets, along with his friend Anthony Hecht, of the World War II generation, Wilbur&#x27;s work, often employing rhyme, and composed primarily in traditional forms, was marked by its wit, charm, and gentlemanly elegance. He was acclaimed in his youth as the heir to Robert Frost, translated the verse dramas of Moliere, Corneille, and Racine into rhymed English, collaborated with Leonard Bernstein as the lyricist for the opera &quot;Candide&quot;, and in his old age acted, particularly through his role in the annual West Chester University Poetry Conference, as a mentor to the younger poets of the New Formalist movement. He was appointed the second Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress in 1987 and received the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry twice, in 1957 and 1989.

==Early years==
Wilbur was born in New York City on March 1, 1921, and grew up in North Caldwell, New Jersey. In 1938 he graduated from Montclair High School, where he worked on the school newspaper. At Amherst College, he also displayed his &quot;ample literary gifts&quot; as one of the &quot;sharpest&quot; reporters for the college newspaper, edited by upperclassman Robert Morgenthau. After graduation in 1942, he served in the United States Army from 1943 to 1945 during World War II. He attended graduate school at Harvard University. Wilbur taught at Wellesley College, then Wesleyan University for two decades and at Smith College for another decade. At Wesleyan he was instrumental in founding the award-winning poetry series of the Wesleyan University Press. He received two Pulitzer Prizes for Poetry and taught at Amherst College as late as 2009, where he also served on the editorial board of the literary magazine &quot;The Common&quot;.

==Literary career==
When only eight years old, Wilbur published his first poem in &quot;John Martin&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. His first book, &quot;The Beautiful Changes and Other Poems&quot;, appeared in 1947. Thereafter he published several volumes of poetry, including &quot;New and Collected Poems&quot; (Faber, 1989). Wilbur was also a translator, specializing in the 17th century French comedies of Molière and dramas of Jean Racine. His translation of &quot;Tartuffe&quot; has become the play&#x27;s standard English version and has been presented on television twice (a 1978 production is available on DVD). Wilbur also published several children&#x27;s books, including &quot;Opposites&quot;, &quot;More Opposites&quot;, and &quot;The Disappearing Alphabet.&quot; In 1959 he became the general editor of The Laurel Poetry Series (Dell Publishing).

Continuing the tradition of Robert Frost and W. H. Auden, Wilbur&#x27;s poetry finds illumination in everyday experiences. Less well-known is Wilbur&#x27;s foray into writing theatre lyrics. He provided lyrics to several songs in Leonard Bernstein&#x27;s 1956 musical &quot;Candide&quot;, including the famous &quot;Glitter and Be Gay&quot; and &quot;Make Our Garden Grow&quot;. He also produced several unpublished works, including &quot;The Wing&quot; and &quot;To Beatrice&quot;.

<text>Stockholm County ( ) is a county () on the Baltic Sea coast of Sweden. It borders Uppsala County and Södermanland County. It also borders Mälaren and the Baltic Sea. The city of Stockholm is the capital of Sweden. Stockholm County is divided by the historic provinces of Uppland (Roslagen) and Södermanland (Södertörn). More than one fifth of the Swedish population lives in the county. Stockholm County is also one of the statistical (national areas) according to , Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics within the EU. With more than two million inhabitants, Stockholm is the most densely populated county of Sweden.

==History==
Stockholm County was established in 1714. The City of Stockholm then constituted its own administrative entity under the Governor of Stockholm and was not part of Stockholm County. Though outside Stockholm County, the City of Stockholm was its seat.

On 1 January 1968, Stockholm County was united with the City of Stockholm. At the same time, the borders were redrawn in other directions too; Upplands-Bro Municipality was transferred from Uppsala County and a large part of the modern day Östhammar Municipality was transferred to Uppsala County.

* Långsjön, Hanveden
* Lundsjön–Dammsjön
* Måsnaren
* Ramsjön, Haninge kommun
* Segersjön
* Strålsjön
* Tullan
* Yngern

== Economy ==
The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the region was 145.6 billion € in 2018, accounting for 30.9% of Swedish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was €49,500 or 164% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 132% of the EU average.

== Heraldry ==
Arms granted in 1968. The arms for the County of Stockholm is a combination of the arms of Uppland, Södermanland and the City of Stockholm. When it is shown with a royal crown it represents the County Administrative Board.

SCB have collected statistics on backgrounds of residents since 2002. These tables consist of all who have two foreign-born parents or are born abroad themselves. The chart lists election years and the last year on record alone.


== County Administrative Board ==
Prior to 1968 the County of Stockholm did not include the City of Stockholm. The City was instead under the Office of the Governor of Stockholm, and the County included the surrounding countryside. The County had its separate Governor of Stockholm County.

The main aim of the County Administrative Board is to fulfill the goals set in national politics by the Riksdag and the Government, to coordinate the interests of the county, to promote the development of the county, to establish regional goals and safeguard the due process of law in the handling of each case. The County Administrative Board is a Government Agency headed by a governor.

See List of Stockholm Governors.

==County council==
The local administration of the county is under Stockholm County Council (&quot;Stockholms läns landsting&quot;). Its main responsibilities are for the public healthcare system and public transport.

The county council has 149 members elected by proportional representation through elections held in conjunction with the general elections every four years. The county council itself elects the county&#x27;s executive committee.

The president of the committee also holds the title &quot;Commissioner of Finance&quot;. The president is Aida Hadzialic, of the Social Democratic Party, who previously served as a minister in the Ministry of Education and Research. The members of the executive committee (&quot;landstingsstyrelsen&quot;) represent both the political majority and the opposition, with responsibility for implementing policies approved by the county council.

===Elections===
Stockholm County contains two multi-seat constituencies for county council elections. Stockholm Municipality makes up the first constituency while the second makes up the rest of the county.

====Council elections 2002-2018====
===Hospitals===
The county council operates most of the hospitals in the county, some of the major facilities are:

*Karolinska University Hospital. The hospital contains two major facilities; one in Solna and one in Huddinge (since the merger with Huddinge University Hospital in 2004).
*Södersjukhuset
*Danderyd Hospital
*Södertälje Hospital
*Norrtälje Hospital
*S:t Erik Ocular Clinic

===Public transport===
The county council is responsible for the public transport in Stockholm. The main organizers of the transportation system are two publicly owned companies. Storstockholms Lokaltrafik, SL, handles the bus, tram and train services while the boat traffic is handled by Waxholmsbolaget. The operation and maintenance of the public transport systems is delegated by the companies to several contractors.

The county is also responsible for paratransit services and &quot;Närtrafiken&quot;, a number of share taxi routes.

<text>Flag terminology is the nomenclature, or system of terms, used in vexillology, the study of flags, to describe precisely the parts, patterns, and other attributes of flags and their display.

==Flag types==

















==Flag elements==









==Basic patterns==
Flags often inherit traits seen in traditional European heraldry designs, and as a result, patterns often share names.

==Techniques in flag display==



=== Illustrations ===
Flag illustrations generally depict flags flying from the observer&#x27;s point of view from left to right, the view known as the obverse (or &quot;front&quot;); the other side is the reverse (or &quot;back&quot;). There are some exceptions, notably some Islamic flags inscribed in Arabic, which is written from right to left; for these the obverse is defined as the side with the hoist to the observer&#x27;s right.

<text>Charles Gordon MacArthur (November 5, 1895 – April 21, 1956) was an American playwright, screenwriter, and 1935 winner of the Academy Award for Best Story.

==Life and career==

MacArthur was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the sixth of seven children of stern evangelist William Telfer MacArthur and Georgiana Welsted MacArthur. Early in life, MacArthur developed a passion for reading. Declining to follow his father into ministry, he moved to the Midwest and soon became a successful reporter in Chicago, working for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;. MacArthur joined the United States Army for World War I, and served in France as a private assigned to Battery F, 149th Field Artillery, a unit of the 42nd Division, The Rainbow Division. He recounted his wartime experience in 1919&#x27;s &quot;A Bug&#x27;s-Eye View of the War&quot;. After the war, he wrote several short stories, two of which, &quot;Hang It All&quot; (1921) and &quot;Rope&quot; (1923), were published in H. L. Mencken&#x27;s &quot;The Smart Set&quot; magazine. Eventually he settled in New York City, where he turned to playwriting.

MacArthur is best known for his plays in collaboration with Ben Hecht, &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen&quot; (filmed as &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;), &quot;Twentieth Century&quot; and the frequently filmed &quot;The Front Page&quot;, which was based in part on MacArthur&#x27;s experiences at the City News Bureau of Chicago. MacArthur also co-wrote, with Edward Sheldon, the play &quot;Lulu Belle&quot;, which was staged in 1926 by David Belasco.

MacArthur was friends with members of the Algonquin Round Table, shared an apartment with Robert Benchley and had an affair with Dorothy Parker.

His second marriage was to the stage and screen actress Helen Hayes, from 1928 until his death. They lived in Nyack, New York. He was preceded in death by his daughter, Mary, who died of polio in 1949 at the age of 19. The shock of her death hastened MacArthur&#x27;s own, according to those who knew him. Their adopted son, James MacArthur, was also an actor, best known for playing Danny &quot;Danno&quot; Williams on the very popular American television series &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;.

His brother, John D. MacArthur, was an insurance-company owner and executive, and founded the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the benefactor of the MacArthur Fellowships.

==Awards and nominations==
Academy Award for Best Writing, Original Story - &quot;The Scoundrel&quot; (shared with Ben Hecht) (1936)
* Nominations:
**Best Writing, Screenplay - &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (shared with Ben Hecht) in 1940
**Best Writing, Original Story - &quot;Rasputin and the Empress&quot; in 1934

In 1983, MacArthur was posthumously inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

==Film portrayal==
MacArthur was portrayed by Matthew Broderick in the 1994 film &quot;Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle&quot;.

<doc id="113616" wikidata="Q207535" url="?curid=113616" title="Roland">
<text>Roland (; ; or &quot;Rotholandus&quot;; or &quot;Rolando&quot;; died 15 August 778) was a Frankish military leader under Charlemagne who became one of the principal figures in the literary cycle known as the Matter of France. The historical Roland was military governor of the Breton March, responsible for defending Francia&#x27;s frontier against the Bretons. His only historical attestation is in Einhard&#x27;s &quot;Vita Karoli Magni&quot;, which notes he was part of the Frankish rearguard killed in retribution by the Basques in Iberia at the Battle of Roncevaux Pass.

The story of Roland&#x27;s death at Roncevaux Pass was embellished in later medieval and Renaissance literature. The first and most famous of these epic treatments was the Old French &quot;Chanson de Roland&quot; of the 11th century.

Two masterpieces of Italian Renaissance poetry, the &quot;Orlando Innamorato&quot; and &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; (by Matteo Maria Boiardo and Ludovico Ariosto, respectively), are even further detached from history than the earlier &quot;Chansons&quot;, similarly to the later &quot;Morgante&quot; by Luigi Pulci. Roland is poetically associated with his sword Durendal, his horse Veillantif, and his oliphant horn.

In the late 17th century, French Baroque composer Jean-Baptiste Lully wrote an opera titled &quot;Roland&quot;, based on the story of the title character.

== History ==

The only historical mention of the actual Roland is in the &quot;Vita Karoli Magni&quot; by Charlemagne&#x27;s courtier and biographer Einhard. Einhard refers to him as &quot;Hruodlandus Brittannici limitis praefectus&quot; (&quot;Roland, prefect of the borders of Brittany&quot;), indicating that he presided over the Breton March, Francia&#x27;s border territory against the Bretons. The passage, which appears in Chapter 9, mentions that &quot;Hroudlandus&quot; (a Latinization of the Frankish &quot;*Hrōþiland&quot;, from &quot;*hrōþi&quot;, &quot;praise&quot;/&quot;fame&quot; and *&quot;land&quot;, &quot;country&quot;) was among those killed in the Battle of Roncevaux Pass:

Roland was evidently the first official appointed to direct Frankish policy in Breton affairs, as local Franks under the Merovingian dynasty had not previously pursued any specific relationship with the Bretons. Their frontier castle districts such as Vitré, Ille-et-Vilaine, south of Mont Saint-Michel, are now divided between Normandy and Brittany. The distinctive culture of this region preserves the present-day Gallo language and legends of local heroes such as Roland. Roland&#x27;s successor in &quot;Brittania Nova&quot; was Guy of Nantes, who like Roland, was unable to exert Frankish expansion over Brittany and merely sustained a Breton presence in the Carolingian Empire.

According to legend, Roland was laid to rest in the basilica at Blaye, near Bordeaux, on the site of the citadel.

== Medieval icon ==

Roland was turned into a popular and iconic figure of medieval Europe and its minstrel culture. Many tales made him a nephew of Charlemagne and turned his life into an epic tale of the noble Christian killed by hostile forces, which forms part of the medieval Matter of France.

The tale of Roland&#x27;s death is retold in the 11th-century poem &quot;The Song of Roland&quot;, where he is equipped with the olifant (a signaling horn) and an unbreakable sword, enchanted by various Christian relics, named Durendal. The &quot;Song&quot; contains a highly romanticized account of the Battle of Roncevaux Pass and Roland&#x27;s death, setting the tone for later fantastical depiction of Charlemagne&#x27;s court.

It was adapted and modified throughout the Middle Ages, including an influential Latin prose version &quot;Historia Caroli Magni&quot; (latterly known as the &quot;Pseudo-Turpin Chronicle&quot;), which also includes Roland&#x27;s battle with a Saracen giant named Ferracutus who is only vulnerable at his navel. The story was later adapted in the anonymous Franco-Venetian epic &quot;L&#x27;Entrée d&#x27;Espagne&quot; ( 1320) and in the 14th-century Italian epic &quot;La Spagna&quot;, attributed to the Florentine Sostegno di Zanobi and likely composed between 1350 and 1360.

Other texts give further legendary accounts of Roland&#x27;s life. His friendship with Olivier and his engagement with Olivier&#x27;s sister Aude are told in &quot;Girart de Vienne&quot; by Bertrand de Bar-sur-Aube. Roland&#x27;s youth and the acquisition of his horse Veillantif and sword are described in &quot;Aspremont&quot;. Roland also appears in &quot;Quatre Fils Aymon&quot;, where he is contrasted with Renaud de Montauban against whom he occasionally fights.

In Norway, the tales of Roland are part of the 13th-century &quot;Karlamagnús saga&quot;.

In the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; Dante sees Roland, named Orlando as is usual in Italian literature, in the Heaven of Mars together with others who fought for the faith.

Roland appears in &quot;Entrée d&#x27;Espagne&quot;, a 14th-century Franco-Venetian chanson de geste (in which he is transformed into a knight errant, similar to heroes from the Arthurian romances) and &quot;La Spagna&quot;, a 14th-century Italian epic.

From the 15th century onwards, Roland appears as a central character in a sequence of Italian verse romances as &quot;Orlando&quot;, including &quot;Morgante&quot; by Luigi Pulci, &quot;Orlando Innamorato&quot; by Matteo Maria Boiardo, and &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot; by Ludovico Ariosto. (See below for his later history in Italian verse.) The &quot;Orlandino&quot; of Pietro Aretino then waxed satirical about the &quot;cult of personality&quot; of Orlando the hero. The Orlando narrative inspired several composers, amongst whom were Claudio Monteverdi, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Antonio Vivaldi and George Frideric Handel, who composed an Italian-language opera with &quot;Orlando&quot;.

In Germany, Roland gradually became a symbol of the independence of the growing cities from the local nobility. In the late Middle Ages many cities featured defiant statues of Roland in their marketplaces. The Roland in Wedel was erected in 1450 as symbol of market and Hanseatic justice, and the Roland statue in front of Bremen City Hall (1404) has been listed together with the city hall itself on the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites since 2004.

In the Faroe Islands, Roland appears in the ballad of &quot;Runtsivalstríðið&quot; (Battle of Roncevaux).

== Legacy==

In Aragón there are several placenames related to Roldán or Rolando, including the mountain pass Roland&#x27;s Breach and the rock formation Salto de Roldán.

In Catalonia Roland (or &quot;Rotllà&quot;, as it is rendered in Catalan) became a legendary giant. Numerous places in Catalonia (both North and South) have a name related to &quot;Rotllà&quot;. In step with the trace left by the character in the whole Pyrenean area, Basque &quot;Errolan&quot; turns up in numerous legends and place-names associated with a mighty giant, usually a heathen, capable of launching huge stones. The Basque word &quot;erraldoi&quot; (giant) stems from &quot;Errol(d)an&quot;, as pointed out by the linguist Koldo Mitxelena.

Jean Lannes, a Marshal of the First French Empire, was given the nickname &quot;Roland de l&#x27;Armée d&#x27;Italie,&quot; which later became &quot;Roland de la Grande Armée&quot;, for his bravery and charisma.

A statue of Roland stands in the city of Rolândia in Brazil. The city was established by German immigrants, many of them refugees from Nazi Germany, who named their new home after Roland to represent freedom.

Roland is a servant in the game &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot;, portrayed as a faithful servant to God and a righteous paladin.

Roland also serves as one of the protagonists of the South Korean video game &quot;Library of Ruina&quot;, with many elements taken from his appearances in &quot;Orlando Innamorato&quot; and &quot;Orlando Furioso&quot;.

The character &quot;A Knight&quot; in the video game &quot;&quot; references, and is heavily implied to be Roland, including reciting the &quot;Rolandskvadet&quot; in his voice lines. 

The English expression &quot;to give a Roland for an Oliver&quot;, meaning either to offer a or &quot;to give as good as one gets&quot;, recalls the &quot;Chanson de Roland&quot; and Roland&#x27;s companion Oliver.

<text>Ahmed Hassan Zewail (February 26, 1946 – August 2, 2016) was an Egyptian-American chemist, known as the &quot;father of femtochemistry&quot;. He was awarded the 1999 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on femtochemistry and became the first Egyptian and Arab to win a Nobel Prize in a scientific field, and also first African to win a Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He was the Linus Pauling Chair Professor of Chemistry, a professor of physics, and the director of the Physical Biology Center for Ultrafast Science and Technology at the California Institute of Technology.

==Early life and education==
Ahmed Hassan Zewail was born on February 26, 1946, in Damanhur, Egypt, and was raised in Desouk. He received Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees in chemistry from Alexandria University before moving to the United States to complete his PhD at the University of Pennsylvania under the supervision of Robin M. Hochstrasser.

==Career==
After completing his PhD, Zewail did postdoctoral research at the University of California, Berkeley, supervised by Charles B. Harris. Following this, he was awarded a faculty appointment at the California Institute of Technology in 1976, and eventually became the first Linus Pauling Chair in Chemical Physics there. He became a naturalized citizen of the United States on March 5, 1982. Zewail was the director of the Physical Biology Center for Ultrafast Science and Technology at the California Institute of Technology.
Zewail was nominated and participated in President Barack Obama&#x27;s Presidential Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), an advisory group of the nation&#x27;s leading scientists and engineers to advise the President and Vice President and formulate policy in the areas of science, technology, and innovation.

==Research==
Zewail&#x27;s key work was a pioneer of femtochemistry—i.e. the study of chemical reactions across femtoseconds. Using a rapid ultrafast laser technique (consisting of ultrashort laser flashes), the technique allows the description of reactions on very short time scales – short enough to analyse transition states in selected chemical reactions. 
Zewail became known as the &quot;father of femtochemistry&quot;. He also made critical contributions in ultrafast electron diffraction, which uses short electron pulses rather than light pulses to study chemical reaction dynamics.

==Political work==
In a speech at Cairo University on June 4, 2009, US President Barack Obama proclaimed a new Science Envoy program as part of a &quot;new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world.&quot; In January 2010, Ahmed Zewail, Elias Zerhouni, and Bruce Alberts became the first US science envoys to Islam, visiting Muslim-majority countries from North Africa to Southeast Asia.When asked about rumors that he might contest the 2011 Egyptian presidential election, Ahmed Zewail said: &quot;I am a frank man... I have no political ambition, as I have stressed repeatedly that I only want to serve Egypt in the field of science and die as a scientist.&quot;

During the 2011 Egyptian protests he announced his return to the country. Zewail said that he would join a committee for constitutional reform alongside Ayman Nour, Mubarak&#x27;s rival at the 2005 presidential elections and a leading lawyer.
Zewail was later mentioned as a respected figure working as an intermediary between the military regime ruling after Mubarak&#x27;s resignation, and revolutionary youth groups such as the April 6 Youth Movement and young supporters of Mohamed ElBaradei. He played a critical role during this time as described by Egyptian Media.

==Awards and honours==
Zewail&#x27;s work brought him international attention, receiving awards and honors throughout most of his career for his work in chemistry and physics. In 1999, Zewail became the first Egyptian to receive a science Nobel Prize when he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Zewail gave his Nobel Lecture on &quot;Femtochemistry: Atomic-Scale Dynamics of the Chemical Bond Using Ultrafast Lasers&quot;.

In 1999, he received Egypt&#x27;s highest state honour, the Grand Collar of the Nile. Other notable awards include the Alexander von Humboldt Senior Scientist Award (1983), the King Faisal International Prize (1989), the Wolf Prize in Chemistry (1993), the Earle K. Plyler Prize (1993), the Herbert P. Broida Prize (1995), the Peter Debye Award (1996), the Tolman Award (1997), the Robert A. Welch Award (1997), the Linus Pauling Medal (1997), the Franklin Medal (1998) and the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement (2000). In October 2006, Zewail received the Albert Einstein World Award of Science for &quot;his pioneering development of the new field of femtoscience and for his seminal contributions to the revolutionary discipline of physical biology, creating new ways for better understanding the functional behavior of biological systems by directly visualizing them in the four dimensions of space and time.&quot; Zewail was awarded the Othmer Gold Medal (2009), the Priestley Medal (2011) from the American Chemical Society and the Davy Medal (2011) from the Royal Society.

In 1982 he was named as a Fellow of the American Physical Society. Zewail became a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1989, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1993, and the American Philosophical Society in 1998. Zewail was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2001. He was also elected as a Fellow of the African Academy of Sciences in 2001.

Zewail was made a Foreign Member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 2005, the Ahmed Zewail Award for Ultrafast Science and Technology was established by the American Chemical Society and the Newport Corporation in his honor. In 2010 the journal Chemical Physics Letters established the Ahmed Zewail Prize in Molecular Sciences. In May 2010, Zewail gave the commencement address at Southwestern University. The Zewail City of Science and Technology, established in 2000 and revived in 2011, is named in his honour.

<text>Stereolab are an Anglo-French avant-pop band formed in London in 1990. Led by the songwriting team of Tim Gane and Lætitia Sadier, the group&#x27;s sound features influences from krautrock and 1960s French pop music, often incorporating a repetitive motorik beat with the use of vintage electronic keyboards and female vocals sung in English and French. Their lyrics have political and philosophical themes influenced by the Surrealist and Situationist art movements. While performing, they play in a more feedback-driven and guitar-oriented style. From the mid-1990s, the band began to draw from funk, jazz and Brazilian music.

Stereolab were formed by Gane (guitar and keyboards) and Sadier (vocals, keyboards and guitar) after the break-up of McCarthy. The two were romantically involved for fourteen years and are the group&#x27;s only consistent members. Other longtime members included 1992 addition Mary Hansen (backing vocals, keyboards and guitar), who died in 2002, and 1993 addition Andy Ramsay (drums). The High Llamas&#x27; leader Sean O&#x27;Hagan (guitar and keyboards) was a member from 1993 to 1994 and continued appearing on later records for occasional guest appearances.

Throughout their career, Stereolab have achieved moderate commercial success. The band were released from their recording contract with Elektra Records, and their self-owned label Duophonic signed a distribution deal with Too Pure and later Warp Records. After a ten-year hiatus, the band reunited for live performances in 2019.

==History==

===1990–1993: Formation===

In 1985, Tim Gane formed McCarthy, a band from Essex, England, known for their left-wing politics. Gane met Lætitia Sadier, born in France, at a 1988 McCarthy concert in Paris and the two quickly fell in love. The musically inclined Sadier was disillusioned with the rock scene in France and soon moved to London to be with Gane and pursue her career. In 1990, after three albums, McCarthy broke up and Gane immediately formed Stereolab with Sadier (who had also contributed vocals to McCarthy&#x27;s final album), ex-Chills bassist Martin Kean and Gina Morris on backing vocals. Stereolab&#x27;s name was taken from a division of Vanguard Records demonstrating hi-fi effects.

Gane and Sadier, along with future band manager Martin Pike, set up a record label called Duophonic Super 45s which, along with later offshoot Duophonic Ultra High Frequency Disks, would become commonly known as &quot;Duophonic&quot;. Gane said that their &quot;original plan&quot; was to distribute multiple 7 and 10-inch records &quot;–to just do one a month and keep doing them in small editions&quot;. The 10 inch vinyl EP &quot;Super 45&quot;, released in May 1991, was the first release for both Stereolab and the label, and was sold through mail order and through the Rough Trade Shop in London. &quot;Super 45&quot;″s band-designed album art and packaging was the first of many customised and limited-edition Duophonic records. In a 1996 interview in &quot;The Wire&quot;, Gane calls the &quot;do-it-yourself&quot; aesthetic behind Duophonic &quot;empowering&quot;, and said that by releasing one&#x27;s own music &quot;you learn; it creates more music, more ideas&quot;.

Stereolab released the EP &quot;Super-Electric&quot; in September 1991, and a single, titled &quot;Stunning Debut Album&quot; (which was neither debut nor album), followed in November 1991. The early material was rock and guitar-oriented; of &quot;Super-Electric&quot; Jason Ankeny wrote in AllMusic that &quot;Droning guitars, skeletal rhythms, and pop hooks—not vintage synths and pointillist melodies—were their calling cards ...&quot; Under the independent label Too Pure, the group&#x27;s first full-length album, &quot;Peng!&quot;, was released in May 1992. A compilation titled &quot;Switched On&quot; was released in October 1992 and would be part of a series of compilations that anthologise the band&#x27;s more obscure material.

Around this time, the line-up consisted of Gane and Sadier plus vocalist and guitarist Mary Hansen, drummer Andy Ramsay, bassist Duncan Brown, and keyboardist Katharine Gifford. Hansen, born in Australia, had been in touch with Gane since his McCarthy days. After joining, she and Sadier developed a style of vocal counterpoint that distinguished Stereolab&#x27;s sound. Sean O&#x27;Hagan of the High Llamas joined as a quick replacement for their touring keyboardist, but was invited for their next record and &quot;was allowed to make suggestions&quot;.

===1993–2001: Sign to Elektra===
Stereolab introduced easy-listening elements into their sound with the EP &quot;Space Age Bachelor Pad Music&quot;, released in March 1993. The work raised the band&#x27;s profile and landed them a major-label American record deal with Elektra Records. Their first album under Elektra, &quot;Transient Random-Noise Bursts with Announcements&quot; (August 1993), was an underground success in both the US and the UK. Mark Jenkins commented in &quot;Washington Post&quot; that with the album, Stereolab &quot;continues the glorious drones of [their] indie work, giving celestial sweep to [their] garage-rock organ pumping and rhythm-guitar strumming&quot;. In the UK, the album was released on Duophonic Ultra High Frequency Disks, which is responsible for domestic releases of Stereolab&#x27;s major albums.

In January 1994, Stereolab achieved their first chart entry when the 1993 EP &quot;Jenny Ondioline&quot;, entered at number 75 on the UK Singles Chart. (Over the next three years, four more releases by the band would appear on this chart, ending with the EP &quot;Miss Modular&quot; in 1997.) Their third album, &quot;Mars Audiac Quintet&quot;, was released in August 1994. The album contains the single &quot;Ping Pong&quot;, which gained press coverage for its explicitly Marxist lyrics. The band focused more on pop and less on rock, resulting in what AllMusic described as &quot;what may be the group&#x27;s most accessible, tightly-written album&quot;. It was the last album to feature O&#x27;Hagan as a full-time member. He would continue to make guest appearances on later releases. The group issued an EP titled &quot;Music for the Amorphous Body Study Center&quot; in April 1995. The EP was their musical contribution to an interactive art exhibit put on in collaboration with New York City artist Charles Long. Their second compilation of rarities, titled &quot;Refried Ectoplasm (Switched On, Vol. 2)&quot;, was released in July 1995.

The band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Emperor Tomato Ketchup&quot; (March 1996), was a critical success and was played heavily on college radio. A record that &quot;captivated alternative rock&quot;, it represented the group&#x27;s &quot;high-water mark&quot; said music journalists Tom Moon and Joshua Klein, respectively. The album incorporated their early krautrock sound with funk, hip-hop influences and experimental instrumental arrangements. John McEntire of Tortoise also assisted with production and played on the album. Katharine Gifford was replaced by Morgane Lhote before recording, and bassist Duncan Brown by Richard Harrison after. Lhote was required to both learn the keyboards and 30 of the group&#x27;s songs before joining.

Released in September 1997, &quot;Dots and Loops&quot; was their first album to enter the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts, peaking at number 111. The album leaned towards jazz with bossa nova and 60&#x27;s pop influences. Barney Hoskyns wrote in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that with it the group moved &quot;ever further away from the one-chord Velvets drone-mesh of its early days&quot; toward easy-listening and Europop. A review in German newspaper &quot;Die Zeit&quot; stated that in &quot;Dots and Loops&quot;, Stereolab transformed the harder Velvet Underground-like riffs of previous releases into &quot;softer sounds and noisy playfulness&quot;. Contributors to the album included John McEntire and Jan St. Werner of German electropop duo Mouse on Mars. Stereolab toured for seven months and took a break when Gane and Sadier had a child. The group&#x27;s third compilation of rarities, &quot;Aluminum Tunes&quot;, was issued in October 1998.

Their sixth album, &quot;Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night&quot;, was released in September 1999. It was co-produced by McEntire and American producer Jim O&#x27;Rourke, and was recorded with their new bassist, Simon Johns. The album received middling reviews from critics and peaked at number 154 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. An unsigned &quot;NME&quot; review said that &quot;this record has far more in common with bad jazz and progressive rock than any experimental art-rock tradition.&quot; In a 1999 article of &quot;Washington Post&quot;, Mark Jenkins asked Gane about the album&#x27;s apparent lack of guitars; Gane responded, &quot;There&#x27;s a lot less upfront, distorted guitar ... But it&#x27;s still quite guitar-based music. Every single track has a guitar on it.&quot;

Stereolab&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;Sound-Dust&quot; (August 2001), rose to number 178 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album also featured producers McEntire and O&#x27;Rourke. &quot;Sound-Dust&quot; was more warmly received than &quot;Cobra and Phases Group…&quot;. Critic Joshua Klein said that &quot;the emphasis this time sounds less on unfocused experimentation and more on melody ... a breezy and welcome return to form for the British band.&quot; Erlewine of Allmusic stated that the album &quot;[finds the group] deliberately recharging their creative juices&quot; but he argued that &quot;Sound-Dust&quot; was &quot;anchored in overly familiar territory.&quot;

===2002–2008: Death of Hansen and later releases===
In 2002, as they were planning their next album, Stereolab started building a studio north of Bordeaux, France. &quot;ABC Music: The Radio 1 Sessions&quot;; a compilation of BBC Radio 1 sessions was released in October. In the same year, Gane and Sadier&#x27;s romantic relationship ended.

On 9 December 2002, Hansen was killed when hit by a truck while riding her bicycle in London. She was 36. Writer Pierre Perrone said that her &quot;playful nature and mischievous sense of humour came through in the way she approached the backing vocals she contributed to Stereolab and the distinctive harmonies she created with Sadier.&quot; For the next few months, Stereolab lay dormant as the members grieved. They eventually decided to continue. Future album and concert reviews would mention the effects of Hansen&#x27;s absence.

The EP &quot;Instant 0 in the Universe&quot; (October 2003) was recorded in France, and was Stereolab&#x27;s first release following Hansen&#x27;s death. Music journalist Jim DeRogatis said that the EP marked a return to their earlier, harder sound—&quot;free from the pseudo-funk moves and avant-garde tinkering that had been inspired by Chicago producer Jim O&#x27;Rourke&quot;.

Stereolab&#x27;s eighth album, &quot;Margerine Eclipse&quot;, was released on 27 January 2004 with generally positive reviews, and peaked at number 174 on the US Billboard 200. The track &quot;Feel and Triple&quot; was written in tribute to Hansen; Sadier said, &quot;I was reflecting on my years with her ... reflecting on how we sometimes found it hard to express the love we had for one another.&quot; Sadier continued, &quot;Our dedication to her on the album says, &#x27;We will love you till the end&#x27;, meaning of our lives. I&#x27;m not religious, but I feel Mary&#x27;s energy is still around somewhere. It didn&#x27;t just disappear.&quot; The &quot;Observer&quot;&#x27;s Molloy Woodcraft gave the album four out of five stars, and commented that Sadier&#x27;s vocal performance as &quot;life- and love-affirming&quot;, and the record as a whole as &quot;Complex and catchy, bold and beatific.&quot; Kelefa Sanneh commented in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that &quot;Margerine Eclipse&quot; was &quot;full of familiar noises and aimless melodies&quot;. &quot;Margerine Eclipse&quot; was Stereolab&#x27;s last record to be released on American label Elektra Records, which shut down that same year. Future material would be released on Too Pure, the same label which had released some of the band&#x27;s earliest material.

The group released six limited-edition singles in 2005 and 2006, which were anthologised in the 2006 compilation &quot;Fab Four Suture&quot;, and contained material which Mark Jenkins thought continued the brisker sound of the band&#x27;s post-Hansen work. By June 2007, Stereolab&#x27;s line-up comprised Tim Gane, Lætitia Sadier, Andy Ramsay, Simon Johns, Dominic Jeffrey, Joseph Watson, and Joseph Walters. In 2008, the band issued their next album under the label 4AD titled, &quot;Chemical Chords&quot;, which &quot;[downplays] their arsenal of analog synths in favor of live instrumentation&quot;. The release was followed by an autumn tour in Europe, the United States and Canada. 
In February 2009, they toured Australia as part of the St Jerome&#x27;s Laneway Festival.

===2009–present: Hiatus and reunion===
In April 2009, Stereolab manager Martin Pike announced a pause in their activities for the time being. He said that it was an opportune time for the members to move on to other projects. &quot;Not Music&quot;, a collection of unreleased material recorded at the same time as &quot;Chemical Chords&quot;, was released in 2010. In 2013, Gane and Sadier, who both focused on Cavern of Anti-Matter and solo work respectively, performed at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival held at Pontins in Camber Sands.

In February 2019, the group announced a tour of Europe and the United States to coincide with expanded, remastered reissues of several of the albums released under Warp Records. Stereolab were part of the lineup for 2019&#x27;s Primavera Sound festival, taking part on the weekend of 30 May in Barcelona, Spain, and the following weekend in Porto, Portugal. It was the group&#x27;s first live performance since 2009.

==Musical style==

Stereolab&#x27;s music combines a droning rock sound with lounge instrumentals, overlaid with sing-song female vocals and pop melodies, and has also made use of unorthodox time signatures. It has been generally described as avant-pop, indie pop, art pop, indie electronic, indie rock, post-rock, experimental rock, and experimental pop. Sadier remarked in 2015 that &quot;[the band&#x27;s] records were written and recorded very quickly… we would write 35 tracks, sometimes more&quot;.

The band have played on vintage electronic keyboards and synthesizers from brands such as Farfisa and Vox and Moog. Gane has praised the instruments for their versatility: &quot;We use the older effects because they&#x27;re more direct, more extreme, and they&#x27;re more like plasticine: you can shape them into loads of things.&quot; The 1994 album &quot;Mars Audiac Quintet&quot; prominently features Moog synthesizers.

Lætitia Sadier&#x27;s English and French vocals have been a part of Stereolab&#x27;s music since the beginning, and she would occasionally sing wordlessly along with the music. In reference to her laid-back delivery, Peter Shapiro wrote facetiously in &quot;Wire&quot; that Sadier &quot;display[ed] all the emotional histrionics of Nico&quot;, while some critics have commented that her vocals were unintelligible. Sadier would often trade vocals with Mary Hansen back-and-forth in a sing-song manner that has been described as &quot;eerie&quot; and &quot;hypnotic&quot;, as well as &quot;sweet [and] slightly alien&quot;. After Hansen&#x27;s death in 2002, critic Jim Harrington commented that her absence is noticeable on live performances of Stereolab&#x27;s older tracks, and that their newer songs could have benefited from Hansen&#x27;s backing vocals.

In interviews, Gane and Sadier have discussed their musical philosophy. Gane said that &quot;to be unique was more important than to be good.&quot; On the subject of being too obscure, he said in a 1996 interview that &quot;maybe the area where we&#x27;re on dodgy ground, is this idea that you need great knowledge [of] esoteric music to understand what we&#x27;re doing.&quot; Sadier responded to Gane, saying that she &quot;think[s] we have achieved a music that will make sense to a lot of people whether they know about Steve Reich or not.&quot; The duo were up-front about their desire to grow their sound: for Gane, &quot;otherwise it just sounds like what other people are doing&quot;, and for Sadier, &quot;you trust that there is more and that it can be done more interesting.&quot;

===Influences===

Their records have been heavily influenced by the &quot;motorik&quot; technique of 1970s krautrock groups such as Neu! and Faust. Tim Gane has supported the comparison: &quot;Neu! did minimalism and drones, but in a very pop way.&quot; Dave Heaton of &quot;PopMatters&quot; said that their music also had &quot;echoes of bubblegum, of exotica, of Beach Boys and bossa nova&quot;, with their earlier work &quot;bearing strong Velvet Underground overtones&quot;. Funk, jazz, and Brazilian music were additional inspirations for the band. Stephan Davet of French newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot; said that &quot;Emperor Tomato Ketchup&quot; (1996) had musical influences such as Burt Bacharach, and Françoise Hardy. The sounds influenced by minimalist composers Philip Glass and Steve Reich can be found on the 1999 album &quot;Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night.&quot; Stereolab&#x27;s style also incorporates easy-listening music of the 1950s and &#x27;60s. Joshua Klein in &quot;Washington Post&quot; said that, &quot;Years before everyone else caught on, Stereolab [were] referencing the 1970s German bands Can and Neu!, the Mexican lounge music master Esquivel and the decidedly unhip Burt Bacharach.&quot; Regarding their later work such as &quot;Instant 0 in the Universe&quot; (2003) and &quot;Margerine Eclipse&quot; (2004), critics have compared the releases to the band&#x27;s earlier guitar-driven style.

===Live performances===
Stereolab toured regularly to support their album releases. In a 1996 &quot;Washington Post&quot; gig review, Mark Jenkins wrote that Stereolab started out favouring an &quot;easy-listening syncopation&quot;, but eventually reverted to a &quot;messier, more urgent sound&quot; characteristic of their earlier performances. In another review Jenkins said that the band&#x27;s live songs &quot;frequently veer[ed] into more cacophonous, guitar-dominated territory&quot;, in contrast to their albums such as &quot;Cobra and Phases Group…&quot; In the &quot;Minneapolis Star Tribune&quot;, Jon Bream compared the band&#x27;s live sound to feedback-driven rock bands like the Velvet Underground, Sonic Youth and My Bloody Valentine. Jim Harrington of &quot;The Oakland Tribune&quot; argued that &quot;Sadier often sounded like a third percussion instrument more than a lead vocalist&quot;, further stating in regard to her switching between singing in English and French that &quot;a Stereolab show is one of the few concerts where it&#x27;s hard to find even the biggest fans mouthing along with the lyrics.&quot; Regarding being onstage, Gane has said that &quot;I don&#x27;t like to be the center of attention ... I just get into the music and am not really aware of the people there. That&#x27;s my way of getting through it.&quot; Remarking of the band&#x27;s 2019 reunion tour, he added that &quot;[Stereolab] never were really a festival band&quot;…&quot; We&#x27;re not like, &#x27;Hey, how you all doing?&#x27; and all that stuff.&quot;

==Lyrics and titles==
Stereolab&#x27;s music is politically and philosophically charged. Dave Heaton of &quot;PopMatters&quot; said that the group &quot;[uses] lyrics to convey ideas while using them for the pleasurable way the words sound.&quot; Lætitia Sadier, who writes the group&#x27;s lyrics, was influenced by both the Situationist philosophy &quot;Society of the Spectacle&quot; by Marxist theorist Guy Debord, and her anger towards the Iraq War. The Surrealist, as well as other Situationist cultural and political movements were also influences, as stated by Sadier and Gane in a 1999 &quot;Salon&quot; interview.

Critics have seen Marxist allusions in the band&#x27;s lyrics, and have gone so far as to call the band members themselves Marxist. Music journalist Simon Reynolds commented that Sadier&#x27;s lyrics tend to lean towards Marxist social commentary rather than &quot;affairs of the heart&quot;. The 1994 single &quot;Ping Pong&quot; has been put forward as evidence in regard to these alleged views. In the song, Sadier sings &quot;about capitalism&#x27;s cruel cycles of slump and recovery&quot; with lyrics that constitute &quot;a plainspoken explanation of one of the central tenets of Marxian economic analysis&quot; (said critics Reynolds and Stewart Mason, respectively).

Band members have resisted attempts to link the group and its music to Marxism. In a 1999 interview, Gane stated that &quot;none of us are Marxists ... I&#x27;ve never even read Marx.&quot; Gane said that although Sadier&#x27;s lyrics touch on political topics, they do not cross the line into &quot;sloganeering&quot;. Sadier also said that she had read very little Marx. In contrast, Cornelius Castoriadis, a radical political philosopher but strong critic of Marxism, has been cited as a marking influence in Sadier&#x27;s thinking. The name of her side project, Monade, and its debut album title, &quot;Socialisme ou Barbarie&quot;, are also references to the work of Castoriadis.

Stereolab&#x27;s album and song titles occasionally reference avant-garde groups and artists. Gane said that the title of their 1999 album &quot;Cobra and Phases Group…&quot; contains the names of two Surrealist organisations, &quot;CoBrA&quot; and &quot;Phases Group&quot;, The title of the song &quot;Brakhage&quot; from &quot;Dots and Loops&quot; (1997), is a nod to experimental filmmaker Stan Brakhage. Other examples are the 1992 compilation &quot;Switched On&quot;, named after Wendy Carlos&#x27; 1968 album &quot;Switched-On Bach&quot;, and the 1993 song &quot;Jenny Ondioline&quot;, a portmanteau of inventor Georges Jenny and his instrument the Ondioline.

==Legacy==
Stereolab have been called one of the most &quot;influential&quot; and &quot;fiercely independent and original groups of the Nineties&quot; by writers Stephen Thomas Erlewine and Pierre Perrone respectively; as well as one of &quot;the decade&#x27;s most innovative British bands.&quot; by Mark Jenkins. Simon Reynolds commented in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that the group&#x27;s earlier records form &quot;an endlessly seductive body of work that sounds always the same, always different.&quot; In a review for the 1992 single &quot;John Cage Bubblegum&quot;, Jason Ankeny said that &quot;No other artist of its generation fused the high-minded daring of the avant-garde and the lowbrow infectiousness of pop with as much invention, skill, and appeal.&quot; In &quot;The Wire&quot;, Peter Shapiro compared the band to Britpop bands Oasis and Blur, and defended their music against the charge that it is &quot;nothing but the sum total of its arcane reference points.&quot; They were one of the first groups to be termed post-rock—in a 1996 article, journalist Angela Lewis applied the &quot;new term&quot; to Stereolab and three other bands who have connections to the group. Stylistically, music journalist J. D. Considine credits the band for anticipating and driving the late 1990s revival of vintage analogue instruments among indie rock bands. Stephen Christian, a creative director of Warp Records, said that the group &quot;exists in the gap between the experimentation of the underground and the appeal of the wider world of pop music&quot;.

The group have also received negative press. Barney Hoskyns questioned the longevity of their music in a 1996 &quot;Mojo&quot; review, saying that their records &quot;sound more like arid experiments than music born of emotional need.&quot; In &quot;Guardian,&quot; Dave Simpson stated: &quot;With their borrowings from early, obscure Kraftwerk and hip obtuse sources, [Stereolab] sound like a band of rock critics rather than musicians.&quot; Lætitia Sadier&#x27;s vocals were cited by author Stuart Shea as often being &quot;indecipherable&quot;.

A variety of artists, musical and otherwise, have collaborated with Stereolab. In 1995 the group teamed up with sculptor Charles Long for an interactive art show in New York City, for which Long provided the exhibits and Stereolab the music. They have released tracks by and toured with post-rock band Tortoise, while John McEntire of Tortoise has in turn worked on several Stereolab albums. In the 1990s, the group collaborated with the industrial band Nurse With Wound and released two albums together, &quot;Crumb Duck&quot; (1993) and &quot;Simple Headphone Mind&quot; (1998), and Stereolab also released &quot;Calimero&quot; (1998) with French avant-garde singer and poet Brigitte Fontaine. The band worked with Herbie Mann on the song &quot;One Note Samba/Surfboard&quot; for the 1998 AIDS-Benefit album, &quot;Red Hot + Rio&quot;, produced by the Red Hot Organization.

Stereolab alumni have also founded bands of their own. Guitarist Tim Gane founded the side project Cavern of Anti-Matter and also formed Turn on alongside band member Sean O&#x27;Hagan, who formed his own band the High Llamas. Katharine Gifford formed Snowpony with former My Bloody Valentine bassist Debbie Googe. Sadier has released three albums with her four-piece side-project Monade, whose sound Mark Jenkins called a &quot;little more Parisian&quot; than Stereolab&#x27;s. Backing vocalist Mary Hansen formed a band named Schema with members of Hovercraft and released their eponymous EP in 2000.

As of August 1999, US album sales stood at 300,000 copies sold. Despite receiving critical acclaim and a sizeable fanbase, commercial success eluded the group. Early in their career, their 1993 EP &quot;Jenny Ondioline&quot; entered the UK Singles Chart, but financial issues prevented the band from printing enough records to satisfy demand. According to Sadier, however, the band &quot;[avoided] going overground&quot; like PJ Harvey, Pulp and the Cranberries, all of whom quickly rose from obscurity to fame, adding: &quot;This kind of notoriety is not a particularly good thing, [and] you don&#x27;t enjoy it anymore.&quot; When Elektra Records was closed down by Warner Bros. Records in 2004, Stereolab was dropped along with many other artists, reportedly because of poor sales. Tim Gane said in retrospect that the group &quot;signed to Elektra because we thought we would be on there for an album or two and then we&#x27;d get ejected. We were surprised when we got to our first album!&quot; Since then, Stereolab&#x27;s self-owned label Duophonic has inked a worldwide distribution deal with independent label Too Pure. Through Duophonic, the band both licenses their music and releases it directly (depending on geographic market). Gane said, &quot;... we license our recordings and just give them to people, then we don&#x27;t have to ask for permission if we want to use it. We just want to be in control of our own music.&quot;

<doc id="113620" wikidata="Q815523" url="?curid=113620" title="Mabinogion">
<text>The Mabinogion () is a collection of the earliest Welsh prose stories, compiled in Middle Welsh in the 12th–13th centuries from earlier oral traditions. There are two main source manuscripts, created –1410, as well as a few earlier fragments. Often included in the broader mythologies described as the Matter of Britain, the Mabinogion consists of eleven stories of widely different types, offering drama, philosophy, romance, tragedy, fantasy and humour. 
Strictly speaking, the Four Branches of the Mabinogi are the main sequence of related tales, but seven others include a classic hero quest, &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;; a historic legend, complete with glimpses of a far off age, in &quot;Lludd and Llefelys&quot;; and other tales portraying a very different King Arthur from the later popular versions.

The stories were created and amended by various narrators over a very long period of time, and scholars beginning from the 18th century predominantly viewed the tales as fragmentary pre-Christian Celtic mythology, or folklore. Since the 1970s, an investigation of the common plot structures, characterisation, and language styles, especially in the Four Branches of the Mabinogi, has led to an understanding of the integrity of the tales, and they are now seen as a sophisticated narrative tradition, both oral and written, with ancestral construction from oral storytelling, and overlay from Anglo-French influences.

The first modern publications of the stories were English translations by William Owen Pughe of several tales in journals in 1795, 1821, and 1829, which introduced usage of the name &quot;Mabinogion&quot;. In 1838–45, Lady Charlotte Guest first published the full collection we know today, bilingually in Welsh and English, which popularised the name. The later Guest translation of 1877 in one volume has been widely influential and remains actively read today.
The most recent translation is a compact version by Sioned Davies. John Bollard has published a series of volumes with his own translation, with copious photography of the sites in the stories. The tales continue to inspire new fiction, dramatic retellings, visual artwork, music and research, from early reinterpretations by Evangeline Walton in 1936, to J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, to the 1975 song &quot;Rhiannon&quot; by Fleetwood Mac, to the 2009–2014 series of books commissioned by Welsh independent publisher Seren Books.

==Etymology==
The name first appears in 1795 in William Owen Pughe&#x27;s translation of &quot;Pwyll&quot; in the journal &quot;Cambrian Register&quot; under the title &quot;The Mabinogion, or Juvenile Amusements, being Ancient Welsh Romances&quot;. The name appears to have been current among Welsh scholars of the London-Welsh Societies and the regional eisteddfodau in Wales. It was inherited as the title by the first publisher of the complete collection, Lady Charlotte Guest.

The form &quot;mabynnogyon&quot; occurs once at the end of the first of the &quot;Four Branches of the Mabinogi&quot; in one manuscript. It is now generally agreed that this one instance was a mediaeval scribal error which assumed &#x27;mabinogion&#x27; was the plural of &#x27;mabinogi&#x27;, which is already a Welsh plural occurring correctly at the end of the remaining three branches.

The word &quot;mabinogi&quot; itself is something of a puzzle, although clearly derived from the Welsh &quot;mab&quot;, which means &quot;son, boy, young person&quot;. As early as 1632 the lexicographer John Davies quotes a sentence from &quot;Math fab Mathonwy&quot; with the notation &quot;Mabin&quot; in his &quot;Antiquae linguae Britannicae ... dictionarium duplex&quot;, article &quot;Hob&quot;. Eric P. Hamp, of the earlier school traditions in mythology, found a suggestive connection with Maponos, &quot;the Divine Son&quot;, a Gaulish deity.

Sioned Davies suggests the title &quot;Mabinogi&quot; properly applies only to the Four Branches, which is a tightly organised quartet very likely by one author, where the other seven stories are very diverse. Each of these four tales ends with the colophon &quot;thus ends this branch of the Mabinogi&quot; (in various spellings), hence the name.

==Translations==

Lady Charlotte Guest&#x27;s work was helped by the earlier research and translation work of William Owen Pughe. The first part of Charlotte Guest&#x27;s translation of the Mabinogion appeared in 1838, and it was completed in seven parts in 1845. A three-volume edition followed in 1846, and a revised edition in 1877. Her version of the &quot;Mabinogion&quot; was the most frequently used English version until the 1948 translation by Gwyn Jones and Thomas Jones, which has been widely praised for its combination of literal accuracy and elegant literary style. Several more, listed below, have since appeared.

==Date of stories==

Dates for the tales in the &quot;Mabinogion&quot; have been much debated, a range from 1050 to 1225 being proposed, with the consensus being that they are to be dated to the late 11th and 12th centuries. The stories of the &quot;Mabinogion&quot; appear in either or both of two medieval Welsh manuscripts, the White Book of Rhydderch or &quot;Llyfr Gwyn Rhydderch&quot;, written , and the Red Book of Hergest or &quot;Llyfr Coch Hergest&quot;, written about 1382–1410, though texts or fragments of some of the tales have been preserved in earlier 13th century and later manuscripts. Scholars agree that the tales are older than the existing manuscripts, but disagree over just how much older. It is clear that the different texts included in the &quot;Mabinogion&quot; originated at different times (though regardless their importance as records of early myth, legend, folklore, culture, and language of Wales remains immense).

Thus the tale of Culhwch ac Olwen, with its primitive warlord Arthur and his court based at Celliwig, is generally accepted to precede the Arthurian romances, which themselves show the influence of Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s (1134–36) and the romances of Chrétien de Troyes. Those following R. S. Loomis would date it before 1100, and see it as providing important evidence for the development of Arthurian legend, with links to Nennius and early Welsh poetry. 
By contrast, The Dream of Rhonabwy is set in the reign of the historical Madog ap Maredudd (1130–60), and must therefore either be contemporary with or postdate his reign, being perhaps early 13th C.

Much debate has been focused on the dating of the &quot;Four Branches of the Mabinogi&quot;. Ifor Williams offered a date prior to 1100, based on linguistic and historical arguments, while later Saunders Lewis set forth a number of arguments for a date between 1170 and 1190; Thomas Charles-Edwards, in a paper published in 1970, discussed the strengths and weaknesses of both viewpoints, and while critical of the arguments of both scholars, noted that the language of the stories best fits the 11th century, (specifically 1050–1120), although much more work is needed. In 1991, Patrick Sims-Williams argued for a plausible range of about 1060 to 1200, which seems to be the current scholarly consensus (fitting all the previously suggested date ranges).

==Stories==
The collection represents the vast majority of prose found in medieval Welsh manuscripts which is not translated from other languages. Notable exceptions are the &quot;Areithiau Pros&quot;. None of the titles are contemporary with the earliest extant versions of the stories, but are on the whole modern ascriptions. The eleven tales are not adjacent in either of the main early manuscript sources, the White Book of Rhydderch () and the Red Book of Hergest (), and indeed &quot;Breuddwyd Rhonabwy&quot; is absent from the White Book.

===Four Branches of the &quot;Mabinogi&quot;===
The Four Branches of the &quot;Mabinogi&quot; (&quot;Pedair Cainc y Mabinogi&quot;) are the most clearly mythological stories contained in the &quot;Mabinogion&quot; collection. Pryderi appears in all four, though not always as the central character.

* &quot;Pwyll Pendefig Dyfed&quot; (&quot;Pwyll, Prince of Dyfed&quot;) tells of Pryderi&#x27;s parents and his birth, loss and recovery.
* &quot;Branwen ferch Llŷr&quot; (&quot;Branwen, daughter of Llŷr&quot;) is mostly about Branwen&#x27;s marriage to the King of Ireland. Pryderi appears but does not play a major part.
* &quot;Manawydan fab Llŷr&quot; (&quot;Manawydan, son of Llŷr&quot;) has Pryderi return home with Manawydan, brother of Branwen, and describes the misfortunes that follow them there.
* &quot;Math fab Mathonwy&quot; (&quot;Math, son of Mathonwy&quot;) is mostly about the eponymous Math and Gwydion, who come into conflict with Pryderi.

===Native tales===
Also included in Guest&#x27;s compilation are five stories from Welsh tradition and legend:
* &quot;Breuddwyd Macsen Wledig&quot; (&quot;The Dream of Macsen Wledig&quot;)
* &quot;Lludd a Llefelys&quot; (&quot;Lludd and Llefelys&quot;)
* &quot;Culhwch ac Olwen&quot; (&quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot;)
* &quot;Breuddwyd Rhonabwy&quot; (&quot;The Dream of Rhonabwy&quot;)
* &quot;Hanes Taliesin&quot; (&quot;The History of Taliesin&quot;)

The tales &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot; and &quot;The Dream of Rhonabwy&quot; have interested scholars because they preserve older traditions of King Arthur. The subject matter and the characters described events that happened long before medieval times. After the departure of the Roman Legions, the later half of the 5th century was a difficult time in Britain. King Arthur&#x27;s twelve battles and defeat of invaders and raiders are said to have culminated in the Battle of Badon.

There is no consensus about the ultimate meaning of &quot;The Dream of Rhonabwy&quot;. On one hand it derides Madoc&#x27;s time, which is critically compared to the illustrious Arthurian age. However, Arthur&#x27;s time is portrayed as illogical and silly, leading to suggestions that this is a satire on both contemporary times and the myth of a heroic age.

&quot;Rhonabwy&quot; is the most literary of the medieval Welsh prose tales. It may have also been the last written. A colophon at the end declares that no one is able to recite the work in full without a book, the level of detail being too much for the memory to handle. The comment suggests it was not popular with storytellers, though this was more likely due to its position as a literary tale rather than a traditional one.

The tale &quot;The Dream of Macsen Wledig&quot; is a romanticised story about the Roman emperor Magnus Maximus, called &quot;Macsen Wledig&quot; in Welsh. Born in Hispania, he became a legionary commander in Britain, assembled a Celtic army and assumed the title of Roman Emperor in 383. He was defeated in battle in 385 and beheaded at the direction of the Eastern Roman emperor.

The story of Taliesin is a later survival, not present in the Red or White Books, and is omitted from many of the more recent translations.

===Romances===
The tales called the &quot;Three Welsh Romances&quot; (&quot;Y Tair Rhamant&quot;) are Welsh-language versions of Arthurian tales that also appear in the work of Chrétien de Troyes. Critics have debated whether the Welsh Romances are based on Chrétien&#x27;s poems or if they derive from a shared original. Though it is arguable that the surviving Romances might derive, directly or indirectly, from Chrétien, it is probable that he in turn based his tales on older, Celtic sources. The Welsh stories are not direct translations and include material not found in Chrétien&#x27;s work.

* &quot;Owain, neu Iarlles y Ffynnon&quot; (&quot;Owain, or the Countess&quot; (or &quot;Lady&quot;) &quot;of the Fountain&quot;)
* &quot;Peredur fab Efrog&quot; (&quot;Peredur son of Efrawg&quot;)
* &quot;Geraint ac Enid&quot; (&quot;Geraint and Enid&quot;)

==Influence on later works==

* Kenneth Morris, himself a Welshman, pioneered the adaptation of the &quot;Mabinogion&quot; with &quot;The Fates of the Princes of Dyfed&quot; (1914) and &quot;Book of the Three Dragons&quot; (1930).
*Evangeline Walton adapted the &quot;Mabinogion&quot; in the novels &quot;The Island of the Mighty&quot; (1936), &quot;The Children of Llyr&quot; (1971), &quot;The Song of Rhiannon&quot; (1972) and &quot;Prince of Annwn&quot; (1974), each one of which she based on one of the branches, although she began with the fourth and ended by telling the first. These were published together in chronological sequence as &quot;The Mabinogion Tetralogy&quot; in 2002.
* &quot;Y Mabinogi&quot; is a film version, produced in 2003. It starts with live action among Welsh people in the modern world. They then &#x27;fall into&#x27; the legend, which is shown through animated characters. It conflates some elements of the myths and omits others. 
* The tale of &quot;Culhwch and Olwen&quot; was adapted by Derek Webb in Welsh and English as a dramatic recreation for the reopening of Narberth Castle in Pembrokeshire in 2005.
*Lloyd Alexander&#x27;s award-winning &quot;The Chronicles of Prydain&quot; fantasy novels for younger readers are loosely based on Welsh legends found in the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;. Specific elements incorporated within Alexander&#x27;s books include the Cauldron of the Undead, as well as adapted versions of important figures in the &quot;Mabinogion&quot; such as Prince Gwydion and Arawn, Lord of the Dead.
*Alan Garner&#x27;s novel &quot;The Owl Service&quot; (Collins, 1967; first US edition Henry Z. Walck, 1968) alludes to the mythical Blodeuwedd featured in the Fourth Branch of the &quot;Mabinogi&quot;. In Garner&#x27;s tale three teenagers find themselves re-enacting the story. They awaken the legend by finding a set of dinner plates (a &quot;dinner service&quot;) with an owl pattern, which gives the novel its title.
*The Welsh mythology of &quot;The Mabinogion&quot;, especially the &quot;Four Branches of the Mabinogi&quot;, is important in John Cowper Powys&#x27;s novels &quot;Owen Glendower&quot; (1941), and &quot;&quot; (1951). Jeremy Hooker sees &quot;The Mabinogion&quot; as having &quot;a significant presence […] through character&#x27;s knowledge of its stories and identification of themselves or others with figures or incidents in the stories&quot;. Indeed, there are &quot;almost fifty allusions to these four […] tales&quot;&#x27; (The &quot;Four Branches of the Mabinogi&quot;) in the novel, though &quot;some ... are fairly obscure and inconspicuous&quot;. Also in &quot;Porius&quot; Powys creates the character Sylvannus Bleheris, Henog of Dyfed, author of &quot;the Four Pre-Arthurian Branches of the Mabinogi&quot; concerned with Pryderi, as a way linking the mythological background of &quot;Porius&quot; with this aspect of the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;.
*J. R. R. Tolkien worked on a translation of &quot;Pwyll Prince of Dyfed&quot;, held at the Bodleian Library, and his entire legendarium was influenced by existing mythologies including the &quot;Mabinogion&quot;, reflected in his choice of the term &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; as a title for his collection of ancestral tales. The title of his Red Book of Westmarch echoes the Mabinogion&#x27;s Red Book of Hergest.

<text>A graphics card (also called a video card, display card, graphics accelerator, graphics adapter, VGA card/VGA, video adapter, display adapter, or colloquially GPU) is a computer expansion card that generates a feed of graphics output to a display device such as a monitor. Graphics cards are sometimes called &quot;discrete&quot; or &quot;dedicated&quot; graphics cards to emphasize their distinction to an integrated graphics processor on the motherboard or the central processing unit (CPU). A graphics processing unit (GPU) that performs the necessary computations is the main component in a graphics card, but the acronym &quot;GPU&quot; is sometimes also used to erroneously refer to the graphics card as a whole.

Most graphics cards are not limited to simple display output. The graphics processing unit can be used for additional processing, which reduces the load from the CPU. Additionally, computing platforms such as OpenCL and CUDA allow using graphics cards for general-purpose computing. Applications of general-purpose computing on graphics cards include AI training, cryptocurrency mining, and molecular simulation.

Usually, a &quot;graphics card&quot; comes in the form of a printed circuit board (expansion board) which is to be inserted into an expansion slot. Others may have dedicated enclosures, and they are connected to the computer via a docking station or a cable. These are known as external GPUs (eGPUs).

Graphics cards are often preferred over integrated graphics for increased performance. A more powerful graphics card will be able to render more frames per second.

== History ==

Graphics cards, also known as video cards or graphics processing units (GPUs), have historically evolved alongside computer display standards to accommodate advancing technologies and user demands. In the realm of IBM PC compatibles, the early standards included Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA), Color Graphics Adapter (CGA), Hercules Graphics Card, Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA), and Video Graphics Array (VGA). Each of these standards represented a step forward in the ability of computers to display more colors, higher resolutions, and richer graphical interfaces, laying the foundation for the development of modern graphical capabilities.

In the late 1980s, advancements in personal computing led companies like Radius to develop specialized graphics cards for the Apple Macintosh II. These cards were unique in that they incorporated discrete 2D QuickDraw capabilities, enhancing the graphical output of Macintosh computers by accelerating 2D graphics rendering. QuickDraw, a core part of the Macintosh graphical user interface, allowed for the rapid rendering of bitmapped graphics, fonts, and shapes, and the introduction of such hardware-based enhancements signaled an era of specialized graphics processing in consumer machines.

The evolution of graphics processing took a major leap forward in the mid-1990s with 3dfx Interactive&#x27;s introduction of the Voodoo series, one of the earliest consumer-facing GPUs that supported 3D acceleration. These cards, however, were dedicated entirely to 3D processing and lacked 2D support, necessitating the use of a separate 2D graphics card in tandem. The Voodoo&#x27;s architecture marked a major shift in graphical computing by offloading the demanding task of 3D rendering from the CPU to the GPU, significantly improving gaming performance and graphical realism.

The development of fully integrated GPUs that could handle both 2D and 3D rendering came with the introduction of the NVIDIA RIVA 128. Released in 1997, the RIVA 128 was one of the first consumer-facing GPUs to integrate both 3D and 2D processing units on a single chip. This innovation simplified the hardware requirements for end-users, as they no longer needed separate cards for 2D and 3D rendering, thus paving the way for the widespread adoption of more powerful and versatile GPUs in personal computers.

In contemporary times, the majority of graphics cards are built using chips sourced from two dominant manufacturers: AMD and Nvidia. These modern graphics cards are multifunctional and support various tasks beyond rendering 3D images for gaming. They also provide 2D graphics processing, video decoding, TV output, and multi-monitor setups. Additionally, many graphics cards now have integrated sound capabilities, allowing them to transmit audio alongside video output to connected TVs or monitors with built-in speakers, further enhancing the multimedia experience.

Within the graphics industry, these products are often referred to as graphics add-in boards (AIBs). The term &quot;AIB&quot; emphasizes the modular nature of these components, as they are typically added to a computer&#x27;s motherboard to enhance its graphical capabilities. The evolution from the early days of separate 2D and 3D cards to today&#x27;s integrated and multifunctional GPUs reflects the ongoing technological advancements and the increasing demand for high-quality visual and multimedia experiences in computing.

== Discrete vs integrated graphics ==

As an alternative to the use of a graphics card, video hardware can be integrated into the motherboard, CPU, or a system-on-chip as integrated graphics. Motherboard-based implementations are sometimes called &quot;on-board video&quot;. Some motherboards support using both integrated graphics and the graphics card simultaneously to feed separate displays. The main advantages of integrated graphics are: a low cost, compactness, simplicity, and low energy consumption. Integrated graphics often have less performance than a graphics card because the graphics processing unit inside integrated graphics needs to share system resources with the CPU. On the other hand, a graphics card has a separate random access memory (RAM), cooling system, and dedicated power regulators. A graphics card can offload work and reduce memory-bus-contention from the CPU and system RAM, therefore the overall performance for a computer could improve in addition to increased performance in graphics processing. Such improvements to performance can be seen in video gaming, 3D animation, and video editing.

Both AMD and Intel have introduced CPUs and motherboard chipsets which support the integration of a GPU into the same die as the CPU. AMD advertises CPUs with integrated graphics under the trademark Accelerated Processing Unit (APU), while Intel brands similar technology under &quot;Intel Graphics Technology&quot;.

== Power demand ==
As the processing power of graphics cards increased, so did their demand for electrical power. Current high-performance graphics cards tend to consume large amounts of power. For example, the thermal design power (TDP) for the GeForce Titan RTX is 280 watts. When tested with video games, the GeForce RTX 2080 Ti Founder&#x27;s Edition averaged 300 watts of power consumption. While CPU and power supply manufacturers have recently aimed toward higher efficiency, power demands of graphics cards continued to rise, with the largest power consumption of any individual part in a computer. Although power supplies have also increased their power output, the bottleneck occurs in the PCI-Express connection, which is limited to supplying 75 watts.

Modern graphics cards with a power consumption of over 75 watts usually include a combination of six-pin (75 W) or eight-pin (150 W) sockets that connect directly to the power supply. Providing adequate cooling becomes a challenge in such computers. Computers with multiple graphics cards may require power supplies over 750 watts. Heat extraction becomes a major design consideration for computers with two or more high-end graphics cards.

As of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 30 series, Ampere architecture, a custom flashed RTX 3090 named &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; has been recorded to reach a peak power draw as high as 630 watts. A standard RTX 3090 can peak at up to 450 watts. The RTX 3080 can reach up to 350 watts, while a 3070 can reach a similar, if not slightly lower peak power draw. Ampere cards of the Founders Edition variant feature a &quot;dual axial flow through&quot; cooler design, which includes fans above and below the card to dissipate as much heat as possible towards the rear of the computer case. A similar design was used by the Sapphire Radeon RX Vega 56 Pulse graphics card.

== Size ==
Graphics cards for desktop computers have different size profiles, which allows graphics cards to be added to smaller-sized computers. Some graphics cards are not of the usual size, and are named as &quot;low profile&quot;. Graphics card profiles are based on height only, with low-profile cards taking up less than the height of a PCIe slot, some can be as low as &quot;half-height&quot;. Length and thickness can vary greatly, with high-end cards usually occupying two or three expansion slots, and with modern high-end graphics cards such as the RTX 4090 exceeding 300mm in length. A lower profile card is preferred when trying to fit multiple cards or if graphics cards run into clearance issues with other motherboard components like the DIMM or PCIE slots. This can be fixed with a larger computer case such as mid-tower or full tower. Full towers are usually able to fit larger motherboards in sizes like ATX and micro ATX.

=== GPU sag ===
In the late 2010s and early 2020s, some high-end graphics card models have become so heavy that it is possible for them to sag downwards after installing without proper support, which is why many manufacturers provide additional support brackets. GPU sag can damage a GPU in the long term.

== Multicard scaling ==
Some graphics cards can be linked together to allow scaling graphics processing across multiple cards. This is done using either the PCIe bus on the motherboard or, more commonly, a data bridge. Usually, the cards must be of the same model to be linked, and most low end cards are not able to be linked in this way. AMD and Nvidia both have proprietary scaling methods, CrossFireX for AMD, and SLI (since the Turing generation, superseded by NVLink) for Nvidia. Cards from different chip-set manufacturers or architectures cannot be used together for multi-card scaling. If graphics cards have different sizes of memory, the lowest value will be used, with the higher values disregarded. Currently, scaling on consumer-grade cards can be done using up to four cards. The use of four cards requires a large motherboard with a proper configuration. Nvidia&#x27;s GeForce GTX 590 graphics card can be configured in a four-card configuration. As stated above, users will want to stick to cards with the same performances for optimal use. Motherboards including ASUS Maximus 3 Extreme and Gigabyte GA EX58 Extreme are certified to work with this configuration. A large power supply is necessary to run the cards in SLI or CrossFireX. Power demands must be known before a proper supply is installed. For the four card configuration, a 1000+ watt supply is needed. With any relatively powerful graphics card, thermal management cannot be ignored. Graphics cards require well-vented chassis and good thermal solutions. Air or water cooling are usually required, though low end GPUs can use passive cooling. Larger configurations use water solutions or immersion cooling to achieve proper performance without thermal throttling.

SLI and Crossfire have become increasingly uncommon as most games do not fully utilize multiple GPUs, due to the fact that most users cannot afford them. Multiple GPUs are still used on supercomputers (like in Summit), on workstations to accelerate video and 3D rendering, visual effects, for simulations, and for training artificial intelligence.

== 3D graphics APIs ==
A graphics driver usually supports one or multiple cards by the same vendor and has to be written for a specific operating system. Additionally, the operating system or an extra software package may provide certain programming APIs for applications to perform 3D rendering.

== Industry ==
As of 2016, the primary suppliers of the GPUs (graphics chips or chipsets) used in graphics cards are AMD and Nvidia. In the third quarter of 2013, AMD had a 35.5% market share while Nvidia had 64.5%, according to Jon Peddie Research. In economics, this industry structure is termed a duopoly. AMD and Nvidia also build and sell graphics cards, which are termed graphics add-in-boards (AIBs) in the industry. (See Comparison of Nvidia graphics processing units and Comparison of AMD graphics processing units.) In addition to marketing their own graphics cards, AMD and Nvidia sell their GPUs to authorized AIB suppliers, which AMD and Nvidia refer to as &quot;partners&quot;. The fact that Nvidia and AMD compete directly with their customer/partners complicates relationships in the industry. AMD and Intel being direct competitors in the CPU industry is also noteworthy, since AMD-based graphics cards may be used in computers with Intel CPUs. Intel&#x27;s integrated graphics may weaken AMD, in which the latter derives a significant portion of its revenue from its APUs. As of the second quarter of 2013, there were 52 AIB suppliers. These AIB suppliers may market graphics cards under their own brands, produce graphics cards for private label brands, or produce graphics cards for computer manufacturers. Some AIB suppliers such as MSI build both AMD-based and Nvidia-based graphics cards. Others, such as EVGA, build only Nvidia-based graphics cards, while XFX, now builds only AMD-based graphics cards. Several AIB suppliers are also motherboard suppliers. Most of the largest AIB suppliers are based in Taiwan and they include ASUS, MSI, GIGABYTE, and Palit. Hong Kongbased AIB manufacturers include Sapphire and Zotac. Sapphire and Zotac also sell graphics cards exclusively for AMD and Nvidia GPUs respectively.

== Market ==
Graphics card shipments peaked at a total of 114 million in 1999. By contrast, they totaled 14.5 million units in the third quarter of 2013, a 17% fall from Q3 2012 levels. Shipments reached an annual total of 44 million in 2015. The sales of graphics cards have trended downward due to improvements in integrated graphics technologies; high-end, CPU-integrated graphics can provide competitive performance with low-end graphics cards. At the same time, graphics card sales have grown within the high-end segment, as manufacturers have shifted their focus to prioritize the gaming and enthusiast market.

Beyond the gaming and multimedia segments, graphics cards have been increasingly used for general-purpose computing, such as big data processing. The growth of cryptocurrency has placed a severely high demand on high-end graphics cards, especially in large quantities, due to their advantages in the process of cryptocurrency mining. In January 2018, mid- to high-end graphics cards experienced a major surge in price, with many retailers having stock shortages due to the significant demand among this market. Graphics card companies released mining-specific cards designed to run 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and without video output ports. The graphics card industry took a setback due to the 202021 chip shortage.

== Parts ==

A modern graphics card consists of a printed circuit board on which the components are mounted. These include:

=== Graphics processing unit ===
A graphics processing unit (GPU), also occasionally called visual processing unit (VPU), is a specialized electronic circuit designed to rapidly manipulate and alter memory to accelerate the building of images in a frame buffer intended for output to a display. Because of the large degree of programmable computational complexity for such a task, a modern graphics card is also a computer unto itself.
=== Heat sink ===
A heat sink is mounted on most modern graphics cards. A heat sink spreads out the heat produced by the graphics processing unit evenly throughout the heat sink and unit itself. The heat sink commonly has a fan mounted to cool the heat sink and the graphics processing unit. Not all cards have heat sinks, for example, some cards are liquid-cooled and instead have a water block; additionally, cards from the 1980s and early 1990s did not produce much heat, and did not require heat sinks. Most modern graphics cards need proper thermal solutions. They can be water-cooled or through heat sinks with additional connected heat pipes usually made of copper for the best thermal transfer.

=== Video BIOS ===
The video BIOS or firmware contains a minimal program for the initial set up and control of the graphics card. It may contain information on the memory and memory timing, operating speeds and voltages of the graphics processor, and other details which can sometimes be changed.

Modern Video BIOSes do not support full functionalities of graphics cards; they are only sufficient to identify and initialize the card to display one of a few frame buffer or text display modes. It does not support YUV to RGB translation, video scaling, pixel copying, compositing or any of the multitude of other 2D and 3D features of the graphics card, which must be accessed by software drivers.

=== Video memory ===
The memory capacity of most modern graphics cards ranges from 2 to 24 GB. But with up to 32 GB as of the last 2010s, the applications for graphics use are becoming more powerful and widespread. Since video memory needs to be accessed by the GPU and the display circuitry, it often uses special high-speed or multi-port memory, such as VRAM, WRAM, SGRAM, etc. Around 2003, the video memory was typically based on DDR technology. During and after that year, manufacturers moved towards DDR2, GDDR3, GDDR4, GDDR5, GDDR5X, and GDDR6. The effective memory clock rate in modern cards is generally between 2 and 15 GHz.

Video memory may be used for storing other data as well as the screen image, such as the Z-buffer, which manages the depth coordinates in 3D graphics, as well as textures, vertex buffers, and compiled shader programs.

=== RAMDAC ===
The RAMDAC, or random-access-memory digital-to-analog converter, converts digital signals to analog signals for use by a computer display that uses analog inputs such as cathode-ray tube (CRT) displays. The RAMDAC is a kind of RAM chip that regulates the functioning of the graphics card. Depending on the number of bits used and the RAMDAC-data-transfer rate, the converter will be able to support different computer-display refresh rates. With CRT displays, it is best to work over 75 Hz and never under 60 Hz, to minimize flicker. (This is not a problem with LCD displays, as they have little to no flicker.) Due to the growing popularity of digital computer displays and the integration of the RAMDAC onto the GPU die, it has mostly disappeared as a discrete component. All current LCD/plasma monitors and TVs and projectors with only digital connections work in the digital domain and do not require a RAMDAC for those connections. There are displays that feature analog inputs (VGA, component, SCART, etc.) &quot;only&quot;. These require a RAMDAC, but they reconvert the analog signal back to digital before they can display it, with the unavoidable loss of quality stemming from this digital-to-analog-to-digital conversion. With the VGA standard being phased out in favor of digital formats, RAMDACs have started to disappear from graphics cards.
=== Output interfaces ===

The most common connection systems between the graphics card and the computer display are:

==== Video Graphics Array (VGA) (DE-15) ====

Also known as D-sub, VGA is an analog-based standard adopted in the late 1980s designed for CRT displays, also called VGA connector. Today, the VGA analog interface is used for high definition video resolutions including 1080p and higher. Some problems of this standard are electrical noise, image distortion and sampling error in evaluating pixels. While the VGA transmission bandwidth is high enough to support even higher resolution playback, the picture quality can degrade depending on cable quality and length. The extent of quality difference depends on the individual&#x27;s eyesight and the display; when using a DVI or HDMI connection, especially on larger sized LCD/LED monitors or TVs, quality degradation, if present, is prominently visible. Blu-ray playback at 1080p is possible via the VGA analog interface, if Image Constraint Token (ICT) is not enabled on the Blu-ray disc.

==== Digital Visual Interface (DVI) ====
Digital Visual Interface is a digital-based standard designed for displays such as flat-panel displays (LCDs, plasma screens, wide high-definition television displays) and video projectors. There were also some rare high-end CRT monitors that use DVI. It avoids image distortion and electrical noise, corresponding each pixel from the computer to a display pixel, using its native resolution. It is worth noting that most manufacturers include a DVI-I connector, allowing (via simple adapter) standard RGB signal output to an old CRT or LCD monitor with VGA input.

==== Video-in video-out (VIVO) for S-Video, composite video and component video ====
These connectors are included to allow connection with televisions, DVD players, video recorders and video game consoles. They often come in two 10-pin mini-DIN connector variations, and the VIVO splitter cable generally comes with either 4 connectors (S-Video in and out plus composite video in and out), or 6 connectors (S-Video in and out, component YPBPR out and composite in and out).

==== High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) ====
HDMI is a compact audio/video interface for transferring uncompressed video data and compressed/uncompressed digital audio data from an HDMI-compliant device (&quot;the source device&quot;) to a compatible digital audio device, computer monitor, video projector, or digital television. HDMI is a digital replacement for existing analog video standards. HDMI supports copy protection through HDCP.

==== DisplayPort ====

DisplayPort is a digital display interface developed by the Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA). The interface is primarily used to connect a video source to a display device such as a computer monitor, though it can also be used to transmit audio, USB, and other forms of data.
The VESA specification is royalty-free. VESA designed it to replace VGA, DVI, and LVDS. Backward compatibility to VGA and DVI by using adapter dongles enables consumers to use DisplayPort fitted video sources without replacing existing display devices. Although DisplayPort has a greater throughput of the same functionality as HDMI, it is expected to complement the interface, not replace it.

==== USB-C ====
==== Other types of connection systems ====
=== Motherboard interfaces ===

Chronologically, connection systems between graphics card and motherboard were, mainly:

* S-100 bus: Designed in 1974 as a part of the Altair 8800, it is the first industry-standard bus for the microcomputer industry.
* ISA: Introduced in 1981 by IBM, it became dominant in the marketplace in the 1980s. It is an 8- or 16-bit bus clocked at 8 MHz.
* NuBus: Used in Macintosh II, it is a 32-bit bus with an average bandwidth of 10 to 20 MB/s.
* MCA: Introduced in 1987 by IBM it is a 32-bit bus clocked at 10 MHz.
* EISA: Released in 1988 to compete with IBM&#x27;s MCA, it was compatible with the earlier ISA bus. It is a 32-bit bus clocked at 8.33 MHz.
* VLB: An extension of ISA, it is a 32-bit bus clocked at 33 MHz. Also referred to as VESA.
* PCI: Replaced the EISA, ISA, MCA and VESA buses from 1993 onwards. PCI allowed dynamic connectivity between devices, avoiding the manual adjustments required with jumpers. It is a 32-bit bus clocked 33 MHz.
* UPA: An interconnect bus architecture introduced by Sun Microsystems in 1995. It is a 64-bit bus clocked at 67 or 83 MHz.
* USB: Although mostly used for miscellaneous devices, such as secondary storage devices or peripherals and toys, USB displays and display adapters exist. It was first used in 1996.
* AGP: First used in 1997, it is a dedicated-to-graphics bus. It is a 32-bit bus clocked at 66 MHz.
* PCI-X: An extension of the PCI bus, it was introduced in 1998. It improves upon PCI by extending the width of bus to 64 bits and the clock frequency to up to 133 MHz.
* PCI Express: Abbreviated as PCIe, it is a point-to-point interface released in 2004. In 2006, it provided a data-transfer rate that is double of AGP. It should not be confused with PCI-X, an enhanced version of the original PCI specification. This is standard for most modern graphics cards.

<text>In telecommunications, node-to-node data transfer is the movement of data from one node of a network to the next. In the OSI model it is handled by the lowest two layers, the data link layer and the physical layer.

In most communication systems, the transmitting point applies source coding, followed by channel coding, and lastly, line coding. This produces the baseband signal. The presence of filters may perform pulse shaping. Some systems then use modulation to multiplex many baseband signals into a broadband signal. The receiver un-does these transformations in reverse order: demodulation, trellis decoding, error detection and correction, decompression.

Some communication systems omit one or more of these steps, or use techniques that combine several of these steps together. For example, a Morse code transmitter combines source coding, channel coding, and line coding into one step, typically followed by an amplitude modulation step. Barcodes, on the other hand, add a checksum digit during channel coding, then translate each digit into a barcode symbol during line coding, omitting modulation.

==Source coding==
:&quot;See main article Data compression&quot;

Source coding is the elimination of redundancy to make efficient use of storage space and/or transmission channels.

Examples of source coding are: 
*Huffman coding
*Morse code
*Binary coding

==Channel coding==
:&quot;See main article Error correction and detection.&quot;

In digital telecommunications, channel coding is a pre-transmission mapping applied to a digital signal or data file, usually designed to make error-correction (or at least error detection) possible.

Error correction is implemented by using more digits (bits in cases of binary channel) than the number strictly necessary for the samples and having the receiver compute the most likely valid message that could have resulted in the received one.

Types of channel coding include:
*Parity checks
*Hamming code
*Reed-Muller code 
*Reed-Solomon code 
*Turbo coding

==Line coding==
:&quot;See main article Line code&quot;

Line coding consists of representing the digital signal to be transported, by an amplitude- and time-discrete signal, that is optimally tuned for the specific properties of the physical channel (and of the receiving equipment). The waveform pattern of voltage or current used to represent the 1s and 0s of a digital signal on a transmission link is called line encoding. 
After line coding, the signal can directly be put on a transmission line, in the form of variations of the current. The common types of line encoding are unipolar, polar, bipolar and Manchester encoding.

Line coding should make it possible for the receiver to synchronise itself to the phase of the received signal. It is also preferred for the line code to have a structure that will enable error detection.

Examples of line coding include:
&quot;(see main article line code)&quot;
*B8ZS
*HDB3
*2B1Q
*AMI
*Gray coding

==Modulation==
Modulation is the process of varying a &quot;carrier signal&quot;, typically a sine wave to use that signal to convey information. One of the three key characteristics of a signal are usually modulated: its phase, frequency or amplitude.

In digital modulation, the changes in the signal are chosen from a fixed list (the modulation alphabet) each entry of which conveys a different possible piece of information (a symbol). In analogue modulation, the change is applied continuously in response to the data signal.

Modulation is generally performed to overcome signal transmission issues such as to allow
* Easy (low loss, low dispersion) propagation as electromagnetic waves
* Multiplexing, the transmission of multiple data signals in one frequency band, on different carrier frequencies.
* Smaller, more directional antennas

Carrier signals are usually high frequency electromagnetic waves.

Examples of modulation include:
*amplitude modulation
*frequency modulation
*Phase-shift keying

<doc id="113635" wikidata="Q317869" url="?curid=113635" title="Wong Fei-hung">
<text>Wong Fei-hung (born Wong Sek-cheung with the courtesy name Tat-wun; 19 August 1847 – 17 April 1925) was a Chinese martial artist, physician, and folk hero. His recent fame was due to becoming the protagonist of numerous martial arts films and television series. The role of Wong Fei-hung has been played by numerous well-known stars of Hong Kong and Chinese cinema, including Gordon Liu, Jackie Chan, Kwan Tak-hing, Jet Li, Vincent Zhao, and Sammo Hung. Even though he was considered an expert in the Hung Ga style of Chinese martial arts, his real public fame was as a physician who practiced and taught acupuncture, Dit Da (Chinese chiropractics) and other forms of traditional Chinese medicine in the now defunct Po Chi Lam (), a medical clinic in Canton (Guangzhou), Guangdong Province. Two museums dedicated to him was built in his birthplace in Foshan, Guangdong.

==Alternative names==
Wong&#x27;s original given name was Sek-cheung or Xixiang () before it was changed to Fei-hung (Feihong). His courtesy name was Dat-wan or Dayun ().

==Life==
Wong was born in Luzhou Hamlet, Lingxi Village, Xiqiao Country, Foshan, Nanhai County, which is a present day part of Foshan City, Guangdong Province, during the reign of the Daoguang Emperor in the Qing dynasty. His ancestral home was in Luzhou Hamlet, Lingxi Village, Xiqiao Country, Foshan, Nanhai County, Canton Prefecture, Guangdong Province, which is now part of Xiqiao Town, Nanhai District, Foshan City.

At the age of five, Wong started learning Hung Ga from his father, Wong Kei-ying. He often accompanied his father on trips from Foshan to Guangzhou, the provincial capital of Guangdong Province, where his father peddled medicine and performed martial arts in the streets. When he was 13, he encountered Lam Fuk-sing (林福成; Lin Fucheng), an apprentice of &quot;Iron Bridge Three&quot; Leung Kwan, in Douchi Street in Foshan Town. Lam taught him how to use the sling and the essential moves of the martial art Iron Wire Fist. Later, he learned the shadowless kick from Sung Fai-tong (宋輝鏜; Song Huitang).. Wong Fei-hung was very personable like his father, and made many friends in the martial arts and medical worlds, like the 10 Tigers of Guangdong. With these friendships and chance meetings, he was exposed to vast amounts of knowledge that were openly shared with him. He was able to enhance his father&#x27;s teachings to formulate a style that included much of what is seen in Southern Chinese Styles today.

In 1863, Wong started a martial arts school in Shuijiao () in Saikwan (Xiguan), which is the present-day location of Liwan District, Guangzhou City. His students were mainly metal labourers and street vendors. In 1886, Wong opened his family&#x27;s medical clinic, Po Chi Lam (寶芝林; Baozhilin), in Ren&#x27;an (), which is the present-day part of Xiaobei Road, Yuexiu District, Guangzhou City. In legend, around the 1860s or 1870s, Wong was recruited by Liu Yongfu, the commander of the Black Flag Army, to be the medical officer and martial arts instructor for the regular soldiers and the local militia in Guangzhou. He also followed the Black Flag Army to fight the Imperial Japanese Army during the Japanese invasion of Taiwan in 1895.

In 1912, the Republic of China was established following the collapse of the Qing dynasty. During the chaotic early years of the Republican era, many businessmen who operated places of entertainment in Guangzhou decided to hire guards (or bouncers) to protect their businesses on-site in case trouble broke out. As Wong was trained in martial arts, he was hired by various businesses to be one of such guards.

In 1919, when the Chin Woo Athletic Association opened a branch in Canton, Wong was invited to perform at the opening ceremony. In the same year, Wong Hon-sam, one of Wong&#x27;s sons, who was working as a bodyguard in Wuzhou, Guangxi, was murdered by a rival known as &quot;Devil Eye&quot; Leung (), who was apparently jealous that Wong Hon-sam was better than him in martial arts. Wong was so affected by this incident that he stopped teaching his other sons martial arts.

Between August and October 1924, Wong&#x27;s medical clinic, Po Chi Lam, was destroyed when the Nationalist government was suppressing the uprising by the Guangzhou Merchant Volunteers Corps. Wong felt so dejected and saddened by the loss of Po Chi Lam that he fell into depression and became ill. He died from illness on 17 April 1925 in Chengxi Fangbian Hospital (), which is the present day location of the Guangzhou First People&#x27;s Hospital () at Panfu Road in Guangzhou&#x27;s Yuexiu District. He was buried at the foot of Baiyun Mountain.

Wong&#x27;s fourth wife, Mok Kwai-lan, and his sons, along with his students Lam Sai-wing and Dang Sai-king (鄧世瓊; Deng Shiqiong), moved to Hong Kong and opened martial arts schools there.

Wong&#x27;s grave location is currently unknown. It is believed that his grave, along with others within the cemetery were long expunged for future developments.

==Fighting style==
Wong was a master of Hung Ga. He systematised the predominant style of Hung Ga and choreographed its version of the Tiger Crane Paired Form Fist, which incorporates his Ten Special Fist techniques. Wong is famous for using the Shadowless Kick. He named the techniques of his skills when he performed them.

Wong was adept at using weapons, such as the staff and southern tiger fork. One tale, possibly fictional, recounts how Wong defeated a group of 30 gangsters on the docks of Guangzhou with a staff.

Among Wong&#x27;s students, the more notable ones include Lam Sai-wing (林世榮; Lin Shirong), Leung Foon (梁寬; Liang Kuan), Dang Fong (Deng Fang), and Ling Wan-kai (凌雲階; Ling Yunjie).

Wong is sometimes incorrectly identified as one of the &quot;Ten Tigers of Canton&quot;. His father, Wong Kei-ying, was one of the ten but Wong himself was not. Wong is also sometimes referred to as the &quot;Tiger after the Ten Tigers&quot;.

According to a folklore, So Chan also taught Wong Fei-hung in drunken boxing.

==Family==
After his first wife died of illness in 1871, Wong was widowed for 25 years. In 1896, he married his second wife and had two sons and two daughters with her. Some time after she died of illness, Wong remarried again in 1902. His third wife bore him two sons before falling victim to a deadly illness. His fourth and final wife stayed with him from 1915 up till his death. The personal names of his first three wives are unknown. He had four known children.

;Spouses
* Wong&#x27;s first wife was surnamed &quot;Lo&quot; or &quot;Law&quot; (). She married Wong in 1871 and died of illness three months after their marriage.
* Wong&#x27;s second wife was surnamed &quot;Ma&quot; (). She married Wong in 1896 and died of illness. She bore Wong two sons and two daughters.
* Wong&#x27;s third wife was surnamed &quot;Sam&quot; or &quot;Sum&quot; (). She married Wong in 1902 and died of illness. She bore Wong two sons.
* Wong&#x27;s fourth wife, Mok Kwai-lan (), married Wong in 1915. She outlived him and died in Hong Kong on 11 March 1982. As Wong believed that his first three wives died because of a curse on him, he never took another formal spouse; Mok was actually his concubine in name.

;Sons
* Wong Hon-syu (), born to Wong&#x27;s third wife.
* Wong Hon-hei (), also born to Wong&#x27;s third wife.
* Wong Hon-lam (), born to Wong&#x27;s second wife.
* Wong Hon-sam (), also born to Wong&#x27;s second wife.

;Daughters
At present, there is no information on Wong&#x27;s two daughters.

;Descendants
Wong had at least three grandsons and six granddaughters. His descendants currently live in Australia, Latin America and Southeast Asia.

==Legacy==
In 1996, the Wong Fei-hung Lion Dance Martial Arts Museum was built in his hometown in Foshan.

A Wong Fei-hung Memorial Hall was built in 2000 and was officially opened in January 2001 in his honour in Foshan, Chancheng District. The exhibits cover his entire life, including his martial arts and medical careers. The hall contains a reconstruction of Po Chi Lam.

==Alleged photos==
The first alleged photo was said to have been provided by his fourth spouse Mok Kwai-lan to Leung Ting of the &quot;Real Kung Fu&quot; () magazine in 1976. Decades later, it was first exhibited at the Wong Fei-hung Memorial Hall in 2000 and was controversially seen and even promoted by martial artists as a photo of Wong Fei-hung. This was dismissed in 2009 by &quot;New Martial Hero&quot;&#x27;s article that the man in the photo was of that of his fourth son, Wong Hon-hei.

In 2005, another alleged photo of Wong Fei-hung once taken by one of his students Kwong Kei-tim () was discovered by the museum staff in Hong Kong. The man in the photo bears a close resemblance to his son, whose photo was the first to be often mistaken for his own father&#x27;s back then. His fourth spouse Mok Kwai-lan once stated that her husband was quite superstitious and believed that having photos taken of oneself would shorten one&#x27;s lifespan, so Wong only had one picture of himself taken in his lifetime, namely the one taken by his student Kwong.

<text>Guadalcanal (; indigenous name: &quot;Isatabu&quot;) is the principal island in Guadalcanal Province of Solomon Islands, located in the southwestern Pacific Ocean, northeast of Australia. It is the largest island in the Solomons by area and the second-largest by population (after Malaita). The island is mainly covered in dense tropical rainforest and has a mountainous hinterland.


Guadalcanal was first charted by Europeans during the Spanish expedition of Álvaro de Mendaña in 1568. The name comes from the village of Guadalcanal, in the province of Seville, in Andalusia, Spain, birthplace of Pedro de Ortega Valencia, a member of Mendaña&#x27;s expedition.

During 1942 and 1943, it was the scene of the Guadalcanal campaign and saw bitter fighting between Japanese and U.S. troops. The Americans were ultimately victorious. At the end of World War II, Honiara, on the north coast of Guadalcanal, became the new capital of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate and later the capital of the independent nation of Solomon Islands.

==Geography==

Guadalcanal is the largest island in Solomon Islands, with a total land area of , and has a population of 155,605 people, making it the second-most populous island in the country after Malaita. Mount Popomanaseu is the island&#x27;s highest point and the highest in Solomon Islands, with an elevation of above sea level. The Mbokokimbo River is the island&#x27;s longest river, with a total length of .

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The island has been settled since at least 4500–2500 BC based on archaeological finds at Poha Cave and Vatuluma Posovi. During the period 1200-800 BC, Austronesian Lapita peoples settled the islands.

A Spanish expedition from Peru in 1568 under the command of Álvaro de Mendaña de Neira were the first Europeans to see the island. Mendaña&#x27;s subordinate, Pedro de Ortega Valencia, named the island after his home town Guadalcanal in Andalusia, Spain. In the years that followed the discovery, the island was variously referred to as Guadarcana, Guarcana, Guadalcana, and Guadalcanar, which reflected different pronunciations of its name in Andalusian Spanish.

European settlers, whalers, and missionaries began to arrive in the 18th and 19th centuries. With these outsiders also arrived foreign institutions such as forced labour. Beginning during the 1860s, about 60,000 natives from many parts of the Solomon Islands were indentured and sent to Australia or Fiji by British authorities to work on plantations. This system continued into the 1890s. In the 1880s, the Germans and the British vied for control of the Solomons. Germany established a protectorate over the northern Solomons in 1884, while in 1893, the British Solomon Islands Protectorate was proclaimed, which included the island of Guadalcanal. Germany eventually handed over most of their protectorate to Britain, though, in 1899. By the early 20th century, large agricultural plantations (specialising in copra), run mainly by Australians, were established in the region. Guadalcanal was not seriously affected by World War I. In 1932, the British confirmed the name Guadalcanal in line with the town in Andalusia, Spain.

=== Second World War ===

In the months following the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Japanese drove the Americans out of the Philippines, the British out of British Malaya, and the Dutch out of the East Indies. The Japanese then began to expand into the western Pacific, occupying many islands in an attempt to build a defensive ring around their conquests and threaten the lines of communication from the United States to Australia and New Zealand. The Japanese reached Guadalcanal in May 1942.

When an American reconnaissance mission spotted construction of a Japanese airfield at Lunga Point on the north coast of Guadalcanal, the situation became critical. This new Japanese airfield represented a threat to Australia, so as a matter of urgency, despite not being adequately prepared, the United States conducted its first amphibious landing of the war on Guadalcanal. The initial landings of the 1st Marine Division on 7 August 1942 secured the airfield with little difficulty, but holding the airfield for the next six months against combined Japanese ground assault, air attack and naval bombardment was one of the most hotly contested campaigns in the entire Pacific theater of war.

Immediately after landing on the island, U.S. Navy Seabees began finishing the airfield begun by the Japanese. It was then named Henderson Field after a Marine aviator killed in combat during the Battle of Midway. Aircraft operating from Henderson Field during the campaign were a mix of U.S. Marine, Army, Navy, and other Allied aircraft that became known as the Cactus Air Force. They defended the airfield and threatened any Japanese ships that ventured too close to the island during daylight hours. At night, however, Japanese naval forces were frequently able to shell the airfield and deliver troops with supplies, retiring before daylight. The Japanese used fast ships, namely destroyers, to conduct this reinforcement and supply effort, which became known as the Tokyo Express. So many ships from both sides were sunk in the many naval engagements in and around the Solomon Island chain that the nearby waters came to be referred to as Ironbottom Sound.

The naval Battle of Cape Esperance was fought on 11 October 1942 in the waters off the northwest coast of Guadalcanal. During the engagement, the United States Navy intercepted and defeated a Japanese formation of ships on their way down &quot;the Slot&quot; to reinforce and resupply troops on the island, suffering losses of their own in the process. The multi-day Naval Battle of Guadalcanal in early November marked a critical turning point in the campaign. Allied naval forces engaged a large, experienced Japanese surface force at night and forced it to withdraw, sinking the IJN battleship &quot;Kirishima&quot; in the process. This was one of only two times in the Pacific theater of war that two battleships engaged each other in combat, with the next such engagement occurring in 1944 during the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Some Japanese viewpoints consider these naval engagements, which showcased the improving capability of Allied warships to challenge the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s significant advantage in night-fighting techniques, to be just as significant as the Battle of Midway in turning the tide against them.

After six months of hard combat in and around Guadalcanal, the Japanese forces on the island were critically undersupplied and no longer combat effective, while Allied troops were steadily increasing in quantity and quality. Remaining Japanese forces on the island were evacuated at Cape Esperance on the northwest coast in February 1943. American authorities declared Guadalcanal secure on 9 February 1943. The Guadalcanal campaign was a major turning point in the war, as it stopped further Japanese expansion. 

Two U.S. Navy ships have been named for the campaign:
*USS &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; (CVE-60) was a World War II escort carrier.
*USS &quot;Guadalcanal&quot; (LPH-7) was an amphibious assault ship.

To date, the only U.S. Coast Guardsman recipient of the Medal of Honor is Signalman 1st Class Douglas Albert Munro, awarded posthumously for his extraordinary heroism on 27 September 1942 at Point Cruz. Munro provided covering fire and helped evacuate 500 besieged Marines from a beach at Point Cruz; he was killed during the evacuation. During the Battle for Henderson Field, the Medal of Honor was also awarded to John Basilone, who was later killed in action during the Battle of Iwo Jima in 1945.

After the war, American and Japanese groups repeatedly visited Guadalcanal to search for the remains of missing soldiers. The bodies of some 7,000 Japanese troops remain missing on the island, and islanders still bring the Japanese groups bones that they say are those of unearthed Japanese soldiers.

===Postwar years===
Immediately after the Second World War, the capital of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate was moved to Honiara on Guadalcanal from its previous location at Tulagi in the Florida Islands. In 1952, the high commissioner for the Western Pacific moved from Fiji to Honiara, and the post was combined with that of the governor of the Solomon Islands. The airfield which was the cause of the fighting in 1942, and which became well known as Henderson Field, is now the international airport for the Solomon Islands. It sits about five miles to the east of Honiara. The secondary airfield, known as &quot;Fighter Two&quot;, is now the local golf course.

=== Civil war ===
In early 1999, long-simmering tensions between the local Guale people on Guadalcanal and more recent migrants from the neighbouring island of Malaita erupted into violence. The Guadalcanal Revolutionary Army, later called Isatabu Freedom Movement, began terrorising Malaitans in the rural areas of the island in an effort to force them out of their homes. About 20,000 Malaitans fled to the capital, and others returned to their home island; Guale residents of Honiara fled. The city became a Malaitan enclave and the Malaita Eagle Force took over government. The Royal Australian Navy and Royal New Zealand Navy deployed vessels to the area to protect the expatriate community resident mostly in Honiara. In 2003, the Pacific Forum negotiated the intervention of RAMSI or Operation Helpem Fren involving Australia, New Zealand, and other Pacific island nations.

==Vilu War Museum==

About 25 km (15 mi) from Honiara to the west, Vilu War Museum houses an outdoor collection of remains of various parts of military equipment and of several aircraft. Several memorials for the American, Australian, Fijian, New Zealand, and Japanese soldiers who died were erected, as well.

==Fauna==
The island hosts a native marsupial known as the phalanger or grey cuscus, &quot;Phalanger orientalis&quot;. The only other mammals are bats and rodents.

Many species of colourful parrots are found there, and estuarine crocodiles inhabit the island&#x27;s shores. In recent times, these crocodiles have been found only on the Weather Coast in the south of the island, but during World War II, they were found along the north coast in the vicinity of the airstrip where the fighting was taking place, as evidenced by names such as Alligator Creek.

Venomous snakes are rare on the island and are not considered to be a serious threat, but a kind of centipede there has a particularly nasty bite.
The Guadalcanal Watersheds form a site that has been identified by BirdLife International as an important bird area, because it supports populations of threatened or endemic bird species. At 376,146 ha (1,452 sq mi), it covers some 70% of the island, extending along the southern coast inland to the central highlands, and contains riverine and lowland tropical rainforest, as well as the greatest contiguous area of cloud forest in the Solomons. Although it also contains gardens and old village sites, most of it has never been permanently inhabited. Significant birds for which the site was identified include chestnut-bellied imperial pigeons, Woodford&#x27;s rails, Guadalcanal moustached kingfishers, Meek&#x27;s lorikeets, Guadalcanal honeyeaters, Guadalcanal thicketbirds, and Guadalcanal thrushes. Potential threats to the site include logging and invasive species.

<text>In bridge, a non-simultaneous double squeeze is a double squeeze in which the pressure is not applied to both opponents at the same trick. Before categorizing a little more about it we will show a diagram for the four basic matrices.
1) When the club ace is played West is squeezed immediately and has to shed a spade. North plays the now useless jack of hearts and East still has an idle card to throw, the three of hearts. But when the heart deuce is led up to the ace, East is squeezed on his turn in the pointed suits. This is a positional squeeze.

2) When the club ace is played West can shed a heart, but East is squeezed and has to give up his spade guard. When the heart deuce is led to the ace it is West who is squeezed in the pointed suits. This is an automatic squeeze.
3) When the club ace is played West is squeezed immediately and has to shed a spade. North plays the now useless jack of hearts and East still has an idle card to throw, the three of hearts. A spade is led to the king and the heart ace is cashed. On that card East is squeezed in the pointed suits.
This is a positional squeeze.
4)When the club ace is played West is squeezed immediately and has to shed a spade. &quot;Two&quot; hearts are cashed and East is squeezed between the pointed suits on the second of them.
This is an automatic squeeze.
In all double squeezes the second squeeze card is opposed to (that is in the other hand than) the first squeeze card (it could be in the same hand in diagram (2) though). The double menace is always in the same hand than the first squeeze card.
In matrices (1) and (2) the second squeeze executes immediately after the first. For that reason the squeeze card is an entry to North.
In matrices (3) and (4) we cross to the North hand and then execute the squeeze, two tricks later than the first one. But that could even be later as demonstrated by the following diagram, which is a somehow extreme variation of (4).
We have an eight card ending and by playing the club ace West is squeezed, forced to give up a spade. East will be squeezed five tricks later on the heart ten.

<text>The Petronas Towers (), also known as the Petronas Twin Towers and colloquially the KLCC Twin Towers, are an interlinked pair of 88-storey supertall skyscrapers in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, standing at . From 1996 to 2004, they were the tallest buildings in the world until they were surpassed by the Taipei 101 building. The Petronas Towers remain the world&#x27;s tallest twin skyscrapers, surpassing the original World Trade Center towers in New York City, and were the tallest buildings in Malaysia until 2021, when they were surpassed by Merdeka 118. The Petronas Towers are a major landmark of Kuala Lumpur, along with the nearby Kuala Lumpur Tower and Merdeka 118, and are visible in many places across the city.

==History and architecture==
The Petronas Towers&#x27; structural system is a tube in tube design, invented by Bangladeshi-American architect Fazlur Rahman Khan. Applying a tube-structure for extreme tall buildings is a common phenomenon.
The 88-floor towers are constructed largely of reinforced concrete, with a steel and glass facade designed to resemble motifs found in Islamic art, a reflection of Malaysia&#x27;s Muslim religion. Another Islamic influence on the design is that the cross section of the towers is based on a Rub el Hizb, albeit with circular sectors added to meet office space requirements. The circular sectors are similar to the bottom part of the Qutb Minar.

The towers were designed by Argentine-American architect César Pelli. A distinctive postmodern style was chosen to create a 21st-century icon for Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Planning on the Petronas Towers started on 1 January 1992 and included rigorous tests and simulations of wind and structural loads on the design. Seven years of construction followed at the former site of the original Selangor Turf Club, beginning on 1 March 1993 with excavation, which involved moving 500 truckloads of earth every night to dig down below the surface.
The construction of the superstructure commenced on 1 April 1994. Interiors with furniture were completed on 1 January 1996, the spires of Tower 1 and Tower 2 were completed on 1 March 1996, 3 years after its construction was started, and the first batch of Petronas personnel moved into the building on 1 January 1997. The building was officially opened by the Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Dr. Mahathir bin Mohamad, on 31 August 1999. The twin towers were built on the site of Kuala Lumpur&#x27;s race track. It was the tallest structure in Malaysia at the time of its completion. Test boreholes found that the original construction site effectively sat on the edge of a cliff. One half of the site was decayed limestone while the other half was soft rock. The entire site was moved to allow the buildings to sit entirely on the soft rock. Because of the depth of the bedrock, the buildings were built on the world&#x27;s deepest foundations. 104 concrete piles, ranging from deep, were bored into the ground. The concrete raft foundation, comprising of concrete was continuously poured through a period of 54 hours for each tower. The raft is thick, weighs and held the world record for the largest concrete pour until 2007. The foundations were completed within 12 months by Bachy Soletanche and required massive amounts of concrete.
As a result of the Malaysian government specifying that the buildings be completed in six years, two construction consortia were hired to meet the deadline, one for each tower. Tower 1, the west tower (left in the top-right photograph) was built by a Japanese consortium led by the Hazama Corporation (JA Jones Construction Co., MMC Engineering Services Sdn Bhd, Ho Hup Construction Co. Bhd and Mitsubishi Corp) while Tower 2, the east tower (right in the top-right photograph) was built by a South Korean consortium led by the Samsung C&amp;T Corporation (Kukdong Engineering &amp; Construction and Syarikat Jasatera Sdn Bhd).

Early into construction a batch of concrete failed a routine strength test causing construction to come to a complete halt. All the completed floors were tested but it was found that only one had used a bad batch and it was demolished. As a result of the concrete failure, each new batch was tested before being poured. The halt in construction had cost US$700,000 per day and led to three separate concrete plants being set up on the site to ensure that if one produced a bad batch, the other two could continue to supply concrete. The sky bridge contract was completed by Kukdong Engineering &amp; Construction. Tower 2 (Samsung C&amp;T) became the first to reach the world&#x27;s tallest building at the time.

Due to the huge cost of importing steel, the towers were constructed on a cheaper radical design of super high-strength reinforced concrete. High-strength concrete is a material familiar to Asian contractors and twice as effective as steel in sway reduction; however, it makes the building twice as heavy on its foundation as a comparable steel building. Supported by 23-by-23 metre concrete cores and an outer ring of widely spaced super columns, the towers use a sophisticated structural system that accommodates its slender profile and provides 560,000 square metres of column-free office space. Below the twin towers is Suria KLCC, a shopping mall, and Petronas Philharmonic Hall, the home of the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra.

===Notable events===

* On 15 April 1999, Felix Baumgartner set the world record for BASE jumping (since broken) by jumping off a window cleaning crane on the Petronas Towers.
* Thousands of people were evacuated on 12 September 2001 after a bomb threat the day after the September 11 attacks destroyed the World Trade Center towers in New York City. Bomb disposal squads found no explosives in the towers, but they nevertheless evacuated the premises. Workers and shoppers were allowed to return three hours later, around noon. No one was hurt during the evacuation.
* On the evening of 4 November 2005, a fire broke out in the cinema complex of the Suria KLCC shopping centre below the Petronas Towers, triggering panic among patrons. There were no reports of injuries. The buildings were largely empty, except the shopping mall, Suria KLCC, because of the late hour; the only people involved were moviegoers and some diners in restaurants.
* On the morning of 1 September 2009, French urban climber Alain &quot;Spiderman&quot; Robert, using only his bare hands and feet and with no safety devices, scaled to the top of Tower Two in just under 2 hours after two previous efforts had ended in arrest. In his first attempt on 20 March 1997, police arrested him at the 60th floor, 28 floors away from the &quot;summit&quot;. His second attempt, on 20 March 2007, exactly 10 years later, was also stopped on the same floor, though on the other tower.

==Anchor tenants==
Tower One is fully occupied by Petronas and a number of its subsidiaries and associate companies, while the office spaces in Tower Two are mostly available for lease to other companies. A number of companies have offices in Tower Two, including SapuraOMV Upstream (Sarawak) Inc., Huawei Technologies, AVEVA, Al Jazeera English, Carigali Hess, Bloomberg, Boeing, IBM, Khazanah Nasional Berhad, McKinsey &amp; Co, WIPRO Limited, TCS, HCLTech, Krawler, Microsoft, The Agency (a modelling company) and Reuters.

==Features==

===Suria KLCC===
Suria KLCC is a upscale retail center at the foot of the Petronas Towers. It features mostly foreign luxury goods and high-street labels. Its attractions include an art gallery, an underwater aquarium and also a Science center. Boasting approximately 300 stores, Suria KLCC is touted as one of the largest shopping malls in Malaysia. The Petronas Philharmonic Hall, also built at the base of the towers, is frequently associated with Suria KLCC&#x27;s floorspace. During holidays or celebration days, Suria KLCC is the top spot to see the decorations especially at the main entrances and also in Centre Court. It also promotes the uniqueness and beauty of Malaysia&#x27;s cultural diversity towards the visitors.

===KLCC Park===
Spanning below the building is the KLCC Park with jogging and walking paths, a fountain with incorporated light show, wading pools, and a children&#x27;s playground.

===Skybridge===
The towers feature a double decker skybridge connecting the two towers on the 41st and 42nd floors, holding the record for the highest 2-story bridge in the world. The skybridge also functions as a crucial design feature facilitating movement between the two towers during high winds. The bridge is above the ground and long, weighing 750 tons. The same floor is also known as the podium, since visitors going to higher levels have to change elevators here. Dynamic analyses were performed and iterated to support the final design by studying the structural behavior of the twin towers to time-varying loads such as earthquakes and wind. The skybridge is open to all visitors, but tickets are limited to about 1,000 people per day, with around half available to be purchased online, and the other half obtained on a first-come, first-served basis. Petronas began selling tickets in 2010, eliminating free visits. Visitors can choose to opt for package one which is just a visit to the skybridge or go for package two to go to the skybridge and all the way to level 86. Visitors are only allowed on the 41st floor as the 42nd floor can only be used by the tenants of the building.

The skybridge also acts as a safety device, so that in the event of a fire or other emergency in one tower, tenants can evacuate by crossing the skybridge to the other tower. The total evacuation triggered by a bomb hoax on 12 September 2001 (the day after the September 11 attacks destroyed the twin towers of the World Trade Center in New York City) showed that the bridge would not be useful if both towers need to be emptied simultaneously, as the capacity of the staircases was insufficient for such an event. Plans thus call for the lifts to be used if both towers need to be evacuated, and a successful drill following the revised plan was conducted in 2005.

There is a two hinged arch that supports the skybridge with arch legs, each long, that are bolted to level 29 of each of the towers. After being constructed on the ground, the skybridge was lifted into place on the towers over a period of three days in July 1995. Residing on the 41st and 42nd floors, the skybridge connects a conference room, an executive dining room and a prayer room.

===Lift system===
The main bank of lifts is located in the centre of each tower. All main lifts are double-decker with the lower deck of the lift taking passengers to even-numbered floors and upper deck to odd-numbered floors. To reach an odd-numbered floor from ground level, passengers must take an escalator to the upper deck of the lift.

There are 29 double-deck passenger elevators, but there are different sets that service certain floors of the towers, specifically two sets of six of these double-deck passenger elevators to floors 1–23 and 1–37 respectively. Another set of 5 passenger lifts transport passengers to the 41st and 42nd floors where they can switch lifts to reach the upper zones of the buildings, each double-deck passenger lift with the capacity of 52 passengers or, 26 passengers per deck. There are also 6 heavy-duty elevators for utility.

<doc id="113651" wikidata="Q547189" url="?curid=113651" title="Dead Man">
<text>Dead Man is a 1995 American acid Western film written and directed by Jim Jarmusch. It stars Johnny Depp, Gary Farmer, Billy Bob Thornton, Iggy Pop, Crispin Glover, John Hurt, Michael Wincott, Lance Henriksen, Gabriel Byrne, Mili Avital, and Robert Mitchum in his final film performance. The movie, set in the late 19th century, follows William Blake, a meek accountant on the run after killing a man. He has a chance encounter with enigmatic Native American spirit-guide &quot;Nobody&quot;, who believes Blake is the reincarnation of the visionary English poet William Blake.

Described by Jarmusch as a &quot;Psychedelic Western&quot;, the film is shot entirely in monochrome. Neil Young composed the guitar-dominated soundtrack with portions he improvised while watching the movie footage. Many have considered it a premier postmodern Western. It has been compared to Cormac McCarthy&#x27;s novel &quot;Blood Meridian&quot;.

==Plot==
William Blake, an accountant from Cleveland, Ohio, rides by train to the frontier company town of Machine to take up a promised accounting job in the town&#x27;s metal works. During the trip, the train fireman warns Blake against the enterprise. Arriving in town, Blake notes the hostility of the townsfolk towards him. He then discovers that the position has already been filled, and John Dickinson, the ferocious owner of the company, drives Blake from the workplace at gunpoint.

Jobless and without money or prospects, Blake meets Thel Russell, a former prostitute who sells paper flowers. He lets her take him home. Thel&#x27;s ex-boyfriend Charlie surprises them in bed, shoots at Blake, and accidentally kills Thel when she shields Blake with her body. The bullet passes through Thel and wounds Blake, who kills Charlie with Thel&#x27;s gun before climbing out the window and fleeing the town on Charlie&#x27;s horse. Company owner Dickinson is Charlie&#x27;s father and hires three killers — Cole Wilson, Conway Twill, and Johnny &quot;The Kid&quot; Pickett — to bring Blake back &quot;dead or alive&quot;.

Blake awakens to find a large Native American man trying to dislodge the bullet from his chest. The man, calling himself Nobody, reveals that the bullet is too close to Blake&#x27;s heart to remove, rendering Blake effectively a walking dead man. When he learns Blake&#x27;s full name, Nobody decides Blake is a reincarnation of William Blake, a poet whom he idolizes but of whom Blake is ignorant. He decides to care for Blake and to use Native methods to help ease him into death.

Blake learns of Nobody&#x27;s past, marked by prejudice from Euro-Americans who objected to his Indigenous ancestry, and equally from Native Americans who objected that his mother and father were from two opposing tribes, Piikáni and Apsáalooke, respectively. As a child, English soldiers abducted and brought him to Europe as a model savage. He was briefly educated before returning home, where his stories of the white man and his culture were laughed off by fellow Native Americans. They thus dub him Xebeche: &quot;He who talks loud, saying nothing&quot;. Nobody resolves to escort Blake to the Pacific Ocean to return him to his proper place in the spirit world.

Blake and Nobody travel west, leaving a trail of dead and encountering wanted posters announcing growing bounties for Blake&#x27;s death or capture. Nobody leaves Blake alone in the wild when he decides Blake must undergo a vision quest. On his quest, Blake kills two U.S. Marshals, experiences visions of nature spirits, and grieves over the remains of a dead fawn his pursuers accidentally kill. He paints his face with the fawn&#x27;s blood and rejoins Nobody. Meanwhile, the most ferocious member of the bounty hunter posse, Cole Wilson, has killed his comrades (eating one of them) and continued his hunt alone.

At a trading post, a bigoted missionary identifies Blake and attempts to kill him but instead dies at Blake&#x27;s hands. Shortly after, Blake is shot again, and his condition rapidly deteriorates. Nobody hurries to take him by the river to a Makah village and persuades the tribe to give him a canoe for Blake&#x27;s ship burial. Delirious, Blake trudges through the village, where the people pity him, before he collapses from his injuries.

He awakens in a canoe on a beach wearing a Native American funeral dress. Nobody bids Blake farewell and then pushes the canoe out to sea. As he floats away, Blake sees Cole approaching Nobody. Too weak to cry out, he can only watch as the two shoot and kill each other. Looking up at the sky one last time, Blake dies as his canoe drifts out to sea.

==Cast==
* Johnny Depp as William Blake, a meek accountant from Cleveland, Ohio

==Cultural allusions==
The film contains many references to William Blake poetry. Xebeche, aka Nobody, recites from several Blake poems, including &quot;Auguries of Innocence&quot;, &quot;The Marriage of Heaven and Hell&quot;, and &quot;The Everlasting Gospel&quot;. When bounty hunter Cole warns his companions against drinking from standing water, it references the Proverb of Hell (from the aforementioned &quot;Marriage&quot;), &quot;Expect poison from standing water&quot;. Thel&#x27;s name is also a reference to Blake&#x27;s &quot;The Book of Thel&quot;.

The scenes with Thel culminating in the bedroom murder scene visually enact Blake&#x27;s poem, &quot;The Sick Rose&quot;: &quot;O rose, thou art sick. / The invisible worm, / That flies in the night / In the howling storm: / Has found out thy bed / Of crimson joy: / And his dark secret love / Does thy life destroy.&quot; The film&#x27;s soundtrack album and promotional music video also features Depp reciting passages from Blake&#x27;s poetry to music Neil Young composed for the film.

Although the film is set in the 19th century, Jarmusch included a number of references to 20th century American culture. Benmont Tench, the man at the campsite played by Jared Harris, is named after Benmont Tench, keyboardist for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. Billy Bob Thornton&#x27;s character, Big George Drakoulias, is named for record producer George Drakoulias. The name of Mitchum&#x27;s character is a reference to rock producer Jim Dickinson.

The marshals chasing Blake are named Lee Hazlewood and Marvin Throne-berry, after Lee Hazlewood and Marv Throneberry, and also an allusion to the American actor Lee Marvin. Nobody&#x27;s name (&quot;He Who Talks Loud, Saying Nothing&quot;) is a reference to the James Brown song &quot;Talkin&#x27; Loud and Sayin&#x27; Nothing&quot;. Michael Wincott&#x27;s character is shown in possession of a teddy bear. Also, when asked his name, Xebeche answers, &quot;My name is Nobody.&quot; &quot;My Name Is Nobody&quot; was an Italian Western film from 1973 starring Henry Fonda and Terence Hill, and the clever answer of Ulysses to Polyphemus when asked the same question.

==Portrayal of Native Americans==
According to film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum, &quot;Dead Man&quot; is generally regarded as well-researched in regard to Native American culture. The film is also described as one of few about Native Americans to be directed by a non-native that offers a nuanced understanding of the individual differences between Native American tribes with considerable detail given that is relatively free of common stereotypes. Regarding the character Nobody, Jarmusch stated: &quot;I wanted to make an Indian character who wasn’t either a) the savage that must be eliminated, the force of nature that’s blocking the way for industrial progress, or b) the noble innocent that knows all and is another cliché. I wanted him to be a complicated human being.&quot;

The film intentionally leaves conversations in the Cree and Blackfoot languages untranslated and without subtitles, for the exclusive understanding of members of those nations, including several in-jokes aimed at Native American viewers. Nobody was also played by a First Nations actor, Gary Farmer, who is Cayuga.

==Reception==

The film was entered into the 1995 Cannes Film Festival.

In its theatrical release, &quot;Dead Man&quot; earned $1,037,847 on a budget of $9 million. Then, it was the most expensive of Jarmusch&#x27;s films, due in part to the costs of ensuring accurate period detail.

Critical responses were mixed. Roger Ebert gave the film one and a half stars out of four, praising the cinematography and Farmer&#x27;s performance, but otherwise stating the film was &quot;strange, slow [and] unrewarding&quot;, and adding: &quot;Jim Jarmusch is trying to get at something here, and I don&#x27;t have a clue what it is&quot;. Desson Howe and Rita Kempley, both writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, offered largely negative reviews. Greil Marcus, however, mounted a spirited defense of the film, titling his review &quot;Dead Again: Here are 10 reasons why &#x27;Dead Man&#x27; is the best movie of the end of the 20th century.&quot;

Film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum dubbed the film an acid western, calling it &quot;as exciting and as important as any new American movie I&#x27;ve seen in the 90s&quot; and went on to write a book on the film, &quot;Dead Man&quot; () published by the British Film Institute. The film has a 70% approval rating on website Rotten Tomatoes based on 53 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;While decidedly not for all tastes, &quot;Dead Man&quot; marks an alluring change of pace for writer-director Jim Jarmusch that demonstrates an assured command of challenging material&quot;. Metacritic reports a score of 62 out of 100 from 20 critics, indicating &quot;Generally favorable reviews&quot;.

In July 2010, &quot;The New York Times&quot; chief film critic A. O. Scott capped a laudatory &quot;Critics&#x27; Picks&quot; video review of the film by calling it &quot;One of the very best movies of the 1990s.&quot;

The Criterion Collection added the film to their collection, due to its &quot;profound and unique revision of the western genre&quot;.

==Soundtrack==

Neil Young recorded the soundtrack by improvising (mostly on his electric guitar, with some acoustic guitar, piano and organ) as he watched the newly edited film alone in a recording studio. Jarmusch encouraged Young&#x27;s improvisational music, as it would add to the film&#x27;s spontaneous narrative. The soundtrack album consists of seven instrumental tracks by Young, with dialog excerpts from the film and Johnny Depp reading the poetry of William Blake interspersed between the music.

==In other media==
Gary Farmer makes a cameo appearance as Nobody in Jarmusch&#x27;s subsequent film &quot;Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai&quot;, in which he repeats one of his signature lines of dialogue, &quot;Stupid fucking white man!&quot;

Johnny Depp makes a brief cameo as William Blake in Mika Kaurismäki&#x27;s film &quot;L.A. Without a Map&quot;.

Rudy Wurlitzer&#x27;s unproduced screenplay &quot;Zebulon&quot; inspired Jarmusch&#x27;s film. Wurlitzer later rewrote the screenplay as the novel &quot;The Drop Edge of Yonder&quot; (2008).

<text>Arundel Castle is a restored and remodelled medieval castle in Arundel, West Sussex, England. It was established by Roger de Montgomery in the 11th century. The castle was damaged in the English Civil War and then restored in the 18th and early 19th centuries by Charles Howard, 11th Duke of Norfolk. Further restoration and embellishment was undertaken from the 1890s by Charles Alban Buckler for the 15th Duke.

Since the 11th century, the castle has been the seat of the Earls of Arundel and the Dukes of Norfolk. It is a Grade I listed building.

==History==
The original structure was a motte-and-bailey castle. Roger de Montgomery was declared the first Earl of Arundel as the King granted him the property as part of a much larger package of hundreds of manors. Roger, who was a cousin of William the Conqueror, had stayed in Normandy to keep the peace there while William was away in England. He was rewarded for his loyalty with extensive lands in the Welsh Marches and across the country, together with one fifth of Sussex (Arundel Rape). He began work on Arundel Castle in around 1067.

Between 1101 and 1102 the castle was besieged by the forces of Henry I after its holder Robert of Bellême rebelled. The siege ended with the castle surrendering to the king. The castle then passed to Adeliza of Louvain (who had previously been married to Henry I) and her husband William d&#x27;Aubigny. Empress Matilda stayed in the castle, in 1139. It then passed down the d&#x27;Aubigny line until the death of Hugh d&#x27;Aubigny, 5th Earl of Arundel in 1243. John Fitzalan then inherited &quot;jure matris&quot; the castle and honour of Arundel, by which, according to Henry VI&#x27;s &quot;admission&quot; of 1433, he was later retrospectively held to have become &quot;de jure&quot; Earl of Arundel.

The FitzAlan male line ceased on the death of Henry Fitzalan, 12th Earl of Arundel, whose daughter and heiress Mary FitzAlan married Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk in 1555, to whose descendants the castle and earldom passed.

In 1643, during the First English Civil War, the castle was besieged. The 800 royalists inside surrendered after 18 days. Afterwards in 1653 Parliament ordered the slighting of the castle; however &quot;weather probably destroyed more&quot;.

Although the castle remained in the hands of the Howard family over the succeeding centuries, it was not their favourite residence, and the various Dukes of Norfolk invested their time and energy into improving other ducal estates, including Norfolk House in London. Charles Howard, 11th Duke of Norfolk, was known for his restoration work and improvements to the castle beginning in 1787. The folly that still stands on the hill above Swanbourne Lake was commissioned by and built for the Duke by Francis Hiorne at this time.

In 1846, Queen Victoria and her husband, Prince Albert, visited Arundel Castle for three days. Henry Howard, 13th Duke of Norfolk, internally remodelled the castle in time for her visit. The architectural firm responsible for design of the furniture was named Morant. The work included a suite of six rooms, built on the second floor of the south-east range at this time.
After the 1846 Royal visit the 15th Duke began re-structuring the castle again from 1875 to 1905. The work, which was done to the designs of Charles Alban Buckler and undertaken by Rattee and Kett of Cambridge, was completed in the late 19th century. The 16th Duke had planned to give the castle to the National Trust but following his death in 1975 the 17th Duke cancelled the plan. He created an independent charitable trust to guarantee the castle&#x27;s future, and oversaw restorative works.

The extensive gardens had received significant improvements by early 2020 through the efforts of head gardener Martin Duncan and his crew. A horticulturalist and landscape designer, Duncan has been working at the Castle since 2009; in 2018, he received the Kew Guild Medal. The gardeners and volunteers &quot;have worked wonders with their bold and innovative plantings&quot;, according to an April 2020 report by &quot;Country Life&quot;. Their most recent efforts led to a wild water garden around the ponds.

== The Collector&#x27;s Earl Garden ==

Designed by Isabel and Julian Bannerman, The Collector&#x27;s Earl Garden was opened in 2008 by Charles, Prince of Wales as a tribute to Thomas Howard, 14th Earl of Arundel, known as ‘The Collector’. The garden&#x27;s centerpiece, Oberon&#x27;s Palace, is a stunning pavilion that features a shellwork grotto and a fountain that supports a golden corona when the water spurts.

==Cricket==
The cricket field in the castle grounds has, since 1895, seen matches involving teams from local youths to international sides.

==Other events==
* On 14 October 1651, Captain Morley, who held the Castle for Parliament, while out hunting, almost captured Charles II and Colonel Phillips. Charles II was on the run for his life at the time, fleeing from the Royalist defeat at Worcester. His party managed to just stay clear of Morley&#x27;s party by dismounting as if to descend the hill more easily, thereby letting Morley&#x27;s group run past them. (See Gounter, Last Act, p. 12.)
* The visit of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert (1846)
* The opening of the Collector Earl&#x27;s Garden 14 May 2008 by Charles, then Prince of Wales.
* On Friday 21 May 2021 there was a break-in. A set of &quot;irreplaceable&quot; gold rosary beads carried by Mary, Queen of Scots, to her execution in 1587 were among items stolen. Other items taken included coronation cups given by monarchs to the Earl Marshal.

==Filming location==
Arundel Castle has been used as a filming location for several television and film productions. The BBC filmed extensively at the castle and its grounds in 1988 for the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Silver Nemesis&quot;, where it doubled for Windsor Castle. It also doubled for Windsor Castle in the 1994 film &quot;The Madness of King George&quot;. Arundel Castle was also a location for the 2009 film &quot;The Young Victoria&quot;, and the 2017 film &quot;Wonder Woman&quot;.

==In literature==
In Thomas Malory&#x27;s epic &quot;Morte D&#x27;Arthur&quot;, Arundel Castle is the castle of Anglides, the mother of Alisander le Orphelin.

<text>Castle Rising is a ruined medieval fortification in the village of Castle Rising, Norfolk, England. It was built soon after 1138 by William d&#x27;Aubigny II, who had risen through the ranks of the Anglo-Norman nobility to become the Earl of Arundel. With his new wealth, he constructed Castle Rising and its surrounding deer park, a combination of fortress and palatial hunting lodge. It was inherited by William&#x27;s descendants before passing into the hands of the de Montalt family in 1243. The Montalts later sold the castle to Queen Isabella, who lived there after her fall from power in 1330. Isabella extended the castle buildings and enjoyed a regal lifestyle, entertaining her son, Edward III, on several occasions. After her death, it was granted to Edward, the Black Prince, to form part of the Duchy of Cornwall.

During the 15th century, the castle became increasingly valued for its hunting facilities rather than its military defences. It fell into disrepair and, despite the construction of new living quarters and service facilities, by the middle of the 16th century it was derelict. Henry VIII sold the property to Thomas Howard, the Duke of Norfolk, and most of the castle buildings were demolished. It was not until the 19th century, when Mary and Fulke Greville Howard inherited the property, that the castle was renovated and restored. Victorian scholars examined the site, and it was opened to the public. In 1958 the castle passed into the custody of the state, which carried out further stabilisation work and a programme of archaeological investigation. In 1998 English Heritage passed the management of the site back to its current owner, Baron Howard of Rising, who continues to operate the castle as a tourist attraction.

Castle Rising comprises three baileys, each defended by large earthworks, covering a total area of , which archaeologists Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham consider to be among the most impressive in Britain. In the inner bailey is the great keep, probably modelled on that of Norwich Castle. It features extensive Romanesque designs, including pilaster buttresses and arcading. Historians Beric Morley and David Gurney believe this to be &quot;one of the finest of all Norman keeps&quot;, and its military utility and political symbolism have been extensively discussed by academics. The castle was originally surrounded by a carefully managed landscape, from the planned town in front of the castle, to the deer park and rabbit warrens that stretched out behind it, intended to be viewed from the lord&#x27;s chamber in the great keep.

==History==

===12th – 13th centuries===

Castle Rising was built soon after 1138 by William d&#x27;Aubigny II, an upwardly mobile Anglo-Norman noble who owned the surrounding manor of Snettisham. William married Adeliza of Louvain, the widow of King Henry I in that year, and became the Earl of Arundel in 1139. This transformed his social position, and one chronicler at Waltham Holy Cross complained how he &quot;became intolerably puffed up ... and looked down upon every other eminence in the world except the King&quot;. With his new wealth, William built Castle Rising and New Buckenham Castle in Norfolk, and expanded Arundel Castle in West Sussex.

The castle was located from the port of King&#x27;s Lynn. In the 12th century it would have typically have been reached by boat, through a channel in the marshy Babingley River that ran nearby. Following the Norman Conquest of England, the land had been granted to Bishop Odo, the Earl of Kent, who may have used it as an administrative centre; there were many Saxo-Norman buildings on the site of the later castle. Although Norfolk was a prosperous region during this period, the location of the castle was not strategically important: its only militarily significance would have been as a regional muster point, and the surrounding lands were thinly populated, with poor, acidic agricultural soil. The attraction of the site to William is believed to have been that it was a relatively cheap and easy place in which to build a substantial new building and establish a large hunting park. Historian Richard Hulme argues that William essentially built &quot;a palatial hunting lodge&quot; on the site.

Massive resources were required to construct Castle Rising, which included three baileys with large earthwork defences and a stone keep, with an adjacent deer park just behind the castle. As part of the project, the existing settlement was moved away to the north, where it became a planned settlement adjacent to the new castle. A pre-existing Norman chapel on the site, built around 1100, was encircled by the castle defences, and the new parish church of St Lawrence was built in the town instead, although it is possible that this church also pre-dates the castle. William received permission from King Stephen to open a mint at the castle in 1145 and, probably linked to this development, settled a community of Jews in the town.
It is uncertain how often William actually stayed at his new castle. He and his wife probably preferred to reside in their estates around Arundel in the south of England, and both William and his descendants chose New Buckenham Castle, rather than Castle Rising, to serve as the &quot;caput&quot;, or main castle, for their Norfolk landholdings.

A prolonged civil war known as the Anarchy broke out in England from 1138 until 1154, between the followers of King Stephen and the Empress Matilda, only ending when Matilda&#x27;s son, Henry II, finally inherited the kingdom. Despite William having backed Stephen during the war, after the end of the conflict he proved a loyal supporter of Henry and was allowed to retain his possessions. Henry clamped down on the operation of the regional mints, however, and closed the facility at Castle Rising; the local Jews resettled in King&#x27;s Lynn. A second, rapid phase of construction work on the castle then occurred, probably in the 1170s in response to a major rebellion against Henry II. William supported the King, and fought against the rebels at the Battle of Fornham in neighbouring Suffolk. Around this time the height of the earth defences was doubled and the internal level of the west bailey raised to form a platform.

The castle was inherited by William d&#x27;Albini III, and in turn by his son, William IV, and grandson, William V. William V died in 1224, leaving it to his brother Hugh. Probably by this time the chapel inside the castle walls had fallen out of use as a religious building, and was instead employed for secular purposes. The top of the keep&#x27;s walls are distinctively different from the rest of the building, and one theory to explain this is that the castle keep was not in fact completed during William II&#x27;s lifetime, and that the final work on walls was carried out between 1200 and 1230 by his descendants. Hugh died childless in 1243, and the castle then passed to Roger de Montalt.

===14th century===

The Montalts were a prominent baronial family, but they had few other estates in the region and their family fortunes declined. In 1327, Roger de Montalt&#x27;s younger brother, Robert, who was childless, sold the reversion of his rights in the castle to the Crown in 1327 for 10,000 marks – effectively selling it to the Crown with a life-time lease for him and his wife Emma. An alternative theory to explain the different style of stonework along the top of the keep is that the building was completed under William d&#x27;Albini II, but had become dilapidated by the start of the 14th century, requiring extensive repairs by Robert. The forebuilding of the keep was raised in height at one end around this time and a new, peaked roof added to it, and an imposing, timber-framed, brick kitchen was built in the inner bailey.

At the time of Robert&#x27;s agreement with the Crown, the government of England was controlled by Roger Mortimer and Queen Isabella of France, who was ruling as regent in the name of her young son, Edward III. Isabella fell from power when Edward toppled Mortimer in a coup d&#x27;état in 1330, but after a short period of house arrest she led a relatively normal life, enjoying considerable status as the King&#x27;s mother. Edward granted Isabella several royal castles in England, including Castle Rising. Robert had died in 1329 and in 1331 Emma sold her rights to the castle to Isabella for £400.

From then on, Isabella used Castle Rising as one of her main residences until her death in 1358. Isabella was a wealthy woman, as the King granted her a yearly income of £3,000, which by 1337 had increased to £4,000. She enjoyed a regal lifestyle in Norfolk, maintaining minstrels, huntsmen and grooms, and received visits from Edward and the royal household on at least four occasions. Despite her large income, Isabella ran up long-standing debts with the local merchants near the castle. Around the time that she took over the castle, a new set of buildings were constructed in the central bailey, including a west range containing a residential suite, a new private chapel, and a south range linking to various service buildings; the existing kitchen was reused. The great hall was reroofed, although Isabella lived in the west range, using the keep only for formal occasions or as accommodation for very senior guests. A brick wall around the outside of the inner bailey may have been built around this time to provide additional security.

The castle then passed to Isabella&#x27;s grandson, Edward the Black Prince. Edward III had decreed in 1337 that his son would inherit the castle after Isabella&#x27;s death, complete with the surrounding manor and the right to part of the tolls from King&#x27;s Lynn, although these brought in only a relatively modest £100 a year. As part of this arrangement, the King declared the castle to be a permanent part of the Duchy of Cornwall, an estate traditionally assigned for the use of the Prince of Wales. The Prince undertook repairs to the castle during the 1360s, including spending £81 on repairing the &quot;Nightegale Tower&quot; in 1365, although it is uncertain which part of the castle this refers to. The Prince died in 1376, returning the Duchy of Cornwall to the control of the Crown, and during this time Castle Rising appears to have been maintained in good condition. It was ordered on several occasions during the 1380s to raise local forces to counter the threat of a French invasion, and may have been equipped with two cannons. If not built by Isabella, the brick wall around the inner bailey may have been constructed during this period.

Under Richard II, the rights to the castle changed hands several times, despite Edward&#x27;s charter having made it a permanent part of the Duchy. Richard&#x27;s government gave the castle to John, the Duke of Brittany, in 1378, in exchange for the Château de Brest. Richard subsequently gave the reversion of the castle first to his uncle Thomas, Duke of Gloucester, in 1386, and then to another uncle, Edmund, Duke of York in 1397. Shortly after Richard was overthrown, the courts declared these grants to have been illegal, and returned the castle to the Duchy in 1403, then in the possession of the future Henry V.

===15th – 18th centuries===

In the 15th and early 16th centuries, Castle Rising continued to be owned by the Duchy of Cornwall. Although the castle&#x27;s military defences were mobilised by Henry VI in 1461 during the Wars of the Roses, it became increasingly more prominent as a hunting facility. The role of the constable of the castle was often combined with that of the surveyor or ranger of Rising Chase, the parkland around the castle. The castle may have been a prestigious location during this period, although its facilities were not as extensive as those of other castles and manors known for their hunting. Senior visitors to the castle included Mary Tudor, Queen of France, and Charles Brandon, the Duke of Suffolk, and its constables included nobles such as Lord Ralph de Cromwell and John de Vere, the Earl of Oxford.

Minor repairs on the castle were carried out during the period, including to the castle bridge, but the state of the property gradually declined. The old kitchens were removed in the early 15th century, and a new, larger facility constructed in their place. Once built, however, the new kitchens, along with the rest of the buildings in the inner bailey, were left to deteriorate. Reports in 1482 stated that the buildings were no longer weatherproof, and a survey carried around between 1503 and 1506 described the castle as &quot;evyll repayred&quot;, and noted that the roof of the keep was rotten. This last survey urged that existing repair works on the buildings in the bailey be completed, but suggested that it might not be worth repairing the keep because of the excessive cost.
Despite these challenges, fresh construction work was carried out around this time. The southern range and the kitchen were pulled down, and replaced with a new set of lodgings for guests, complete with stables, although the resulting buildings were not particularly robust. Problems reappeared, and a survey between 1542 and 1543 noted that, with the exception of the new lodgings, the castle was in &quot;greate ruin and decaye&quot;. The roof of the keep had by now collapsed, as probably had the floors of the great hall and chamber. The survey costed the necessary repairs to the crumbling walls around the inner bailey at £100. At around this time, the forebuilding of the keep was adapted to form a separate, smaller, set of chambers, and at some point after this a passageway was dug out of the walls to link these to the kitchens in the keep, by-passing the now floor-less rooms of the keep.

In 1544 Henry VIII bequeathed the castle to Thomas Howard, the Duke of Norfolk, but the property continued to decline. By the 1570s the castle and its earthworks had been allowed to become infested with rabbits, whose warrens caused extensive damage; a survey suggested that fully renovating the castle would cost £2,000, and that even if it were pulled down and sold for the value of its materials, it would only realise £66. At the end of the century, the inner bailey was finally cleared of most of its buildings; the new lodgings were pulled down, along with most of the west range and the old Norman chapel, leaving only the ruined keep, alongside the latrines and the newer chapel, although what these last two were then used for is uncertain. The foundations of the old chapel were slowly covered up by the earth defences.

During the 17th century, the ground floor of the keep – made of hardened gravel – was dug up, probably to reuse for surfacing roads or pathways. The apartments in the forebuilding were abandoned and this part of the keep fell into decay as well. In 1644, the lands surrounding the castle were disparked, bringing an end to Castle Rising Chase. In 1705 stone was stripped from the castle to help repair a nearby sluice gate.

===19th – 21st centuries===

Castle Rising continued to be owned by the Howard family, and in the 19th century it was inherited by Mary Howard, and her husband Fulke Greville Howard. Fulke began to undertake restoration work, excavating the basement of the keep in 1822 and repairing some of the stonework. The ground level of the inner bailey, which had built up over the years, was lowered by about : according to the contemporary archaeologist Henry Harrod, this process required thousands of loads of earth to be dug out and removed. A great deal of medieval archaeological evidence was destroyed in the process, but the work uncovered the old Norman chapel and Harrod excavated the building in 1851. Mary continued the excavation work on the castle site after Fulke&#x27;s death, and restored the stonework of the chapel.

Initially the chapel was believed to be of Anglo-Saxon origin and to have been buried under the earthworks when they were first constructed. An argument then ensued between the antiquarian William Taylor, who championed the Anglo-Saxon dating for the site, and Harrod, who insisted that the chapel was in fact Norman in origin; the issue was not settled until later in the 20th century, when the Norman date was confirmed. By 1900 the castle was open to the public, overseen by a caretaker who lived in one corner of the keep, the section of which had been reroofed and turned into an apartment.

By 1958 the castle&#x27;s condition had deteriorated and the Ministry of Works took legal custody of the site, although it continued to be owned by the Howard family. Conservation work took place during the 1960s, stabilising the stonework of the keep. Archaeological investigations were then carried out, focusing on the keep in 1970, the church and the earthwork defences during 1971 and 1972, and the inner bailey from 1973 to 1976. This research centred on archaeological excavations and the recording of remains; as with similar castles investigated during this period, the site was then preserved as a monument, and grass lawns laid down around the remaining stonework and foundations. Further excavations were carried out in 1987 during the construction of the ticket office beside the castle.

English Heritage took over control of the castle in 1983 and continued to operate it as a tourist attraction. In the 21st century the castle is protected by UK law as an ancient monument and a Grade I listed building. It remains in the custody of English Heritage, but since 1998 has been managed by its owner, Baron Howard of Rising.

==Architecture and landscape==

===Landscape===

The fortification of Castle Rising was constructed in a carefully designed landscape. In front of the castle was the town of Castle Rising, moved to its new site when the castle was built. The settlement appears to have been laid out to a grid-plan design, possibly bounded by ditches; with the castle positioned just behind it, in a similar fashion to that at New Buckenham and Malton Castle. A dovecot and a religious house were founded nearby; both of these were important symbols of lordship at the time, and were considered essential parts of a properly established castle.

The castle&#x27;s deer park, which merged into the larger Rising Chase, was positioned behind the castle in a similar way to that at Devizes Castle. The castle effectively formed an interface between the town and the park; the great hall in the keep faced the settlement, and the lord&#x27;s chamber overlooked the park, creating a symbolic divide between the public and private aspects of the building.

Rising Chase was around in circumference, enclosing around . It utilised marginal farm-land, which may have contributed to its design; the heathland and light woodland south of the castle would have been ideal for grazing deer. The park was also designed with aesthetics in mind, being shaped so that its boundaries stretched beyond the horizon when viewed from the keep, in a similar design to that at Framlingham, Ludgershall and Okehampton Castles. Indeed, while the park would originally have provided the castle venison and other products, it was probably more ornamental than practical in character, including a space of open grazing in the centre of the park, designed to be visible from the castle chamber. The castle also incorporated a large rabbit warren, an important source of food and fur in this period, which stretched away south-west from the castle.

===Architecture===

====Baileys====

Castle Rising is made up of two rectangular baileys to the west and east, and an oval inner bailey in the middle, each with their own substantial earthwork defences and ditches. The earthworks of Castle Rising cover a total area of , and are considered by archaeologists Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham to be among the most impressive in Britain. The interior of the western bailey has been levelled up to form a platform, and is no longer directly connected to the rest of the castle. The eastern bailey is by across, and formed a protective buffer, covering the entrance way to the inner bailey.

A stone bridge connects the eastern bailey to the inner bailey, and is across, still retaining some of its original stonework at its base, although the remainder of it has since been rebuilt many times. The bridge leads onto a stone gatehouse, dating from around 1138; when it was first built it was substantially taller and longer than today. It was originally equipped with a portcullis, and a stone barbican was later built outside it for additional protection.

Beyond the gatehouse is the inner bailey, which forms a ringwork by in size, with a circumference of ; the banks are now high from the bottom of the defensive ditch, although they were originally only half this height. It is uncertain what was placed around the top of this bank when it first built; there may have been a wooden palisade, or possibly a timber revetment. Some of the remains of the 14th-century brick wall, built on an additional layer of limed sand for stability, have survived along part of the bank. There were three towers built along the walls during the medieval period, two of which have left their mark in the earth banks; the location of the third is uncertain.
The main architectural focus of the inner bailey was the great keep, but it also contained a Norman chapel and, from at least the 14th century onwards, a complex of smaller residential and service buildings. The visible stone foundations on the north side of the keep belong to the chapel and range built for Queen Isabella around 1330. The bailey well can also still be seen.

On the north side of the bailey are the remains of the Norman chapel, which comprised a nave, a square tower and an apsidal chancel, 12.7 metres by 6 metres (42 ft by 20 ft), 4 metres square (13 ft square) and 4.6 metres by 4 metres (15 ft by 13 ft) respectively. It was built from local grey sandstone, and Roman tiles from one of the nearby villas were used to construct its roof and incorporated into the walls. Originally the tower would have had a church bell, and the casting pit for this is buried under the floor of the nave. A stone bench runs around the base of the walls, and in the 19th century there was also a stone base for a font in the nave, but this has since been lost. A piece of early medieval graffiti, possibly depicting a Norman soldier, has survived on the south exterior wall. A fireplace was added to the chapel during the Tudor period, although this was only in use for a few years before being abandoned.

====Keep====
Historians Beric Morley and David Gurney consider Castle Rising to have &quot;one of the finest of all Norman keeps&quot;. It is an early example of the longer, oblong form of these buildings, called a hall-keep, and would have taken huge resources to erect. Externally, it resembles Henry I&#x27;s keeps at Norwich and Falaise, although Norwich appears to have inspired the latter design, and Rising&#x27;s internal layout was probably based on that at Norwich as well. In imitating Norwich, which was then the only royal castle in the county, Castle Rising may have been intended to symbolise D&#x27;Albini&#x27;s loyalty to the Crown during the troubled years of the Anarchy.

The keep is built from courses of local, brown carrstone rubble with oolite ashlar facings, and is strengthened with intramural timbers, laid down within the stone walls to reinforce the structure. Its main body is by wide, with walls approximately high, with a forebuilding running along the east side. It has prominent pilaster buttresses, giving the keep what Sidney Toy describes as an &quot;impression of strength and dignity&quot;; the corners have clasping buttresses, forming four turrets. There is extensive Romanesque detail on the outside of the keep, including arcading along the west side and decorative stonework on the forebuilding.

The interior of the keep is divided by an internal wall to improve its structural strength, the division running north–south through the building. The basement of the keep has two main sections, the north room by , with pillars supporting the great hall above, and the south chamber by in size. The forebuilding leads from the ground to the first floor, up a passageway wide with 34 steps and through three arched doorways. At the top is a waiting room; the glazed windows are a mixture of Tudor and more modern insertions.

On the first floor is the great hall, by , now floorless and open to the sky. Its original entrance way was blocked up by a chimney when the forebuilding was converted into a separate apartment in the Tudor period, and an additional entrance way inserted into the castle wall. The fireplace itself was later filled in with Tudor tiles around 1840. A mural passageway, dug out in the Tudor period, leads through to the kitchen and service quarters. On the southern side is the great chamber with a large, original 12th-century fireplace, and a mixture of original tri-lobed windows and 19th-century additions. At the far end of the great chamber is an ornate chapel, with Norman arcading and arching. The keep was originally built to have been relatively self-contained, and would not have needed many additional outbuildings to function as a residence.

The second floor of the keep is limited in space, and contains only one small room above the chapel which was possibly used the chaplain or by castle guards. The forebuilding was later equipped with an additional room on this level, by , which remained inhabited longer than the rest of the castle keep, and which contains a 19th-century fireplace. The upper of the keep&#x27;s walls are different in design to the main body of the building; as described above, this may be the result of either a final phase of construction between 1200 and 1230, or a period of repair and renovation shortly after 1300.

===Utility and symbolism===
Many 20th-century historians have stressed the potential military strength of Castle Rising; R. Allen Brown, for example, concluded that &quot;defence ... was the overwhelming consideration in [its] design and construction&quot;, and argued that the keep would have been used as a final refuge in the case of attack during a siege. Beric Morley and David Gurney believe that the military strength of the castle could not have failed to impress contemporaries. Sidney Toy suggested that the forebuilding would have made an effective defensive feature, enabling the defenders to attack intruders as they made their way up the stairs, with Morley and Gurney describing it as &quot;a deadly and near impregnable approach to the castle&#x27;s interior&quot;.

Despite this, the defensive qualities of Castle Rising have since been extensively debated. The historian Robert Liddiard argues that the large windows at Castle Rising would have been a significant weakness, as it would have been easy to fire arrows through them from the bailey, and George Garnett has questioned the utility of the defensive arrow slits, which he suggests were not well positioned or designed. The whole site was also overlooked by higher ground, which Liddiard considers would have been a key defensive weakness.

Great keeps such as Castle Rising&#x27;s were also important ceremonially and symbolically in the 12th century, however, and historian Thomas Heslop has described Castle Rising as &quot;a fortress palace&quot;, with the keep forming the palace, and the surrounding earthworks the more practical defences. They reflected lordly status: typically their owners had recently advanced up the social scale, as with William d&#x27;Aubigny, and were keen to impress others with their new authority.

With this in mind, the positioning of Castle Rising may have exposed it to higher ground, but it also made it strikingly prominent across the valley. The whole entrance to the castle was also designed to communicate to a visitor the status of the castle lord. As they came through the gatehouse and past the earthworks into the bailey, the south side of the forebuilding - deliberately facing the entrance - would have been revealed, covered in fashionable carving and decorative features. Visitors would then have walked up the stairs of the forebuilding, have paused in a waiting room, originally largely open to the elements, before being allowed through a decorative entrance door. The doorway led into the great hall, from where the lord, possibly sat in a throne alcove to the left, would have met the visitor.

<doc id="113657" wikidata="Q356333" url="?curid=113657" title="Geothermal power in Iceland">
<text>Geothermal power in Iceland refers to the use of geothermal energy in Iceland for electricity generation.

Iceland&#x27;s uniquely active geology has led to natural conditions especially suitable for harnessing geothermal energy. Icelanders have long used geothermal energy for direct applications, such as heating homes and baths. The more recent, widespread adoption of geothermal energy as an energy source in Iceland was spawned by a need to stabilize energy prices and increase energy independence, allowing Iceland to increase reliance on geothermal energy for direct applications alongside electricity generation and contributing significantly to diminishing Iceland&#x27;s carbon footprint.

The growth of geothermal power in Iceland is due to its continued support from the Icelandic government. As of 2020, Iceland’s installed geothermal power production capacity is 799 megawatts (MW). Geothermal energy produces over a quarter of Iceland&#x27;s total electricity.

== Geology ==
Iceland&#x27;s territory is some of the most geologically active on Earth. The country straddles the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (a rift between continental plates), and lies over a volcanic hotspot. This combination of factors has led to pronounced volcanism and geothermal activity. Furthermore, the island also possesses underground water reservoirs continually replenished by rain. Magma underneath the island heats these reservoirs to hundreds of degrees Fahrenheit. At least 25 such geothermal aquifers lie within the volcanic zone. These natural conditions in Iceland are favorable for geothermal power production.

== History ==

=== Geothermal energy in Iceland ===

Geothermal energy has been employed by Icelanders since the Viking Age, with initial uses including washing and bathing. Later, it began to be used to heat homes, greenhouses, and swimming pools, as well as to keep streets and sidewalks free of snow and ice. Today, at least 90% of all homes in Iceland are heated with geothermal energy.

The Blue Lagoon is a prominent example of a geothermal bath. With a mix of seawater and discharge freshwater from the nearby Svartsengi Power Station, the Blue Lagoon is 5,000 square meters in size and is Iceland&#x27;s most popular tourist attraction.

While geothermal energy has had many uses in Iceland throughout history, its use there for electricity generation did not come until relatively recently. Iceland&#x27;s power was largely derived from fossil fuels until the 1970s, when the national government looked to address energy price inequities across the country. A report commissioned in 1970 by the country&#x27;s National Energy Authority, Orkustofnun, recommended increased domestic production of geothermal power and hydroelectricity to stabilize energy prices and reduce the nation&#x27;s reliance on external energy resources. In 1973, an international energy crisis began, subjecting Iceland to highly volatile oil prices and an uncertain energy market. The crisis sparked Iceland&#x27;s government to ramp up adoption of the domestic power sources identified by the National Energy Authority&#x27;s report. The ensuing rapid growth of renewable energy production mostly originated from a geopolitical desire for energy independence and was catalyzed by the urgent economic constraints during the 1970s energy crisis. Since then, in addition to increasing Iceland&#x27;s energy independence, it has also resulted in the widespread decarbonization of the country&#x27;s electric grid.

=== Government policy ===
Iceland&#x27;s government policies strongly encourage the usage of renewable energy resources in power production. These policies stem from energy issues that the country had faced in years past; in the 1970s, for example, Iceland&#x27;s government responded to increasing oil prices by replacing oil with geothermal energy in district heating. As a result, the cost of heating was decreased significantly, and compared to most other countries, was much lower.

As progress continued on geothermal energy projects and investments, the National Energy Authority laid out their master plan to implement the use of geothermal energy in two phases. The first phase was conducted during 1999–2003, which primarily focused on data gathering. The second phase was conducted during 2004–2009, where the first half of those years was spent on further research and the second half spent on evaluating geothermal fields. A total of 24 potential geothermal projects were considered under the master plan. Today, many of these projects are still under consideration by the Icelandic Parliament.

The government still faces issues with providing all households with accessibility to geothermal power, as there remain villages and rural areas that lack geothermal heating infrastructure. To combat this issue, Iceland&#x27;s government is continuously engaging in exploration activities for the villages and rural areas to explore possible locations for geothermal energy infrastructure. In 2019, the construction of a 20-km hot water transmission pipeline from a geothermal field to the town of Höfn was constructed to replace electricity as their source of heating for 1,800 people.

Iceland&#x27;s government has also put effort into foreign policies and investments that encourage other nations to harness renewable energy such as geothermal power. One of Iceland&#x27;s foreign efforts is the African Rift Geothermal Development Facility Project, which began in 2010, and is performed in partnership with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in countries such as Ethiopia, Kenya and Rwanda. Iceland has also helped train geothermal engineers from around the world through the United Nations University Geothermal Training Programme.

==Consumption==

As Iceland is situated in a highly geothermal location, 70.38% of total energy used in the country comes from geothermal sources as of 2020. This means of the total of primary energy used by Iceland in 2020 is from a geothermal source. The geothermal energy is then used in two main ways: direct application and indirectly via electricity generation.

=== Direct applications ===
Most geothermal energy in Iceland is used for heating activities. As of 2020, the primary use of geothermal heat is space heating ), followed by heated swimming pools ), snow melting , fish farming , greenhouses , and industry usage . As these uses are reliant solely on geothermal heat, they do not result in the energy losses that come with generating electricity. Instead, many of these direct applications use water as the means of transmission. In Iceland&#x27;s capital Reykjavík, hot water from 100° to 300°C is used to heat homes, then piped into plastic tubing underneath streets and sidewalks at to melt snow and ice.

=== Electricity generation ===
Iceland has recently been self-sufficient in producing electricity, consistently meeting or exceeding electricity demand in the country mainly through geothermal and hydropower generation. In 2020, 99.94% of electricity in Iceland was produced by hydro and geothermal means, with 13,157 and 5,961 gigawatt hours (GWh) produced respectively. Geothermal energy accounts for over a quarter of Iceland&#x27;s electric power production.

However, after the droughts in the summer season of 2021, low reservoir levels for hydropower generation along with increasing electricity demand in the nation led to an electricity supply crunch. To suppress electricity demand, the Icelandic government had to cut back electricity from certain industries. This supply crunch caused by fluctuations in hydropower generation has Iceland considering the expansion of power generation infrastructure.

==Electricity production infrastructure==
According to the National Energy Authority of Iceland, in 2020, Iceland&#x27;s geothermal facilities had in total an installed capacity of 799 MWe, making up 25.9% of all power capacity in Iceland, besides hydropower, wind, and fossil fuels.

According to Askja Energy Partners, an energy consulting firm in Iceland, the three entities that own and operate the largest geothermal power stations in Iceland are HS Orka, ON Power, and Landsvirkjun (National Power Company of Iceland).

The following are nine power plants that contribute the most to Iceland&#x27;s geothermal power production capacity; the ownership of each geothermal power plant is also noted:

In Reykjavík, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) emitted from two nearby geothermal power plants, Hellisheiði and Nesjavellir, may have impacted residents&#x27; health. Research conducted by the University of Iceland in 2012 found that weather events favorable for H2S concentrations in Reykjavík greater than the national 24-hour health limit of 50 μg m−3 can be expected to occur twice a year on average.

Iceland is also investing in geothermal energy research projects like the Iceland Deep Drilling Project (IDDP). If successful, the technology being developed by IDDP could produce ten times more power than current geothermal power technology. By drilling more than 15,000 feet (4.5 km) deep into the volcanic fields in Iceland&#x27;s Reykjanes Peninsula, researchers are hoping to investigate the use of supercritical fluids for harnessing geothermal energy. If achieved, projects like IDDP will allow a greater portion of Iceland&#x27;s electricity to be generated by geothermal means.

<text>Batu Caves is a mogote with a series of limestone caves in Gombak, Selangor, Malaysia. It is located about north of the capital city of Kuala Lumpur. The cave complex contains many Hindu temples, the most popular of which is a shrine dedicated to the deity Murugan. It is the focal point of the Tamil Hindu festival of Thaipusam in Malaysia. The complex also hosts a high Murugan statue, one of the largest Murugan statues in the world.

== Etymology ==
The name for the cave complex is derived from the Batu Pahat River which flows nearby. The word &quot;batu&quot; is derived from Malay meaning &quot;rock&quot;. The hill was called as &quot;Kapal Tanggang&quot; (ship of Si Tanggang) as per &quot;Si Tanggang&quot;, the Malay version of the Minang folktale &quot;Malin Kundang&quot;. In Tamil, the temple complex is called as &quot;Pathu malai&quot; (பத்து மலை).

==History==
The caves were used as shelters by the indigenous Temuan people, a tribe of Orang Asli. In the 1860s, Chinese settlers began excavating guano from the caves, used as fertilisers. In 1878, the caves were visited by American naturalist William Hornaday. K. Thamboosamy, an Indian Tamil trader, promoted the cave complex as a site of Hindu worship. A Hindu temple dedicated to lord Murugan was completed in 1891 with the annual Thaipusam celebrations commencing in 1892. Further development of religious sites has happened ever since in the region. Housing development around the region began in the late 20th century with non-governmental organisations expressing concerns about the over-development.

== Geology ==

The complex is a mogote with a series of limestone caves, formed more than 400 million years ago. It consists of a complex cave system of 20 recognized caves including four large cave systems with multiple inter-connected chambers. 

The speleothems were formed by the action of water falling on the surface percolating through the surface and interacting with the sub-surface, resulting in the dissolution of limestone rocks, resulting in the formation of stalactites and stalagmites. Stalactites jutting from the ceiling and stalagmites rising from the floor form intricate formations of cave curtains, flowstones, cave pearls, and scallops. The interiors would have been damp and wet when the caves were being formed.

== Biodiversity ==
The Batu cave system and its caverns is a biodiversity hotspot consisting of many plant and animal species, many of which are specific to such limestone environments. About 269 species of vascular plants including 56 species (21%) of calciphiles have been recorded from the site. There are a diverse range of cave fauna, including endemic species such as the trapdoor spider &quot;Liphistius batuensis&quot;. There are 21 species of bats, including several species of fruit bats. The dark cave system is home to numerous species of insects including haplotaxids, spiders, mites, ticks, scorpions, springtails, beetles, flies, ants, wasps, bees, butterflies, moths and other animals such as frogs, lizards, snakes and snails.

The site is also home to numerous long-tailed macaques. The monkeys often depend on people for food and might cause disturbance or nuisance. To preserve the cave&#x27;s ecology, access is restricted in the inner cave complex which can be accessed by the educational trips organised by the Malaysian Nature Society. Development over the years, industrial activity, and the high number of footfalls due to the religious site are threats to the biodiversity in the region.

== Religious site ==

The similarity of the entrance to the cave structure to a &quot;vel&quot; (a spear) wielded by the deity Murugan is said to have inspired Thamboosamy to build a temple. The Subramanian Swamy temple is located in the largest cave in the complex. Initially, the hill has to be climbed on foot to reach the shrine. In 1920, wooden steps were installed to enable the pilgrims to reach the temple. In the 1930s, the stairs began to show signs of wear and a decision was made to build concrete steps on the southern side of the cave complex. In 1940, 272 concrete steps were constructed, which exist to date. In August 2018, the steps were re-painted with each set of particular number of steps painted in a different color. In 2024, plans were unveiled to build a multi-purpose hall in the foothills and an escalator to the temple.

At the base of the hill are two caves, Art Gallery Cave and Museum Cave, which form the Cave Villa complex. These consist of statues and paintings from Hindu mythology, most of them relating to the life and stories of Murugan. The Ramayana Cave is situated to the left, which consists of paintings from the Hindu epic &quot;Ramayana&quot;. There is a tall statue of Hanuman at the entrance and a temple dedicated to Hanuman, opened in November 2001. 

To the right of the steps which serve as an entrance to the cave complex, a tall statue of Murugan was unveiled in January 2006. Painted in gold, it is the amongst the tallest Murugan statue in the world and the tallest statue in Malaysia.

==Thaipusam festival==
The Batu Caves serve as the focal point of the yearly Thaipusam () festival, celebrated by Tamil Hindus. The temple attracts thousands of people for the elaborate festivities. Kavadi Aattam is a ceremonial act of sacrifice and offering practiced by devotees, which forms a central part of the festival. &quot;Kavadi&quot; (meaning &quot;burden&quot; in Tamil) itself is a physical burden, which usually consists of two semicircular pieces of wood or steel which are bent and attached to a cross structure in its simplest form, that is balanced on the shoulders of the devotee and signifies a form of debt bondage. Worshipers often carry pot(s) of cow milk as an offering (&quot;paal kudam&quot;). The most extreme and spectacular practice is the carrying of &quot;Vel kavadi&quot;, a portable altar decorated with peacock feathers and flowers, that is attached to the body of the devotee through multiple skewers and metal hooks pierced into the skin on the chest and back. 

People also do a form of mortification of the flesh by piercing the skin, tongue or cheeks with &quot;vel&quot; skewers and flagellation. Vibuthi, a type of holy ash is spread across the body including the piercing sites. Drumming and chanting of verses help the devotees enter a state of trance. Devotees usually prepare for the rituals by keeping clean, doing regular prayers, following a vegetarian diet and fasting while remaining celibate for 48 days. A procession begins in the morning on Thaipusam from the Sri Mahamariamman Temple, Kuala Lumpur. A silver chariot weighing carrying the idols of Murugan with his consorts Valli and Deivanai is taken along the procession, accompanied by the devotees. After ritual bathing in the nearby Sungai Batu River, the devotees make their way to the temple.

==Rock climbing==
The cave complex which exists on a hillock is a place for rock climbing. There are nearly 160 climbing routes on the north-eastern side of the cave complex, called Damai caves. The routes are scattered across the sides with hills rising to . These climbing routes can be accessed from the ground level with abseiling and spelunking trips organized by local companies.

== Transportation ==
Batu Caves can be reached by taking the commuter train from KL Sentral in Kuala Lumpur to the Batu Caves Komuter station. Batu Caves may also be reached by bus 11 from Bangkok Bank stop near Central Market. Batu Caves can also be reached by car.

<text>Cardiff Castle () is a medieval castle and Victorian Gothic revival mansion located in the city centre of Cardiff, Wales. The original motte and bailey castle was built in the late 11th century by Norman invaders on top of a 3rd-century Roman fort. The castle was commissioned either by William the Conqueror or by Robert Fitzhamon, and formed the heart of the medieval town of Cardiff and the Marcher Lord territory of Glamorgan. In the 12th century the castle began to be rebuilt in stone, probably by Robert of Gloucester, with a shell keep and substantial defensive walls being erected. Further work was conducted by the 6th Earl of Gloucester in the second half of the 13th century. Cardiff Castle was repeatedly involved in the conflicts between the Anglo-Normans and the Welsh, being attacked several times in the 12th century, and stormed in 1404 during the revolt of Owain Glyndŵr.

After being held by the de Clare and Despenser families for several centuries, the castle was acquired by the 13th Earl of Warwick in 1423. Warwick conducted extensive work on the castle, founding the main lodgings on the west side of the castle, dominated by a tall octagonal tower. Following the Wars of the Roses, the status of the castle as a Marcher territory was revoked and its military significance began to decline. The Herbert family took over the property in 1550, remodelling parts of the main lodgings and carrying out construction work in the outer bailey, then occupied by Cardiff&#x27;s Shire Hall and other buildings. During the English Civil War Cardiff Castle was initially taken by a Parliamentary force, but was regained by Royalist supporters in 1645. When fighting broke out again in 1648, a Royalist army attacked Cardiff in a bid to regain the castle, leading to the Battle of St Fagans just outside the city. Cardiff Castle escaped potential destruction by Parliament after the war and was instead garrisoned, probably to protect against a possible Scottish invasion.

In the mid-18th century, Cardiff Castle passed into the hands of the Stuart dynasty, Marquesses of Bute. The 1st Marquess of Bute employed Capability Brown and Henry Holland to renovate the main lodgings, turning it into a Georgian mansion, and to landscape the castle grounds, demolishing many of the older medieval buildings and walls. During the first half of the 19th century the family became extremely wealthy as a result of the growth of the coal industry in Glamorgan. However, it was the 3rd Marquess of Bute who truly transformed the castle, using his vast wealth to back an extensive programme of renovations under William Burges. Burges remodelled the castle in a Gothic revival style, lavishing money and attention on the main lodgings. The resulting interior designs are considered to be amongst &quot;the most magnificent that the gothic revival ever achieved&quot;. The grounds were re-landscaped and, following the discovery of the old Roman remains, reconstructed walls and a gatehouse in a Roman style were incorporated into the castle design. Extensive landscaped parks were built around the outside of the castle.

In the early 20th century, the 4th Marquess of Bute inherited the castle and construction work continued into the 1920s. The Bute lands and commercial interests around Cardiff were sold off or nationalised until, by the time of the Second World War, little was left except the castle. During the war, extensive air raid shelters were built in the castle walls; they could hold up to 1,800 people. When the 4th Marquess died in 1947, the castle was given to the City of Cardiff. Today the castle is run as a tourist attraction, with the grounds housing the &quot;Firing Line&quot; regimental museum and interpretation centre. The castle also serves as a venue for events, including musical performances and festivals.

==History==

===1st–4th centuries AD===


The future site of Cardiff Castle was first used by the Romans as a defensive location for many years. The first fort was probably built about AD 55 and occupied until AD 80. It was a rectangular structure much larger than the current site, and formed part of the southern Roman border in Wales during the conquest of the Silures. When the border advanced, defences became less important and the fort was replaced with a sequence of two, much smaller, fortifications on the north side of the current site.

A fourth fort was built in the middle of the 3rd century in order to combat the pirate threat along the coast, and forms the basis of the Roman remains seen on the castle site. The fort was almost square in design, approximately by large, constructed from limestone brought by sea from Penarth. The fort&#x27;s irregular shape was determined by the River Taff that flowed along the west side of the walls. The sea would have come much closer to the site than is the case in the 21st century, and the fort would have directly overlooked the harbour. This Roman fort was probably occupied at least until the end of the 4th century, but it is unclear when it was finally abandoned. There is no evidence for the re-occupation of the site until the 11th century.

===11th century===

The Normans began to make incursions into South Wales from the late 1060s onwards, pushing westwards from their bases in recently occupied England. Their advance was marked by the construction of castles, frequently on old Roman sites, and the creation of regional lordships. The reuse of Roman sites produced considerable savings in the manpower required to construct large earth fortifications.

Cardiff Castle was built during this period. There are two possible dates for the construction: William the Conqueror may have built a castle at Cardiff as early as 1081 on his return from his pilgrimage to St Davids. Alternatively, the first Norman fortification may have been constructed around 1091 by Robert Fitzhamon, the lord of Gloucester. Fitzhamon invaded the region in 1090, and used the castle as a base for the occupation of the rest of southern Glamorgan over the next few years. The site was close to the sea and could be easily supplied by ship, was well protected by the Rivers Taff and Rhymney and also controlled the old Roman road running along the coast.

Cardiff Castle was a motte-and-bailey design. The old Roman walls had collapsed and the Normans used their remains as the basis for the outer castle perimeter, digging a defensive trench and throwing up a high bank of earth over the Roman fortifications. The Normans further divided the castle with an internal wall to form an inner and an outer bailey. In the north-west corner of the castle a wooden keep was constructed on top of a tall earth motte, surrounded by a wide moat. The motte was the largest built in Wales. The overall area of the castle was around ; the inner bailey was around in area. Mills were essential to local communities during this period, and the castle mill was located outside the west side of the castle, fed by the River Taff; under local feudal law, the residents of Cardiff were required to use this mill to grind their own grain.

The conquered lands in Glamorgan were given out in packages called knights&#x27; fees, and many of these knights held their lands on condition that they provided forces to protect Cardiff Castle. Under this approach, called a castle-guard system, some knights were required to maintain buildings called &quot;houses&quot; within the castle itself, in the outer bailey. Anglo-Saxon peasants settled the region around Cardiff, bringing with them English customs, although Welsh lords continued to rule the more remote districts almost independently until the 14th century. Cardiff Castle was a Marcher Lord territory, enjoying special privileges and independence from the English Crown. The medieval town of Cardiff spread out from the south side of the castle.

===12th–14th centuries===
FitzHamon was fatally injured at the Battle of Tinchebray in 1106 and died shortly afterwards. Henry I then gave the castle in 1122 to Robert of Gloucester, the king&#x27;s illegitimate son and the husband of FitzHamon&#x27;s daughter, Mabe. After the failed attempt of Robert Curthose, duke of Normandy, William the Conqueror&#x27;s eldest son, to take England from Henry I, the duke was moved here in 1126 from imprisonment at Devizes and remained imprisoned in the castle until his death in 1134. Robert of Gloucester held the castle during the troubled years of the Anarchy in England and Wales, and passed it on to his son, William Fitz Robert. Around the middle of the century, possibly under Robert of Gloucester, a wide, high shell keep was constructed on top of the motte, along with a stone wall around the south and west sides of the inner bailey. The polygonal shell keep has architectural links to a similar design at Arundel Castle. The building work was probably undertaken in response to the threat posed following the Welsh uprising of 1136.

Tensions with the Welsh continued, and in 1158 Ifor Bach raided the castle and took William hostage for a period. A further attack followed in 1183. By 1184 town walls had been built around Cardiff, and the West Gate to the town was constructed in the gap between the castle and the river. William died in 1183, leaving three daughters. One of these, Isabel, Countess of Gloucester, was declared the sole heir to the estate by Henry II. This was contrary to legal custom in England, and was done in order that Henry could then marry her to his youngest son Prince John and thus provide him with extensive lands. John later divorced Isabel, but he retained control of the castle until she married Geoffrey de Mandeville in 1214.
Upon Isabel&#x27;s death in 1217 the castle passed through her sister to Gilbert de Clare, becoming part of the Honour of Clare, a major grouping of estates and fortifications in medieval England. The castle formed the centre of the family&#x27;s power in South Wales, although the de Clares typically preferred to reside in their castles at Clare and Tonbridge. Gilbert&#x27;s son, Richard de Clare, 6th Earl of Gloucester, carried out building work at the castle in the late 13th century, constructing the Black Tower that forms part of the southern gateway seen today. On the ground floor the tower contained the Stavell Oged and Stavell Wenn chambers, with three rooms constructed above them. Richard was also probably responsible for rebuilding the northern and eastern walls of the inner bailey in stone. The inner bailey was reached through a gatehouse on the eastern side, protected by two circular towers and later called the Exchequer Gate. The defensive work may have been prompted by the threat posed by the hostile Welsh leader Llywelyn ap Gruffudd, Prince of Wales.

Richard&#x27;s grandson, Gilbert de Clare, the last male de Clare, died at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314 and the castle was given to Hugh Despenser the Younger, the controversial favourite of Edward II. Poor harvests and harsh governance by the Despenser family encouraged a Welsh rebellion under Llywelyn Bren in 1316; this was crushed and Llywelyn was hanged, drawn and quartered in Cardiff Castle in 1318 on Hugh&#x27;s orders. The execution attracted much criticism from across both the English and Welsh communities, and in 1321 Hugh arrested Sir William Fleminge as a scapegoat for the incident, first detaining him in the Black Tower and then executing him in the castle grounds. Conflict between the Despensers and the other Marcher Lords broke out soon after, leading to the castle being sacked in 1321 during the Despenser War. The Despensers recovered the castle and retained it for the rest of the century, despite the execution of Hugh Despenser for treason in 1326. Under a 1340 charter granted by the Despensers, the castle&#x27;s constable was made the &quot;de facto&quot; mayor of Cardiff, controlling the local courts.

===15th–16th centuries===

By the 15th century, the Despensers were increasingly using Caerphilly Castle as their main residence in the region rather than Cardiff. Thomas le Despenser was executed in 1400 on charges of conspiring against Henry IV. In 1401 rebellion broke out in North Wales under the leadership of Owain Glyndŵr, quickly spreading across the rest of the country. In 1404 Cardiff and the castle were taken by the rebels, causing considerable damage to the Black Tower and the southern gatehouse in the process. On Thomas&#x27;s death the castle passed first to his young son, Richard, and on his death in 1414, through his daughter Isabel to the Beauchamp family. Isabel first married Richard de Beauchamp, the Earl of Worcester and then, on his death, to his cousin Richard de Beauchamp, the Earl of Warwick, in 1423.

Richard did not acquire Caerphilly Castle as part of the marriage settlement, so he set about redeveloping Cardiff instead. He built a new tower alongside the Black Tower in 1430, restoring the gateway, and extended the motte defences. He also constructed a substantial new domestic range in the south-west of the site between 1425 and 1439, with a central octagonal tower high, sporting defensive machicolations, and featuring four smaller polygonal turrets facing the inner bailey. The range was built of Lias ashlar stone with limestone used for some of the details, set upon the spur bases characteristic of South Wales and incorporated parts of the older 4th and 13th century walls. The buildings were influenced by similar work in the previous century at Windsor Castle and would in turn shape renovations at Newport and Nottingham Castles; the octagonal tower has architectural links to Guy&#x27;s Tower, built at around the same time in Warwick Castle. A flower garden was built to the south of the range, with private access to Richard&#x27;s chambers. Richard also rebuilt the town&#x27;s wider defences, including a new stone bridge over the River Taff guarded by the West Gate, finishing the work by 1451.
Cardiff Castle remained in the hands of Richard&#x27;s son Henry and Henry&#x27;s daughter Anne until 1449. When Anne died, it passed by marriage to Richard Neville, who held it until his death in 1471 during the period of civil strife known as the Wars of the Roses. As the conflict progressed and political fortunes rose and fell, the castle passed from George, the Duke of Clarence, to Richard, Duke of Gloucester, to Jasper Tudor, the Duke of Bedford, back to Richard Neville&#x27;s wife Anne, back to Jasper and finally to Prince Henry, the future Henry VIII. The ascension of the Tudor dynasty to the English throne at the end of the wars heralded a change in the way Wales was administered. The Tudors were Welsh in origin, and their rule eased hostilities between the Welsh and English. As a result, defensive castles became less important. In 1495 Henry VII formally revoked the Marcher territory status of Cardiff Castle and the surrounding territories, bringing them under normal English law as the County of Glamorgan.

The Crown leased the castle to Charles Somerset in 1513; Charles used it while he was living in Cardiff. In 1550 William Herbert, later the Earl of Pembroke, then bought Cardiff Castle and the surrounding estates from Edward VI. The outer bailey contained a range of buildings at this time, and extensive building work was carried out during the century. The Shire Hall had been built in the outer bailey, forming part of a walled complex of buildings that included the lodgings for the traditional twelve holders of castle-guard lands. The outer bailey also included orchards, gardens and a chapel. The castle continued to be used to detain criminals during the 16th century, with the Black Tower being used as a prison to hold them; the heretic Thomas Capper was burnt at the castle on the orders of Henry VIII. The visiting antiquarian John Leland described the keep as &quot;a great thing and strong, but now in some ruine&quot;, but the Black Tower was considered to be in good repair. In the inner bailey, the Herberts built an Elizabethan extension to the north end of the main lodgings, with large windows looking onto a new northern garden; the southern garden was replaced by a kitchen garden.

===17th–18th centuries===

In 1610 the cartographer John Speed produced a map of the castle, and noted that it was &quot;large and in good repair.&quot; In 1642, however, civil war broke out between the rival Royalist supporters of King Charles I and Parliament. Cardiff Castle was then owned by Philip Herbert, a moderate Parliamentarian, and the castle was initially held by a pro-Royalist garrison. It was taken by Parliamentary forces in the early period of the war, according to popular tradition by a sneak attack using a secret passageway. The Royalist commander William Seymour, the Marquess of Hertford, then attacked the castle in turn, taking it in a surprise assault. Parliamentary forces and local troops then immediately besieged the castle, retaking it after five hours of fighting and reinstalling a garrison. In early 1645 Mr Carne, the High Sheriff, rebelled against Parliament, taking Cardiff town but initially failing to seize the castle. The King sent forces from Oxford, under the command of Sir Charles Kemys, to reinforce Carne but Parliament despatched a naval squadron to provide support to their forces from the sea. A small battle ensued before the castle was taken by the Royalists.

With the Royalist military position across the country worsening, King Charles himself came to Cardiff Castle that July to meet with local Welsh leaders. Relations between his commander in the region, Sir Charles Gerard, and the people of Glamorgan had deteriorated badly and when Charles left the castle, he was confronted by a small army of angry locals, demanding to be given control of the castle. These clubmen then declared themselves the &quot;Peaceable Army&quot; and increased their demands to include near independence for the region. After negotiations, a compromise was found in which the royal garrison would quit the castle, to be replaced by a local Glamorgan force, commanded by Sir Richard Beaupré; in return, £800 and a force of a thousand men were promised to Charles. In September, Charles returned to South Wales and reneged on the agreement, disbanding the Peaceable Army, but his military position in the region was collapsing. The Peaceable Army&#x27;s leaders switched sides and forced the surrender of Cardiff and the castle to Parliament in mid-September.
With the outbreak of fresh fighting in 1648, a Royalist army of 8,000 fresh recruits was mustered under the command of General Rowland Laugharne and Sir Edward Stradling, with the intent of retaking Cardiff. Parliamentary forces in Brecon under the command of Colonel Thomas Horton moved quickly to reinforce the castle, although with only 3,000 men they were content to wait until a larger army under Oliver Cromwell could arrive from Gloucester. With time against them, the Royalist army attacked, leading to the battle of St Fagans just to the west of Cardiff, and a heavy Royalist defeat.

After the war, Cardiff Castle escaped the slighting, or deliberate damage and destruction, that affected many other castles. Probably because of the threat of a pro-Royalist invasion by the Presbyterian Scots, a Parliamentary garrison was installed instead and the castle remained intact. The Herberts continued to own the castle as the Earls of Pembroke, both during the interregnum and after the restoration of Charles II. The castle&#x27;s constable continued to act as mayor of the town of Cardiff, controlling the meetings of the town&#x27;s burgesses, bailiffs and aldermen; the Herberts usually appointed members of the more important local gentry to this position during the period.
Lady Charlotte Herbert was the last of the family to control Cardiff Castle. She married twice, latterly to Thomas, Viscount Windsor, and on her death in 1733 the castle passed to their son, Herbert. Herbert&#x27;s daughter, Charlotte Jane Windsor, married, in November 1766, John, Lord Mount Stuart, who rose to become the Marquess of Bute in 1794, beginning a family line that would control the castle for the next century.

In 1776, Bute began to renovate the property with the intention of turning it into a residence for his son, John. The grounds were radically altered under a programme of work that involved Capability Brown and his son-in-law, Henry Holland. The stone wall that separated the inner and outer baileys was destroyed using gunpowder, the Shire Hall and the knights&#x27; houses in the outer bailey were destroyed and the remaining ground partially flattened; the whole of the area was laid with turf. Considerable work was carried out on the main lodgings, demolishing the Herbert additions, building two new wings and removing many of the older features to produce a more contemporary, 18th-century appearance. The keep and motte was stripped of the ivy and trees that had grown up them, and a spiral path was laid down around the motte. The motte&#x27;s moat was filled in as part of the landscaping. A summer house was built in the south-east corner of the castle. Further work was planned on the property, including a reported proposal to roof the keep in copper, insert new windows and turn it into an assembly room for dances, but these projects were cut short by the death of Bute&#x27;s son in 1794.

===19th century===
In 1814 Bute&#x27;s grandson, John, inherited his title and the castle. In 1825 the new marquess began a sequence of investments in the Cardiff Docks, an expensive programme of work that would enable Cardiff to become a major coal exporting port. Although the docks were not particularly profitable, they transformed the value of the Butes&#x27; mining and land interests, making the family immensely wealthy. By 1900, the family estate owned of land in Glamorgan.

The second marquess preferred to live on the Isle of Bute in Scotland and only used Cardiff Castle occasionally. The castle saw little investment and only four full-time servants were maintained on the premises, meaning that cooked food had to be brought across from the kitchens at a nearby hotel. The castle remained at the centre of the Butes&#x27; political power base in Cardiff, however, with their faction sometimes termed &quot;the Castle party&quot;. During the violent protests of the Merthyr Rising of 1831, the marquess based himself at Cardiff Castle, from which he directed operations and kept Whitehall informed of the unfolding events. The governance of the then town of Cardiff was finally reformed by an Act of Parliament in 1835, introducing a town council and a mayor, severing the link with the castle constable.

John, 3rd Marquess of Bute, inherited the title and castle in 1848. He was then less than a year old, and as he grew up he came to despise the existing castle, believing that it represented a mediocre, half-hearted example of the Gothic style. The young Lord Bute engaged the architect William Burges to undertake the remodelling of the castle. The two shared a passion in medieval Gothic Revivalism and this, combined with Bute&#x27;s huge financial resources, enabled Burges to rebuild the property on a grand scale. Burges brought with him almost of all of the team that had supported him on earlier projects, including John Starling Chapple, William Frame and Horatio Lonsdale. Burges&#x27;s contribution, in particular his research into the history of the castle and his architectural imagination, was critical to the transformation.

Work began on Lord Bute&#x27;s coming of age in 1868 with the construction of the high Clock Tower. The tower, built in Burges&#x27;s signature Forest of Dean ashlar stone, formed a suite of bachelor&#x27;s rooms, comprising a bedroom, a servant&#x27;s room and the Summer and Winter smoking rooms. Externally, the tower was a re-working of a design Burges had previously used in an unsuccessful competition entry for the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The tower contains 7 ornate statues standing tall and carved in stone representing Mercury, Luna (moon), Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Venus and Sol (sun). The statues were created by Thomas Nicholls and he began carving them in 1869, and they were painted for the first time in 1873. Internally, the rooms were sumptuously decorated with gildings, carvings and cartoons, many allegorical in style, depicting the seasons, myths and fables. In his &quot;A History of the Gothic Revival&quot;, written as the tower was being built, Charles Locke Eastlake wrote of Burges&#x27;s &quot;peculiar talents (and) luxuriant fancy.&quot; The Summer Smoking Room rested at the top of the structure and was two storeys high with an internal balcony that, through an unbroken band of windows, gave views of the Cardiff Docks, the Bristol Channel, and the Glamorgan countryside. The floor had a map of the world in mosaic. The sculpture was also created by Thomas Nicholls.
As the rest of the castle was developed, work progressed along the rest of the 18th century range including the construction of the Guest Tower, the Arab Room, the Chaucer Room, the Nursery, the Library, the Banqueting Hall and bedrooms for both Lord and Lady Bute. In plan, the new castle followed the arrangement of a standard Victorian country house quite closely. The Bute Tower included Lord Bute&#x27;s bedroom and ended in another highlight, the Roof Garden, featuring a sculpture of the Madonna and child by Ceccardo Fucigna. Bute&#x27;s bedroom contained extensive religious iconography and an en-suite bathroom. The Octagon Tower followed, including an oratory, built on the spot where Bute&#x27;s father died, and the Chaucer Room, the roof of which is considered by historian Mark Girouard to be a &quot;superb example of Burges&#x27;s genius&quot;.

The central part of the castle comprised a two-storey banqueting hall, with the library below. Both are enormous, the latter to hold part of the bibliophile marquess&#x27;s vast library. Both included elaborate carvings and fireplaces, those in the banqueting hall depicting the castle itself in the time of Robert, Duke of Normandy. The decoration here is less impressive than elsewhere in the castle, as much of it was completed after Burges&#x27;s death by Lonsdale, a less talented painter. The Arab Room in the Herbert Tower remains however one of Burges&#x27;s masterpieces. Its jelly mould ceiling in a Moorish style is particularly notable. It was this room on which Burges was working when he died and Bute placed Burges&#x27;s initials, and his own, and the date 1881 in the fireplace as a memorial. The central portion of the castle also included the Grand Staircase, recorded in a watercolour perspective prepared by Axel Haig.

Burges&#x27;s interiors at Cardiff Castle have been widely praised. The historian Megan Aldrich considers them amongst &quot;the most magnificent that the gothic revival ever achieved&quot;, J. Mordaunt Crook has described them as &quot;three dimensional passports to fairy kingdoms and realms of gold&quot;, and John Newman praises them as &quot;most successful of all the fantasy castles of the nineteenth century.&quot; The exterior of the castle, however, has received a more mixed reception from critics. Crook admires the variegated and romantic silhouette of the building, but architect John Grant considered them to present a &quot;picturesque if not happy combination&quot; of varying historical styles, and Adrian Pettifer criticises them as &quot;incongruous&quot; and excessively Gothic in style.

Work was also carried out on the castle grounds, the interior being flattened further, destroying much of the medieval and Roman archaeological remains. In 1889, Lord Bute&#x27;s building works uncovered the remains of the old Roman fort for the first time since the 11th century, leading to archaeological investigations being carried out in 1890. New walls in a Roman style were built by William Frame on the foundations of the originals, complete with a reconstructed Roman North Gate, and the outer medieval bank was stripped away around the new walls.

The grounds were extensively planted with trees and shrubs, including over the motte. From the late 18th century until the 1850s the castle grounds were completely open to the public, but restrictions were imposed in 1858 and as a replacement the 434 acres of land to the west and north of the castle was turned into Bute Park. From 1868, the castle grounds were closed to the public altogether. Stables were built just to the north of the castle, but only half were completed during the 19th century. The Animal Wall was built along the south side of the castle, decorated with statues of animals, and the Swiss Bridge – a combination of summerhouse and river-crossing – was erected over the river by the West Gate. Cathays Park was built on the east side of the castle, but was sold to the city of Cardiff in 1898.

===20th and 21st centuries===

John, the fourth marquess, acquired the castle in 1900 on the death of his father, and the family estates and investments around the castle began to rapidly reduce in size. Cardiff had grown hugely in the previous century, its population increasing from 1,870 in 1800 to around 250,000 in 1900, but the coal trade began to diminish after 1918 and industry suffered during the depression of the 1920s. John only inherited a part of the Butes&#x27; Glamorgan estates, and in the first decades of the 20th century he sold off much of the remaining assets around Cardiff, including the coal mines, docks and railway companies, with the bulk of the land interests being finally sold off or nationalised in 1938.

Development work on the castle continued. There was extensive restoration of the medieval masonry in 1921, with architect John Grant rebuilding the South Gate and the barbican tower, and reconstructing the medieval West Gate and town wall alongside the castle, with the Swiss Bridge being moved in 1927 to make room for the new West Gate development. Further archaeological investigations were carried out into the Roman walls in 1922 and 1923, leading to Grant redesigning the northern Roman gatehouse. The second half of the castle stables were finally completed. The Animal Wall was moved in the 1920s to the west side of the castle to enclose a pre-Raphaelite themed garden. The grand staircase in the main lodgings was torn out in the 1930s. During World War II, extensive tunnels within the medieval walls were used as air-raid shelters, with eight different sections, able to hold up to 1,800 people in total, and the castle was also used to tether barrage balloons above the city.

In 1947, John, the fifth marquess, inherited the castle on the death of his father and faced considerable death duties. He sold the very last of the Bute lands in Cardiff and gave the castle and the surrounding park to the city on behalf of the people of Cardiff; the family flag was taken down from the castle as part of the official hand-over ceremony. The castle was protected as a grade I listed building and as a scheduled monument. The castle grounds are listed Grade I, jointly with Bute Park, on the Cadw/ICOMOS Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales.

Cardiff Castle is now run as a tourist attraction, and is one of the most popular sites in the city. The castle is not fully furnished, as the furniture and fittings in the castle were removed by the marquess in 1947 and subsequently disposed of; an extensive restoration has been carried out, however, of the fittings originally designed for the Clock Tower by Burges. The Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, founded in 1949, was housed in the castle&#x27;s main lodgings for many years, but moved into the castle&#x27;s former stables north of the castle in 1998. A new interpretation centre, which opened in 2008, was built alongside the South Gate at a cost of £6 million, and the castle also contains &quot;Firing Line&quot;, the joint regimental museum of the 1st The Queen&#x27;s Dragoon Guards and the Royal Welsh.

The castle has been used for a range of cultural and social events. The castle has seen various musical performances, including by Westlife, Tom Jones, A-HA, Green Day and the Stereophonics, with a capacity to accommodate over 10,000 people. During the 1960s and 1970s the castle was the setting for a sequence of military tattoos.

<doc id="113663" wikidata="Q678383" url="?curid=113663" title="Hart Memorial Trophy">
<text>The Hart Memorial Trophy, originally known as the Hart Trophy, is an annual award for the most valuable player to his team in the National Hockey League (NHL), voted by the members of the Professional Hockey Writers&#x27; Association. The original trophy was donated to the league in 1923 by David Hart, the father of Cecil Hart, the longtime head coach of the Montreal Canadiens. The Hart Trophy has been awarded 99 times to 61 different players since its beginnings in 1923–24.

==History==
The Hart Memorial Trophy is named in honour of Canadian Dr. David Hart. Dr. Hart, who donated the original trophy to the NHL, was the father of Cecil Hart, a former coach and general manager of the Montreal Canadiens. The trophy was first awarded at the conclusion of the 1923–24 NHL season to Frank Nighbor of the original Ottawa Senators. The original &quot;Hart Trophy&quot; was retired to the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1960, and the NHL began presenting a new trophy, which was dubbed the &quot;Hart Memorial Trophy&quot; in its place.

Wayne Gretzky won the award a record nine times during his career, eight consecutively. Gretzky and his Edmonton Oilers teammate Mark Messier are the only players to win the Hart Trophy with more than one team.

There have been two unanimous MVP wins; Wayne Gretzky during the 1981–1982 NHL season and Connor McDavid during the 2020–2021 NHL season. 

Players from the Montreal Canadiens have won the award seventeen times; players from the Boston Bruins and Edmonton Oilers are second with thirteen winners. Joe Thornton became the only Hart Trophy winner to have switched clubs during his winning campaign during the 2005–06 season, having played for both the Bruins and San Jose Sharks that year. The defenseman with the most trophy victories is Eddie Shore, who has four. By contrast, it is rare for a goaltender to win the award, which has happened only eight times in its history by 7 different goaltenders; Buffalo Sabres goaltender Dominik Hasek is the only two-time winner.

==Voting==
The voting is conducted at the end of the regular season by members of the Professional Hockey Writers&#x27; Association, and each individual voter ranks their top five candidates on a 10-7-5-3-1 point(s) system. Three finalists are named and the trophy is awarded at the NHL Awards ceremony after the playoffs.

The closest the voting for the Hart Trophy has ever come was in the 2001–02 season, when Jose Theodore and Jarome Iginla tied in the total voting. The tiebreaker for choosing the Hart Trophy winner in such a case is number of first-place votes: Theodore claimed it as he had 86 first-place votes to Iginla&#x27;s 82.

<doc id="113664" wikidata="Q1414964" url="?curid=113664" title="Class discrimination">
<text>Class discrimination, also known as classism, is prejudice or discrimination on the basis of social class. It includes individual attitudes, behaviors, systems of policies and practices that are set up to benefit the upper class at the expense of the lower class.
Social class refers to the grouping of individuals in a hierarchy based on wealth, income, education, occupation, and social network.

Studies show an interconnection between class discrimination and racism and sexism.

== History ==
Class structures existed in a simplified form in pre-agricultural societies, but it has evolved into a more complex and established structure following the establishment of permanent agriculture-based civilizations with a food surplus. 

Classism started to be practiced around the 18th century. Segregation into classes was accomplished through observable traits (such as race or profession) that were accorded varying statuses and privileges. Feudal classification systems might include merchant, serf, peasant, warrior, priestly, and noble classes. Rankings were far from invariant with the merchant class in Europe outranking the peasantry, while merchants were explicitly inferior to peasants during the Tokugawa Shogunate in Japan. Other prominent forms of classism include India&#x27;s caste system, where caste and class often intersected and caused discrimination against certain peoples. 

Modern classism, with less rigid class structures, is harder to identify. In a professional association posting, psychologist Thomas Fuller-Rowell states, &quot;Experiences of [class] discrimination are often subtle rather than blatant, and the exact reason for unfair treatment is often not clear to the victim.&quot;

==Intersections with other systems of oppression==
Socioeconomic, racial/ethnic, sexuality and gender inequalities in academic achievement have been widely reported in the United States, but how these three axes of inequality intersect to determine academic and non-academic outcomes among school-aged children is not well understood.

== Institutional versus personal classism ==
The term classism can refer to personal prejudice (an individual&#x27;s inclination to judge or treat others negatively based on their own rigid beliefs or emotions rather than objective evidence or critical reflection) against lower classes as well as to institutional classism (the ways in which intentional and unintentional classism is manifest in the various institutions of our society). Similarly, the term racism can refer either strictly to personal prejudice or to institutional racism. The latter has been defined as &quot;the ways in which conscious or unconscious classism is manifest in the various institutions of our society&quot;.

As with social classes, the difference in social status between people determines how they behave toward each other and the prejudices they likely hold toward each other. People of higher status do not generally mix with lower-status people and often are able to control other people&#x27;s activities by influencing laws and social standards.

The term &quot;interpersonal&quot; is sometimes used in place of &quot;personal&quot; as in &quot;institutional classism (versus) interpersonal classism&quot; and terms such as &quot;attitude&quot; or &quot;attitudinal&quot; may replace &quot;interpersonal&quot; as contrasting with institutional classism as in the Association of Magazine Media&#x27;s definition of classism as &quot;any attitude or institutional practice which subordinates people due to income, occupation, education and/or their economic condition&quot;.

Classism is also sometimes broken down into more than two categories as in &quot;personal, institutional and cultural&quot; classism. It is common knowledge in sociolinguistics that meta-social language abounds in lower registers, thus the slang for various classes or racial castes.

==Structural positions==
Schüssler Fiorenza describes interdependent &quot;stratifications of gender, race, class, religion, heterosexualism, and age&quot; as &quot;structural positions&quot; assigned at birth. She suggests that people inhabit several positions, and that positions with privilege become nodal points through which other positions are experienced. For example, in a context where gender is the primary privileged position (e.g. patriarchy, matriarchy), gender becomes the nodal point through which sexuality, race, and class are experienced. In a context where class is the primary privileged position (i.e. classism), gender and race are experienced through class dynamics. Fiorenza stresses that kyriarchy is not a hierarchical system as it does not focus on one point of domination. Instead, it is described as a &quot;complex pyramidal system&quot; with those on the bottom of the pyramid experiencing the &quot;full power of kyriarchal oppression&quot;. The kyriarchy is recognized as the status quo, and therefore, its oppressive structures may not be recognized. 

Building on this, Deborah King’s concept of &quot;multiple jeopardy&quot; provides further insight into how these oppressions interact in multiplicative rather than merely additive ways. King argues that intersecting systems of race, gender, and class discrimination do not simply add up to a triple burden but rather compound and intensify each other, creating unique conditions of subjugation. Thus, in the kyriarchal system, positions of oppression do not act independently but rather reinforce one another in specific, context-dependent ways. For instance, while Black women historically endured both racial and gendered violence, they also suffered from exploitation tied to class dynamics, with their labor and reproduction contributing directly to economic structures of enslavement. The importance of any one axis (e.g., race, class, or gender) in determining conditions for marginalized individuals varies according to context, further highlighting the nuanced and contextually bound nature of oppression.

To maintain this system, kyriarchy relies on the creation of a servant class, race, gender, or people. The position of this class is reinforced through &quot;education, socialization, and brute violence and malestream rationalization&quot;. Tēraudkalns suggests that these structures of oppression are self-sustained by internalized oppression; those with relative power tend to remain in power, while those without tend to remain disenfranchised. In addition, structures of oppression amplify and feed into each other,intensifying and altering the forms of discrimination experienced by those in different social positions.

In the UAE, Western workers and local nationals are given better treatment or are preferred, illustrating how institutional biases based on class and nationality create compounded disadvantages for other groups. This layered and compounding nature of oppression supports King’s argument that intersecting systems of discrimination operate together, reinforcing complex patterns of privilege and subjugation.

== Media representation ==
Class discrimination can be seen in many different forms of media such as television shows, films and social media. Classism is also systemic, and its implications can go unnoticed in the media that is consumed by society. Class discrimination in the media displays the knowledge of what people feel and think about classism. When seeing class discrimination in films and television shows, people are influenced and believe that is how things are in real life, for whatever class is being displayed. Children can be exposed to class discrimination through movies, with a large pool of high-grossing G-rated movies portraying classism in various contexts. Children may develop biases at a young age that shape their beliefs throughout their lifetime, which would demonstrate the issues with class discrimination being prevalent in the media. Media is a big influence on the world today, with that something such as classism is can be seen in many different lights. Media plays an important role in how certain groups of people are perceived, which can make certain biases stronger. Usually, the lower income people are displayed in the media as dirty, lacking education and manners, and homeless. People can use the media to learn more about different social classes or use the media, such as social media to influence others on what they believe. In some cases, people who are in a social class that is portrayed negatively by the media can be affected in school and social life as &quot;teenagers who grew up in poverty reported higher levels of discrimination, and the poorer the teens were, the more they experienced discrimination&quot;.

== Legislation ==
Legislative measures aim to prevent such discrimination and ensure equal opportunities for all individuals, regardless of class background. Several laws protect individuals from discrimination based on race, gender, religion, and national origin, indirectly addressing class disparities. 

Policies such as the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), is a U.S federal law that establishes labor standards for employees, primarily focusing on minimum wage, overtime pay, child labor, and recordkeeping. The FLSA was originally designed as a tool to reduce class inequality. Employers are set to pay a minimum wage, which has changed over time. With a recent increase from $5.85 to $7.25 per hours in stages. However, employees working more than 40 hours per week must receive overtime pay at 1.5 times their regular pay rate.

The Equal Pay Act of 1963 (EPA) aimed to eliminate gender-based disparities by mandating equal pay for equal work. However, the EPA did not include provisions for a living wage or broader labor protections, leaving many workers earning wages insufficient to meet basic living standards.

The European Convention on Human Rights, in Article 14, contains protections against social class (&quot;social origin&quot;) discrimination.

<doc id="113666" wikidata="Q240885" url="?curid=113666" title="Sylvie Vartan">
<text>Sylvie Vartan (; born Sylvie Georges Vartanian on 15 August 1944) is a Bulgarian-Armenian-French singer and actress. She is known as one of the most productive and tough-sounding yé-yé artists. Her performances often featured elaborate show-dance choreography, and she made many appearances on French and Italian TV.

Yearly shows with then-husband Johnny Hallyday attracted full houses at the Olympia and the Palais des congrès de Paris throughout the 1960s and mid-1970s. In 2004, after a break in performances, she began recording and giving concerts of jazz ballads in francophone countries.

==Early life==

Sylvie Vartan was born in Iskrets, Sofia Province, in the then Kingdom of Bulgaria. Her father, Georges Vartanian (1912–1970), was born in France to a Bulgarian mother named Slavka and an Armenian father. He worked as an attaché at the French embassy in Sofia. The family shortened the name Vartanian to Vartan. Her mother, Ilona (née Mayer 1914–2007), daughter of prominent architect Rudolf Mayer, was of Hungarian-Jewish descent.

When the Soviet Army invaded Bulgaria in September 1944, the Vartanian family house was nationalised and they moved to Sofia. In 1952, a friend of Sylvie&#x27;s father, film director Dako Dakovski, offered her the role of a schoolgirl in the movie &quot;Pod igoto&quot;, a film about Bulgarian rebels against the Ottoman occupation. Participating in the film made her dream of becoming an entertainer come true.

The hardships of postwar Bulgaria made the family emigrate to Paris in December 1952. At first they stayed in the Lion d&#x27;Argent hotel near Les Halles, where Georges found a job, then for the next four years they stayed in a single room at the Angleterre Hotel. Young Sylvie had to work hard to keep up at school and blend in with her schoolmates. She spent two years learning French.

In 1960, her family moved to an apartment in Michel Bizot Avenue. Thanks to the influence of her music producer brother Eddie, music became teenage Sylvie&#x27;s main interest. Her most influential genres were jazz and, out of spite toward her strict high school, rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. Her favourite artists included Brenda Lee, Bill Haley, and Elvis Presley.

==Career==
===Twisting schoolgirl===

In 1961, Eddie offered Sylvie the chance to record the song &quot;Panne d&#x27;essence&quot; with French rocker Frankie Jordan. The Decca Records EP was a surprise hit. Although she was not credited on the sleeve, &quot;Panne d&#x27;essence&quot; provided Vartan her first appearance on French television. The journalists gave her the nickname &quot;la collégienne du twist&quot;. After the &quot;twisting schoolgirl&quot; had finished the Victor Hugo High School, she was free to sign a contract with Decca Records to start recording her own EP; carrying the title song &quot;Quand le film est triste&quot;, a cover of Sue Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Sad Movies (Make Me Cry)&quot;, the EP was on sale by the beginning of December 1961.

It was another hit, that served her first concert in Paris Olympia Hall on 12 December 1961. &quot;Est-ce que tu le sais?&quot;, her version of Ray Charles&#x27; &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot;, was quickly released. She opened for Vince Taylor at Paris Olympia for her second concert. In July she toured France with Gilbert Bécaud. In autumn 1962 she released her version of &quot;The Loco-Motion&quot; on EP and her first LP, &quot;Sylvie&quot;. Her next hit was &quot;Tous mes copains&quot;, issued on EP in 1962. She also had her first adult part in a movie with the small part of a singer in the film &quot;Un clair de lune à Maubeuge&quot;. In 1963, Paul Anka offered her the song &quot;I&#x27;m Watching You&quot;, which became her first international hit in Japan and Korea. She rounded out the year with four TV specials and becoming the darling of the teen magazine &quot;Salut les Copains&quot;. Six of her 31 songs released in 1962/1963 became Top-20 European hits.

In late winter 1963, Vartan toured France with Johnny Hallyday and starred with him in the movie &quot;D&#x27;où viens-tu, Johnny?&quot;. Later, after announcing their engagement over the radio, the young couple performed to a noisy audience of 200,000 at Paris&#x27; Place de la Nation. At the year&#x27;s end they traveled to Nashville, Tennessee to record an album with The Jordanaires. With the special treatment of vocalists, strings, and brass sections in the true Nashville style, these recordings were a great commercial success in France.
The album &quot;Sylvie à Nashville&quot; included the hits &quot;La plus belle pour aller danser&quot; and &quot;Si je chante&quot; and three new songs in English (one featuring Paul Anka). Accompanied by the movie &quot;Cherchez l&#x27;idole&quot;, the EP with &quot;La plus belle pour aller danser&quot; became number one in France, sold over a million copies in Japan, was very successful in Korea and Spain, and was her first release in Italy. &quot;Il n&#x27;a rien retrouvé&quot; became another international hit that year. In January 1964, she appeared at the Paris Olympia as one of the support acts (which also included Trini Lopez) for The Beatles.

A commercial for the &quot;Renown&quot; clothing line and a supporting role in the film &quot;Patate&quot; increased her fame. She also appeared on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show, Shindig!, Hullabaloo&quot;, and an international concert tour, including Canada, South America and Polynesia. In Tokyo she gave 13 concerts in 12 days.

===Yé-yé diva===

In December 1964, as Hallyday went into military service, Sylvie&#x27;s brother Eddie hired two English songwriting session musicians, Tommy Brown on drums and Mick Jones on guitar, as they went to record in New York; they wrote her the hit &quot;Cette lettre-là&quot;. On 16 January 1964, Sylvie performed with The Beatles, and opened their show at Olympia. Set in the smart design of the &quot;J.C. Averty Show&quot;, &quot;Cette lettre-là&quot; was the first of Sylvie Vartan&#x27;s TV variety night performances. In 1966–67 she recorded more original hits. &quot;Dis moi, que tu m&#x27;aimes&quot; premiered on TV on 9 July 1967 was accompanied by a group of male dancers. &quot;Le jour qui vient&quot; was aired on the &quot;Dim Dam Dom&quot; program of the French Television 1 in color on 14 January 1968. &quot;2&#x27;35 de bonheur&quot; and &quot;Comme un garçon&quot; were other #1s in France, Italy, Belgium, Japan, or Korea.

On 11 April 1968, Vartan suffered injuries in a traffic accident but was back on tour in August. She showed off her new sexy cabaret-dancer image to the French TV audience in the &quot;Jolie poupée&quot; show on 4 December 1968; the collaboration with Maritie and Gilbert Carpentier produced a highly entertaining result. The variety night included the performance of &quot;Irrésistiblement&quot;, accompanied by elaborate girl-group choreography, and &quot;Jolie Poupée&quot;, a dialogue between a doll Sylvie and an adult one.

The hits of the &quot;Jolie poupée&quot; show were released as the &quot;Maritza&quot; album. In Italy, she released a cover version of Mina&#x27;s &quot;Zum zum zum&quot;. Being the 23rd-biggest-selling single of 1969 in Italy, Vartan&#x27;s version did better in Italian charts than Mina&#x27;s original. Vartan continued with her one-woman shows at the Paris Olympia in December 1968; they were published as the documentary &quot;Sylvie à L&#x27;Olympia&quot;.

For nine Saturday nights in winter of 1969, Vartan starred in the &quot;Doppia coppia&quot; variety nights of RAI, performing her hits &quot;Irrésistiblement&quot; (&quot;Irresistibilmente&quot;) and &quot;Le jour qui vient&quot; (&quot;Una cicala canta&quot;) in Italian. In March 1969, &quot;Irresistibilmente&quot; entered the Italian charts at No. 3, peaked at No. 2 and stayed in Top Ten for 10 weeks. In 1969 the single was the No. 22 single on the Italian chart. The tender ballad &quot;Blam blam blam&quot;, written especially for &quot;Doppia coppia&quot;, peaked at No. 14 on the Italian charts and was among the 100 biggest-selling singles in Italy in 1969.

After her world tour in autumn 1969, she returned to Italy to perform &quot;Festa negli occhi, festa nel cuore&quot; on a &quot;Canzonissima&quot; variety night and &quot;C&#x27;est un jour à rester couché&quot; on the &quot;Incontro con Sylvie Vartan&quot; TV show, recorded in the Gattopardo Club of Messina. Her appearances were popular in Italy and France; she donned a different costume for each song, including plenty of short skirts and Barbarella boots. The cartoonists of both countries even drew Sylvie Vartan lookalikes.

===1970–present===

Despite suffering a second serious car accident in 1970, Sylvie Vartan continued to perform and record extensively; and in 1972 she starred in the film &quot;Malpertuis&quot;. She sold millions of records on the RCA label, which made her its most prolific artist after Elvis Presley. Her most famous songs are &quot;J&#x27;ai un probleme&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;amour au Diapason&quot; (73), &quot;Parle moi de ta vie&quot;(71), &quot;Petit rainbow&quot; (77), &quot;Bye Bye Leroy Brown&quot; (74), &quot;Disco Queen&quot; and &quot;Nicolas&quot; (79), and &quot;Caro Mozart&quot;, an international hit in Italian (72). However, her annual world tours and Italian TV shows continued to include her biggest late-1960s hits.

In 1976 she recorded &quot;Qu&#x27;est-ce qui fait pleurer les blondes?&quot;, a disco-style cover of a John Kongos track, which topped the French chart for several weeks. Her disco era climaxed at the &quot;Dancing star&quot; TV show on TF1, produced by Maritie and Gilbert Carpentier, on 10 September 1977. RCA published the show as the &quot;Dancing star&quot; After a week of concerts in Las Vegas in 1982, she released a duet with John Denver: &quot;Love Again&quot;, a #85 single on &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 followed in 1985 by a new album in the US with &quot;Double Exposure&quot; and &quot;One-Shot Lover&quot;. In 1986 she took a break from show business; she returned in 1989 with &quot;C&#x27;est Fatal&quot; (&quot;E&#x27; Fatale&quot; in Italy).

In 1990, Vartan gave a concert at Sofia&#x27;s Palace of Culture, opening and closing with a Bulgarian song. This was her first visit to the city since her emigration.

In 1991, she performed for three weeks at the Palais des Sports in Paris and hit the charts with &quot;Quand tu es là&quot;. In 1995, she starred in &quot;L&#x27;ange noir&quot; directed by Jean-Claude Brisseau. In 1996 Sylvie recorded a successful album (&quot;Toutes les femmes ont un secret&quot;) featuring &quot;Je n&#x27;aime encore que toi&quot; written by Quebecer Luc Plamondon. After her brother Eddie died in 2001, she took another break from performing in public. In fall 2004 Vartan started recording and giving concerts of jazz ballads in francophone countries and Japan. She performed two weeks in the Palais des congrès in 2004 and 2008—all sold-out concerts. In 2009 she toured Turkey, France, Japan, Switzerland, Quebec, USA, Italy, Spain, Netherlands and Belgium.

==Legacy==
In 2005, the singer was appointed as WHO Goodwill Ambassador for Maternal and Child Health in the European Region. Vartan is regarded as a gay icon.

==Honours==
* &quot;Chevalier&quot; (Knight) of the Ordre national du Mérite on 13 November 1987, &quot;Officier&quot; (Officer) in 2006.
* &quot;Chevalier&quot; (Knight) of the Legion of Honour on 14 November 1998, &quot;Officier&quot; (Officer) in 2009.

==Personal life==

In 1962, during her second concert in Paris Olympia Hall, Vartan met pop-rock singer Johnny Hallyday; they were married in Offenburg on 12 April 1965. They had a son, David Michael Benjamin Smet, later known as David Hallyday. Sylvie Vartan and Johnny Hallyday were their generation&#x27;s &quot;golden couple&quot; in France, and their marriage was among the most carefully watched relationships for the nation&#x27;s publicity. But Hallyday openly preferred his pals to parenting, sparking many disagreements, and the couple finally divorced on 4 November 1980. Vartan later married record producer Tony Scotti, and they have adopted a young Bulgarian girl, Darina.

Vartan is the aunt of actor Michael Vartan, the son of her older brother Eddie Vartan.

<text>Shah Alam (, from Persian meaning &quot;king of the world&quot;) is a city and the state capital of Selangor, Malaysia which is situated within the Petaling District and a small portion of the neighbouring Klang District. Shah Alam replaced Kuala Lumpur as the capital city of the state of Selangor in 1978 due to Kuala Lumpur&#x27;s incorporation into a Federal Territory in 1974. Shah Alam was the first planned city in Malaysia after independence from Britain in 1957.

==History==

Malaysia grew rapidly after its independence in 1957 under its second Prime Minister of Malaysia, Allahyarham Tun Abdul Razak Hussein. Shah Alam was once known as Sungai Renggam and was noted for its rubber and oil palm estates. Later, the same area was identified as Batu Tiga prior to Malaysian independence, and has been a centre of rubber and palm oil trade for centuries.

Its current name was chosen by the then state Sultan of Selangor, Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah, after his late father Sultan Alam Shah. Many other monuments, buildings and even a street are named after the late Sultan. Shah Alam was opened in 1963 with the purpose of making it the new administrative centre of Selangor, replacing Kuala Lumpur which was made a Federal Territory on 1 February 1974. With the consent of the Sultan, Shah Alam was proclaimed the capital of Selangor on 7 December 1978 with an initial area of 41.68 km2, and administered by a municipal council.

<text>Vox is a British musical equipment manufacturer founded in 1957 by Thomas Walter Jennings in Dartford, Kent, England. The company is most famous for making the Vox AC30 guitar amplifier, used by The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Kinks, The Yardbirds, Queen, Dire Straits, U2, and Radiohead; the Vox Continental electric organ, the Vox wah-wah pedal used by Jimi Hendrix, and a series of innovative electric guitars and bass guitars. Since 1992, Vox has been owned by the Japanese electronics firm Korg.

==History==

=== Beginnings ===
The Jennings Organ Company was founded by Thomas Walter Jennings in Dartford Kent, England after World War II. Jennings&#x27;s first successful product was the Univox, an early self-powered electronic keyboard similar to the Clavioline.

In 1956, Jennings was shown a prototype guitar amplifier made by Dick Denney, a big band guitarist and workmate from World War II. The company was renamed Jennings Musical Industries, or JMI. In 1958 the 15-watt Vox AC15 amplifier was launched; &quot;vox&quot; simply being the Latin word for &quot;voice&quot;. It was popularised by The Shadows and other British rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll musicians and became a commercial success.

Vox released the 12-watt AC10 in late 1959 as a student model, originally as a 1x10-inch combo and later as a 2x10-inch combo. Features simplified from the AC15 included a tremolo effect (mislabeled as &quot;vibrato&quot;), a single, shared Tone control, and smaller output transformer. The AC10 was discontinued in 1965.

=== The AC30 ===
In 1959, with sales under pressure from the more powerful Fender Twin, by request from The Shadows, who requested amplifiers with more power, Vox produced what was essentially a double-powered AC15 and named it the AC30. The AC30, fitted with alnico magnet-equipped Celestion &quot;blue&quot; loudspeakers and later Vox&#x27;s special &quot;Top Boost&quot; circuitry, and like the AC15 using valves (known in the US as vacuum tubes), helped to produce the sound of the British Invasion, being used by The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Kinks and the Yardbirds, among others. AC30s were later used by Brian May of Queen (who is known for having a wall of AC30s on stage), Paul Weller of The Jam (who also assembled a wall of AC30s), Rory Gallagher, The Edge of U2 and Radiohead guitarists Thom Yorke, Jonny Greenwood and Ed O&#x27;Brien. The Vox AC30 has been used by many other artists including Mark Knopfler, Hank Marvin who was instrumental in getting the AC30 made, Ritchie Blackmore, John Scofield, Snowy White, Will Sergeant, Tom Petty, The Echoes, Mike Campbell, Peter Buck, Justin Hayward, Tom DeLonge, Mike Nesmith, Peter Tork, Noel Gallagher, Matthew Bellamy, Omar Rodriguez-Lopez, Dustin Kensrue, Tame Impala, Jimmy Page, Tony Iommi and many others.

===Other amplifiers===

Once The Beatles became tied to Vox amplifiers (a deal was struck early in their recording career whereby they would be provided Vox equipment for exclusive stage use), the quest for more power began. John Lennon&#x27;s first Vox was a fawn-coloured twin-speaker AC15, while George Harrison&#x27;s was a fawn AC30 with a top boost unit installed in the rear panel. They were later provided with twin black-covered AC30s with the rear panel top boost units. Paul McCartney was provided with one of the first transistorised amplifiers, the infamous T60, which featured an unusual separate cabinet outfitted with a 12&quot; and a 15&quot; speaker. The T60 head had a tendency to overheat, and McCartney&#x27;s was no exception, so he was then provided with an AC30 head which powered the T60&#x27;s separate speaker cabinet.

As the crowds at Beatles shows got louder, they needed louder amps. Jennings provided Lennon and Harrison with the first AC50 piggyback units, and McCartney&#x27;s AC30/T60 rig was replaced with an AC100 head and an AC100 2×15&quot; cabinet. Lennon and Harrison eventually got their own AC100 rigs, with 4×12&quot;/2-horn configurations. In 1966 and 1967, The Beatles had several prototype or specially-built Vox amplifiers, including hybrid tube/solid-state units from the short-lived 4- and 7-series. Harrison in particular became fond of the 730 amp and 2×12 cabinet, using them to create many of the guitar sounds found on &quot;Revolver&quot; and &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. Lennon favoured the larger 7120 amplifier, while Harrison preferred the 730 and McCartney had its sister 430 bass amplifier.
In the early 1960s, the Brothers Grim became the first American group to use Vox Amplifiers. Joe Benaron, CEO of Warwick Electronics Inc. / Thomas Organ Company, the United States distributor of Vox, along with Bernard Stockly (London), importer of Challenge pianos to the United States, arranged for the boys to have full use of the tall Super AC 100 Vox amps (4×12&quot; speakers). The solid-state version of this amp (known in the US as the &quot;Super Beatle&quot;) was produced to cash in on the Beatles-Vox affiliation, but was not nearly as successful as the valve AC30 and AC15 models.

A modern popular rock artist known for use of the Super Beatle is Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, although in the April 2008 issue of Premier Guitar, lead guitarist Mike Campbell revealed that the Super Beatle backline was, on their thirtieth anniversary tour at least, primarily used only as a stage prop, though Petty used his &quot;on a couple of songs.&quot; In the group&#x27;s early days, the Vox equipment was chosen because it was relatively inexpensive in 1976, yet had a handsome appearance. A photograph included in the article showed Campbell&#x27;s guitar sound was coming from other amplifiers hidden behind the large Super Beatles, which Campbell stated were &quot;a tweed Fender Deluxe and a blackface Fender Princeton together behind the Super Beatle, and an isolated Vox AC30 that I have backstage in a box.&quot;

The Monkees concealed themselves in large empty Vox cabinet and emerged from them as a grand entrance to the opening of the shows on the 1967 tour and they used real Vox amps for the performances.

=== Instruments ===

==== Guitars ====

Vox&#x27;s first electric guitars, the &quot;Apache&quot;, &quot;Stroller&quot; and &quot;Clubman&quot; were modeled after solid-body, bolt-neck Fenders, which at the time were not available in the UK. A four-string &quot;Clubman Bass&quot; followed shortly after. These first guitars were low-priced, had unusual TV connector output jacks and were produced by a cabinet maker in Shoeburyness, Essex. Vox president Tom Jennings commissioned &quot;London Design Centre&quot; to create a unique new electric guitar, and in 1962 Vox introduced the pentagonal &quot;Phantom&quot;, originally made in England but soon after made by EKO of Italy. The first Phantom guitars were given to The Echoes to trial in 1962 and were used by them until 1970. They can be heard on many of their recordings and records they did with other artists such as Dusty Springfield. Aside from the unusual body and headstock shapes, Phantoms featured copies of the Fender Stratocaster neck and its attachment, the &quot;Strat&quot;&#x27;s three single-coil pick-ups and standard vibrato bridge that in this case copied a Bigsby unit. Aside from being a bit awkward to hold for seated playing, the Phantom guitars now approached professional quality, performance and price. Phil &quot;Fang&quot; Volk of &quot;Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders&quot; played a &quot;Phantom IV&quot; bass (which was eventually retrofitted with a Fender neck). It was followed a year later by the teardrop-shaped &quot;Mark VI&quot;, the prototype of which had only two pick-ups (rather than three) and was made specifically for Brian Jones of &quot;The Rolling Stones&quot;, again using a Bigsby-like &quot;Hank Marvin&quot; bridge. By the end of the decade, Stones bassist Bill Wyman was shown in Vox advertisements playing a teardrop hollow-bodied bass made for him by the company, subsequently marketed as the &quot;Wyman Bass&quot;. Many guitar gear authorities dispute that he ever actually used the instrument for recording or live performance. (See also Vox Bass Guitar.)

Vox experimented with several built-in effects and electronics on guitars such as the &quot;Cheetah&quot;, &quot;Ultrasonic&quot;, and &quot;Invader&quot;. Ian Curtis of &quot;Joy Division&quot; is known to have owned two white Vox &quot;Phantom VI Special&quot; effects guitars which had push button switches on the scratch plate to activate the effects circuits.
Another innovation was the Guitar Organ, which featured miniaturised VOX organ circuitry activated by the contact of the strings on the frets, producing organ tones in key with guitar notes in one of three ways. A switch on the instrument allow choosing between guitar only, organ only (holding down strings produced an organ tone without the string needing to be played in a traditional sense as mentioned) and a combination of both. This instrument was heavy and cumbersome with a steel neck and external circuit boxes. The initial production run proved unreliable due to the fact that JMI production engineers, eager to put the instrument into production, had used Denney&#x27;s prototype as a template for wiring the instrument in Denney&#x27;s absence. As a consequence, the instrument gained a negative reputation, but was a hallmark of the ingenuity of the company.

In the mid-1960s, as the sound of electric 12-string guitars became popular, Vox introduced the &quot;Phantom XII&quot;, which was subsequently used by Tony Hicks of The Hollies, Captain Sensible of early English punk band The Damned and Greg Kihn; the &quot;Mark XII&quot; electric 12-string guitar and the &quot;Tempest XII&quot;, also made in Italy, which featured a more conventional body style. The &quot;Phantom XII&quot; and &quot;Mark XII&quot; both featured a unique Bigsby style 12-string vibrato tailpiece, which made them, along with Semie Moseley&#x27;s &quot;Ventures&quot; model 12-string Mosrite, the only 12-string electric guitars to feature such a vibrato. The &quot;Stereo Phantom XII&quot; had split pick-ups resembling the Fender &quot;Precision&quot; bass, each half of which could be sent to a separate amplifier using an onboard mix control.
Vox produced a number of other models of 6 and 12 string electric guitars in both England and Italy.

Guitar pedals and other effects, including an early version of the wah-wah pedal used by Jimi Hendrix and the &quot;Tone Bender&quot; fuzzbox pedal, a Vox variation on the famous original Gary Hurst Tone Bender (used by Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin and Jeff Beck of the Yardbirds as well as The Beatles, Spencer Davis and others), were also marketed by Vox and later on manufactured in Italy.

In 1967, Vox introduced a series of guitars which featured built in effects such as Distortion (fuzz tone), Repeat Percussion (percussive tremolo), Treble/Bass Booster and a wah-wah operated by the heel of the picking hand pushing on a spring-loaded lever over the bridge. The &quot;Delta&quot; phantom style guitar and bass, the &quot;Starstream&quot; teardrop 6-string, and &quot;Constellation&quot; teardrop bass had such effects.

Vox also pioneered the first radio microphone system, which freed singers from having their microphone connected to their amplifier or PA by a cable.

Vox had experimented with Japanese manufacturers at the end of the sixties with the Les Paul-style &quot;VG2&quot;, and in 1982 all guitar production was moved to Japan, where the Standard &amp; Custom 24 &amp; 25 guitars and basses were built by Matsumoku, the makers of Aria guitars. These were generally regarded as the best quality guitars ever built under the Vox name. They were discontinued in 1985 when production was moved to Korea and they were replaced by the &quot;White Shadow&quot; models. A number of &quot;White Shadow&quot; &quot;M&quot;-series guitars and basses are clearly marked as &quot;made in Japan&quot;, suggesting a phased production hand-over.

In 1998, Vox Amplification Ltd Korg reissued many of their classic Phantom and Teardrop guitars.

In March 2008, Vox unveiled the semi-hollow &quot;Virage DC&quot; (double cutaway) and &quot;SC&quot; (single cutaway) at the NAMM Show. Notable characteristics include a 3D contoured ergonomic design which not only had an arch top, but also bent back from the neck toward the base of the guitar hugging the player&#x27;s body. The guitar body was milled from a single block of wood and had a fitted face in combinations of mahogany and ash. A new triple coil pick-up system designed by DiMarzio, called the &quot;Three-90&quot;, emulates a humbucker, P-90, or single-coil tone.

In 2009, Vox refined the Virage design with the &quot;Virage II&quot; series of guitars. This series repeated the double and single cutaway bodies of the earlier Virage series, but also included the &quot;Series 77&quot; (with double horns emulating the Gibson SG series), the &quot;Series 55&quot; (with resemblance to the Gibson Les Paul single cutaway), and the &quot;Series 33&quot; (with lower cost fabrication than the 77 and 55 series). The Virage II series featured &quot;CoAxe&quot; pick-ups which resembled the earlier &quot;Three-90&quot; in functionality, but were claimed to be less noisy. The one-piece cast &quot;MaxConnect&quot; bridge of this series is aluminium and provides both a saddle and anchor for the strings.

For 2012, the VOX Phantom and Teardrop guitars appeared again as the APACHE Series travel guitars with a host of built in features including a 2-channel guitar amplifier, speakers, dozens of rhythm patterns, even a convenient E-String tuner.

In May 2013, a Vox guitar used by George Harrison and John Lennon on the &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot; album sold at a New York auction for 408,000 USD.

In the later years of Prince&#x27;s life, he primarily utilized several versions of the Vox HDC-77 guitar, after being introduced to it by 3rdeyegirl member Ida Kristine Nielsen in the year of 2012. Some of the guitars the artist used included a Blackburst version, a White Ivory version, and a multicolored version.

==== Organs ====

The Vox brand was also applied to Jennings&#x27; electronic organs, particularly the Vox Continental of 1962, which featured drawbars and used transistors to generate sound. John Lennon played one onstage with The Beatles during &quot;I&#x27;m Down&quot;, including at their 1965 concert at Shea Stadium, and the instrument was used by British Invasion musicians such as the Dave Clark Five&#x27;s Mike Smith and the Animals&#x27; Alan Price. American Vox players include Paul Revere with Paul Revere &amp; the Raiders and The Doors&#x27; Ray Manzarek, who used a Continental on the group&#x27;s first two albums before switching to a Gibson G-101. Doug Ingle&#x27;s Iron Butterfly used it on songs such as &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida&quot;. The Continental can also be heard on the Monkees&#x27; hit &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot; and Van Morrison&#x27;s &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot;.

More recently, organist Spider Webb can be seen using a Vox Continental with the UK garage band The Horrors. Benmont Tench of Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers has frequently used a Continental throughout his career.
The Continental and other Vox organs such as the Jaguar, the Continental II, Super Continental, and the Continental 300 share characteristic visual features including orange and black vinyl coverings, stands made of chromed steel tubing, and reversed black and white keys. Jennings formed a deal with the Thomas Organ Company in 1966 to manufacture Continentals in the US, with production moving to Italy the following year. The Italian Vox Continentals featured plastic keys instead of the original wooden ones, which were less reliable and broke more easily.

==== GuitarOrgan ====
In 1966, Vox introduced the Guitar Organ, a Phantom VI guitar with internal organ electronics. John Lennon was given one in a bid to secure an endorsement, although he did not record with it.

The V251 connects to a mains power-supply unit via DIN plugs and a four-conductor cable (power, guitar output, organ output and common). The PSU in turn has individual amplifier outputs for guitar and organ.

Organ tones are sounded in one of three ways; in &#x27;normal&#x27; mode, by pressing any string onto a fret; in &#x27;percussion&#x27; mode, by fretting any string and touching the included brass plectrum (connected to a short wire plugged into a socket on the scratchplate) onto any metal part of the guitar; or by pressing one of the six &#x27;open string&#x27; buttons. There is an option to silence the lowest two strings, and the organ section, as a whole, can also be switched off. There is a four-position octave selector, a six-position effect selector, a four-way selector for the percussion and a flute selector.

The guitar section is equipped with two Vox pick-ups, a three-way selector, and conventional volume and tone controls. In common with Phantom models, it has a Bigsby-style tremolo unit, a fixed-intonation bridge and individual Vox-branded tuners.

The V251 is somewhat awkward to play as the neck is wider at the nut end than at the body, and a player&#x27;s natural tendency to bend a string results in it slipping off the divided fret. Additionally it is very heavy, weighing, nearly 9 lbs.

The instrument never became popular though it was a precursor to the modern guitar synthesizer. Ian Curtis of Joy Division is sometimes believed to have used a GuitarOrgan, but he actually owned two white Phantom VI special with onboard effects.

=== Expansion, transistors, and decline ===
The Vox brand grew quickly in the early 1960s, expanding along with its roster of endorsing musicians. As tube-based amps such as the AC100 were engineered with more power, they developed a reputation for overheating and malfunction. The onset of transistors pushed Vox and other manufacturers to develop solid-state amplifiers as a solution.

In 1964, Tom Jennings developed a relationship with Sepulveda, California-based Thomas Organ Company, which began importing English Vox product lines to the United States. A shift in focus to transistors came with Jennings&#x27; decision to sell controlling interest in JMI to the Royston Group, a British holding company, and move some manufacturing to Erith, Kent. The Traveller, Virtuoso, Conqueror, Defiant, Supreme, Dynamic Bass, Foundation Bass and Super Foundation Bass lines were developed and introduced during this period. Jennings remained as chief executive officer until 1969.

With assistance from Dick Denney, Thomas Organ began to produce a line of mostly solid-state amplifiers in the United States that carried the Vox brand and cosmetic stylings. First marketed in 1965, these amps effectively paralleled JMI&#x27;s own transistor-based amplifiers, but differed from British and Italian made Vox in sound and reliability. To promote their line, Thomas Organ published a magazine called &#x27;Vox Music Scene,&#x27; and built the Voxmobile, a Ford roadster dressed up to look like a Phantom guitar - complete with a Continental organ and several &quot;Beatle&quot; amplifiers. Despite the marketing effort, the Vox brand shed endorsees, and sales waned.

Tom Jennings set up a new company in his old Dartford location, joined later by Denney. Jennings Electronic Industries operated for several years, making an updated and rebadged version of the AC30 along with other amplifiers, as well as a new range of organs.

Royston, due to the loss of a lucrative government contract in one of its other companies, filed for bankruptcy in 1968. As a result, the Vox brand passed through a series of owners during the 1970s including a British bank and Dallas Arbiter. The AC30 continued to be built alongside newer solid-state amps, but with a series of cost-cutting measures such as loudspeakers with ceramic magnets, printed circuit boards, solid-state rectification, and particleboard cabinet construction. An all-solid-state version of the AC30 was also introduced alongside the classic, tube-powered model.

Rose Morris bought Vox in 1978 before its distribution deal with Marshall ended. The company attempted to reinvigorate the Vox brand, continuing to build the AC30 along with several new and modern amplifiers.

Korg acquired a majority stake in Rose Morris in 1992, including the Vox product lines. Korg dissolved much of the prior business before renewing the Vox brand based on its traditional strengths.

==Renewal and current products==
Korg revived the tube rectifier and alnico speakers for their version of the AC30 in what was considered the most faithful version of the amp produced for many years. In 2005, manufacturing was moved to Vietnam, including a yet-newer redesign of the venerable AC30, designated the AC30CC, since superseded by the AC30C2. A hand-wired, heritage version, the AC30H2 (and the wooden cased AC30H2L) were also produced. The AC30CC and AC15CC were later replaced with the AC30C2 and AC15C1 which had solid state rectification and a revised chassis. In 2010, Vox released a Hand-Wired version of the AC30 and AC15 with turret board construction, valve rectification and a choice of Celestion Greenback or Alnico Blue speakers.

In 2011, a hand-wired version of the AC4 was also released.

The AC10 was re-introduced in 2015 as model AC10C1.

=== Night Train ===
Vox entered the &quot;lunchbox&quot; amp market in 2009 when it introduced the Night Train (NT15H) head. This compact, all valve amp is a 15W head with two 12AX7 preamp tubes, a pair of push-pull EL-84 valves in its power section, and a solid state rectifier. It used a cathodyne splitter, and its power section is cathode biased. The amp is solidly constructed on a black steel chassis with a bright mirror chrome finish, diamond-perforated steel tube cage, giving it a physical appearance reminiscent of a lunchbox (some comparisons to a toaster have been made as well). The NT15H also set the cosmetic and operational template for two additional releases, also all valve heads, that book-ended its output power: the 2W Lil Night Train (NT2H) in 2010, which uses two 12AX7 preamp tubes and a 12AU7 dual triode as its power section, and the 50W Night Train 50 (NT50H) in 2011, a two channel head with four 12AX7 preamp tubes and a pair of EL-34 valves in its power section. All models feature the ability to choose between the familiar &quot;chimey&quot; Vox voice and a high gain voice that bypasses the EQ section, via the Bright/Thick switch. Note though that each Night Train model&#x27;s feature set also provides some unique capability apart from its siblings. For example, the NT15H output power can be switched between 15W pentode and 7.5W triode modes. The NT2H provides a headphone/line out jack with on-board speaker emulation (for practice or direct recording use). Lastly, the NT50H offers two channels by adding a second, optionally foot-switchable, higher gain &quot;Girth&quot; channel, a &quot;Tone Cut&quot; control and a &quot;Tight&quot; switch in its master section, plus a bypassable, JFET-driven effects loop. All models were designed for use with most any 8 ohm or 16 ohm cabinet, although Vox also offers a matching cabinet (NT15H/V112NT, NT2H/V110NT, NT50H/V212NT) for each model.

In 2013, Vox released updated &quot;G2&quot; versions of the 15 watt and 50 watt heads, and added a combo version of the NT15H-G2 called the NT15C1. Compared to the original NT15H, the NT15H-G2 adds a foot-switchable Girth channel (which first appeared on the original NT50H) with an additional 12AX7 in the preamp section, a &quot;Dark&quot; switch, a digital reverb, and an effects loop. However, Vox did not retain the pentode/triode output section modes from the &quot;G1&quot; version that allowed for full or half power operation as well as a broader tonal palette. The NT50H-G2 differs from the original NT50H with the additions of an XLR D.I. out and a digital reverb, and the deletions of one 12AX7 preamp tube and the &quot;Tight&quot; switch. It also appears the FX loop is no longer bypassable. Gone is the bright chrome look of the &quot;G1&quot; models as both heads received new cosmetics in the form of a black mirror finish on the tube cage and a new suitcase-type handle. Vox also released &quot;G2&quot; versions of their matching cabs: the V112NT-G2 (one Celestion G12M Greenback speaker), and the V212NT-G2 (two Celestion G12H 70th anniversary model speakers), each also sporting the suitcase-type handle. The new NT15C1 combo combines an NT15H-G2 chassis with a single 16Ω 12&quot; Celestion G12M Greenback speaker in a black tolex cabinet with a suitcase-type handle.

In August 2014, Vox released two Night Train limited editions, both of which were cosmetic updates to the NT2H set and the NT15C1 combo respectively, that recall a more traditional Vox aesthetic. For the Lil&#x27; Night Train NT2H-GD-SET, Vox supplied the NT2H head with a matte gold coloured tube cage and black control knobs, and then covered its V110NT cab with a retro-traditional &quot;Brown Diamond&quot; grille cloth and basket weave covering (since there was no &quot;G2&quot; version of the Lil Night Train, this limited edition NT2H seems to mark the end of the line for this model as Vox makes no further reference to it). For the NT15C1-CL (Classic) combo amp Vox applied a similar treatment with the installation of a gold logo badge and trim on the front of the NT15C1 combo as well as adding the &quot;Brown Diamond&quot; grille cloth.

The Night Train series was discontinued in 2017.

=== Digital modelling amplifiers ===
Korg introduced the Vox line of digital modelling amplifiers in 2001. Utilizing Korg&#x27;s REMS modelling software, the blue-colored Valvetronix amps were driven via the &quot;Valve Reactor&quot; low-power tube preamp stage and a solid-state power amp, emulating 11 classic amplifier sounds with a variety of built-in effects (Notably, Korg did not specifically cite in the product manual which non-Vox amplifiers were modelled.):

* Boutique CL
* Black 2×12 (based on 1965 Fender Twin Reverb)
* Tweed 4×10 (based on 1959 Fender Bassman)
* AC15 (original Vox amp)
* AC30TB (original Vox amp)
* UK &#x27;70s (based on Marshall 1959 Super Lead)
* UK &#x27;80s (based on Marshall JCM 800)
* UK Modern
* US NuMetal (based on Mesa/Boogie Dual Rectifier)
* US HiGain
* US TweakGain
* Boutique O.D
The Valvetronix XL series (2007-2009) built on the concept, focused on high gain sounds designed to span the entire range of heavy rock music. With four variations, the Valvetronix XL renamed its control labels with rock-inspired descriptors:
* &quot;Glass / Funked / Buzzsaw / Crunched / Thrashed / Raged / Modern / Fluid / Molten / Black / Damaged&quot;
The entire line was refreshed in 2008 with the chrome-tinged Valvetronix VT series, including three programmable memory banks and 22 total amplifier models (in order from green to red mode):

* Boutique CL / Modded CL: Dumble Overdrive (Clean)/Fender Showman (Dumble Modded)
* Deluxe Tweed / Tweed 2X12: Fender Tweed Deluxe/Fender &#x27;57 Twin Amp
* Super 4X10 / Tweed 4X10: Fender Super Reverb/Fender Tweed Bassman
* AC15 TB / AC15: Vox AC15 (1960s Top Boost)/VOX AC15 (1950s EF86)
* AC30HH / AC30TB: Vox AC30HH / VOX AC30 Top Boost
* Express Train / Boutique OD: Trainwreck Express/Dumble Overdrive (Overdrive)
* AC50CP2 / AC30BM: Vox AC50CP2/Vox AC30BM Brian May
* UK 25TH / UK &#x27;80S: Marshall 2555 Slash Jubilee / Marshall JCM800
* US &#x27;90S / Cali Metal: Peavey 6505 / Mesa Boogie Dual Rectifier
* UK Modern / UK &#x27;90S: Marshall JVM / Marshall JCM2000
* Boutique Metal / Metal Bull: Diezel VH4 / VHT Pittbull
Korg/Vox evolved the Valvetronix line from 2010 to 2019, pushed the emulation capacity to 33 different models in the VT+ Series, added a premium VTX 150 variant with professional-grade features, and revised the modeling engine called Virtual Element Technology (VET) engineered to more accurately represent classic sounds. Vox mobile and desktop software were introduced with the 2015 VT20X and VT40X, offering players the ability to further customize sounds.

Vox modelling technology was condensed into the Vox Mini3 (sans the tube preamp) in 2010, a compact, battery-powered, portable amp with separate mic input and controls for busking.

The MV50 series of compact, hybrid amplifier heads released in 2015 were first to feature the Nutube 6P1, a long-life, dual-triode vacuum tube developed by Korg and Noritake Itron Corp. Each variant in the MV50 series emulated an individual style of classic amplifier, including Clean, AC, Rock, Boutique, and High Gain, with basic controls for Gain, Tone, and Volume.

Vox applied the Nutube hybrid approach to the lunchbox-sized VX50GTV in 2019, and the 50-watt, Celestion-backed Cambridge50 in 2020, each modelling 11 revised amplifier models:

=== Cooltron ===

Vox developed a line of analog effects pedals dubbed Cooltron, designed to offer guitarists vintage-sounding overdrive, compression, boost, distortion and tremolo. The pedals used low-power 12AU7 tubes to create vintage soft-clipping preamplification. Two of the Cooltron pedals, the Big Ben Overdrive and the Bulldog Distortion, won the &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine Platinum Award.
Cooltron pedals:

* Bulldog Distortion
* Brit Boost
* Big Ben Overdrive
* Duel Overdrive
* Over the Top Boost
* Snake Charmer Compressor
* VibraVOX

<text>Pitcher plants are carnivorous plants 
known as pitfall traps—a prey-trapping mechanism featuring a deep cavity filled with digestive liquid. The traps of pitcher plant are considered to be &quot;true&quot; pitcher plants and are formed by specialized leaves. The plants attract and drown the prey with nectar.

== Types ==
The term &quot;pitcher plant&quot; generally refers to members of the Nepenthaceae and Sarraceniaceae families, but similar pitfall traps are employed by the monotypic Cephalotaceae and some members of the Bromeliaceae. The families Nepenthaceae and Sarraceniaceae are the most species-rich families of pitcher plants.

=== Nepenthaceae ===
The Nepenthaceae contains a single genus, &quot;Nepenthes&quot;, containing over 100 species and numerous hybrids and cultivars. In this genus of Old World pitcher plants, the pitchers are borne at the end of tendrils that extend from the midrib of an otherwise unexceptional leaf. Old World pitcher plants are typically characterized as having reduced and symmetrical pitchers with a comprehensive waxy coating on the surface of the inner pitcher wall. The plants themselves are often climbers, accessing the canopy of their habitats using the aforementioned tendrils, although others are found on the ground in forest clearings, or as epiphytes on trees.
=== Sarraceniaceae ===

The New World pitcher plants (Sarraceniaceae), which comprise three genera, are ground-dwelling herbs whose pitchers arise from a horizontal rhizome. In this family, the entire leaf forms the pitcher, as opposed to Nepenthaceae, where the pitcher arises from the terminal portion of the leaf. The species of the genus &quot;Heliamphora&quot;, which are popularly known as marsh pitchers (or erroneously as sun pitchers), have a simple rolled-leaf pitcher, at the tip of which is a spoon-like structure that secretes nectar. They are restricted to areas of high rainfall in South America. The North American genus &quot;Sarracenia&quot; are the trumpet pitchers, which have a more complex trap than &quot;Heliamphora&quot;, with an operculum, which prevents excess accumulation of rainwater in most of the species. The single species in the California genus &quot;Darlingtonia&quot; is popularly known as the cobra plant, due to its possession of an inflated &quot;lid&quot; with elegant false-exits, and a forked &quot;tongue&quot;, which serves to ferry ants and other prey to the entrance of the pitcher. The species in the genus &quot;Sarracenia&quot; readily hybridize, making their classification a complex matter.

The purple pitcher plant, &quot;Sarracenia purpurea&quot;, is the floral emblem of the province of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.

=== Cephalotaceae ===
The Cephalotaceae is a monotypic family with but one genus and species, &quot;Cephalotus follicularis&quot;. This species has a small (2–5 cm) pitcher similar in form to those of &quot;Nepenthes&quot;. Unlike in &quot;Nepenthes&quot;, in &quot;Cephalotus&quot; &quot;follicularis&quot; the petiole is attached to the rear of the upper trap rim rather than to the base of the pitcher. The species occurs in only one location in southwestern Australia.

=== Bromeliaceae ===
A few species of bromeliads (Bromeliaceae), such as &quot;Brocchinia reducta&quot; and &quot;Catopsis berteroniana&quot;, are known or suspected to be carnivorous.

==Feeding behavior==

=== Attraction ===
Foraging, flying, or crawling insects such as flies are attracted to a cavity formed by the cupped leaf, often by visual lures such as anthocyanin pigments, and nectar. Many pitcher plants exhibit patterns of ultraviolet coloration which may play a role in attracting insects. Some species, such as &quot;Cephalotus follicularis&quot;, likely use camouflage to trap insects, as their coloration matches that of the surrounding environment and the plants are often embedded in the substrate such that the traps are flush with the ground.

Olfactory cues can also play a role in attraction. For example, &quot;Nepenthes rafflesian&quot;a uses flower-scent mimicry to attract insects to its pitchers.

=== Capture ===
The rim of the pitcher (peristome) is slippery when moistened by condensation or nectar, causing insects to fall into the trap. The walls of the pitfall may be covered with waxy scales, protruding aldehyde crystals, cuticular folds, downward-pointing hairs, or guard-cell-originating cells, to help prevent escape. The small bodies of liquid contained within the pitcher traps are called phytotelmata. They drown the insect, whose body is gradually dissolved. This may occur by bacterial action (the bacteria being washed into the pitcher by rainfall), or by digestive enzymes secreted by the plant itself. Pitcher trap fluids largely vary in their viscoelasticity and acidity, which then dictates which type of prey they can target. For example, increased viscoelasticity is associated with increased insect retention to help capture flying insects such as flies, whereas increased fluid acidity can decrease insect killing-time, which can help capture crawling insects such as ants. Some pitcher plants contain mutualistic insect larvae, which feed on trapped prey, and whose excreta the plant absorbs.

=== Digestion ===
Whatever the mechanism of digestion, the prey items are converted into a solution of amino acids, peptides, phosphates, ammonium and urea, from which the plant obtains its mineral nutrition (particularly nitrogen and phosphorus). Like all carnivorous plants, pitcher plants all grow in locations where the soil is too poor in minerals and/or too acidic for most plants to survive. Pitcher plants supplement available nutrients and minerals (which plants normally obtain through their roots) with the constituents of their insect prey.

=== Feces-trapping symbiosis===
Mature plants of &quot;Nepenthes lowii&quot; attract tree shrews (&quot;Tupaia montana&quot;), which feed on nectar that the plant produces but also defecate into the pitcher, providing nitrates and other nutrients. The plant and tree shrew have a symbiotic relationship. The rim of &quot;N. lowii&quot; is not slippery so that tree shrews can easily get in and out; it provides more nectar than other pitcher plants. The shape of the pitcher rim and the position of the nectar ensure that the animal&#x27;s hindquarters are over the rim while it feeds.

&quot;Nepenthes rafflesiana&quot; var. &quot;elongata&quot; has a similar relationship with Hardwicke&#x27;s woolly bats (&quot;Kerivoula hardwickii&quot;). The bats roost inside the pitchers and the plants derive much of their foliar nitrogen from the feces of the bats. Compared to other varieties of &quot;Nepenthes rafflesiana&quot; that do not exhibit this form of mutualism, &quot;N. rafflesiana&quot; var. &quot;elongata&quot; has elongated pitchers that can accommodate both single bats and mother-juvenile pairs. As well as its elongated shape, &quot;N. rafflesiana&quot; var. &quot;elongata&quot; has reduced volumes of pitcher fluid compared to other species, leaving more space to accommodate the bats.

==Evolution of the form==
It is widely assumed pitfall traps evolved by epiascidiation (infolding of the leaf with the adaxial or upper surface becoming the inside of the pitcher), with selection pressure favouring more deeply cupped leaves over evolutionary time. The pitcher trap evolved independently in three eudicot lineages and one monocot lineage, representing a case of convergent evolution. Some pitcher plant families (such as Nepenthaceae) are placed within clades consisting mostly of flypaper traps, indicating that some pitchers may have evolved from the common ancestors of today&#x27;s flypaper traps by loss of mucilage.

<text>Sarraceniaceae are a family of pitcher plants, belonging to order Ericales (reassigned from Nepenthales).

The family comprises three extant genera: &quot;Sarracenia&quot; (North American pitcher plants), &quot;Darlingtonia&quot; (the cobra lily or California pitcher plant), and &quot;Heliamphora&quot; (sun pitchers). The extinct &quot;Archaeamphora longicervia&quot; may also belong to this family, although later studies question that interpretation. All three are carnivorous plants that lure insects with nectar and use their elongated, tube-shaped leaves filled with water and digestive enzymes to catch and consume them. Digestive enzymes are not always produced by the plants themselves. Digestive mutualisms are common in Sarraceniaceae: both &quot;Sarracenia&quot; and &quot;Darlingtonia&quot; rely on commensal bacteria to supplement or produce all of their enzymes. Many species also use downward-pointing hairs and waxy secretions to make it difficult for insects to escape.

&quot;Sarracenia&quot; and &quot;Darlingtonia&quot; are native to North America, while &quot;Heliamphora&quot; is native to South America. Previous phylogenetic analysis suggests that the family originated in South America about 47 million years ago and spread to North America soon after, about 35 million years ago. The &quot;Sarracenia&quot; and &quot;Heliamphora&quot; clade diverged from &quot;Darlingtonia&quot; around this time, most likely due to a cooling event at the beginning of the Oligocene. &quot;Sarracenia&quot; diverged from &quot;Heliamphora&quot; later, around 23 million years ago. However, recent study found that the divergence times in Sarraceniaceae could be much older. The family could have originated about 88 million years ago during Late Cretaceous. The &quot;Sarracenia&quot; and &quot;Heliamphora&quot; clade could have diverged from &quot;Darlingtonia&quot; around 54 million years ago during Early Eocene. &quot;Sarracenia&quot; and &quot;Heliamphora&quot; could have split around 36 million years ago during Late Eocene.

These plants grow in nutrient-poor, often acidic soil and use the insects as a nutritional supplement. As such, growth of carnivorous pitchers is plastic: as soil nitrogen increases, &quot;Sarracenia&quot; produces fewer pitchers. The pitchers originate from a rhizome and die back during the winter dormancy. Plants of the genus &quot;Sarracenia&quot; occur mostly in &quot;Sphagnum&quot; bogs.

Most Sarraceniaceae have tall, narrow pitchers that are vertical or nearly so. &quot;Sarracenia purpurea&quot;, however, has short, squat, bulbous pitchers close to the ground, and &quot;Sarracenia psittacina&quot; has pitchers that grow horizontally.

The purple pitcher plant (&quot;Sarracenia purpurea&quot;) is the official flower of Newfoundland and Labrador.

<text>Glyndŵr&#x27;s Way () is a long-distance footpath in mid-Wales. It runs for in an extended loop through Powys between Knighton and Welshpool, and anchored on Machynlleth to the west.

== History ==

Its name derives from the early-15th-century Welsh prince and folk hero Owain Glyndŵr, whose parliament sat in Machynlleth in 1404. Glyndŵr&#x27;s Way was granted National Trail status in 2000 to mark the beginning of the third millennium and the 600th anniversary of an ill-fated but long-running and culturally significant rebellion in 1400.

== Route ==
The footpath officially begins in Knighton, on the English border, where it links with Offa&#x27;s Dyke Path. Running in roughly a horseshoe shape, it passes small market towns such as Llanidloes and quiet villages including Abbeycwmhir and Llanbadarn Fynydd, traversing central mid-Wales to Machynlleth near the Dyfi estuary and returning across Wales via Llanbrynmair, Llangadfan and Lake Vyrnwy and the valley of the River Vyrnwy to Welshpool from the Wales–England border.

The route passes nationally important Welsh natural habitats such as sessile oak woodlands, upland mire and heath, and ancient hedgerows. The area from Staylittle to Aberhosan is noted for its heather moorlands.

<doc id="113691" wikidata="Q912916" url="?curid=113691" title="Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport">
<text>Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport is a civil-military public international airport east of downtown Phoenix, in Maricopa County, Arizona, United States. It is Arizona&#x27;s largest and busiest airport; among the largest commercial airports in the United States, PHX was the 14th-busiest airport in the United States and 33rd-busiest in the world in 2021. The airport serves as a hub for American Airlines and a base for Frontier Airlines and Southwest Airlines.

The airport is also home to the 161st Air Refueling Wing (161 ARW), an Air Mobility Command (AMC)–gained unit of the Arizona Air National Guard. The military enclave is known as Goldwater Air National Guard Base. One of two flying units in the Arizona ANG, the 161 ARW flies the KC-135R Stratotanker aircraft. In addition to its domestic role as a National Guard unit, answering to the Governor of Arizona, the 161 ARW also performs both a stateside and overseas role as a USAF organization, supporting air refueling and air mobility missions worldwide.

==History==
===Early history===


Sky Harbor Airport&#x27;s evocative name was conceived by J. Parker Van Zandt, the owner of Scenic Airways, who purchased 278 acres of farmland for Scenic&#x27;s winter operations in November 1928. Sky Harbor was not only named but founded and built by Van Zandt in late 1928. He immediately commenced building a 100 x 120 foot airplane hangar and through early 1929 built one runway. This was the fourth airport built in Phoenix. Scenic Airways, lacking funds after the infamous Stock Market Crash of 1929, sold the airport to Acme Investment Company, which owned the airport until 1935, when the city of Phoenix purchased Sky Harbor airport from Acme for $100,000.

===Historical airline service===
On February 23, 1929, Maddux Air Lines began the airport&#x27;s first scheduled passenger service with a route between San Francisco and El Paso stopping in Phoenix, Los Angeles, and several other cities; however the service was short-lived, ending by autumn 1929. Standard Air Lines had been serving Phoenix since late 1927 at a different airport and began landing at Sky Harbor on August 5, 1929. Standard operated a route between Los Angeles and El Paso stopping at Phoenix, Tucson, and Douglas, Arizona. Standard was acquired by American Airways in 1930 which later became American Airlines. American extended the route eastward to New York by way of Dallas, Nashville, and many other cities making for a southern transcontinental route across the United States.
TWA began service to San Francisco in 1938 and added Phoenix onto its transcontinental network by 1944 with flights to Los Angeles and eastward to New York stopping at Albuquerque, Kansas City, and many more cities. Arizona Airways began intrastate service within Arizona in 1946 and merged into Frontier Airlines in 1950 which added new routes to Denver, Albuquerque, and El Paso. Bonanza Airlines began service by 1951 with a route to Las Vegas and Reno making several stops at smaller communities. New routes to Salt Lake City and Southern California were added in the 1960s along with nonstop flights to Las Vegas and Reno aboard Douglas DC-9 jets by 1965. Bonanza merged with two other carriers to become Air West in 1968 and was changed to Hughes Airwest in 1970 adding several new routes, including service to Mexico, creating a hub at Phoenix. Hughes Airwest was then merged into Republic Airlines in 1980 which continued the Phoenix hub operation until the mid-1980s. Western Airlines came to Sky Harbor in 1957 with flights to Denver, Los Angeles and San Diego, Continental Airlines came in 1961 to El Paso, Los Angeles, and Tucson, and Delta Air Lines began flights to Dallas by 1969.

Bonanza Air Lines moved its headquarters from Las Vegas to Phoenix in 1966. Bonanza merged with two other airlines to form Air West, which became Hughes Airwest after Howard Hughes bought it in 1970.

After the Airline Deregulation Act was signed in 1978, many new airlines began service to Sky Harbor. In 1978, former Hughes Airwest executive Ed Beauvais formed a plan for a new airline based in Phoenix. He founded America West Airlines in 1981, which began service from Phoenix in 1983 and doubled in size during its first year.Eastern Airlines and Allegheny Airlines soon began service in 1979 followed by United Airlines in 1980. Allegheny changed its name to USAir shortly after beginning service in 1979. Southwest Airlines arrived at Phoenix in January 1982 with 13 daily flights to 12 cities; by 1986 it had 64 daily flights from Phoenix and had a crew base there. Southwest opened a maintenance facility at PHX in 1992, which was its largest.

America West filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1991 and sold its larger aircraft and Japanese route authority, but continued growing its domestic operations from Terminal 4 in cooperation with Continental Airlines. Although AWA enjoyed further growth at Phoenix during the 1990s the aftermath of the September 11 attacks strained its financial position. AWA ended its relationship with Continental and merged with US Airways in 2005. US Airways moved its headquarters to the AWA campus in Tempe and retained many AWA managers to run the merged company. US Airways was then merged into American Airlines in 2015 which continues to build upon the largest hub operation at Phoenix Sky Harbor.

Sky Harbor landed its first transatlantic flights in 1996 when British Airways inaugurated nonstop service to London. The flight was first operated with a Douglas DC-10 aircraft but soon upgraded to a Boeing 747-400.

===Facilities expansions and growth===
After World War II, the airport began work on a new passenger terminal, as well as a new parallel runway and a diagonal runway. On the February 1953 C&amp;GS diagram runways 8L and 8R are each long and runway 3 is . The $835,000 Terminal 1 (originally called the West Wing), which also had the first control tower, opened in October 1952.

The airport&#x27;s master plan was redesigned in 1959 to eliminate the cross runway to make room for new terminals. American and TWA began jet service to Phoenix in 1960 and 1961 respectively, and Terminal 2 (originally called the East Wing) opened in 1962. Terminal 2 was designed by the Phoenix architectural firms of Weaver &amp; Drover and Lescher &amp; Mahoney and opened in 1962. Terminal 2 also featured a high and wide mural composed of 52 different materials, including mosaic glass, gemstones, shells, and vintage toys.

&quot;The Phoenix&quot;, designed by the late French-American artist and full-time resident of Phoenix Paul Coze, was commissioned in 1960 as Phoenix&#x27;s first work of public art and was installed in 1962 in the main lobby area of the terminal. &quot;The Phoenix&quot; was relocated to the Rental Car Center in 2021 following the decommissioning and demolition of Terminal 2. In November 2006, a Military and Veterans Hospitality Room, sponsored by the Phoenix Military and Veterans Commission, was opened in Terminal 2. It has since relocated to Terminal 4 as the new USO club. This terminal underwent two renovation projects. The first was completed in 1988. The second project, which cost $24 million and was designed by DWL Architects + Planners, Inc., was completed in 2007.

Construction on Terminal 3 began in January 1977. Designed by DWL Architects + Planners, Inc., Terminal 3 opened in October 1979, and the &quot;East&quot; and &quot;West&quot; names were dropped since there were no longer only two terminals.

In October 1989, ground was broken for Terminal 4, the largest terminal. It opened on November 2, 1990, with four concourses: N2 and N3 on the north side and S3 and S4 on the south side. In 1994 the N4 International Concourse was opened, adding 10 gates and a sterile walkway to the S4 concourse. In 1997 construction began on the 14-gate N1 concourse for America West Airlines. It was completed in June 1998 at a cost of $50 million, completing the expansion of the north side of the terminal. On the south side of the terminal, construction began in 2002 on the eight-gate S2 concourse for Southwest Airlines. This project was completed in 2004 and has a different architectural design from the other six concourses. The eighth and final concourse for Terminal 4 began construction in May 2019. Terminal 4 is named after former Arizona Senator and 1964 Presidential candidate Barry M. Goldwater. After Goldwater&#x27;s death in 1998, the then-mayor of Phoenix, Skip Rimsza, proposed renaming the airport in Goldwater&#x27;s memory but was deluged with public support for the familiar &quot;Sky Harbor&quot; name. Terminal 4, designed by DWL Architects + Planners, Inc., is the largest and busiest of the two terminals with 86 gates, divided into seven satellite concourses connected behind security.

In 2007, the Transportation Security Administration introduced the first of its backscatter X-ray machines at PHX.

===Recent developments===
In February 2020, Terminal 2 accepted its final flight and was then decommissioned. Demolition occurred in early 2021 with the terminal being replaced by concrete stands for aircraft, accessible by bus from other terminals. Airlines previously using Terminal 2 were relocated to Terminal 3, which had completed renovations in January 2020.

In January 2021, Terminal 3 was renamed in honor of Senator John McCain by the Phoenix City Council.

In February 2024, the airport announced plans for infrastructure upgrades at its central utility plant in Terminal 4, which will improve air conditioning at the airport. The $36 million project was funded by a FAA Airport Terminal Program grant included in the federal Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act that was signed into law by President Joe Biden.

On April 29, 2024, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego announced that a new terminal would be constructed on the west end of the property near the former location of Terminal 2. She said that in 2023 the airport welcomed more than 48 million passengers and with continued growth expected the new terminal was needed to accommodate growing demand and handle the increased number of travelers. The terminal would feature a new customs facility and would be designed to have net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, making it an environmentally friendly structure.

On December 17, 2024, PHX achieved a major milestone. For the first time in its long history, the airport surpassed the 50 million passenger mark in a calendar year, an all-time record for the facility.

==== Christmas Day shooting and stabbing ====
On December 25, 2024, an apparent family dispute among a group of five at a restaurant in Terminal 4 escalated into a shooting and stabbing, leaving three with gunshot wounds and another with a stab wound. A man and a juvenile female were detained as a result of the incident. After the domestic incident, a man allegedly responding to false reports of an active shooter at the airport arrived at the airport shirtless and armed. The man had an altercation with police before he was also arrested.

==Facilities==
===Terminals===

The airport has 117 active aircraft gates in two Terminals (3 and 4). The airport administration states that the designations Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 have been &quot;retired&quot; and that it did not wish to renumber the other terminals since passengers were already familiar with the numbers in place. Terminals 3 and 4 continued to retain their numbers after the closing of Terminal 2. Bus gates are planned to be operated on the Terminal 2 site. Terminal 3 is used by most domestic or precleared arrivals including Frontier Airlines. Alaska Airlines also uses Terminal 3 for both its arrivals and departures. International carriers, American and Southwest operate in Terminal 4.

*Terminal 3 contains 25 gates.
*Terminal 4 contains 92 gates.

===Runways===
PHX covers at an elevation of . The airport has three parallel concrete/grooved runways:
* Runway 8/26 measuring 
* Runway 7L/25R measuring 
* Runway 7R/25L measuring 

All three runways can accommodate aircraft with a maximum takeoff weight of or greater.

Sky Harbor&#x27;s private airplane area is also one of eight service centers for the Medevac airline Air Evac.

===ATC tower===
The airport&#x27;s air traffic control tower began operations on January 14, 2007. It stands just east of the Terminal 3 parking garage and also houses the Phoenix TRACON. This is Sky Harbor&#x27;s third control tower and is among the tallest control towers in North America.

===Museum===
The Phoenix Airport Museum is a museum displaying artwork and local aviation memorabilia located inside the terminal.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===

The following airlines operate regularly scheduled passenger flights at Sky Harbor Airport:

==Statistics==
From 1951 through the end of 2024, 1,477,505,366 passengers (domestic and international, enplaned and deplaned) have transited through PHX, an annual average of 19,966,289 passengers. In the same time frame there were 30,033,280 million aircraft movements (commercial, military, general aviation) at PHX, an annual average of 405,855 movements. PHX has grown over the years into a major US hub, and in 2023 was ranked the 33rd-busiest airport in the world and 14th-busiest airport in the United States in passenger boardings.

==Ground transportation==

Travelers can access both terminals from the East Economy Parking by using the PHX Sky Train. There is also terminal parking adjacent to each terminal. The airport continues to provide shuttle bus service between the terminals and the rental car center with separate routes serving each terminal until the PHX Sky Train project is complete.

Valley Metro bus route 13 has a stop near the Airport&#x27;s Operations building, west of Terminal 3. Travelers connecting to or from the Greyhound station can use the Valley Metro route 13 bus. The Valley Metro Rail has a stop at the nearby 44th St/Washington light rail station. A moving sidewalk bridge over Washington Street allows light rail passengers to arrive at the nearby PHX Sky Train station and then onward to stations at the East Economy Parking Lot and Terminals 3 and 4. Valley Metro bus routes 44 serve the PHX Sky Train station at 44th Street and Washington.

A number of taxi, limousine, ride share and shuttle companies provide service between each airport terminal, the Phoenix metropolitan area, and other communities throughout the state.

By road, the airport terminals are served by East Sky Harbor Boulevard, which is fed by Interstate 10, Arizona State Routes 143 and 202.

===PHX Sky Train===
The PHX Sky Train is an automated people-mover, much like those found at other airports, that transports Sky Harbor passengers from the 44th Street and Washington Light Rail station to Sky Harbor&#x27;s East Economy Parking lot, through both terminals. Phase 1 opened on April 8, 2013, and runs from the 44th Street and Washington Light Rail station, to East Economy Parking and on to Terminal 4. Phase 1A shuttles passengers to Terminal 3.

<text>Offa&#x27;s Dyke Path () is a long-distance footpath loosely following the Wales–England border. Officially opened on 10 July 1971, by Lord Hunt, it is one of Britain&#x27;s National Trails and draws walkers from throughout the world. About of the route either follows, or keeps close company with, the remnants of Offa&#x27;s Dyke, an earthwork traditionally thought to have been constructed in the late 8th century on the orders of King Offa of Mercia.

== Walking trail ==

Traveling south to north, starting by the Severn Estuary at Sedbury, near Chepstow, and finishing at Prestatyn on the north coast, the walk will take an average walker roughly 12 days to complete. Roughly following the border in parts, and elsewhere the ancient monument of Offa&#x27;s Dyke, as well as natural features such as the Hatterrall Ridge, the Dyke Path passes through a variety of landscapes. The route traces the eastern edge of the Black Mountains, traverses Clun Forest, the Eglwyseg moors north of Llangollen and the Clwydian Range.

The route passes through the counties of Monmouthshire, Gloucestershire, Powys, Herefordshire, Shropshire, Wrexham, Denbighshire and Flintshire. The Welsh Marches (Marchia Wallie) is a term used to describe this border region between England and Wales, since it was recorded in the Domesday Book in 1086. It passes through, or close to, the towns of Chepstow, Monmouth, Hay-on-Wye, Kington, Presteigne, Knighton, Montgomery, Welshpool and Oswestry, then in and around the North Wales towns and villages of Llangollen, Llandegla, Bodfari and Dyserth.

The half-way point of the path is marked by the Offa&#x27;s Dyke Centre in Knighton (). There used to be around 600 stiles along the route, but many of these have now been replaced by kissing gates.

==Promotion and media==
Various bodies on either side of the border are collaborating on a sustainable tourism partnership, a principal focus of which is &quot;Walking with Offa&quot;, both on the trail but also in what has been dubbed Offa&#x27;s Country i.e. in a corridor along the border.

The path was the focus of an episode of the Channel 4 program &quot;Britain&#x27;s Ancient Tracks with Tony Robinson&quot;.

In June 2021, during the footpath&#x27;s 50th year, an Offa&#x27;s Dyke Rescue Fund was launched to restore eroded and other damaged parts of the route and to buy parts of the path at risk of sustained damage or negligence from local land owners. The fund is working in consultation with Cadw and English Heritage and the National Trail Unit.

On 22 August 2021, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Countryfile&quot; programme celebrated 50 years of the path.

<doc id="113700" wikidata="Q2181840" url="?curid=113700" title="Tintin and Alph-Art">
<text>Tintin and Alph-Art () is the unfinished twenty-fourth and final volume of &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;, the comics series by Belgian cartoonist Hergé. Left incomplete on Hergé&#x27;s death, the manuscript was posthumously published in 1986. The story revolves around Brussels&#x27; modern art scene, where the young reporter Tintin discovers that a local art dealer has been murdered. Investigating further, he encounters a conspiracy of art forgery, masterminded by a religious teacher named Endaddine Akass.

Reflecting his own fascination for modern art, Hergé began work on &quot;Tintin and Alph-Art&quot; in 1978. However, it was left unfinished at the time of his death in March 1983. At this point it consisted of around 150 pages of pencil-drawn notes, outlines and sketches – not yet rendered in Hergé&#x27;s trademark &quot;ligne claire&quot; drawing style – with no ending having been devised for the story. Hergé&#x27;s colleague Bob de Moor offered to complete the story for publication, and while Hergé&#x27;s widow Fanny Vlamynck initially agreed, she changed her decision, citing the fact that her late husband had not wanted anyone else to continue &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;.

A selection of the original notes were collected together and published in book form by Casterman in 1986. Since that point, several other cartoonists, such as Yves Rodier, have produced their own finished, unauthorized versions of the story. Critical reception of the work has been mixed; some commentators on &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; believe that if &quot;Tintin and Alph-Art&quot; had been completed, it would have been an improvement over the previous two volumes, while others have characterised such assessments as wishful thinking.

==Synopsis==
Tintin and Captain Haddock receive a phone call from their friend, the opera singer Bianca Castafiore, who informs them about a new spiritual leader whom she has begun following, Endaddine Akass, stating her intention to stay at his villa in Ischia. Later that day, Haddock enters the Fourcart Gallery in Brussels, where Jamaican avant-garde artist Ramó Nash convinces him to purchase one of his &quot;Alph-Art&quot; works, a perspex letter &quot;H&quot; (&quot;Personalph-Art&quot;). The gallery&#x27;s owner, Henri Fourcart, arranges to meet Tintin, but is killed in a car accident while on his way to do so. Tintin begins to investigate, discovering that Fourcart&#x27;s death was murder. Tintin and Haddock attend one of Akass&#x27; lectures; there, Tintin recognises Akass&#x27; voice, but is unsure why. Investigating further, he concludes that Akass was spying on Fourcart through a micro-transmitter hidden in a pendant worn by the latter&#x27;s assistant, Martine Vandezande. Tintin soon faces a number of attacks designed to kill him, but survives both.

To further his investigations, Tintin decides to visit Akass&#x27; villa. Arriving at Ischia, Tintin and Haddock receive death threats warning them to leave. When Castafiore hears that they are on the island, she welcomes them to Akass&#x27; villa, informing them that Akass himself is in Rome. At the villa, they meet a number of acquaintances, the corrupt industrialists W.R. Gibbons (from &quot;The Blue Lotus&quot;) and R.W. Trickler (from &quot;The Broken Ear&quot;), Emir Ben Kalish Ezab (from &quot;Land of Black Gold&quot;), Luigi Randazzo (a singer), and Ramó Nash. Tintin and Haddock stay the night at the villa on Castafiore&#x27;s insistence. During the night, Tintin witnesses men loading canvases into a van, and exploring the villa discovers a room full of faked paintings by prominent artists. He is discovered by Akass, who informs him that he uses Nash&#x27;s &quot;Alph-Art&quot; as a front for his criminal forgery business. Akass declares his intention to kill Tintin by having him covered in liquid polyester and sold as a work of art by César Baldaccini.

==History==
=== Background ===
In 1976, a few months after the publication of &quot;Tintin and the Picaros&quot;, Hergé told the journalist Numa Sadoul that he was contemplating setting the next &quot;Adventure of Tintin&quot; in an airport lounge. This idea was dropped, and in 1978, he decided to set the story in the world of modern art. During his later years Hergé had grown increasingly interested in this subject, and decided to incorporate his love of avant-garde artwork into the new story. Being a regular at Brussels&#x27; art galleries and exhibitions, he was able to draw directly upon his experiences in the art scene when producing the story. Given his age, and the length of time that it was taking him to produce each &quot;Adventure&quot;, British literary critic Michael Farr suggested that Hergé likely knew that this would be his final installment in the series.

Hergé initially titled this new work &quot;Tintin et les Faussaires&quot; (&quot;Tintin and the Forgers&quot;) before changing this working title to &quot;Tintin et L&#x27;Alph-Art&quot;. The story&#x27;s main antagonist, Endaddine Akass, was based on a real-life art forger, Fernand Legros, whom Hergé had learned about through reading a biography of him. The Akass character was also influenced by an article about the Indian guru Rajneesh which Hergé had read in a December 1982 edition of the &quot;Paris Match&quot;. In Hergé&#x27;s notes, he included the idea of revealing that Akass was Tintin&#x27;s nemesis, Rastapopoulos, in disguise, with Farr believing that this plot twist would have been revealed had Hergé completed the story. Conversely, Harry Thompson suggested that Hergé had dropped Rastapopoulos from the story in 1980. Hergé&#x27;s notes reveal that he considered various different names for the artist character, including Ramon Hasj and Ramo Nasj, before settling on Ramo Nash. Similarly, he had initially debated whether Nash should be a painter or a sculptor, before deciding on the latter.

Three months before he died, Hergé stated that &quot;unfortunately I cannot say much about this forthcoming Tintin adventure because, though I started it three years ago, I have not had much time to work on it and still do not know how it will turn out. I know very roughly where I am going... I am continuing my research and I really do not know where this story will lead me&quot;.
Upon his death, Hergé left around one hundred and fifty pages of pencil sketches for the story. The story itself had no ending, and is left on a cliffhanger, with Tintin&#x27;s fate left unexplained.

Hergé&#x27;s main assistant, Bob de Moor, showed an interest in completing the book following Hergé&#x27;s death. As De Moor explained, &quot;Personally I would have loved to finish &quot;Alph-Art&quot;. It would have been a tribute to Hergé. Fanny Remi asked me to finish it, and I began work on it, but after a few months she changed her mind. I didn&#x27;t insist, but for me it was logical that there was a studio, there were artists in the studio, Casterman asked for it to be finished, there were twenty-three finished books, that one story was not finished; so I had to finish it&quot;.
In the end, Fanny decided Hergé would not have approved and the book must remain unfinished. Hergé had made it clear that he did not want anyone else to continue &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot; after his death, informing Sadoul that &quot;after me there will be no more Tintin. Tintin is my creation—my blood, my sweat, my guts&quot;.

===Publication===
Fanny ultimately decided that Hergé&#x27;s unfinished sketches could be published in book form. To do so, the sketches were edited by a team of experts, including Benoît Peeters, Michel Bareau and Jean-Manuel Duvivier, with forty-four being selected for publication. The book produced devoted one half to reproducing the sketches, and the other to producing a of Hergé&#x27;s text for the story. Published on 8 October 1986 by Casterman, it proved to be a bestseller despite its high cover price.
An English language translation was published in 1990.

==Critical analysis==
For Michael Farr, &quot;Tintin and Alph-Art&quot; provided &quot;an almost perfect ending to more than fifty years of defying danger, threats to his life and a succession of villains&quot;. He believed that it was &quot;full of a vigour and enthusiasm disappointingly absent from the two previous adventures&quot;, and that as a result &quot;it promised to be Hergé&#x27;s most accomplished Tintin story for twenty years&quot;. Jean-Marc Lofficier and Randy Lofficier stated that had the story been completed, it &quot;may have turned out to be a smaller-scale, unpretentious yet far more exciting and true-to-life adventure&quot; than various recent volumes.
Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters felt that &quot;despite its limitations, and perhaps on account of them, this unfinished story fits perfectly alongside the other 23 Tintin adventures. Full of promise, it ends the series admirably by leaving the last word to every reader&#x27;s imagination&quot;. Philippe Goddin opined that &quot;Tintin and Alph-Art&quot;&#x27;s opening &quot;promised much, coming like new breath&quot;.

In a later publication, Peeters expressed a different view, stating that &quot;one cannot help but feel disappointed&quot; with &quot;Alph-Art&quot;. Similarly, Harry Thompson expressed the view that Hergé would never have completed the story, and that while &quot;many critics like to think... &quot;Tintin and Alph-Art&quot; was set to be Hergé&#x27;s last great masterpiece&quot;, he disagreed, describing this as &quot;surely just wishful thinking&quot;. He added that it could be seen as &quot;a nostalgic, or regressive book, depending on your point of view&quot;.

The literary critic Tom McCarthy suggested that some of the early scenes of the book &quot;take the form almost of Platonic dialogues, dramatized theoretical discussions about art itself&quot;, although later in the book Hergé turns to revealing &quot;the deeper and more essential Platonic truth of art: that it is fake, that its whole currency is fakeness&quot;. Discussing the final scene in the book, he opined that it &quot;reads like a snuff movie: not of Tintin, ultimately, but of Hergé&quot;. Further, he argued that &quot;Tintin and Alph-Art&quot; reflected a number of themes that also appear in other &quot;Adventures of Tintin&quot;; these include the idea of Castafiore bridging the connection between the protagonist and the villains, and the concept of Haddock being confronted &quot;with his own inauthenticity&quot;, in this case through purchasing a giant plastic &#x27;H&#x27; artwork.

==Adaptations and exhibitions==
Other artists have produced a number of pastiche versions of the story, which provide their own endings. In 1987, a version was completed by an artist using the pseudonym of Ramó Nash. Several further versions were produced by the Canadian artist Yves Rodier during the 1990s. A further version appeared in the 1990s, produced by an individual known as Regric.

In honour of Hergé&#x27;s legacy, the awards given at the Angoulême International Comics Festival were named Alph-Art Awards, having previously been named after Alain Saint-Ogan&#x27;s character Alfred.

In November 2015, Somerset House in London held the exhibition &quot;Tintin: Hergé&#x27;s Masterpiece&quot;, which featured the final sketch from &quot;Tintin and Alph-Art&quot; as one of its displays.

<text>Inbetweening, also known as tweening, is a process in animation that involves creating intermediate frames, called inbetweens, between two keyframes. The intended result is to create the illusion of movement by smoothly transitioning one image into another.
== Traditional animation ==
Traditional inbetweening involves the use of a light table to draw a set of pencil and paper drawings.

The process of inbetweening in traditional animation starts with a primary artist, who draws key frames to define movement. After the testing and approval of a rough animation, the scene is passed down to assistants, who perform clean-up and add necessary inbetweening. In large studios, assistants usually add breakdowns, which define the movement in more detail. The scene is then passed down to another assistant, the inbetweener, who completes the animation. In small animation teams, animators will often carry out the full inbetweening process themselves.

Dick Huemer developed this system in the 1920s, and it has become widely used due to its efficiency. Art Davis is said to be the first Inbetweener.

== Frame frequency ==

Typically, the key animator does not make drawings for all 24 frames required for one second of film length. In large studios, a specialized inbetweener artist fills in the gaps between the key drawings. Only very fast movements require 24 drawings per second, which is referred to as animating &quot;on ones&quot;. Most movements can be done with 12 drawings per second—called animating &quot;on twos&quot;, drawing one out of every two frames. When the number of in-betweens is too few, such as four drawings per second, an animation may begin to lose the illusion of the movement altogether. Computer-generated animation is usually animated &quot;on ones.&quot; Frame frequency often varies depending on animation style and is an artistic choice. Animation &quot;on twos&quot; has been used for over 100 years; &quot;Fantasmagorie&quot; (1908), widely considered the first fully animated movie, was animated on twos.

Modern animation uses various techniques to adapt frame rates. Slow movements may be animated on threes or fours. Different components of a shot might be animated at different frame ratesfor example, a character in a panning shot might be animated &quot;on twos&quot;, while everything in the shot is shifted every frame (&quot;on ones&quot;) to accomplish a panning effect. Optical effects such as motion blur may be used to simulate the appearance of a higher frame rate.

== Digital animation ==
When animating in a digital context, the shortened term &quot;tweening&quot; is commonly used, and the resulting sequence of frames is called a &quot;tween&quot;. Sophisticated animation software enables the animator to specify objects in an image and to define how they should move and change during the tweening process. The software may be used to manually render or adjust transitional frames by hand or may be used to automatically render transitional frames using interpolation of graphic parameters.

Some of the earliest software that utilises automatic interpolation in the realm of digital animation includes Adobe Flash and Animo (developed by Cambridge Animation Systems) in the late 90s, and Tweenmaker, released around 2006. The free software program Synfig specializes in automated tweening.

&quot;Ease-in&quot; and &quot;ease-out&quot; in digital animation typically refer to a mechanism for defining the physics of the transition between two animation states, i.e., the linearity of a tween. For example, an ease-in transition would start the animation out slowly, and then progressively get faster as the animation continues. An ease-out transition does the opposite, where the animation starts out quickly but then slows down.

The use of computers for inbetweening was enhanced by Nestor Burtnyk and Marceli Wein at the National Research Council of Canada. They received a Technical Achievement Academy Award in 1997, for &quot;pioneering work in the development of software techniques for computer-assisted keyframing for character animation&quot;.
