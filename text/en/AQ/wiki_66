<text>Peoria ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Peoria County, Illinois, United States. Located on the Illinois River, the city had a population of 113,150 as of the 2020 census, making it the eighth-most populous city in Illinois. It is the principal city of the Peoria metropolitan area in Central Illinois, consisting of the counties of Fulton, Marshall, Peoria, Stark, Tazewell, and Woodford which had a population of 402,391 in 2020.

Established in 1691 by the French explorer Henri de Tonti, Peoria is the oldest permanent European settlement in Illinois, according to the Illinois State Archaeological Survey. Originally known as Fort Clark, it received its current name when the County of Peoria was organized in 1825. The city was named after the Peoria people, a member of the Illinois Confederation. On October 16, 1854, Abraham Lincoln made his Peoria speech against the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Prior to prohibition, Peoria was the center of the whiskey industry in the United States. More than 12 distilleries operated in Peoria by the end of the 19th century, more than any other city in the U.S.

A major port on the Illinois River, Peoria is a trading and shipping center for a large agricultural area that produces corn, soybeans, and livestock. Although the economy is well diversified, the city&#x27;s traditional manufacturing industries remain important and produce earthmoving equipment, metal products, lawn-care equipment, labels, steel towers, farm equipment, building materials, steel, wire, and chemicals. Until 2018, Peoria was the global and national headquarters for heavy equipment and engine manufacturer Caterpillar Inc., one of the 30 companies composing the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and listed on the Fortune 100; the company relocated its headquarters to Deerfield, Illinois, in 2018, and then Irving, Texas, in 2022.

The city is associated with the phrase &quot;Will it play in Peoria?&quot;, which may have originated from the vaudeville era and is often spuriously attributed to Groucho Marx. Museums in the city include the Peoria Riverfront Museum, the Pettengill–Morron House and the John C. Flanagan House (both of which are managed by the Peoria Historical Society), and the Peoria Playhouse Children&#x27;s Museum. Wheels o&#x27; Time Museum is near Peoria.

==History==

Peoria is the oldest European settlement in Illinois, as explorers first ventured up the Illinois River from the Mississippi. The lands that eventually would become Peoria were first settled by Europeans in 1680, when French explorers René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle and Henri de Tonti constructed Fort Crevecoeur. This fort would later burn to the ground, and in 1813, Fort Clark, Illinois was built. When the County of Peoria was organized in 1825, Fort Clark was officially named Peoria.

Peoria was named after the Peoria tribe, a member of the Illinois Confederation. The original meaning of the word is uncertain. A 21st-century proposal suggests a derivation from a Proto-Algonquian word meaning &quot;to dream with the help of a manitou.&quot; Peoria was incorporated as a village on March 11, 1835. The city did not have a mayor, though they had a village president, Rudolphus Rouse, who served from 1835 to 1836. The first Chief of Police, John B Lishk, was appointed in 1837. The city was incorporated on April 21, 1845. This was the end of a village president and the start of the mayoral system, with the first mayor being William Hale.

Peoria, Arizona, a suburb of Phoenix, was named after Peoria, Illinois because the two men who founded it in 1890 − Joseph B. Greenhut and Deloss S. Brown − wished to name it after their hometown. Peoria was significant in the world of bicycle racing during the late 19th century. Held at Lake View Park, its U.S. bicycle racing stop hosted such notable names as Marshall &quot;Major&quot; Taylor, who would later become world champion. Taylor described Peoria as the &quot;Mecca&quot; for the sport. For much of the 20th century, a red-light district of brothels and bars known as the Merry-Go-Round was part of Peoria.

Richard Pryor got his start as a performer on North Washington Street in the early 1960s. In 2021, Rita Ali became Peoria&#x27;s first female and African American mayor.

===Notable events===
* September 19 to October 21, 1813 – Peoria War
* 1844 – Abraham Lincoln came to Peoria to get involved in the Aquilla Wren divorce case and took it to the Supreme Court of Illinois
* April 15, 1926 – Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s first air mail route, Contract Air Mail route #2, began running mail from Chicago to Peoria to Springfield to St. Louis and back. There is nothing to substantiate the local legend that Lindbergh offered Peoria the chance to sponsor his trans-Atlantic flight and call his plane the &quot;Spirit of Peoria,&quot; but he does state that he first pondered the journey after taking off from the Peoria air mail field.
* 1942 – &quot;Penicillium chrysogenum&quot;, the fungus originally used to industrially produce penicillin, was first isolated from a moldy cantaloupe found in a grocery store in Peoria.
* Local legend is that Theodore Roosevelt called Grandview Drive, a street on the bluffs overlooking the Illinois River &quot;the world&#x27;s most beautiful drive&quot; during his visit in 1910. However, no contemporaneous accounts of this story appeared, even in local papers and histories, for over two decades after it supposedly occurred. A related legend claims that the Peoria radio station and CBS television affiliate, WMBD, chose its call sign based on this story. In fact, the WMBD letters were assigned randomly and the meaning behind it was invented after the fact in 1927.

==Economy==
===Industry===
Peoria&#x27;s first major industry was started in 1830 by John Hamlin and John Sharp, who constructed the flour mill on Kickapoo Creek. In 1837, another industry was begun with E.F. Nowland&#x27;s pork planting industry. Many other industries started slowly in Peoria including carriage factories, pottery makers, wholesale warehousing, casting foundries, glucose factories, ice harvesting, and furniture makers. Peoria became the first world leader for distilleries thanks to Andrew Eitle (1837), Almiron S. Cole (1844), and Joseph B. Greenhut. Between 1837 and 1919, Peoria held over 24 distilleries and 73 breweries. Together, they produced the highest amount of internal revenue tax on alcohol (also known as &#x27;Sin Tax&#x27;) of any single revenue district in the entire United States; as much as 50% of tax revenue during the Civil War came from Peoria&#x27;s district, largely due to distilleries and breweries. Peoria also was one of the major bootlegging areas during Prohibition and home to the famed mobsters, the Shelton brothers. That great success placed Peoria into a building boom of beautiful private homes, schools, parks, churches, as well as municipal buildings.

In addition to the distilleries came farm machinery manufacturing by William Nurse in 1837. Also, two men called Toby and Anderson brought the steel plow circa 1843, which gained immediate success. The dominant manufacturing companies in Peoria were Kingman Plow Co., Acme Harvester Co., Selby, Starr &amp; Co., and Avery Manufacturing Co. In 1889, Keystone Steel &amp; Wire developed the first wire fence and has since been the nation&#x27;s leading manufacturer.

Around the 1880s, businesses such as Rouse Hazard Co. in Peoria, were dealers and importers of bicycles and accessories worldwide. Charles Duryea, one of the cycle manufacturers, developed the first commercially available gasoline-powered automobile in the U.S. in 1893. At the time agricultural implement production declined, which led the earth moving and tractor equipment companies to skyrocket and make Peoria in this field the world leader. In 1925, Caterpillar Tractor Co. was formed from California-based companies, Benjamin Holt Co. and the C.L. Best Tractor Co. Robert G. LeTourneau&#x27;s earth moving company began its production of new scrapers and dozers in 1935, which evolved into Komatsu-Dresser, Haulpak Division. Today, the joint venture between Komatsu and Dresser Industries has long since passed; Komatsu bought out Dresser in 1996. The entity that remains is the off-highway truck manufacturing division for Komatsu America Corporation. In September 2024, Komatsu Limited announced that it was &quot;enhancing its Peoria operations by constructing a new office building that will provide a collaborative space for engineering, sales, manufacturing, management and other functions.&quot; The new building is planned to be completed by the end of 2025.

The world headquarters for Caterpillar Inc. was based in Peoria for over 110 years until the company announced it was moving to Deerfield, Illinois in late-2017. It still remains a significant economic driver in the city, and is Peoria&#x27;s the second-biggest employer. 

Health care has become a major part of Peoria&#x27;s economy. Peoria was ranked as the sixth midsize healthcare hub in the country by Business Facilities in 2021.

Since 2021, OSF HealthCare has been the city&#x27;s top employer, rising from fourth in 2014. Headquartered in Peoria since its founding in 1877, and it relocated its headquarters to a newly-renovated building in downtown Peoria in 2022. In February 2024, OSF Healthcare opened the $250 million OSF HealthCare Cancer Institute. It also includes the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Illinois.

In 2023, Carle Health finalized a deal to purchase Methodist and Proctor Hospitals from UnityPoint. It is currently the third-biggest employer in the city, behind OSF HealthCare and Caterpillar Inc.

In addition to the three major hospitals, the USDA&#x27;s National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research, formerly called the USDA Northern Regional Research Lab, is located in Peoria. This is one of the labs where mass production of penicillin was developed.

The Peoria NEXT Innovation Center opened in August 2007 and provides both dry and wet labs, as well as conference and office space for emerging start-up companies. Over $2 billion in research is conducted in Peoria annually. While the Renaissance Park research park project never came to full fruition, many of the original ideas from the original Renaissance Park concept still continue on a smaller level via The Renaissance Park Community Association.

===Transportation===

====Interstate and U.S. routes====
The Peoria area is served by three Interstate highways: Interstate 74, which runs from northwest to southeast through the downtown area, Interstate 474, a southern bypass of I-74 through portions of Peoria and the suburbs of Bartonville and Creve Coeur, and Interstate 155, which runs south from I-74 in Morton to Interstate 55 in Lincoln which connects to Springfield and St. Louis. I-74 crosses over the Illinois River via the Murray Baker Bridge, while I-474 crosses via the Shade-Lohmann Bridge. The nearest metropolitan centers accessible on I-74 are the Quad Cities to the west, and Bloomington-Normal to the east.

From 2004 to 2006, Interstate 74 between Interstate 474 on the west and Illinois Route 8 on the east was reconstructed as part of the Upgrade 74 project. In addition, U.S. Route 150 serves as the main arterial for the northern portion of the Peoria area, becoming War Memorial Drive before heading west towards Kickapoo. It enters from the McClugage Bridge; east of the bridge, then runs southeast to Morton. U.S. Route 24 runs concurrently with Interstate 474 in the southwest portion of the city.

====State routes====
The following state routes run through Peoria:
* Illinois Route 6 runs along the northwestern portion of the city as an extension of I-474. It is a four-lane freeway that runs from the I-74/474 intersection northeast to Illinois Route 29 south of Chillicothe. It is marked as a north–south road.
* Illinois Route 8 roughly parallels I-74 to the south. It enters Peoria from Elmwood and runs southeast through the city, passing just southwest of the downtown area. Illinois 8 crosses into East Peoria via the Cedar Street Bridge with 116. Illinois 8 is marked as an east–west road.
* Illinois Route 29 runs through Peoria along the Illinois River from Chillicothe through downtown Peoria. It then joins Interstate 74 across the Murray Baker Bridge. Illinois 29 is marked as a north–south road, and is called Galena Road north of U.S. 150.
* Illinois Route 40 (formerly 88) enters Peoria from the north as Knoxville Avenue. It runs south through the center of the city and exits southeast over the Bob Michel Bridge. Illinois 40 is marked as a north–south road.
* Illinois Route 91 briefly enters Peoria at the intersection with U.S. 150 in the far northwestern portion of the city. Traffic on Illinois 91 mainly accesses The Shoppes at Grand Prairie, or continues to Dunlap.
* Illinois Route 116 enters from the west at Bellevue. It runs directly east and crosses into East Peoria over the Cedar Street Bridge.

The planned Illinois Route 336 project will also connect Illinois 336 with I-474 between Illinois 8 and Illinois 116. Construction on the segment nearest Peoria has not started, nor has funding been allocated.

====Rail transportation====
Peoria remains a major freight hub but its minor passenger service has been waning since the 1950s.

Metro Peoria is served by ten common carrier railroads. Four are Class I railroads: BNSF, Canadian National, Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific. The latter has a north–south oriented line which skirts the west edge of the city but a line branches off of it to enter Peoria. One Class II/Regional, Iowa Interstate, serves the city, coming out of Bureau Junction, Illinois. Five Class III/Shortline railroads: Central Illinois Railroad, which operates a portion of the city-owned Peoria, Peoria Heights and Western Railroad; three Genesee &amp; Wyoming-owned operations: Toledo, Peoria &amp; Western Railway, which runs next to US 24 east to Logansport, Indiana (formally owned by Rail America), Illinois &amp; Midland Railroad (the former Chicago &amp; Illinois Midland, comes up from Springfield and Havana) and Tazewell &amp; Peoria Railroad (leases the Peoria &amp; Pekin Union Railway from its owners Canadian National, Norfolk Southern and Union Pacific); Pioneer Railcorp&#x27;s Keokuk Junction Railway (which now owns the Toledo, Peoria and Western&#x27;s West End from Lomax and La Harpe in Western Illinois, plus the branch from Keokuk).

Several Midwestern railroads served Peoria Union Station until 1955. The Rock Island Railroad operated trains into its Rock Island Depot until 1978, when they discontinued the &quot;Peoria Rocket&quot;. East Peoria was served by Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Prairie Marksman&quot; (Chicago–East Peoria) until 1981. Peoria is currently the second largest city in Illinois without passenger rail service; the closest passenger stations are Galesburg (served by Amtrak&#x27;s Chicago–Los Angeles &quot;Southwest Chief&quot;) and Bloomington (served by Amtrak&#x27;s Chicago-St. Louis &quot;Lincoln Service&quot;). A study of East Peoria–Bloomington passenger rail service was published in 2011. Plans for the proposed service, which would have connected with Amtrak&#x27;s Lincoln Service at Bloomington, were abandoned due to financial considerations.

A study of Peoria–Chicago passenger rail service was published in July 2022. The study, conducted by IDOT at the request of a Passenger Rail Committee established in August 2021, estimated that startup costs for the proposed service would be $2.54 billion. The service would be operated by Amtrak and would have intermediate stops at LaSalle-Peru, Utica, Ottawa, Morris, and Joliet. The trip between Peoria and Chicago would take about hours. Committee members, who met with federal transportation officials and Amtrak&#x27;s CEO, were hopeful about securing funding.

====Public transportation====
Public bus service is provided by the Greater Peoria Mass Transit District, which operates 17 bus routes under the name CityLink that serve the city, Illinois Central College, and much of East Peoria, Peoria Heights, West Peoria in addition to points between Peoria and Pekin.

====Aviation====
General Wayne A. Downing Peoria International Airport is located west of Peoria. The airport is served by United Express, American Eagle, Allegiant Air, and numerous cargo carriers.

Mount Hawley Auxiliary Airport, on the north end of the city, is a general aviation airport.

==Peoria in popular culture==
The theme of Peoria as the archetypal example of middle American culture runs throughout American culture, appearing in movies and books, on television and radio, and in countless advertisements as either a filler place name or the representative of mainstream taste, hence the phrase &quot;Will it play in Peoria?&quot;

Mudvayne, an alternative metal band was founded in Peoria in 1996. Published posthumously in 2011, David Foster Wallace&#x27;s unfinished novel &quot;The Pale King&quot; features vignettes based in Peoria.

==Sister cities==
Peoria&#x27;s sister cities include:
* Aitou, Lebanon
* Benxi, China
* Clonmel, Ireland
* Friedrichshafen, Germany

<text>Peoria Heights is a village lying in Peoria County in the U.S. state of Illinois. The population was 6,156 at the 2010 census, down from 6,635 in 2000. Peoria Heights is a suburb of Peoria, is sometimes referred to as Uptown, and is surrounded by the city except for its eastern boundary on Peoria Lake, a relatively wider section of the Illinois River. It is part of the Peoria, Illinois Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
According to the 2010 census, Peoria Heights has a total area of , of which (or 38.03%) is land and (or 61.97%) is water. That most of the village is water is due to the fact that most of Upper Peoria Lake lies within its boundaries; this can be seen on official state maps.

Topographically, the village can be roughly divided into three zones. The Illinois River floodplain, the bluff, and the plateau. While its eastern border is fairly regular with the river&#x27;s edge, the rest of its municipal border, with Peoria, is quite irregular and convoluted.

According to the Census Bureau records through 2007, Peoria Heights lies in three counties (Peoria, Woodford, and Tazewell). While neither Tazewell nor Woodford counties consider Peoria Heights to be within their jurisdiction, the state of Illinois does show that across Peoria Lake from the rest of the village, a small, uninhabited area exists both within Peoria Heights and Woodford County. However, the Census Bureau claim that Peoria Heights is also within Tazewell County is unsupported by any state, county, or municipal websites.

==History==
The area was developed by white settlers in 1898, under the name Prospect Heights Land Company. When it was incorporated, it was called Prospect Heights. Three years later, they changed it to Peoria Heights to avoid confusion with the Prospect Heights community near Chicago.

The Prospect Heights Hotel hosted a Hungarian orchestra that played every night as the house band. The hotel burned down in the summer of 1894.

The village celebrated its centennial in 1998.

==Landmarks==
The village is perhaps most noteworthy for its Grand View Drive, a residential street on top of the bluff overlooking the Illinois River with many elegant homes and a country club. The road also has several panoramic look-outs of the river and beyond into Tazewell and Woodford counties as well as a park with a children&#x27;s playground, picnic area, and baseball diamond. Teddy Roosevelt purportedly called the street the &quot;World&#x27;s Most Beautiful Drive&quot; when he visited the Peoria area in October 1910; WMBD, a local radio and TV station, gets its call letters from Roosevelt&#x27;s expression.

The town is also recognized by its distinct, red water tower. One can ascend the tower in an elevator and survey a sizable portion of Peoria, Tazewell, and Woodford counties from three observational decks. The tower has a 6 ft. wooden woodpecker on the side. The tower forms the nucleus of Peoria Heights Tower Park. Tower Park is a centerpiece of the community which underwent sweeping and controversial renovations in 2002, costing the Village nearly $800,000. The nearby downtown business area includes upscale restaurants and shops. In addition to this water tower there is another modern tower on Toledo Avenue colored white with the Peoria Heights logo; it was formerly painted a distinctive Red, White, and Blue (the school district colors).

A bronze sculpture of Lincoln&#x27;s head by Gutzon Borglum is near the Village Hall within Tower Park.

On and below the bluff, there are several parks and recreational areas. Forest Park Nature Center is a nature reserve on the bluff containing several miles of trails of varying difficulty and the village&#x27;s only native prairie restoration site. The Pimiteoui Trail links up Forest Park Nature Center&#x27;s visitor center with Grandview Drive. Bielfeldt Park is a more traditional park with sports fields, a paved trail, children&#x27;s playground, and picnic area. The southern terminus of Grandview also sports a park with swings, slide, and pavilion. The Rock Island Greenway has a section through Peoria Heights.

The Duryea Motor Wagon Company once had a production facility nearby (the reason for the aforementioned visit by Teddy Roosevelt). The town was also the site of a brewery for Pabst Blue Ribbon from 1934 to 1982. The closing of the Pabst brewery in 1982 had a severe impact on the local economy and population, from which the community has never completely recovered. The Peoria City mass transit company, CityLink, offers a History Trolley, which starts its tour in the Prospect Commercial Sector.

The Peoria Heights Public Library is located off Glen and is not far from Grandview Drive or Downtown Peoria Heights.

==Government and politics==
The Village of Peoria Heights is a home rule municipality governed by a Village Board of Trustees form of government. The mayor and the village clerk are each elected at large to a four-year term. The Mayor appoints the Village Treasurer. The Mayor is the Chief Executive Officer of the Village and presides over meetings of the Village Board. With the approval of the Village Board, the Mayor appoints non-elected Village officials. The Village Clerk is the recording officer of the Village, and is responsible for attending all meetings of the Village Board and keeping records of the proceedings. Village Board meetings are the first and third Tuesday of each month.

The Village Board is the legislative body for the village, and consists of six trustees elected for a four-year term. Their terms are staggered, so that half are elected every two years. Members may be elected for an indefinite number of terms. The Village Board formulates policy and enacts local laws, usually in the form of resolutions and ordinances. The Village Board is directly responsible to the citizens of Peoria Heights.

Peoria Heights has a history of non-national political parties. The &quot;Village Party&quot; and the &quot;People&#x27;s Party&quot; were once prominent in local elections. Today the &quot;Village Party&quot; is defunct and the &quot;People&#x27;s Party&quot; has lost in the last four elections to Independent candidates.

==Emergency Services==
Peoria Heights has stand alone Fire and Police Services. The fire department is a volunteer on call service. As of December 2014, EMS services are provided by Advanced Medical Transport.

== History ==
Perry County was formed on January 29, 1827. It was named for Commodore Oliver H. Perry. When Perry County was established, 80 acres were taken from nearby Jackson and Randolph counties; 20 acres were reserved for the county seat. On May 17, 1857, Pinckneyville (named after Charles Cotesworth Pinckney) was organized and named as the county seat. Before being organized, Pinckneyville consisted as of 1834 of a log courthouse, four stores, a tavern, and a grocery (the first store was opened in 1827); around 20 families lived in the town. 1834 was also the same year that the Perry County jail was constructed; a larger jail, which is now the home of the Perry County jail museum, was built in 1871.

During the American Civil War (1861–1865), southern Illinois was under martial law. In the years after Reconstruction, many laws were established to ensure the second-class status of African Americans. Many actions, however, were &quot;de facto&quot; laws. From 1890 to 1968, many sundown towns were established throughout the United States, including several in southern Illinois. Pinckneyville, on the other hand, was one amongst thousands of towns that, while established earlier, became a sundown town. Pinckneyville became sundown around 1928; the extant story in Pinckneyville is that a white woman was raped by a black man, so the white leadership of the town loaded the black population of the town on a bus, drove them out of town, and left them in East St. Louis; a black man, probably the alleged rapist, was lynched at the town square. However, the rape explanation is considered to be unreliable because of the vagueness of the story and because it conflicts with accounts offered by others who lived in Pinckneyville at the time. The town continued to be a sundown town; the town had a &quot;hanging tree&quot;, though African Americans were hanged in at least three separate places; under the city limits sign, there was a sign saying &quot;No Coloreds After Dark&quot; that came down in the late 1960s or early 1970s. In the town cemetery&#x27;s black section, there are only two grave markers, yet it is estimated that there are approximately twenty graves.

As of the 2000 United States census, 1,331 of the 5,464 residents were black, however this population total includes the inmates of Pinckneyville Correctional Center, who are mostly African-American.

Today, Pinckneyville is home to the Illinois Rural Heritage museum. In 2010, it was awarded the Governor&#x27;s Hometown Award.

==Education==
Elementary schools in Pinckneyville include District #50, CCSD 204, and St. Bruno Catholic School. Tamaroa grade school also feeds into the high school.

Pinckneyville Community High School is the only high school serving the Pinckneyville area. The mascot is the panther. School colors are Columbia, Navy, and White. PCHS has longtime rivalries with DuQuoin High School and Nashville Community High School.

Pinckneyville is known for its boys basketball program, winning over 2,000 games and appearing in the State Finals Tournament 11 times (winning in 1948, 1994 and 2001).

The town was platted by Sheridan Wait and Henry Durfee. &quot;Cerro Gordo&quot; Williams was one of the citizens, and as the town had other citizens who fought in the battle of Cerro Gordo, they selected the name Cerro Gordo. When the Civil War erupted, &quot;Cerro Gordo&quot; Williams returned to Kentucky and became a general in the Army of the Confederacy. On May 31, 1864, his residence was destroyed by fire, with arson being suspected.

<text>Monticello ( ) is a city and county seat of Piatt County, Illinois, United States. The population was 5,941 at the 2020 census.

== Geography ==
According to the 2010 census, Monticello has a total area of , of which (or 99.24%) is land and (or 0.76%) is water.

Monticello is located in East Central Illinois between the cities of Decatur and Champaign, Illinois.

== Landmarks ==
Robert Allerton Park, which belongs to the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign and includes 1,500 acres of woodland and prairie areas, a meadow, a conference and retreat center, formal sculpture gardens, hiking trails, lodging facilities, a summer camp location, and a Georgian style mansion, is located just outside Monticello, to the southwest. The Allerton Natural Area within the park was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1970.

Monticello Railway Museum is located on the north side of Monticello. The Monticello Railway Museum is a non-profit operating railroad that offers train rides to the public from May to October.

== History ==

Monticello&#x27;s first non-native resident was George Hayworth. Hayworth came to the area in 1822 to serve as a U.S. liaison agent to local Native American tribes. Hayworth did not remain, but in 1829, James A. Piatt purchased Hayworth&#x27;s small log cabin. Soon more settlers arrived.

In 1837, residents decided to form a new town. Abraham Marquiss, William Barnes, James McReynolds, and James A. Piatt Jr. formed a joint stock company and purchased land from James A. Piatt. Upon McReynolds&#x27; suggestion, the town was christened Monticello – after the home of Thomas Jefferson. Monticello officially became a town on July 1, 1837. Townsfolk held a celebration on July 4.

The first house in the new town was built by a Mr. Cass who used the building as his home and a grocery store. The second house was a log cabin built by John Tenbrooke. In 1839, Nicholas DeVore built the &quot;Old Fort&quot; which was later used as a hotel. Monticello continued to grow as the population increased over the next decade.

George Patterson and other prominent citizens of the area were unhappy with the travel distance to the county seat to conduct legal business, and petitioned to establish a new county. At the time, Monticello was part of Macon County, whose seat is in Decatur, nearly 30 miles away. The northern part of present-day Piatt County was part of DeWitt County whose seat is at Clinton. The Illinois General Assembly established a new county on January 27, 1841. By coin toss, the county was named Piatt County, in honor of the first permanent settler, James A. Piatt. As Monticello was the only town in the new county at the time, it was named the county seat. The government of the new county began conducting business on April 5, 1841 in the &quot;Old Fort.&quot; In 1843, the first courthouse was built on land donated by William H. Piatt. The second courthouse was built in 1856, and the present courthouse was completed in 1904.

Monticello&#x27;s star resident arrived in 1885. Dr. William B. Caldwell came to practice medicine in Monticello but his homemade mixture of senna and pepsin brought Monticello to a level of national prominence. The Pepsin Syrup Company was founded in 1893, and became the leading employer in the city for decades until its closure in 1985. The building in which it operated has since been demolished. The site is now used as an unofficial soccer practice field.
In 1987 the 150th birthday of the town was celebrated with an open air reenactment and other festivities.

The Potawatomi Trail of Death passed through the town in 1838.

In a 2012 episode of the Comedy Central program &quot;The Daily Show&quot;, host Jon Stewart used the town in a joke segment, referring to it as Dogshit Bluffs.

===Purple martins===

Griggsville is located between the Mississippi River and the Illinois River and the hot muggy summers are the perfect habitat for mosquitoes. Amid growing concern over the use of pesticides to control mosquitoes, the town came up with an alternate abatement method. J.L. Wade, a Griggsville resident and owner of a local antenna manufacturing factory realized that Griggsville was right in the migration path of the purple martin, the largest bird in the swallow family, supposedly able to eat 2,000 mosquitoes in a single day. J.L. Wade quickly realized that to get the purple martins to stay, he simply needed to give them a reason to stay, so he converted his antenna factory into a bird house building factory. The mosquito population dwindled, which lead the town to adopt the nickname &quot;The Purple Martin Capital of the Nation&quot;, as well as labeling the purple martin &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted Bird.&quot; Additionally, Wade&#x27;s purple martin business, formerly Trio Manufacturing, published a newsletter called &quot;The Nature Society News&quot;. The purple martin factory has been recently sold to a Chicago businessman. Griggsville has installed over 5,000 birdhouses along the city streets, including a 562-apartment high rise installed in 1962, reaching a height of 70 ft.

<text>Pittsfield is a city in and the county seat of Pike County, Illinois, United States. The population was 4,576 at the 2010 census, an increase from 4,211 in 2000.

==History==

Pittsfield was initially settled by settlers from New England. These settlers were of old Yankee stock, descended from the English Puritans who had founded and settled New England in the 1600s. A group of settlers from Pittsfield, Massachusetts headed west and settled this region of Illinois in 1820. When they arrived the area was a virgin wilderness, they constructed farms, roads and government buildings.

As county seat, the town was one of the various places in central Illinois where Abraham Lincoln practiced law as part of the circuit court, working on 34 cases between 1839 and 1852. One local newspaper, now known as the &quot;Pike Press&quot;, was then owned by another of Lincoln&#x27;s future secretaries, John Nicolay, and featured an editorial containing one of the first known suggestions of Lincoln as the Republican nominee for the presidency. Pittsfield was also home to John Hay, Lincoln&#x27;s personal secretary, ambassador to England under President William McKinley, later Secretary of State for Theodore Roosevelt and creator of the Open Door Policy.

Pittsfield is the self-proclaimed &quot;Pork Capital&quot; of the Midwest, owing to the long history of pork production in the region, which fed into the large meat-packing industry of Chicago. Though agriculture in the region is no longer so dependent on pork, the town still hosts a yearly &quot;Pig Days&quot; festival.

The local high school football team, the Saukees, still holds the record for longest winning streak in the state, and the 21st longest in the country. Starting with their season opening 6–0 win over North Greene in 1966, the Pittsfield Saukees reeled off 64 consecutive wins, which included 15 straight shutouts between 1969 and 1971. In 1970, the team outscored their opponents 341-0 and allowed negative rushing yards for the season. The streak extended all the way through to the second game of the 1973 season, when Pittsfield dropped a 12-0 decision to Winchester, Illinois.

Pittsfield&#x27;s Saukees basketball team won the Illinois State basketball title in 1991 under Coach David T. Bennett, who was later installed into the Illinois Basketball Hall of Fame. Exactly 20 years later in 2011, the Saukees would return to the Illinois State basketball court and take home the 4th place title under Coach Brad Tomhave.

Pittsfield is the setting for Jamie Gilson&#x27;s book &quot;Hello, My Name is Scrambled Eggs&quot;. Singer/songwriter Sufjan Stevens wrote a song about Pittsfield on his album &quot;The Avalanche&quot;.

==Landmarks==

Pittsfield is home to the most locations in the world that have documented connections to Abraham Lincoln. There are nine homes still in existence in Pittsfield that are connected to Lincoln, including the Shastid House, where Lincoln often stayed while practicing cases in the county. His personally signed documents have been stolen from the courthouse.  Many people in the county have seen them and know they exist.  The public is alerted to watch for them, should they surface at sales, in museums, or private collections.  The dockets listing Lincoln&#x27;s cases still remain, stored in ancient records in the courthouse basement.

There are many historic landmarks within the city limits, the most notable of which is the Pike County Courthouse. The courthouse was designed by Architect Henry Elliott of Chicago and Jacksonville. Contractors were Yeager and Schultz of Danville, Illinois. The courthouse was to be completed within 400 days after the signing of the contract at a cost of $45,000. Groundbreaking for the courthouse was on May 11, 1894. The cornerstone was laid on July 12, 1894, and the dedication of the new courthouse was on November 16, 1895. Robert Franklin, a master mason from Nebo, Illinois designed and supervised the keystone architecture of the courthouse. It was the third courthouse in Pittsfield and the fifth in Pike County. The building is of octagon shape 96 x 96 feet of Cleveland sandstone veneering, backed by heavy walls of brick; the dimensions over all, is over the steps and porches, is 119 feet by 119 feet. Four entrances, all exactly alike, face the four cardinal points – north, south, east, and west.

The entrances are large, double doors of oak and glass and are overhung with beautiful stone porches. The park in which the building stands is 340 feet square. There are four sidewalks leading up to the doors of the courthouse and a sidewalk circles the building. From the center of the building rise the graceful outlines of the tower and dome to an imposing height of 136 feet. The corridors, which cross under the dome are ten feet in width, with marbled tiled floors, wainscoting and frescoed ceilings. Standing on the lower floor in the center of the corridor under the dome and looking upward, one may observe a beautiful concave of colored lights which spans the vault of the rotunda at a point near the top of the main building. The dome roof is of red slate. Total cost of building and fixtures was $68,520. The Pike County Illinois Courthouse is widely recognized as one of the most beautiful courthouses in the state and the Midwest. The Pike County Illinois courthouse was the fifth courthouse designed by Mr Elliott who also designed the Greene County Courthouse (1891) in Carrollton, Illinois; Edgar County Courthouse (1891) in Paris, Illinois; Jersey County Courthouse (1893) in Jerseyville, Illinois; and DeWitt County Illinois Courthouse (1893) in Clinton, Illinois. The DeWitt County Courthouse was demolished in 1987.

The East Ward School, built between 1861 and 1866, was designed by Architect John M. Van Osdel, who also designed the Palmer House in Chicago, as well as the Governor&#x27;s Mansion in Springfield. John Houston of Griggsville built the school for the contract price of $35,000, which was financed by bonding. The building is stone (boated from Joliet on the Illinois river) and brick burned in Pittsfield. Both the grade school and high school were located in this building. At the completion of the East School in 1866, it was one of the finest and largest buildings of its kind in the state and &quot;fulfilled the requirements of a modern school plant.&quot; Original blackboards were simply black paint on the plastered walls. Generally, they were completely around the room, including between the windows. The original building was heated by hot air piped from furnaces in the basement. There were no inside toilet facilities, but there were outside &quot;privies&quot; located east of the building next to the street. Presently, restrooms are in the basement, through the side doors near the front. Its large clock and bell were donated by Colonel Ross and mounted in the tower. The Clock Tower is one of the few tower clocks in its original state left in the United States. The school closed in 1955 and was unoccupied until 1978 when it was renovated and became the home of the Pike County Historical Society and the Pike County Historic Museum.

The William Watson hotel was built in 1838, and called Mansion House, by William Watson, who was the first settler of Pittsfield. The original hotel is said to have been a frequent stop for Abraham Lincoln and many of his contemporaries.

==Geography==
Pittsfield is on U.S. Route 54 between the Mississippi River approximately eight miles to the southwest and the Illinois River approximately eight miles to the east. Bay Creek flows past just north and east of the city.

According to the 2010 census, Pittsfield has a total area of , of which (or 92.19%) is land and (or 7.81%) is water.

Pittsfield&#x27;s drinking water supply is provided by Lake Pittsfield, an artificial reservoir held in by an earth and concrete dam. The lake is located within a park that has become a prime recreational area offering boating, fishing, RV and primitive camping, hiking, disc golf, and other outdoor activities.

Pittsfield, along with the bulk of Pike County, is located in the land between the Illinois and Mississippi rivers as they move toward convergence in St. Louis. The land is riddled with streams and bottom lands mostly draining through the McGee Creek drainage basin into the Illinois River. Thus, the land around Pittsfield and Pike County is much more hilly and forested than the rest of the plains of central Illinois. This geography, combined with a relative lack of heavy development, make the areas around Pittsfield particularly suited to wildlife. Pittsfield regularly attracts large numbers of out-of-state game hunters, and Pike county consistently leads all other Illinois counties in the number of deer harvested during fall hunting seasons.

==History==
Time is a village in the Midwestern United States, in the West Central region of Illinois. It was established as a village in 1857 in Hardin Township, which was then located in Pike County, Illinois. The slogan for the village, created in 1910, is &quot;Time marches on 1857-2007.&quot; It thrived during the 20th century but later met a decline. For an extended period of time, the Dyer family was very prominent. This family is the ancestors of the Pittsfield resident Richard Dyer.

When the censuses began in 1880, there were roughly 120 members of the community. There were also 4 stores, 2 wagons, a blacksmith shop, and a flouring mill. The popularity of the community has slowly declined and in the 2010 census, there were only 22 community members. They reside under a village president. The current village president is Joe Chiatello.

The town was a religious outlet for members of the surrounding community. It originally contained a Methodist and Christian church. This was later reduced to the current Time community church under the leadership of pastor Musgrove.

One of the prized possessions of the township is the bandstand which is located on the square next to the shelter house. The bandstand was established around the years of 1906 and 1907. This housed the concerts of the brass band that was famous around the county in the 19th and 20th century. It also had a string band in 1867. Time was also known for its revolutionary invention of the granitoid sidewalk.

As for the schooling, there was a two room brick schoolhouse. This school still resides on the east side of the village and is no longer in use. It has been vacant since 1950. It is just west of the cemetery. The village is also known for its croquet course. It was found in the square, alongside the bandstand. This sport was available to the residents until 1910.

<text>Golconda is a city in and the county seat of Pope County, Illinois, United States, located along the Ohio River. The population was 630 at the 2020 census. Most of the city is part of the Golconda Historic District.

==History==
The city is named after Golconda in Hyderabad, India, famed in the 19th century for its diamond mines. Golconda was the first permanent settlement in Pope County in 1798, and a ferry point across the Ohio River that was sometimes called Lusk&#x27;s Ferry was established around that time. The town was named Sarahsville upon the organization of Pope County in 1816, but changed its name to Golconda on January 24, 1817, after the ancient city of Golkonda in India. In 1840, the Buel House, a single-family home presently-owned by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency, was built. Among the many historic buildings built in the latter half of the 19th century is the First Presbyterian Church (built in 1869). It is the oldest continuous Presbyterian congregation in Illinois. The church was organized in 1819.

===Trail of Tears===
Some 13,000 Cherokees, led by Chief Bear Paw crossed the Ohio River at Golconda by ferry as part of the infamous &quot;Trail of Tears&quot; to Oklahoma. Because of the threat of disease, the Native Americans were not allowed to go into any towns or villages along the way; often this meant traveling much farther to go around them. After crossing Tennessee and Kentucky, they arrived at the Ohio River across from Golconda about the 3rd of December 1838. The starving Indians were charged a dollar a head (equal to $ today) to cross the river on &quot;Carpenter&#x27;s Ferry&quot;, which typically charged twelve cents ($ today). They were not allowed passage until the ferry had serviced all others wishing to cross and were forced to take shelter under &quot;Mantle Rock&quot;, a bluff on the Kentucky side, until &quot;Mr. Carpenter had nothing better to do&quot;. Many died huddled together at Mantle Rock waiting to cross. Several Cherokee were also murdered by locals. Many of the Cherokee were rescued and sheltered by the Carpenter family, one of the founding leaders of Golconda. The killers filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Government through the courthouse in Vienna, suing the government for $35 a head (equal to $ today) to bury the murdered Cherokee.

<text>Mound City is a city and the county seat of Pulaski County, Illinois, United States. It is located along the Ohio River just north of its confluence with the Mississippi River. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 588.

==History==
Mound City was incorporated in 1857 as a union of two cities: Mound City, founded by Major General Moses Marshal Rawlings, and Emporium City, a project of the Emporium Real Estate and Manufacturing Company, a group of Cincinnati and Cairo businessmen. The city took its name from a Native American mound on which guests at General Rawlings&#x27; hotel would sleep in summer, as the breezes cooled them and dispersed the mosquitoes.

During the Civil War, Admiral Andrew Hull Foote made Cairo the naval station for the Mississippi River Squadron of over 200 ironclads, timberclads, hospital ships, transports, and other vessels. Since Cairo had no land available for base facilities, the navy yard repair shop machinery was afloat aboard wharf-boats, old steamers, tugs, flat-boats, and rafts. The naval station was moved upstream in 1862 when of land was purchased in Mound City. The Mound City Naval Station included a shipyard with marine ways, a foundry, marine barracks, supply offices, and a hospital; but many repair facilities remained afloat because the Mound City land was frequently inundated by flood waters.

USS &quot;Cairo&quot; was built in 1861 by James Eads and Co. of Mound City, under contract to the War Department. She was commissioned in January 1862 as part of the Mississippi River Squadron, U.S. Navy Lieutenant James M. Prichett in command. She was a City-class ironclad gunboat constructed for the Union Navy during the American Civil War. She was the lead ship of the City-class gunboats, sometimes also called the &quot;Cairo&quot; class, and was named for Cairo, Illinois. On December 12, 1862 just north of Vicksburg, Mississippi, the USS &quot;Cairo&quot; became the first ship sunk by electrically detonated torpedoes during its mission to destroy Confederate batteries and clear the Yazoo River of underwater mines.

In 2017, Mound City elected Allison Madison, the city&#x27;s first African-American and first female mayor.

==Geography==
Mound City is located at (37.085624, -89.163054).

According to the 2010 census, Mound City has a total area of , of which (or 91.91%) is land and (or 8.09%) is water.

==Industry==
Hennepin&#x27;s location on the Illinois River, along with its proximity to a Class I railroad (Norfolk Southern Railway), and multiple inter and intrastate highway routes (Interstate 80, Interstate 39, Illinois Route 180, Illinois Route 89, Illinois Route 71, Illinois Route 26, and Illinois Route 6) has, historically, made it a transportation hub attracting a variety of both small businesses and large industries.

J&amp;L Steel, a cold roll steel mill built by Jones and Laughlin Steel Company on Hennepin&#x27;s northern boundary, began operations in 1967 and employed 600 workers at height of production. The mill was later acquired by Ling-Temco-Vought, at which time it became known as LTV Steel. Ling-Temco-Vought&#x27;s bankruptcy led to acquisition of the mill by International Steel Group (ISG). As a result of additional acquisitions followed by a merger, Putnam County&#x27;s largest employer was absorbed by ArcelorMittal. Long and arduous union lobbying and protests ultimately proved futile and ArcelorMittal ceased production at the mill in March 2009. The mill&#x27;s equipment was dismantled, sold, or shipped and on June 22, 2017, the vast plant was imploded. As of 2020, the 800 acres once occupied by the steel mill remain mostly vacant, though infrastructure has been retained in anticipation that another industry might one day purchase and redevelop the property.

Hennepin Power Station, a coal-fired power plant near Donnelley Wildlife Area on the western edge of town, was retired November 1, 2019.

There are also Cargill, ADM, and CGB elevators throughout the area.

Marquis Energy opened a 100 million gallon/year ICM/Fagen ethanol plant just north of town in April 2008.

<text>Chester is a city in and the county seat of Randolph County, Illinois, United States, on a bluff above the Mississippi River. The population was 7,640 at the 2020 census. It lies south of St. Louis, Missouri.

==History==
===Founding===
Samuel Smith is said to be the town&#x27;s founder because he built the first home in Chester, established a ferry system, and began the construction of a mill in 1829. The town was named after Chester, England, the city from where his wife Jane Smith was from. The first business in Chester was a general store that opened in 1830 along with a castor oil press established by R. B. Servant, who furnished farmers with seed and growing methods to later buy the beans they produced for oil extraction. This was a flourishing business until the petroleum industry made it obsolete.
The first wedding in the town of Chester was held on February 4, 1834. Content Walker, the bride and Amzi Andrews, the groom held their wedding in a 16 feet square log cabin.

===Cole Milling Company===
The H.C. Cole Milling Company was founded by Nathan Cole in 1839. It started out as a small sawmill with a corn-grinding attachment which encouraged the townspeople to plant grains, and in a short time the first Cole flour mill was built. The mill still exists in Chester but it is now operated by Ardent Mills. Nathan Cole also brought the first electric generator to Chester and used the surplus of power from the mill to operate street lights. This was a modern convenience that was not even available in Chicago at that point. The generator is now on display at the Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan.

===International Shoe Company===
In 1916, Messrs. Bronson, Albert Gilster, Frank Wolff and John Herschbach developed the site for the International Shoe Company in the center of town where the Gilster Mary Lee Corp. is today. In 1922, a second building was built, and the company had more than 1000 employees and was producing thousands of pairs of children&#x27;s shoes. During World War Two, the factory operated primarily by women produced military/combat boots for the troops in service. In 1953, payroll reached over $2,000,000. The factory was closed by the company in the early 1960s after 45 years of operation.

===Prim Hosiery Mill===
In 1925, the Prim Hosiery Mill was a knitting mill that began operations under Joshua Richman with 50 employees. The mill grew to employ more than 275 people and produced over 300,000 pairs of stockings a month with annual payroll exceeding $700,000. The knitting mill continued operations through the 1960s. The building still stands as one of the Gilster Mary Lee Corp. factory buildings.

===Chester Pool===
Construction began for the Chester Pool in 1939 as part of a Works Progress Administration (WPA) public works program to create employment during the Great Depression. It was completed in 1941, although due to the delivery of the filtration system being delayed it did not officially open until May 30, 1942, under the management of William Weber. A total of 250 swimmers visited the swimming pool in the first week and were charged 15 cents for weekdays and 25 cents for weekends.

Due to leaks and other deterioration issues, as well as high repair costs, the pool has been closed since 2014.

==Home of &quot;Popeye&quot;==
Chester is the &quot;Home of Popeye,&quot; where a , bronze statue of Popeye the Sailor Man stands in the Elzie C. Segar Memorial Park, which honors Popeye&#x27;s creator, Elzie Segar. The park is located next to the Chester Bridge. Several of Segar&#x27;s characters were created from his experiences with people of Chester. Chester&#x27;s big event is its annual Popeye Picnic and parade, held the weekend after Labor Day. Popeye fans travel from all over the United States and the world to partake in the weekend activities. Most of the events and entertainment are free and all are family friendly.

New statues honoring the other Thimble Theater characters are added each year.

===Popeye&#x27;s Picnic and Parade===
Popeye&#x27;s Picnic is an event held in Chester the Friday, Saturday and Sunday following Labor Day in the month of September. Popeye&#x27;s Picnic consists of rides, food stands, music, and fireworks. The Popeye Parade is held on a Saturday morning. Before the parade there is a walk and run for anyone who wants to participate. Medals and trophies are awarded to the top runners and walkers in each age category. A Popeye T-shirt is included with each entry. Many people from different towns participate in this parade. The parade consists of local school bands, band fronts, such as dance teams and cheerleaders, floats from various businesses, fire departments, veterans representing the United States, politicians marching, clowns passing out stickers and candy, and finally horses trail the parade.
Many people and businesses help sponsor the picnic and donate money and time.

The Chester post office contains a federally commissioned mural, &quot;Loading the Packet&quot;, painted by Fay E.

<text>Kaskaskia is a village in Randolph County, Illinois. Having been inhabited by indigenous peoples, it was settled by France as part of the Illinois Country. It was named for the Kaskaskia people. Its population peaked at about 7,000 in the 18th century, when it was a regional center. During the American Revolutionary War, the town, which by then had become an administrative center for the British Province of Quebec, was taken by the Virginia militia during the Illinois campaign. It was designated as the county seat of Illinois County, Virginia, after which it became part of the Northwest Territory in 1787. Kaskaskia was later named as the capital of the United States&#x27; Illinois Territory, created on February 3, 1809. In 1818, when Illinois became the 21st U.S. state, the town briefly served as the state&#x27;s first capital until 1819, when the capital was moved to more centrally located Vandalia.
Most of the town was destroyed in April 1881 by flooding, as the Mississippi River shifted eastward to a new channel, taking over the lower of the Kaskaskia River. This resulted from deforestation of the river banks during the 19th century, due to crews taking wood for fuel to feed the steamboat and railroad traffic. The river now passes east rather than west of the town. The state boundary line, however, remained in its original location. A small bridge crosses the old riverbed, now a creek that is sometimes filled with water during flood season.

In the 2020 United States Census the population was 21, making it the third-least populous incorporated community in Illinois behind Valley City (pop. 14) and Florence (pop. 17). Kaskaskia has an Illinois telephone area code (618) and a Missouri ZIP Code (63673). Its roads are maintained by Illinois Department of Transportation, and its few residents vote in Illinois elections. The town was evacuated in the Great Flood of 1993, which covered it with water more than deep.

==History==
The site of Kaskaskia near the Mississippi River was long inhabited by varying Native American indigenous peoples for thousands of years. The Kaskaskia, part of the Illiniwek peoples, colonized this area in the 1600s, and lived there at the time of European encounter and traded with the early French colonists. Historically this name was referred to with many spelling variations, as Kasklas, Kaskasky, Cas-caskias, Kasquskias, and Kaskaskias. 

During the Beaver Wars, Kaskaskia grew as people sought common defense against Iroquois raids. The numbers swelled to around twenty thousand people by the 1680s. Kaskaskia aligned with the French to aid in defense against the Iroquois. The French also gave them trade goods, which Kaskaskia merchants used to trade with nations too far South or West for French traders to reach. Kaskaskia became heavily involved in the slave trade, capturing and selling people from neighboring nations.

By the 1690s, Kaskaskia was in decline. This was in part due to an epidemic that hit the large town particularly hard. By this time, it had also become harder to obtain sources of wood and bison near Kaskaskia. The Great Peace of Montreal in 1701, which ended the Beaver Wars, also reduced the need for mutual defense.

===French settlement===
In 1703, French Jesuit missionaries established a mission with the goal of converting the Native Americans to Catholicism. The congregation built its first stone church in 1714. The French also had a fur trading post in the village. Canadien settlers moved in to farm and to exploit the lead mines on the opposite side of the river (now in Missouri).
Favorably situated on a peninsula on the east side of the Mississippi River, Kaskaskia became a large settlement center attracting a large proportion of the region&#x27;s Native American population. It became the capital of Upper Louisiana and the French built Fort de Chartres nearby in 1718. In the same year they imported the first enslaved Africans, shipped from Santo Domingo in the Caribbean, to work as laborers in the lead mines.

In the years of early French settlement, Kaskaskia was a multicultural village, consisting of a few French men and numerous Illinois and other American Indians. In 1707, the population of the community was estimated at 2,200, the majority of them Illinois who lived somewhat apart from the Europeans. Writing of Kaskaskia about 1715, a visitor said that the village consisted of 400 Illinois men, &quot;good people&quot;; two Jesuit missionaries, and &quot;about twenty French voyageurs who have settled there and married Indian women.&quot; Of 21 children whose birth and baptism was recorded in Kaskaskia before 1714, 18 had mothers who were Indian and 20 had fathers who were French. One devout Catholic, full-blooded Indian woman disowned her mixed-race son for living &quot;among the savage nations&quot;.

Many of the Canadiens and their descendants at Kaskaskia became voyageurs and coureurs des bois, who would explore and exploit the Missouri River country for fur trading. The Canadiens had the goal of trading with all the Prairie tribes, and beyond them, with the Spanish colony in New Mexico. The Spanish intended to keep control of the latter trade. The Canadien goals stimulated the expedition of Claude Charles Du Tisne to establish trade relations with the Plains Indians in 1719.
King Louis XV sent a bell to Kaskaskia in 1741 for its church, one of several constructed there. During the years of French rule, Kaskaskia and the other agricultural settlements in the Illinois Country were critical for supplying Lower Louisiana, especially New Orleans, with wheat and corn, as these staple crops could not be grown in the Gulf climate. Farmers shipped tons of flour south over the years, which helped New Orleans survive.

The French settlers raised Fort Kaskaskia around 1759; the fort stood atop the bluff that overlooked the frontier village.[1] &quot;Fort Kaskaskia&quot; is not technically a &quot;fort&quot;, but an earthen redoubt. Frontier settlers throughout Woodland North America often built such redoubts for defense during times of threat from Native Americans.

In 1763, the French ceded the Illinois country, including Kaskaskia and the redoubt, to Great Britain after being defeated in the Seven Years&#x27; War (known as the French and Indian War on the North American front). The British did not use the redoubt but from 1766 through 1772, maintained a rotating detachment of around 25 men under a junior officer, from Fort de Chartres. They used the Jesuit compound as their base.

Rather than live under British rule after France ceded the territory east of the river, many French-speaking people from Kaskaskia and other colonial towns moved west of the Mississippi to Ste. Genevieve, St. Louis, and other areas. In May 1772, when the British abandoned Fort de Chartres, Kaskaskia continued to survive as a primarily French-speaking village on the Mississippi River frontier.

===American settlement===
During one of the westernmost military campaigns of the American Revolution, the city fell on July 4, 1778, to George Rogers Clark and his force of 200 men, including Captains Joseph Bowman and Leonard Helm. The parish rang the church bell in celebration, and it has since been called the &quot;liberty bell&quot;. The brick church, built in 1843 in the squared-off French style, was later moved to the restored village of Kaskaskia on the west side of the Mississippi.

In 1803, the Kaskaskia people, for whom the town is named, signed a treaty with the United States of America, arranged by future president William Henry Harrison, who was at that time governor of the Indiana territory, and Kaskaskia chief Jean Baptiste Ducoigne. Ducoigne was of mixed descent, noted for being friendly with the United States and being hated by other tribal chiefs. The treaty specifically provides for a house on a lot of &quot;no more than one hundred acres&quot; for Jean Baptiste Ducoigne and that a &quot;suitable sum&quot; of all material and monetary payments to the tribe would be reserved for the chief and his family. This treaty was said to &quot;rightfully represent&quot; not only the Kaskaskia tribe but also the Cahokia, Mitchigamia, and Tamarois, though the signatures for those tribes were not made by chiefs and were marked only with &#x27;X&#x27; and a notation of the individual&#x27;s name, one of which was noted as &quot;Micolas or Nicolas&quot;.

In exchange for ceding a tract of land comprising approximately half the area of modern-day Illinois, the Kaskaskia and associated tribes were allotted three hundred fifty acres &quot;near the town of Kaskaskia&quot;, as well as the right to relocate to another larger settlement within the ceded territory.

As a center of the regional economy, Kaskaskia served as the capital of Illinois Territory from 1809 until statehood was gained in 1818, and then as the state capital until 1819. The first Illinois newspaper, the &quot;Illinois Herald&quot;, was published here on June 24, 1814. In 1818 it was the site of the state&#x27;s first constitutional convention and first legislative session.

The city&#x27;s peak population was about 7,000, before the capital was moved in 1819 to Vandalia. Although the introduction of steamboats on the Mississippi River stimulated the economies of river towns, in the 19th century, their use also had devastating environmental effects. Deforestation of the river banks followed steamboat crews&#x27; regular cutting of trees, which were used to feed the engine boiler fires as fuel to power the steamboats. Through this rapid, man-made erosion, river banks became unstable, resulting in massive amounts of soil to collapse into the flowing water.

In 1832, during the era of Indian removal, the Peoria tribe, speaking for Kaskaskia, Cahokia, Mitchigamia, and Tamarois, signed a second treaty. This treaty was arranged by Superintendent of Indian Affairs William Clark, who was at that same time a figurehead in the implementation of the Indian Removal Act, associated with the Trail of Tears further south. The treaty was signed two months after the end of the Black Hawk War in northwestern Illinois, between the Sauk tribe and the United States. The Sauk disputed the validity of a treaty similar to the Kaskaskia treaty of 1803, arranged by William Henry Harrison in 1804. The Sauk lost the Black Hawk War, resulting in the death of half of the Sauk forces. The Kaskaskia treaty of 1832 relinquished all lands reserved for the tribe in the 1803 treaty with the exception of 350 acres near the town of Kaskaskia, Illinois, reserved to Ellen Ducoigne, a daughter of Jean Baptiste Ducoigne who had married a white man. All other members of all five tribes mentioned in the treaty were relocated to Indian Country in modern-day Kansas.

===Effects of the Mississippi River===

From St. Louis to the confluence of the Ohio River, the Mississippi became wider and more shallow, resulting in more severe seasonal flooding. In the late 19th century, the town was cut off from the Illinois mainland and mostly destroyed by repeated flooding and a channel change by the Mississippi River. Much of the former property of Kaskaskia and other French colonial towns on the river has been lost. Following the Great Flood of 1844, residents of Kaskaskia relocated the town to the south. The original location of Kaskaskia became an island, surrounded by the Mississippi River. The flood of 1881 destroyed all remnants of the original town and the Mississippi shifted into the channel of the Kaskaskia River, passing east instead of west of the town.

Parts of the town were rebuilt in the new area. As the Mississippi continued to flow through its new bed, earth was deposited so that the village land became physically attached to the west bank of the river, which primarily lies within the boundaries of the state of Missouri. Now a bayou, the old channel is regularly flooded by the river. A small bridge carries traffic from the mainland over the bayou to Kaskaskia and its surrounding farmlands in the floodplain. A levee lines the river to the east. In 1893 the people of the town moved and rebuilt the Church of the Immaculate Conception at Kaskaskia. They also built a shrine in a similar style nearby to house the &quot;liberty bell&quot;.

By 1950, only 112 people lived in Kaskaskia. By 1970, the population had fallen to 79, and it continued to decline to 33 in 1980. The town was submerged under nine feet of water by the Great Flood of 1993, which reached the roofs of the buildings. By 2000, with nine residents, Kaskaskia was almost a ghost town, the least populous incorporated community in the state of Illinois.

<text>Prairie du Rocher (&quot;The Rock Prairie&quot; in French) is a village in Randolph County, Illinois, United States. Founded in the French colonial period in the American Midwest, the community is located near bluffs that flank the east side of the Mississippi River along the floodplain often called the &quot;American Bottom&quot;. The population was 502 at the 2020 census.

Prairie du Rocher is one of the oldest communities in the 21st century United States that was founded as a French settlement. About four miles to the west, closer to the Mississippi River, is Fort de Chartres, site of a French military fortification and colonial headquarters established in 1720. Some buildings were reconstructed after falling into ruin, and the complex is now a state park and historical site. The fort and town were a center of government and commerce at the time when France claimed a vast territory in North America, New France or &quot;La Louisiane&quot;, which stretched from present-day Louisiana and the Illinois Country to Canada.

The village was founded in 1722 by French colonists, mostly migrants from Canada.

==History==
===New France===
In 1718, Pierre Dugué de Boisbriand built the first Fort de Chartres. In 1722, St. Thérèse Langlois, a nephew of Boisbriand, founded Prairie du Rocher. The town was built on a tract of land donated by the Royal Indian Company. Boisbriand later became the commandant of the area. The town was strategically located along fertile Mississippi River bottomland. Surpluses from the productive cultivation by &quot;habitants&quot; later helped supply critical wheat and corn to New Orleans and other lower Louisiana Territory communities.

D&#x27;Artaguette, an inspector in the country in the early 18th century, wrote: 
This country is one of the most beautiful in all Louisiana. Every kind of grain and vegetables are produced here in the greatest abundance ... they have, also, large numbers of oxen, cows, sheep, etc., upon the prairies. Poultry is abundant, and fish plentiful. So that, in fact, they lack none of the necessaries or conveniences of life.

In 1743 the territorial government granted the Prairie du Rocher Common (land used by all the villagers) to the village; the common was used until 1852. The villagers had plots for cultivation defined in typical French fashion: long narrow lots that reached back from the riverfront through the common. The villagers kept the plots open within the common, and built a fence around it to keep out livestock. A school existed as early as the 1760s; students boarded with local families.

Because &quot;habitants&quot; did not practice fertilization, the soil became exhausted. In addition, an increase in population meant there was not sufficient land for everyone. Some villagers moved to the west side of the Mississippi and founded Ste. Genevieve about 1750, in present-day Missouri. They quickly created an agricultural community with characteristics similar to Prairie du Rocher.

===British rule===
Following their victory in the French and Indian War (also known as the Seven Years&#x27; War), the British gained possession of French lands east of the Mississippi, excluding New Orleans. The Treaty of Paris was signed in 1763; however, the British did not arrive in force until 1765. To avoid British rule, many of the town&#x27;s French residents moved across the Mississippi River to towns such as Ste. Genevieve and St. Louis in what was now, via the secret Treaty of Fontainebleau, Spanish Louisiana. Additionally, King George III&#x27;s Royal Proclamation of 1763 designated all the land west of the Appalachians and east of the Mississippi an Indian Reserve. He tried to prevent settlers entering from the then-British Colonies.

===American Revolution===
During the American Revolutionary War, George Rogers Clark captured Prairie du Rocher for the colonies in his Illinois campaign that also resulted in the capture of Vincennes, Indiana. Reportedly, his campaign caused some of the remaining French settlers to emigrate to the Spanish-controlled territories west of the Mississippi, leaving relatively few in Prairie du Rocher. Many of the subsequent settlers of the area had been members of Clark&#x27;s campaign, or were related to someone who was. They were convinced of the promise of the area by tales of the fertility of the soil in the area now called American Bottom.

===1993 floods===
Prairie du Rocher was one of the few towns along the Mississippi River that escaped being flooded in the Great Flood of 1993. After levees broke to the north near the towns of Columbia and Valmeyer, Illinois, flood waters engulfed Fort de Chartres. They also threatened the town of Prairie du Rocher.

With only the Prairie du Rocher Creek levee protecting the town, residents discovered a unique situation had developed. The water that had broken through the main Mississippi River levee and was approaching the top of the Prairie du Rocher Creek levee was higher than the water in the main Mississippi River channel. The Army Corps of Engineers (COE) decided to use a barge-mounted shovel to break through the Mississippi River levee near Fort de Chartres, to allow flood waters to escape back to the Mississippi River channel. This did not significantly lower the water level, but the COE decided against further action.

In a 3:30 a.m. decision, with the flood waters at the top of the sandbags stacked on top of the Prairie du Rocher Creek levee, all three commissioners of the Fort de Chartres – Ivy Landing Drainage and Levee District voted to use dynamite to breach the levee in two additional locations. Because of risk, the COE had argued against such a decision. The village put out a call for help and added a foot and a half of sandbags to the creek levee. Finally, the two openings allowed enough water to escape back to the main channel so that the town was saved from flooding. The levee still stands strong today.

===Recent history===
French settlers founded Prairie du Rocher circa 1722. At least twelve surviving houses in the village were built in the eighteenth century, including the Melliere House, which was constructed in 1735. Another is the Creole House, constructed in 1800, which was built in the French Colonial style by an unknown English-speaking immigrant from the eastern United States.

==Arts and culture==
French customs practiced in Prairie du Rocher include &quot;La Guiannée&quot;, a custom of caroling on New Year&#x27;s Eve dating back to medieval times in France. It has been celebrated in Prairie du Rocher every New Year&#x27;s Eve since settlement in 1722. The town also celebrates &quot;Rendezvous&quot; during the summer, as well as the winter, at the Fort de Chartres. During that time, people from a broad area come to camp out for the weekend. They dress like Indians and French soldiers of the mid-18th century, camp out at the fort, and re-enact the wars that decided the ownership of the fort.

Fort de Chartres is a French military fort constructed in the 18th century. It later was designated an Illinois state historic site.

==Geography==

Spartan Printing employed as many as 1,000 people at its peak. Later, major comics distributors situated their warehouses in and around Sparta.

Sparta was featured in the sixteenth episode of the Small Town News Podcast, an improv comedy podcast that takes listeners on a fun and silly virtual trip to a small town in America each week, in which the hosts improvise scenes inspired by local newspaper stories.

In 2006, then-Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich and local dignitaries opened the World Shooting and Recreational Complex north of Sparta. The ATA hosted its first Grand American at the facility in August, with several thousand shooters attending.

In 2012 the ATA moved their national headquarters to 1105 East Broadway, Sparta, Illinois. All day-to-day operations for the Association are now handled at this location.

<text>Olney ( ) is the county seat in Richland County, Illinois. The population was 9,115 at the time of the 2010 census.

== History ==
Settlement of the Richland County area began around 1815 when Thaddeus Morehouse, a native of Vermont, arrived by wagon and built a log cabin along a stagecoach route that ran from Vincennes, Indiana to St. Louis. This log cabin operated as a hotel and tavern.

Richland County was organized as a county in 1841, when it was formed by a partitioning of Clay and Lawrence counties. There was some controversy regarding the location of the county seat; however, Olney was determined as the choice based on a donation of land and the central location. The name of the town Olney was suggested by Judge Aaron Shaw who desired to honor a friend, Nathan Olney. It was not until 1848 that Olney was incorporated as a village.

The Civil War brought a great deal of turmoil to the county as there were sympathies for both sides. While most citizens rallied around the Union it was necessary to have troops stationed in Olney to enforce the draft as union deserters found refuge among local citizens. Overall, the county was pro-Union and an estimated 1,700 Richland County citizens fought for the Union in the Civil war. Nearly 1,000 Olney residents served in World War I, and during World War II, Richland County may have been the only Illinois county outside of Cook that provided four generals for the war effort.

Among the mayors of Olney was J. B. Porter, noted as an ex-mayor in a 1912 note about his being wounded by gunfire after whipping a man over some unresolved quarrel.

The first census of Richland County was in 1850 at which time 4,012 people resided in the county. One hundred years later the 1950 census found a spot north of Olney near Dundas to be the population center of the United States.

<text>Carbon Cliff is a village in Rock Island County, Illinois, United States. The population was 1,846 at the 2020 census, down from 2,134 at the 2010 census. It lies in the south part of Hampton Township.

==History==
The Chicago and Rock Island railroad (later the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific) reached Carbon Cliff in 1854. By the mid-19th century, Carbon Cliff had become a coal mining center, and was named for the many coal mines that dotted the bluff west of town. The Carbon Cliff mines were the earliest worked on the west side of the Rock River. Stoehr &amp; Schadt Coal Co and others mined extensively for many years, but by the beginning of the 20th century the limited supply of coal was nearly exhausted and mining there was discontinued.

On November 13, 1906, voters of Hampton territory petitioned the county court for permission to incorporate as a village. The citizens voted and with 55 to 28 in favor, Carbon Cliff was incorporated on December 8, 1906.

The Carbon Cliff bluffs were also known as an excellent source of clay. The Argillo Works was formed in 1865 to produce fire brick and farm-drain tile. Argillo&#x27;s products were sold throughout the country and was one of the leading industries of Rock Island County. In the 1930s, fire destroyed the plant&#x27;s offices and buildings and the firm went out of business.

<text>Milan ( ) is a village in Rock Island County, Illinois, United States. The population was 5,097 at the time of the 2020 census; down from 5,099 at the 2010 census.

The village is located adjacent to the Quad Cities of Illinois and Iowa.

==History==
The village is on the Rock River in northwest Illinois, about 4 miles upstream of its outlet to the Mississippi. The village is the site of the south campsites which comprised the Sauk and Fox village of Saukenuk, once the second-largest Native American inhabitation in North America.

Originally platted along the right-of-way for the Hennepin Canal, in 1837, the village site was called in land speculation papers &quot;Hampton&quot; (not the town in Illinois, approximately 13 miles north-northeast, on the Mississippi River—see Hampton, Illinois for more). &quot;Hampton&#x27;s&quot; land speculators, George Camden and Franklin Vandruff, sold land along the Rock River, along a north-west flowing creek, which was re-routed north into the Rock&#x27;s main channel. Along Mill Creek, the industries of wool-carding and (river clamshell) &quot;pearl&quot; button-making helped rename the village by 1841 as Camden Mills. 
The village has &quot;sister cities&quot; in Missouri, Tennessee, and Michigan.

<text>Moline ( ) is a city located in Rock Island County, Illinois, United States. With a population of 42,985 in the 2020 census, it is the largest city in Rock Island County. Moline is one of the Quad Cities at the confluence of the Rock and Mississippi rivers, along with neighboring East Moline and Rock Island in Illinois and the cities of Davenport and Bettendorf in Iowa. The Quad Cities had a population of about 380,000 in 2023. The city is the ninth-most populous in Illinois outside the Chicago metropolitan area. 

Moline was established in 1843. The name derives from the French &quot;moulin&quot; meaning &quot;mill [town]&quot;. The corporate headquarters of Deere &amp; Company is located in Moline, as was Montgomery Elevator; its acquirer Kone has its U.S. division headquartered in Moline. Quad City International Airport, Black Hawk College, and the Quad Cities campus of Western Illinois University-Quad Cities are located in Moline. It is a retail hub for the Illinois Quad Cities, as South Park Mall and numerous big-box shopping plazas are located in the city. Moline&#x27;s downtown serves as one of the civic and recreational hubs of the region as many events take place at the 12,000-seat Vibrant Arena at The MARK and at John Deere Commons.

==History==
===Early history to 1848===
In 1837, David B. Sears and a group of associates built a stone-and-brush dam across Sylvan Slough, thereby connecting the southern bank of the Mississippi River to what is today called Arsenal Island. The dam not only served as an access road between the island&#x27;s settlements and the mainland, but it provided water power for a mill which Sears built to saw wood, grind corn, and card wool. The water power generated by the dam attracted many industrialists. Over the next seven years, a number of factories sprouted up along the shoreline. A factory town was platted in 1843 on the Illinois shore under the working name of &quot;Rock Island Mills&quot;. The name did not stick. When Charles Atkinson, one of the major landowners in the area, was offered the choice of naming the town &quot;Moline&quot; (&quot;City of Mills&quot;, from the French &quot;moulin&quot;, as suggested by a local surveyor P.H. Olgilvie) or &quot;Hesperia&quot; (meaning &quot;Star of the West&quot;), he chose Moline. The town of Moline was incorporated on April 21, 1848 under Illinois state law and granted a charter for a trustee form of government.

The same year, John Deere, the inventor of the self-scouring steel plow, relocated his steel plow company from Grand Detour, Illinois, to Moline. At the time, Moline had a population of only a few hundred, mostly involved in work at the mill. Despite Moline&#x27;s small size, Deere saw several promising elements there: Moline&#x27;s dam and coal deposits would provide a good source of power; Moline was near the other well-established towns of Stephenson (later renamed Rock Island) in Illinois and Davenport in Iowa; and Moline&#x27;s access to the river would make shipping goods cost-efficient. As Deere expanded his factories, Moline grew in area and population.

Charles Atkinson and others successfully lobbied the federal government to get the first transcontinental railroad to pass through Moline and to cross the Mississippi over Arsenal Island. The railroad, which arrived in 1854, carried thousands of immigrants – at that time mostly Swedish, Belgian, and German, reflecting areas of economic problems in Europe – to Moline&#x27;s borders. The immigrants, most of whom knew little or no English, responded to the call of &quot;John Deere Town&quot; by the conductor. The railroad connected the region to the national economy, ending its previous isolation, and ensured the future success of the area. Manufactured goods were increasingly transported over rail instead of by water.

Moline&#x27;s founding fathers were primarily ambitious industrialists from New England. David B. Sears came to Moline from the Northeast by way of Cairo, Illinois, and Atkinson, John W. Spencer, and Spencer H. White, other prominent founding men, were also New Englanders. They brought a stern work ethic and controlled civic life; Moline, in contrast to its neighbors, was not a &quot;shoot &#x27;em up river-town.&quot; An article in the &quot;Moline Workman&quot; in 1854 noted that a &quot;much duller town could not be scared up this side of Sleepy Hollow.&quot; Moline attracted large waves of immigrants from Sweden, who were believed to be family-minded, God-fearing, community-oriented workers who rarely went on strike.

Following incorporation, Moline was laid out in an orderly initial grid of sixteen square blocks with streets named after the primary landowners of the time. The New Englanders chose not to install a town common or park along the river, as they thought the space would be better used for industrial purposes. Many of these founders clearly envisioned a &quot;Lowell on the Mississippi&quot;, after a major industrial city of Massachusetts; Moline was marketed as a &quot;Lowell of the West&quot; to potential investors and immigrants.

As Moline grew around its mills and factories, and as its neighbor to the west, Rock Island, continued to grow at a similar pace, the neighboring towns ran up against one another&#x27;s borders relatively quickly. In the mid-19th century, articles about &quot;consolidation&quot; were a daily feature in the &quot;Moline Workman&quot; and the &quot;Rock Island Advertiser&quot;; city leaders dreamed of the joint city becoming the largest in the state. As local leaders sat down to discuss consolidation, however, disputes arose, with the most important being which city would subsume the other. As the county seat and earliest settlement on the Illinois side, Rock Island argued that it should annex Moline; Moline, being more prosperous and better known nationally, wanted to keep its name. Other points of conflict included that Moline did not want to have to assume any of Rock Island&#x27;s public debt; Rock Island feared that a union with Moline would drive down its property values; and the citizens of the two towns, representing different regions, classes, occupations and ethnicities, widely disagreed on major political issues of the day. Many leaders of Rock Island, a community founded largely by Southerners, remained sympathetic to the Confederate cause throughout the Civil War. Meanwhile, Moline was ardently Republican. The talks of consolidation ceased, although they would later return but were never resolved in favor of the merger.

===1860s–1940s===
After the Civil War, the population of Moline continued to grow. The street grid was expanded to the east and west along the shoreline and to the south up the bluffs. There was a severe housing shortage; few men were rich enough to invest in real estate other than what they could afford to build for themselves, and few incoming workers had sufficient funds to build a home. Nevertheless, Moline&#x27;s expansion was generally an orderly affair. The street grid remained a set of rectangular blocks, and though no zoning commission or local authority directly oversaw construction, the unwritten code of carpenters, masons, and citizens kept the city a well-planned place. Temperance societies and lyceums joined other reform movements and social organizations in prominence within the community. The quality of life was generally regarded as quite good: &quot;The laboring men of Moline are among the most prosperous to be found in the country. Instead of spending their spare earnings in saloons and dram shops, they carefully hoard them and in a few years a little home of their own is the result.&quot;

Over time, John Deere expanded operations into other agricultural equipment, and Deere-affiliated factories employed the bulk of Moline&#x27;s workforce. Soon other Moline-based companies became known around the country for their products. These include Dimock, Gould, and Co., Moline Pipe Organ Co., and Moline Furniture Works, to name a few. In addition, several pioneering automobile companies operated in the city, among them Moline Automobile Company, Moline Wagon Company, Stephens (a marque of the Moline Plow Company) and Velie Motors Corporation.

During the last few decades of the 19th century, Moline had continued prosperity, expansion of the city to the southwest, west, and east along the Mississippi river, and a stronger relationship with neighboring communities. Consolidation talks began again with Rock Island, but failed as the two cities quarreled over which would acquire the other. By 1880, Moline had 7,800 residents, and by 1890 there were 12,000. Rock Island kept pace with 8,500 and 13,000 people respectively. New jobs were created primarily in Moline in this era.

Several improvements in construction and urban planning led to a shift in urban growth strategies in Moline. The first buildings were equipped with heat in September 1897, and electricity first arrived in Moline in 1881 when John Deere &amp; Co. installed sixteen electric streetlights on the roadway outside its factories. Work on an electric streetcar system soon followed, and within the same decade, an intercity streetcar system linked Moline with Rock Island and Davenport. The diminishing reliance on well water or the river allowed home construction to proceed further up the bluff, and the electric streetcars allowed Tri-Citians to live in one community and shop or work in another. Moline&#x27;s streetcar system, the state&#x27;s first and only the nation&#x27;s third, was also Illinois&#x27;s best for a number of years, with a minimal five-cent fare and an extensive coverage area. The state&#x27;s first garbage collection system was also developed in Moline in 1894. In this time, the municipal administration bureaucracy first began to grow, with departments created for sanitation, public works, utilities, and recreation. New public buildings also were constructed; the first public library came in 1873, the YMCA was built in 1885, and Moline Public Hospital opened in 1896.

In the midst of steady growth and changing times, the town&#x27;s founders struggled to maintain their positions of authority. Moline was re-chartered as a city under a mayor/aldermanic form of government on April 21, 1872, and John Deere, the longtime resident and entrepreneur, was defeated by Daniel Wheelock, a newcomer, for the first mayorship. Belgian and Swedish immigrants began arriving in a huge influx, settling into a neighborhood on the bluffs in the southwestern part of the city. Belgian immigrants came predominantly to work in the fledgling auto industry in Moline, Velie Motors, founded by a Deere relative. For a time, Moline had the second largest Belgian population in the country after Detroit. Swedish immigrants continued to be drawn to Deere &amp; Company, with John Deere as leader continuing to hire new employees in droves until his death in 1886.

In 1883 a major overhaul of Moline&#x27;s urban grid was undertaken. Several roads were removed or re-routed in the interest of creating an aesthetically pleasing downtown and a more orderly method of horse and streetcar transit. The model of Lowell was abandoned in favor of that of Pittsburgh, a great river town with a strong urban center. Retail and commerce was encouraged in downtown Moline, and higher density housing began to appear there. The historic street names were replaced by a numerical system in which north–south roads were dubbed &quot;streets&quot; and east–west ones were re-christened &quot;avenues&quot;. Though some complained &quot;the corner of Ann Street and Bass Street… is now merely 17th Street at 6th Avenue&quot;, the new system, inspired by an alderman&#x27;s visit to Philadelphia in 1876 for the Centennial, was generally regarded as a great urban innovation.

Moline was a successful, if somewhat boring, turn-of-the-20th-century city. It was clean, well maintained, and prosperous, and unlike Rock Island and Davenport, contained no slums, congestion, or red-light districts. Despite the occasional conflicts between native-born and immigrant leaders, the Puritanical, serious temperament of the city had not changed in the half-century since Moline&#x27;s founding. The city became known as &quot;Proud Moline&quot; to its neighbors, a somewhat derisive nickname that touched on Moliners&#x27; sometimes haughty, holier-than-thou attitude. The electric streetcar system expanded as the city did, and by 1915 there were over of paved city streets and of sidewalks. Recognizing a need for more recreational space, Riverside Park was established in 1902 near present-day 34th Street on the waterfront, and the Tri-City Railway Company opened Prospect Park in the southern part of the city in 1911 as an amusement park. The widespread prosperity attracted wave upon wave of immigrants, and Moline&#x27;s immigrant workers often sent for their extended families in the Old Country to join them in America. The 1910 census showed the Tri-Cities metro area to have the second highest per-capita income in the United States.

By the 1920s and 1930s, the appearance of East Moline in Illinois and Bettendorf in Iowa reflected the further growth and diversification of the region. Moline emerged as a retail, transportation, and cultural hub on the Illinois side of the river. The first metropolitan airfield, the Moline Airport, opened in 1926 and later provided commercial air service to Chicago and St. Louis. With federal funds from the Works Progress Administration, the Iowa-Illinois Memorial Bridge, a single-span, two-lane highway bridge built for automotive traffic, was concluded between Moline and Davenport in 1935 and quickly became the preferred method for interstate transit. A bustling retail sector emerged in downtown Moline, anchored by merchants like the New York Store, Sears &amp; Roebuck, and JC Penney. The economic reliance on the farm implement industry continued as Deere &amp; Company emerged to become the largest agricultural machinery company in the world. Colonel Charles Deere Wiman, the President of Deere &amp; Company, re-affirmed Deere&#x27;s commitment to the Quad-Cities region by building several new factories in Moline, East Moline, Silvis, and Milan in Illinois and Davenport in Iowa.

===1940s–1980s===

Moline witnessed a continued population increase after World War II with the completion of &quot;Molette&quot;, a subdivision of mass-produced starter homes selling for $5,000 each. Molette was the first Moline neighborhood produced on a mass scale and one of the largest single-unit housing projects in the Midwest at the time. Near Molette on 41st Street, the Defense Department funded an $800,000 housing project known as Springbrook Courts, which served as housing for Rock Island Arsenal employees before being converted into a non-military-affiliated public housing project managed by the Moline Housing Authority. It was in this time that one of the major factors shaping the modern layout of Moline first came into play—the rough topography of the inland bluffs. As Moline grew, the traditional rectilinear grid of the downtown area gave way to smaller subdivisions containing cul-de-sacs, curvilinear roadways, and courts. As a comprehensive plan of Moline later stated, &quot;the topography has had a decided influence upon the growth and development of the city . . . the city is literally interlaced with fingers of wooded ravines draining surface water to the north into the Mississippi and to the south into the creeks and drainage ditches tributary to the Rock River. This condition has greatly influenced the building of underground utilities, the location of thoroughfares, the selection of sites for schools and parks, the design and development of residential areas, and the location of business and industrial areas. The customary &#x27;grid&#x27; type subdivision planning so common to most Midwestern cities is impractical of adaptation when looking at a map of the present city. Some streets . . . have been dedicated but never improved because of the topography and the excessive cost of construction.&quot;

The layout of the city was significantly improved by the approval of the city&#x27;s first zoning ordinance and the creation of a Zoning Board in 1929. Moline became the first Illinois city outside the Chicago area to adopt this tool of urban planning. The zoning board, in its preliminary report, released the following statement: &quot;Generally speaking, [the new zoning ordinance] will tend to promote public health, safety, comfort, morals, and welfare. Specifically, it is designed to lessen congestion in streets and to avoid future congestion; to secure safety from fire and other hazards; to provide light and air about buildings in which people live; to prevent overcrowding of land and avoid excessive concentration of population; to assist in adequately providing transportation, water supply, sewage disposal, schools, parks, and other public requirements.

Although the city did not suffer during the 1950s and 1960s, those decades marked a departure from the city&#x27;s earlier trajectory of unceasing upward growth. The zoning ordinance drawn up in 1929 predicted a population of 70,000–80,000 for Moline in 1980, but Moline actually only attained 45,000 by that year. The primary problem for Moline, and the Quad-Cities at large, in this period was the area&#x27;s lack of a strong national identity. The Moline Association of Commerce marketed the Quad-Cities under the motto of &quot;Joined together, as the boroughs of New York City&quot; throughout the 1940s and 1950s, with Moline as the &quot;nucleus&quot;, but few corporations bought into the analogy. Despite the Quad-Cities&#x27; status as &quot;the largest metropolitan area between Chicago, Omaha, Minneapolis, St. Louis, and Kansas City&quot;, the area remained relatively unheard of. Existing companies, including John Deere, Alcoa, Caterpillar, Case, and International Harvester all continued to grow and expand operations in the area, but no real diversification of local industry occurred; Moline remained steadfastly dependent on the farm implement industry for its economic solvency, a dependency that later proved disastrous.

In 1989, a region-wide comprehensive plan called &quot;Quad-City Visions for the Future&quot; summed up the area&#x27;s problems well. &quot;Growth has been so that the Quad-Cities population is split almost equally between the two states. This is an unusual growth pattern on major rivers that form state boundaries ... . Further complicating the economic and political arenas is the fact that there are five contiguous cities in the Iowa Quad-Cities and eight in the Illinois Quad-Cities. Quad-Cities fragmentation historically has been raised as a major community liability by many different groups and individuals . . . . It is difficult for outsiders to appreciate the opportunities available here; growth and development are more difficult because of the differences in regulations; the distribution of grant money from state and federal governments has not always been efficient or effective; governmental services are more costly when administered by many entities separately.&quot;

As a result of the gradual dissolution of the trends of industrial expansion and the end of the age of immigration, Moline&#x27;s population stagnated throughout the mid-to-late-20th century, settling in the 40,000–45,000 range, where it remains today. The central retail district gradually closed down as the area&#x27;s first shopping malls opened in the early 1970s, pulling business away from downtown. This southward trend in retail occurred despite the extension of Interstate 74 through the city and across the river on the Iowa-Illinois Memorial Bridge in 1974, an infrastructure improvement that made Moline&#x27;s downtown more accessible and brought thousands of commuters and travelers through Moline each day. Though most civic leaders and journalists had been optimistic-–one reporter claimed &quot;almost every indicator of economic, population, and civic growth points to the fact that Moline&#x27;s potential for growth is greater than ever . . . especially in its now readily accessible downtown . . .&quot; – there was no stopping the dawn of the age of strip retailing.

Perhaps the greatest problem befalling Moline in the second half of the 20th century was the farm crisis of the 1980s. Moline&#x27;s economic vitality was sapped as the agricultural crisis crippled the farm implement industry, the force which had shaped the development of Moline since the city&#x27;s earliest days. Plant after plant laid off workers by the thousands, and unemployment in the area soared to twice the national average. Even Deere &amp; Company moved most of its factory operations out of Moline, though it maintained its world headquarters in Moline in a specially commissioned building that was designed by Eero Saarinen. The LeClaire Hotel, the tallest building in Moline and a longtime symbol of the city&#x27;s wealth and prestige, closed its doors. The 1990 census showed a population loss for the city for the second straight decade.

===1990s–2000s===

In the 1990s, Moline began staging a comeback through the redevelopment of its riverfront. Deere &amp; Company demolished its vacant riverfront factories and donated the land to the city so that it could build a civic center on the space. The Mark of the Quad-Cities, now known as the Vibrant Arena at The MARK, was completed in 1993 and is now the home to large conventions, concerts, high school sports tournaments, and a host of other events. The Quad City Steamwheelers, an arena football team, played their af2 home games at the arena from 2000 to 2009 when the league ceased operations. It has also been home to several minor league hockey teams including both the original Quad City Mallards and a newer Quad City Mallards, the Quad City Flames, and the Quad City Storm. In the late 1990s, John Deere Commons was built, a multimillion-dollar entertainment and tourism complex containing a hotel, restaurants, offices, a John Deere Collector&#x27;s Center (located in a re-created 1950s John Deere dealership), the John Deere Store, and the John Deere Pavilion, a tourist center showcasing the history of agriculture in the Midwest. The Commons attracts 400,000 visitors a year, injecting a tremendous boost to the downtown economy. Renovations have been completed on many old brownstone buildings, and plans for shoreline mixed-use condominium and retail developments are in the works on the site of vacant industrial land.

Moline still reflects the rich culture of the successive waves of immigrants from France, Germany, Sweden, Belgium, Eastern Europe, and most recently, Mexico. Events such as the annual Greek Cultural Festival at John Deere Commons, Rolle Bolle tournaments at Stephen&#x27;s Park, and &quot;Viva! Quad~Cities&quot; all reflect Moline&#x27;s diverse heritage. Downtown Moline also plays host to events of regional importance such as Taste of the Quad Cities, Race for the Cure, the Quad City Marathon, and the Lighting of the Commons.

===Present===

Since the late 2000s to the early 2010s, Moline has seen growth in its downtown area. The current projects include a new nine-story building for Kone Elevator&#x27;s American Headquarters (formerly Montgomery Elevator) and its nearly 250 Quad Cities&#x27; area employees. The building opened in August 2012, and also has a combination of active and passive energy strategies includes an array of 1365 distributed solar panels, which is now the third largest in the state of Illinois. Other projects include new lofts that opened up in 2011, and the I-74 Corridor Project is planned to build 3 auxiliary lanes from Avenue of the Cities passed 53rd Street in Davenport, with a new I-74 Bridge spanning 4 lanes in each direction, also an observation deck overlooking the Mississippi River. The new I-74 bridge was completed with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on December 1, 2021. In 2012, Western Illinois University-Quad Cities opened the new river front campus, an $18.2 million first phase of the project has 60,000 square feet, making it the only college campus along the Mississippi River. It includes 14 classrooms and four meeting/conference rooms. Western Illinois University-Quad Cities continued to grow its presence and list of educational opportunities they provide with the completion of Phase II in 2014. The $38 million, five interconnected buildings doubled the size of available facilities at WIU-Quad Cities. The campus addition houses academic programs and services from the colleges of Arts and Sciences, Education and Human Services, and Fine Arts and Communication, and also includes the other programs and services from the former WIU-QC 60th Street campus, including the library, WQPT-Quad Cities public television and classes offered through the Quad Cities Graduate Study Center.

More projects are being planned, all a part of the city&#x27;s &quot;Moline Centre&quot; downtown plan.

==Geography==
The city of Moline is nestled beside and on a broad bluff situated between the banks of the Mississippi River and Rock River in Rock Island County, Illinois. The city&#x27;s highland areas are cut across by many deep ravines that break up the city into natural neighborhoods. The city is bounded to the east by East Moline and to the west by Rock Island.

Moline is located approximately west of Chicago and approximately northwest of Springfield, Illinois. Moline and its neighboring communities within the Quad Cities form the largest urban area along the Mississippi River between the Twin Cities (Minneapolis-St. Paul) to the north and St. Louis to the south, and are located approximately halfway between them. The area is served by four interstate highways: Interstate 74 (which runs directly through Moline, bisecting it in roughly equal halves), Interstate 280 (which serves as a ring road around the Quad Cities), Interstate 80 (which crosses the Mississippi River a few miles to the northeast of Moline), and Interstate 88 (which begins on the eastern border of the Quad Cities and ends in Hillside, Illinois, near Chicago).

According to the 2010 census, the city has a total area of , of which (or 98.62%) is land and (or 1.38%) is water.

===Neighborhoods===
Through the Neighborhood Partnership Program, the City of Moline has established nine city-sponsored neighborhood associations and is working to form more. These associations assist their residents by organizing neighborhood clean-up days, participating in the crime watch program, planning social activities, and other activities.

Notable neighborhoods include Moline&#x27;s downtown, now known as Moline Centre, which is a historic area bounded approximately by 12th and 34th Streets and the Mississippi River and 6th Avenue. The area is home to Moline&#x27;s City Hall, its original, and now vacant, Carnegie-sponsored public library, and other civic institutions.

Other neighborhoods include Floreciente, Olde Towne, Uptown, Overlook, Karsten&#x27;s Park, Wharton (home to Wharton Field House which gives the neighborhood its name), Hamilton Heights, Wildwood, Prospect Park, Park Hill, Forest Hill, Highland, Villa Park, Green Acres, Molette, Rockview Estates, Homewood (home to the Playcrafter&#x27;s Barn Theater), Heritage Park, Stewartville, Deerview, and Walton Hills.

<text>Rock Island is a city in and the county seat of Rock Island County, Illinois, United States. The population was 37,108 at the 2020 census. Located at the confluence of the Rock and Mississippi rivers, it is one of the Quad Cities along with neighboring Moline and East Moline in Illinois and the cities of Davenport and Bettendorf in Iowa. The Quad Cities had a population of 384,324 in 2020. The city is home to Rock Island Arsenal, the largest government-owned weapons manufacturing arsenal in the US, which employs 6,000 people. The original Rock Island, from which the city name is derived, is now called Arsenal Island.

==History==
===European-American Settlement===

The original portion of what is now known as Rock Island was called Farnhamsburg – after the original two homes were built by Colonel George Davenport and Russell Farnham in 1826. Davenport and Farnham were business partners, trading with the local Native Americans. The original city plat was filed on July 10, 1835, and was named Stephenson. It was renamed Rock Island in March 1841.

The southern portion of Rock Island, including today&#x27;s Watch Hill area, was originally known as Searstown. It was named after David B. Sears - who built the Sears Power Dam on the Rock River. Searstown was annexed by Rock Island in 1915.

This area has been a fortuitous place first for settlement and then for steamboat traffic, bridges, and railroads.

===Railroads and development===
The Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railroad (RI) was founded here in 1851, known informally as the Rock Island Line; over the next century, the railroad grew to serve fourteen states but ended in bankruptcy in 1980. As part of later nineteenth-century development, two first-class hotels: the Harper House (built by Ben Harper and opened in February 1871) and the Rock Island House were built in town. The Rock Island Arsenal has manufactured military equipment and ordnance for the U.S. Army since the 1880s.

The Rock Island Southern Railway was an interurban line that ran from Rock Island to Monmouth, Illinois, then onward to Galesburg, Illinois. It was built between 1906 and 1910. A portion of the trackage, from Rock Island to Preemption, Illinois, was shared with the CRI&amp;P line that served the coal mines in Cable, Illinois, and Sherrard, Illinois. The line finally folded in 1952.

===Bridges===

Due to its geography, Rock Island has a rich history of bridge building, including the first railroad bridge across the Mississippi (now gone), an unusual two-track railroad bridge, and the largest roller dam in the world.

The first railroad bridge across the Mississippi River was built between Arsenal Island and Davenport in 1856. Many steamboat pilots felt that the bridge had been intentionally positioned to make it hard for them to navigate, and this conflict reflected a larger rivalry: St. Louis and its steamboats against Chicago and its railroads. Two weeks after the bridge opened, the steamboat &quot;Effie Afton&quot; collided with the bridge, caught fire, and damaged the bridge. The owner of the &quot;Effie Afton&quot; sued the bridge company for damages, and the case, &quot;Hurd v. Rock Island Bridge Co.,&quot; featured Abraham Lincoln as one of the lawyers who defended the railroad at trial in September, 1857. This test case was appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the railroad in 1862. Although the original bridge is long gone, having been replaced in 1866 with a heavier bridge, a monument exists on Arsenal Island marking the Illinois side. On the Iowa side, the bridge was located near where 4th and Federal streets intersect with River Drive.
The Lock and Dam No. 15 and the Government Bridge are located just southwest of the site of the first bridge. The Government Bridge, completed in 1896, is notable for having two sets of railroad tracks above the car lanes. There are only two bridges in the world with this feature. Three other bridges span the river between Rock Island and Davenport. The Crescent Rail Bridge is a railroad-only bridge, completed in 1899. The Centennial Bridge was completed in 1940 for autos only. The newest bridge is the Interstate 280 bridge, completed in 1973. Lock and Dam No. 15, completed in 1934 as a federal Works Progress Administration (WPA) project during the Great Depression, is the largest roller dam in the world. The dam is designed for navigation, not flood control. During flood season, the rollers are raised, unleashing the full flow of the water.

On the south side of the city, overlooked by the Black Hawk State Historic Site, are auto and railroad crossings of the Rock River to Milan, Illinois. This set of bridges also crosses the historic Hennepin Canal and Sears Dam (this was named after the entrepreneur David B. Sears, who previously built the Sears Dam between Arsenal Island and Moline.) In 2007 a new bridge was completed between 3rd Street Moline/southeast Rock Island and Milan. It expedites the trip to Milan, the airport, and points south on U.S. Route 67.

==History==
The City of Silvis (initially named Pleasant Valley) was incorporated in 1906. The city took its name from Richard Shippen Silvis, one of the original settlers whose family operated the Silvis Mining Company. Some older sources give the alternate spelling of &quot;Sylvis&quot; although this spelling is not regularly used today.

=== Rock Island Line Silvis Workshops ===
In 1902, the Rock Island Line decided to build its largest railroad locomotive repair workshop in Silvis, on a 900-acre site between the railroad&#x27;s main line and the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad’s Rock Island branch. Construction began on May 1, 1903; the facilities eventually included a general stores department, repair shop, 45-stall roundhouse with a 90-foot turntable, and two large freight yards east and west.

The need for cheap labor attracted a number of immigrants from Mexico, who worked in the stores, the workshops, or as part of the track laboring team. The railway developed housing for all of its workers and families. This was rented to the workers at favorable rates, which were possible under an agreement with the town that meant the occupants paid no property taxes. The Mexican section, with its own Mexican-run general stores and a Mexican-themed band, became known as La Yarda. When the band waned, the railway-donated boxcars that had once housed its instruments were refurbished to create the Lady of Guadalupe church, dedicated on Easter Sunday in 1927. In 1929 the no-property-tax agreement came to an end, and the city authorities evicted the railway workers. Many moved their houses to the area that became second, third and fourth streets.

After The Rock was liquidated in 1980, the locomotive workshops, yards and facilities were used for storage of locomotives and railcars that soon would be sold off to other railroads. The facility later was sold to National Railway Equipment, with the workshops remaining a maintenance and refurbishment hub for the wider North American railroad industry. Railroading Heritage of Midwest America bought the facility in late 2021 to develop a museum and for refurbishing and maintaining steam and heritage diesel locomotives along with associated rolling stock. In November 2022 heritage equipment from the Union Pacific was moved into the shop. Included were 4-6-6-4 Union Pacific 3985, 2-10-2 Union Pacific 5511 and EMD DDA40X Union Pacific 6936.

=== Golf course ===
The city is home to TPC Deere Run, a public golf course designed by former PGA Tour professional D.A. Weibring along the area&#x27;s famous Rock River. Golf Digest once ranked it No. 42 among U.S. public golf courses, while Golfweek Magazine has called it among the state&#x27;s top five courses. Since 2000, TPC Deere Run has hosted the PGA Tour&#x27;s annual John Deere Classic, previously known as the Quad Cities Open. The John Deere Classic is held in July the week before the British Open.

=== Hero Street USA ===

The name of the city&#x27;s Second Street—a muddy two-block thoroughfare that was once home to Mexican immigrants who worked for the Rock Island Railroad—was changed in 1967 to Hero Street to honor people who lived on the two-block street and served in the U.S. military. A total of 84 men served in World War II, Korea, and in Vietnam. Eight died during World War II: Joseph Gomez, Peter Macias, Johnny Muños, Tony Pompa, Frank Sandoval, Joseph &quot;Joe&quot; Sandoval, William &quot;Willie&quot; Sandoval, and Claro Solis.

Eduvigis and Angelina Sandoval immigrated to the U.S. from Romita, Mexico. Their son, Frank, was a combat engineer assigned to help build the Ledo Road in Burma. He was killed when his unit was sent to the front to fight for control of a key airbase. His older brother, Joe, assigned to the 41st Armored Infantry Division in Europe, was killed in April 1945, just days before the war ended.

Joseph and Carmen Sandoval also immigrated to the United States from Mexico. When the war broke out, they consented to their son Willie&#x27;s request to enlist in the army. Trained as a paratrooper and assigned to the 82nd Airborne Division, he fought in Italy and Germany, and was killed on October 6, 1944, during a combat mission related to Operation Market-Garden, the largest airborne operation of all time.

Silvis Mayor, William Tatmen renamed the street Hero Street USA in May 1967. On 30 October 1971 a city park was built and dedicated as Hero Street Park to honor the eight deceased Hispanic (Latin American) servicemen from Hero Street USA. The park contains a pictorial monument, a grotto, a playground, and a pavilion. The monument contains pictures and biographies of the eight-deceased veteran from Hero Street, the grotto displays the names of all war dead from Silvis.

In 2015, Fourth Wall Films released a documentary, &quot;Letters Home to Hero Street&quot;, by Emmy-nominated filmmakers Kelly and Tammy Rundle.

<text>Carrier Mills, formerly Carrier&#x27;s Mills and Morrilsville, also known as Catskin, is a village in Saline County, Illinois, United States. The population was 1,672 at the 2020 census. Carrier Mills was named after George Washington Carrier&#x27;s saw and grist mills, and was one of the early Cairo and Vincennes Railroad boomtowns. Founded as a mill town and then a coal mining community, Carrier Mills has slowly lost 44% of its population since the 1920 census high of 3,000, due to the decline of the local coal industry. The village has primarily become a bedroom community, located seven miles (11 km) southwest of Harrisburg, which is the village&#x27;s main source of employment, entertainment, and shopping. It is the third largest community in the Harrisburg Micropolitan Statistical Area outside of Eldorado and Harrisburg, and included in the Illinois-Indiana-Kentucky Tri-State Area. Carrier Mills also has a large African American population at 15%, compared to its neighbors, due to migration from the nearby community of Lakeview, the oldest African American settlement in the state of Illinois.

The village is host to the annual Catskin Days Fair and Parade, a multi-day fall festival event in October commemorating the history and culture of the village.

== History ==
The first settler in the village now known as Carrier Mills was Hampton Pankey. He was also one of the earliest settlers in Saline County. Pankey was living in the area in 1804 or 1805 and he registered his land deed in 1814, the earliest date that was available to register them. In about 1811 the settlers began building blockhouses for protection from American Indians. A blockhouse was built on his land around this time. One of his sons was John Pankey, who was one of the founding fathers of Harrisburg.

The village was surveyed by Benjamin D Lewis and platted in November 1872 for William Housely as Morrillsville, named after H. L. Morrill, the Cairo and Vincennes Railroad superintendent who sealed a real estate deal with mill owner G. W. Carrier.
It was commonly known as, and eventually renamed, Carrier&#x27;s Mills after inventor G. Washington Carrier (&quot;Uncle Wash&quot;) who helped found the town when he built an elaborate steam powered saw mill and a grist mill just to the south of town on the Saline River watershed, near the old Tuller Mansion farming and property site. Carrier&#x27;s Mills was the farthest north cypress trees grew at the time, which made lumber milling in the town profitable. Carrier was the first of many to set up wood working factories within the city limits. The mills were first used for the making of lumber to construct bridges and ties for the Cairo and Vincennes Railroad, then later the businesses and homes in the town soon followed.

Carrier and Morrill closed a real estate deal to build a train depot there. The town was platted adjacent and north of the newly completed Cairo and Vincennes Railroad. In 1873, the first postmaster was appointed to Carrier&#x27;s Mills (the name the railroad had assigned to the new stop). The town&#x27;s name changed again to &quot;Carrier Mills&quot; when several more woodworking factories were built. The village was incorporated on September 18, 1894. After an influx of settlers from the south, due to the Civil War, the tiny village amidst timber and farms grew quickly. Today, in legal documents its name remains Morrillsville. Carrier Mills did not have a single brick building and the sidewalks were of boards. The business district was mainly on Oak Street from the First National Bank west to the Texaco Gas Station, and all of frame construction. A disastrous fire in February 1908 burned everything on the north side of Oak Street. In March 1908, fire burned everything on the south side of the street, from Main to Mill, except the Old Woolcott Mill Exchange. The businessmen began immediately to rebuild, all of brick construction.

Tuller Mansion, or &quot;Tuller Place&quot; was a Victorian, 1910, two-story manor, constructed of red brick from the Terre Haute Block Company built on the outskirts of town. There was a grand entry staircase with marble floors, clawfoot tubs, built-in china cabinets, and fine mahogany wood throughout. A large, elegant patio served to entertain guests in hosting social dances, and even a carport existed for the two vehicles that Tuller owned. The mansion was built on the Carrier-Vennum estate, nicknamed &quot;Inland Farm&quot;, by Arthur V. Tuller, inlaw of George Washington Carrier, the town&#x27;s founder. The house burned in the 1990s.

After the lumber boom died out, Coal mining had a great influence on Carrier Mills. Over one hundred coal mines were privately and publicly operated around Carrier Mills between near the turn of the 20th century and the late 1990s. from 1913 to 1933, was the southern terminus of the Southern Illinois Railway &amp; Power Company&#x27;s Interurban Line. The trolley would take residents from downtown, and along Carline Street toward Harrisburg. During the town&#x27;s heyday, some 3,000 people bustled around the busy streets. After the coal mines closed the population dwindled to nearly 1,500 according to the 2010 census. The entire county has suffered dearly from the closing of the coal mines, making Carrier Mills a near ghost town. In 2009 Carrier Mills ended a 70-year-long prohibition. During the 2012 Leap Day tornado outbreak an EF-4 tornado touched down just north of Carrier Mills at 4:51 a.m. on February 29, 2012, destroyed a church and damaged homes along Town Park Road and then traveled ENE toward Harrisburg, where it damaged and destroyed entire neighborhoods of the city.

=== Local school history ===
The first school in Carrier Mills was a large, two-story wooden structure with a bell tower. It was built in the early 1820s and located near the old Sahara Coal Company preparation plant (now abandoned), just northwest of the village. The little structure was made of logs and had a clay chimney. School year began in August and ended in October because of the extreme cold. A typical school in 1850 was a subscription school - a fee of $2.50 was charged for a two-month period. From the Civil War period until 1875, the only formal school was located near Salem.

In 1887, the first school building in Carrier Mills Village was purchased for the purpose of being a prescription school at the corner of Walnut and Main St. The first major public school in the town was opened in 1903 on Furlong St. The first recognized two-year high school course was started in 1915. In 1917, the high school became a registered three-year high school until 1926 when it became a community high school fully accredited by the state of Illinois.

Around 1940, the Carrier Mills Public School building burned down after a disastrous fire starting during a Boy Scout meeting in the basement. A much larger school was built a year later as a grade school around the frame of the first burnt school.

On February 4, 1938, the present High School was completed and occupied, with the gymnasium and auditorium added in 1940. The current enlarged gym was built in 1950–51. At the beginning of 1963, the small town of Stonefort joined the Carrier Mills school district creating the Carrier Mills-Stonefort Unit 2 School District.

=== Downtown abandonment ===
The traditional downtown business district in Carrier Mills stretched from Route 45 down Main Street to Washington Street, and down Oak and Railroad streets between Main Street and Mill Street, but by July 2006, most of the Carrier Mills downtown was condemned and demolished by the city. Citizens of Carrier Mills said it was better to see empty lots than rotten buildings. Most citizens found it sad that it had to come to such a conclusion.

The business district has been in a slow decline for at least 25 years. No single big event can be tied to the decline of downtown Carrier Mills. Will Scarlet Mine closed in 1987. Sahara&#x27;s mines closed in 1993, putting hundreds out of work. Each of those closures reverberated through the local economy. Sahara had a reputation for buying locally—when their purchasing ceased it was a big blow to local businesses. But the Carrier Mills downtown area slowly declining even before the big mine closures.

In its heyday, Carrier Mills was home to several hotels, two theaters (The Knox, and the Grand Theater, opened in 1936 and closed in 1970), two banks (Dodds Bank and the First National), several stores and markets. Nearly all have been slowly torn or burned down over the past 20 years.

There were small stores on Friend, Main, East End and Washington Streets—in some instances a small store could be found every few blocks. The small grocery stores gradually shut down as car ownership increased and people were therefore more mobile—something that contributed generally to the decline of small towns like Carrier Mills.

A new building ordinance was set in July 2006 for future construction plans in the vacant downtown area. According to Mayor Louis Shaw, &quot;What we&#x27;re concerned about is when you walk into town, it doesn&#x27;t look like a farm.&quot;

In April 2007, Carrier Mills Village Board approved entering an agreement with Bob Vancil and Associates to set up a tax increment finance district in an effort to draw new homeowners and businesses. The TIF district is a chance for the village to increase the quality of life with new houses and incentives for improving houses that are in disrepair. Village Board members described establishing the TIF district as a roll of the dice. Vancil will set up the TIF for $15,000 with $5,000 paid up front. If the Scarlet Lake annexation does not happen and the board learns the TIF will not be of benefit to the village, they will not owe the additional $10,000. Vancil said the village will be responsible for paying $3,000 in legal requirements for the TIF, which include giving notice to all businesses and legal advertising in newspapers.

The Scarlet Lake subdivision is a series of 52 lots within the old Will Scarlet strip pit mining area. It will be added to the Village limits as part of the TIF/Annexation project.

In June 2011, the two-story Field and Dime Store building collapsed in Carrier Mills due to disrepair, one of only four original downtown structures that remained in the village.

=== Lakeview (Pond Settlement) ===

Carrier Mills has a great African American history and influence. Free blacks founded the small early pioneer settlement of Lakeview, a mile south of Carrier Mills, shortly after the War of 1812. &quot;The History of Saline County&quot; (published by Saline County
Genealogical Society in 1997) states that &quot;Lakeview, a colored community south of town (Carrier Mills), is an older settlement than Carrier Mills. It is the oldest black settlement in Illinois. It was first named Pond Settlement because of the swamp land that surrounded it. According to local tradition free blacks living in the Pond Settlement helped runaway slaves and indentured servants escape from the saline works and the Old Slave House near Equality, Illinois.

Lakeview had its own school and grocery store along with many homes. In 1850, a Union Church was established near Carrier Mills in Saline County, Illinois. Most members were either Baptist or Methodist. An African Methodist Episcopal Church was organized at the home of Irvin Allen, who built a one-room log church building on his property. After the church burned, the congregation rebuilt and moved the church to Carrier Mills, where it sits today. This congregation is now Baber Chapel AME Church. The Lakeview cemetery has become a state historical landmark. The area of Lakeview is still a nearly 100% black area. After the closure of the Lakeview school in the 1950s, many people moved to the east side of Carrier Mills, named &quot;East End&quot; by locals and in the Carrier Mills Register newspaper. There was much tension felt between the white and black populations in the town.

In 2022 a preliminary application for a federal historical designation district was submitted by Lakeview descendant Brendan Jennings. The Saline County Tourism Board voted to create a committee to spearhead the project. 

In 2023 the Illinois Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) was awarded a $75,000 grant from the National Park Service to recognize significant African American heritage properties in southern Illinois. It was a collaborative effort between the Illinois State Historic Preservation Office, a division of the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, and the Center for Archaeological Investigations at Southern Illinois University to be used to produce National Register nominations for three resources associated with Black history in southern Illinois. Additionally, the project will amend the existing National Register nominations for the following sites including the Carrier Mills Archaeological District, to reflect the African American heritage of the Pond Settlement, also known as Lakeview.
=== Carrier Mills Archaeological District ===

The area, some located approximately two miles south of Carrier Mills was inhabited by prehistoric people in three different archaeological periods. Until the start of the 20th century, the South Fork of the Saline River was a meandering stream with large areas of swamps and shallow cypress lakes nearby. These areas were rich in plants and animals that prehistoric inhabitants sought for food. Therefore, the locality became a natural focal point for human settlement. In 1978 and 1979, archeologists intensively investigated this area. Excellent preservation conditions permitted the recovery of many tools and animal and plant remains that have provided significant new insights into the prehistory of southern Illinois.

Sporadic use of the area by small groups of hunters and gatherers can be dated to 8000 BC, and the area was used more or less continuously until 1400 AD. Settlement activity increased dramatically during the late Middle Archaic Period, 4500 to 3000 BC, when the area was inhabited by larger groups with a more settled lifestyle. These occupants left archaeological evidence containing many artifacts and burials. The area also saw heavy use during the Middle and Late Woodland periods, 200 BC to 900 AD. The peoples of those times increasingly focused on the collection and storage of plant foods and began to domesticate some native plants. The final prehistoric inhabitants were Mississippian Period Indians (900 to 1400) who lived in scattered farmsteads and cultivated corn and squash.

==Catskin Days==
Carrier Mills has been nicknamed &quot;Catskin&quot; due to both an abundance of stray cats in town, and a late-19th century story of the first local merchandise and liquor store owner, Wes Cole, who was tricked by local kids into thinking a skinned cat hide was a mink stole in trade for a jug of whiskey. To this day The village is host to the annual Catskin Days Fair and Parade, a multi-day fall festival event in October commemorating the rich history and culture of the village. The township&#x27;s school mascot is also the Wildcat.

<text>Eldorado () is a city in Saline County, Illinois, United States. The population was 4,122 at the 2010 census, with a 1980 peak of 5,198. Although the city&#x27;s name is spelled as if it were Spanish, the name was originally &quot;Eldereado&quot; or &quot;Elder-Reado&quot; (depending on the source)—a combination of the last names of the town&#x27;s two founders, Judge Samuel Elder, his son William, grandson Francis Marion, and neighbor Joseph Read, and his brother William. According to legend, a signpainter for the railroad painted the name &quot;Eldorado&quot; on the train depot; as a result, the spelling and pronunciation (el-do-RAY-doh) was forever changed.

Eldorado is included in the Illinois–Indiana–Kentucky tri-state area and is a bedroom community in the Harrisburg micropolitan statistical area.

==History==
Eldorado was first platted on May 24, 1858, by a surveyor named Martin D. Gillett. The post office was established on December 8 of that same year. Just before the Civil War, the first businesses were started in the town. The original village was incorporated in 1870. It was founded by Francis Elder and his neighbors who were brothers William and John Reed.

In the early days, Eldorado had several railroads which came through town. It was at an intersection of the Louisville &amp; Nashville and Cairo &amp; Vincennes railways. The &quot;eastern extremity&quot; of the Belleville &amp; Eldorado Railway (St. Louis Short Line) also came through town. According to Illinois Historian Neil Gale: &quot;This settlement, by 1896, could boast of exceptional railroad facilities - The Illinois Central, The Louisville and Nashville, and The Chicago, Cleveland, Cincinnati and St. Louis. Like several other villages, when the railroad company placed the name on the station, the name was spelled Eldorado, instead of Elderedo, and it has been known by that name since that time.&quot;

The city provided relief efforts to neighboring communities affected by the Ohio River Flood of 1937. Shelter was provided at the city hall, and food provided by the Calvary Baptist Church, led by the Red Cross with local help. When the Leap Day Tornado of 2012 struck nearby Harrisburg, Eldorado immediately provided emergency assistance.

Current and former residents often reflect with nostalgia growing up in Eldorado, and doing business in the downtown area. At the center of it is a five-way intersection. A Ben Franklin store stood for decades on the corner of Fourth and Locust streets. The Dairy Queen was a popular hangout, until it relocated outside of the downtown in the 1990s. At one time there were over 20 grocery stores in Eldorado, most were small neighborhood stores. Eventually, these stores and downtown businesses began to disappear due to job loss, population decrease, and the move to businesses on the highways.

The former city hall building is on the National Register of Historic Places.
Eldorado has four official Historical Markers, with the most recent one unveiled on September 18th, 2021.

Eldorado thrived for much of the late 1800s until the 1980s as a coal mining town, until several major mines shut down. Another major employer, Roundy&#x27;s (formerly Scot Lad) closed in 2005, laying off 170 workers.

Today, the railroad tracks have been paved over in favor of bike paths, and most of the downtown businesses are gone.

===Sundown Town===
Eldorado was known as a sundown town until the 1960s. The Eldorado Normal and Industrial Institute was a historically Black college (HBCU), formed with a vision for African Americans to have access to education It was patterned after the Tuskegee Institute, founded by Booker T. Washington. According to the text, J.D. Alston, a notable figure, arrived in Eldorado in 1882 and led the establishment of the school. He was an active leader in the Black community and a driving force behind the school&#x27;s development.

However, the school and the Black residents faced significant racial violence and opposition from the local white community. In a tragic turn of events, in May 1902, a white mob stoned the house of Reverend Peter Green, a pastor at the African Methodist Episcopal Church, who was also involved in opening a Black school. The mob continued their assault by attacking the school itself and firing shots into the homes of Black residents. This act of terrorism forced many Black families to flee Eldorado, and all Black residents eventually left the town due to the threats and violence.

====Resistance from the White Community====
Throughout the early 1900s, the Black community in Eldorado faced relentless opposition. For instance, in 1902, a mob targeted the Black settlement, causing destruction and fear, leading to the eventual exodus of Black residents from Eldorado. The text also recounts how Black students in Eldorado, like “Tilda,” who was one of eleven Black students at the school, faced social exclusion and were prohibited from studying alongside white students. Tilda’s desire to attend the same school as white students led to further animosity, as “Negroes did not want to go to the white school” but were still subjected to exclusion and violence.

====The local authorities and newspapers contributed to the atmosphere of racial tension.====
The Harrisburg Newspaper reported that the Afro-American Protective League, an organization made up of Black citizens of Saline County, met and adopted resolutions denouncing an individual named Alston, labeling him a &quot;traitor to the race&quot; and unfit to lead. This internal conflict likely stemmed from the pressures of surviving in a deeply racist environment.

====The Response from Governor Richard Yates====
In response to the escalating violence, the board of trustees for the Eldorado school reached out to Illinois Governor Richard Yates for protection. The sheriff, however, refused to deputize Black residents to help protect the school and their property, leaving the community vulnerable. In a letter published in the *Inter Ocean* newspaper in Chicago on July 8, 1902, the governor replied, indicating that he was aware of the situation and made promises to protect the school and its members.

In the correspondence, Governor Yates noted, &quot;I suggest you return to Eldorado and open your school at the proper time... I will furnish you by telegraph the assurance that I will furnish you and all members of the school with protection.&quot; Despite these assurances, the violence and resistance persisted, eventually leading the board to relocate the school to Metropolis.

Due to the continued violence, the board voted in August 1902 to relocate the school to Metropolis, Illinois. Despite this decision, the harassment didn’t stop. In 1903, the board thanked the governor, the AME Church, and others for their support, but by then, the damage was done. Black residents had left Eldorado, and the school, which had been a beacon of hope for Black education, was eventually demolished in 1994 due to termite infestation.

J.D. Alston’s legacy is somewhat bittersweet, as he continued to contribute to Black education. He delivered the commencement address at the Frederick Douglass School in Marion, Illinois, in June 1912, and his death certificate lists his occupation as a printer. Yet, the Eldorado Normal and Industrial Institute, which he had worked so hard to establish, could not overcome the entrenched racism in the town.

====A History of Violence and Exclusion====
The violent and systematic exclusion of Black residents from Eldorado is evident in these events. By 1902, Eldorado had essentially expelled its Black population. This was part of a broader trend seen across southern Illinois, where Black communities were violently driven out or severely marginalized. The text notes that Eldorado became known for its exclusionary practices, as the school, which could have been a long-standing institution for African American education, was destroyed by the overwhelming racial hostility in the area.

<text>Harrisburg () is a city in and the county seat of Saline County, Illinois, United States. It is located about southwest of Evansville, Indiana, and southeast of St. Louis, Missouri. Its 2020 population was 8,219, and the surrounding Harrisburg Township had a population of 10,037, including the city residents. Harrisburg is included in the Illinois–Indiana–Kentucky tri-state area and is the principal city in the Harrisburg micropolitan statistical area with a combined population of 24,913.

Located at the concurrency of U.S. Route 45, Illinois Route 13, Illinois Route 145, and Illinois Route 34, Harrisburg is known as the &quot;Gateway to the Shawnee National Forest&quot;, and is also known for the Ohio River flood of 1937, the old Crenshaw House (also known as the Old Slave House), the Tuttle Bottoms Monster, prohibition-era gangster Charlie Birger, and the 2012 EF4 tornado. A Cairo and Vincennes Railroad boomtown, the city was one of the leading bituminous coal-mining distribution hubs of the American Midwest between 1900 and 1937.

At its peak, Harrisburg&#x27;s population reached 16,000 by the early 1930s. The city had one of the largest downtown districts in Southern Illinois. The city was the 20th-most populated city in Illinois outside the Chicago metropolitan area and the most-populous city in Southern Illinois outside the Metro East in 1930. However, the city has seen an economic decline due to the decreased demand for high-sulfur coal, the removal of the New York Central railroad, and tributary lowlands leaving much area around the city unfit for growth due to flood risks.

==History==

===Pioneer and native coexistence===
At the beginning of recorded American history, the Harrisburg area was inhabited by several Algonquian tribes, including the Shawnee and Piankashaw, who lived in the dense inland forests. Prior to the arrival of European settlers, the Piankashaw tribe was driven out by the more aggressive Shawnee. European settlement in Illinois began with the French from 1690 and reached its peak about 1750, mainly along the Mississippi River. American settlers arrived in 1790. The French came as merchants and missionaries, with farming supplementing the need for trade. The result had benefited both the settlers and the Native Americans. The American migration, however, followed treaties which resulted in land being distributed through American Law, ignoring previous indigenous rights. Encroachment ensued and caused hard feelings between the Indians and the settlers who moved into the interior and along migration routes. Many of the Indians allied themselves with the British to resist, though trade with the Americans was an important reason why the Native Americans remained largely peaceful.

The town of Harrisburg was platted a few miles south of the junction of the Goshen and Shawneetown–Kaskaskia Trail, two of the first pioneer trade routes in the state. Prior to the War of 1812, most of the population of today&#x27;s Saline County lived in cabins clustered around blockhouses to protect against Indian attack and dangerous wildlife such as cougars and bears. Permanent settlements in the forested area were inevitable with the influx of more settlers, and the first land entry was made in 1814 by John Wren and Hankerson Rude. By 1840 the settlers outnumbered the Native Americans, and most of the black bear population of the county had been killed off by 1845.

===Founding===
Harrisburg was plotted shortly after Saline County was established in 1847 from part of Gallatin County. The city was named for James Alexander Harris, who had built a farmhouse and planted a corn field in a clearing in the area of the current city square around 1820.

Harris along with John Pankey, James P. Yandell, and John X. Cain, donated land for the first additions of the town to a special committee at Liberty Baptist Church in 1852, after complaints that the county seat should be centralized in the county. The county seat then was in Raleigh. The county&#x27;s two main population centers were divided by the Saline River and of thicket. There were no roads in the county and many residents from the areas of Carrier Mills and Stonefort became lost when traveling to the northern settlements of Raleigh, Galatia, and Eldorado. The designated town plat was considered due to its aesthetic properties, a sandstone bluff overlooking the Saline River valley called &quot;Crusoe&#x27;s Island&quot;. Although it was heavily timbered with oak and hickory with an impenetrable hazel underbrush, the site was at the geographical center of the county. A major legal battle took place within the county government because of voter fraud accusations by the people of Raleigh. Nevertheless, Harrisburg was plotted as a village on in 1853 and became the county seat in 1859.

===Industrial origins===
Between 1860 and 1865 southern cotton became unavailable during the Civil War, Harrisburg was one of the few cities in the Upland South during this time to have woolen mills, making the town an industrial asset early on to Southern Illinois. Several planing mills and flour mills also dotted the city. The Cairo and Vincennes Railroad was completed in 1872 by Ambrose Burnside, and American Civil War, Union Army, brigadier general Green Berry Raum, who was living in Harrisburg at that time.

Robert King, an early proprietor, opened a brick and tile factory at the southern terminus of Main Street in 1896 with the capacity of carrying out 15,000 bricks every 10 hours. Harrisburg also saw the opening of several saw mills. The Snellbaker and Company Saw Mill and Lumber Yard opened in 1895, as well did J.B. Ford Harrisburg Planing Mill the same year. The mill had the capacity of producing of lumber every 10 hours. The Barnes Lumber Company in Harrisburg started as a sawmill operation in 1899. Since 1904 it has retailed a complete line of lumber and building materials and is the oldest, currently active mill in the city.

The Woolcott Milling Company, operated by J.H. Woolcott and J.C. Wilson built a flour mill in 1874, on the now defunct south Woolcott Street, with rail spur, behind the current Parker Plaza, that had 23 grain elevators and the capacity of carrying out 200 barrels of flour in a 24-hour period and up to 400 by 1907, with a new tower. The exchange market was located in Carrier Mills. Located on Commercial Street across the tracks from the train depot, The Southern Illinois Milling &amp; Elevator Company was incorporated on July 29, 1891, by Philip H. Eisenmayer, with a capital stock of $50,000. The company had two elevators, erected at a cost of $125,000, one of which had a capacity of and the other a capacity of 100,000 bushels. Their milling capacity was six hundred barrels per day. Twenty-five men were employed in the operations of the mill and elevators, in addition to a force of from six to eight men regularly employed in the cooperage department.

During the Reconstruction Era, when economic conditions made impractical the growing of cotton, lumbering and tobacco growing (which pioneers found profitable commercially), grain farming by crop rotation, dairying, reforestation, merchandising and manufacturing, and Coal mining especially, began to occupy the city. In 1889, with a population of 1,500, Harrisburg became a city, with an aldermanic form of government. It adopted the commission form in 1915. Despite these early industrial advantages over other cities in the region, the Sanborn Map Company still referred to the water facilities and road conditions within the city limits, &quot;Not good, and not paved&quot; up to 1900.

===Coal and rail era===
First slope mine operations began in 1854 southeast of Harrisburg. During the early years, the coal was transported by wagon to local homes and businesses for heating. Coal Mining became an important industry for the post-Antebellum, now Gilded Age city. The Cairo and Vincennes Railroad was completed in 1872 and provided transportation for coal and the miners who tired away underground. After a series of corporate transactions brought the Cairo and Vincennes Railroad into the hands of the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago &amp; St. Louis Railway around 1890, with Illinois state representative Charles P Skaggs as mayor, Harrisburg evolved into one of the leading coal-mining centers of the Midwest. Harrisburg was a strategic spot on the railroad route with a large hump yard, making it the focal point for the most productive coal field operations. Some of the most profitable coal companies that operated around Harrisburg were Big Creek Coal, Harrisburg Coal and O&#x27;Gara Coal. Each one with their own sizable rail yards. O&#x27;gara was a Progressive Era coal company owned by Thomas J. O&#x27;gara of Chicago. He purchased and annexed 23 privately owned mines in the Harrisburg coal field which equaled of land. The Company based its headquarters in Harrisburg in 1905. O&#x27;gara only owned 12 operating mines, all in Saline County, but they had an annual output of 7,000,000 tons. 6,000 men were employed in a field capacity and the pay roll disbursement was $150,000 per month. The company paid $10,000 monthly royalty. H. Thomas was the company&#x27;s general manager of mines, Ed Ghent its chief engineer and D. B. McGehee the assistant general manager.

By 1905, several small slope mines and 15 shaft mines operated in the county. Most were along the railroad line. Large numbers of immigrants from England, Wales, and eastern Europe, looking for work, detrained at the Harrisburg Train Depot; crowding around quickly expanding mining villages directly outside the city, such as Muddy, Wasson, Harco and Ledford. The city&#x27;s population quickly expanded from 5,000 to 10,000 in a few years. By 1906, the Big four/CCC&amp;STL Railroad became the New York Central, and Saline County was producing more than 500,000 tons of coal annually with more than 5000 miners at work. In 1915 the Ringling Brothers Circus made an appearance in Harrisburg. In 1913, the Southern Illinois Railway and Power Company operated an interurban trolley line, that ran from downtown Eldorado, into Muddy, Wasson, Beulah Heights, through downtown Harrisburg, Dorrisville, Ledford and into downtown Carrier Mills, all of which had larger residential areas than present. In 1917 there were plans to extend the line westward to Marion and Carbondale to connect to the Coal Belt Co. line, and then run it towards St. Louis. The trolley wire through the county was high. It was an off branch of the Cairo and Vincennes Railroad. The corporation erected the first electrical generating plant in Muddy, Illinois.

The Central Illinois Public Service Company purchased the Muddy Power Station in 1916. It had a generating capacity of 7,500 kilowatts. After removing an original 2,500-kilowatt unit, the company added two 5,000-kilowatt turbine-generators and one 10,000 kilowatt unit, bringing the stations total capacity to 25,000 kilowatts in 1922. Electricity generated at the station was distributed over 66-kv, double circuit steel tower transmission lines extending to West Frankfort to the west, the Ohio River to the east, and Olney to the north. The plant had two impounding reservoirs which covered and held 320 million gallons of water.

The community benefited from the prosperity of the Roaring Twenties, flaunting the most extravagant displays of wealth in the city&#x27;s history. The neon red tower belonging to the WEBQ-A.M. radio station was the tallest structure in the city and could be seen for miles. Harrisburg had just finished the new three-story Horning Hotel around 1920, and two new theaters with a combined total of 1,600 seats: the Orpheum and the Grand the same year. The eight-story Harrisburg National Bank building, the O&#x27;Gara Coal Headquarters, the Cummins Office building, and the four-story Harrisburg Hospital were all built in 1923. The new four-story Harrisburg City Hall building was constructed in 1927, and a complex highway system was constructed through the city, with Illinois Route 13 and Illinois Route 34 constructed in 1918; U.S. Route 45 and Illinois Route 145 constructed in 1925–1926. During this time the city expanded to 15,000 people. The annexation of Dorrisville and Dorris Heights created blue collar, multiple, and single family homes filling in between. On Vine Street south of the town square was &quot;Wiskey Chute&quot;, a saloon vice district for local miners. It was also during this time that the town was home to prohibition-era bootlegger Charles Birger, whose gang was said to have protected local business owners better than the law enforcement. For a time, the gangster&#x27;s prized Tommy gun was displayed in a glass case in the City Hall. The geography around Harrisburg changed indefinitely, with coal areas producing a surface mining landscape the size of San Jose, California, roughly , aptly named the Harrisburg Coal Field. The field completely encased the towns of Carrier Mills and Harrisburg, while creating partial borders to Stonefort, Galatia, and Raleigh. Near the mines were gob piles that spontaneously combusted. The horizon around the city for many years flickered with burning coal refuse.

===Slow economic decline===
Harrisburg reached its peak population of 15,659 in 1930, making it the 20th most populated city outside the Chicago Metropolitan Area, in Illinois, and the most populous city in Southern Illinois outside the metro-east. If the city combined the service communities bordering Harrisburg such as Ledford and Muddy, the population would have been even greater at 26,000, and Saline County as a whole reached nearly 40,000 people. Even with the economic downturn during the Great Depression, with business owners and industrial firms closing shop, the city continued to thrive due to its enormous coal industry. On June 17, 1936, Eleanor Roosevelt visited Harrisburg to observe work of the WPA and delivered a speech in the packed high school gymnasium. The heyday ended quickly when the Ohio River flood of 1937 left 4,000 within the city homeless and 80% of the city inundated. Many flooded mines were deemed condemned which left the local economy crippled. In 1938, the state of Illinois had completed one of the largest operations of its kind ever attempted in the United States, the removal of more than two and a half billion gallons of flood water from Sahara mine No. 3.

Soon the Southern Illinois Railway and Power company was bought by the Central Illinois Public Service Company. The inter-urban line was abandoned in 1933 after 20 years of service. After the decommission of the Interurban line, Harrisburg opened the Harrisburg-Dorrisville Bus Co., which was a private predecessor bus company to the current Rides Mass Transit District which was opened in 1980. Between 1930 and 1940 the city lost 27% of its overall population.

Immediately after World War II new coal companies, Peabody, Bluebird, and Sahara, started mining within the city. The war created a great demand for energy, which was satisfied by expanded strip mining operations throughout the Harrisburg Coal Fields. Shortly after World War II, it became clear that coal was losing favor to other energy sources such as oil and natural gas. In contrast to other cities in the United States that prospered in the post-war boom, the fortunes of Saline County began to quickly diminish. Harry Truman stopped briefly in Harrisburg during his whistlestop tour on September 30, 1948, giving some hope for economic recovery for the region. Without hesitating, the long parade of police, buses, and accompanying cars sped through town. Poplar Street, at that time the main drag through town, was crowded with multitudes of persons for its entire length. It was reported by the &quot;Daily Register&quot; newspaper that cars were lined along Route 13 all the way from Marion and on to Eldorado on Route 45. In 1950 Illinois Assistant State Attorney General George N. Leighton represented parents in a proceeding which desegregated the public schools of Harrisburg. On December 1, 1953, WSIL-TV 3 was founded and based out of the city. The station built the , WSIL tower in downtown which was one of the tallest television towers in the state at the time and is still the tallest structure in the city.

By 1957, the Egyptian was the last passenger train to travel through the city. Between 1940 and 1960 Harrisburg lost another 20% of its population due to economic standstill. With only 9100 people left in the city that once had 16,000, then Senator John F. Kennedy made a campaign stop on October 3, 1960. Speaking at the Saline County Court House he said &quot;This district, which is built on the land and which has been nourished by the land, personifies the kind of problems which I think the United States is going to face in the 1960s. This district has depended in the main for its resources, its growth, its wealth, upon the minerals underground and upon the food that is grown on the ground. And those are those industries that have faced serious problems in the 1950s.&quot;

Later during the same speech, after addressing agriculture, Senator Kennedy stated:

&quot;Farmers could farm and work in the cities and towns, but this year we have the highest unemployment that we have had in any months of August and September, the three Augusts and Septembers preceding the recession of 1949, 1954, and 1958, and this district knows this problem well, because this district has lost 60,000 people in the last 10 years.&quot;

By 1968, with hopes of bringing a new influx of coal mining into the city, Sahara Coal Company ordered the Bucyrus-Erie &quot;GEM of Egypt&quot; strip mine shovel, one of the largest in the world at 8 stories high and weighing 1,000 tons. It took three men to operate it, and its bucket capacity was 30 cubic yards. Even with such great efforts coal mining continued to dwindle within the community. The train depot was razed in 1972 and all coal freight was ordered out of the Harrisburg Hump Yard by 1973. During the 1970s and 1980s, many of the city-square storefronts and mini-plazas became vacant and were slowly abandoned as large chain stores and strip malls on Commercial Street became the dominant venues for shopping and entertainment, hoping to bring an influx of travelers from the main highway.

The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 legislation forced many utility companies in the United States to switch to low-sulfur coal. In response Harrisburg&#x27;s already waning economy took a severe downturn. The freight yard had closed in 1982; Sahara Coal Company shut down operations in 1993, and 865 jobs were lost in the county that year. This ended the reign of big coal in Harrisburg, a way of life for residents for over 100 years. The Cairo and Vincennes Railroad/Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway system tracks were taken up in the late 1980s and replaced by the Tunnel Hill State Trail in 1996.

===Post-coal economy===
Soon Pioneer history was showcased at the Saline County Area Historical Museum on the city&#x27;s southern edge. The site includes the three-story high Old Pauper Home, which was once part of the county&#x27;s poor farm, built in 1877. The site also features a variety of cabins, a one-room school house, a small church and other historic buildings that have been acquired, moved to the site and restored.

The Harrisburg-Raleigh Airport is located approximately four miles north of Harrisburg on Highway 34. The Harrisburg-Raleigh Airport Authority operates the airport. The Airport has two runways–32/14 and 6/24. Runway 24 includes a extension, bringing the runway to with a GPS-RNAV approach.

Two industrial zones were set up within the township in 1974 by the Saline County Industrial Development Co., one located in Dorrisville, and the other located near the Harrisburg-Raleigh Airport. The one in Dorrisville had the advantage of rail spur prior to the removal of the New York Central tracks. A Tax Increment Finance district was built on the property of the old rail yard north of the city where the Harrisburg Professional Park was built.

The 2000s saw a slight economic boom to the city. The industrial base within the city, while most were not coal-related, gave opportunity to a number of city residents. American Coal and Arclar, the only two coal mines in the county were producing low sulfur coal as an energy resource. Kerr-McGee Coal Corporation&#x27;s Galatia Complex was purchased by the American Coal Company in 1998. American Coal employed about 580 workers, while Arclar employed 175 persons. Nationwide Glove Factory employed 225 persons, and American Needle was the second-largest non-coal company with 125 workers. Southern Truss and Harrisburg Truss companies employed together 100 employees manufacturing building components. In 2008 construction on the Harrisburg Wal-Mart Supercenter was completed. Wal-Mart will give $21,950 in grants to the Anna Bixby Women&#x27;s Center, Bridge Medical Clinic, CASA of Saline County, Harrisburg District Library, Harrisburg Police Department, Harvest Deliverance Center Food Pantry, Regional Superintendent of Schools, Saline County Senior Citizens Council and Saline County Sheriff&#x27;s Department. The building is and added 150 new jobs to the county. The Supercenter became the second-largest employer in the city, with 340 employees on its payroll. A new strip mall was completed on the south side of town, and Parker Plaza, the oldest shopping center in town was renovated with a new facade to promote commercial growth in the city.

Things slowly took a turn for the worse when former Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich&#x27;s decision to move a division of I-DOT to Southern Illinois was overturned by his successor Pat Quinn. Blagojevich&#x27;s decision outraged lawmakers in Springfield. A lawsuit was filed to stop the move to Harrisburg. Matters were exacerbated when videos of the new home for the IDOT traffic safety division being surrounded by water surfaced on YouTube in late 2007.

The early 2010s saw a series of unfortunate economic events for the city. In December 2010, Harrisburg&#x27;s AMC, formerly Kerasotes&#x27; Cinema 4 theater, closed. This was the first time Harrisburg had been without a cinema since 1920. After release of the 2010 census, in February 2011, the city learned that its population had dropped to a low of 9,017 people, an 8.5 percent decrease. It was the lowest population since the pre-coal boom of 1900. Harrisburg also suffered from numerous scandals involving the school district and police department. In 2011, the Chief Deputy of the Saline County Sheriffs Department was sentenced to prison for sexually abusing a high school student who was working as an intern. The biggest hit was in late February 2012, an EF4 tornado hit Harrisburg during the 2012 Leap Day tornado outbreak. The southern part of the city was heavily damaged, with houses and businesses destroyed, many of which were completely leveled. Eight people were killed and 110 were injured by that tornado. In November 2012 a decision was made to close Willow Lake Mine, one of the last remaining mines in Saline County, putting 400 employees out of work.

In 2016, Harrisburg opened a new movie theater. In 2018 Mason Ramsey, a boy from Golconda, went viral after yodeling his rendition of Hank Williams&#x27; &quot;Lovesick Blues&quot; in the Harrisburg Walmart. Within a few days videos of his performance collectively garnered over 25 million views and he became a viral sensation and Internet meme.

Harrisburg continues to be the retail hub of Saline County. It holds the nearest shopping centers, restaurants, churches, gas stations, banks, and other commerce within miles. However, industrial jobs are scarce.

==Geography==
Harrisburg is located at (37.733765, −88.545873). According to the 2010 census, Harrisburg has a total area of , of which (or 96.91%) is land and (or 3.09%) is water. The square in the center of town, as well as Dorrisville and Gaskins City, stand on top of a series of sandstone bluffs that were once islands rising above natural lowlands, above sea level, dredged by the middle fork of the Saline River. The Saline River was a navigable river used by early settlers for transportation to and from Salt Works just east of Harrisburg. The Saline flowed towards the Ohio and flooded every spring in events called Freshets. The locals called the island &quot;Crusoe&#x27;s Island&quot;. When the area was drained, homes and businesses were built in the floodplain, and it became prone to serious flooding for years to come. The town square in the center of town is a sandstone bluff above sea level, one of the first that start the Shawnee Hills to the south. Topographic maps show the bluffs that rise from the Saline River that wraps the northeast part of the city. Harrisburg is located at the ending point of the Laurentide Ice Sheet, which covered about 85 percent of Illinois. The edge of Illinoian ice sheet(s) lay further south than the southernmost extent, i.e. Douglas County, Kansas, of any of the Pre-Illinoian ice sheets.

=== Gateway to the Shawnee National Forest ===

More than of Shawnee National Forest lie to the south of Harrisburg, drawing visitors annually to the Saline County area and the gateway community. The Shawnee National Forest offers much to see and do. The national forest has of roadways, some of streams and frequent waterfalls, numerous ponds and lakes as large as (some with swimming beaches), 13 campgrounds, many picnicking sites, and seven wilderness areas where trails are designed for hiking and horseback riding.

Plant life is extremely diverse and ranges from sun-loving species to those that grow in dense shade. Tree cover dominates the publicly owned acreage, and is a significant component on privately owned lands. Oak-hickory is the predominant timber type, however, many other commercially important timber species also occupy significant acreages. More than 500 wildlife species can be found in the Forest, including 48 mammals, 237 birds, 52 reptiles, 57 amphibians, and 109 species of fish. There are seven federally listed threatened and endangered species that inhabit the Forest, as well as 33 species which are considered regionally sensitive, and 114 Forest-listed species.

When the Shawnee Purchase Units were first established, temporary headquarters were set up in Room 303, First Trust and Savings Bank Building, Harrisburg, Illinois. This was the only modern office building in the town of Harrisburg suitable for headquarters, and the forest has continued to occupy this building as Supervisor&#x27;s offices. Expansion of the offices has continued since 1933, until today (June 1938), ten rooms on the third floor, and four rooms on the fourth floor, are leased by the Forest Service. Employees who were here during the early days of the forest tell of the chaos and confusion caused by the small space under lease, the incoming shipments of equipment and supplies, and the constant inflow of new personnel.

===Cottage Grove Fault System===
After the 5.5 Richter Scale magnitude 1968 Illinois earthquake, scientists realized that there was a previously unknown fault under Saline County, just south of Eldorado near Harrisburg. This fault is called the Cottage Grove Fault, a small tear in the Earth&#x27;s rock running west–east, in the Southern Illinois Basin. The fault is connected to the north–south trending Wabash Valley Fault System at its eastern end. Seismographic mapping completed by geologists reveal that monoclines, anticlines, and synclines are present within the region; these signs suggest deformation during the Paleozoic era coincident to strike-slip faulting nearby.

A focal mechanism solution of the earthquake confirmed two nodal planes both striking north–south and dipping approximately 45 degrees to the east and to the west. This faulting suggests dip-slip reverse motion, and to a horizontal east–west axis of confining stress. The rupture also occurred partially on the New Madrid Fault, responsible for the great New Madrid earthquakes in 1812, consisting of the most powerful earthquakes to hit the contiguous United States.

===Cityscape===

During the early 20th century, urbanization of the city due to the geographical feature of &quot;Cruesoe&#x27;s Island&quot; and surrounding coal mining property created a density not seen in many cities of its size. The city at the time with a population nearing 10,000 was forced to tightly cram homes and businesses upon the sandstone outcropping less than a square mile in diameter leading many to build their buildings with multiple stories around the town square. The Saline County courthouse and square have gone through many transformations within the past 100 years. In the 19th century, the town had dirt streets with a large Greek Revival courthouse with Doric columns built by Swiss-born, Evansville, Indiana Architect J. K. Frick &amp; Co in 1861. The courthouse was replaced in 1906 with a larger building designed by then well-known architect John W. Gaddis of Vincennes, Indiana. The structure was an identical model to the Perry County Courthouse at Perryville, Missouri, both built the same year. A smaller version of the central clock tower of the courthouse, including the original clock, manufactured by the Howard Clock Company, of Boston Massachusetts in 1904 was recreated in 1996, and placed in a small lot behind the Clearwave Building&#x27;s parking lot. The Howard clock company was notable for manufacturing large clocks in such buildings as the Wrigley Building in Chicago, and the Ferry Building in San Francisco, California. The town square was completely surrounded by brick streets in 1906. Harrisburg had of brick streets, but now only a few blocks are left.

Harrisburg has not yet begun a National Trust for Historic Preservation, Main Street historical preservation program. Saline County is within a recognized historical district, the &quot;Ohio River Route Where Illinois Began&quot;. Two buildings in Harrisburg are currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places, those being the City Hall and the Saline County Poor Farm.

The square itself held an array of coal mining offices, privately owned business, grocery and department stores, pharmacies and bars. During the closing of the coal mining era, most of the businesses left the square and moved to the main drag of Rt. 45, constructed in 1926. The courthouse built by John W. Gaddis was replaced with a modern, more efficient building in 1967 after the older building was condemned. Over the years, the architecture that graced Harrisburg square has slowly turned to rotting older structures mixed in with a hodge-podge of newer updated buildings. Currently there are a few privately owned downtown renovation projects in progress on and around the square.

The Harrisburg Mitchell-Carnegie Library, located on Church Street south of the square and built with a grant from Andrew Carnegie, was built in 1908 and opened to the public in 1909. The building served the community until 2000 when the library was moved to a new building on north Main Street. During the 1937 flood, the library was used as a makeshift hospital until the water boiler burst. The building now serves as a church.

Harrisburg has three city parks. Memorial Park, Gaskins City Park, and Dorris Heights Park. Memorial Park, on the west end of town, is the largest with the city park pool and a large lagoon snaking through the center, founded in 1935.

The Sunset Lawn Cemetery is the largest in the county, founded in 1880, connected to the west edge of the city. The cemetery contains ornate tombstones and crypts, within which are the remains of most of the city&#x27;s original founders and prominent residents. Sunset Lawn contained the 90-year-old Sunset Mausoleum. The crypt had marble floors, with 75 persons buried inside. The structure was condemned in 2008 and there were plans of removal of the bodies and reburial within the cemetery, but due to problems finding many of the family members, has not came to fruition.

In May 2010, on 301 N. Granger Street, the 1895 home of city bricklayer and early proprietor Robert King was set to be demolished. The homeowners donated it to Saline County Habitat for Humanity last year hoping that the organization might be able to restore it. The home was considered &quot;unrestorable&quot;. In 2012, Harrisburg High School was placed on the Landmark Illinois endangered buildings list. Two seniors at Harrisburg High School were preparing a nomination of the building for listing in the National Register of Historic Places, and they helped to distribute a petition through social media to help save the school.

===Harrisburg neighborhoods===
Harrisburg is split up into several small neighborhoods that were annexed into the city limits over time, from north to south.
* Dorris Heights – A subdivision established in 1923 on land owned by W.S. and Bertha Dorris. Annexed in 1979. Sits to the direct north of Harrisburg with the Dorris Heights Street being the main road through the area. The Saline County Fair Grounds sits to between Dorris Heights St. and the Levee to the north. Small Street heads east from Dorris Heights towards the Arrow Head Point shopping center.
* Buena Vista – Situated to the south and north of Route 13 (Poplar Street), and west of the main village. It holds the newer town water tower and several homes. It is bordered by Liberty to the south.
* Wilmoth Addition – Is an area of prominently African American residents north of Old Harrisburg, and just south of Dorris Heights. A good portion of the Wilmoth Addition was slowly abandoned and torn down when the Rt. 13 bypass was built in 2008.
* Old Harrisburg Village – The streets that surround the town square. It includes everything on Main street north and south, and Poplar street from the levee to the east and the town park to the west. It also includes the High School, the old Junior High, West and East Side schools, the Courthouse, the town park and cemetery to the west, and the main shopping strip on Route 45. This part of the city is the oldest, and is recognized mainly by the densely packed gilded age houses and structures lined on narrow brick streets. Most of this area is located on &quot;Crusoe&#x27;s Island&quot;, and was built during a pre-automobile-centric Harrisburg.
* Gaskins City – Includes a small village annexed in 1905, named for the Gaskins family of Harrisburg, prominent business owners and coal entrepreneurs of the Egyptian Coal Company, later sold to O&#x27;Gara. Gaskins City is a series of several blocks that exists to the east of the Harrisburg Levee and Route 45. Sloan Street crosses Route 45, runs straight into the center of Gaskins City and terminates at the Harrisburg Medical Center. It contains Gaskins City Baptist Church, Shawnee Hills Country Club, and is an upper-class neighborhood. It used to have its own school at one time. A large part of Gaskins City was obliterated by the 2012 EF4 Tornado. Part of Harrisburg Medical Center was also heavily damaged.

* Garden Heights – Slightly south of Gaskins City. Connects it with Route 34 and Pankyville.
* Dorrisville – Straight south of Harrisburg, and established in 1905 with a post office, and annexed by the city in 1923. Dorrisville holds the Dorrisville Baptist Church, the Saline County Area Historical Museum, and &quot;Pauper Farm Crossing&quot;, which is on the crossroads of Feazel Street and Route 45. Most people recognize Dorrisville as the first 5–6 blocks north, west, and east of the Feazel Street and Barnett Street 4-way stop. A large part of Dorrisville along the Barnett Street corridor and south of Main Street was destroyed in the tornado. Many houses were destroyed or had lost their roofs.
* Liberty – Was a smaller rural community to the far southwest of Harrisburg along Liberty Road. It included Liberty Church and cemetery. In 1873, designer of the Cairo and Vincennes Railroad, Green Berry Raum of Harrisburg, opened a slope mine on the south side of the rails near Liberty. It became the first in the county to ship coal by rail-car. The mine was called Ledford Slope, and the spot was called Liberty Crossing. Liberty is bordered by the old mining community of Ledford south of Harrisburg, Dorrisville to the west, and Buena Vista to the north. Liberty holds the new Junior High building.
* Ledford – Ledford had been a complete town unto itself. It was the home ground of Charles Birger, and had several stores, its own school system, and a post office. Ledford was a coal mining community set up by mostly Hungarians during the 19th century. It holds a large cemetery, an historic Hungarian cemetery, and the Ledford Baptist Church. Ledford is spread across a span of land along Route 45 between Carrier Mills and Harrisburg, with several roads branching off to the left and right of the highway. It is all considered &quot;Ledford&quot;.

=== Climate ===
Harrisburg has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;), bordering on a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dfa&quot;) with neither large mountains nor large bodies of water to moderate its temperature.

=== Natural disasters ===

==== Flood risks ====
Flooding along the Ohio River, causing back flow of the middle fork of the Saline River has plagued Harrisburg over the years. The city was flooded in 1883–1884 and again in 1913. The most severe came during the Ohio River flood of 1937 when much of the city, except &quot;Crusoes&#x27; Island&quot;, a downtown orbit that encircled the town square, was underwater. High water had reached from the river, and the city was flooded in its position among tributary lowlands. 10,000 out of the 16,000 residents were left stranded on the crowded &quot;island&quot; for weeks, while the other 80% of Harrisburg was completely inundated. By the time the flood waters had receded, 4000 were left homeless. Between Gallatin County and Harrisburg, about of Illinois Route 13 was covered by of water; motorboats navigated the entire distance to rescue marooned families. National guard boats were the means of transportation in the city, and several thousand people were transported daily from temporary island to island. According to the Sanborn Map Company, Harrisburg in October 1925 had a population of 15,000, and in a revised version by January 1937 the population had fallen to 13,000. After that, a levee was erected north and east of the city for protection from future floods. The levee became the unofficial northern and eastern border of the town. No businesses or residences exist in the Saline River Middle Fork floodplains. Flooding reoccurred in January 1982 due to drainage problems from the frozen ground, and in 1983, due to of rain. The Pankey Branch pumping system, on the east side of town, was built to handle flooding from the Saline River only, and has serious complex watershed technical problems, causing continual water backup within the levee during large rain events. The city rebuilt a new pumping system and requested the Army Corps of Engineers to certify the levee.

==== Flood of 2008 ====
In Saline County, a preliminary estimate indicated $16.8 million in damage caused by of rain on March 18–19, 2008. At least 30 homes and 44 businesses had water over the first floor. Many business owners faced quite a task as they assessed the damage and began cleaning up. Others were able to reopen fairly quickly after suffering only minimal damage or waiting for flood waters to recede so that customers could reach their businesses. Harrisburg officials reported 74 businesses affected by flooding, Businesses along Commercial Street (U.S. Route 45), were hardest hit. Kroger, which had just undergone a major renovation, reportedly had or more of water inside. The Federal Emergency Management Agency denied flood recovery grants and loans to Illinois. Flooding in the city was being called the worst in 71 years.

==== 2012 tornado ====


Spawned by a weather system that had originated in Kansas, an EF-4 tornado slammed into Harrisburg early on the morning of February 29, 2012. The tornado touched down just north of Carrier Mills at 4:51 am, destroyed a church and damaged houses along Town Park Road, and then traveled ENE through the Harrisburg Coal Field just north of Ledford, and then went through Liberty, where it damaged Harrisburg Middle School. The tornado then reached the south-western edge of the city at 4:56 am, specifically Dorrisville, which suffered significant property damage, and then churned eastward to Gaskins City which was nearly leveled; seven people were confirmed dead in that area, most killed in an apartment complex that was crushed by another residence, and 110 were injured overall. On June 3, another victim died in the hospital from their injuries, raising the death toll to 8. Harrisburg Medical Center was also significantly damaged in Gaskins City. Peak winds were estimated to have been about 180 mph, and the width of the tornado path was 275 yards, traveling 26.5 miles. In Harrisburg, more than 200 houses, and about 25 businesses were destroyed or damaged heavily. At least 10 houses and other buildings were leveled completely, and several structures were displaced from their foundations. Early estimates indicated nearly 40% of the city was damaged or destroyed. The following night, a mandatory curfew was enforced in the effected areas, from 6 p.m. through 6 am. Counting the damage and death toll, it was reported to be the worst storm since the Joplin, Missouri, tornado. Harrisburg Unit 3 schools were closed until March 5, 2012, and later they offered trauma counseling to students after reopening.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency and IEMA began doing preliminary damage assessments on March 5, 2012, to determine the need for public assistance. The storm damage in Harrisburg dominated national airwaves for several days, with both Anderson Cooper and Diane Sawyer doing special reports. Both &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; published articles about the resilient history and nature of Harrisburg to rebound from the tornado and floods that have hit the city since its founding in 1889.

<text>Raleigh is a village in Saline County, Illinois, United States. The population was 330 at the 2000 census.

==History==
The village of Raleigh was the seat of Saline County following the county&#x27;s troubled creation in 1847. Raleigh had its own school, several stores, and was a bustling village. Now, along with many Saline County towns, Raleigh has been abandoned by business and commerce, leaving only 350 residents.

On October 11, 1847, at a meeting of the County Commissioners held in Curran, a location and name for a County Seat for the newly formed Saline County was established. The Musgrave family, having moved from Raleigh, North Carolina, convinced the group to name the new county seat &quot;Raleigh&quot;. William St. C. Clark, Israel W. Crawford, and Martin Kittinger helped Archibald Sloan survey the town. George Bond, William Carr, and William Stricklin were to build a county road reaching from Raleigh to the boundary line of Saline and Williamson Counties. Raleigh Township was six square miles. When the surveying was completed, there were only three families living in Raleigh. The family of Andrew Musgrave owned 200 acres of farm ground. Mrs. (William) Crawford and Archibald Sloan were the other two occupants.

Lots in the town were sold to raise money to pay for the construction of a new county courthouse. Some of the earliest Raleigh residents were: Alfred Aldrich from Posey County, Indiana (built a log house and opened a store), John F. Ammon (station agent), John Choisser from Kaskaskia, James M. Gaston, Henry Goodrich (blacksmith), Mr. McElvain, Tom Mitchell, Osborn Powell (blacksmith).

The first courthouse was a 20&#x27; x 24&#x27; building constructed by James M. Gaston from logs. It was two stories tall. The courtroom occupied the entire first floor. The second story held two rooms and a hallway, used during court proceedings for grant or petit purposes. The courthouse was finished August 15, 1858, at a cost of $5,500.00. About 8 months after completion of the new building, a group began scheming to have the courthouse, and hence the County Seat, moved out of Raleigh.
The subject of taking the County Seat away from Raleigh was a very heated, hostile event. Arguments held that Harrisburg was a more central location. Petitions were passed around that put the issue on the ballot; a margin of 15 votes decided the fate of Raleigh. Raleigh filed suit but they never got their day in court because each time a date was set the hearing was postponed with no action every being taken and the suit was finally thrown out of court. It is rumored, and is included in the records in the Inventory of the County Archives of Illinois that some Harrisburg residents bribed the court. Accusations have been made that a group of people actually sneaked into Raleigh one night, broke into the Courthouse, stole the county records, and took them to Harrisburg. Only two families were living in Harrisburg at the time Harrisburg became the County Seat. The last County Court held in Raleigh was in June 1858.

<text>Auburn is a city in Sangamon County, Illinois, United States. The population was 4,771 at the 2010 census, and 4,681 in 2018. It is part of the Springfield, Illinois Metropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==

Auburn was originally platted in 1836, a mile north of its present location. It was one of several towns named Auburn that were platted in Illinois during the town lot boom of the 1830s. George and Asa Eastman, who had purchased a large amount of land in the area, platted the town. Their sister Hannah named it for Auburn, Maine, near their family home.

The Eastman family operated a tannery and steam-powered flour mill at Auburn until 1841, when they moved to Springfield. Their departure left Auburn with about six households. Most towns founded in this period failed, but Auburn was able to survive thanks to being located on a postal stagecoach line between Alton and Springfield, so that from 1839 on Auburn was the site of the local post office. The stage coach road followed the present-day path of Illinois State Route 4. Despite its small size in this period, Auburn had a tavern and shops and served as a gathering point for the open-country community around it.

The route of the Alton and Sangamon Railroad, which began running in 1852, bypassed Auburn. In 1853, the town was moved a mile south to its present location on the railroad. By 1860 it had a population of nearly 250 people. The relocated town was initially known as &quot;Wineman&quot; after the local landowner who had induced the railroad to bypass Auburn. When the state legislature incorporated it in 1865, however, the town was renamed Auburn.

From the 1880s to 1924, coal mining dominated Auburn&#x27;s economy. The miners were mostly new arrivals, but the descendants of old settlers owned many of the local businesses.

In 1896, the Auburn post office was the site of the first Rural Free Delivery service in Illinois, part of a nationwide test. Three rural letter carriers rode 35-mile routes. The experiment was well-received: some local farmers changed their post office to Auburn to take advantage of the new system. The First Assistant Postmaster General noted that the roads in the area were &quot;almost as difficult of transit as when Abraham Lincoln &#x27;rode the circuit&#x27;&quot;.

A fire in 1910 destroyed much of Auburn&#x27;s town square.

From 1926 to 1930, US Route 66 passed through Auburn, approximately along the present-day route of State Route 4. A brick-paved portion of the original Route 66 alignment, known as the &quot;Auburn Brick Road&quot;, survives just north of Auburn and has been listed in the National Register of Historic Places for its engineering significance. The brick paving was not completed until 1931, when US 66 had already been realigned to the east.

<text>Clear Lake is an unincorporated community and former incorporated village in Sangamon County, Illinois, United States. The population was 267 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Springfield, Illinois Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Clear Lake is located at (39.814177, -89.566965).

Clear Lake is located northeast of Springfield, southwest of Riverton, and immediately west of the Sangamon River.

==History==
Camp Butler National Cemetery is located just to the north of Clear Lake. There is also a body of water located in the village called Clear Lake. Civil War-era Camp Butler’s training and mustering grounds were on the banks of and close to Clear Lake. As an isolated, sand-bottom lake, it provided relatively clean water for the troops and horses. After the Civil War this was a popular recreation area for many in the Springfield area. Clear Lake declined in importance after the larger Lake Springfield was built in the 1930s. The lake was bought by the City of Springfield in the 2000s as a backup water source.

George Donner, of the infamous Donner Party, lived in the Clear Lake area with his family and is buried at Oak Hill cemetery in Clear Lake.

The village of Clear Lake was incorporated by referendum in 1955. The first slate of officers were all members of a new political party known as the Clear Lake Independents, and ran unopposed.

The village was dissolved by referendum in 2022 (by which time it was officially known as &quot;Clearlake&quot;). Government services were taken over by Clear Lake Township and Sangamon County. The dissolution referendum passed by an overwhelming margin, with only 2 out of 38 votes opposed. It followed an earlier referendum in 2015 that failed by two votes, 19 to 17.

==Formosa Plastics==

Borden, Inc constructed a PVC plant west of Illiopolis in 1962 in the industrial area that had been the Sangamon Ordnance Plant. It operated the plant until 1987 when it transferred to Borden Chemicals and Plastics Operating Limited Partnership. Following that company&#x27;s bankruptcy, the facility was purchased by Formosa Plastics Corporation in 2002. On April 24, 2004, the Formosa Plastics plant (formerly Borden) in Illiopolis exploded, killing five people, injuring others and causing a portion of the town to be evacuated. The fire burned for several days and the plant had not reopened as of 2007. On March 6, 2007, the United States Chemical Safety Board (CSB) released its final report on the incident indicating that an operator bypassed a safety interlock and drained a pressurized reactor instead of an empty one they were in the process of cleaning. The report listed as root causes, that Formosa-IL and Borden Chemical &quot;did not adequately address the potential for human error.

<text>Leland Grove is a city in Sangamon County, Illinois, United States, located adjacent to Springfield. It is part of the Springfield Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 1,503 at the 2010 census.

== History ==

Leland Grove was incorporated by a referendum of residents of several subdivisions in Woodside Township in April 1950 in order to improve the roads in the area, which at the time were mostly unpaved dirt roads. The city had an initial population of 1,060 people, and later grew by annexing additional subdivisions in the area. The new city succeeded in paving nine miles of roads in its first year and half, although this led to a significant budget deficit. The first city government, consisting of a mayor, clerk, treasurer and six aldermen, was voted in without opposition on June 20, 1950.

Like the neighboring village of Jerome, Leland Grove took its name from Jerome Leland, a prominent local farmer who hosted local events at a grove on his farm in the late 19th century. Much of the food served in Springfield&#x27;s Leland Hotel was grown on the Leland farm. The Leland farmhouse stood in Leland Grove until 2021, when it was demolished by its owner, Frank Vala. In 2022, the summer kitchen outbuilding from the farmhouse was moved from the site to Washington Park in Springfield.

In 1957, Leland Grove residents (known as &quot;Grovers&quot;) defeated a bid by the city of Springfield to annex their city. The question was put to a vote in both cities, and both city governments favored annexation. The outcome in Springfield was 5 to 1 in favor, but Grovers voted 3 to 1 against. After the vote, Springfield withdrew fire protection from Leland Grove, which was left without fire protection until 1959. Subsequent efforts by Springfield to annex Leland Grove and neighboring villages followed in 1960, 1971 and 1976, but were also unsuccessful.

For the first twenty years of its existence, Leland Grove did not have a police department. Initially traffic enforcement was handled by residents calling the city government to report if a delivery truck had violated traffic laws, and then a city officer would contact the delivery company to report the violation. In 1966, the city hired a private security agency. The city has maintained its own police force since 1970.

<text>Riverton is a village in Sangamon County, Illinois, United States. The population was 3,455 at the 2010 census, up from 3,062 in 2000. It is part of the Springfield, Illinois Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Riverton was founded by John Taylor in 1837. Originally named Judy&#x27;s Ferry for the ferry crossing the Sangamon River there, then Jamestown, after politician James Shields, the village was successful for about a decade, producing lumber for a planned railroad. When it was discovered that the railroad was badly constructed and unreliable, Jamestown fell into economic distress and the land on which it sat was sold.
The town was sold to Joseph Loose of Maryland, then again to John D. Keedy, a Springfield distiller. Land south of Jamestown was purchased and a distillery was put up. Yet again, the properties were lost, first mortgaged to Jacob Bunn, then given as a claim settlement to Parley L. Howlett, another distiller.
Jamestown was soon renamed Howlett, Shields had fallen from popularity, and a new flour mill and coal mine caused a short-lived boom. Despite their success, most of Howlett was sold to Jacob Bunn to pay off debt. Bunn started selling the lots to the residents, the only owner to do so. After a state requirement was passed preventing communities from being named after people, Howlett was rechristened as Riverton in the 1870s.
In 1876, train robber Jesse James spent a night in Riverton while en route to a bank heist in Minnesota. Al Capone also reportedly used Riverton as one of his hideouts. Riverton historically had a higher immigrant population than other small towns in the Springfield area due to the coal mining industry.

<doc id="111901" wikidata="Q3178559" url="?curid=111901" title="Stephen Pearl Andrews">
<text>Stephen Pearl Andrews (March 22, 1812 – May 21, 1886) was an American libertarian socialist, individualist anarchist, linguist, political philosopher, and outspoken abolitionist.

== Life ==

Andrews was born on March 22, 1812 in Templeton, Massachusetts. His father, Elisha Andrews, was a Baptist clergyman and revivalist. He graduated from the Classics department at Amherst College. He studied law and was admitted to the state bar in 1833. He moved to New Orleans where he became a wealthy lawyer and slaveowner. He was converted by abolitionism and became an abolitionist leader.

He moved to Houston, Texas in 1839. He was a prominent advocate for abolitionism in the Republic of Texas and an active member of the Liberty Party. Andrews was mobbed for his abolitionist rhetoric in Texas, prompting him to leave the state in 1843 for England. In England, he sought funds to buy slaves in the United States in order to free them.

By the end of the 1840s, Andrews began to focus his energies on utopian communities. Fellow individualist anarchist Josiah Warren was responsible for Andrew&#x27;s conversion to radical individualism and in 1851 they established Modern Times in Brentwood, New York. He was elected an Associate Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1846. In 1857, Andrews established the Unitary Homes on East 14 St. and Stuyvesant St. in New York City.

Andrews was a supporter of the woman suffrage movement.

== Thought ==

In the 1870s, Andrews promoted Joseph Rodes Buchanan&#x27;s psychometry besides his own universology predicting that a priori derived knowledge would supersede empirical science as exact science. Andrews was also considered a leader in the religious movement of spiritualism. Anarcho-syndicalist Rudolf Rocker called Andrews a significant exponent of libertarian socialism in the United States.

Andrews&#x27; individualist anarchism is a form of economic mutualism.

==Personal life==
In 1835, he married Mary Ann Gordon, with whom he had four children. He died at the residence of his son in New York City on May 21, 1886.

==History==
Shelbyville is the home of Josephine Garis Cochran who invented one of the first mechanical dishwashers ever built in 1886. It was exhibited at the 1893 Chicago Columbian Exposition, where it won &quot;the highest award.&quot;
Another Shelbyville invention, the first commercial pick-up baler, was designed and developed by Raymore McDonald, as conceived and financed by Horace M. Tallman and his two sons, Leslie and Gentry. These balers were marketed for many years by the Ann Arbor Machine Company of Shelbyville. This concept of field processing of farm forages made a significant contribution to the efficiency and economy of harvesting in the world&#x27;s agriculture. This basic field pick-up mechanism has been used in over 15 million balers. The American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers designated Shelbyville as an historical landmark of agricultural engineering, of which there are only 47 in the entire United States. Mr. Tallman&#x27;s home has been restored and is on the National Register of Historic Places. Located on West Main Street, the Tallman home is currently part of the Shelby Inn.

<text>Belleville is a city in and the county seat of St. Clair County, Illinois, United States. It is a southeastern suburb of St. Louis. The population was 42,404 at the 2020 census, making it the most populated city in the Metro East region of Greater St. Louis, and in all of Southern Illinois, south of Springfield. Due to its proximity to Scott Air Force Base, the city has a significant population of military and federal civilian personnel. It is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Belleville and home to the National Shrine of Our Lady of the Snows.

==History==
George Blair named the city of Belleville in 1814, after the French phrase &quot;belle ville&quot;, meaning &quot;beautiful city&quot;. Because Blair donated an acre of his land for the town square and an additional adjoining the square for the new county seat, the legislature transferred the county seat from the village of Cahokia. The latter had been established by French colonists as a mission village in the late 17th century.

Belleville was incorporated as a village in 1819, and became a city in 1850. Major immigration in the mid-19th century to this area occurred following revolutions in Germany, and most of the European-American population is of German ancestry. Many of the educated Germans fled their homeland after the failure of the German Revolution in 1848. Belleville was the center of the first important German settlement in Illinois. By 1870, an estimated 90% of the city&#x27;s population was either German-born or of German descent.

After the Civil War, Belleville became a manufacturing center producing nails, printing presses, gray iron castings, agricultural equipment, and stoves. Belleville became known as &quot;The Stove Capital of the World.&quot; The first brewery in Illinois was established in Belleville. In 1868, Gustav Goelitz founded the candy company that is known today as &quot;Jelly Belly.&quot;

An immense deposit () of bituminous coal was found in St. Clair County. By 1874, some farmers had become coal miners. One hundred shaft mines were in operation in and around Belleville. The coal brought the steam railroad to town, which allowed for the transport of many tons of coal to be shipped daily from Belleville to St. Louis on the west side of the Mississippi River, for use in its industries, homes and businesses. Later, Belleville had the first electric trolley in the state.

The first style of houses in Belleville were simple brick cottages, known locally as &quot;German street houses&quot; or &quot;row houses.&quot; Architectural styles flourished in greater variety, featuring American Foursquare, French Second Empire, Greek Revival, Gothic Revival, Italianate, Queen Anne, and Victorian. The Belleville Historic District, which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, comprises 73 contributing properties.

The &quot;Old Belleville Historic District,&quot; was defined and recognized in 1974 and is the city&#x27;s first historic district. The city also has designated two more historic districts: &quot;Hexenbuckel&quot; (est. in 1991) and &quot;Oakland&quot; (est. in 1995).

Belleville&#x27;s early German immigrants were educated, with most of them having graduated from German universities. They were nicknamed &quot;Latin Farmers&quot; because of this. After 1836 Gustav Koerner contributed to establish the city&#x27;s public library. The Belleville Public Library is the state&#x27;s oldest, predating the Illinois State Library by three years. The German settlers also founded choral and dramatic groups, as well as literary societies. They established one of the first kindergartens in the country here.

In 1990, as reported by the Belleville News-Democrat using the US Census data, the city surpassed the neighboring city of East St. Louis to become the most populated city in the Metro East and Southern Illinois.

The National Civic League recognized Belleville in 2011 as one of the ten recipients of the All-America City Award. Belleville is coterminous with the now defunct Belleville Township.
