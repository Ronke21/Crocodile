<text>Black Hawk Down is a 2001 war film directed and produced by Ridley Scott, and co-produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, from a screenplay by Ken Nolan. It is based on the 1999 eponymous non-fiction book by journalist Mark Bowden, about the crew of a Black Hawk helicopter that was shot down during the Battle of Mogadishu. The film features a large ensemble cast, including Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Eric Bana, Tom Sizemore, William Fichtner, Jason Isaacs, Sam Shepard, Jeremy Piven, Ioan Gruffudd, Ewen Bremner, Hugh Dancy, and Tom Hardy in his first film role. Orlando Bloom, Ty Burrell, and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau also have minor roles.

&quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; had a limited release on December 28, 2001, and went into the public on January 18, 2002. The film received positive reviews from film critics, although it was criticized for inaccuracies. The film performed modestly well at the box office, grossing $173 million worldwide against a production budget of $92 million. &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; won two Academy Awards for Best Film Editing and Best Sound at the 74th Academy Awards. In 2006, an extended cut of the film was released on DVD. The cut contains an additional eight minutes of footage, increasing the running time to 152 minutes. This extended cut was released on Blu-ray and in 4K on May 7, 2019.

==Plot==
In 1992 a famine in southern Somalia induced by the civil war leads the United Nations Security Council to authorize a military operation with a peacekeeping mandate. Conflict ensues between UNOSOM II and the Mogadishu-based militia loyal to Mohamed Farrah Aidid. In response, U.S. President Clinton deploys Task Force Ranger—consisting of 3rd Battalion/75th Ranger Regiment, Delta Force operators, and flight crew of the 160th SOAR—to Mogadishu to capture Aidid, who has proclaimed himself president. Aidid&#x27;s militia attacks a Red Cross food distribution shipment and steals the aid, but the Rangers are unable to respond due to the rules of engagement.

Outside Mogadishu, Rangers and Delta Force capture Osman Ali Atto, a faction leader selling arms to Aidid&#x27;s militia. The U.S. plans a mission to capture Omar Salad Elmi and Abdi Hassan Awale Qeybdiid, two of Aidid&#x27;s top advisers.

Prior to the mission, Staff Sergeant Matthew Eversmann receives his first command of Ranger Chalk Four after his lieutenant has a seizure. Members of his chalk include fresh 18-year-old Private First Class Todd Blackburn and Specialist John Grimes, a former desk clerk.

Delta Force operators capture Aidid&#x27;s advisers inside the target building while the Rangers and helicopters escorting the ground convoy take heavy fire from the rallying militia. Blackburn is severely injured when he falls from one of the Black Hawk helicopters, so three Humvees led by Staff Sergeant Jeff Struecker are detached from the convoy to return Blackburn to the UN-held Mogadishu Airport. Grimes is separated from Eversmann&#x27;s chalk after surviving an RPG explosion.

Just after Struecker&#x27;s column departs, Black Hawk &quot;Super Six-One&quot;, piloted by Chief Warrant Officer Clifton &quot;Elvis&quot; Wolcott, is shot down by a rocket-propelled grenade. Wolcott and his co-pilot are killed, two crew chiefs are wounded, and two Delta Force snipers on board escape in an MH-6 Little Bird helicopter.

The ground forces are rerouted to converge on the crash site. The militia erects roadblocks preventing Lieutenant Colonel Danny McKnight&#x27;s Humvee column from reaching the area, and inflicts heavy casualties. Meanwhile, two Ranger chalks, including Eversmann&#x27;s unit, reach the crash site and set up a defensive perimeter, while another helicopter, &quot;Super Six-Four&quot; piloted by Chief Warrant Officer Michael Durant, is also shot down by a rocket-propelled grenade and crashes several blocks away.

With the primary Ranger forces led by Captain Mike Steele pinned down and sustaining heavy casualties, no ground forces can reach &quot;Super Six-Four&quot; or reinforce the Rangers defending &quot;Super Six-One&quot;. Two Delta Force snipers, Sergeant First Class Randy Shughart and Master Sergeant Gary Gordon, volunteer to be inserted by helicopter to secure &quot;Super Six-Four&quot;″s crash site, where they find Durant still alive. Despite their heroic actions the site is overrun, Gordon and Shughart are killed, and Durant is captured.

McKnight&#x27;s column relinquishes their attempt to reach &quot;Six-One&quot;″s crash site and returns to base with the prisoners and their casualties. The men prepare to go back to extract the Rangers and fallen pilots, and Major General Garrison asks for reinforcements from the 10th Mountain Division, including Malaysian and Pakistani armored units from the U.N. coalition.

As night falls, Aidid&#x27;s militia launches a sustained assault on the trapped Americans at &quot;Super Six-One&quot;″s crash site. The militants are held off throughout the night by strafing runs and rocket attacks from AH-6J Little Bird helicopter gunships until the 10th Mountain Division&#x27;s relief column is able to reach the American soldiers. The wounded and casualties are evacuated in the vehicles, but a few Rangers and Delta Force soldiers are forced to run on foot from the crash site to reach the Safe Zone at Mogadishu Stadium.

A textual epilogue reveals Durant was released following 11 days of captivity; Gordon and Shugart became the first soldiers to receive the Medal of Honor posthumously since the Vietnam War, and General Garrison took full responsibility for the mission&#x27;s outcome, retiring the day after Aidid was killed in August 1996.

==Production==
===Development===
Adapting &quot;Black Hawk Down: a Story of Modern War&quot; (1999) by Mark Bowden was the idea of director Simon West, who suggested to Jerry Bruckheimer that he should buy the film rights and let West direct. West felt too tired after working on &quot;Lara Croft: Tomb Raider&quot; (2001), so he decided to drop out (West later said that he regretted the decision). Ridley Scott was hired to direct the film after he decided to not work on &quot;Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines&quot; (2003).

Ken Nolan was credited as screenwriter, and others contributed uncredited: Mark Bowden wrote an adaptation of his own book, Stephen Gaghan was hired to do a rewrite, Steven Zaillian and Ezna Sands rewrote the majority of Gaghan and Nolan&#x27;s work, actor Sam Shepard (MGen. Garrison) rewrote some of his own dialogue, and Eric Roth wrote Josh Hartnett and Eric Bana&#x27;s concluding speeches. Ken Nolan was on set for four months rewriting his script and the previous work by Gaghan, Zaillian, and Bowden. He was given sole screenwriting credit by a WGA committee.

The book relied on a dramatization of participant accounts, which were the basis of the movie. SPC John Stebbins was renamed as fictional &quot;John Grimes.&quot; Stebbins had been convicted by court martial in 1999 for the rape and forcible sodomy of his six-year-old daughter. Mark Bowden said the Pentagon, ever sensitive about public image, decided to alter factual history by requesting the change. Bowden wrote early screenplay drafts, before Bruckheimer gave it to screenwriter Nolan. The POW-captor conversation, between pilot Mike Durant and militiaman Firimbi, is from a Bowden script draft.

To keep the film at a manageable length, 100 key figures in the book were condensed to 39. The movie also does not feature any Somali actors. Additionally, no Somali consultants were hired for accuracy, according to writer Bowden.

For military verisimilitude, the Ranger actors took a one-week Ranger familiarization course at Fort Benning (now Fort Moore), the Delta Force actors took a two-week commando course from the 1st Special Warfare Training Group at Fort Bragg, and Ron Eldard and the actors playing 160th SOAR helicopter pilots were lectured by captured aviator Michael Durant at Fort Campbell.

The U.S. Army supplied the materiel and the helicopters from the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. Most pilots (e.g., Keith Jones, who speaks some dialogue) had participated in the historic battle on October 3–4, 1993.

On the last day of their week-long Army Ranger orientation at Fort Benning, the actors who portrayed the Rangers received letters slipped under their doors. It thanked them for their hard work, and asked them to &quot;tell our story true&quot;, signed with the names of the men who died in the Mogadishu firefight. A platoon of Rangers from B-3/75 did the fast-roping scenes and appeared as extras; John Collette, a Ranger Specialist during the battle, served as a stunt performer.

Many of the actors bonded with the soldiers who trained them for their roles. Actor Tom Sizemore said, &quot;What really got me at training camp was the Ranger Creed. I don&#x27;t think most of us can understand that kind of mutual devotion. It&#x27;s like having 200 best friends and every single one of them would die for you&quot;.

The film was originally set up at the Disney label Touchstone Pictures, but Disney boss Peter Schneider placed the film into turnaround, citing its subject matter that Disney never pleased well, and sell the project to Revolution Studios.

===Filming===
Filming began in March 2001 in Kénitra, Morocco, and concluded in late June.

Although the filmmakers considered filming in Jordan, they found the city of Amman too built up and landlocked. Scott and production designer Arthur Max subsequently turned to Morocco, where they had previously worked on &quot;Gladiator&quot;. Scott preferred that urban setting for authenticity. Most of the film was photographed in the cities of Rabat and Salé; the Task Force Ranger base sequences were filmed at Kénitra and Mehdya.

===Music===
The musical score for &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; was composed by Hans Zimmer, who previously collaborated with director Scott on several films including &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot; (1991) and &quot;Gladiator&quot; (2000). Zimmer developed the score through a collaboration with a variety of musicians that blended &quot;east African rhythms and sounds with a more conventional synthesizer approach.&quot; In doing so, Zimmer avoided a more traditional composition in favor of an experimental approach that would match the tone of the film. &quot;I wanted to do it like the way the movie was,&quot; said Zimmer. &quot;So I got myself a band together and we just went into my studio [...] and we&#x27;d just be flailing away at the picture, I mean, you know with great energy.&quot; A soundtrack album was released on January 15, 2002, by Decca Records.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; had a limited release in four theaters on December 28, 2001, in order to be eligible for the 2001 Oscars. It earned $179,823 in its first weekend, averaging $44,956 per theater. On January 11, 2002, the release expanded to 16 theaters and continued to do well with a weekly gross of $1,118,003 and an average daily per theater gross of $9,982. On January 18, 2002, the film had its wide release, opening at 3,101 theaters and earning $28,611,736 in its first wide-release weekend to finish first at the box office for the weekend. Opening on the Martin Luther King holiday, the film grossed $5,014,475 on the holiday of Monday, January 21, 2002, for a 4-day weekend total of $33,628,211. Only &quot;Titanic&quot; had previously grossed more money over the Martin Luther King holiday weekend. &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; finished first at the box office during its first three weeks of wide release. When the film closed on April 14, 2002, after its 15th week, it had grossed $108,638,746 domestically and $64,350,906 overseas for a worldwide total of $172,989,651.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; has an approval rating of 77% based on 175 reviews, with an average rating of 7.00/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Though it&#x27;s light on character development and cultural empathy, &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; is a visceral, pulse-pounding portrait of war, elevated by Ridley Scott&#x27;s superb technical skill.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 74 out of 100, based on reviews from 33 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four stars out of four, saying that films like this &quot;help audiences understand and sympathize with the actual experiences of combat troops, instead of trivializing them into entertainments.&quot; &quot;Empire&quot; magazine said that, though &quot;ambitious, sumptuously framed, and frenetic, &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; is nonetheless a rare find of a war movie which dares to turn genre convention on its head&quot;. Mike Clark of &quot;USA Today&quot; wrote that the film &quot;extols the sheer professionalism of America&#x27;s elite Delta Force—even in the unforeseen disaster that was 1993&#x27;s Battle of Mogadishu,&quot; and praised Scott&#x27;s direction: &quot;in relating the conflict, in which 18 Americans died and 70-plus were injured, the standard getting-to-know-you war-film characterizations are downplayed. While some may regard this as a shortcoming, it is, in fact, a virtue&quot;.

The film has had a small cultural legacy, which has been studied academically by media analysts dissecting how media reflects American perceptions of war. &quot;Newsweek&quot; writer Evan Thomas considered the movie one of the most culturally significant films of the George W. Bush presidency. He suggested that, although the film was presented as being anti-war, it was at its core pro-war: &quot;though it depicted a shameful defeat, the soldiers were heroes willing to die for their brothers in arms ... The movie showed brutal scenes of killing, but also courage, stoicism and honor ... The overall effect was stirring, if slightly pornographic, and it seemed to enhance the desire of Americans for a thumping war to avenge 9/11.&quot;

Stephen A. Klien, writing in &quot;Critical Studies in Media Communication,&quot; argued that the film&#x27;s sensational rendering of war encouraged audiences to empathize with the film&#x27;s pro-soldier leitmotif, to &quot;conflate personal support of American soldiers with support of American military policy,&quot; and to discourage &quot;critical public discourse concerning justification for and execution of military interventionist policy.&quot;

In a review featured in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, film critic Elvis Mitchell expressed dissatisfaction with the film&#x27;s &quot;lack of characterization&quot; and opined that the film &quot;reeks of glumly staged racism&quot;. Owen Gleiberman and Sean Burns, the film critics for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and the alternative newspaper &quot;Philadelphia Weekly&quot;, respectively, echoed the sentiment that the depiction was racist. American film critic Wheeler Winston Dixon also found the film&#x27;s &quot;absence of motivation and characterization&quot; disturbing, and wrote that while American audiences might find the film to be a &quot;paean to patriotism&quot;, other audiences might find it to be a &quot;deliberately hostile enterprise&quot;; nevertheless, Dixon lauded the film&#x27;s &quot;spectacular display of pyrotechnics coupled with equally adroit editing.&quot; Jerry Bruckheimer, the film&#x27;s producer, rejected these criticisms on &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot;, putting them down to political correctness in part due to Hollywood&#x27;s liberal leanings.

===Accolades===
&quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; received four Academy Award nominations for Best Director (lost to &quot;A Beautiful Mind&quot;) and Best Cinematography (lost to &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;) and won two Oscars for Best Sound and Best Film Editing. It received three BAFTA Award nominations for Best Cinematography, Best Sound and Best Editing.

==Historicity==
In a radio interview, Brendan Sexton, who portrayed Ranger Richard &quot;Alphabet&quot; Kowalewski, said that the version that made it onto theater screens significantly differed from the one recounted in the original script. According to him, many scenes asking hard questions of the US regarding the violent realities of war and the true purpose of their mission in Somalia were cut.

The film begins with the quote &quot;Only the dead have seen the end of war.&quot;, which is misattributed to Plato. This line first appeared in the works of George Santayana.

===Depiction of Somalis===
Soon after &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;″s release, the Somali Justice Advocacy Center (SJAC) in California denounced what they felt was its brutal and dehumanizing depiction of Somalis and called for its boycott. The SJAC in Minnesota called for a boycott of the film for its portrayal of Somalis as &quot;savage beasts shooting each other.&quot; No Somali actors were used in the movie. Somalis attending a screening of a pirated copy of the film at a theater in Mogadishu said the film ignored the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands, of civilian adults and children caused by the Americans.

In an interview with the BBC, the faction leader Osman Ali Atto said that many aspects of the film are factually incorrect. Taking exception to the ostentatious depiction of his character, Ali Atto claimed he looks nothing like the actor who portrayed him, nor that he smoked cigars or wore earrings. These details were later confirmed by SEAL Team Six sniper Howard E. Wasdin in his 2012 memoirs. Wasdin also indicated that while the character in the movie ridiculed his captors, in reality, Atto seemed concerned that Wasdin and his men had been sent to kill rather than apprehend him. Atto additionally stated that he had not been consulted about the project, nor was he approached for permission to use his likeness, and that the film sequence re-enacting his arrest contained several inaccuracies:

Wasdin also remarked that while olive green military rigger&#x27;s tape was used to mark the roof of the car in question in the movie, his team in actuality managed to track down Atto&#x27;s whereabouts using a much more sophisticated technique involving the implantation of a homing device. This was hidden in a cane presented to Atto as a gift from a contact who routinely met with him, which eventually led the team directly to the faction leader.

===Uncredited UN troops===
Retired Malaysian Army Brigadier-General Abdul Latif Ahmad, who at the time commanded Malaysian forces in Mogadishu, told the AFP news agency that Malaysian moviegoers would be under the erroneous impression that the real battle was fought by the Americans alone, with Malaysian troops relegated to serving as &quot;mere bus drivers to ferry them out&quot;.

General Pervez Musharraf, who later became President of Pakistan after a coup, similarly accused the filmmakers of not crediting the work done by the Pakistani soldiers. In his autobiography &quot;In the Line of Fire: A Memoir&quot;, Musharraf wrote:

===Mogadishu Mile===
It is often believed that the soldiers involved in the Mogadishu Mile had to run all the way to the Mogadiscio Stadium, as shown in the film. However, in that scene the filmmakers took artistic license and dramatized the event, departing from the book. In the film, the Mogadishu Mile ends with about a dozen soldiers entering the Mogadiscio Stadium having run all the way through the city. In the book, it ends with soldiers reaching a rendezvous point on National Street (in the opposite direction from the stadium):

<text>Kom Ombo (; Coptic: or ; Ancient Greek: or ; or and ) is an agricultural town in Egypt famous for the Temple of Kom Ombo. It was originally an Egyptian city called Nubt, meaning City of Gold (not to be confused with the city north of Naqada that was also called Nubt/Ombos). Nubt is also known as or (). It became a Greek settlement during the Greco-Roman Period. The town&#x27;s location on the Nile, north of Aswan (Syene), gave it some control over trade routes from Nubia to the Nile Valley, but its main rise to prominence came with the erection of the Temple of Kom Ombo in the 2nd century BC.

==History==

In antiquity the city was in the Thebaid, the capital of the Nomos Ombites, on the east bank of the Nile; latitude north. Ombos was a garrison town under every dynasty of Egypt as well as the Ptolemaic Kingdom and Roman Egypt, and was celebrated for the magnificence of its temples and its hereditary feud with the people of Dendera.

Ombos was the first city below Aswan at which any remarkable remains of antiquity occur. The Nile, indeed, at this portion of its course, was ill-suited to a dense population in antiquity. It runs between steep and narrow banks of sandstone, and deposits but little of its fertilizing slime upon the dreary and barren shores. There are two temples at Ombos, constructed of the stone obtained from the neighboring quarries of Hagar Silsilah.

The more magnificent of two stands upon the top of a sandy hill, and appears to have been a species of Pantheon, since, according to extant inscriptions, it was dedicated to Haroeris and the other deities of the Ombite nome by the soldiers quartered there. The smaller temple to the northwest was sacred to the goddess Isis. Both, indeed, are of an imposing architecture, and still retain the brilliant colors with which their builders adorned them. However, they are from the Ptolemaic Kingdom, with the exception of a doorway of sandstone, built into a wall of brick. This was part of a temple built by Thutmose III in honor of the crocodile-headed god Sobek. The monarch is represented on tress, the doorjambs, holding the measuring reed and chisel, the emblems of construction, and in the act of dedicating the temple.

The Ptolemaic portions of the larger temple present an exception to an almost universal rule in Egyptian architecture. It has no propylon or dromos in front of it, and the portico has an uneven number of columns, in all fifteen, arranged in a triple row. Of these columns, thirteen are still erect. As there are two principal entrances, the temple would seem to be two united in one, strengthening the supposition that it was the Pantheon of the Ombite nome. On a cornice above the doorway of one of the adyta, there is a Greek inscription, recording the erection, or perhaps the restoration of the sekos by Ptolemy VI Philometor and his sister-wife Cleopatra II, 180-145 BCE. The hill on which the Ombite temples stand has been considerably excavated at its base by the river, which here strongly inclines to the Arabian bank.

The crocodile was held in especial honor by the people of Ombos; and in the adjacent catacombs are occasionally found mummies of the sacred animal. Juvenal, in his 15th satire, has given a lively description of a fight, of which he was an eye-witness, between the Ombitae and the inhabitants of Dendera, who were hunters of the crocodile. On this occasion the men of Ombos had the worst of it; and one of their number, having stumbled in his flight, was caught and eaten by the Denderites. The satirist, however, has represented Ombos as nearer to Dendera than it actually is, these towns, in fact, being nearly from each other. The Roman coins of the Ombite nome exhibit the crocodile and the effigy of the crocodile-headed god Sobek.

In Kom Ombo there is a rare engraved image of what is thought to be the first representation of medical instruments for performing surgery, including scalpels, curettes, forceps, dilator, scissors and medicine bottles dating from the days of Roman Egypt.

At this site there is another Nilometer used to measure the level of the river waters. On the opposite side of the Nile was a suburb of Ombos, called Contra-Ombos.

The city was the seat of a bishop during Late Antiquity. Two bishops of Omboi are known by name, Silbanos (before 402) and Verses (402). Under the name Ombi, it is included in the Catholic Church&#x27;s list of titular sees. Karol Wojtyła (the future Pope John Paul II) was titular bishop of Ombi from 1958 until 1963, when he was appointed Archbishop of Kraków.

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===
The Köppen climate classification classifies its climate as hot desert (BWh).

==Today==
Today, irrigated sugarcane and cereal account for most of the agricultural industry.

Most of the 60,000 villagers are native Egyptians, although there is a large population of Nubians, including many Magyarabs who were displaced from their land upon the creation of Lake Nasser.

In 2010, plans to construct a new $700m solar power plant near the city were unveiled by the Egyptian government.

<text>Ordinary People is a 1980 American drama film directed by Robert Redford in his feature directorial debut. The screenplay by Alvin Sargent is based on the 1976 novel by Judith Guest. The film follows the disintegration of a wealthy family in Lake Forest, Illinois, following the accidental death of one of their two sons and the attempted suicide of the other. It stars Donald Sutherland, Mary Tyler Moore, Judd Hirsch, and Timothy Hutton.

&quot;Ordinary People&quot; was released theatrically on September 19, 1980, by Paramount Pictures to critical and commercial success. Reviewers praised Redford&#x27;s direction, Sargent&#x27;s screenplay, and the performances of the cast. The film, which grossed $90 million on a $6.2 million budget, was chosen by the National Board of Review as one of the top ten films of 1980, and garnered six nominations at the 53rd Academy Awards, winning four: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor for Hutton (the youngest recipient at age 20). In addition, the film won five awards at the 38th Golden Globe Awards: Best Motion Picture – Drama, Best Director, Best Actress (Moore), Best Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor (Hutton).

==Plot==
The Jarretts are an upper-middle-class family in Lake Forest, a wealthy suburb north of Chicago. They are trying to return to normal life after experiencing the accidental death of their older teenage son, Buck, and the attempted suicide of their younger and surviving son, Conrad. Conrad has recently returned home after spending four months in a psychiatric hospital. He feels alienated from his friends and family and seeks help from a psychiatrist, Dr. Tyrone Berger, who discovers that Conrad was involved in the sailing accident that caused Buck&#x27;s death. Conrad is now dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder and is seeking help to cope with his emotions.

Conrad&#x27;s father, Calvin, attempts to connect with his surviving son and understand his wife, while Conrad&#x27;s mother, Beth, denies her loss, hoping to maintain her composure and restore her family to what it once was. She appears to have favored her older son and has grown cold toward Conrad due to his suicide attempt. Beth is determined to maintain the appearance of perfection and normality, and her efforts only serve to alienate Conrad further. Conrad works with Dr. Berger and begins to learn how to deal with his emotions rather than control them. He starts dating a fellow student, Jeannine, who helps him regain a sense of optimism. However, Conrad still struggles to communicate and establish normal relationships with his parents and schoolmates.

Beth and Conrad often argue while Calvin tries to referee, generally taking Conrad&#x27;s side for fear of pushing him over the edge again. Tensions escalate near Christmas when Conrad becomes furious at Beth for not wanting to take a photo with him, swearing at her in front of his grandparents. Afterwards, Beth discovers Conrad has been lying about his after-school whereabouts. This leads to a heated confrontation between Conrad and Beth in which Conrad points out that Beth never visited him in the hospital; Conrad argues that if Buck had been hospitalized in his place, she would have gone to see him, to which Beth curtly replies that Buck would never have been in the hospital in the first place. Beth and Calvin take a trip to see Beth&#x27;s brother Ward in Houston, where Calvin presses Beth about her evasive attitude.

Conrad suffers a setback when he learns that Karen, a friend from the psychiatric hospital, has committed suicide. A cathartic breakthrough session in the middle of the night with Dr. Berger allows Conrad to stop blaming himself for Buck&#x27;s death and accept his mother&#x27;s frailties. However, when Conrad tries to show affection, Beth is unresponsive, leading Calvin to emotionally confront her one last time. He questions their love and asks whether she is capable of truly loving anyone. Stunned, Beth packs her bags and goes back to Houston. Calvin and Conrad are left to come to terms with their new family situation, affirming their father-son love.

===Casting===
Gene Hackman was originally cast as Calvin Jarrett but then later dropped out when he and the studio could not come to a financial agreement.

A then-unknown Michael J. Fox, who had just moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career, auditioned for the role of Conrad Jarrett but reportedly did not impress Redford, who flossed his teeth during Fox&#x27;s audition.

Natalie Wood was also considered for the role of Beth.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was a box-office success, grossing $54.8 million in the United States and Canada and approximately $36 million overseas for a worldwide gross of $90 million.

===Critical reception===
&quot;Ordinary People&quot; received critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 90%, based on 105 reviews, with an average rating of 8.50/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Robert Redford proves himself a filmmaker of uncommon emotional intelligence with &quot;Ordinary People&quot;, an auspicious debut that deftly observes the fractioning of a family unit through a quartet of superb performances.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave it a full four stars and praised how the film&#x27;s setting &quot;is seen with an understated matter-of-factness. There are no cheap shots against suburban lifestyles or affluence or mannerisms: The problems of the people in this movie aren&#x27;t caused by their milieu, but grow out of themselves. ... That&#x27;s what sets the film apart from the sophisticated suburban soap opera it could easily have become.&quot; He later named it the fifth best film of the year 1980; while colleague Gene Siskel ranked it the second best film of 1980.

Writing for &quot;The New York Times,&quot; Vincent Canby called it &quot;a moving, intelligent and funny film about disasters that are commonplace to everyone except the people who experience them.&quot;

The film marked a career breakout for Mary Tyler Moore from the personalities of her other two famous roles: Laura Petrie on &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot; and Mary Richards on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;. Moore&#x27;s nuanced portrayal of the mother to Hutton&#x27;s character was highly acclaimed, and earned her a Best Actress nomination. Donald Sutherland&#x27;s performance as the father was also well received and earned him a Golden Globe nomination. Despite his co-stars receiving nominations, Sutherland was overlooked for an Academy Award, which &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; has described as one of the biggest acting snubs in the history of the awards.

Judd Hirsch&#x27;s portrayal of Dr. Berger was a departure from his work on the sitcom &quot;Taxi&quot;, and drew praise from many in the psychiatric community as one of the rare times their profession is shown in a positive light in film. Hirsch was also nominated for Best Supporting Actor, losing out to co-star Hutton. Additionally, &quot;Ordinary People&quot; launched the career of Elizabeth McGovern who played Hutton&#x27;s character&#x27;s love interest, and who received special permission to film while attending Juilliard.

The film&#x27;s prominent usage of Pachelbel&#x27;s &quot;Canon&quot;, which had been relatively obscure for centuries, helped to usher the piece into mainstream popular culture.

===Analysis===
Julia L. Hall, a journalist who has written extensively about narcissistic personality disorder, wrote in 2017 upon Moore&#x27;s death that she &quot;portrays her character&#x27;s narcissism to a tee in turn after turn.&quot; She praised Moore for taking such a career risk so soon after having played such a memorable and likable character on television, &quot;scaffolding gaping emptiness with a persona of perfection, supported by denial, blame, rejection, and rage.&quot;

==Accolades==
The film was nominated for six Academy Awards (winning four), including the Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor (for Hutton) in his first film role.

== Home media ==
&quot;Ordinary People&quot; was released on DVD in 2001. It was released on Blu-ray in March 2022, featuring a 4K restoration of the film.

<doc id="106337" wikidata="Q1285467" url="?curid=106337" title="Coal Miner's Daughter (film)">
<text>Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter is a 1980 American biographical musical film directed by Michael Apted and written by Tom Rickman. It follows the story of country music singer Loretta Lynn from her early teen years in a poor family and getting married at 15 to her rise as one of the most influential country musicians. Based on Lynn&#x27;s 1976 biography of the same name by George Vecsey, the film stars Sissy Spacek as Lynn. Tommy Lee Jones, Beverly D&#x27;Angelo and Levon Helm are featured in supporting roles. Ernest Tubb, Roy Acuff, and Minnie Pearl make cameo appearances as themselves.

A film on Lynn&#x27;s life was intended to be made since the release of the biography. Production for the film began in March 1979, and Lynn herself chose Spacek to portray her on screen after seeing a photograph of her, despite being unfamiliar with her films. The film&#x27;s soundtrack featured all of Lynn&#x27;s hit singles, which were all sung by Spacek, as well as Patsy Cline&#x27;s &quot;Sweet Dreams&quot; sung by D&#x27;Angelo and Cline&#x27;s &quot;Back in Baby&#x27;s Arms&quot; sung by Spacek and D&#x27;Angelo in a duet. The soundtrack reached the top 40 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; chart and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.

Universal Pictures released &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot; theatrically on March 7, 1980. The critical consensus on Rotten Tomatoes calls it &quot;a solidly affecting story&quot;. The film grossed $67.18 million in North America against a budget of $15 million, becoming the seventh highest-grossing film of 1980. The film received seven nominations at the 53rd Academy Awards, including for Best Picture, with Spacek winning Best Actress. At the 38th Golden Globe Awards, it garnered four nominations and won two; Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy and Best Actress (for Spacek).

The film is considered &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and was selected to be preserved in the United States National Film Registry in 2019.

==Plot==
In 1945, 13-year-old Loretta Webb is one of eight children of Ted Webb, a Van Lear coal miner raising a family with his wife in the midst of grinding poverty in Butcher Hollow, Kentucky (pronounced by locals as &quot;Butcher Holler&quot;).

In 1948, at the age of 15, Loretta marries 22-year-old Oliver &quot;Mooney&quot; (aka Doo, short for Doolittle) Lynn, becoming a mother of four by the time she is 19. The family moves to northern Washington State, where Doo works in the forest industry and Loretta sings occasionally at local honky-tonks on weekends. After some time, Loretta makes an occasional appearance on local radio.

By the time Loretta turns 25, Norm Burley, the owner of Zero Records, a small Canadian record label, hears Loretta sing during one of her early radio appearances. Burley gives the couple the money needed to travel to Los Angeles to cut a demo tape from which her first single, &quot;I&#x27;m a Honky Tonk Girl&quot;, is made. After returning home from the sessions, Doo suggests he and Loretta go on a promotional tour to push the record. Doo shoots his own publicity photo for Loretta, and spends many late nights writing letters to show promoters and to radio disc jockeys all over the South. After Loretta receives an emergency phone call from her mother telling her that her father had died, she and Doo hit the road with records, photos, and their children. The two embark on an extensive promotional tour of radio stations across the South.

En route, and unbeknownst to the couple, Loretta&#x27;s first single, &quot;I&#x27;m a Honky Tonk Girl&quot;, hits the charts based on radio and jukebox plays, and earns her a spot on the Grand Ole Opry. In the summer of 1961, after 17 straight weekly performances on the Opry, she is invited to sing at Ernest Tubb Record Shop&#x27;s Midnite Jamboree after her performance that night. Country superstar Patsy Cline, one of Loretta&#x27;s idols, who had recently been hospitalized from a near-fatal car wreck, inspires Loretta to dedicate Patsy&#x27;s newest hit &quot;I Fall to Pieces&quot; to the singer herself as a musical get-well card. Cline listens to the broadcast that night from her hospital room and sends her husband Charlie Dick to Ernest Tubb Record Shop to fetch Loretta so the two can meet. A close friendship with Cline follows, which is abruptly ended by Cline&#x27;s death in a plane crash on March 5, 1963.

The next few years are a whirlwind. The stress of extensive touring, keeping up her image, overwork, and trying to keep her marriage and family together cause Loretta a nervous breakdown, which she suffers onstage at the beginning of a concert. After a year off at her ranch in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee, Loretta goes back on the road, returning to establish herself as the &quot;First Lady of Country Music&quot;.

The film closes with Loretta recounting the story of her life through her 1970 hit song &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot; to a sold-out audience.

==Cast==
==Production==
Lynn chose Spacek to portray her, making the decision based on a photograph of the actress despite being unfamiliar with her films, a story Spacek recounts in a DVD audio commentary for the collector&#x27;s edition of the film. Initially, Spacek was reluctant to participate, and asked to do her own singing in the film in hopes of scaring the studio from pursuing her for the role. At the time that Lynn prematurely announced on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; that &quot;Sissy Spacek is going to play me,&quot; the actress was torn between friends who advised her to do Lynn&#x27;s film and those who advised her to choose instead a Nicolas Roeg project due to start filming at the same time. Talking it over with her mother-in-law that evening, Spacek was advised to pray for a sign, which she did. She and her husband subsequently went for a drive in his mother&#x27;s car, where the radio was tuned to a classical music station that changed formats at sunset every evening. As the couple pulled out of the parking garage, the title line of the song &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot; came from the radio.

In her 2012 memoir &quot;My Extraordinary Ordinary Life&quot;, Sissy Spacek states that she became fast friends with Loretta Lynn and worked to emulate her unique accent and speech patterns by spending an afternoon tape-recording the singer while she told stories of her life, some of which made it into the script. She then listened to the tapes and repeated the lines until she captured her own version of Lynn. Though Spacek had started out as a singer, the producers considered dubbing Loretta&#x27;s vocals over her performance. Lynn encouraged them to allow Spacek to do all of her own singing in the film and helped the actress learn to sing and play guitar in her style. The film&#x27;s soundtrack featured Spacek&#x27;s singing all of Lynn&#x27;s hits sung in the movie, including &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot;.

The locations included Blackey, Eolia, Flatgap, Bottom Fork, Redfox in Knott and Letcher Counties in Kentucky; and Pardee, a former coal camp on the Virginia side of Black Mountain. Interiors of Lynn&#x27;s childhood home were shot in a warehouse in Norton, Virginia. Scenes were also shot in Loretta Lynn&#x27;s Madison, Tennessee, home on Barbara Drive.

The replica of Lynn&#x27;s home in Butcher Hollow, built at Bottom Fork, Letcher County, Kentucky, was burned by arsonists. It was on the front porch of that house that Levon Helm, drummer and singer of the rock group The Band, made his acting debut as Lynn&#x27;s father.

In an interview with Merv Griffin broadcast on November 7, 1978, Loretta Lynn said that Harrison Ford had been originally cast.

==Historical inaccuracies== 
The film emphasizes Lynn&#x27;s self-fabricated myth that she got married at the age of 13. The myth went uncontested until May 2012, when the Associated Press unearthed her Kentucky birth certificate, revealing that Lynn was actually almost 16 at the time of her marriage and had been peddling a lie for decades. When contacted by the AP before the exposé went to publication, Lynn&#x27;s spokeswoman declined comment. The discrepancy is significant as it alters the narrative Lynn spun in books and other public forums. In reality, it would have been illegal for a girl under the age of 15 to marry in Kentucky.

There are other events depicted in the film that are contrary to actual facts:
*Patsy Cline never owned a tour bus, although she had thought about purchasing one shortly before her death.
*Cline&#x27;s plane crash did not occur early in the morning as the DJ on the radio in Lynn&#x27;s bedroom stated; it happened shortly after 6:00 in the evening.
*&quot;You Ain&#x27;t Woman Enough (To Take My Man)&quot; was not inspired by one of Mooney&#x27;s cheating episodes, which was caught by Lynn while touring with Cline, as the film suggests. The inspiration came from a fan of Lynn, whom she met backstage. The fan told Lynn how another woman had been trying to steal her husband from her, to which Lynn replied, &quot;Why she ain&#x27;t woman enough to take your man,&quot; instantly giving Lynn an idea for a song title. Also, the film portrayed Lynn singing the song to Cline while writing it; the song was not recorded until late 1965, nearly three years after Cline&#x27;s death; so it was likely that Lynn didn&#x27;t write the song (and met the fan who inspired it) until after Cline&#x27;s death as well.
*In the film, just before Cline&#x27;s death, Lynn tells her she is pregnant with twins; given this is the last time they see each other, this would have happened February to March 1963. Lynn&#x27;s twin daughters were in fact born August 6, 1964, roughly 17 months after Cline&#x27;s death.

==Soundtrack==
Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack was released on March 7, 1980, under the MCA Nashville label. It included music by Beverly D&#x27;Angelo, Levon Helm, and Sissy Spacek except for the &quot;End Credits Medley&quot; and material by other artists that were not under contract to MCA.
The album was certified Gold by the RIAA on January 11, 1982 and has been released on vinyl, cassette tape, and CD. Levon Helm&#x27;s &quot;Blue Moon of Kentucky&quot; was released as a single on 7-inch vinyl, both as a double-A-side and also with Allen Toussaint&#x27;s &quot;Working in the Coal Mine&quot;, a non-album track also sung by Helm, on the B-side. The soundtrack would win Country Music Association Award for Album of the Year in 1980, the first of only two soundtracks to do so. (&quot;O Brother, Where Art Thou?&quot; would be the other in 2001.)

==Reception==
===Box office===
In its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot; was number 1 at the box office, grossing $3.6 million in 796 theaters.

===Critical response===

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot; holds an approval rating of 86% based on 63 reviews, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;Like a classic traditional country song, &quot;Coal Miner&#x27;s Daughter&quot; draws on time-tested formula -- and undeniable talent -- to tell a solidly affecting story.&quot; On Metacritic, which assigns a rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 87 out of 100, based on 47 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

&quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;a thoughtful, endearing film charting the life of singer Loretta Lynn from the depths of poverty in rural Kentucky to her eventual rise to the title of &#x27;queen of country music.&#x27;&quot; Roger Ebert from &quot;The Chicago Times&quot; stated that the film &quot;has been made with great taste and style; it&#x27;s more intelligent and observant than movie biographies of singing stars used to be.&quot;

<doc id="106338" wikidata="Q1188991" url="?curid=106338" title="North American Airlines">
<text>North American Airlines, Inc., was an American airline with its headquarters at the HLH Building in Peachtree City, Georgia in Greater Atlanta, United States. Prior to May 2008, it operated scheduled international services from the U.S. to Africa and Guyana. Later it operated domestic and international charter services and wet lease services. Its main aircraft and maintenance base was Tampa International Airport.

==History==
North American Airlines was a subsidiary of Global Aviation Holdings, Inc., formerly Global Aero Logistics, Inc. Unlike the other airlines that are or were a part of Global Aviation, ATA Airlines (now defunct) and World Airways (now defunct), North American was founded after airline deregulation in the United States.

North American was established in 1989 and began operations on January 20, 1990. It was founded by Dan McKinnon, former head of the then-Civil Aeronautics Board. The airline was acquired by World Air Holdings in April 2005.

It began by flying charter flights on Boeing 757 aircraft. The company grew during the 1990s, adding flights to San Juan, Puerto Rico, various spots in Mexico and other destinations. North American also started a scheduled flight from Los Angeles International Airport to JFK to complement El Al&#x27;s existing Tel Aviv-JFK-LAX run and provide the Israeli airline with more passengers. North American also opened operations in Newark, New Jersey, and Oakland, California, at that time. In addition to their original 757s, North American also operated Boeing 767s for long-range, high-density charter flights. 

On April 5, 2007, New ATA Holdings, Inc., bought out North American Airlines parent company World Air Holdings, Inc. and promptly changed the name of the holding company to Global Aero Logistics, Inc. to reflect the worldwide desires of the latest owners. The same firm, MatlinPatterson had recently divested themselves of Varig at the end of March 2006, although they still maintained financial interests at its former cargo subsidiary VarigLog (LC). The company was renamed Global Aviation Holdings, Inc., on Feb. 26, 2009. 

North American shut down in March 2014 for bankruptcy reasons.

Announced on February 19, 2008, North American Airlines planned on discontinuing all scheduled service in May 2008 in favor of concentrating on charter operations. According to a news release on northamericanair.com, &quot;What makes NAA&#x27;s scheduled service operations untenable is the rising cost of fuel, with jet fuel costs increasing 60 percent since 2005. This was a difficult decision, especially in light of the continuing support we have received from the governments and the traveling public in these markets. NAA&#x27;s modern Boeing 757/767 fleet is in high demand and NAA will redeploy these aircraft profitably in the charter market&quot;.

North American Airlines discontinued service to Hawaii as of September 1, 2005. Prior to Delta Air Lines establishing service between New York City and Accra, Ghana, on December 11, 2006, NAA&#x27;s New York-Accra and Baltimore-Banjul services were the only scheduled non-stop service between the U.S. and West Africa operated by a U.S. airline for several years. .

Earlier scheduled service included Aguadilla in Puerto Rico, Santiago and Santo Domingo in Dominican Republic. Each of these routes was canceled after JetBlue Airways began competing on these routes. According to conversations with Dan McKinnon and Steve Harfst (former COO), there was no desire for the company to compete with the low fare cost structure of JetBlue.

===Charters===
North American&#x27;s charter operations made up the bulk of its business: resorts such as Club Med and tour operators in Hawaii and the Caribbean chartered North American&#x27;s aircraft on a regular basis. Since discontinuing all scheduled service in May 2008, North American Airlines continued to operate until 2014 as solely a charter airline.

==Fleet==
As of March 2014, the North American Airlines fleet included 6 aircraft:

As of May 2013, the average fleet age of North American Airlines was 18.1 years.

==Services==
As a certified United States Department of Defense air carrier, NAA provided military personnel and their dependents air transportation to destinations not served by commercial airlines. North American was the first airline to provide the capability of the Boeing 767 aircraft to the United States Military in 2002. NAA operated military transport flights out of Dallas/Ft. Worth Airport and other locations.

The carrier maintained a long-standing wet lease relationship with Air Jamaica, providing wet-leased 767 aircraft and crew for the airline&#x27;s Kingston-New York service. In the summer of 2007, Air Jamaica increased its dependence on North American Airlines&#x27; services as the Jamaican company struggled to cope with higher-than-expected demand.

North American Airlines also operated charter cargo service to Gibraltar in co-operation with the Odyssey Marine Exploration.

North American Airlines also served as then Senator Barack Obama&#x27; campaign carrier, flying him, his staff and the press through Election Day. When he was named the Democratic nominee, the aircraft, a Boeing 757, underwent a major overhaul. The interior was fitted with 4 captains chairs, a table with seating for 4, as well as 16 business class seats for staff. In addition, the exterior was repainted with the campaign logo and slogan &quot;Change We Can Believe In&quot;.

<doc id="106339" wikidata="Q623065" url="?curid=106339" title="Dagon">
<text>Dagon (, &quot;Dāgōn&quot;) or Dagan (; ) was a god worshipped in ancient Syria across the middle of the Euphrates, with primary temples located in Tuttul and Terqa, though many attestations of his cult come from cities such as Mari and Emar as well. In settlements situated in the upper Euphrates area, he was regarded as the &quot;father of gods&quot; similar to Mesopotamian Enlil or Hurrian Kumarbi, as well as a lord of the land, a god of prosperity, and a source of royal legitimacy. A large number of theophoric names, both masculine and feminine, attests that he was a popular deity. He was also worshiped further east, in Mesopotamia, where many rulers regarded him as the god capable of granting them kingship over the western areas.

Attestations of Dagan from coastal areas are much less frequent and come mostly from the northern city of Ugarit, where Dagan&#x27;s cult had a limited scope. According to the Hebrew Bible, Dagan was also the national god of the Philistines, with temples at Ashdod and Gaza, but there is no extrabiblical evidence confirming this. The extrasolar object designated Fomalhaut b is named after Dagon.

==Etymology==
Multiple origins have been proposed for Dagan&#x27;s name.

According to Philo of Byblos, the Phoenician author Sanchuniathon explained &quot;Dagon&quot; as a word for &quot;grain&quot; (). Historian Manfred Hutter considers it possible that the god&#x27;s name derives from the root *&quot;dgn&quot; (to be cloudy), which he interprets as a sign that he was originally a weather god. However, the notion of Dagan being a weather god is rejected by most researchers of this deity (see the &quot;Dagan and weather gods&quot; section below).

Lluís Feliu in his monograph &quot;The God Dagan in Bronze Age Syria&quot; rejects both of these theories and concludes that Dagan&#x27;s name originated in a pre-Semitic language spoken in inland Syria. This theory is supported by Alfonso Archi as well. Multiple other ancient Syrian deities are regarded as originating in such a substratum, including Aštabi, Ishara and Kubaba.

The association with a Hebrew word for &quot;fish&quot; (as in , Tib. ) in medieval exegesis has led to an incorrect interpretation of Dagan as a fish god.

== Divine genealogy and syncretism ==
No known text deals with the parentage or creation of Dagan. His wife was Shalash; while well attested in Tuttul and elsewhere, she is seemingly absent in sources pertaining to Dagan&#x27;s cult in Terqa. Their children were Hadad (analogous to Ugaritic Baal) and possibly Hebat, who is attested alongside Dagan and Shalash in a mourning ritual from ancient Aleppo. Daniel Schwemer considers it possible that Dagan, while always viewed as a &quot;father of gods,&quot; only became the father of the weather god under Hurrian influence.

While Wilfred G. Lambert proposed in 1980 that Ishara was sometimes regarded as the wife of Dagan, and this theory is repeated as fact in older reference works such as Jeremy Black&#x27;s and Anthony Green&#x27;s &quot;Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia&quot;, it is no longer considered the consensus. Lluís Feliu in his study of Dagan concludes that the association between these two deities was limited to sharing temples in Mesopotamia, and was most likely based on their origin in the western region and shared status as foreign deities in the eyes of Mesopotamian theologians. He also points out that there is no indication that they were closely connected outside of Babylonia, especially in parts of Syria where they were most commonly worshiped. He additionally remarks that Lambert mistakenly assumed Ishara is one and the same as Haburitum, goddess of the river Habur, who also appears in Mesopotamian texts in association with Dagan. Both Feliu and Alfonso Archi point out that Haburitum and Ishara could appear side by side in the same documents, and therefore cannot be two names of the same deity. Archi considers it more likely that Haburitum was analogous to Belet Nagar. Like Feliu, he considers it implausible that Dagan was ever regarded as Ishara&#x27;s husband. He points out that the latter&#x27;s character was similar to Ishtar&#x27;s.

=== Dagan, Enlil and Kumarbi ===
In Mesopotamia, Dagan was equated with Enlil due to their shared role as &quot;fathers of gods.&quot; This equation was eventually codified by the god list &quot;An = Anum&quot;, which additionally equated their spouses with each other. However, which of the two parts of this equation was viewed as the primary god varied. In Mari, it was Dagan who received Enlil&#x27;s epithets, and in Emar the logographic writing dKUR, a shortened version of Enlil&#x27;s epithet dKur-gal (Great Mountain), stood for Dagan&#x27;s name in the late Bronze Age. It is unclear if this equation was responsible for the logographic writing of the name of Emar&#x27;s city god as dNIN.URTA, as the god of Emar is unlikely to be Dagan&#x27;s primary son Hadad (whose name was written logographically as dIŠKUR), and in Hurrian sources from Syria dNIN.URTA is the war god Aštabi rather than a weather god.

In Hurrian tradition, Dagan was equated with Kumarbi, though only because of shared senior position in the respective pantheons. Kumarbi was nonetheless called &quot;the Dagan of the Hurrians,&quot; and Shalash was viewed as his spouse due to this syncretic process. However, she is absent from Hurrian myths about Kumarbi.

=== Dagan and weather gods ===
Due to the similarity between the names of Dagan&#x27;s wife Shalash and Shala, wife of Adad in Mesopotamia, some researches conclude that the two goddesses were the same and that Dagan was possibly a weather god himself. However, there is no clear proof that Dagan fulfilled such a function or that he was conflated with any weather gods.

=== Dagan and Nisaba ===
In some documents from Syrian cities, for example Halab and Ugarit, the logogram dNISABA designates Dagan. As noted by Alphonso Archi, in Western Semitic languages such as Ugaritic Dagan&#x27;s name was homophonous with the word for grain (&quot;dgn&quot; in alphabetic Ugaritic texts), and the logographic writing of his name as dNISABA was likely a form of wordplay popular among scribes, relying on the fact that the name of Nisaba, the Mesopotamian goddess of writing, could simply be understood as &quot;grain&quot; too.

== Character ==
Dagan&#x27;s character is difficult to study in comparison to that of gods who held a comparable position in Mesopotamia (such as Enlil or Marduk) due to the lack of mythical narratives or hymns about him and a comparatively small number of other document; nonetheless, researchers were able to determine some of his functions.

Sources from Emar, Aleppo and Mari attest that Dagan was an archetypal &quot;father of gods&quot; and a creator figure. This aspect of his character was likely exemplified by the epithet &quot;lord of the offspring&quot; connected to the &quot;zukru&quot; festival from Emar. His connection to funerary offerings was most likely an extension of his role as a divine ancestor, and modern theories regarding him as an underworld god are most likely erroneous.

One of Dagan&#x27;s best documented functions was guaranteeing abundant harvests of grain. However, he was not an agricultural god but rather the source of prosperity in general.

In the 3rd millennium BCE, Tuttul Dagan was the god believed to bestow kingship upon rulers. He had a similar role in Mari. There is also some evidence that he could be invoked as a divine witness of oaths.

According to texts from Ebla, Dagan&#x27;s attributes were a chariot and a mace.

== Worship ==
Dagan&#x27;s primary cult centers were Tuttul, where his clergy was likely involved in the traditional form of governance, and Terqa (near Mari), where his temple &quot;E-kisiga&quot; (&quot;the house, the silent place&quot;) was located. The worship of Dagan evidently spread over a large area from these cities, even though its principal centers were not a major political power in their own right, a situation which according to Alfonso Archi can be compared to that of Hadabal (a 3rd millennium BCE god of the upper Orontes valley) and Hadad of Halab. In addition to Tuttul and Terqa, settlements in which Dagan possessed a temple or shrine include Mari, Subatūm (located in the proximity of the aforementioned city), Urah (on the left bank of the Euphrates), Hakkulân, Šaggarātum, Zarri-amnān, Dašrah, Ida-Maras (in the Habur triangle), Admatum (a village in the kingdom of Ašlakkā), as well as Emar and various difficult to locate villages in its proximity.

In Ebla, Dagan was usually referred to with titles such as &quot;lord of Tuttul&quot; (dBAD Du-du-luki) or &quot;lord of the country&quot; (dBAD KALAMTIM), but a phonetic spelling can be found in personal names. References to him as Bel Terqa – &quot;Lord of Terqa&quot; – are known from Eblaite sources too. Shalash was already regarded as his wife in this period. Representatives of the city of Nagar swore allegiance to the king of Ebla in the temple of Dagan in Tuttul, which was viewed as a neutral third party. While certain other gods known from the Eblaite texts, such as Hadabal and Kura, disappear from records after the fall of the city, Dagan&#x27;s cult continued and retained its prestige.

In Mari, Dagan and Addu (Hadad) were protectors of the king and played a role in enthronement ceremony. Multiple kings of Mari regarded Dagan as the source of their authority. During the reign of Zimri-Lim, Dagan was one of the gods who received the most offerings during festivals, with other deities comparably celebrated in official offering lists including the local dynasty&#x27;s tutelary deity Itūr-Mēr, Annunitum, Nergal, Shamash, Ea, Ninhursag, Addu (Hadad) and Belet Ekalli (Ninegal). In a letter Zimri-Lim&#x27;s wife Šibtu enumerated Dagan, Shamash, Itūr-Mēr, Belet Ekalli and Addu as &quot;the allies for me&quot; and the deities who &quot;go by my lord&#x27;s side.&quot; The Terqa temple was closely associated with Zimri-Lim. A source from the period of his reign attests that to celebrate his coronation, a weapon was sent from Hadad&#x27;s temple in Aleppo to Dagan&#x27;s in Terqa, likely to legitimize his rule. It is possible that this ritual object represented the mace wielded by the weather god in his battle with the sea (analogous to the battle between Baal and Yam in the Ugaritic Baal cycle). Despite the close connection between the clergy of Dagan from Terqa and Zimri-Lim, he was viewed unfavorably by the population of Tuttul and the presence of his officials was in at least one case regarded as a disturbance of Dagan&#x27;s rites.

In Emar, Dagan was the most senior god in offering lists, preceding the weather god (Baal/Hadad) and the city god, whose name was written logographically as NIN.URTA. An important celebration dedicated to him in this location was so-called &quot;erēb Dagan&quot;, &quot;entry of Dagan.&quot; It took the form of a cultic journey of a statue, similar to celebrations of deities such as Lagamal or Belet Nagar attested in the same region. He was also celebrated during the &quot;zukru&quot; festival. Another festival dedicated to him known from documents from Emar was &quot;kissu&quot;, which most likely took place in Šatappi, a city possibly located further south. The precise meaning of the term &quot;kissu&quot; remains uncertain, making the nature of these celebrations, and roles of specific deities in them, difficult to ascertain. It has been proposed that the presence of underworld deities – Shuwala and Ugur – indicates that it represented the periodic death and return to life of a deity, possibly Dagan&#x27;s spouse, but this remains speculative.

Ḫammu-rāpi, who, around 1400 BCE, ruled the area comprising the former independent Kingdom of Khana, used the title &quot;governor of Ilaba and Dagan.&quot;

Due to the scarcity of sources, the later history of Dagan&#x27;s cult remains unclear; however, it is evident that he was no longer the head god of the upper Euphrates area in later times. The head of the Aramean pantheon known from sources from the first millennium BCE was Hadad.

=== Mesopotamian reception ===
Mesopotamian rulers saw Dagan as the lord of the western lands (e.g., ancient Syria) and thanked him for enabling their conquests in that area. Inscriptions credit Dagan with granting Sargon of Akkad rule over the &quot;Upper Land&quot; and the cities of Ebla, Mari and Yarmuti in particular, as well as over areas as distant as the &quot;cedar forest and silver mountains.&quot; To gain Dagan&#x27;s favor, Sargon prayed to him in Tuttul. An inscription from the reign of Naram-Sin describes inhabitants of the western frontier of his empire &quot;as far as (the city of) Ulišum&quot; as &quot;people whom the god Dagan had given to him.&quot;

In Mesopotamian sources, Dagan is sometimes regarded as equal in rank to the great city gods of Sumer and Akkad. One text uses the formula &quot;Ishtar in Eanna, Enlil in Nippur, Dagan in Tuttul, Ninhursag in Kesh, Ea in Eridu.&quot;

In the Ur III period, marriages between rulers of Syrian and Mesopotamian politites likely contributed to the spread of the worship of Dagan, as well other western deities like Ishara and Haburitum, in the south of Mesopotamia. In Nippur, Dagan shared a temple with Ishara, first attested during the reign of Amar-Suen. Both deities were likely introduced from Mari and were linked only by their northwestern origin. Ishbi-Erra of Isin, assumed to be of Amorite origin and described by Ibbi-Sin of Ur as &quot;man of Mari&quot; and &quot;traveling rubbish salesman of non-Sumerian origin&quot; frequently mentioned Dagan in documents. Several of Ishbi-Erra&#x27;s successors on the throne had theophoric names invoking Dagan, among them Iddin-Dagan and Ishme-Dagan. They were also involved in restoring his temples in Isin and in Ur. Some aspects of the syncretism between Dagan and Enlil seemingly can be attributed to this dynasty.

A few of the early Amorite kings of Assyria mention Dagan in their inscriptions, for example Shamshi-Adad I called himself &quot;worshipper of Dagan&quot; in a document describing the expansion of the god&#x27;s temple in Terqa. Elsewhere he referred to himself as &quot;beloved of Dagan.&quot; An inscription of his son Yasmah-Adad, however, refers to &quot;Mullil [Enlil] (...) who dwells in Tuttul.&quot;

A &quot;šubtu&quot; (a type of shrine) of Dagan was located near Ka-ude-babbar, one of the gates of the Esagil temple complex in Babylon.

Itti-Marduk-balatu, a king from the Second Dynasty of Isin (middle Babylonian period), called himself Dagan&#x27;s regent.

The stele of the 9th century BC Assyrian emperor Ashurnasirpal II refers to Ashurnasirpal as the favorite of Anu and of Dagan. This phrase might, however, be simply a literary relic.

==== Mythology ====
In the Mesopotamian god list, &quot;An = Anum&quot;, Dagan was placed in the circle of Enlil; this is similar to another western deity, Ishara. The same document equates him with Enlil and his wife Shalash with Ninlil.

There is some evidence that in Mesopotamia Dagan was connected with the poorly known tradition about conflict between the gods and Enmesharra, for example a passage stating that &quot;with Dagan&#x27;s authority [gods] have been guarding Enmešarra from time immemorial&quot; is known; Dagan might however be a synonym of Enlil rather than a distinct deity in this context according to Wilfred G. Lambert.

The fragmentary myth &quot;Uraš and Marduk&quot; (here the male god from Dilbat, not the earth goddess) mentions Dagan, similarly most likely fully equated in this context with Enlil.

A legendary king of Purushanda who serves as an opponent of Sargon of Akkad in the epic King of Battle bears the name Nūr-Dagan.

=== Ugarit ===
Evidence from the coastal city of Ugarit is inconclusive. Whether a temple initially often identified as Dagan&#x27;s was dedicated to him rather than El is a matter of scholarly debate.

In lists of gods and offerings from Ugarit, Dagan sometimes follows El but precedes Baal. Two such examples are known, but in six Dagan follows El and Baal. An incantation against snakebite mentions Dagan alongside Baal, while El is paired with Horon.

Dagan appears in six theophoric names known from Ugarit, and possibly in a seventh under the logographic spelling dKUR; for comparison Baal appears in 201, with further 36 using the form Haddu. For comparison, in known documents from Mari Hadad appears in 159 names, while Dagan in 138. However, only 17% of known names from Ugarit are theophoric, which makes it difficult to tell how representative are they when it comes to estimating the popularity of some deities. Additionally, many gods prominent in texts from Ugarit, including Anat, are uncommon in personal names, while the Mesopotamian god Ea (under a phonetic spelling of the name, which makes it impossible he was a logographic stand-in for local god Kothar-wa-Khasis) appeared frequently in them.

==== Dagan, El, and Baal&#x27;s parentage ====
Dagan plays no active role in Ugaritic myths (such as the Baal cycle), though Baal is frequently referred to as his &quot;son&quot; or &quot;lineage.&quot; In the poem &quot;Marriage of Nikkal and Yarikh&quot; he is referred to as &quot;Dagan of Tuttul,&quot; possibly indicating that he was viewed as a foreign god by Ugaritic scribes.

It has been argued by Joseph Fontenrose in an article from 1957 that, whatever their deep origins, at Ugarit, Dagan was sometimes identified with El, explaining why Dagan, who possibly had an important temple at Ugarit is so neglected in the Ras Shamra mythological texts, where he is merely the father of Baal, but Anat, El&#x27;s daughter, is Baal&#x27;s sister, and why no temple of El has appeared at Ugarit. More recent research shows that evidence for identification of Dagan with El is at best indirect. In god lists El was equated with Hurrian Kumarbi and Mesopotamian Enlil rather than directly with Dagan. Alfonso Archi notes in some texts both appear separately, but also that Dagan was extraneous to the theology of Ugarit.

Other recent studies provide various other approaches to the problem of Baal&#x27;s parentage in mythical texts. Daniel Schwemer proposes that the epithet &quot;Son of Dagan&quot; applied to Baal in Ugaritic texts was influenced by Syrian and Hurrian tradition. Noga Ayali-Darshan states that the portrayal of the relationship between El and Baal in the Baal cycle is similar to that between Kumarbi and Teshub in the Kumarbi cycle, and that in the Hellenized Phoenician tradition recorded by Philo of Byblos Demarous (Baal) has both a biological father (&quot;Ouranos&quot;) and a step-father (Dagon) - both of them distinct from Elos (El; in this Phoenician myth a brother of Dagon). She also notes that due to the circumstances of his birth, Teshub had two fathers: one opposing him and one who supported his rise to power. She suggests that therefore it is not necessarily contradictory that two separate gods were regarded as Baal&#x27;s fathers, though she assumes both in Ugarit and in Phoenician beliefs Dagan/Dagon was merely an element introduced from the culture of inland Syria and played no significant role himself. Aaron Tugendhaft considers Baal an outsider who is not a member of the family of El and Athirat in the beginning of the narrative and thus not their son by birth, but merely a brother of their children in the sense known from Bronze Age diplomatic texts. He argues that much as allied kings referred to each other as &quot;brothers&quot;, so did the gods in Ugaritic myths.

=== Iron Age Phoenicia ===
The Phoenician inscription on the sarcophagus of King Eshmunʿazar of Sidon (5th century BC) relates: &quot;Furthermore, the Lord of Kings gave us Dor and Joppa, the mighty lands of Dagon, which are in the Plain of Sharon, in accordance with the important deeds which I did.&quot; However, said king built no temples dedicated to Dagon in his city, and this god appears only in an insignificant role in the treaty between Esarhaddon and king Baal I of Tyre. It is therefore doubtful if he was prominent in Phoenician religion.

== Later relevance ==
According to Philo of Byblos, Sanchuniathon reportedly made Dagon the brother of Cronus, both sons of the Sky (Uranus) and Earth (Gaia), but not Hadad&#x27;s biological father. Hadad (Demarus) was begotten by &quot;Sky&quot; on a concubine before Sky was castrated by his son Ēl, whereupon the pregnant concubine was given to Dagon. Accordingly, Dagon in this version is Hadad&#x27;s half-brother and stepfather. The Byzantine &quot;Etymologicon Magnum&quot; lists Dagon as the &quot;Phoenician Cronus.&quot;

The first-century Jewish historian Josephus mentions a place named Dagon above Jericho. It has however been argued that some of the locations possibly named after Dagon were in reality named after the Canaanite word for grain.

=== Jewish and Christian scriptures ===

In the Hebrew Bible, Dagon is referenced three times as the head god of the Philistines; however, there are no references to Dagon as a Canaanite god. According to the Bible, his temples were located at Beth-dagon in the territory of the tribe of Asher (Joshua 19.27), and in Gaza (see Judges 16.23, which tells soon after how the temple is destroyed by Samson as his last act). Another temple, located in Ashdod, was mentioned in 1 Samuel 5:2–7 and again as late as 1 Maccabees 10.83 and 11.4. King Saul&#x27;s head was displayed in a temple of Dagon after his death (). There was also a second place known as Beth-Dagon in Judah (Joshua 15.41).

The account in 1 Samuel 5.2–7 relates how the Ark of the Covenant was captured by the Philistines and taken to Dagon&#x27;s temple in Ashdod. The following morning the Ashdodites found the image of Dagon lying prostrate before the ark. They set the image upright, but again on the morning of the following day they found it prostrate before the ark, but this time with head and hands severed, lying on the &quot;miptān&quot; translated as &quot;threshold&quot; or &quot;podium&quot;. The account continues with the puzzling words &quot;raq dāgōn nišʾar ʿālāyw&quot;, which means literally &quot;only Dagon was left to him.&quot; (The Septuagint, Peshitta, and Targums render &quot;Dagon&quot; here as &quot;trunk of Dagon&quot; or &quot;body of Dagon&quot;, presumably referring to the lower part of his image.

Dagon is also mentioned in the First Book of Ethiopian Maccabees (12:12), which was composed sometime in the 4th century AD.

==== Fish-god interpretation ====

The &quot;fish&quot; etymology, while late and incorrect, was accepted in 19th and early 20th century scholarship. It led to an erroneous association between Dagan and Odakon, a half-fish being mentioned by Berossus, and with &quot;fishman&quot; motifs in Mesopotamian art, in reality depictions of Kulullû, an apotropaic creature associated with the god Ea.

The association with &quot;dāg&quot;/&quot;dâg&quot; &#x27;fish&#x27; was made by 11th-century Jewish Bible commentator Rashi. In the 13th century, David Kimhi interpreted the odd sentence in 1 Samuel 5.2–7 that &quot;only Dagon was left to him&quot; to mean &quot;only the form of a fish was left&quot;, adding: &quot;It is said that Dagon, from his navel down, had the form of a fish (whence his name, Dagon), and from his navel up, the form of a man, as it is said, his two hands were cut off.&quot; The Septuagint text of 1 Samuel 5.2–7 says that both the hands &quot;and the head&quot; of the image of Dagon were broken off.

The first to cast doubt on the &quot;fish&quot; etymology was in his 1928 study of Dagan, though he initially nonetheless suggested that while Dagon was not in origin a &quot;fish god&quot;, the association with &quot;dâg&quot; &quot;fish&quot; among the maritime Canaanites (Phoenicians) would have affected the god&#x27;s iconography. However, later he correctly identified it as a medieval invention. Modern researchers not only do not accept it, but even question if Dagan/Dagon was worshiped in coastal areas in any significant capacity at all.

=== Dagon and Marnas ===

In the Classical period, the central temple of Gaza was dedicated to a god named Marnas (from Aramaic &quot;marnā,&quot; &quot;lord&quot;). Itamar Singer considered it a possibility that this name was a title of the hypothetical Philistine Dagon, though he notes he was equated not with a Levantine or Syrian deity but with Cretan Zeus, &quot;Zeus Krētagenēs&quot;. However, Gerard Mussies considers Marnas and Dagan to be two separate deities. According to Taco Terpstra, Marnas&#x27; origins are &quot;nebulous,&quot; and while his name can be plausibly assumed to be Aramaic, his iconography follows Hellenistic conventions. At times he is shown naked, similar to a naked and bearded Zeus, either seated on a throne or standing while holding a lightning bolt. Other images show him in a form similar to Apollo, holding a bow and standing on a pedestal in front of a female deity. Regardless of the variety of depictions, the abundance of them on coins indicates that the inhabitants of Gaza held him in high esteem and associated this god with their city. Textual sources portray him as a &quot;sky god who also performed oracles.&quot; An indirect reference to Marnas occurs in an inscription from Roman Portus from the reign of Gordian III (238-244 CE), which relays that the city of Gaza honored this ruler &quot;at the prompting of its ancestral god.&quot;

Marnas is mentioned in the works of the fourth century scholar and theologian Jerome, in several stories from his &quot;Life of St. Hilarion&quot;, written around 390 CE, in which he condemns his adherents as idolatrous and as &quot;enemies of God.&quot; Violent sentiments against the cult of Marnas and the destruction of his temple in Gaza, the Marneion, are described by Mark the Deacon in his account of the life of the early fifth-century saint Porphyry of Gaza (&quot;Vita Porphyri&quot;). After the destruction of Marnas&#x27;s temple, Mark petitioned the emperor Arcadius through his wife Eudoxia to grant a request to have all pagan temples in Gaza destroyed. Terpstra notes there is no direct evidence for the historicity of this account, as Porphyry is not mentioned by other contemporary authors and is entirely absent from inscriptions. However, it does indeed appear that, in the early fifth century, the temple of Marnas was replaced by a Christian church. However, the majority of Gazans were not Christians in the fifth century CE, and likely continued to worship their city&#x27;s tutelary deity.

==In popular culture==
Dagon has appeared in many works of popular culture. However, most depend on the biblical account and associated fish god speculation rather than on primary sources and modern research.

Notable examples include John Milton&#x27;s epic poems &quot;Samson Agonistes&quot; and &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, &quot;Dagon&quot; and &quot;The Shadow Over Innsmouth&quot; by H. P. Lovecraft, &quot;Dagon&quot; by Fred Chappell, &quot;Middlemarch&quot; by George Eliot, and &quot;King of Kings&quot; by Malachi Martin.

Also, the extinct prehistoric beaked whale species, &quot;Dagonodum mojnum&quot;, is named after Dagon.

<doc id="106341" wikidata="Q4166523" url="?curid=106341" title="Direct sum of groups">
<text>In mathematics, a group &quot;G&quot; is called the direct sum of two normal subgroups with trivial intersection if it is generated by the subgroups. In abstract algebra, this method of construction of groups can be generalized to direct sums of vector spaces, modules, and other structures; see the article direct sum of modules for more information. A group which can be expressed as a direct sum of non-trivial subgroups is called &quot;decomposable&quot;, and if a group cannot be expressed as such a direct sum then it is called &quot;indecomposable&quot;.

== Definition ==
A group &quot;G&quot; is called the direct sum of two subgroups &quot;H&quot;1 and &quot;H&quot;2 if
* each &quot;H&quot;1 and &quot;H&quot;2 are normal subgroups of &quot;G&quot;,
* the subgroups &quot;H&quot;1 and &quot;H&quot;2 have trivial intersection (i.e., having only the identity element formula_1 of &quot;G&quot; in common),
* &quot;G&quot; = ⟨&quot;H&quot;1, &quot;H&quot;2⟩; in other words, &quot;G&quot; is generated by the subgroups &quot;H&quot;1 and &quot;H&quot;2.

More generally, &quot;G&quot; is called the direct sum of a finite set of subgroups {&quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;} if
* each &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot; is a normal subgroup of &quot;G&quot;,
* each &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot; has trivial intersection with the subgroup ,
* &quot;G&quot; = ⟨{&quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;}⟩; in other words, &quot;G&quot; is generated by the subgroups {&quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;}.

If &quot;G&quot; is the direct sum of subgroups &quot;H&quot; and &quot;K&quot; then we write , and if &quot;G&quot; is the direct sum of a set of subgroups {&quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;} then we often write &quot;G&quot; = Σ&quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;. Loosely speaking, a direct sum is isomorphic to a weak direct product of subgroups.

== Properties ==
If , then it can be proven that:

* for all &quot;h&quot; in &quot;H&quot;, &quot;k&quot; in &quot;K&quot;, we have that 
* for all &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, there exists unique &quot;h&quot; in &quot;H&quot;, &quot;k&quot; in &quot;K&quot; such that 
* There is a cancellation of the sum in a quotient; so that is isomorphic to &quot;H&quot;

The above assertions can be generalized to the case of , where {&quot;H&quot;i} is a finite set of subgroups:

* if , then for all &quot;h&quot;&quot;i&quot; in &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;h&quot;&quot;j&quot; in &quot;H&quot;&quot;j&quot;, we have that 
* for each &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, there exists a unique set of elements &quot;h&quot;&quot;i&quot; in &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot; such that
:&quot;g&quot; = &quot;h&quot;1 ∗ &quot;h&quot;2 ∗ ... ∗ &quot;h&quot;&quot;i&quot; ∗ ... ∗ &quot;h&quot;&quot;n&quot;
* There is a cancellation of the sum in a quotient; so that is isomorphic to Σ&quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;.

Note the similarity with the direct product, where each &quot;g&quot; can be expressed uniquely as
:&quot;g&quot; = (&quot;h&quot;1,&quot;h&quot;2, ..., &quot;h&quot;&quot;i&quot;, ..., &quot;h&quot;&quot;n&quot;).

Since for all , it follows that multiplication of elements in a direct sum is isomorphic to multiplication of the corresponding elements in the direct product; thus for finite sets of subgroups, Σ&quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot; is isomorphic to the direct product ×{&quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;}.

==Direct summand==
Given a group formula_2, we say that a subgroup formula_3 is a direct summand of formula_2 if there exists another subgroup formula_5 of formula_2 such that formula_7.

In abelian groups, if formula_3 is a divisible subgroup of formula_2, then formula_3 is a direct summand of formula_2.

==Examples==

* If we take formula_12 it is clear that formula_13 is the direct product of the subgroups formula_14.

* If formula_3 is a divisible subgroup of an abelian group formula_2 then there exists another subgroup formula_5 of formula_2 such that formula_19.
* If formula_2 also has a vector space structure then formula_2 can be written as a direct sum of formula_22 and another subspace formula_5 that will be isomorphic to the quotient formula_24.

==Equivalence of decompositions into direct sums==

In the decomposition of a finite group into a direct sum of indecomposable subgroups the embedding of the subgroups is not unique. For example, in the Klein group formula_25 we have that
: formula_26 and
: formula_27

However, the Remak-Krull-Schmidt theorem states that given a &quot;finite&quot; group &quot;G&quot; = Σ&quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot; = Σ&quot;B&quot;&quot;j&quot;, where each &quot;A&quot;&quot;i&quot; and each &quot;B&quot;&quot;j&quot; is non-trivial and indecomposable, the two sums have equal terms up to reordering and isomorphism.

The Remak-Krull-Schmidt theorem fails for infinite groups; so in the case of infinite &quot;G&quot; = &quot;H&quot; + &quot;K&quot; = &quot;L&quot; + &quot;M&quot;, even when all subgroups are non-trivial and indecomposable, we cannot conclude that &quot;H&quot; is isomorphic to either &quot;L&quot; or &quot;M&quot;.

==Generalization to sums over infinite sets==

To describe the above properties in the case where &quot;G&quot; is the direct sum of an infinite (perhaps uncountable) set of subgroups, more care is needed.

If &quot;g&quot; is an element of the cartesian product Π{&quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;} of a set of groups, let &quot;g&quot;&quot;i&quot; be the &quot;i&quot;th element of &quot;g&quot; in the product. The external direct sum of a set of groups {&quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;} (written as ΣE{&quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;}) is the subset of Π{&quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;}, where, for each element &quot;g&quot; of ΣE{&quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;}, &quot;g&quot;&quot;i&quot; is the identity formula_28 for all but a finite number of &quot;g&quot;&quot;i&quot; (equivalently, only a finite number of &quot;g&quot;&quot;i&quot; are not the identity). The group operation in the external direct sum is pointwise multiplication, as in the usual direct product.

This subset does indeed form a group, and for a finite set of groups {&quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;} the external direct sum is equal to the direct product.

If &quot;G&quot; = Σ&quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;, then &quot;G&quot; is isomorphic to ΣE{&quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot;}. Thus, in a sense, the direct sum is an &quot;internal&quot; external direct sum. For each element &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, there is a unique finite set &quot;S&quot; and a unique set {&quot;h&quot;&quot;i&quot; ∈ &quot;H&quot;&quot;i&quot; : &quot;i&quot; ∈ &quot;S&quot;} such that &quot;g&quot; = Π {&quot;h&quot;&quot;i&quot; : &quot;i&quot; in &quot;S&quot;}.

<text>Childeric II ( 653 – 675) was King of the Franks in the 7th century. He ruled Austrasia from 662 and Neustria and Burgundy from 673 until his death, making him sole king for the final two years of his life.

Childeric was the second eldest son of King Clovis II and grandson of King Dagobert I and Queen Nanthild. His mother was Saint Balthild and his elder brother was Chlothar III, who was briefly sole king from 661 but gave Austrasia to Childeric the next year. Childeric was still a mere child when he was raised on the shields of his warriors and proclaimed king in Austrasia.

Childeric married his cousin Bilichild, who gave birth to two sons: Dagobert and the future king Chilperic II.

After the death of Chlothar in 673, Theuderic III, his youngest brother, inherited his kingdoms, but a faction of prominent Burgundian nobles led by Saint Leodegar and Adalrich rebelled against Theuderic and Ebroin, Mayor of the Palace, inviting Childeric to become king in Neustria and Burgundy. He soon invaded his brother&#x27;s kingdom and displaced him, becoming sole king. He made his Austrasian Mayor of the Palace, Wulfoald, mayor in Neustria and Burgundy as well, upsetting his supporters in Burgundy who did not wish to see functionaries active in a kingdom other than their native one. In March 675, Childeric granted &quot;honores&quot; in Alsace to Adalrich with the title of &quot;dux&quot;. This grant was most probably the result of Adalrich&#x27;s continued support for Childeric in Burgundy, which had often disputed possession of Alsace with Austrasia.

The final straw for the magnates of Neustria was Childeric&#x27;s illegal corporal punishment of a nobleman named Bodilo. In 675, Bodilo and his friends Amalbert and Ingobert conspired to assassinate the king, who was killed, along with his wife Bilichild and his five-year-old son Dagobert, while hunting in the forest of Livry (present-day Lognes). Childeric&#x27;s younger son, Chilperic, was absent and thus survived. He grew up in a monastery.

Childeric, his wife, and their son Dagobert were buried in Saint-Germain-des-Prés, near Paris, where their tombs were discovered in 1645 and the contents pilfered.

<text>Gustav Walter Heinemann (; 23 July 1899 – 7 July 1976) was a German politician who was President of West Germany from 1969 to 1974. He served as mayor of Essen from 1946 to 1949, West German Minister of the Interior from 1949 to 1950, and Minister of Justice from 1966 to 1969.

==Early years and professional career==
Heinemann was named after his mother&#x27;s father, a master roof tiler in Barmen, with radical-democratic, left-liberal, and patriotic views. His maternal grandfather, Heinemann&#x27;s great-grandfather, had taken part in the Revolution of 1848. His father, Otto Heinemann, a manager at the Krupp steelworks in Essen, shared his father-in-law&#x27;s views. In his youth, Gustav already felt called upon to preserve and promote the liberal and democratic traditions of 1848. Throughout his life, he fought against all kinds of subservience. This attitude helped him to maintain his intellectual independence even in the face of majorities in political parties and in the Church.

Having finished his elite secondary education in 1917, Heinemann briefly became a soldier in the First World War, but his severe illness stopped him from being sent to the front.

From 1918, Heinemann studied law, economics, and history at the universities of Münster, Marburg, Munich, Göttingen, and Berlin, graduating in 1922 and passing the bar in 1926. He received a Ph.D in 1922 and a doctorate of law in 1929.

The friendships that Heinemann formed during his student years often lasted for a lifetime. Among his friends were such different people as Wilhelm Röpke, who was to become one of the leading figures of economic liberalism, Ernst Lemmer, later a trade unionist and also a Christian Democrat, and Viktor Agartz, a Marxist.

At the beginning of his career, Heinemann joined a renowned firm of solicitors in Essen. In 1929, he published a book about legal questions in the medical profession. From 1929 to 1949, he worked as a legal adviser to the Rheinische Stahlwerke in Essen, and from 1936 to 1949, he was also one of its directors. 

The steelworks were considered to be essential for the war so Heinemann was not drafted into the army. He was a lecturer at the law school of the University of Cologne between 1933 and 1939. It was probably his refusal to become a member of the Nazi Party that ended his academic career.

Heinemann was invited to join the board of directors of the Rheinisch-Westfälische Kohlensyndikat (Rhenish-Westphalian Coal Syndicate) in 1936, but the invitation was withdrawn due to Heinemann&#x27;s refusal to end his work for the anti-Nazi Confessing Church.

==Family and religion==
In 1926, Heinemann married Hilda Ordemann (1896–1979), who had been a student of Rudolf Bultmann, the famous Protestant theologian. His wife and the minister of his wife&#x27;s parish, Wilhelm Graeber, led Heinemann back to Christianity from which he had become estranged. Through his sister-in-law, he became acquainted with Swiss theologian Karl Barth, who strongly influenced him such as in his condemnation of nationalism and antisemitism.

Gustav and Hilda Heinemann had three daughters, Uta (later Uta Ranke-Heinemann), Christa (mother of Christina Rau, former federal president Johannes Rau&#x27;s wife) and Barbara; they also had a son, Peter.

Heinemann was an elder (&quot;Presbyter&quot;) in Wilhelm Graeber&#x27;s parish in Essen, when Graeber was sacked in 1933 by the new church authorities who co-operated with the Nazis. Opposition against those German Christians came from the Confessing Church, and Heinemann became a member of its synod and its legal adviser. As he disagreed with some of the developments within the Confessing Church, he withdrew from the church leadership in 1939, but he continued as an elder in his parish, in whose capacity he gave legal advice to persecuted fellow Christians and helped Jews who had gone into hiding by providing them with food.

Information sheets of the Confessing Church were printed in the cellar of Heinemann&#x27;s house at Schinkelstrasse 34 in Essen, Moltkeviertel, and distributed all over Germany.

From 1936 to 1950, Heinemann was head of the YMCA in Essen.

In August 1945, he was elected as a member of the Council of the Protestant Church in Germany. The Council issued the Stuttgart Declaration of Guilt in October 1945 in which it confessed guilt for the failure of the Protestant church to oppose the Nazis and the Third Reich. Heinemann regarded the declaration as a &quot;linchpin&quot; in his work for the church.

From 1949 to 1955, Heinemann was president of the all-German Synod of the Protestant Churches of Germany. He was among the founders of the German Protestant Church Congress (&quot;Deutscher Evangelischer Kirchentag&quot;), a congress of the Protestant laity. In 1949, he was also one of the founding editors of &quot;Die Stimme der Gemeinde&quot; (&quot;The Voice of the Congregation&quot;), a magazine which was published by the &quot;Bruderrat&quot; (Brethren&#x27;s Council) of the Confessing Church. In the World Council of Churches he belonged to its &quot;Commission for International Affairs&quot;.

==Early political career==
As a student, Heinemann, like his friends Lemmer and Roepke, belonged to the &quot;Reichsbund deutscher demokratischer Studenten&quot;, the student organization of the liberal German Democratic Party, which strongly supported the democracy of the Weimar Republic.

Heinemann heard Hitler speak in Munich in 1920 and had to leave the room after interrupting Hitler&#x27;s diatribe against the Jews.

In 1930, Heinemann joined the &quot;Christlich-Sozialer Volksdienst&quot; (&quot;Christian Social People&#x27;s Service&quot;), but he voted for the Social Democratic Party in 1933 to try to prevent a victory of the NSDAP.

==Postwar==
After the Second World War, the British authorities appointed Heinemann mayor of Essen, and in 1946, he was elected to that office, which he kept until 1949. He was one of the founders of the Christian Democratic Union in North Rhine-Westphalia, in which he saw an interdenominational and democratic association of people opposed to Nazism. He was a member of the North Rhine-Westphalian parliament (&quot;Landtag&quot;, 1947–1950), and from 1947 to 1948, he was Minister of Justice in the North Rhine-Westphalian government of CDU Prime Minister Karl Arnold.

When Konrad Adenauer became the first Chancellor of the newly founded Federal Republic of Germany in 1949, he wanted a representative of the Protestants in the CDU in his government. Heinemann, the president of the Synod of Protestant Churches, reluctantly agreed to become the Minister of the Interior although he had planned to resume his career in industry.

A year later, when it became known that Adenauer had secretly offered German participation in a Western European army, Heinemann resigned from the government. He was convinced that any form of armament in West Germany would diminish the chances of German reunification and increase the risk of war.

Heinemann left the CDU, and in 1952 he founded his own political party, the All-German People&#x27;s Party (&quot;Gesamtdeutsche Volkspartei&quot;). Among its members were such politicians as future Federal President Johannes Rau and also Erhard Eppler. They advocated negotiations with the Soviet Union with the aim of a reunited, neutral Germany between the blocs, but the GVP failed to attract many voters. Heinemann dissolved his party in 1957 and joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), whose aims were relatively close to his own. There, he soon became a member of the party&#x27;s National Executive. He helped the SPD to change into a &quot;Volkspartei&quot; (party of the people) by opening it up for socially-minded Protestants and middle-class people especially in the industrial districts of Germany.

In October 1950 Heinemann had started practising as a lawyer again. In court, he predominantly represented political and religious minorities. He also worked for the release of prisoners in East Germany. Later, he defended conscientious objectors to compulsory military service and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses in court. The latter refused to do even community work instead of military service because of their absolute conscientious objection.

As an MP in the Bundestag, the parliament of West Germany, Heinemann passionately fought against Adenauer&#x27;s plans of acquiring atomic weapons for the West German army (&quot;Bundeswehr&quot;).

In the &quot;Grand Coalition&quot; government of Chancellor Kurt Georg Kiesinger (CDU) and Foreign Minister Willy Brandt (SPD) Heinemann was Minister of Justice (1966–1969). He initiated a number of liberal reforms, especially in the field of criminal law.

==President of West Germany==
In March 1969 Gustav Heinemann was elected President of West Germany. As he was elected with the help of most delegates of the Free Democratic Party (FDP/Liberals) his election was generally understood as a sign of the re-orientation of the FDP with regard to a future coalition with the SPD (Social-liberal coalition, October 1969 – October 1982).

In an interview Heinemann once said that he wanted to be &quot;the citizens&#x27; president&quot; rather than &quot;the president of the state&quot;. He established the tradition of inviting ordinary citizens to the president&#x27;s New Year&#x27;s receptions, and in his speeches, he encouraged West Germans to overcome the tradition of submissiveness to the authorities, to make full use of their democratic rights and to defend the rule of law and social justice. This attitude and his open-mindedness towards the student protests of 1968 made him popular among the younger generation as well. When asked whether he loved the West German state, he answered that he loved not the state but his wife.

Heinemann mainly visited countries that had been occupied by German troops in World War II. He supported the social-liberal government&#x27;s policy of reconciliation with the Eastern European states. He promoted research into the nature of conflicts and of peace, as well as into environmental problems.

It was Heinemann&#x27;s idea to found a museum for the commemoration of German liberation movements, and he was able to open such a place officially in Rastatt in 1974. His interest in that subject was partly from the involvement of his own ancestors in the revolution of 1848.

On account of his age and fragile health, Heinemann did not stand for a possible second term as President in 1974. He died in 1976.

A short time before his death, Heinemann published an essay in which he criticized the &quot;Radikalenerlass&quot; (&quot;Radicals Decree&quot;) of 1972, a rule that subjected all candidates for the civil service (including prospective teachers, railway engine drivers, and postmen) to special scrutiny to exclude political radicals. He thought it was not compatible with the spirit of the constitution that a large group of people were generally treated as suspects.

The &quot;Gustav-Heinemann-Friedenspreis&quot; (Gustav Heinemann Peace Prize) is an annual prize for children&#x27;s and young people&#x27;s books that are deemed to have best promoted the cause of world peace.

<doc id="106344" wikidata="Q272860" url="?curid=106344" title="The Elephant Man (film)">
<text>The Elephant Man is a 1980 biographical drama film loosely based on the life of Joseph Merrick (referred to as &quot;John&quot; in the film), a severely deformed man who lived in London in the late 19th century. The film was directed by David Lynch, produced by Jonathan Sanger, and executive produced by Mel Brooks (who was uncredited, to avoid audiences anticipating the film being in the vein of his comedic works, although his company Brooksfilms is in the opening credits). It stars John Hurt, Anthony Hopkins, Anne Bancroft, John Gielgud, Wendy Hiller, Michael Elphick, Hannah Gordon, and Freddie Jones.

The screenplay was adapted by Lynch, Christopher De Vore, and Eric Bergren from Frederick Treves&#x27; &quot;The Elephant Man and Other Reminiscences&quot; (1923) and Ashley Montagu&#x27;s &quot;The Elephant Man: A Study in Human Dignity&quot; (1971). It was shot in black-and-white by Freddie Francis and featured make-up work by Christopher Tucker.

&quot;The Elephant Man&quot; was a critical and commercial success with eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Actor. After receiving widespread criticism for failing to honour the make-up effects, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences was prompted to create the Academy Award for Best Makeup the following year. The film also won the BAFTA Awards for Best Film, Best Actor, and Best Production Design and was nominated for Golden Globe awards. It also won a French César Award for Best Foreign Film. Since its release, &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; has been regarded as among the greatest biopics ever and one of the best films of the 1980s.

==Plot==

Frederick Treves, a surgeon at the London Hospital, finds John Merrick in a Victorian freak show in London&#x27;s East End, where he is kept by Mr. Bytes, the brutish ringmaster. His head is kept hooded while in public, and his &quot;owner&quot;, who views him as intellectually disabled due to his muteness, is paid by Treves to have him brought to the hospital for examination.

Treves presents Merrick to his colleagues and highlights his physical abnormalities; his deformed skull forces him to sleep with his head on his knees, since if he were to lie down, he would asphyxiate. On Merrick&#x27;s return, he is beaten so badly by Bytes that his errand boy has to call Treves for medical help. Treves brings Merrick back to the hospital, where he is tended to by hospital matron Mrs. Mothershead, as the other nurses are too frightened of him. Mr. Carr Gomm, the hospital&#x27;s Governor, is against housing Merrick, as the hospital does not accept &quot;incurables&quot;. Treves encourages Merrick to speak, finding him to be intellectually competent.

To prove that Merrick can make progress, Treves trains him to say a few conversational sentences and part of the 23rd Psalm. Carr Gomm sees through this ruse but, as he is leaving, Merrick begins to recite the whole of the Psalm. Merrick tells the doctors that he knows how to read and has memorized the 23rd Psalm because it is his favourite. Carr Gomm permits him to stay, and Merrick spends his time building a model of a cathedral he can partially see from his window.

At tea with Treves and his wife, Ann, Merrick views photos of their family and in return shows them his mother&#x27;s picture. He believes he must have been a &quot;disappointment&quot; to her but hopes she would be proud to see him with his &quot;lovely friends&quot;. Merrick begins to take guests in his room, including the actress Madge Kendal, who gives him a copy of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;; they play some lines from it and Kendal kisses Merrick.

Merrick quickly becomes an object of curiosity to high society, and Mrs. Mothershead expresses concerns that he is still being put on display as a freak for this audience. Treves begins to question the morality of his own actions. Meanwhile, a night porter named Jim starts selling tickets to locals who come at night to gawk at the &quot;Elephant Man&quot;.

The issue of Merrick&#x27;s residence is challenged at a hospital council meeting, but he is guaranteed permanent residence by command of the hospital&#x27;s royal patron, Queen Victoria, who sends word with her daughter-in-law Alexandra. However, during one of Jim&#x27;s raucous late-night showings, Merrick is kidnapped by Bytes. Another night porter reports this to Treves, who confronts Jim about what he has done; Jim is then fired by Mothershead.

Bytes takes Merrick on the road as a circus attraction once again. During a &quot;show&quot; in Belgium, Merrick, who is weak and dying, collapses, causing a drunken Bytes to lock him in a cage at night and leave him to die. Merrick is released by his fellow freakshow attractions who are escaping Bytes. Upon returning to London, he is harassed through Liverpool Street station by several young boys and accidentally knocks down a young girl. Merrick is chased, unmasked, and cornered by an angry mob. Before collapsing, he cries &quot;I am not an elephant! I am not an animal! I am a human being! I am a man!&quot;

Policemen return Merrick to the hospital and Treves. He recovers some of his health but is dying of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Merrick thanks Treves for all he has done, saying his life is now fulfilled. Treves and Mothershead take Merrick, accompanying Princess Alexandra, to see a pantomime. Kendal comes on stage afterwards and dedicates the performance to him, and a proud Merrick receives a standing ovation from the audience.

Back at the hospital, Merrick bids Treves goodnight and completes his cathedral model. He lies down on his back in bed, imitating a sleeping child in a picture on his wall, and dies. He is consoled by a vision of his mother, who quotes Lord Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Nothing Will Die&quot;.

==Production==

===Development===
Producer Jonathan Sanger optioned the script from writers Christopher De Vore and Eric Bergren after receiving the script from his babysitter. Sanger had been working as Mel Brooks&#x27; assistant director on &quot;High Anxiety&quot;. Sanger showed Brooks the script, whereupon he decided to help finance via Brooksfilms, his new company. Brooks&#x27; personal assistant, Stuart Cornfeld, suggested David Lynch to Sanger.

Sanger met Lynch, and they shared scripts they were working on (&quot;The Elephant Man&quot; and Lynch&#x27;s unrealized &quot;Ronnie Rocket&quot;). Lynch told Sanger that he would love to direct the script after reading it, and Sanger endorsed him after hearing Lynch&#x27;s ideas. However, Brooks had not heard of Lynch at the time. Sanger and Cornfeld set up an &quot;Eraserhead&quot; viewing at a 20th Century Fox screening room; Brooks loved it and enthusiastically agreed for Lynch to direct. By his own request, Brooks was not credited as executive producer to ensure that audiences would not expect a comedy after seeing his name attached.

===Casting===
Dustin Hoffman wanted the role of John Merrick, but Sanger rejected the idea, saying &quot;We’re always going to be looking to see where the Elephant Man ends and Dustin Hoffman begins&quot;. Lynch considered his friend Jack Nance, who he worked with on &quot;Eraserhead&quot;, for the role, but he cast John Hurt in the role after seeing &quot;The Naked Civil Servant&quot;. At the time, Hurt was still making &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; which had fallen badly behind schedule due to director Michael Cimino&#x27;s perfectionism. Hurt spent so long waiting for something to do that he performed the role of Merrick in the interim before returning to &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; to complete shooting.

===Filming===
The budget was $5 million, $4 million of which was raised from Fred Silverman of NBC. The remainder came from EMI Films.

For his second feature and first studio film, albeit one independently financed, Lynch provided the musical direction and sound design. Lynch also tried to design the make-up himself, but the design didn&#x27;t work. The makeup, now supervised by Christopher Tucker, was based on direct casts of Merrick&#x27;s body, which had been kept in the Royal London Hospital&#x27;s private museum. The makeup took seven to eight hours to apply each day and two hours to delicately remove. John Hurt would arrive on set at 5 am and shoot his scenes from noon until 10 pm. After his first experience of the inconvenience of having to apply the makeup and perform with it, he called his girlfriend, saying, &quot;I think they have finally managed to make me hate acting.&quot; Because of the strain on the actor, he worked alternate days. 

The film is bookended with surrealist sequences centred around Merrick&#x27;s mother and her death. Lynch used Samuel Barber&#x27;s &quot;Adagio for Strings&quot; to underline the climax and Merrick&#x27;s own death. Composer John Morris argued against using the music, stating that &quot;this piece is going to be used over and over and over again in the future... And every time it&#x27;s used in a film it&#x27;s going to diminish the effect of the scene.&quot;

===Post-production===
Following their return from England with a print, Lynch and Sanger screened &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; for Brooks, who suggested some minor cuts but told them that the film would be released as they had made it.

==Lawsuit==
A West End play of the same name was enjoying a successful Broadway run at the time of the film&#x27;s production. The producers sued Brooksfilms over the use of the title.

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;The Elephant Man&quot; was a box office hit, grossing $26 million in the United States. In Japan, it was the second highest-grossing foreign film of the year with theatrical rentals of ¥2.45 billion, behind only &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, it has an approval rating of 92% based on 63 reviews, with an average score of 8.5/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;David Lynch&#x27;s relatively straight second feature finds an admirable synthesis of compassion and restraint in treating its subject, and features outstanding performances by John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100 based on 16 critic reviews, indicating &quot;generally favourable reviews&quot;.

Vincent Canby wrote: &quot;Mr. Hurt is truly remarkable. It can&#x27;t be easy to act under such a heavy mask ... the physical production is beautiful, especially Freddie Francis&#x27; black-and-white photography.&quot;

A small number of critics were less favourable. Roger Ebert gave it 2/4 stars, writing: &quot;I kept asking myself what the film was really trying to say about the human condition as reflected by John Merrick, and I kept drawing blanks.&quot; In the book &quot;The Spectacle of Deformity: Freak Shows and Modern British Culture&quot;, Nadja Durbach describes the work as &quot;much more mawkish and moralising than one would expect from the leading postmodern surrealist filmmaker&quot; and &quot;unashamedly sentimental&quot;. She blamed this mawkishness on the use of Treves&#x27; memoirs as source material.

&quot;The Elephant Man&quot; has since been ranked among the best films of the 1980s in &quot;Time Out&quot; (where it placed 19th), &quot;Paste&quot; (56th), and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; (38th), and among the greatest biopics of all time. The film also received five votes in the 2012 &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; polls.

===Accolades===

&quot;The Elephant Man&quot; was nominated for eight Academy Awards, tying &quot;Raging Bull&quot; at the 53rd Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Actor in a Leading Role (Hurt), Art Direction-Set Decoration (Stuart Craig, Robert Cartwright, Hugh Scaife), Best Costume Design, Best Director, Best Film Editing, Music: Original Score, and Writing: Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium. However, it did not win any.

Industry experts were appalled that the film was not going to be honoured for its make-up effects when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced its nominations at the time. A letter of protest was sent to the academy&#x27;s Board of Governors requesting to give the film an honorary award. The academy refused, but in response to the outcry, they decided to give the make-up artists their own category. A year later, the Academy Award for Best Makeup category was introduced with &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot; as its first recipient.

It won the BAFTA Award for Best Film, and other BAFTA Awards for Best Actor (Hurt) and Best Production Design, and was nominated for four others: Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography and Editing.

The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2005: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes:
** John Merrick: &quot;I am not an animal! I am a human being. I am a man.&quot; – Nominated

===Home media===
The film has been issued many times on VHS, Betamax, CED, LaserDisc and DVD. The first DVD was released on December 11, 2001, by Paramount Home Entertainment. The version released as part of the David Lynch &quot;Lime Green Box&quot; includes several interviews with Lynch and Hurt, and a Joseph Merrick documentary. This material is also available on the exclusive treatment on the European market as part of Optimum Releasing&#x27;s StudioCanal Collection. The film has been available on Blu-ray since 2009 throughout Europe and in Australia and Japan but not in the US (however the discs will play in both region A &amp; B players).
A 4K restoration (created from the original camera negative, supervised by Lynch) was carried out for the film&#x27;s 40th anniversary, and was released in a director-approved special edition in both Blu-ray and DVD formats from The Criterion Collection in the United States on September 29, 2020. The restoration was also released on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray (including a remastered Blu-ray) in the UK in April 2020.

A tie-in novelization by Christine Sparks was published by Ballantine Books in 1980.

==Soundtrack==
The musical score of &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; was composed and conducted by John Morris, and it was performed by the National Philharmonic Orchestra. In 1980, the company 20th Century Fox Records published this film&#x27;s original musical score as both an LP album and as a cassette in the United States. Its front cover artwork features a masked John Merrick against a backdrop of smoke, as seen on the advance theatrical poster for the film.

In 1994, the first compact disc (CD) issue of the film score was made by the company Milan, which specializes in film scores and soundtrack albums.

==In popular culture==
Michael Jackson used excerpts from the film in his song &quot;Morphine&quot; from the 1997 remix album &quot;Blood on the Dance Floor: HIStory in the Mix&quot;.

The Jam&#x27;s former bassist Bruce Foxton was inspired strongly by the film, and in response wrote the song &quot;Freak&quot; with the single&#x27;s cover making a reference to the film.

Actor Bradley Cooper credits watching the film with his father as a child as his inspiration to become an actor. Cooper played the character in a Broadway revival of &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; play in 2014.

In season 3, episode 21 of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Black Widower&quot;, Lisa daydreams of Aunt Selma&#x27;s new boyfriend as the Elephant Man.

In season 4, episode 13 of &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;The Pick&quot;, in defense of allegedly picking his nose, Jerry pleads to a surrounding crowd: &quot;Are we not human? If we pick, do we not bleed? I am not an animal!&quot;

The 1992 film &quot;Batman Returns&quot; parodies the iconic line &quot;I am not an animal. I am a man.&quot; In one scene, the Penguin, after being called Oswald, angrily yells &quot;I am not a human being! I am an animal!&quot;

British TV presenter Karl Pilkington often has cited it as his favourite film. Pilkington&#x27;s love for the film brought many new features to his various podcasts and radio shows.

Musician Michael Stipe loves the film and cites it as an inspiration for the R.E.M. song &quot;Carnival of Sorts (Boxcars)&quot;. Another R.E.M. song, &quot;New Test Leper&quot;, quotes the line &quot;I am not an animal.&quot;

Musician Nicole Dollanganger featured a sample of the film in her 2012 song &quot;Cries of the Elephant Man Bones&quot;.

Musician Mylène Farmer&#x27;s song &quot;Psychiatric&quot; from the 1991 album &quot;L&#x27;autre...&quot; is a tribute to the film and John Hurt&#x27;s voice is sampled throughout the song, repeating several times: &quot;I&#x27;m a human being, I&#x27;m not an animal&quot;.

<doc id="106345" wikidata="Q295157" url="?curid=106345" title="Childeric III">
<text>Childeric III ( 717 – 754) was King of the Franks from 743 until he was deposed in 751 by Pepin the Short. He was the last Frankish king from the Merovingian dynasty. Once Childeric was deposed, Pepin became king, initiating the Carolingian dynasty.

==Background==
Following the reign of Dagobert I (629–634), the power of the Merovingian kings gradually declined into a ceremonial role, while the real power in the Frankish kingdom was increasingly wielded by the mayors of the palace. In 718, Charles Martel combined the roles of mayor of the palace of Neustria and mayor of the palace of Austrasia, consolidating his position as the most powerful man in Francia. After the death of king Theuderic IV in 737, Charles Martel ruled without a king on the throne.

After Charles Martel&#x27;s death in 741, Carloman and Pepin the Short, his sons by his first wife Rotrude, became co-mayors of the palace. However, they soon faced revolts from their younger half-brother Grifo and their brother-in-law Odilo, Duke of Bavaria. These revolts may have played a part in their decision to fill the throne with a Merovingian king after a six-year vacancy to add legitimacy to their reigns.

==Life==

Childeric&#x27;s parentage and his relation to the Merovingian family are uncertain. He may have been either the son of Chilperic II or Theuderic IV.

According to Einhard, Charlemagne&#x27;s biographer, Childeric took little part in public business and would, once a year, be brought in an ox cart led by a peasant and preside at court on a throne, giving answers prepared by the mayors to visiting ambassadors. In this narrative, he had neither political nor economic power, depending on his own small estate and on mayoral support.

After Carloman retired to a monastery in 747, Pepin resolved to take the royal crown for himself. Pepin sent letters to Pope Zachary, asking whether the title of king belonged to the one who had exercised the power or the one with the royal lineage. The pope responded that the real power should have the royal title as well. In 751, Childeric was dethroned and tonsured. His long hair was the symbol of his dynasty, and thus of the royal powers he enjoyed; by cutting it, they divested him of all royal prerogatives. Once dethroned, he was confined to the Benedictine monastery of Saint-Bertin in Saint-Omer, while his son Theuderic was sent to the monastery of Saint-Wandrille.

There are conflicting accounts of exactly when Childeric died, with some sources claiming as early as 753, while others state that his death occurred as late as 758.

<doc id="106346" wikidata="Q52226" url="?curid=106346" title="Battle of Mogadishu (1993)">
<text>The Battle of Mogadishu (), also known as the Black Hawk Down Incident, was part of Operation Gothic Serpent. It was fought on 3–4 October 1993, in Mogadishu, Somalia, between forces of the United States—supported by UNOSOM II—against Somali National Alliance (SNA) fighters and other insurgents in south Mogadishu.

The battle took place during the UNOSOM II phase of the UN intervention in the Somali Civil War. The United Nations had initially dispatched forces to alleviate the 1992 famine, but then shifted to attempting to restore a central government and establishing a democracy. In June 1993, UNOSOM II forces suffered significant losses when the Pakistani troops were attacked while inspecting a SNA radio station and weapons-storage site. UNOSOM blamed SNA leader General Mohammed Farah Aidid and began military operations against him. In July 1993, U.S. forces in Mogadishu conducted the Bloody Monday raid, killing many elders and prominent members of Aidid&#x27;s clan, the Habr Gidr. The raid led many Somalis to either join or support the growing insurgency against UNOSOM forces, and US forces started being deliberately targeted for the first time. This, in turn, led American President Bill Clinton to initiate Operation Gothic Serpent in order to capture Aidid.

On 3 October 1993, U.S. forces planned to seize two of Aidid&#x27;s top lieutenants during a meeting deep in the city. The raid was only intended to last an hour but morphed into an overnight standoff and rescue operation extending into the daylight hours of the next day. While the goal of the operation was achieved, it was a pyrrhic victory and spiraled into the deadly Battle of Mogadishu. As the operation was ongoing, Somali insurgents shot down three American Black Hawk helicopters using RPG-7s, with two crashing deep in hostile territory, resulting in the capture of an American pilot. A desperate defense of the two downed helicopters began and fighting lasted through the night to defend the survivors of the crashes. Through the night and into the next morning, a large UNOSOMII armored convoy consisting of Pakistani, Malaysian and American troops pushed through the city to relieve the besieged troops and withdrew incurring further casualties but rescuing the survivors.&quot;&quot;

No battle since the Vietnam War had killed so many U.S. troops. Casualties included 18 dead American soldiers and 73 wounded, with Malaysian forces suffering one death and seven wounded, and Pakistani forces two injuries. Somali casualties, a mixture of insurgents and civilians, were far higher; most estimates are between 133 and 700 dead. 

After the battle, dead US troops were dragged through the streets by enraged Somalis, an act that was broadcast on American television to public outcry. The battle led to the end of Operation Gothic Serpent and UNOSOM II military operations, which Somali insurgents saw as victory. By early 1995, all UN forces withdrew from Somalia. Fear of a repeat drove American reluctance to increase direct involvement in Somalia and other parts of Africa. It has commonly been referred to as &quot;Somalia Syndrome&quot;.

==Background==
Throughout the 1980s the Somali Rebellion escalated, eventually culminating in the full outbreak of the Somali Civil War and the collapse of the regime of President Siad Barre at the start of 1991. Food shortages began in mid-1990, the final year of Siad Barre&#x27;s rule. By early 1991, the formal economy collapsed as rebel groups toppled the Somali Democratic Republic. A severe drought hit southern Somalia in 1991–1992, while the civil war disrupted traditional coping mechanisms as law enforcement disintegrated. This led to the emergence of the 1992 famine, the primary cause of which was the war&#x27;s devastation of infrastructure and farmland in the inter-riverine regions.

The main rebel faction that had toppled the regime was the United Somali Congress (USC), which divided into two armed factions: one led by Ali Mahdi Muhammad, who later became president; and the other by General Mohamed Farrah Aidid, which became known as the Somali National Alliance (SNA). After losing control of Mogadishu, remnants of former President Barres forces created the Somali National Front (SNF) and withdrew south into the nations breadbasket. Serious damage was inflicted in Somalia&#x27;s agricultural regions during fighting between the SNF and Aidid&#x27;s forces, before the latter drove the SNF far into the south of the country.

=== UNOSOM and UNITAF ===

In early 1992, as relief agencies initiated operations to respond to the humanitarian crisis, they encountered growing obstacles in delivering aid to the impacted affected inter-riverine region. The disintegration of Somali law enforcement paved the way for armed looters and criminals to steal food from storage sites and supply routes. Many thieves at Mogadishu&#x27;s sea and airport, the main supply hub, were linked to the rebel forces of Ali Mahdi and Mohamed Farah Aidid but were effectively demobilized following the rout of the SNF. With militia leaders lacking funds and Barre&#x27;s forces no longer presenting a unifying threat and, Aidid and Mahdi increasingly lost control over many young fighters, as did clan elders. As a result, many resorted to food theft for survival and income. In response to this deteriorating security situation, UNOSOM I was established in April 1992 under the leadership of Mohamed Sahnoun to help facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid. In May 1992 the first UN aid shipment arrived in Mogadishu.&quot;&quot;

During August 1992, U.S. President George H.W. Bush launched Operation Provide Relief, deploying U.S. military transport aircraft to support the UN relief effort in Somalia. That same month, UNOSOM I head Mohammed Sahnoun secured Somali National Alliance approval for 500 peacekeepers, with further deployments requiring the groups consent. However, UN Secretary-General Boutros Ghali unilaterally announced an expansion to 3,500 troops days later, undermining the local support Sahnoun had built. Overruled by UN headquarters, he failed to delay the deployment.&quot;&quot; The large-scale intervention in late 1992 fueled nationalist opposition, bolstering Aidid&#x27;s SNA, which denounced the UN&#x27;s perceived colonial approach. By November 1992, largely owing to the mediation efforts of Mohamed Sahnoun, aid was flowing through the Mogadishu port unimpeded, with theft and banditry on the routes to famine zones averaging around 20%. That same month, Sahnoun was replaced by Ismat T. Kittani, who took a confrontational approach, deploying UNOSOM troops into politically sensitive areas and triggering a security crisis with local factions. Kittani claimed 80% of aid shipments were looted, a figure later echoed by the UN Secretariat and the U.S. State Department to justify expanding intervention, though many top UN officials and aid workers disputed the figure. In the view of some top UNOSOM I commanders, the scope of the famine was being exaggerated in order to justify using Somalia as an experiment, as the UN Secretariat believed Somalia represented an ideal candidate for a test case of a UN operation of expanded size and mandate.

On 9 December 1992, American troops began landing on the Somali coastline at Mogadishu under UNITAF (Operation Restore Hope). A total 17,800 US Marines and 10,000 US Army infantry were deployed. The famine in Somalia was already concluding as the troops began landing. The United States had various motives for military involvement in Somalia. The US armed forces wanted to prove its capability to conduct major &#x27;Operations Other Than War&#x27;, while the US State Department wanted to set a precedent for humanitarian military intervention in the post-Cold War era. The United Nations&#x27; intervention, backed by U.S. Marines, has been credited with helping end the famine in Somalia, though the starvation had been improving in the worst-affected areas before troops arrived and had the effect of speeding the conclusion of the crisis by about a month. In 1994, the Washington-based Refugee Policy Group NGO estimated that of the approximately 100,000 lives that were saved as a result of international assistance, 10,000 had been after the deployment of US troops.

===Mission shift and increasing tensions===
On 3 March 1993, United Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali submitted to the U.N. Security Council his recommendations for shifting from UNITAF to UNOSOM II. He said that since Resolution 794&#x27;s adoption in December 1992, UNITAF had deployed 37,000 personnel over forty percent of southern and central Somalia. He said the force&#x27;s presence and operations had improved Somalia&#x27;s security situation and the delivery of humanitarian assistance. There was still no effective government, police, or national army, resulting in serious security threats to U.N. personnel. To that end, the Security Council authorized UNOSOM II to establish a secure environment throughout Somalia, to achieve national reconciliation so as to create a democratic state.

At the Conference on National Reconciliation in Somalia, held on 15 March 1993, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, all 15 Somali parties agreed to the terms set out to restore peace. Major disagreements between the UN and the Somali National Alliance began soon after the establishment of UNOSOM II, centering on the perceived true nature of the operations political mandate. In May 1993, relations between the SNA and UNOSOM rapidly deteriorated, resulting in the SNA engaging in &quot;anti-UNOSOM propaganda&quot; broadcasts from Radio Mogadishu.

=== UNOSOM offensive and Mogadishu insurgency ===

On 5 June 1993, SNA fighters and Somali citizens at Radio Mogadishu attacked the Pakistani force that was inspecting an arms cache located at the station, out of fear that the United Nations forces had been sent to shut down the SNA&#x27;s broadcast infrastructure. Radio was the most popular medium for news in Somalia, and consequently control of the airwaves was considered vital to both the SNA and UNOSOM. Radio Mogadishu was a highly popular station with the residents of Mogadishu, and rumors that the United Nations was planning to seize or destroy it had been abound for days before 5 June. On May 31, 1993, Aidid&#x27;s political rivals met with the top UNOSOM official and attempted to convince him to take over Radio Mogadishu, a meeting Aidid was made well aware of. According to the 1994 United Nations Inquiry in the events leading up to the Battle of Mogadishu:&quot;Opinions differ, even among UNOSOM officials, on whether the weapons inspections of 5 June 1993 was genuine or was merely a cover-up for reconnaissance and subsequent seizure of Radio Mogadishu.&quot; The attack marked a seminal moment in the UNOSOM II operation. The Pakistani forces suffered 24 dead and 57 wounded, as well as one wounded Italian and three wounded U.S. soldiers. On 6 June 1993, the Security Council passed Resolution 837, a call for the arrest and prosecution of the persons responsible. Though Resolution 837 did not name Aidid, it held the Somali National Alliance responsible. The hunt for Aidid became a major focus of the U.N. intervention through the Battle of Mogadishu. Admiral Jonathan Howe issued a $25,000 warrant for information leading to Aidid&#x27;s arrest, while UNOSOM forces began attacking targets all over Mogadishu in hopes of finding him. Professor Ioan M. Lewis asserts that the UN made an unwise choice to resort to military force, which led to substantial Somali casualties, rather than attempting to politically isolate Aidid and launch an independent legal inquiry.

In mid-June 1993, American AC-130 gunships began striking SNA targets across the capital and an insurgency began growing against UNOSOM forces. When Somali insurgents and UNOSOM forces skirmished, it proved to be costly to each—especially for the Somali, who were usually outgunned by heavy weaponry. Through the rest of June the insurgency escalated, resulting in growing losses on both sides, in one instance a crowd of protestors were machine gunned by UNOSOM troops resulting in the death of at least 20 civilians. A week after the start of the offensive, U.S. intelligence claimed Aidid&#x27;s command was badly weakened, SNA morale had collapsed, and most of its arsenal was destroyed. Officials estimated only 300 fighter&#x27;s loyal to Aidid opposed UNOSOM, driven by cash or the drug khat. Instead each major armed confrontation with UN forces was noted to have the effect of inadvertently increasing Aidid&#x27;s stature with the Somali public. The UNOSOM offensive backfired politically, alienating many Somalis, boosting support for Aidid, and drawing international criticism. In response, many UNOSOM II contingents pushed for diplomacy with the SNA, while relief agencies began distancing themselves from the UN. Former Under-Secretary-General of the UN, Ramesh Thakur, observed that, &quot;The scale, intensity, and frequency of the use of force by UNOSOM after June 1993 bore little resemblance to the rhetoric and expectations of when it was established, nor any recognizable relationship by then to a peacekeeping operation as defined in the UN lexicon.&quot;

===Bloody Monday raid===
On 12 July 1993, a house where a meeting of clan elders was taking place was attacked by US AH-1 Cobra helicopters in what became known to the Somalis as Bloody Monday. UNOSOM claimed that they had launched a successful raid on a Somali National Alliance command and control center where hardliners had been gathered, an account that is widely disputed by Somalis, foreign journalists and human rights organizations. UNOSOM II head Johnathan Howe alleged that evidence to back UN claims could not be provided because the cameras recording the raid had jammed. The footage recorded of the incident by a Somali cameraman was considered so disturbing that CNN deemed it too graphic to show on air to the American public.Human Rights Watch observed that UNOSOM had produced no evidence to substantiate its claims about the raid. According to Dr. Sebastian Kaempf, the Abdi House raid represented the single most important event during UNOSOM II, as the consequences of the attack proved disastrous for UNOSOM interests in Somalia. Notable groups and organizations such as the Vatican, the Organisation of African Unity, World Vision, Doctors Without Borders, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International called for UNOSOM to review it policies and course.According to the Red Cross, there were 215 Somalis casualties, although in the aftermath of the attack they were able to survey the dead and injured at only two of the hospitals in Mogadishu. Human Rights Watch declared that the attack &quot;looked like mass murder&quot; and an American reporter who was present on the scene said that the raid was far deadlier than U.S. and U.N. officials acknowledged. An SNA official reported 73 were killed including many prominent clan elders, a charge UNOSOM denied. Bowden noted that every eyewitness he interviewed placed the number of dead at 70 or more and that former ambassador and U.S. special envoy to Somalia Robert B. Oakley accepted this figure. He further noted that many of those interviewed, including non-Somali aid workers, would say that many of those killed in the attack had been well-respected moderates opposed to Aidid. Regardless of the meeting&#x27;s true intent, the attack is generally considered as the most significant of the many incidents that occurred in 1993 that caused many Somalis to turn against UNOSOM II, especially the U.S. contingent.

The raid exposed deep rifts and created dissension amongst the UNOSOM II coalition, which consequently began fraying the cohesion and unity of the operation. The head of the UNOSOM II Justice Division would criticize the raid in a memo to head of UNOSOM. Further criticism of the raid came from numerous contributing states, most notably the Italian contingent, who threatened to pull out of the whole operation citing concerns that the escalation was indicative that relief role of UNOSOM II had been overtaken by an American-led war. Italy, which had ruled Somalia as a colonial territory for half a century, believed that the unprecedented attack threatened to widen the civil war and turn the Somalis against UNOSOM. Intense diplomatic efforts were made in order to avert a major split in UNOSOM II. Several UNOSOM contingents, ceased their participation in operations against Aidid upon receiving orders from their governments, weakening the already fragile command authority. Additionally, many humanitarian efforts came to a halt, and numerous NGOs expressed their disapproval of UNOSOM. The strike caused an outcry among UN civilian staffers and disenchantment over the direction of UNOSOM II for employees of the humanitarian section. Several UN officials resigned in protest, including the top UNOSOM II Justice Division official, Ann Wright. Many of those who stayed would comment to reporters that the UN had relinquished its moral authority in its war against Aidid. The dissension in the U.N. ranks with the Italians and others over what had occurred on July 12, 1993, led to a significant lull in UNOSOM operations in Mogadishu until the August 8, 1993 killings of American soldiers.

A significant increase in attacks on UNOSOM II troops followed 12 July 1993, and American forces in Mogadishu began deliberately targeted by Somali factions for the first times. Night patrols were halted entirely due to Mogadishu becoming to dangerous for foreign troops. In the view of Robert B. Oakley, &quot;Before July 12th, the U.S. would have been attacked only because of association with the UN, but the U.S. was never singled out until after July 12th&quot;. In the view of &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; author Mark Bowden argued that the raid marked a serious escalation of the conflict in Somalia and was &quot;a monumental misjudgment&quot; and &quot;tragic mistake&quot;. The events of Bloody Monday led Aidid to make the decision to specifically target American soldiers for the first time and resulted in the 8 August killings of U.S. troops that pushed President Clinton to send in extra troops to capture him.

===The August killings and the deployment of Task Force Ranger===

In the three weeks following the events of Bloody Monday there was a large lull in UNOSOM operations in Mogadishu, as the city had become incredibly hostile to foreign troops. Then on 8 August, in an area of the city that had been considered &quot;relatively safe to travel in&quot;, the SNA detonated a bomb against a U.S. military Humvee, killing four soldiers. A total of only three American soldiers had died in the intervention, marking the 8 August incident as the largest single killing of U.S. troops in Somalia so far.Two weeks later another bomb injured seven more. In response, U.S. President Bill Clinton approved the proposal to deploy a task force composed of elite special forces units, including 400 U.S. Army Rangers and Delta Force operators.

On 22 August 1993, the unit deployed to Somalia under the command of Major General William F. Garrison, commander of the special multi-disciplinary Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) at the time.

The force consisted of:
* B Company, 3rd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment under the command of Captain Michael D. Steele;
* C Squadron, 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta (1st SFOD-D) under the command of Lt Col Gary L. Harrell;
* A deployment package of 16 helicopters and personnel from the 1st Battalion, 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment (160th SOAR), which included MH-60 Black Hawks and AH/MH-6 Little Birds;
* Navy SEALs from the Naval Special Warfare Development Group (DEVGRU);
* Air Force Pararescuemen and Combat Controllers from the 24th Special Tactics Squadron.

===Escalation of insurgency and September Black Hawk shootdown===
As American casualties started to mount in Somalia, domestic backlash in the United States grew. Bipartisan support from the US senate began to build for a withdrawal. By August 1993, it was evident to the Clinton administration that a strategy shift was necessary to retain domestic support for US involvement in Somalia. This shift was signaled by Defense Secretary Les Aspin in his 27 August speech, advocating for a decreased military focus in UNOSOM II and urging the UN and the OAU to resume negotiations with all parties. Both the US Secretary of State and the National Security Advisor pushed for a shift towards diplomacy. Certain US officials advocated for a more aggressive response, among them was Ambassador Robert R. Gosende from the State Department. Gosende had written a cable recommending the deployment of thousands of additional troops and urged the abandonment of all diplomatic engagements with the SNA. Contrarily, General Joseph P. Hoar, who was at the helm of CENTCOM, expressed sharp disagreement with Gosende&#x27;s approach. In a confidential memo, General Hoar articulated his belief that if more American troops were needed, then control of Mogadishu was already lost.

During September, tensions escalated after incidents where UNOSOM troops fired on civilian demonstrators. That month, Somali insurgent used RPGs to attack U.S. Army Black Hawk helicopters, damaging at least one that managed to return to base. Then, at 2 a.m. on 25 September—a week before the Battle of Mogadishu—the SNA used an RPG to shoot down a Black Hawk (callsign Courage 53) while it was on patrol. The pilots were able to fly their burning aircraft away from Aideed&#x27;s turf to the more UNOSOM-friendly port of Mogadishu and make a crash landing. The pilot and co-pilot survived, but three crew members were killed. A shootout ensued as peacekeepers fought to the helicopter. The event was a propaganda victory for the SNA. The chief UNOSOM II spokesman in Mogadishu, U.S. Army Maj. David Stockwell, referred to the downing as &quot;a very lucky shot.&quot;

===Somali National Alliance and Irregular forces===
The Somali National Alliance (SNA) was formed in June 1992, following a successful defense by many factions against an offensive by Somali president Siad Barre, in his attempt to retake Mogadishu. During the UNOSOM hunt for Aidid, the SNA was composed of multiple political organizations, such as Col. Omar Gess&#x27; Somali Patriotic Movement, the Somali Democratic Movement, the combined Digil and Mirifle clans, the Habr Gedir of the United Somali Congress headed by Aidid, and the newly established Southern Somali National Movement. 

The size and structure of the SNA forces involved in the battle are not known in detail. Estimates of combatants widely vary, with figures often set to over a thousand possible fighters engaging at different points over the 17 hour battle. Estimates of SNA fighters during the battle are complicated by the many volunteers who impromptu joined skirmishes with foreign troops and the organizations use of &#x27;for hire&#x27; gunmen. Most of the fighters who participated belonged to the Somali National Alliance, drawing largely from Aidids Habar Gidir sub-clan of the Hawiye. According to Stephen Biddle, there were presumably 1,500 SNA fighters present in the entirety of Mogadishu. US intelligence had claimed prior to the battle Aidid had only 300 fighters loyal to him at most.
Colonel Sharif Hassan Giumale, Deputy Commander of the SNA High Commission on Defense, was the tactical commander who directly commanded Somali National Alliance fighters on the ground during the Battle of Mogadishu. Giumale, a 45-year-old former Somali army officer and brigade commander, had attended a Soviet military academy in Odessa and had later gone to Italy for further study. He had gathered combat experience in the Somali National Army during the Ogaden War with Ethiopia in the late 1970s and following the outbreak of the civil war in 1991. Many of the tactics Aidid, Giumale and other subordinate SNA commanders drew on were inspired by Chinese and Vietnamese books on guerrilla warfare and on advice from Somali mujahedeen veterans, who had just returned from the Soviet–Afghan War.Despite the substantial array of heavier weaponry in SNA stockpiles, none were used during the October 3–4 battle. SNA forces were primarily equipped with light infantry weaponry, like the AK-47 assault rifle. Experienced fighters supplemented the main forces with RPG-7, grenade launchers, sniper rifles, mortars, mines, and machine guns.

==== Irregular Somali forces/Volunteers ====
During the October 3–4 battle, SNA fighters fought alongside volunteer insurgents who were largely untrained civilians-turned-combatants, some of whom were women and children with grievances against UNOSOM troops. Large numbers of Somalis not affiliated with the SNA spontaneously joined the battle as it was ongoing, as small arms were widely distributed and available among the civilian population of Mogadishu. Many volunteers did not actually take part in combat, but instead operated as reconnaissance or runners for insurgents. Human rights abuses and killings by peacekeepers, U.S. military airstrikes in heavily populated neighborhoods resulting in civilian casualties, forced evictions for UN compound expansions and the difficulty of receiving legal recourse for wrongs committed by United Nations forces all inflamed the growing animosity of the civilian population of Mogadishu. American journalist Scott Peterson reported that in the days preceding the battle, Somali anger against UNOSOM troops was stoked when American mortar crews had fired shells into the dense neighborhoods surrounding their base, killing a family of eight and injuring 34. This enraged many citizens of South Mogadishu.

The irregulars often complicated the situation on the ground for SNA commanders, as they were not controllable and often got in the way by demanding ammunition and burdening the militia&#x27;s medical evacuation system. Some volunteers consisted of elderly people, women and children who utilized small arms. Many of the volunteers during the Battle of Mogadishu came from rival clans. Members of the Abgal and Habar Gidr clans, respectively loyal to Ali Mahdi and his prime rival Aidid, fought side by side against UNOSOM forces. Somali fighters from Al-Itihaad al-Islamiya also joined the battle.

== Planning ==

On the morning of 3 October 1993, a locally recruited intelligence asset reported to the CIA that two of Aidid&#x27;s principal advisors in the SNA, Omar Salad Elmi and Abdi Hassan Awale, would be meeting near the Olympic Hotel (). The asset said that Aidid and other high-ranking figures would possibly be present. The Olympic Hotel and the surrounding Bakara market was considered Habr Gidr territory and very hostile, as the clan made up a significant composition of the SNA militia. UNOSOM forces had refused to enter the area during previous engagements with the SNA.

The plan to capture the targets was relatively straightforward. First, the Somali CIA asset would drive to the site of the meeting and open the hood of his vehicle to mark the building for surveillance aircraft overhead. Delta operators would then assault and secure the building using MH-6 Little Bird helicopters. Four Ranger chalks under Captain Michael D. Steele would fast-rope from hovering MH-60L Black Hawks. The Rangers would then create a four-corner defensive perimeter around the target building to ensure that no enemy could get in or out. Fast-roping was deemed necessary for the raid as the Black Hawks had no suitable landing zone to deploy troops.

Special operations forces consisting of Bravo Company 3rd Battalion, the 75th Ranger Regiment; the 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta; and the 160th Aviation Battalion, would capture Omar Salad Elmi and Mohamed Hassan Awale. A column of 12 vehicles (nine Humvees and three M939 trucks) under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Danny McKnight would arrive at the building to take the assault team and their prisoners back to base. The entire operation was projected to take no longer than 30 minutes.

=== SNA defense strategy ===
The Somali National Alliance had divided South Mogadishu into 18 military sectors, each with its own field officer on alert at all times and a radio network linking them together. The SNA had an excellent grasp of the area around the Olympic Hotel, as it was their home turf, and had created an effective mobilization system that allowed commanders to quickly mass troops within 30 minutes into any area of South Mogadishu.

Col. Sharif Hassan Giumale had carefully analyzed Task Force Ranger&#x27;s previous six operations in Mogadishu and attempted to apply lessons from the civil war and from his extensive reading on guerrilla insurgencies, particularly the FLMN in El Salvador, who had developed anti-aircraft tactics with infantry weapons. After close observation, he had hypothesized the American raids stressed speed, so the SNA had to react more quickly. It was clear that the Americans greatest technological advantage in Mogadishu—and its Achilles&#x27; heel, the helicopter, had to be neutralized during one of the ranger raids. This would completely negate the American element of speed and surprise, which would consequently draw them into a protracted fight with his troops. An attacking force of militia would then surround the target and offset the superior American firepower with sheer numbers. Ambushes and barricades would be utilized in order to impede UNOSOM reinforcements.

Knowing U.S. special forces considered themselves elite, Giumale believed that they were hubristically underrating the tactical capacity of SNA fighters, who had months of urban fighting experience in the streets of Mogadishu. According to &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporter Rick Atkinson, most U.S. commanders in Mogadishu had underestimated the number of rocket-propelled grenades available to the SNA, and misjudged the threat they posed to helicopters.

== Raid ==

At 13:50, Task Force Ranger analysts received intelligence of Omar Salad&#x27;s location and the command was given to begin the operation. The code word &quot;Irene&quot; was called across radio channels, signaling the soldiers, vehicle convoys, and helicopters staged at Mogadishu International Airport to move out. Led by the MH-6 Little Birds fully loaded with rockets, sixteen helicopters took off from the airport to make the approximately four-minute flight to the target site. In an attempt to deceive Somali forces, the formation flew past the target before turning around en masse. American aircrew noticed soon after takeoff that Somalis had started to light burning tires around the city, a tactic the SNA had previously used to signal incursions and launch counterattacks.

At 15:42, the Little Birds carrying the Delta operators reached the target. Dust surrounding the area was so bad that one helicopter was forced to land out of position. Almost immediately after the first landing, a pilot began noticing small-arms fire. Then two Black Hawks carrying the second Delta assault team led by Delta Captain Austin S. Miller came into position and dropped their teams as the four Ranger chalks prepared to rope onto the four corners surrounding the target building. Chalk Four, carried by Black Hawk &quot;Super 67&quot;, piloted by CW3 Jeff Niklaus and CW2 Sam Shamp, was accidentally put a block north of their intended point (). Chalk Four declined the pilot&#x27;s offer to move them back down, saying it would take too long and leave the helicopter too exposed. Once on the ground, Chalk Four intended to move down to the planned position, but intense ground fire prevented them from doing so.

According to high ranking Somali National Alliance officials, 10 minutes of general confusion followed the arrival of the Black Hawks, but after getting a basic understanding of the situation, SNA Col. Sharif Hassan Giumale gave out the order over radio to officers across Mogadishu to start converging on the site of the battle and to begin organizing ambushes along likely reinforcement routes from the UNOSOM bases. Ten minutes later, the roads surrounding the Olympic Hotel were covered with militia and nearly sealed. SNA platoons arriving from other parts of South Mogadishu splintered into a half-dozen squads of about six or seven men. After the initial call to arms, the SNA commanders ceased radio transmissions, knowing that the Americans could jam and intercept their communications, opting to instead rely on hand-written dispatches and couriers.The ground-extraction convoy was supposed to reach the captive targets a few minutes after the operation&#x27;s beginning, but it was impeded by Somali citizens and local militia who formed barricades along Mogadishu&#x27;s streets with rocks, wreckage, rubbish and burning tires. Some 10 minutes later, it arrived near the Olympic Hotel (), down the street from the target building, where it waited for Delta and Rangers to complete their mission.

During the operation&#x27;s first moments, Private First Class Todd Blackburn lost his grip while fast-roping from &quot;Super 67&quot; as it hovered, and fell onto the street. Blackburn received severe injuries and required evacuation by a column of three Humvees. While taking Blackburn back to base, Sergeant Dominick Pilla, assigned to one of the Humvees being pelted with heavy fire from the surrounding buildings, was killed instantly when a bullet struck his head, becoming the first American killed in the battle.

The Humvee column arrived back at base, riddled with bullet holes and emitting smoke.

=== First Black Hawk down ===
About 40 minutes after the assault began, one of the Black Hawks, &quot;Super 61&quot;, piloted by CW3 Cliff &quot;Elvis&quot; Wolcott, was struck by an RPG-7 that sent the helicopter into an uncontrollable spin. The helicopter crashed in a residential area, coming to rest against a building wall in an alleyway about 300 yards east of the target building (). Both pilots were killed in the resulting crash and two of the crew (Staff Sgt. Ray Dowdy and Staff Sgt. Charlie Warren) were severely wounded. Two snipers, Staff Sergeant Daniel Busch and Sergeant Jim Smith, survived the crash and began defending the crash site.
SNA militiamen in the area began calling out local residents, shouting on megaphones, &quot;Come out and defend your homes!&quot; The militia fighters, in organized squads, quickly began to fan in and out of nearby buildings, alleys and trees to avoid the Little Bird helicopters converging to cover the wreck of &quot;Super 61.&quot; A nearby MH-6 Little Bird, &quot;Star 41&quot;, quickly flew down to the Black Hawk crash site. The pilot steadied the controls in his left hand and fired a machine gun with his right, while the copilot dashed into the alley and helped the two Delta snipers, one of them mortally wounded, into the back of their helicopter. AH-6 Little Birds repeatedly flew back to the airport to reload rockets and bullets. A request was made to the operation center for more ammunition to support carrying out further strafing runs, which was dispatched.

A combat search and rescue (CSAR) team was dispatched in Black Hawk &quot;Super 68.&quot; Led by Delta Captain Bill J. Coultrup, the 15-man CSAR team fast roped down to the &quot;Super 61&quot; crash site. While the last two men were rappelling, an SNA RPG hit the Black Hawk, nearly severing the main rotor blades, though &quot;Super 68&quot; managed to limp back to base. The CSAR team found both the pilots dead and two wounded inside the crashed helicopter. Under intense fire, the team moved the wounded men to a nearby collection point, where they built a makeshift shelter using kevlar armor plates salvaged from &quot;Super 61&quot;″s wreckage. 

Communications were confused between the ground convoy and the assault team. The assault team and the ground convoy waited for 20 minutes to receive their orders to move out. Both units were under the mistaken impression that they were to be first contacted by the other.

=== Second Black Hawk down ===
About 16:40, a Black Hawk with the callsign &quot;Super 64&quot; and piloted by Michael Durant was orbiting almost directly over the wreckage of Super 61. It was spotted by Yusuf Dahir Mo&#x27;alim, commander of a seven-man SNA RPG team that was slowly moving up towards the first crash site. One of the men in Mo&#x27;alim&#x27;s squad knelt down on the road, aimed at Super 64&#x27;s tail rotor and fired. The RPG hit the tail rotor, but the helicopter initially seemed to be fine. A few moments later, the rotor assembly disintegrated and the helicopter began to lurch forward and spin violently. It quickly dropped 100 feet, narrowly avoiding the large buildings in the area but slamming into a group of tin shacks in an upright position (). The downing of the helicopter produced a cheer from Somalis gathered in the area. It crashed into homes, killing several residents. Locals who had seen the crash amassed in a crowd and pushed towards &quot;Super 64&quot;.In the half-hour after the loss of &quot;Super 64&quot;, desperate U.S. commanders unsuccessfully attempted to relieve the besieged troops. A small Ranger relief column was dispatched from the airfield, only to lose two Humvees and three soldiers within one kilometer of the base. SNA commanders had anticipated the American response and had set up numerous coordinated ambushes. A few minutes later, Charlie Company of 10th Mountain Division&#x27;s Quick Reaction Force also tried to leave but was ambushed on Via Lenin road by SNA militia. In the break-out attempt, about 100 U.S. soldiers fired nearly 60,000 rounds of ammunition and used hundreds of grenades in 30 minutes before being forced to withdraw to the airfield. Due to constant ambushes and incessant Somali resistance, it would take nine more hours for the QRF ground forces to reach the besieged troops.

At the second crash site, two Delta snipers, Master Sergeant Gary Gordon and Sergeant First Class Randy Shughart, were inserted by Black Hawk &quot;Super 62&quot;. Their first two requests to be inserted were denied, but a third request was approved after the QRF troops were ambushed. After 10 minutes of &quot;Super 62&quot; giving fire support to the Delta snipers, an RPG slammed into the cockpit, ripping straight through the engine and knocking the copilot unconscious. Despite the damage, &quot;Super 62&quot;, piloted by CWO Mike Goffena and Captain James Yacone, was able to vacate the area and make a crash landing a safe distance away from the battle.

Lacking fire support, the snipers were overrun, and Gordon was fatally wounded. Shughart picked up Gordon&#x27;s CAR-15 and gave it to Durant. Shughart went back around the helicopter&#x27;s nose and held off the crowd for about 10 more minutes before he was killed. The crash site was then overrun and all the crew members were killed except Durant. He had nearly been beaten to death, then captured by Yusuf Dahir Mo&#x27;alim.

For their actions, Gordon and Shughart would be awarded the Medal of Honor, the first awarded since the Vietnam War.

=== Defense of crash sites ===
Back at the first crash site, about 90 Rangers and Delta Force soldiers found themselves under heavy Somali fire. Despite air support, they were effectively trapped for the night. The Rangers and Delta had spread over a two-block area and were fighting against enemies who were sometimes only a door away. Seeking shelter and a place to safeguard their wounded, the Americans had occupied four houses on Freedom Road, detaining about 20 Somalis who lived there. Several children were locked alone in the bathroom until soldiers let them rejoin their mothers, who would later allege that they had been handcuffed by the Americans.

At 6:40 p.m., Col. Sharif Hassan Giumale, in charge of managing the majority of the Somali forces on the ground, received written instruction from Aidid to repel any reinforcements and take all measures necessary to prevent the Americans from escaping. About 360 militiamen had encircled the first helicopter, along with hundreds of other armed Somalis volunteers and irregulars not associated with the SNA.

Knowing the Americans were well entrenched in defensive positions they had taken on the four houses on Freedom Road, Col. Giumale ordered six 60 mm mortars emplaced between 21 October Road and Armed Forces Street to obliterate the buildings. Before the assault was carried out an SNA officer came to Col. Giumale with the relatives of the Somalis detained in the homes and warned that there were women and children present in the building. Following the news of the civilian presence, Giumale sent a dispatch to another SNA commander, Col. Hashi Ali, that the mortars were to be held in abeyance except to harass UNOSOM reinforcements. Aidid would later send a dispatch agreeing with Giumales decision to halt the mortars, as he did not want the local civilian population to turn against the SNA. American officers who were later made privy Giumale&#x27;s decision conceded that the presence of the civilians prevented an attack, but disputed the notion that the mortars were powerful enough to wipe out Task Force Ranger. They contended that anti-mortar radar and Little Bird helicopters would have likely destroyed any mortar position after only firing one or two rounds. The SNA alleged that the Americans had used Somali civilians as human shields to protect themselves, a charge which American officials vehemently denied and countered that the civilians were not hostages.

While the U.S. forces waiting for relief held their position in the homes, AH-6 Little Birds, working in pairs and flying all night long, constantly strafed and pushed back the creeping forces of militia and have consequently been credited with keeping besieged Americans alive until dawn. As night came many of the volunteers and irregulars departed from the battle, leaving the experienced SNA fighters behind. U.S. soldiers would notice that the shooting became less frequent but far more accurate. A U.S. participant in the firefight would later remark, &quot;They used concealment very well. Usually all you saw of a shooter was the barrel of his weapon and his head.&quot;

=== Relief convoy ===
Several more rescue attempts were launched from Mogadishu airport to relieve the troops in the city. A rescue convoy led by US Lt. Colonel Lawrence Casper was forced to call a retreat after reaching the KM4 junction in downtown Mogadishu, where they came under intense rifle and RPG fire. Reinforcements were unable to push further and it consequently took several hours to muster a force capable of pushing into the city.

Prior to the operation, there was no contingency planning or coordination with U.N. forces; consequently, the recovery of the surrounded American troops was significantly complicated and delayed. The mission had been kept secret even from top UN commanders, out of fear of tipping off Somali informants. Several UN contingents were hesitant to join the rescue operation. A relief column was hastily formed, primarily composed of Malaysian mechanized infantry companies, a Pakistani tank platoon, and US infantry. At 11 pm, this convoy, consisting of around 100 vehicles - including four Pakistani M48 tanks, M113 APC&#x27;s, Malaysian Condor APCs, American HMMWVs, and multiple M939 five-ton flatbed trucks - advanced into the city led by the Pakistani tanks. This extensive column, spanning two miles, received air support from additional Black Hawks, OH-58&#x27;s and Cobra attack helicopters provided by the 10th Mountain Division QRF. At the same time, Task Force Ranger&#x27;s &quot;Little Birds&quot; helicopters were focused on safeguarding the crew and rescuers of the downed Super 61. The convoy experienced significant losses, with many wounded and several killed.

As the convoy navigated through downtown Mogadishu and proceeded onto National Street, the first two Malaysian armored vehicles, which were carrying US troops, mistakenly deviated from their path. They were hit concurrently by RPG-7 and emplaced heavy machine gun fire, resulting in the death of a Malaysian driver and injuries to numerous others. To find immediate cover, a US lieutenant detonated an explosive charge on a neighboring wall, enabling the troops to seek refuge in a nearby courtyard. After two Malaysian APC&#x27;s were destroyed, the Pakistani tanks became target for the RPG&#x27;s, and responded by firing back into the city with their 105 mm guns. As the convoy was pelted by heavy automatic weapons fire, American Lt. Colonel Bill David ordered the force to push forward, knowing that staying in the kill zone meant certain destruction. While driving on National Street, the convoy faced a series of ambushes, battling its way for the subsequent three hours before eventually splitting into two groups.

Around the Olympic Hotel, one of the convoys came under a significant volume of fire, resulting in several more casualties and leading to the Malaysian APC&#x27;s refusing to advance further into the heavy barrage. Mk19-equipped US Humvee&#x27;s fired a large volume of 40 mm grenades to clear out key Somali firing points around the hotel, while US troops dismounted and began engaging with Somali fighters in street skirmishes in order to advance. At 1:55 am on 4 October 1993, the relief convoy reached Task Force Ranger forces.

===Mogadishu Mile and conclusion===

Though Mohamed Farah Aidid had hours earlier given the order to Colonel Sharif Hassan Giumale to prevent the escape of any American soldiers, he had begun to become increasingly concerned with the mounting Somali death toll and the prospect of inviting a large scale retaliation if the remaining U.S. troops holding out were killed. Aidid believed he had already inflicted heavy casualties on the Americans and with Durant now in his possession as hostage, he claimed in an interview with journalists to have ordered a corridor to be opened up as dawn broke. Despite Aidid&#x27;s command, U.N. forces faced fierce shooting until they withdrew. Historian Stephen Biddle noted, &quot;it was the UN, not the SNA, that disengaged to end the fighting. The relief column that ultimately extracted TF Ranger had to fight its way into and out of the Bakara Market; SNA fighters were resisting fiercely until UN forces crossed out of Aideed&#x27;s zone of control and withdrew to their bases.&quot;

While leaving the crash site, a group of Rangers and Delta operators led by SSG John R. Dycus realized that there was no room left in the vehicles for them and instead used the vehicles as cover. Forced to depart the city on foot, they proceeded to a rendezvous point at the intersection of Hawlwadig Road and National Street. This has been commonly referred to as the &quot;Mogadishu Mile&quot;. In the last few panicked minutes of the battle, with the convoy operating in a long column with staggered stops and starts, some vehicles ended up making a dash to Mogadishu Stadium, accidentally leaving behind soldiers and forcing them to trek on foot. As the convoy drove back to base AH-1 Cobras and Little Birds provided covering fire overhead while Pakistani tanks fired at any buildings in the city where they had received hostile fire.

Ten minutes later, the convoy reached the safety of the Pakistani base and a field medical hospital set up. The battle was over by 06:30 on Monday, 4 October. U.S. forces were finally evacuated to the U.N. base by the armored convoy. By 7 am, all survivors had reached safety at an aid station inside the stadium on 21 October Road.

==Aftermath==
After the battle, the bodies of several of the conflict&#x27;s U.S. casualties (Black Hawk &quot;Super 64&quot; crewmembers and their defenders, Delta Force soldiers MSG Gordon and SFC Shughart) were dragged through Mogadishu&#x27;s streets by a large crowd of Somalis. After being asked to justify the incident in an interview with American television, Captain Haad of Somali National Alliance claimed that the bodies of the U.S. soldiers had been dragged through the streets by enraged civilians/irregulars who had lost dozens of friends and family, and that the actual SNA soldiers had not partaken in the incident. He would further point to the July 12, 1993, Abdi House Raid that had first led the SNA to begin target U.S. soldiers saying, &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t you be very sorry about 73 of our elder men, of our religious leaders, of our most prominent people, having their bodies mutilated—we collected parts of their bodies from the building in which they were attacked—if you were a son of one of those people killed on that day, what would be your situation, how would you feel?&quot; Several days after the incident, the SNA issued a public appeal, stating that despite the &quot;wanton destruction and suffering beyond human comprehension&quot; inflicted by UNOSOM II and US forces, the alliance urged respect towards the deceased, injured, and prisoners of war; in accordance with Islamic principles.

On 6 October 1993, U.S. President Bill Clinton would personally order General Joseph P. Hoar to cease all combat operations against Somali National Alliance, except in self defense. General Hoar would proceed to relay the stand down order to Generals William F. Garrison of Task Force Ranger and Thomas M. Montgomery of the American Quick Reaction Force. The following day on 7 October, Clinton publicly announced a major change in course in the mission. Substantial U.S. forces would be sent to Somalia as short term reinforcements, but all American forces would be withdrawn from the country by the end of March 1994. He would firmly defend American policy in Somalia but admitted that it had been a mistake for American forces to be drawn into the decision &quot;to personalize the conflict&quot; to Aidid. He would go on to reappoint the former U.S. Special Envoy for Somalia Robert B. Oakley to signal the administrations return to focusing on political reconciliation. Clinton expressed surprise that the battle had even occurred and later claimed that he had decided on a diplomatic solution before the incident. Despite his apparent reservations, there had been no direct orders previously given to Task Force Ranger to halt operations against the SNA. The stand down order given to U.S. forces in Somalia led other UNOSOM II contingents to effectively avoid any confrontation with the SNA. This led to the majority of UNOSOM patrols in Mogadishu to cease and numerous checkpoints in SNA controlled territory to be abandoned.

On 9 October 1993, Special Envoy Robert B. Oakley arrived in Mogadishu to obtain the release of captured troops and to consolidate a ceasefire with the Somali National Alliance. Oakley and General Anthony Zinni would both engage in direct negotiations with representatives of the SNA. It was made clear that the manhunt was over, but that no conditions put forward by the SNA would be accepted for the release of prisoners of war. On 14 October, Aidid announced in a brief appearance on CNN the release of Black Hawk pilot Michael Durant. Three months later all SNA prisoners in U.N. custody were released including Aidid&#x27;s lieutenants Omar Salad Elmi and Mohamed Hassan Awale, who had been the targets of the 3 October raid.

=== Result of the battle ===
Six months after the Battle of Mogadishu all U.S. forces would pull out of Somalia, leaving behind a 20,000 man UNOSOM force that would withdraw in 1995.

Two weeks after the battle, General Garrison, in a handwritten letter to President Clinton, took full responsibility for the battle&#x27;s outcome. He would argue that Task Force Ranger had met their objective—capturing the targets of value. General Garrison had noted before the Battle of Mogadishu that if a serious firefight was had with the SNA, &quot;...we&#x27;ll win the gunfight, but we might lose the war.&quot;

The SNA leadership had the express goal of expelling U.S. forces from Somalia following the Abdi House Raid, and knew that the Americans would not be able to tolerate casualties, especially in a conflict they had no real stake. They believed that inflicting any notable casualties on the Americans would cause Congress and the public to turn against participation in UNOSOM II and withdraw from Somalia. The SNA&#x27;s objective was not to achieve a tactical military victory against the Americans and UNOSOM, but to sap their will to continue fighting and force a complete disengagement from Somalia. In &quot;Losing Mogadishu: Testing US Policy in Somalia,&quot; Johnathan Stevenson argued that the Americans had not recognized that, much like the North Vietnamese guerrillas, the Somali National Alliance was deliberately executing a military philosophy of attrition in order to achieve victory in spite of a high kill ratio, knowing they could absorb far more losses than the Americans would be able to tolerate.

===Known casualties and losses===
====Somalia====
The Somali casualties were a mixture of militiamen, irregulars/volunteers, and local civilians, and the exact number of dead is unknown. Estimates greatly vary from several hundred to several thousand militiamen and civilians killed, with injuries around 800–4,000. The International Committee of the Red Cross estimated that 200 Somalis were killed and several hundred wounded in the fighting. Doctors Without Borders reported 200 deaths and 700 injured. Somali estimates placed casualties at 312 dead, 814 wounded. The Somali National Alliance reported 133 of their fighters had been killed during the battle. Aidid himself claimed that 315—civilians and militia—were killed and 812 wounded, figures which the Red Cross considered &#x27;plausible&#x27;. Mark Bowden&#x27;s book &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; claims 500 Somalis killed and more than 1,000 wounded.

Most of the Somali fighter&#x27;s death toll is attributed to the attack helicopters, in particular AH-6 Little Birds helicopters providing continuous support to the US ground forces. The Little Birds were equipped with 2.75- inch rockets and miniguns and repeated strafing runs held many insurgents at bay during the battle. According to American pilots interviewed in the 1994 book &quot;Mogadishu: Heroism and Tragedy,&quot; tens of thousands of rockets had been fired from AH-6 Little Birds during the battle. Ambassador Robert B. Oakley, the U.S. special representative to Somalia, is quoted as saying: &quot;My own personal estimate is that there must have been 1,500 to 2,000 Somalis killed and wounded that day, because that battle was a true battle...Helicopter gunships were being used as well as all sorts of automatic weapons on the ground by the U.S. and the United Nations. The Somalis, by and large, were using automatic rifles and grenade launchers and it was a very nasty fight, as intense as almost any battle you would find.&quot;

Somali civilians suffered heavy casualties due to the dense urban character of the portion of Mogadishu that fighting took place in. According to Captain Haad of the Somali National Alliance, the civilian death toll was &quot;...almost uncountable, because the place where the fire took place is one of the busiest sectors of Mogadishu...each bullet fired in one direction might have killed four or five or six persons, because the place is very populous.&quot; According to American war correspondent Scott Peterson, about one-third of the Somali casualties were women and children. The non-SNA volunteers, mostly untrained civilians turned combatant with grievances against UNOSOM troops, were a significant issue for Somali National Alliance commanders as they complicated situation on the ground and often got themselves killed with their inexperience. Experienced soldiers were seen pleading with enraged crowds of Somalis not to go near the crash sites as the Americans were spraying into the approaching masses. One high-ranking SNA official complained after the battle, &quot;...everybody tried to attack, they came this way, they went that way. If people had left it to the militia and the officers, it would have been no problem.&quot;

====United States====
At the time, the battle was the deadliest United States Army/Marines fighting since the Vietnam War. Two days after, a 19th soldier, Delta operator SFC Matt Rierson, was killed in a mortar attack. That same day, a team on special mission &quot;Super 64&quot; incurred two wounded.

The U.S. Department of Defense initially reported that five American soldiers had been killed. Post-action accounting eventually reached a total of 18 U.S. soldiers killed in action, and another 84 wounded in action.

==== Pakistan ====
One Pakistani soldier was killed and 10 disappeared during the rescue attempt and assault. Tanks of 7 Lancer Regiment and 19th Lancers were used for the rescue. Italian Lieutenant General Bruno Loi said Italian troops had picked up 30 of the wounded Pakistani soldiers. The city&#x27;s two main hospitals reported that 23 Somalis had been killed and that more than 100 had been wounded.

====Malaysia====
Lance Corporal Mat Aznan Awang was a 33-year-old soldier of the 19th Battalion, Royal Malay Regiment of the Malaysian Army ( promoted to Corporal). Driving a Malaysian Condor armoured personnel carrier, he was killed when his vehicle was hit by an RPG in the early hours of 4 October. Corporal Mat Aznan Awang was awarded the Seri Pahlawan Gagah Perkasa medal (Gallant Warrior/Warrior of Extreme Valor).

=== Alleged links with Al-Qaeda ===
Members of Al-Qaeda are alleged to have been involved in the training and funding of Somali National Alliance forces, claims which have been widely disputed. There is no evidence that al-Qaeda was involved in training SNA forces or that the group participated in any of the battle between Somali and US/UN forces. The Somali National Alliance received some expert guidance in shooting down helicopters from fundamentalist Islamic fighters, who had experience fighting Russian helicopters during the Soviet–Afghan War. Dozens of Somalis trained by the Afghan Mujahideen while participating abroad in the Soviet-Afghan War had returned to join the war against the Americans and UNOSOM II in Mogadishu. The maximum extent of possible support from Al-Qaeda is generally believed to have been restricted to supplying weapons and training to Somali groups fighting international forces during 1993. Al-Qaeda defector Jamal al-Fadl claimed that the group had trained the fighters responsible for shooting down the US helicopters, and Mohammed Odeh reportedly stated that he had gone to Somalia to train fighters and provide money. Mark Bowden contended that before the battle, the Al-Qaeda coached the Somali militia in using rocket-propelled grenades, specifically aiming for the tail rotors of US Black Hawks. Correspondent Jonathan Randal notes no evidence exists to back these asserations, and that downing helicopters by aiming for their rotors had been a well known combat technique since the Vietnam War. American Ambassador Robert B. Oakley, who had access to US and UN intelligence in Somalia, insisted that he had investigated all evidence of Al-Qaeda involvement and found nothing to support the allegations.

In 1996 and 1997, Osama Bin Laden claimed in interviews with al-Quds al-Arabi and CNN that &quot;Arab holy warriors&quot; played a role in the battles against US troops. However, these assertions were discredited by eyewitnesses in Mogadishu and dismissed by numerous observers as groundless and self-aggrandizing claims. While Bin Laden hinted at involvement, he never explicitly claimed that Al-Qaeda had participated in the Battle of Mogadishu. Deputy to Osama Bin Laden, Mohammed Atef, visited Somalia during 1992 and 1993, but Aidid&#x27;s men had forced him to flee for his life from Mogadishu on a Cessna plane. During a 1998 interview with ABC&#x27;s John Miller, bin Laden clarified his earlier statement, claiming that some of his men were present in Somalia at the time, rather than having actively participated in the fighting. Ahmed Godane, the leader of the al-Qaeda allegiant militant group Al-Shabaab, claimed that three members of the group were in Mogadishu during the battle. This has also been dismissed by observers as a self-serving proclamation. Former FBI agent Ali Soufan claims an Al-Qaeda operative named Zachariah al-Tunisi downed a Black Hawk. A November 1998 indictment named al-Qaeda members Muhammed Atef, Fazul Abdullah Mohammed, Mohammed Odeh, Ahmed Mohammed Hamed Ali, and military chief Abu Ubaidah al-Banshiri for providing &quot;military assistance and training to Somali tribes opposed to the United Nations&#x27; intervention in Somalia.&quot; A document recovered from al-Qaeda operative Wadih el-Hage&#x27;s computer &quot;made a tentative link between al-Qaeda and the killing of American servicemen in Somalia,&quot; and were used to indict bin Laden in June 1998, though the specific charges on Somalia were later dropped.

Claims of Al-Qaeda presence during the battle have been firmly disputed by both independent and Aidid affiliated Somali accounts. Veteran Somali journalist Abdishakur Mire Aadan notes that Islamist participants, including any that had possible connections to Al-Qaeda, were all Somali. Aadan asserts that claims by western accounts of foreign participation on the Somali side during the battle are completely baseless. Several fighters of the Somali islamist group, Al-Itihaad Al-Islaamyia directly participated in the battle, and allegations of Al-Qaeda links during the conflict with US/UN forces during 1993 were largely linked to the group. Alex de Waal, Lawrence Wright, Jonathan Randal and other journalists/academics have noted that despite assertions by some parties of an Al-Qaeda presence during the battle, no evidence exists to support these claims. Correspondent Scott Peterson, after extensive interviews with SNA personnel and other Somalis involved in the conflict with UNOSOM wrote, &quot;Somalis laugh at this claim that bin Laden helped them and say—unanimously—that they never even heard of bin Laden until he began boasting about Somalia years later.&quot;

=== Military fallout ===

In a national security policy review session held in the White House on 6 October 1993, U.S. President Bill Clinton directed the Acting Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral David E. Jeremiah, to stop all actions by U.S. forces against Aidid except those required in self-defense. He reappointed Ambassador Robert B. Oakley as special envoy to Somalia in an attempt to broker a peace settlement and then announced that all U.S. forces would withdraw from Somalia no later than 31 March 1994. On 15 December 1993, U.S. Secretary of Defense Les Aspin stepped down, taking much of the blame for his decision to refuse requests for tanks and armored vehicles in support of the mission. Garrison would write, however, that Aspin was not to blame for the events in Mogadishu. It&#x27;s also since been noted that the equipment may not have arrived in time to make a difference. A few hundred U.S. Marines remained offshore to assist with any noncombatant evacuation mission that might occur regarding the 1,000-plus U.S. civilians and military advisers remaining as part of the U.S. liaison mission. The Ready Battalion of the 24th Infantry Division, 1–64 Armor, composed 1,300 troops of Task Force Rogue, including the bulk of 1-64 Armor and Infantry troops from her sister battalion 3-15 Infantry. This was the first time M1 Abrams tanks were delivered by air, using the C-5 Galaxies, which delivered 18 M1 tanks and 44 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, while the balance of Task Force Rogue&#x27;s equipment and vehicles were delivered via a roll-on/roll-off ship sent from Fort Stewart (Hinesville), Georgia, to Mogadishu to provide armored support for U.S. forces.

On 4 February 1994, the U.N. Security Council passed Resolution 897, which set a process for completing the UNOSOM II mission by March 1995, with the withdrawal of U.N. troops from Somalia at that time. In August 1994, the U.N. requested that the U.S. lead a coalition to aid in the final withdrawal of the UNOSOM II forces from Somalia. On 16 December 1994, Operation United Shield was approved by President Clinton and launched on 14 January 1995. On 7 February 1995, the Operation United Shield multi-national fleet arrived and began the withdrawal of UNOSOM II&#x27;s forces. On 6 March 1995, all of the remaining U.N. troops were withdrawn, ending UNOSOM II.

===Policy changes and political implications===
The United Nation&#x27;s three consecutive humanitarian missions in Somalia (UNOSOM I 1992, UNITAF 1992–1993, UNOSOM II 1993–1995) were seen by many as a failure, and the evolving civil war that began in 1986 continues as of 2024. The Clinton administration in particular endured considerable criticism for the operation&#x27;s outcome. The main elements of the criticism surround: the administration&#x27;s decision to leave the region before completing the operation&#x27;s humanitarian and security objectives; the perceived failure to recognize the threat al-Qaeda elements posed in the region; and the threat against U.S. security interests at home. Critics claim that Osama bin Laden and other members of al-Qaeda provided support and training to Mohammed Farrah Aidid&#x27;s forces. Osama bin Laden even denigrated the administration&#x27;s decision to prematurely depart the region, stating that it displayed &quot;the weakness, feebleness and cowardliness of the U.S. soldier&quot;.

The loss of U.S. military personnel during the Battle of Mogadishu and television images of American soldiers being dragged through the streets by Somalis evoked public outcry. The Clinton administration responded by scaling down U.S. humanitarian efforts in the region.

On 26 September 2006, in an interview on Fox News with Chris Wallace, former President Bill Clinton gave his version of events surrounding the mission in Somalia. Clinton defended his exit strategy for U.S. forces and denied that the departure was premature. He said he had resisted calls from Conservative Republicans for an immediate departure: &quot;...[Conservative Republicans] were all trying to get me to withdraw from Somalia in 1993 the next day after we were involved in &#x27;Black Hawk Down,&#x27; and I refused to do it and stayed six months and had an orderly transfer to the United Nations.&quot; Clinton&#x27;s remarks would suggest the U.S. was not deterred from pursuing their humanitarian goals because of the loss of U.S. forces during the battle. In the same interview, he stated that, at the time, there was &quot;not a living soul in the world who thought that Osama bin Laden had anything to do with Black Hawk down or was paying any attention to it or even knew al-Qaeda was a growing concern in October of &#x27;93&quot;, and that the mission was strictly humanitarian.

Fear of a repeat of the events in Somalia shaped U.S. policy in subsequent years, with many commentators identifying the Battle of Mogadishu&#x27;s graphic consequences as the key reason behind the U.S.&#x27;s decision to not intervene in later conflicts such as the Rwandan genocide of 1994. According to the U.S.&#x27;s former deputy special envoy to Somalia, Walter Clarke: &quot;The ghosts of Somalia continue to haunt U.S. policy. Our lack of response in Rwanda was a fear of getting involved in something like a Somalia all over again.&quot; Likewise, during the Iraq War when four American contractors were killed in the city of Fallujah, then dragged through the streets and desecrated by an angry mob, direct comparisons by the American media to the Battle of Mogadishu led to the First Battle of Fallujah.

Fears of committing large numbers of US troops to Somalia in the years following the battle in part led to the CIA using Somali warlords as proxies against the Islamic Courts Union in 2006.

==Published accounts==
In 1999, writer Mark Bowden published the book &quot;Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War&quot;, which chronicles the events that surrounded the battle. The book was based on his series of columns for &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; about the battle and the men who fought.

On the battles 30th anniversary, Mohammed Abdi Elmi, a high ranking member of the Somali National Alliance and special assistant to General Aidid, released the book &quot;The Battle of Mogadishu: A Failed New World Order&quot; (2023) detailing the Somali perspective of the conflict.

&quot;Falcon Brigade: Combat and Command in Somalia and Haiti&quot;, by Lawrence E. Casper. Casper was the 10th Mountain Division&#x27;s Falcon Brigade and QRF Commander during the TF Ranger rescue effort.

Black Hawk pilot Michael Durant told his story of being shot down and captured by a mob of Somalis in his 2003 book &quot;In the Company of Heroes&quot;.

In 2011, Staff Sergeant Keni Thomas, a U.S. Army Ranger recounted the combat experience in a memoir titled &quot;Get It On!: What It Means to Lead the Way&quot;.

Howard E. Wasdin&#x27;s &quot;SEAL Team Six&quot; (2011) includes a section about his time in Mogadishu including the &quot;Pasha&quot; CIA safe house and multiple operations including the Battle of Mogadishu where he was severely wounded.

Lieutenant Colonel Michael Whetstone, Company Commander of Charlie Company 2–14 Infantry, published his memoirs of the heroic rescue operation of Task Force Ranger in his book &quot;Madness in Mogadishu&quot; (2013).

Paul R. Howe (Delta Force) was the leader of the assault team that went in to rescue Army Rangers and Delta Force members. He later consulted for Mark Bowden&#x27;s 1999 book &quot;Black Hawk Down: A History of Modern War&quot;.

===Film===
Bowden&#x27;s book has been adapted into the film &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; (2001), produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Ridley Scott. Like the book, the film describes events surrounding the operation, but there are differences between the book and the film, such as Rangers marking targets at night by throwing strobe lights at them, when in reality the Rangers marked their own positions and close air support targeted everything else.

2023 Malaysian film &quot;&quot;, directed and produced by Adrian Teh, retells the story of Malaysian contingent of UNOSOM II (also known as MALBATT) involvement during the rescue operation in the battle. The film itself become the first ever Malaysian film that formatted for IMAX.

===Video Game===
The 2003 NovaLogic video game &quot;Delta Force: Black Hawk Down&quot; depicts a fictionalized version of the Somali Civil War, Battle of Mogadishu and the Mogadishu Mile event. Missions take place in Mogadishu and Jubba Valley inspired by the Black Hawk Down movie.

===Documentaries===
The American series PBS Frontline aired a documentary titled &quot;Ambush in Mogadishu&quot; in 1998.

&quot;The True Story of Black Hawk Down&quot; (2003) is a TV documentary which premièred on The History Channel. It was directed by David Keane.

The American Heroes Channel television series, &quot;Black Ops&quot;, aired an episode titled &quot;The Real Black Hawk Down&quot; in June 2014.

The National Geographic Channel television series, &quot;No Man Left Behind&quot;, aired an episode titled &quot;The Real Black Hawk Down&quot; on 28 June 2016.

The &quot;Seconds from Disaster&quot; television series spotlighted the raid-and-rescue mission in the season 7 episode &quot;Chopper Down&quot;, which aired in February 2018.

===Rangers return in 2013===

In March 2013, two survivors from Task Force Ranger returned to Mogadishu with a film crew to shoot a short film, &quot;Return to Mogadishu: Remembering Black Hawk Down&quot;, which debuted in October 2013 on the 20th anniversary of the battle. Author Jeff Struecker and country singer-songwriter Keni Thomas relived the battle as they drove through the Bakaara Market in armored vehicles and visited the Wolcott crash site.

===&quot;Super 61&quot; returns to the US===

In August 2013, remains of &quot;Super 61&quot;, consisting of the mostly intact main rotor and parts of the nose section, were extracted from the crash site and returned to the United States through the efforts of David Snelson and Alisha Ryu. They are on display at the Airborne &amp; Special Operations Museum at Fort Bragg, Fayetteville, North Carolina. The exhibit features immersive dioramas and artifacts from the battle including the wreckage of &quot;Super 61&quot;, the first Black Hawk helicopter shot down during the battle, and &quot;Super 64&quot;.

As of October 2018, a fully restored Super 68 is on display at the Army Aviation Museum in Fort Novosel, Alabama.

<doc id="106352" wikidata="Q756329" url="?curid=106352" title="Atlantic City (1980 film)">
<text>Atlantic City () is a 1980 romantic crime film directed by Louis Malle from a screenplay by John Guare. It stars Burt Lancaster and Susan Sarandon in the leading roles, with a supporting cast featuring Kate Reid, Michel Piccoli, Robert Joy, Hollis McLaren, and Al Waxman. A co-production between French and Canadian companies filmed in late 1979, it was released in France and Germany in September 1980 and in the United States later that year by Paramount Pictures.

The film opened to critical acclaim and was nominated for the Big Five Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (for Lancaster), Best Actress (for Sarandon), and Best Original Screenplay, but did not win in any category. In Canada, it won Genie Awards for Best Performance by a Foreign Actress (for Sarandon), Best Supporting Actress (for Reid), and Best Art Direction, with three additional nominations. In France, it was nominated for the César Awards for Best Original Screenplay and Best Music.

In 2003, &quot;Atlantic City&quot; was among the 25 motion pictures added annually to the United States National Film Registry of the Library of Congress, being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and recommended for preservation.

==Plot==
Sally Matthews is a young waitress from Saskatchewan, Canada, working at an oyster bar in an Atlantic City casino. She has dreams of becoming a blackjack dealer, going through dealer training under the tutelage of Joseph. Joseph, from France, encourages her to learn French and become a dealer in Monte Carlo.

Sally&#x27;s estranged husband Dave and her pregnant sister Chrissie show up one day with the intention of selling a $10,000 () bag of cocaine he had stolen from a mob dead drop in Philadelphia. Sally is outraged to see him, as he had impregnated Chrissie and run off with her. Dave meets Lou, an aging former gangster who lives in Sally&#x27;s apartment building and runs a small time numbers game in poor areas of the city; Lou also acts as a caretaker for Grace, a seemingly bedridden, aging beauty queen whose gangster husband he used to work under, and who constantly berates and demeans him. Dave convinces Lou to sell the cocaine for him, but as Lou sells the first batch to Alfie, who runs an illegal poker game in a hotel room, Dave is attacked and killed by the mobsters from whom he had stolen the drugs.

Lou is left with the remaining cocaine and continues to sell it to impress Sally, whom he has long pined for, with money. Sally and Lou make love one day, but she returns to her apartment to find it trashed; she has been tracked down by Dave&#x27;s killers, who beat her to find out if she has the drugs. They leave, but Lou laments not being able to protect her. Grace also reveals that Lou was a small-time crook and nowhere near as competent as he pretends.

Sally is fired from the casino when her late husband&#x27;s criminal record is discovered. Lou sells most of the remainder of the cocaine, while both Sally and the mobsters discover Lou&#x27;s affiliation with Dave. The mobsters corner them one night, but are killed when Lou produces a gun and shoots them. He and Sally then steal their car and leave Atlantic City. That night, from a motel, they watch the TV news reporting on the killing. A police sketch of the suspect is shown. It looks nothing like Lou. Lou is overjoyed with relief and pride. He confesses to Sally that this was the first time he has ever killed anyone.

At the motel the next morning, Lou takes the phone to the bathroom to call Grace and brag about the killings. Sally wakes and takes half of the money with the intention of sneaking off; Lou witnesses this, allowing her to leave and giving her the car keys so she can escape to France, rather than go to Miami with him. Lou returns to Atlantic City to be with Grace. Working together, they sell the remaining portion of the cocaine and walk off arm in arm with renewed respect for each other.

==Cast==

Other cast members in the film include Moses Znaimer (Felix), Angus MacInnes (Vinnie) and Sean Sullivan (Buddy) as a trio of mob thugs, Louis Del Grande as casino manager Mr. Shapiro, Norma Dell&#x27;Agnese as Jeanne, John McCurry as Fred, Cec Linder as the hospital president, Sean McCann as a police detective, and Harvey Atkin as a bus driver.

Wallace Shawn, one of the subjects of Malle&#x27;s film &quot;My Dinner with Andre&quot;, makes a cameo appearance as a waiter.

==Production==

&quot;Atlantic City&quot; was filmed on location in and around Atlantic City and South Jersey, Philadelphia, and New York City. Although filmed in the United States, the film was a co-production between companies based in France and Canada.

=== Development and writing ===
The production companies allotted Louis Malle the money to make a film with the stipulation that it be made before the year 1979 ended. Malle had a difficult time finding the right script to direct and with time running out his then girlfriend Susan Sarandon suggested using a story written by her friend John Guare, a playwright most notable for his plays &quot;House of Blue Leaves&quot; and &quot;Six Degrees of Separation&quot;. Guare suggested that the story take place in Atlantic City, which was still for the most part suffering from the urban deterioration that prompted the legalization of gambling as a solution to save the city. The three met over dinner in early 1979 to work out quirks in the script and began shooting within a few months.

=== Casting ===
Aside from Burt Lancaster, Susan Sarandon, and local extras, most of the cast originated from Canada or France. The film allowed Canadian actors such as Al Waxman to successfully transition into American film and television roles.

=== Filming ===
Principal photography commenced on October 31, 1979, and was largely finished by December 30 (although a few exterior and location shots were filmed until January 5, 1980). Malle filmed at an opportune time in that he was able to capture old Atlantic City: gambling was still in its early stages there, with only two casino hotels open (Resorts and Caesars; Bally&#x27;s Park Place opened on December 30 toward the end of the principal photography). Most of the city&#x27;s old resorts and entertainment piers were still standing, albeit in a severe state of disrepair. Within a couple of years of the filming, most of these old hotels would fall victim to the wrecking ball as they were replaced with new casinos. To frame the picture, Malle foreshadows the great transition of the famous resort town in the opening credits by featuring footage of the implosion of the once-grand and historic Traymore Hotel on the Atlantic City Boardwalk.

The opening shot of the old Traymore Hotel being demolished is shown to convey the notion that the city&#x27;s old hotels were being demolished to make way for the new casinos. However, the Traymore was in fact demolished in 1972, years before the gambling referendum passed in New Jersey. The referendum passed in 1976 and the first hotel to open up was Resorts, formerly the Chalfonte-Haddon Hall, in 1978.

When Dave and Chrissie are seen hitchhiking into Atlantic City from Philadelphia, they pass a large model elephant on their way into town. The elephant, named Lucy, was a tourist attraction built in 1881 to lure potential land buyers to South Atlantic City (now called Margate), a small town south of Atlantic City. The model elephant had been left to deteriorate over the years; on the brink of its demolition in 1971, the residents of Margate had raised the money to have it restored. Today, Lucy still stands in Margate and is on the National Register of Historic Places.

The club where Dave and Lou meet was Club Harlem, which opened in 1935 on Kentucky Avenue, and became the premier nightclub for black tourists visiting Atlantic City. The club opened and closed frequently from 1968 on and eventually closed forever at the end of the eighties. It was torn down in 1992.

Scenes also were shot in the Knife and Fork Inn and White House Sub Shop, both landmarks in Atlantic City.

=== Music ===
Louis Malle hired composer Michel Legrand to write a score for the film, which he did. In the end, however, Malle decided against using a score for the film, and opted for all the music in the film to be diegetic: the only music used is that which exists in the world of the characters (i.e. radios, musical instruments, etc.). The music that Susan Sarandon&#x27;s character plays from her tape player is the aria &quot;Casta Diva&quot; from Vincenzo Bellini&#x27;s opera &quot;Norma&quot;. Featured in the beginning of the film, when Dave and Chrissie enter Resorts, and during the credits is the song &quot;On the Boardwalk (In Atlantic City)&quot;.

== Reception ==
&quot;Atlantic City&quot; opened to widespread critical acclaim. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 100% &quot;Fresh&quot; rating out of 37 critics&#x27; reviews. The critics consensus reads &quot;Bittersweet and reflective, &quot;Atlantic City&quot; is a modest romance given raw power by Burt Lancaster and Susan Sarandon&#x27;s heartfelt performances along with director Louis Malle&#x27;s eccentric eye for detail.&quot;

<doc id="106353" wikidata="Q15980253" url="?curid=106353" title="On Golden Pond (play)">
<text>On Golden Pond is a 1979 play by Ernest Thompson. The plot focuses on an aging couple Ethel and Norman Thayer, who spend each summer at their home on a lake called Golden Pond. During the year the story takes place, they are visited by daughter Chelsea with her fiancé Billy Ray and his son Billy Ray Jr. The play explores the often turbulent relationship the young woman shared with her father growing up, and the difficulties faced by a couple in the twilight years of a long marriage.

== Synopsis ==

===Act 1===

;May
Norman and Ethel arrive at the summer house, finding it in need of repairs. There are hints that Norman is having problems with his memory.

;June
To Ethel&#x27;s chagrin, Norman makes a nominal effort to find a job in the classified ads. The mailman Charlie stops by and reminisces about the Thayers&#x27; daughter Chelsea whom he used to date. A letter arrives from Chelsea saying that she is coming from California with her boyfriend Bill to celebrate Norman&#x27;s 80th birthday. It becomes clearer that Norman is struggling with memory loss as he continues to forget names and places that should be familiar.

;July
Chelsea arrives with Bill Ray and his 13-year-old son Billy Ray Jr. Chelsea asks her parents if Billy Jr. can stay with them while she and Bill go to Europe. Norman (a bit reluctantly) and Ethel agree to keep Billy Jr.

===Act 2===

;August
Norman and Billy Jr. have become friends, and spend much of their time fishing. Chelsea returns, and reveals that she and Bill are now married. Ethel shows her impatience with Chelsea&#x27;s habit of bitterly harping on the past. Chelsea confronts her father about their troubled relationship, and the two have a reconciliation.

;September
Norman and Ethel are packing to leave for the winter. Chelsea calls, and they agree to go visit her in California. Norman seems to suffer a heart attack (whilst picking up a box of his mother-in-law&#x27;s heavy china) but recovers, and the pair leave their home along Golden Pond.

== Productions ==
After five previews, the first Broadway production, directed by Craig Anderson, set and costume design by Steven Rubin, and lighting design by Craig Miller, opened on February 28, 1979 at the New Apollo Theatre, where it ran for 126 performances. The cast was Tom Aldredge (Norman Thayer Jr.), Frances Sternhagen (Ethel Thayer), Ronn Carroll (Charlie Martin), Barbara Andres (Chelsea Thayer Wayne), Mark Bendo (Billy Ray), and Stan Lachow (Bill Ray). After a summer break, it reopened with the same cast on September 12 at the Century Theatre, a small playhouse in the basement of the Paramount Hotel, where it ran for an additional 256 performances. Ben Slack replaced Ronn Carroll during the course of the run at the Century Theatre.

After 19 previews, a Broadway revival with an African American cast directed by Leonard Foglia and produced by Jeffrey Finn opened on April 7, 2005 at the Cort Theatre, where it ran for 93 performances. James Earl Jones and Leslie Uggams headed the cast. Jones, who often was ill during the run, eventually was diagnosed with pneumonia, forcing the production to a sudden close.

Michael Learned and Tom Bosley starred in a 2006–2007 U.S. national tour produced by Finn. Jack Klugman headlined a 2008 tour.

== Adaptations ==
The play was adapted for the screen written by Thompson in 1981. The film &quot;On Golden Pond&quot; was released in December 1981, directed by Mark Rydell and produced by Bruce Gilbert with Henry Fonda, Katharine Hepburn and Jane Fonda in the starring cast.

In 2001, CBS aired a live television adaptation of the play that was publicized heavily in the press due to the reunion of &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; stars Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer in the lead roles. It also starred Glenne Headly. For Julie Andrews, the broadcast marked her first instance of singing publicly (albeit only a few notes), since throat surgery in 1995 had impaired her singing voice.

<text>Oamaru (; ) is the largest town in North Otago, in the South Island of New Zealand, it is the main town in the Waitaki District. It is south of Timaru and north of Dunedin on the Pacific coast; State Highway 1 and the railway Main South Line connect it to both cities. With a population of , Oamaru is the 28th largest urban area in New Zealand, and the third largest in Otago behind Dunedin and Queenstown. The town is the seat of Waitaki District, which includes the surrounding towns of Kurow, Weston, Palmerston, and Hampden, which combined have a total population of 23,200.

Friendly Bay is a popular recreational area located at the edge of Oamaru Harbour, south of Oamaru&#x27;s main centre. Just to the north of Oamaru is the substantial Alliance Abattoir at Pukeuri, at a major junction with State Highway 83, the main route into the Waitaki Valley. This provides a road link to Kurow, Omarama, Otematata and via the Lindis Pass to Queenstown and Wānaka. Oamaru serves as the eastern gateway to the Mackenzie Basin, via the Waitaki Valley.

Oamaru has been built between the rolling hills of limestone and short stretch of flat land to the sea. This limestone rock is used for the construction of local &quot;Oamaru stone&quot;, sometimes called &quot;Whitestone&quot; buildings.

Oamaru enjoys a protected location in the shelter of Cape Wanbrow. The town was laid out in 1858 by Otago&#x27;s provincial surveyor John Turnbull Thomson, who named the early streets after British rivers, particularly rivers in the northwest and southeast of the country.

The name &quot;Oamaru&quot; derives from the Māori and can be translated as &#x27;the place of Maru&#x27; ( Timaru). The identity of Maru remains open to conjecture.

== History ==

===Māori settlement===
There are some important archaeological sites around Oamaru. Those at the Waitaki River mouth and at Awamoa both date from the Archaic (moa-hunter) phase of Māori culture, when New Zealand&#x27;s human population clustered along the south-east coast from about AD 1100. The Waitaki River mouth had at least 1,200 ovens. Awamoa saw the first archaeological excavation in New Zealand when W.B.D. Mantell dug there at Christmas 1847 and in 1852. Smaller Archaic sites exist at Cape Wanbrow and at Beach Road in central Oamaru. The distinctive Archaic art of the Waitaki Valley rock shelters dates from this period — some of it presumably made by the occupants of these sites. The area also features Classic and Protohistoric sites, from after about AD 1500, at Tamahaerewhenua, Tekorotuaheka, Te Punamaru, Papakaio, and Kakanui.

Māori tradition tells of the ancient people Kahui Tipua building a canoe, &quot;Āraiteuru&quot;, which sailed from southern New Zealand to the ancestral Polynesian homeland, Hawaiki, to obtain kūmara. On its return it became waterlogged off the Waitaki River mouth, lost food baskets at Moeraki beach and ended up wrecked at Matakaea (Shag Point) where it turned into Danger Reef. After the wreck a crew member, Pahihiwitahi, seeking water, discovered the Waitaki River, but on returning south and failing to reach the wreck before dawn he was turned into a hill in the Shag Valley. Modern academics have suggested this tale is an allegorical explanation of the fact that kūmara will not grow south of Banks Peninsula.

===European contact===
On 20 February 1770 James Cook in the &quot;Endeavour&quot; reached a position very close to the Waitaki mouth and &quot;about 3 Miles [5 km] from the shore&quot;, according to his journal. He said the land &quot;here is very low and flat and continues so up to the skirts of the Hills which are at least 4 or 5 Miles [6–8 km] in land. The whole face of the Country appears barren, nor did we see any signs of inhabitants.&quot; He stayed on this part of the coast four days. Sydney Parkinson, the expedition&#x27;s artist, described what seems to be Cape Wanbrow, in Oamaru. On 20 February he wrote &quot;...we were near the land, which formed an agreeable view to the naked eye. The hills were of a moderate height, having flats that extended from them a long way, bordered by a perpendicular rocky cliff next to the sea.&quot;

Māori did live in the area, and sealers visited the coast in 1814. The Creed manuscript, discovered in 2003, records:

Some of the [local] people [had been] absent on a feasting expedition to meet a great party from Taumutu, Akaroa, Orawenua [Arowhenua]. They were returning. The [sealers&#x27;] boat passed on to the Bluff 8 miles [13 km] north of Moeraki where they landed &amp; arranged their boat – &amp; lay down to sleep in their boat. At night Pukuheke, father of Te More, went to the boat, found them asleep &amp; came back to the other Natives south of the Bluff. They went with 100 [men] killing 5 Europeans &amp; eat them. Two of the seven escaped through the darkness of the night &amp; fled as far as Goodwood, Bobby&#x27;s Head, after being 2 days and nights on the way.
Pukuheke&#x27;s party killed and ate these as well. The Pākehā, a party from the &quot;Matilda&quot; (Captain Fowler), under the first mate Robert Brown with two other Europeans and five lascars or Indian seamen, made eight in all, not seven as the manuscript says. They had been sent in an open boat from Stewart Island in search of a party of absconding lascars. Brown must have had some reason for searching for them on the North Otago coast.

After Te Rauparaha&#x27;s sack of the large pā (fortified settlement) at Kaiapoi near modern Christchurch in 1831, refugees came south and gained permission to settle at Kakaunui (Kakanui), and the territory between Pukeuri and Waianakarua, including the site of urban Oamaru, became their domain.

===Nineteenth century onwards===
Whalers sometimes visited this part of the coast in the 1830s. The &quot;Jason&quot;, for example, probably of New London in the United States, Captain Chester, was reported at &quot;Otago Bluff&quot; south of Kakanui, with of oil, on 1 December 1839.

Edward Shortland visited the area in 1844, coming overland from Waikouaiti. On 9 January he recorded &quot;Our path to-day was sometimes along the edge of a low cliff, sometimes along the beach, till we approached Oamaru point, where it turned inland, and crossed a low range of hills, from which we looked over an extensive plain … Towards the afternoon, we ascended a range of hills called Pukeuri, separating this plain from another more extensive. The sky was so remarkably clear that, from the highest point of the pathway, Moeraki was distinctly in view...&quot; He made a map and placed Oamaru on it. He was one of several Europeans who passed through the area on foot in the 1840s. James Saunders became the first European resident of the district some time before 1850 when he settled to trade among the Māori of the Waitaki River mouth.

More European settlers arrived in the Oamaru area in the 1850s. Hugh Robison built and lived in a sod hut by Oamaru Creek in 1853 while establishing his sheep run. J.T. Thomson surveyed the place as a town in 1859, and the Otago Provincial government declared &quot;hundreds&quot; there on 30 November 1860. The town grew as a service-centre for the agricultural/pastoral hinterland between the Kakanui Mountains and the Waitaki River, and rapidly became a major port. A boost was given by public works, including harbour development, and an export trade in wool and grain from the 1860s. Following the loss of a number of vessels off the coast, construction of a breakwater designed by engineer John McGregor started in 1871. The building of this breakwater was influential in the development of new forms of crane. 

For many years there was a commercial and fishing harbour under Cape Wanbrow at Friendly Bay. With the development of pastoralism and the associated frozen-meat industry having its historical origins in New Zealand just south of the town at Totara, Oamaru flourished. Institutions such as the Athenaeum, Chief Post Office and Waitaki Boys&#x27; and Waitaki Girls&#x27; High Schools sprang up. The locally plentiful limestone (Oamaru stone) lent itself to carving and good designers, such as John Lemon (1828–1890), Thomas Forrester (1838–1907) and his son J.M. Forrester (1865–1965), and craftsmen utilised it. By the time of the depression of the 1880s Oamaru was home to an impressive array of buildings and the &quot;best built and most mortgaged town in Australasia&quot;.

A major factor in the near bankruptcy of the town was the construction of the Oamaru Borough Water Race, an aqueduct completed after three years&#x27; work in 1880. This major engineering feat replaced the previous poor water supply, (obtained from the local creek running through the town) with abundant pure water (and energy for industrial machinery driven by water motors) from the Waitaki river and conducted water in an open channel for almost 50 km through hilly farmland from Kurow to the Oamaru reservoir at Ardgowan, until it was decommissioned and abandoned in 1983. Today much of the former infrastructure is still intact and can still be traced. 

The district went &quot;dry&quot; in 1906, and stayed that way until 1960 – the last South Island district to resume alcohol sales.

Development slowed apart from a few years in the 1920s, and in the 1950s, but the population continued to grow until the 1970s. With the closure of the port the local economy began to stall, and New Zealand then went through radical economic restructuring in the mid 1980s – known as &quot;Rogernomics&quot;. North Otago was then hit by two droughts from 1988 to 1989 and again from 1997 to 1999. Oamaru found itself hard hit. In response it started to re-invent itself, becoming one of the first New Zealand towns to realise that its built heritage was an asset.

A public art museum, the Forrester Gallery (whose first curator in 1882 was Thomas Forrester), opened in 1983 in R.A. Lawson&#x27;s neo-classical Bank of New South Wales building. Restoration of other buildings also took place. The Oamaru Whitestone Civic Trust was formed in 1987 with a vision of redeveloping the original commercial and business district of Oamaru&#x27;s Harbour and Tyne Streets, and work began on restoring the historic precinct beside the port, perhaps the most atmospheric urban area in New Zealand. By the early 21st century, &quot;heritage&quot; had become a conspicuous industry and , the number of buildings owned by the Oamaru Whitestone Civic Trust had grown from the original eight to 17.

== Climate ==
The Köppen-Geiger climate classification system classifies the climate of Oamaru as oceanic (Cfb).

== Demographics ==
Oamaru is described by Statistics New Zealand as a medium urban area, which covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Before the 2023 census, Oamaru had a larger boundary, covering . Using that boundary, Oamaru had a population of 13,107 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 801 people (6.5%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 1,077 people (9.0%) since the 2006 census. There were 5,463 households, comprising 6,267 males and 6,840 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.92 males per female, with 2,328 people (17.8%) aged under 15 years, 2,016 (15.4%) aged 15 to 29, 5,439 (41.5%) aged 30 to 64, and 3,324 (25.4%) aged 65 or older.

The percentage of people born overseas was 15.7, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 45.4% had no religion, 43.6% were Christian, 0.2% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.6% were Hindu, 0.4% were Muslim, 0.4% were Buddhist and 1.6% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 1,242 (11.5%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 3,021 (28.0%) people had no formal qualifications. 1,017 people (9.4%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 4,668 (43.3%) people were employed full-time, 1,545 (14.3%) were part-time, and 312 (2.9%) were unemployed.

== Government ==
The mayor of Waitaki District is Gary Kircher.

Oamaru is part of the parliamentary electorate of Waitaki, and since 2023 has been represented by Miles Anderson of the New Zealand National Party.

== Recreation and leisure ==
The beautiful Oamaru Opera House on Thames Street, officially opened on 7 October 1907, is home to much of Oamaru&#x27;s live entertainment and performances. It was restored in 2009. The refurbishment won the Public Architecture category of the 2010 Southern Architecture Awards and the 2011 NZIA Heritage award for Heritage Conservation. Oamaru Opera House is one of the most significant heritage sites in Oamaru, important to the town and nationally to New Zealand.

The Waitaki District Library has branches situated in Oamaru, Palmerston, Kurow, Hampden, Omarama, and Otematata (forming the Waitaki District Libraries syndicate).

Oamaru Public Library began life as the Oamaru Athenaeum and Mechanics Institute in 1878, but by 1973, library services had outgrown the building. A new library building was proposed, situated next-door to the &#x27;old&#x27; Athenaeum library, and the new library was officially opened by the Mayor, Mr R.D. Allen on 19 September 1975.

Oamaru Repertory Theatre is located on Itchen Street and is the home of Oamaru&#x27;s live theatre productions.

== Sports ==
Oamaru has a comprehensive range of community sporting facilities for rugby, tennis, swimming, netball, cricket, golf, hockey, and bowls. Centennial Park is Oamaru&#x27;s major sporting venue, and is the home of North Otago Rugby Football Union and North Otago Cricket. The council also owns and operates the Oamaru Aquatic Centre.

==Notable people==

Many of the early works of Janet Frame, who grew up in the town, reflect Oamaru conditions and Oamaruvians. Other literary associations include those with Owen Marshall, Greg McGee and Fiona Farrell Poole. 

Other notable people born and educated in Oamaru include Des Wilson, founder of the UK homelessness charity, Shelter; Australian Prime Minister Chris Watson; New Zealand politicians Arnold Nordmeyer and William Steward; Cardinal Thomas Stafford Williams; Sir Malcolm Grant, former president and Provost of University College London and subsequently Chairman of NHS England and Chancellor of the University of York; and notably former All Blacks rugby union captain Richie McCaw. 

Fred Allen, an All Black of the 1940s who went on to coach the All Blacks to 14 wins from his 14 tests in the 1960s, was born in Oamaru, though not educated there. Another notable sports person is Gary Robertson, who won gold at the 1972 Olympic Games, Munich, Germany in the NZ Rowing 8. Robertson is the only Olympic gold medalist from Waitaki. He was born in Waimate but grew up in Oamaru and was educated at Waitaki Boys High School.

The world first learned of the death of Robert Scott and the members of his team on their return from the ill-fated expedition to the South Pole by way of a cable sent from Oamaru, on 10 February 1913.

From 1906 to 1944 Frank Milner (1875–1944) was the headteacher at Waitaki Boys&#x27; High School.

Notable students include Charles Brasch (1909–1973) at Waitaki (1923–1926), a poet and patron of artists; Douglas Lilburn (1915–2001), &quot;the elder statesman of New Zealand music&quot;; James Bertram (1910–1993), writer and academic; Denis Blundell, a future Governor-General of New Zealand; and Ian Milner (1911–1991), the Rector&#x27;s son, a Czech and English scholar falsely accused of spying for Communism. His father, known as &quot;The Man&quot;, died suddenly on 2 December 1944 while speaking at the opening of a stone gateway to Milner Park, Oamaru.

E.A. Gifford (1819–1894), an artist and Royal Academician, lived in Oamaru from 1877 to 1885 and from 1892 until his death. A genre, portrait and landscape painter he established a national reputation. His &quot;Auckland from the Wharf&quot; of 1887 is probably the best-known image of 19th-century Auckland.

Emily Gillies, a 19th-century Oamaru artist, was the daughter of C.H. Street, maternal niece of Edward Lear (1812–1888), the English watercolourist and writer of humorous verse. Lear&#x27;s sister had virtually brought her brother up. When he died childless before her she inherited his collection. The internationally-significant group of works came to North Otago, where it remained intact until the early 1970s.

The artist Colin McCahon (1919–1987) lived in Oamaru from 1930 to 1931, attending the Middle School. The place and the North Otago landscape made an impression on him. He revisited the area several times as an adult on painting trips. Cartoonist John Kent, who authored the &quot;Varoomshka&quot; comic strip for &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper in England, hailed from Oamaru.

A community of living artists , and many dealer galleries have premises in the historic precinct. One of the town&#x27;s principal living artists, Donna Demente, produces portraits and masks. At least partly through her work Oamaru hosts an annual mask festival each July, the &quot;Midwinter Masquerade&quot;. Another annual celebration, a Victorian Heritage fête, takes place in November.

Other noted former Oamaruvians include broadcaster Jim Mora and hockey player Scott Anderson. David Sewell played one test match for the New Zealand cricket team.

Video game designer Dean Hall grew up in Oamaru and attended Waitaki Boys&#x27; High School. His interest in mountaineering was fostered while on a geography field trip while studying there, ultimately culminating in him summiting Mount Everest in May 2013.

== Points of interest ==

Oamaru contains over 70 buildings registered as Category 1 or 2 Historic Places in the Heritage New Zealand register.

Many public buildings use as their construction material the local limestone (quarried especially near Weston) known as Oamaru stone. The Victorian precinct in the southern part of Oamaru&#x27;s main commercial district ranks as one of New Zealand&#x27;s most impressive streetscapes due to the many prominent 19th century buildings constructed from this material. Several key historic buildings in the area centred around Harbour Street and the lower Thames Street, Itchen Street, and Tyne Street area have been preserved by the Oamaru Whitestone Civic Trust as part of a historic precinct. The great palladian St Patrick&#x27;s Basilica is also a fine example in white Oamaru stone.

The Victorian theme has been embraced by local shops and galleries in this part of Oamaru in terms of shop fittings and décor. Further enhancing the &quot;olden days&quot; feel of the precinct are several arts and crafts shops, a transportation museum, an antique furniture shop, and traditional businesses such as book shops, antique clothing shops, and a book binder. Many of the buildings in this area close to the harbour used to serve as commercial warehouses and stores and now provide large spaces for galleries such as the Forrester Gallery, the Grainstore Gallery, The Libratory, and Steampunk HQ. Even the playgrounds in the harbour area continue the Victorian/industrial steam theme with a giant penny-farthing structure supporting the swings, and several steampunk-styled playground features.
In August 2016 Oamaru made it into the Guinness Book of World Records for the largest gathering of steampunks in the world: a term that was coined in the 1980s and is based on imagining inventions the Victorians might have created for the modern world.

The main retail, services and commercial areas line Thames Street, Severn Street and State Highway 1 running through the town, whereas the historic grand commercial buildings dominate the area around lower Thames, Tees, and Tyne Streets.

A colony of little blue penguins lives in a disused quarry on the harbour not far from the historic precinct. The penguins established themselves in the early 1990s, once the rock quarry had been closed in the 1970s, and in 1992 a group of volunteers started to help make the area suitable as a breeding habitat for the penguins and provide guided tours. Apart from the success of the penguin colony, their efforts were rewarded with the colony receiving the Otago Regional Council&#x27;s Environmental Award in 1995. During the early 2000s, a visitors&#x27; centre and two grandstands were completed, and today the Oamaru Blue Penguin Colony is Oamaru&#x27;s largest tourist attraction, receiving over 75,000 visitors annually. It is owned by the Waitaki District Council and carefully managed by the Waitaki Development Board, including monitoring and comparing of behaviour and numbers with a similar penguin colony nearby which is not open to visitors.

A steam train operated by the Oamaru Steam and Rail Restoration Society runs between a small railway station in the historic precinct and a terminus at the harbour close to the little blue penguin colony on Sundays and during school holidays.

Further south just outside the town, a colony of yellow-eyed penguins at Bushy Beach also attracts ecotourists. Penguins sometimes live under buildings close to the beach, including the town&#x27;s music club, &quot;The Penguin Club&quot;.

The North Otago Tree Planting Association, inaugurated by local Oamaru G.P. Dr. Eric Strawson Stubbs and North Otago farmer Mr. Syd Hurst in 1937, was a forerunner of the New Zealand Farm Forestry Association.

The historic Totara Estate is located 8 km south of Oamaru. Heritage New Zealand restored and opened these buildings to the public on 15 February 1982, exactly 100 years after the &quot;Dunedin&quot;&#x27;s historic sailing, which began the New Zealand frozen meat industry. By 1902 frozen meat made up 20% of all New Zealand exports.

Tourism Waitaki is the official tourism body for the whole of Waitaki District.

== Media ==
The &quot;Oamaru Mail&quot; is a weekly newspaper published every Friday by Allied Press Ltd. It has a team of reporters, who also write for the &quot;Otago Daily Times&quot;, based in Oamaru. It has served the people of the Waitaki region since 1876. &quot;The Oamaru Telegram&quot; is published every Tuesday and is produced, printed and published in Oamaru.

The town is within the coverage area of Radio Dunedin and within the circulation area of the &quot;Otago Daily Times&quot;, based in Dunedin. Oamaru has its own community television station, &quot;45 South Television&quot;, which transmits from Cape Wanbrow on UHF Digital channel 34, and an independent classic rock radio station &quot;Real Classic Rock&quot;, which has studios based in Thames Street, and transmits from Cape Wanbrow. Oamaru also has a radio station called Oamaru FM 91.2 that also broadcasts from Cape Wanbrow.

From 1980 onwards, Oamaru was served by local Radio New Zealand station Radio Waitaki, until it was rebranded as The Hits in 2014. Port FM in Timaru also formerly broadcast local station Whitestone FM, before it reverted to the Port FM network, later becoming a More FM station.

Oamaru is on State Highway 1 (SH1), the main road route down the eastern coast of the South Island. There are regular coach and minibus services to Christchurch, Dunedin, and the Mackenzie Country, leaving from Eden Street outside the Lagonda Tearooms, which provides booking facilities and other travel services.

Oamaru is the end point of the Alps to Ocean Cycle Trail from Aoraki / Mount Cook, a cycle trail constructed following approval in 2010 by the New Zealand Cycle Trail project. The trail terminates at Friendly Bay, adjacent to Oamaru&#x27;s Victorian Historic Precinct.

Oamaru Airport is north of the town at Pukeuri. After Air New Zealand Link ceased operations in 2010, scheduled flights between Oamaru and Christchurch resumed in 2014 with Mainland Air. However they were terminated after a few months.

The main south line of the South Island Main Trunk Railway leads through Oamaru. A short side track connects Oamaru&#x27;s historic precinct and a disused quarry at the harbour, with a tourist steam train running on Sundays. The 1900 railway station has been listed NZHPT Category II since 1983. It is a standard class B station, of weatherboard and corrugated iron.

== Cultural references ==
Janet Frame fictionalised the Oamaru of her childhood as &quot;Waimaru&quot;, her &#x27;kingdom by the sea&#x27;. Some of Fiona Farrell&#x27;s literary works also feature Oamaru. Peter F. Hamilton&#x27;s novel &quot;The Dreaming Void&quot; (London: Macmillan, 2007; ) refers to &quot;the backwater External World of Oamaru&quot; (page 22). The same author&#x27;s science-fiction novel &quot;Great North Road&quot; mentions a remote camp called Oamaru, set up in the unexplored remote continent of Brogal on the Sirius-system planet St Libra in the year 2143.

Parts of Oamaru&#x27;s Victorian precinct were used for the set of the Netflix films &quot;The Royal Treatment&quot; and &quot;The Power of the Dog.&quot; and in January 2025, the Netflix TV series &quot;East of Eden&quot;.

<text>Brassica () is a genus of plants in the cabbage and mustard family (Brassicaceae). The members of the genus are informally known as cruciferous vegetables, cabbages, mustard plants, or simply brassicas. Crops from this genus are sometimes called &quot;cole crops&quot;derived from the Latin &quot;caulis&quot;, denoting the stem or stalk of a plant.

The genus &quot;Brassica&quot; is known for its important agricultural and horticultural crops and also includes a number of weeds, both of wild taxa and escapees from cultivation. &quot;Brassica&quot; species and varieties commonly used for food include bok choy, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, choy sum, kohlrabi, napa cabbage, rutabaga, turnip and some seeds used in the production of canola oil and the condiment mustard. Over 30 wild species and hybrids are in cultivation, plus numerous cultivars and hybrids of cultivated origin. Most are seasonal plants (annuals or biennials), but some are small shrubs. &quot;Brassica&quot; plants have been the subject of much scientific interest for their agricultural importance. Six particular species (&quot;B. carinata&quot;, &quot;B. juncea&quot;, &quot;B. oleracea&quot;, &quot;B. napus&quot;, &quot;B. nigra&quot;, and &quot;B. rapa&quot;) evolved by the combining of chromosomes from three earlier species, as described by the triangle of U theory.

The genus is native to Western Europe, the Mediterranean and temperate regions of Asia. Many wild species grow as weeds, especially in North America, South America, and Australia.

A dislike for cabbage or broccoli may result from the fact that these plants contain a compound similar to phenylthiocarbamide (PTC), which is either bitter or tasteless to people depending on their taste buds.

== Uses ==
=== Food ===
The flowers, seeds, stalks, and tender leaves of many species of &quot;Brassica&quot; can be eaten raw or cooked. Almost all parts of some species have been developed for food, including the root (swede, turnip), stems (kohlrabi), leaves (cabbage, collard greens, kale), flowers (cauliflower, broccoli, romanesco broccoli), buds (Brussels sprouts, cabbage), and seeds (many, including mustard seed, and oil-producing rapeseed). Some forms with white or purple foliage or flowerheads are also sometimes grown for ornament.

&quot;Brassica&quot; species are sometimes used as food plants by the larvae of a number of Lepidoptera species.

=== Cooking ===
Boiling substantially reduces the levels of broccoli glucosinolates, while other cooking methods, such as steaming, microwaving, and stir frying, have no significant effect on glucosinolate levels.

*&quot;B. alba&quot; or &quot;B. hirta&quot; (white or yellow mustard)—see &quot;Sinapis alba&quot;
*&quot;B. geniculata&quot; (hoary mustard)—see &quot;Hirschfeldia incana&quot;
*&quot;B. kaber&quot; (wild mustard or charlock)—see &quot;Rhamphospermum arvense&quot;
*&quot;B. nigra&quot; —see &quot;Rhamphospermum nigrum&quot;

== Genome sequencing and genetics ==
Bayer CropScience (in collaboration with BGI-Shenzhen, China; KeyGene; the Netherlands and the University of Queensland, Australia) announced it had sequenced the entire genome of rapeseed (canola, &quot;Brassica napus&quot;) and its constituent genomes present in &quot;B. rapa&quot; and &quot;B. oleracea&quot; in 2009. The &quot;B. rapa&quot; genome was sequenced by the Multinational Brassica Genome Project in 2011. This also represents the A genome component of the amphidiploid crop species &quot;B. napus&quot; and &quot;B. juncea&quot;.

== Etymology ==
&#x27;Brassica&#x27; was Pliny the Elder&#x27;s name for several cabbage-like plants.

<doc id="106357" wikidata="Q400985" url="?curid=106357" title="Missing (1982 film)">
<text>Missing (stylized as missing.) is a 1982 American biographical thriller drama film directed by Costa-Gavras from a screenplay written by Gavras and Donald E. Stewart, adapted from the book &quot;The Execution of Charles Horman: An American Sacrifice&quot; (1978) by Thomas Hauser (later republished under the title &quot;Missing&quot; in 1982), based on the disappearance of American journalist Charles Horman, in the aftermath of the United States-backed Chilean coup of 1973, which deposed the democratically elected socialist President Salvador Allende.

The film stars Jack Lemmon, Sissy Spacek, Melanie Mayron, John Shea, Janice Rule and Charles Cioffi. Set largely during the days and weeks following Horman&#x27;s disappearance, it examines the relationship between Horman&#x27;s wife Beth and his father Edmund and their subsequent quest to find Horman.

&quot;Missing&quot; was theatrically released on February 12, 1982 to critical acclaim. The film premiered at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival where it was jointly awarded the Palme d&#x27;Or (along with the Turkish film &quot;Yol&quot;), while Lemmon won the Best Actor prize. It received four nominations at the 55th Academy Awards; Best Picture, Best Actor (for Lemmon), Best Actress (for Spacek) and won Best Adapted Screenplay. The film created significant controversy in Chile and was banned during Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s dictatorship; neither Chile nor Pinochet is mentioned by name, although the Chilean cities of Viña del Mar and Santiago are.

==Plot==
Ed Horman, a conservative businessman from New York, arrives in Chile to search for his son Charlie, a journalist who disappeared during the recent military coup. Ed meets his daughter-in-law, Beth, with whom he has a strained relationship, and they argue over politics. Ed blames his son and daughter-in-law&#x27;s radical political views for Charlie&#x27;s disappearance, while Beth blames the American government. Ed leverages his connections to meet with various government officials to uncover the truth about his son&#x27;s vanishing.

As he investigates, Ed discovers that the American embassy is not as helpful as he expected and suspects them of concealing information about Charlie. One U.S. diplomat is polite and friendly but consistently lies to him; a high-ranking American military attaché is blunt and tells Ed that whatever happened to Charlie was his own fault, stating, &quot;You play with fire, you get burned.&quot; Together, he and Beth learn that the U.S. had many interests in the country that were enhanced by the coup and its aftermath, and that many military officials aided Pinochet in the coup. As Ed becomes disillusioned with the American government, he comes to respect the work Beth and Charlie were doing, and he and Beth reconcile. When they receive proof that Charlie was murdered by the junta and that the U.S. allowed it to happen, he tells the embassy officials, &quot;I just thank God we live in a country where we can still put people like you in jail!&quot;

The film concludes with a postscript stating that, after Ed&#x27;s return to the United States, he received Charlie&#x27;s body seven months later, making an autopsy impossible, and that a subsequent lawsuit against the U.S. government was dismissed. It also adds that the State Department denies its involvement in the Pinochet coup, a position maintained to the present day.

==Cast==
==Production==
The film was shot in Mexico with a budget of $9.5 million from Universal Studios, marking Costa-Gavras&#x27; most expensive production.

==Soundtrack==
The score is by the Greek electronic composer Vangelis. The movie&#x27;s piano theme has been used extensively in commercials, but an official release of the film&#x27;s soundtrack has not yet occurred. The main theme appeared first on Vangelis&#x27; 1989 album &quot;Themes&quot;. A 45rpm single of the title track backed with &quot;Eric&#x27;s Theme&quot; from &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; was released by Polydor in 1989. The main theme is also available on the Festival de Cannes (60th Anniversary) compilation of famous soundtracks. A bootleg release of the soundtrack exists. A sung version with lyrics by Tim Rice has been recorded by Elaine Paige and Nana Mouskouri.

==Release==
&quot;Missing&quot; was released in theaters on February 12, 1982, in limited theaters and was released widely on March 12, 1982, in 733 theaters. It ranked at #3 at the box office, grossing $2.3 million. In its first week, it grossed $5.5 million. In its second weekend, it landed at #5, making $1.8 million. For its second week, it made $2.3 million. After 49 days and 7 weeks in theaters, the film made between $14 and $16 million in the US.
The film was released on both VHS and Laserdisc, in 1982 and 1987, by MCA Videocassette, MCA Videodisc, and MCA Home Video respectively. The VHS version was pulled from the market due to the lawsuit filed against director Costa-Gavras. Universal Home Video re-released &quot;Missing&quot; on DVD in 2004, following the dismissal of the lawsuit. A special edition DVD was released by The Criterion Collection in October 2008.

==Lawsuit==
In 1983, a year after the film&#x27;s theatrical release, both the film (then in the home video market) and Thomas Hauser&#x27;s book &quot;The Execution of Charles Horman&quot; were removed from the United States market following a lawsuit filed against Costa-Gavras and Universal Pictures&#x27;s (then) parent company MCA by former ambassador Nathaniel Davis and two others for libel. A lawsuit against Hauser himself was dismissed because the statute of limitations had expired. Davis and his associates lost their lawsuit, after which the film was re-released by Universal in 2006.

==Reception==
===Reviews===
Roger Ebert gave the film three stars, writing that while the film was being cited for courage in criticism of the U.S. government, the criticism was clouded by its direction, but the best scenes were where Lemmon and Spacek&#x27;s character were bogged down by the embassy&#x27;s &quot;niceties&quot; in their search:By the time &quot;Missing&quot; begins its crucial last half-hour, a strange thing has happened. We care about this dead American, and his wife and father, almost despite the movie. The performances of Spacek and Lemmon carry us along through the movie&#x27;s undisciplined stylistic displays.
Vincent Canby, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, positively reviewed the film&#x27;s message and Ricardo Aronovich&#x27;s cinematography.

The American filmmaker Wes Anderson listed &quot;Missing&quot; as one of his favorite films.

In his &quot;2015 Movie Guide&quot;, Leonard Maltin awarded &quot;Missing&quot; three and a half stars, highlighting Lemmon&#x27;s acting and crediting Costa-Gavras as a skilled director. The film has a 94% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 32 reviews with the consensus: &quot;Thanks in large part to strong performances from Sissy Spacek and Jack Lemmon, &quot;Missing&quot; is both a gripping character exploration and an effective political thriller.&quot;

===Accolades===
&quot;Missing&quot; won the Palme d&#x27;Or (Golden Palm) at the 1982 Cannes Film Festival, while Lemmon was awarded Best Actor for his performance.

<doc id="106358" wikidata="Q212015" url="?curid=106358" title="Johnny Hallyday">
<text>Jean-Philippe Léo Smet (; 15 June 1943 – 5 December 2017), better known by his stage name Johnny Hallyday, was a French rock and roll and pop singer and actor, credited with having brought rock and roll to France.

During a career spanning 57 years, he released 79 albums and sold more than 110 million records worldwide, mainly in the French-speaking world, making him one of the best-selling artists in the world. He had five diamond albums, 40 gold albums, 22 platinum albums and earned ten &quot;Victoires de la Musique&quot;. He sang an estimated 1,154 songs and performed 540 duets with 187 artists. Credited for his strong voice and his spectacular shows, he sometimes arrived by entering a stadium through the crowd and once by jumping from a helicopter above the Stade de France, where he performed 9 times. Among his 3,257 shows completed in 187 tours, the most memorable were at Parc des Princes in 1993, at the Stade de France in 1998, just after France&#x27;s win in the 1998 FIFA World Cup, as well as at the Eiffel Tower in 2000, which had record-breaking ticket sales for a French artist. A million spectators gathered to see his performance at the Eiffel Tower, with some 10 million watching on television.

Usually working with the best French artists and musicians of his time, he collaborated with Charles Aznavour, Michel Berger and Jean-Jacques Goldman. Hugely popular in France, he was referred to as simply &quot;Johnny&quot; and seen as a &quot;national monument&quot; and a part of the French cultural legacy. He was a symbol of the Trente Glorieuses when he emerged in 1960 and a familiar figure to four generations. More than 2,500 magazine covers and 190 books were dedicated to him during his lifetime, making him one of the people most widely covered by the media in France. His death from cancer in 2017 was followed by a &quot;popular tribute&quot; during which a million people attended the procession and 15 million others watched the ceremony on TV. He remained relatively unknown in the English-speaking world, where he was dubbed &quot;the biggest rock star you&#x27;ve never heard of&quot; and introduced as the French version of Elvis Presley.

==Early life==
Jean-Philippe Smet was born in the 9th arrondissement of Paris on 15 June 1943 to a Belgian father, Léon Smet, and a French mother, Huguette Eugénie Pierrette Clerc. Léon Smet, who worked as a nightclub performer, left his wife and son a few months later. Clerc started a modeling career, which left her with little time to care for her son. Hallyday grew up with his aunt, Hélène Mar, and took his stage name from a cousin-in-law from Oklahoma (Lemoine Ketcham) who performed as Lee Halliday. The latter called Smet &quot;Johnny&quot; and became a father figure, introducing him to American music.

==Career==

Influenced by Elvis Presley and the 1950s rock n&#x27; roll revolution, Hallyday became known for singing rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll in French. His debut single, &quot;T&#x27;aimer follement&quot; (&quot;Love you madly&quot;), a French adaption of the controversial 1959 Floyd Robinson hit &quot;Makin&#x27; Love&quot; that was also a hit for Dalida the month prior, was released on the Vogue label in March 1960. His debut album, &quot;Hello Johnny&quot;, was released later that year. In 1961, his French-language cover of &quot;Let&#x27;s Twist Again&quot;, &quot;Viens Danser Le Twist&quot;, sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc. It topped almost every European chart, although the track did not appear in the UK Singles Chart. He appeared on the American &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; with American singing star Connie Francis in a show that was taped at the Moulin Rouge nightclub in Paris. He staged many appearances in the Paris Olympia under the management of Bruno Coquatrix. For their first concert, The Jimi Hendrix Experience opened for Johnny Hallyday in Nancy on 14 October 1966. Film footage from October 1966 exists of Hallyday partying with Hendrix, his manager Chas Chandler and others. He also socialised with Keith Richards and Bob Dylan.

At the end of the 1960s, Hallyday made a string of albums with Foreigner&#x27;s Mick Jones and Tommy Brown as musical directors, and Big Jim Sullivan, Bobby Graham and Jimmy Page as session musicians. These are &quot;Jeune homme&quot;, &quot;Rivière... Ouvre ton lit&quot; (also known as &quot;Je suis né dans la rue&quot;) and &quot;Vie&quot;. On &quot;Je suis né dans la rue&quot;, Hallyday hired both Peter Frampton and the Small Faces and they all play on most of the tracks on the album. Steve Marriott and Ronnie Lane of the Small Faces contributed their compositions &quot;Amen (Bang Bang)&quot;, &quot;Reclamation (News Report)&quot;, and &quot;Regarde pour moi (What You Will)&quot; to the album. &quot;Amen&quot; is a French-language variation on &quot;That Man&quot;, a previously-released 1967 Small Faces song played in a heavy rock style. Tensions between the Small Faces during the recording sessions led to Marriott leaving the band and forming Humble Pie with Frampton, and rearranged English language versions of both &quot;Reclamation (News Report)&quot; and &quot;Regarde pour moi (What You Will)&quot; appeared on Humble Pie&#x27;s debut LP of 1969. Often forgotten is Hallyday&#x27;s non-LP single and EP track &quot;Que je t&#x27;aime&quot; from the same sessions. By 1969 alone, his record sales exceeded twelve million units.

One of Hallyday&#x27;s later concerts, &quot;100% Johnny: Live à la tour Eiffel&quot; in 2000, attracted an audience of 500,000 and 9.5 million television viewers (the show was broadcast live on French TV). In December 2005, Hallyday had his third number-one single on the French SNEP singles chart since its establishment in 1984, &quot;Mon plus beau Noël&quot; (after &quot;Tous ensemble&quot; and &quot;Marie&quot;), dedicated to his adopted daughter Jade. Shortly before announcing his retirement from touring in 2007, he released a blues-flavored album, &quot;Le Cœur d&#x27;un homme&quot;. In addition to the lead single &quot;Always&quot;, &quot;Le Cœur d&#x27;un homme&quot; features &quot;T&#x27;aimer si mal&quot;, a duet with blues musician Taj Mahal and &quot;I Am the Blues&quot;, an English-language song (uncharacteristically for Hallyday) written by U2&#x27;s lead singer Bono. His next album, &quot;Ça ne finira jamais&quot;, released in 2008, another No. 1 on the French album chart, and its lead single, &quot;Ça n&#x27;finira jamais&quot;, also reached No. 1. Hallyday&#x27;s album &quot;Tour 66: Stade de France 2009&quot; was a live set recorded at Stade de France during his farewell tour. In 2011 Hallyday released album &quot;Jamais seul&quot;, recorded with Matthieu Chedid, and started touring again. In 2012 he gave concerts in different countries, including Russia, and released the album &quot;L&#x27;Attente&quot;. Later Hallyday released two live albums, &quot;On Stage&quot; and &quot;Born Rocker Tour&quot; (a recording of his 70th anniversary concerts in Bercy and Theatre de Paris). Albums named &quot;Rester Vivant&quot; and &quot;De L&#x27;Amour&quot; were released in 2014 and 2015 respectively. In 2015–2016 Hallyday had the &quot;Rester Vivant&quot; Tour. A concert in Brussels was released as a live album in 2016.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and children===
Hallyday was married five times, including twice to the same woman, with the first four marriages ending in divorce. His last marriage was his longest, lasting twenty-one years.

His first marriage was to French singer Sylvie Vartan, lasting fifteen years from 1965 to 1980. Their son David was born in 1966. His second marriage to Babeth Étienne was his shortest, lasting for 65 days. Hallyday had a four-year relationship with French actress Nathalie Baye. Their daughter Laura was born in 1983. His third and fourth marriages were to the same woman, Adeline Blondieau, from 1990 to 1992, and from 1994 to 1995. Officiated by Nicolas Sarkozy, his fifth and final marriage was to Læticia Boudou from 1996 until his death. The couple adopted two girls from Vietnam: Jade Odette Désirée, born 3 August 2004 (formerly Bùi Thị Hoà), in November 2004, and Joy in 2008.

===Residence===
Hallyday, who resided in Los Angeles, owned a chalet in the Swiss town of Gstaad from 2006 to 2015 to avoid the high tax rate imposed by the French government. Hallyday said that he would have moved his residency back to France if it changed its tax laws. In January 2014, Hallyday said that his current residence was in the United States after an investigation by a Swiss journalist showed that Hallyday did not spend enough time in Gstaad to qualify as a resident. One of his favourite leisure activities was riding his Harley-Davidson on long trips through the California desert, staying in small motels along the way.

===Illness and death===
In July 2009, Hallyday was diagnosed with colon cancer, and underwent surgery. On 26 November 2009, Hallyday underwent surgery in Paris to repair a herniated disc. He suffered complications and was admitted to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Doctors announced that they had put Hallyday into a medically-induced coma so they could repair lesions that had formed as a result of the surgery, and to relieve his pain. On 17 December 2009, Hallyday and his wife started legal proceedings against Stephane Delajoux, the doctor who had performed the original surgery. The conflict was resolved in February 2012 following Delajoux&#x27;s vindication by medical investigators.

Hallyday died of lung cancer at 10:10 pm on 5 December 2017 in Marnes-la-Coquette, near Paris, at the age of 74. French President Emmanuel Macron paid tribute, saying he &quot;transcended generations and is etched in the memory of the French people&quot;. On 9 December, his funeral was held in Paris; 900,000 lined the Champs-Élysées as his body was taken to the Madeleine Church. The service was attended by Macron and two of his predecessors. 

He was buried on the French Caribbean island of Saint Barthélemy in the cemetery of Lorient parish church (&quot;Église de Lorient&quot;) on 11 December 2017.

In February 2018, his two oldest children, David and Laura, announced that they were contesting his will, which left his entire estate to his last wife Læticia and their two adopted children. The will was drafted in the US, and their lawyers contended that this violated French law, which prevents children from being disinherited.

==Legacy==

Hallyday was once called &quot;the French Elvis&quot;. &quot;The Daily Beast&quot; described Hallyday as &quot;a hip swiveling, leather-clad Gallic answer to Elvis Presley who shook up his home country&#x27;s music scene with American-style rock-n-roll and bad-boy antics.&quot; He remained largely unknown outside the francophone world and was sometimes described as &quot;the biggest rock star you&#x27;ve never heard of&quot; in English-speaking countries. He was made &quot;Chevalier&quot; (Knight) of the Legion of Honour in 1997 and Officer of the Order of the Crown (Belgium) in 2001.

Jimmy Buffett paid tribute to Johnny with his song &quot;Johnny&#x27;s Rhum&quot; on his 2023 album &quot;Equal Strain On All Parts&quot;.

<text>The Verdict is a 1982 American legal drama film directed by Sidney Lumet and written by David Mamet, adapted from Barry Reed&#x27;s 1980 novel of the same name. The film stars Paul Newman as a down-on-his-luck alcoholic lawyer who accepts a medical malpractice case to improve his own situation, but discovers along the way that he is doing the right thing. Charlotte Rampling, Jack Warden, James Mason, Milo O&#x27;Shea and Lindsay Crouse also star in supporting roles.

&quot;The Verdict&quot; garnered critical acclaim and box office success. It was nominated for five Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor in a Leading Role (Newman), Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Mason), and Best Adapted Screenplay.

==Plot==

Once-promising attorney Frank Galvin is an alcoholic ambulance chaser. As a favor, former partner Mickey Morrissey sends him a medical malpractice case which is all but certain to be settled for a significant amount. The case involves a young woman given general anesthesia during childbirth at a Catholic hospital, after which she choked on her vomit and was left comatose. The plaintiffs, her sister and brother-in-law, intend to use the settlement to pay for her care.

A representative of the Catholic diocese offers a $210,000 settlement (about $675,000 in 2024). Deeply affected by seeing the woman, Galvin declines and states his intention to try the case, stunning the opposing party and the judge. While preparing for the trial, Galvin encounters Laura Fischer in a bar and they become romantically involved.

Galvin experiences several setbacks. The hospital&#x27;s attorney, Ed Concannon, has a large legal team that is masterful with the press. The comatose woman&#x27;s brother-in-law angrily confronts Galvin after Concannon&#x27;s team tells him of the settlement offer that Galvin rejected. Galvin&#x27;s medical expert disappears before testifying and a hastily arranged substitute&#x27;s credentials are challenged. Nobody who was in the operating room is willing to testify that negligence occurred.

In chambers, Judge Hoyle threatens Galvin with disbarment, but Galvin angrily dismisses him as a bagman for the local political machine and &quot;defendant&#x27;s judge&quot; who is on the bench because he couldn&#x27;t &quot;hack it&quot; as a lawyer. Hoyle denies Galvin&#x27;s motion for a mistrial and threatens to have him arrested. Galvin storms out.

Galvin notices the admitting nurse, Kaitlin Costello, filled out a form that included the question, &quot;When did you last eat?&quot; Galvin and Morrissey discover she is now a pre-school teacher in New York City and Galvin travels there to seek her help. As Laura hastily arranges to meet him, Morrissey discovers a check in her handbag and realizes Concannon is paying her for inside information. Morrissey informs Galvin of Laura&#x27;s betrayal, Galvin confronts her in a bar and strikes her, knocking her to the floor. On the flight back to Boston, Morrissey suggests moving for a mistrial due to Concannon&#x27;s ethics violation, but Galvin decides to continue.

In the courtroom, Costello testifies she wrote that the patient ate a full meal one hour before being admitted, contradicting the patient record, which states a nine-hour interval. On cross-examination, an incredulous Concannon asks how she can prove this. Costello reveals that her superiors threatened her with termination unless she changed the original record from &quot;1&quot; to &quot;9,&quot; but before doing so, she made a photocopy, which she brought to court. Concannon objects that for legal purposes, the original is presumed to be correct, but Hoyle unexpectedly reserves judgment. Costello testifies that the anesthesiologist later confessed that he had failed to read her admitting notes and administered general anesthesia, which is incorrect for someone who ate only one hour prior. As a result, the patient vomited and choked. When the anesthesiologist realized his error, he threatened to end Costello&#x27;s career if she did not change the admitting form.

After Costello is dismissed, Concannon again objects on the grounds that the hospital&#x27;s original admitting record has precedence. Hoyle agrees and declares Costello&#x27;s testimony stricken from the record. Afterward, a diocese lawyer praises Concannon&#x27;s performance to the bishop, who asks, &quot;But do you believe her?&quot; and is met with embarrassed silence.

Despite believing his case is hopeless, Galvin gives a brief but passionate closing argument. The jury finds in favor of the plaintiffs, and the foreman asks whether the jury can award more than what was asked for. Hoyle resignedly replies they can. As Galvin is congratulated outside the courtroom, he catches a glimpse of Laura watching him from across the atrium.

That night, a drunk Laura drops her whiskey on the floor, drags her telephone towards her, and dials Galvin&#x27;s office number. Galvin is sitting with a cup of coffee. He moves to answer the call but changes his mind and lets the phone continue to ring.

==Production==
Film rights to Reed’s novel were bought by the team of Richard Zanuck and David Brown. A number of actors, including Roy Scheider, William Holden, Frank Sinatra, Cary Grant and Dustin Hoffman, expressed interest in the project because of the strength of the lead role. Arthur Hiller was originally attached to direct while David Mamet was hired to write a screenplay. Though Mamet had made a name for himself in the theater, he was still new to screenwriting (his first film credit had come in 1978). The producers were uncertain whether Mamet would take the job given the standards he set with his own previous work, but according to Lindsay Crouse, who was then married to Mamet, the film was actually a big deal for him. Crouse also recalled Mamet struggling initially with Galvin&#x27;s closing summation, but he finally came up with the scene after staying up an entire night working on it.

Mamet&#x27;s original draft ended the film after the jury left the courtroom for deliberations, giving no resolution to the case. Neither Zanuck nor Brown believed they could make the film without showing what happened, and Zanuck met with Mamet to convince him to re-write the ending. However, Mamet told Zanuck that the ending he wanted was &quot;old-fashioned&quot; and would hurt the film. He also reacted negatively to Zanuck&#x27;s use of sarcasm to make his point, as Zanuck claimed his copy of the script was missing its final pages before telling Mamet the film title would need a question mark after it. Hiller also disliked Mamet&#x27;s script, and left the project. The producers commissioned another screenplay from Jay Presson Allen, which they preferred, and they were later approached by Robert Redford to star in the film when he obtained a copy of the script from Allen. Redford suggested James Bridges as a writer-director, and he had Bridges write several drafts of the screenplay, more or less sanitizing the lead character as he was concerned about playing a hard-drinking womanizer. Neither the producers nor Redford were happy with the rewrites and soon Bridges left the project. Redford then began having meetings with Sydney Pollack without telling the producers; irritated, they fired Redford.

Zanuck and Brown then hired Sidney Lumet to direct, sending him all versions of the script. After several rewrites, Lumet decided the story&#x27;s original grittiness was fast devolving and chose Mamet&#x27;s original script. This was agreed to by Paul Newman, who ultimately agreed to star. Lumet recalled that they had to rework only one or two scenes, mainly giving the trial a resolution as Zanuck and Brown had originally requested. Unlike Zanuck, when Lumet approached Mamet, he was able to get his approval to make that change to his original work. Lumet then recruited Warden and Mason, both of whom he had worked with before. He wasn&#x27;t sure if Mason, a renowned actor in that era, would take a supporting role, but Mason liked Mamet&#x27;s script and did not object.

Prior to filming, Lumet held extensive dress rehearsals, standard practice for Lumet&#x27;s films but not common on Hollywood productions. Newman was appreciative as they proved crucial in developing his performance, giving him the time he needed to tap into the emotional bankruptcy of his character. At one point during production, Newman barely avoided serious injury when a light estimated to weigh several hundred pounds fell about three feet away from him after breaking through its supports. The wood planks were apparently weakened by overnight rain.

The producers were reluctant to keep the scene where Newman strikes Rampling, believing it would turn the audience against his character and even damage his public image. Newman insisted on keeping it, believing it was right for the story. After the film was finished, the studio&#x27;s executives sent Lumet several suggestions and urged him to rework the ending with Galvin finally answering Laura&#x27;s phone call, but Zanuck said that Lumet had final cut authority, and the film would remain as completed.

The courtroom scenes in &quot;The Verdict&quot; were also notable for the appearance of Tobin Bell and Bruce Willis as observers. Both were uncredited extras.

==Reception==
Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 88%, with an average rating of 7.8/10, based on 40 reviews. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;Paul Newman is at the peak of his powers as an attorney who never lived up to his potential in &quot;The Verdict&quot;, supported by David Mamet&#x27;s crackling script and Sidney Lumet&#x27;s confident direction.&quot; 

In a poll of 500 films held by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, it was voted 254th Greatest Movie of all time. In 2013, the Writers Guild of America ranked the screenplay #91 on its list of the &quot;101 greatest screenplays ever written&quot;. Richard D. Pepperman praised the scene in which Judge Hoyle eats breakfast and offers Galvin coffee as &quot;a terrific use of objects, making for a believable judge in his personal, comfortable and suitable place, as well as a Physical Action (motion) that demonstrates the subtext of the Judge&#x27;s objective (in support of the insurance company, the doctor and their attorney) without an abundance of expository dialogue.&quot;

The film opened in 3 theaters in New York City and grossed $143,265 in its first 5 days. The following weekend it expanded to 615 screens and grossed $2,331,805, finishing seventh for the weekend, and went on to gross $54 million.

==Awards and nominations==
The film is recognized by the American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2006: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Cheers – #75
* 2008: AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10: #4 Courtroom Drama Film

<text>Irving Rapper (16 January 1898 – 20 December 1999) was a British-born American film director.

==Biography==
Born to a Jewish family in London, Rapper emigrated to the United States and became an actor and a stage director on Broadway while studying at New York University. In 1936, he went to Hollywood, where he was hired by Warner Bros. as an assistant director and dialogue coach. He proved invaluable in translating and mediating for non-native English-speaking directors. He made his directing debut with the 1941 film &quot;Shining Victory&quot;, in which his friend Bette Davis appeared as a show of support for him. He would go on to direct her in four more films, &quot;Now, Voyager&quot; (1942) - selected, in 2007, for preservation in the United States National Film Registry, &quot;The Corn Is Green&quot; (1945), &quot;Deception&quot; (1946), and &quot;Another Man&#x27;s Poison&quot; (1952).

Rapper&#x27;s film &quot;One Foot in Heaven&quot; (1941) was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. Perhaps his best film in a studio other than Warner Bros. was &quot;The Brave One&quot; (1956) about a Mexican boy who must rescue his bull from a brutal fight against a top matador, which earned the then-blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo an Oscar for his original screenplay, despite being a box office failure.
Additional credits include &quot;The Voice of the Turtle&quot; (1947), &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; (1950), &quot;Marjorie Morningstar&quot; (1958), and &quot;The Miracle&quot;, a 1959 remake of the 1912 hand-colored, black-and-white film &quot;The Miracle&quot;.

Biopics directed by Rapper include: &quot;The Adventures of Mark Twain&quot; (1944), &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; (1945), &quot;Pontius Pilate&quot; (co-director, 1962), &quot;The Christine Jorgensen Story&quot; (1970), and his last film, &quot;Born Again&quot; (1978), about convicted Watergate conspirator and former Richard Nixon aide Charles Colson.

==Death==
Rapper died on 20 December 1999 at the age of 101 at the Motion Picture and Television Fund home in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles, he had been a resident at the home for four years.

<doc id="106362" wikidata="Q739780" url="?curid=106362" title="Oz (TV series)">
<text>Oz is an American prison drama television series set at a fictional men&#x27;s prison created and principally written by Tom Fontana. It was the first one-hour dramatic television series to be produced by the premium cable network HBO. &quot;Oz&quot; premiered on July 12, 1997, and ran for six seasons. The series finale aired on February 23, 2003.

==Overview==
&quot;Oz&quot; is the nickname for the Oswald State Correctional Facility, formerly Oswald State Penitentiary, a fictional level 4 maximum-security state prison in an unspecified east coast state, although references throughout the series point to New York as its location. The nickname &quot;Oz&quot; is also a reference to the classic film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939), which popularized the phrase, &quot;There&#x27;s no place like home.&quot; A poster for the series uses the tagline: &quot;It&#x27;s no place like home&quot;. Most of the series&#x27; story arcs are set in &quot;Emerald City&quot;, a wing named after a setting from the fictional Land of Oz in L. Frank Baum&#x27;s &quot;Oz&quot; books, first described in &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900).

==Plot==
In an experimental unit of the prison, unit manager Tim McManus emphasizes rehabilitation and learning responsibility during incarceration, rather than carrying out purely punitive measures. Emerald City is an extremely controlled environment, with a carefully managed balance of members from each racial and social group, intended to ease tensions among these various factions. However, almost all of these factions are constantly at war with one another which often results in many prisoners being beaten, raped, or murdered.

Under McManus and Warden Leo Glynn, all inmates in &quot;Em City&quot; struggle to fulfill their own needs. Some fight for power – either over the drug trade or over other inmate factions and individuals. Others, corrections officers and inmates alike, simply want to survive, some long enough to make parole and others just to see the next day. The show&#x27;s narrator, inmate Augustus Hill, explains the show, and provides context, thematic analysis, and a sense of humor.

&quot;Oz&quot; chronicles McManus&#x27; attempts to keep control over the inmates of Em City. There are many groups of inmates throughout the show, and not everyone within each group survives the show&#x27;s events. There are the African-American Homeboys (Wangler, Redding, Poet, Keane, Adebisi) and Muslims (Said, Arif, Khan), the Wiseguys (Pancamo, Nappa, Schibetta, Zanghi, Urbano), the Aryan Brotherhood (Schillinger, Robson, Mack), the Latinos of El Norte (Alvarez, Morales, Guerra, Hernandez), the Irish (The O&#x27;Reilly brothers, Kirk, Keenan), the Gays (Hanlon, Cramer, Ginzburg), the Bikers (Hoyt, Sands, Burns), the Christians (Cloutier, Coushaine, Cudney) and many other individuals not completely affiliated with one particular group (Rebadow, Busmalis, Keller, Stanislofsky). In contrast to the dangerous criminals, central character Tobias Beecher gives a look at a usually law-abiding albeit alcoholic man who made one fatal drunk-driving mistake.

;Cast notes
==Episodes==
&quot;Oz&quot; took advantage of the freedoms of premium cable to show elements of coarse language, drug use, violence, frontal nudity, homosexuality, and rape of males, as well as ethnic and religious conflicts that would have been unacceptable to traditional advertiser-supported American broadcast television.

On an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; that Jerry Seinfeld hosted on October 2, 1999, a sketch was produced that showed what life was like for his character of the same name behind bars after being transferred to the Oswald State Correctional Facility sometime after the events of &quot;Seinfeld&quot; (1989–1998).

==Reception==
===Critical reception===

Critical reception of &quot;Oz&quot; was mostly positive. The first season of &quot;Oz&quot; has been ranked a 70 based on the rating aggregator website Metacritic, indicating generally favorable reviews by critics. Caryn James from &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated: &quot;Set almost entirely in the prison, a high-tech horror with glass-walled cells, &quot;Oz&quot; can also be unpleasant to watch, it is so gruesome and claustrophobic. Yet... as the series moves beyond its introductory shock value, it becomes more serious, disturbing and gripping... The point of &quot;Oz&quot;, with its depiction of guilty men in torturous circumstances, is never subtle, but it is complicated and strong.&quot; Steve Johnson of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote: &quot;Engaging, often Brutal.&quot;

Other reviews were more critical of the series. Frederic Biddle of the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; said: &quot;A pretentious exercise in cheap thrills, by great talents allowed to run amok.&quot; Howard Rosenberg of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported: &quot;Its uniqueness and arresting style don&#x27;t earn it an unqualified endorsement here, for its first two Fontana-written episodes are absolute downers--there&#x27;s no light at the end of a tunnel, nor even a tunnel--that offer no central characters to like or pull for...Be forewarned, too, that Oz is flat-out the most violent and graphically sexual series on TV.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
&quot;Oz&quot; has had a successful run at many award associations, including, four wins out of sixteen nominations at the ALMA Awards, three wins out if six nominations at the Artios Awards, three wins out of seven nominations at the CableACE Awards, one win out of twenty-two nominations at the Online Film &amp; Television Association Awards, and two wins out of five nomination at the Satellite Awards.

<text>Nicolas Slonimsky ( – December 25, 1995), born Nikolai Leonidovich Slonimskiy (), was a Russian-born American musicologist, conductor, pianist, and composer. Best known for his writing and musical reference work, he wrote the &quot;Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns&quot; and the &quot;Lexicon of Musical Invective&quot;, and edited &quot;Baker&#x27;s Biographical Dictionary of Musicians&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life in Russia and Europe===
Slonimsky was born Nikolai Leonidovich Slonimskiy in Saint Petersburg. He was of Jewish origin; his grandfather was Rabbi Chaim Zelig Slonimsky. His parents adopted the Orthodox faith after the birth of his older brother, and Nicolas was baptized in the Russian Orthodox Church. His maternal aunt, Isabelle Vengerova, later a founder of Philadelphia&#x27;s Curtis Institute of Music, was his first piano teacher.

He grew up in the intelligentsia. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, he moved south, first to Kyiv, then to Constantinople, and ultimately to Paris, where many other Russian musicians and his sister Yulia Slonimskaya Sazonova had already fled. He worked as accompanist to conductor Serge Koussevitzky, and he toured Europe in 1921–22 as accompanist to tenor Vladimir Rosing. In 1923, Rosing became director of opera at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, and he invited Slonimsky to join him.

Slonimsky&#x27;s younger brother, Mikhail, remained in Russia and became an author. His nephew, Sergei Slonimsky, became a composer.

===Conducting career===

In Rochester, Slonimsky continued his composition and conducting studies, with Albert Coates and Eugene Goossens, and accompanied Rosing at many vocal recitals, including a performance at Carnegie Hall in October 1924. After two years, he moved to Boston, where Koussevitzky had become conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and resumed his position as his pianist and now bilingual secretary. During this time, Slonimsky taught music theory at the Boston Conservatory and the Malkin Conservatory, and began to write music articles for &quot;The Boston Evening Transcript&quot;, &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; and the magazine &quot;The Etude&quot;.

Slonimsky began writing songs and other incidental pieces, and performed as a piano soloist and vocal accompanist. In 1927, he formed the Boston Chamber Orchestra, for which he solicited music from contemporary composers. Slonimsky was a great champion of contemporary music, and through his interest in performing it met Henry Cowell and Charles Ives. He conducted the world premieres of Ives&#x27; &quot;Three Places in New England&quot; in 1931 (in New York&#x27;s Town Hall), Edgard Varèse&#x27;s &quot;Ionisation&quot; for thirteen percussionists in 1933, and various other works.

In 1931, Slonimsky married Dorothy Adlow, art critic of &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;. She was active as a critic and lectured extensively around the U.S., serving on panels and art juries. They married in Paris, with Varèse as best man. Their daughter, Electra, later edited his letters and collected works.

In 1932, Slonimsky conducted a series of concerts in Havana highlighting Ives, Ruggles, Cowell, Amadeo Roldán and Alejandro García Caturla. He then traveled to Paris, Berlin and Budapest to conduct further concerts. He mentioned at the time he found conducting to be &quot;the nearest approximation to music in motion&quot;. Thanks to the popularity of these tours, he was invited to conduct five concerts in the Hollywood Bowl in the summer of 1933. These were controversial and received mixed critical reviews.

=== Writings and musical criticism ===
Throughout his life, Slonimsky wrote extensively for periodicals and newspapers, produced program and liner notes, and contributed to numerous reference works. He described himself as a &quot;diaskeuast&quot; (from Greek διασκευαστής), a &quot;reviser or interpolator&quot;. When his conducting career slowed, he spent more time writing about music. He produced the chronology &quot;Music Since 1900&quot;, and later after travelling in Latin America, produced the first thorough coverage in English, &quot;Music of Latin America&quot;. In 1947 he published the &quot;Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns&quot;, which would later become one of his most influential works as a sourcebook for composers and performers. The book influenced many jazz musicians and composers, including Allan Holdsworth, John Coltrane, Frank Zappa, Paul Grabowsky, and Steve Rochinski, and remained in print 60 years later, but was largely ignored for years after its publication. Quincy Jones said in a February 2018 interview: &quot;Every time I used to see Coltrane he&#x27;d have Nicolas Slonimsky&#x27;s book.&quot;

Two books for children followed, &quot;The Road to Music&quot; and &quot;A Thing or Two About Music&quot;, with jokes, anecdotes and puzzles. Then in 1953, Slonimsky brought out the &quot;Lexicon of Musical Invective&quot; (&quot;Critical Assaults on Composers since Beethoven&#x27;s Time&quot;), a collection of hilariously scathing, insulting, vituperative, and enraged contemporary critiques of musical greats in their time. In 1958, he became editor of &quot;Baker&#x27;s Biographical Dictionary of Musicians&quot;, developing a reputation for factual accuracy, and remained its head editor until 1992.

=== Later life and work ===
In 1964 Slonimsky&#x27;s wife died and he moved to Los Angeles. He taught at UCLA for three years, and lectured and spoke about music, introducing himself to classes by spelling out his name: &quot;Slonimsky. S–L–O as in &#x27;slow&#x27;, N–I–M as in &#x27;nimble&#x27;, S–K–Y as in &#x27;sky&#x27;.&quot; He possessed a sly sense of humor, and was a regular guest on radio and television programs, including Johnny Carson&#x27;s &quot;Tonight Show&quot;. New York public television station WNET filmed an interview with him for the &quot;Aging&quot; segment of the PBS series &quot;The Mind&quot;.

He became a friend of avant-garde composer and rock guitarist Frank Zappa, and performed some of his own compositions at a Zappa concert in Santa Monica, California, in 1981. He named his cat Grody-to-the-Max after learning the phrase from Zappa&#x27;s daughter Moon Zappa.

Slonimsky wrote the &quot;Lectionary of Music&quot; as a &quot;reading dictionary,&quot; as he called it. Then in 1988, he published his autobiography, &quot;Perfect Pitch&quot;, filled with anecdotes about musical figures of the 20th century, including his mentors and colleagues.

For his 98th birthday, he visited Saint Petersburg to participate in a music festival. A documentary of his life including video of this visit, &quot;A Touch of Genius&quot;, was broadcast by Film America on his 100th birthday. He died in Los Angeles in 1995 at the age of 101. His papers are archived in the Library of Congress.

<text>In mathematics, an algebraic structure or algebraic system consists of a nonempty set &quot;A&quot; (called the underlying set, carrier set or domain), a collection of operations on &quot;A&quot; (typically binary operations such as addition and multiplication), and a finite set of identities (known as &quot;axioms&quot;) that these operations must satisfy.

An algebraic structure may be based on other algebraic structures with operations and axioms involving several structures. For instance, a vector space involves a second structure called a field, and an operation called &quot;scalar multiplication&quot; between elements of the field (called &quot;scalars&quot;), and elements of the vector space (called &quot;vectors&quot;).

Abstract algebra is the name that is commonly given to the study of algebraic structures. The general theory of algebraic structures has been formalized in universal algebra. Category theory is another formalization that includes also other mathematical structures and functions between structures of the same type (homomorphisms).

In universal algebra, an algebraic structure is called an &quot;algebra&quot;; this term may be ambiguous, since, in other contexts, an algebra is an algebraic structure that is a vector space over a field or a module over a commutative ring.

The collection of all structures of a given type (same operations and same laws) is called a variety in universal algebra; this term is also used with a completely different meaning in algebraic geometry, as an abbreviation of algebraic variety. In category theory, the collection of all structures of a given type and homomorphisms between them form a concrete category.

== Introduction ==

Addition and multiplication are prototypical examples of operations that combine two elements of a set to produce a third element of the same set. These operations obey several algebraic laws. For example, and are associative laws, and and are commutative laws. Many systems studied by mathematicians have operations that obey some, but not necessarily all, of the laws of ordinary arithmetic. For example, the possible moves of an object in three-dimensional space can be combined by performing a first move of the object, and then a second move from its new position. Such moves, formally called rigid motions, obey the associative law, but fail to satisfy the commutative law.

Sets with one or more operations that obey specific laws are called &quot;algebraic structures&quot;. When a new problem involves the same laws as such an algebraic structure, all the results that have been proved using only the laws of the structure can be directly applied to the new problem.

In full generality, algebraic structures may involve an arbitrary collection of operations, including operations that combine more than two elements (higher arity operations) and operations that take only one argument (unary operations) or even zero arguments (nullary operations). The examples listed below are by no means a complete list, but include the most common structures taught in undergraduate courses.

== Common axioms ==
===Equational axioms===
An axiom of an algebraic structure often has the form of an identity, that is, an equation such that the two sides of the equals sign are expressions that involve operations of the algebraic structure and variables. If the variables in the identity are replaced by arbitrary elements of the algebraic structure, the equality must remain true. Here are some common examples.
;Commutativity: An operation formula_1 is &quot;commutative&quot; if formula_2 for every and in the algebraic structure.
;Associativity: An operation formula_1 is &quot;associative&quot; if formula_4 for every , and in the algebraic structure.
;Left distributivity: An operation formula_1 is &quot;left distributive&quot; with respect to another operation formula_6 if formula_7 for every , and in the algebraic structure (the second operation is denoted here as formula_6, because the second operation is addition in many common examples).
;Right distributivity: An operation formula_1 is &quot;right distributive&quot; with respect to another operation formula_6 if formula_11 for every , and in the algebraic structure.
;Distributivity: An operation formula_1 is &quot;distributive&quot; with respect to another operation formula_6 if it is both left distributive and right distributive. If the operation formula_1 is commutative, left and right distributivity are both equivalent to distributivity.

===Existential axioms===
Some common axioms contain an existential clause. In general, such a clause can be avoided by introducing further operations, and replacing the existential clause by an identity involving the new operation. More precisely, let us consider an axiom of the form &quot;&quot;for all there is such that&quot; where is a -tuple of variables. Choosing a specific value of for each value of defines a function formula_15 which can be viewed as an operation of arity , and the axiom becomes the identity formula_16

The introduction of such auxiliary operation complicates slightly the statement of an axiom, but has some advantages. Given a specific algebraic structure, the proof that an existential axiom is satisfied consists generally of the definition of the auxiliary function, completed with straightforward verifications. Also, when computing in an algebraic structure, one generally uses explicitly the auxiliary operations. For example, in the case of numbers, the additive inverse is provided by the unary minus operation formula_17

Also, in universal algebra, a variety is a class of algebraic structures that share the same operations, and the same axioms, with the condition that all axioms are identities. What precedes shows that existential axioms of the above form are accepted in the definition of a variety.

Here are some of the most common existential axioms.

;Identity element
:A binary operation formula_1 has an identity element if there is an element such that formula_19 for all in the structure. Here, the auxiliary operation is the operation of arity zero that has as its result.
;Inverse element
:Given a binary operation formula_1 that has an identity element , an element is &quot;invertible&quot; if it has an inverse element, that is, if there exists an element formula_21 such that formula_22For example, a group is an algebraic structure with a binary operation that is associative, has an identity element, and for which all elements are invertible.

=== Non-equational axioms ===
The axioms of an algebraic structure can be any first-order formula, that is a formula involving logical connectives (such as &quot;and&quot;, &quot;or&quot; and &quot;not&quot;), and logical quantifiers (formula_23) that apply to elements (not to subsets) of the structure.

Such a typical axiom is inversion in fields. This axiom cannot be reduced to axioms of preceding types. (it follows that fields do not form a variety in the sense of universal algebra.) It can be stated: &quot;Every nonzero element of a field is invertible;&quot; or, equivalently: &quot;the structure has a unary operation such that
:formula_24
The operation can be viewed either as a partial operation that is not defined for ; or as an ordinary function whose value at 0 is arbitrary and must not be used.

== Common algebraic structures ==
=== One set with operations ===

Simple structures: no binary operation:

* Set: a degenerate algebraic structure &quot;S&quot; having no operations.

Group-like structures: one binary operation. The binary operation can be indicated by any symbol, or with no symbol (juxtaposition) as is done for ordinary multiplication of real numbers.

* Group: a monoid with a unary operation (inverse), giving rise to inverse elements.
* Abelian group: a group whose binary operation is commutative.

Ring-like structures or Ringoids: two binary operations, often called addition and multiplication, with multiplication distributing over addition.

* Ring: a semiring whose additive monoid is an abelian group.
* Division ring: a nontrivial ring in which division by nonzero elements is defined.
* Commutative ring: a ring in which the multiplication operation is commutative.
* Field: a commutative division ring (i.e. a commutative ring which contains a multiplicative inverse for every nonzero element).

Lattice structures: two or more binary operations, including operations called meet and join, connected by the absorption law.

* Complete lattice: a lattice in which arbitrary meet and joins exist.
* Bounded lattice: a lattice with a greatest element and least element.
* Distributive lattice: a lattice in which each of meet and join distributes over the other. A power set under union and intersection forms a distributive lattice.
* Boolean algebra: a complemented distributive lattice. Either of meet or join can be defined in terms of the other and complementation.

=== Two sets with operations ===

* Module: an abelian group &quot;M&quot; and a ring &quot;R&quot; acting as operators on &quot;M&quot;. The members of &quot;R&quot; are sometimes called scalars, and the binary operation of &quot;scalar multiplication&quot; is a function &quot;R&quot; × &quot;M&quot; → &quot;M&quot;, which satisfies several axioms. Counting the ring operations these systems have at least three operations.
* Vector space: a module where the ring &quot;R&quot; is a field or, in some contexts, a division ring.

* Algebra over a field: a module over a field, which also carries a multiplication operation that is compatible with the module structure. This includes distributivity over addition and linearity with respect to multiplication.
* Inner product space: a field &quot;F&quot; and vector space &quot;V&quot; with a definite bilinear form .

== Hybrid structures ==

Algebraic structures can also coexist with added structure of non-algebraic nature, such as partial order or a topology. The added structure must be compatible, in some sense, with the algebraic structure.

* Topological group: a group with a topology compatible with the group operation.
* Lie group: a topological group with a compatible smooth manifold structure.
* Ordered groups, ordered rings and ordered fields: each type of structure with a compatible partial order.
* Archimedean group: a linearly ordered group for which the Archimedean property holds.
* Topological vector space: a vector space whose &quot;M&quot; has a compatible topology.
* Normed vector space: a vector space with a compatible norm. If such a space is complete (as a metric space) then it is called a Banach space.
* Hilbert space: an inner product space over the real or complex numbers whose inner product gives rise to a Banach space structure.
* Vertex operator algebra
* Von Neumann algebra: a *-algebra of operators on a Hilbert space equipped with the weak operator topology.

== Universal algebra ==

Algebraic structures are defined through different configurations of axioms. Universal algebra abstractly studies such objects. One major dichotomy is between structures that are axiomatized entirely by &quot;identities&quot; and structures that are not. If all axioms defining a class of algebras are identities, then this class is a variety (not to be confused with algebraic varieties of algebraic geometry).

Identities are equations formulated using only the operations the structure allows, and variables that are tacitly universally quantified over the relevant universe. Identities contain no connectives, existentially quantified variables, or relations of any kind other than the allowed operations. The study of varieties is an important part of universal algebra. An algebraic structure in a variety may be understood as the quotient algebra of term algebra (also called &quot;absolutely free algebra&quot;) divided by the equivalence relations generated by a set of identities. So, a collection of functions with given signatures generate a free algebra, the term algebra &quot;T&quot;. Given a set of equational identities (the axioms), one may consider their symmetric, transitive closure &quot;E&quot;. The quotient algebra &quot;T&quot;/&quot;E&quot; is then the algebraic structure or variety. Thus, for example, groups have a signature containing two operators: the multiplication operator &quot;m&quot;, taking two arguments, and the inverse operator &quot;i&quot;, taking one argument, and the identity element &quot;e&quot;, a constant, which may be considered an operator that takes zero arguments. Given a (countable) set of variables &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;, etc. the term algebra is the collection of all possible terms involving &quot;m&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;e&quot; and the variables; so for example, &quot;m&quot;(&quot;i&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), &quot;m&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;m&quot;(&quot;y&quot;,&quot;e&quot;))) would be an element of the term algebra. One of the axioms defining a group is the identity &quot;m&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;i&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)) = &quot;e&quot;; another is &quot;m&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;e&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;. The axioms can be represented as trees. These equations induce equivalence classes on the free algebra; the quotient algebra then has the algebraic structure of a group.

Some structures do not form varieties, because either:

# It is necessary that 0 ≠ 1, 0 being the additive identity element and 1 being a multiplicative identity element, but this is a nonidentity;
# Structures such as fields have some axioms that hold only for nonzero members of &quot;S&quot;. For an algebraic structure to be a variety, its operations must be defined for &quot;all&quot; members of &quot;S&quot;; there can be no partial operations.

Structures whose axioms unavoidably include nonidentities are among the most important ones in mathematics, e.g., fields and division rings. Structures with nonidentities present challenges varieties do not. For example, the direct product of two fields is not a field, because formula_25, but fields do not have zero divisors.

== Category theory ==

Category theory is another tool for studying algebraic structures (see, for example, Mac Lane 1998). A category is a collection of &quot;objects&quot; with associated &quot;morphisms.&quot; Every algebraic structure has its own notion of homomorphism, namely any function compatible with the operation(s) defining the structure. In this way, every algebraic structure gives rise to a category. For example, the category of groups has all groups as objects and all group homomorphisms as morphisms. This concrete category may be seen as a category of sets with added category-theoretic structure. Likewise, the category of topological groups (whose morphisms are the continuous group homomorphisms) is a category of topological spaces with extra structure. A forgetful functor between categories of algebraic structures &quot;forgets&quot; a part of a structure.

There are various concepts in category theory that try to capture the algebraic character of a context, for instance

* algebraic category
* essentially algebraic category
* presentable category
* locally presentable category
* monadic functors and categories
* universal property.

== Different meanings of &quot;structure&quot; ==

In a slight abuse of notation, the word &quot;structure&quot; can also refer to just the operations on a structure, instead of the underlying set itself. For example, the sentence, &quot;We have defined a ring &quot;structure&quot; on the set formula_26&quot;, means that we have defined ring &quot;operations&quot; on the set formula_26. For another example, the group formula_28 can be seen as a set formula_29 that is equipped with an &quot;algebraic structure,&quot; namely the &quot;operation&quot; formula_6.

<text>James Hubert &quot;Eubie&quot; Blake (February 7, 1887 – February 12, 1983) was an American pianist and composer of ragtime, jazz, and popular music. In 1921, he and his long-time collaborator Noble Sissle wrote &quot;Shuffle Along&quot;, one of the first Broadway musicals written and directed by African Americans. Blake&#x27;s compositions included such hits as &quot;Bandana Days&quot;, &quot;Charleston Rag&quot;, &quot;Love Will Find a Way&quot;, &quot;Memories of You&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Just Wild About Harry&quot;. The 1978 Broadway musical &quot;Eubie!&quot; showcased his works, and in 1981, President Ronald Reagan awarded Blake the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

==Early years==
Blake was born at 319 Forrest Street in Baltimore, Maryland. Of the many children born to former slaves Emily &quot;Emma&quot; Johnstone and John Sumner Blake, he was the only one to survive childhood. John Sumner Blake was a stevedore on the Baltimore Docks.

Blake claimed in later life to have been born in 1883, but records published beginning in 2003—U.S. Census, military, and Social Security records and Blake&#x27;s passport application and passport—uniformly give his birth year as 1887.

==Music==

Blake&#x27;s musical training began when he was four or five. While out shopping with his mother, he wandered into a music store, climbed onto the bench of an organ, and started &quot;foolin’ around&quot;. When his mother found him, the store manager told her: &quot;The child is a genius! It would be criminal to deprive him of the chance to make use of such a sublime, God-given talent.&quot; The Blakes purchased a pump organ for US$75.00, making payments of 25 cents a week. When Blake was seven, he received music lessons from a neighbor, Margaret Marshall, an organist for the Methodist church. At age 15, without his parents&#x27; knowledge, he began playing piano at Aggie Shelton&#x27;s Baltimore bordello. Blake gained his first big break in the music business in 1907, when world champion boxer Joe Gans hired him to play the piano at Gans&#x27;s Goldfield Hotel, the first &quot;black and tan club&quot; in Baltimore. Blake played at the Goldfield during the winters from 1907 to 1914, and spent his summers playing clubs in Atlantic City. During this period, he also studied composition in Baltimore with Llewellyn Wilson.

According to Blake, he also worked the medicine show circuit and was employed by a Quaker doctor. He played a melodeon strapped to the back of the medicine wagon. He stayed with the show only two weeks, however, because the doctor&#x27;s religion didn&#x27;t allow the serving of Sunday dinner.

Blake said he composed the melody of &quot;Charleston Rag&quot; in 1899, when he would have been only 12 years old. He did not commit it to paper until 1915, when he learned musical notation.

In 1912, Blake began playing in vaudeville with James Reese Europe&#x27;s Society Orchestra, which accompanied Vernon and Irene Castle&#x27;s ballroom dance act. The band played ragtime music, which was still quite popular. Shortly after World War I, Blake formed a vaudeville musical act, the Dixie Duo, with performer Noble Sissle. After vaudeville, they began work on a musical revue, &quot;Shuffle Along&quot;, which incorporated songs they had written, and had a book written by F. E. Miller and Aubrey Lyles. When it premiered in June 1921, &quot;Shuffle Along&quot; became the first hit musical on Broadway written by and about African Americans. It also introduced hit songs such as &quot;I&#x27;m Just Wild About Harry&quot; and &quot;Love Will Find a Way&quot;. Rudolf Fisher insisted that &quot;Shuffle Along&quot; &quot;had ruined his favorite places of African-American sociability in Harlem&quot; due to the influx of white patrons. Its reliance on &quot;stereotypical black stage humor&quot; and &quot;the primitivist conventions of cabaret,&quot; in the words of Thomas Brothers, made the show a hit, running for 504 performances with three years of national tours.

Blake made his first recordings in 1917, for the Pathé record label and for Ampico piano rolls. In the 1920s he recorded for the Victor and Emerson labels, among others.

In 1923, Blake made three films for Lee de Forest in de Forest&#x27;s Phonofilm sound-on-film process: &quot;Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake&quot;, featuring their song &quot;Affectionate Dan&quot;; &quot;Sissle and Blake Sing Snappy Songs&quot;, featuring &quot;Sons of Old Black Joe&quot; and &quot;My Swanee Home&quot;; and &quot;Eubie Blake Plays His Fantasy on Swanee River&quot;, featuring Blake performing his &quot;Fantasy on Swanee River&quot;. These films are preserved in the Maurice Zouary film collection in the Library of Congress collection. Blake also appeared in Warner Brothers&#x27; 1932 short film &quot;Pie, Pie Blackbird&quot; with the Nicholas Brothers, Nina Mae McKinney and Noble Sissle. That year, he and his orchestra also provided most of the music for the film &quot;Harlem Is Heaven&quot;.

==Later life==
In July 1910, Blake married Avis Elizabeth Cecelia Lee, proposing to her in a chauffeur-driven car he hired. They met around 1895, when they attended Primary School No. 2 at 200 East Street in Baltimore. In 1910, Blake brought his bride to Atlantic City, New Jersey, where he had already found employment at the Boathouse nightclub.

In 1938, Avis was diagnosed with tuberculosis. She died later that year, at the age of 58. Of his loss, Blake said, &quot;In my life I never knew what it was to be alone. At first when Avis got sick, I thought she just had a cold, but when time passed and she didn’t get better, I made her go to a doctor and we found out she had TB … I suppose I knew from when we found out she had the TB, I understood that it was just a matter of time.&quot;

While serving as bandleader with the USO during World War II, he met Marion Grant Tyler, the widow of violinist Willy Tyler. They married in 1945. A performer and businesswoman, she became his valued business manager until her death in 1982. In 1946, Blake retired from performing and enrolled in New York University, where he studied the Schillinger System of music composition, graduating in two and a half years. He spent the next two decades using the Schillinger System to transcribe songs that he had memorized but had never written down.

In the 1970s and 1980s, public interest in Blake&#x27;s music was revived following the release of his 1969 retrospective album &quot;The Eighty-Six Years of Eubie Blake.&quot;

Blake was a frequent guest of &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; and &quot;Merv Griffin&quot;. He was featured by leading conductors, such as Leonard Bernstein and Arthur Fiedler. In 1977 he played Will Williams in the Jeremy Kagan biographical film &quot;Scott Joplin&quot;. By 1975, he had been awarded honorary doctorates from Rutgers, the New England Conservatory, the University of Maryland, Morgan State University, Pratt Institute, Brooklyn College, and Dartmouth. On October 9, 1981, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Ronald Reagan.

&quot;Eubie!&quot;, a revue featuring Blake&#x27;s music, with lyrics by Noble Sissle, Andy Razaf, Johnny Brandon, F. E. Miller and Jim Europe, opened on Broadway in 1978. It was a hit at the Ambassador Theatre, where it ran for 439 performances. It received three nominations for Tony Awards, including one for Blake&#x27;s score. The show was filmed in 1981 with the original cast members, including Lesley Dockery, Gregory Hines and Maurice Hines.

Blake performed with Gregory Hines on the television program &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on March 10, 1979 (season 4, episode 14).

==Death==
Blake continued to play and record until his death, on February 12, 1983, in Brooklyn, five days after events celebrating his purported 100th birthday (which was actually his 96th birthday).

He was interred in Cypress Hills Cemetery in Queens, New York. His headstone, engraved with the musical notation of &quot;I&#x27;m Just Wild About Harry&quot;, was commissioned by the African Atlantic Genealogical Society.

Blake was reported to have said, on his birthday in 1979, &quot;If I&#x27;d known I was going to live this long, I would have taken better care of myself&quot;, but this has been attributed to others and has appeared in print at least as early as 1966.

<text>The Parti Québécois (, , PQ) is a sovereignist and social democratic provincial political party in Quebec, Canada. The PQ advocates national sovereignty for Quebec involving independence of the province of Quebec from Canada and establishing a sovereign state. The PQ has also promoted the possibility of maintaining a loose political and economic sovereignty-association between Quebec and Canada. The party traditionally has support from the labour movement; however, unlike most other social democratic parties, its ties with organized labour are informal. Members and supporters of the PQ are nicknamed &quot;péquistes&quot; ( , ), a French word derived from the pronunciation of the party&#x27;s initials.

The party is an associate member of COPPPAL. The party has strong informal ties to the Bloc Québécois (BQ, whose members are known as &quot;Bloquistes&quot;), the federal party that has also advocated for the secession of Quebec from Canada, but the two are not linked organizationally. As with its federal counterpart, the Parti Québécois has been supported by a wide range of voters in Quebec, from large sections of organized labour to more conservative rural voters.

==History==

===Formation===
The PQ is the result of the 1968 merger between the Mouvement Souveraineté-Association, founded by René Lévesque (a former Quebec Liberal Party cabinet minister), and the Ralliement national. Following the creation of the PQ, the Rassemblement pour l&#x27;Indépendance Nationale held a general assembly that voted to dissolve the RIN. Its former members were invited to join the new Parti Québécois.

The PQ&#x27;s primary goals were to obtain political, economic and social autonomy for the province of Quebec. Lévesque introduced the strategy of referendums early in the 1970s.

===Lévesque and the PQ&#x27;s first government===
The PQ faced its first electoral test in the 1970 provincial election, winning seven seats. However, Lévesque was unable to get into the renamed National Assembly. Although it lost one seat in 1973, the decimation of the other parties, particularly the , allowed it to become the official opposition even though Lévesque was still unable to win a seat.

In the 1976 provincial election, the Parti Québécois won government for the first time and took 71 of the 110 seats available. Lévesque became the Premier of Quebec. This provided cause for celebration among many French-speaking Quebecers, while it resulted in an acceleration of the migration of the province&#x27;s Anglophone population and related economic activity toward Toronto.

The first PQ government was known as the &quot;republic of professors&quot; because of the large number of scholars in Lévesque&#x27;s cabinet. The PQ was the first government to recognize the rights of Aboriginal peoples to self-determination, insofar as this self-determination did not affect the territorial integrity of Quebec. The PQ passed laws on public consultations and the financing of political parties, which ensured equal financing of political parties and limited contributions by individuals to $3000. However, the most prominent legacy of the PQ is the Charter of the French Language (Bill 101), a framework law which defines the linguistic primacy of French and seeks to make French the common public language of Quebec. It allowed the advancement of francophones towards management roles, until then largely out of their reach. Despite the fact that 85% of the population spoke French and most of them did not understand English, the language of management was English in most medium and large businesses. Critics, both Francophone and Anglophone, have however criticized the charter for restraining citizens&#x27; linguistic school choice, as it only permits anglophones to attend English-language schools funded by the state (private schools remained an option for those who could afford tuition). The Parti Québécois initiated the 1980 Quebec referendum seeking a mandate to begin negotiation for sovereignty-association. It was rejected by 60 per cent of voters.

The party was re-elected in the 1981 election, but in November 1984 it experienced the most severe internal crisis of its existence. Lévesque wanted to focus on governing Quebec rather than sovereignty, and also wanted to adopt a more conciliatory approach on constitutional issues. This angered the more ardent sovereigntists, known as the &quot;purs et durs&quot;. Lévesque was forced to resign as a result. In September 1985, the party leadership election chose Pierre-Marc Johnson as his successor.

Despite its social democratic past, the PQ failed to gain admission into the Socialist International, after the membership application was vetoed by the federal New Democratic Party.

===1985 defeat===
The PQ led by Johnson was defeated by the Quebec Liberal Party in the 1985 election that saw Robert Bourassa return as premier. The Liberals served in office for two terms and attempted to negotiate a constitutional settlement with the rest of Canada but with the failure of the Meech Lake Accord and the Charlottetown Accord, two packages of proposed amendments to the Canadian constitution, the question of Quebec&#x27;s status remained unresolved and the Quebec sovereignty movement revived.

===Return to power under Parizeau===
The PQ returned to power under the leadership of hardline sovereigntist Jacques Parizeau in the 1994 Quebec election. This saw the PQ win 77 seats and 44% of the vote, on a promise to hold an independence referendum within a year. The following year, Parizeau called the 1995 Quebec referendum proposing negotiations on sovereignty. Again, the sovereigntists lost the vote. The final count showed 49.42% of voters supported negotiations that could eventually lead to sovereignty. On the night of the defeat, an emotionally drained Premier Parizeau stated that the loss was caused by &quot;money and ethnic votes&quot; (which led to accusations that Parizeau was racist) as well as by the divided votes amongst francophones. Parizeau resigned the next day (as he is alleged to have planned in case of a defeat).

===Bouchard government===
Lucien Bouchard, a former member of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney&#x27;s Cabinet and later founder of the Bloc Québécois, a federal-level sovereigntist party, succeeded Parizeau as PQ leader, but chose not to call another referendum due to the absence of &quot;winning conditions&quot;. Bouchard&#x27;s government then balanced the provincial budget – a feat achieved in Canada only by the federal government and a few of the ten Canadian provinces at that point – by reducing government spending, including social programs. The PQ was re-elected in the 1998 election, despite receiving fewer votes than the Quebec Liberal Party led by former federal deputy prime minister Jean Charest. Bouchard resigned in 2001, and was succeeded as PQ leader and Quebec Premier by Bernard Landry, a former PQ Finance minister. Under Landry&#x27;s leadership, the party lost the 2003 election to Jean Charest&#x27;s Liberals.

===Return to opposition===
Mid-late 2004 was difficult for Landry&#x27;s leadership, which was being contested. A vote was held during the party&#x27;s June 2005 convention to determine whether Landry continued to have the confidence of the party membership. Landry said he wanted at least 80% of approval and after gaining 76.2% approval on the confidence vote from party membership on 4 June 2005, Landry announced his intention to resign.

Louise Harel had been chosen to replace him until a new leader, André Boisclair, was elected 15 November 2005, through the party&#x27;s 2005 leadership election. At the time of Boisclair&#x27;s election, the PQ was as much as 20% ahead of the Liberals in opinion polls, suggesting that Boisclair would lead them to a landslide majority government in the next election.

===Splintering on the right and the left===
Progressives on the left wing of the PQ perceived a rightward move by the party towards neoliberalism under Bouchard, Landry and Boisclair. In 2006, a new left-wing party, Québec solidaire, was formed which included many activists who likely would formerly have been members or supporters of the PQ. Over subsequent elections, the QS attracted increasing support from left-wing sovereigntists disillusioned with the PQ. At the same time on the right, the ADQ and later the Coalition Avenir Québec attracted the votes of right-wing and soft sovereigntists who eventually become Quebec autonomists and Canadian federalists while retaining their Quebec nationalist identities. These political developments resulted in the PQ being squeezed from both sides.

===Third place===
The PQ was unable to maintain the momentum it briefly had under Boisclair, and in the 2007 provincial election, the party fell to 36 seats and behind the conservative Action démocratique du Québec (ADQ) in number of seats and the popular vote: this was the first time since 1973 that the party did not form the government or the Official Opposition. Boisclair said that the voters clearly did not support a strategy of a rapid referendum in the first mandate of a PQ government. Instead of a policy convention following the election, the party held a presidents&#x27; council. The party caucus in the provincial legislative assembly was said to have supported Boisclair continuing as leader.

On 8 May 2007, Boisclair announced his resignation as leader of the PQ. This was effective immediately, although Boisclair confirmed he would remain within the PQ caucus for the time being. He was replaced by veteran MNA François Gendron, pending a leadership race and convention.
Former Bloc Québécois leader Gilles Duceppe was the first to announce his intention to run for party leadership, on 11 May 2007. He was followed the same day by Pauline Marois. In a surprise move, Duceppe withdrew on the 12th – leaving Marois the only declared candidate. No other candidates came forward, and on 26 June 2007, Marois won the leadership by acclamation.

In June 2011, the party was shaken when four of its most prominent MNAs — popular actor Pierre Curzi, former cabinet minister Louise Beaudoin, and Lisette Lapointe, the wife of former premier Jacques Parizeau, and Jean-Martin Aussant — quit the party to sit as independents. They disagreed with Marois&#x27;s support for a bill changing the law to permit an agreement between the City of Québec and Quebecor Inc. concerning the management of the new sports and entertainment complex in Quebec City. Unrest continued later in the month when a fifth MNA, Benoit Charette, also quit, citing his dissatisfaction with the party&#x27;s sole focus being sovereignty. Beaudoin rejoined the PQ caucus in 2012.

===Marois minority government===
The party won a minority government under Marois in the 2012 provincial election with 54 of 125 seats in the National Assembly. It embarked on a program of &quot;sovereigntist governance&quot; in relations with the rest of Canada, to return Quebec to balanced budgets through higher taxes and debt reduction, to increase the use of French in public services, and to address resource development in Northern Quebec. However the PQ&#x27;s &#x27;new Bill 101&#x27; did not pass. The centrepiece of the government&#x27;s program was a Quebec Charter of Values which would have curtailed minority religious identity by banning the wearing of religious symbols by those in the employ of the government, particularly Sikh turbans, Muslim veils and Jewish kippahs.

===2014 defeat===
Based on the charter&#x27;s growing popularity among francophones, Marois called an early election for 7 April 2014 in an attempt to win a majority government. Despite leading in the polls when the writ was dropped, the campaign went badly due to several mishaps. The recruitment of star candidate Pierre Karl Péladeau, whose comments made sovereignty and the prospect of another referendum a focus of the campaign, as well as feminist Janette Bertrand suggesting that wealthy Muslim men were taking over swimming pools, among other incidents badly hurt the PQ. Marois&#x27; government was defeated by the Liberals, led by Philippe Couillard, in the 2014 provincial election which resulted in a Liberal majority government. The PQ won 25% of the vote and 30 seats, its worst result in terms of popular vote since 1970. Marois lost her own seat, and announced her intention to resign as PQ leader that night.

Stéphane Bédard was chosen interim parliamentary leader by the PQ caucus on 10 April 2014.

In the 20 October 2014 Lévis by-election, PQ candidate Alexandre Bégin came in third place, with 8.28% of the popular vote, only narrowly beating Québec Solidaire.

===Péladeau leadership===

On 27 November 2014, Pierre Karl Péladeau announced his intentions to run for PQ&#x27;s leadership, joining Bernard Drainville, Martine Ouellet, Jean-François Lisée, Alexandre Cloutier, and Pierre Céré.

Despite a fiercely contested race, Péladeau was the frontrunner for much of the campaign, causing Jean-François Lisée to drop out in January 2015, Bernard Drainville to drop out on 22 April 2015, and Pierre Céré to follow Drainville only five days before the leadership election.

On 15 May 2015, Pierre Karl Péladeau was elected permanent leader.

On 2 May 2016, Péladeau announced that he was retiring from politics to dedicate more time to his family.

===Jean-François Lisée leadership===
Jean-François Lisée was elected leader of Parti Québécois on 7 October 2016.

Lisée charged Manon Massé with reneging in unsuccessful deliberations for a putative electoral alliance between the Parti Québécois and Québec Solidaire in 2017.

===Collapse and brief loss of official party status===
For the 2018 provincial election, the PQ ruled out holding a referendum on sovereignty until 2022 at the earliest. With the sovereignty issue taken off the table for the first time in almost half a century, the 2018 election unfolded in a historic way, being the first time in a half century a party other than the Parti Québécois or Liberals were elected to power, with a Coalition Avenir Québec majority win. It also marked the first time in 42 years that the Parti Québécois did not win enough seats to maintain official status in the legislature. With only 10 seats won, not only did it lose official status, but was relegated to third place (tied with Québec solidaire). The PQ was reduced to its smallest presence in the National Assembly since its first election in 1970. In this election the Parti Québécois only garnered 17% of the popular vote, the lowest score in party&#x27;s history at the time.

With few exceptions, its support bled to the CAQ, which took several ridings that had been in PQ hands for 40 years or more, by large margins in many cases. A number of longtime PQ supporters defected to the CAQ because they no longer believed sovereignty was a realistic goal. Notably, the party was completely shut out of Montreal for the first time in memory, including its traditional stronghold in the heavily francophone eastern portion. Historically, when the PQ won government, the eastern half of the Island of Montreal was coated light blue. Many younger sovereigntists defected to Québec Solidaire.

Leader Jean-François Lisée was defeated in his own riding and resigned thereafter, accepting the blame for his party&#x27;s failure and collapse. After 50 years in the forefront of Quebec politics, the Parti Québécois had been pushed into marginal status. According to &quot;The Globe and Mail,&quot; within hours of the results being known, there was speculation that the party&#x27;s very survival was in doubt; there were concerns that it was no longer capable of attracting enough support &quot;to justify its political usefulness&quot;. Christian Bourque of Montreal-based pollster Léger Marketing suggested that the PQ was likely finished in its present form, and would have to merge with another sovereigntist party to avoid fading into irrelevance. On 27 November 2018, the CAQ granted both the PQ and Québec Solidaire official status in the legislature, despite the parties being short on seats and percentage of the popular vote in order to qualify.

However, on 11 March 2019, Catherine Fournier, the youngest MNA in the party and the province and the only PQ MNA from Greater Montreal, resigned from the Parti Québécois to sit as an independent, claiming the party had lost its way. At the same time, several members of the PQ&#x27;s youth wing expressed concern that the party might not have a future. Fournier&#x27;s defection dropped the party into fourth place, losing its standing as second opposition and potentially losing their official party status once again.

The next leadership election occurred on 9 October 2020, with lawyer Paul St-Pierre Plamondon being elected as the tenth Parti Québécois leader.

===Fading out and loss of official party status===
The 2022 provincial election saw even further erosion and an unprecedented loss of support for the Parti Quebecois. Not only did the party once again not form government or the official opposition, but it was reduced to its smallest-ever presence in the legislature, with only three seats won. The previous low was its second election, in 1973, where the party won six seats. Although new party leader Paul St-Pierre Plamondon managed to win his seat, the PQ lost its official party status and came in a distant fourth place. It won only 14 percent of the vote, its lowest ever. The movement of most voter support over to the CAQ and other nationalist parties put into question the party&#x27;s relevance and its ability to survive in future.

===Barred from Quebec legislature===
On December 1, 2022, the PQ&#x27;s three newly elected members were barred from the Quebec legislature following their refusal to swear an oath to the King, as required by the Constitution Act, 1867. In response, on December 9, 2022, the CAQ passed a bill abolishing the requirement, allowing the PQ into the legislature by early 2023, however its legality is being questioned.

After the 2022 provincial election, the PQ held a leadership confidence vote in March 2023. Plamondon broke a record for the PQ votes of confidence, with 98.51% support.

Since the 2022 election, the PQ saw an increase in its support in polls with them polling as the second largest party but still behind the CAQ.

On October 2, 2023, the PQ won its fourth seat with its win in the 2023 Jean-Talon provincial by-election, with Pascal Paradis being elected MNA.

Since November 2023, the PQ has been polling as the largest party with support over 30%.

==Relationship with the Bloc Québécois==
The Bloc Québécois (BQ) is a federal political party founded in 1990 by former Progressive Conservative MP Lucien Bouchard. It has traditionally had close ties to the Parti Québécois and shares its principal objective of sovereignty. The two parties have frequently shared political candidates, and have supported each other during election campaigns. The two parties have a similar membership and voter base. Prominent members of either party often attend and speak at both organizations&#x27; public events. Gilles Duceppe, the former Bloc leader, is also the son of Jean Duceppe, a Quebec actor who helped found the PQ after having been a founding member of the New Democratic Party.

In June 2014, Mario Beaulieu, a former PQ riding president and Bloc candidate, was elected leader of the Bloc Québécois. Notwithstanding his previous ties to both parties, Beaulieu has been critical of what he sees as a too timid approach to sovereignty by both the Bloc and PQ. Beaulieu&#x27;s election as Bloc leader was more warmly received by the PQ&#x27;s rival party, Option nationale, than by the PQ.

===Ties to far right groups===
In 2018, the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; reported on an investigation into two closed Facebook groups, whose stated aim is to bolster the PQ, by anti-racist activist Jeff Ray. Ray found that many participants, while supporters of the PQ, were also members of far-right groups like La Meute and Storm Alliance. This included &quot;grassroots activists to aspiring candidates to officials on the executive council&quot; on the PQ side, and &quot;key personalities of the far right&quot; on the other.

==Logo==
The party&#x27;s distinctive logo was designed in 1968 by painter and poet Roland Giguère. It consists of a stylised letter Q, represented by a blue circle broken by a red arrow. The creator meant it as an allegory of the Parti Québécois breaking the circle of colonialism which he claimed Canada was imposing on Quebec and opening Quebec upon the world and the future. The PQ has made very few significant modifications to its logo during its history. In 1985 it made the circle and arrow slightly thicker, and placed the tip of the latter at the centre of the circle. The original saw it span the whole diameter. When placed upon a blue background instead of a white one, the circle was commonly turned to white, the single main design variation currently observed.

The party revealed a new logo on 21 February 2007, at the beginning of the 2007 provincial election campaign. While maintaining the basic style of past logos, the Q was redesigned and modernized. In addition, the tail of the Q was recoloured green. 
This logo was replaced in 2021 with a new logo that incorporated the fleur-de-lis into the letter &quot;Q&quot;.
==Party policy==
The Parti Québécois centres on the protection of the Franco-Québécois identity, up to or including the ultimate result of sovereignty-association. Sovereigntism, however, is &#x27;Article 1&#x27; in its party program.

After then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy rejected the long-standing &quot;non-interference, non-indifference&quot; stance towards Quebec should it seek sovereignty in 2009, PQ leader and Premier Pauline Marois&#x27; visit to France in October 2012 saw her reinstate it with French President François Hollande. Also during her visit, Marois commented that &quot;Canada&#x27;s current foreign policy corresponds to neither our values nor our interests&quot;.

The PQ delivered a brief to the reasonable accommodation commission on minorities, which conducted hearings across the province. The commission briefing looked to reformulate the relations between Quebec&#x27;s francophone and minority populations. Its task was to be a platform for the PQ&#x27;s protectionism of French.

Marois stated there is nothing dogmatic in Francophones wishing to declare their existence even if it includes developing legislation requiring newcomers to have a basic understanding of French before becoming citizens of Quebec. (Note that there are no official citizens of Quebec; residents of Quebec are citizens of Canada.)

Further to her desire to protect French in Quebec, during Marois&#x27; visit to France in October 2012, she recommended that the &quot;French elite&quot; conduct themselves only in French on the international scene. However, some of Marois&#x27; international critics scoffed at her pretension that the &quot;French elite&quot; were Québécois.

Marois stated the PQ understands the arrival of newcomers is attractive and they &quot;contribute greatly&quot; to Quebec&#x27;s growth, but she stated that does not imply that to better assimilate them that &quot;we must erase our own history.&quot;

As of 2014, the PQ electoral program describes the party&#x27;s main commitment: &quot;Aspiring to political liberty, the Parti Québécois has as its first objective to achieve the sovereignty of Quebec after consulting the population by a referendum to be held at the moment that the government judges appropriate.&quot;

Other electoral issues were the Quebec Charter of Values, and language.

Like the Coalition Avenir Québec, the PQ supported the Quebec ban on face covering but also argued the ban is not extensive enough.

<text>Erhard Seminars Training, Inc. (marketed as est, though often encountered as EST or Est) was an organization founded by Werner Erhard in 1971 that offered a two-weekend (6-day, 60-hour) course known officially as &quot;The est Standard Training&quot;. The purpose of the training was to use concepts loosely based on Zen Buddhism for self improvement. The seminar aimed to &quot;transform one&#x27;s ability to experience living so that the situations one had been trying to change or had been putting up with clear up just in the process of life itself&quot;.

Est seminars operated from late 1971 to late 1984 and spawned a number of books from 1976 to 2011. Est has been featured in a number of films and television shows, including the critically acclaimed spy-series &quot;The Americans&quot;, broadcast from 2013 to 2018. Est represented an outgrowth of the Human Potential Movement of the 1960s through to the 1970s.

As est grew, so did criticisms. Various critics accused est of mind control or of forming an authoritarian army; some labeled it a cult.

The last est training took place in December 1984 in San Francisco. The seminars gave way to a &quot;gentler&quot; course offered by Werner Erhard and Associates and dubbed &quot;The Forum&quot; (currently named Landmark Worldwide), which began in January 1985.

== Training ==
The est Standard Training program consisted of two weekend-long workshops with evening sessions on the intervening weekdays. Workshops generally involved about 200 participants and were initially led by Erhard and later by people trained by him. Ronald Heifetz, founder of the Center for Public Leadership at Harvard University, called est &quot;an important experience in which two hundred people go through a powerful curriculum over two weekends and have a learning experience that seemed to change many of their lives.&quot; Trainers confronted participants one-on-one and challenged them to be themselves rather than to play a role that had been imposed on them by the past.

Jonathan D. Moreno observed that &quot;participants might have been surprised how both physically and emotionally challenging and how philosophical the training was.&quot; He writes that the critical part of the training was freeing oneself from the past, which was accomplished by &quot;experiencing&quot; one&#x27;s recurrent patterns and problems and choosing to change them. The word &quot;experience&quot; meant to bring into full awareness the repetition of old, burdensome behaviors. The seminar sought to enable participants to shift the state of mind around which their lives were organized, from attempts to get satisfaction or to survive, to actually being satisfied and experiencing themselves as whole and complete in the present moment.

Participants agreed to follow the ground rules, which included not wearing watches, not speaking until called upon, not talking to their neighbors, and not eating or leaving their seats to go to the bathroom except during breaks separated by many hours. Participants who were on medication were exempt from these rules, and had to sit in the back row so that they would not interfere with the other participants. These classroom agreements provided a rigorous setting whereby people&#x27;s ordinary ways to escape confronting their experience of themselves were eliminated. Moreno describes the est training as a form of &quot;Socratic interrogation...relying on the power of the shared cathartic experience that Aristotle observed.&quot; Erhard challenged participants to be themselves instead of playing a role that had been imposed on them and aimed to press people beyond their point of view, into a perspective from which they could observe their own positionality. As Robert Kiyosaki writes, &quot;During the training, it became glaringly clear that most of our personal problems begin with our not keeping our agreements, not being true to our words, saying one thing and doing another. That first full day on the simple class agreements was painfully enlightening. It became obvious that much of human misery is a function of broken agreements – not keeping your word, or someone else not keeping theirs.&quot;

Sessions lasted from 9:00 a.m. to midnight, or to the early hours of the morning, with one meal-break. Participants had to hand over wristwatches and were not allowed to take notes, or to speak unless called upon, in which case they waited for a microphone to be brought to them. The second day of the workshop featured the &quot;danger process&quot;. As a way of observing and confronting their own perspective and point of view, groups of participants were brought onto the stage and confronted. They were asked to &quot;imagine that they were afraid of everyone else and then that everyone else was afraid of them&quot; and to re-examine their reflex patterns of living that kept their lives from working. This was followed by interactions on the third and fourth days, covering topics such as reality and the nature of the mind, looking at the possibility that &quot;what is, is and what ain&#x27;t, ain&#x27;t,&quot; and that &quot;true enlightenment is knowing you are a machine&quot; and culminating in a realization that people do not need to be stuck with their automatic ways of being but can instead be free to choose their ways of being in how they live their lives. Participants were told they were perfect the way they were and were asked to indicate by a show of hands if they &quot;had gotten it&quot;.

Eliezer Sobel said in his article &quot;This is It: est, 20 Years Later&quot;: I considered the training to be a brilliantly conceived Zen koan, effectively tricking the mind into seeing itself, and in thus seeing, to be simultaneously aware of who was doing the seeing, a transcendent level of consciousness, a place spacious and undefined, distinct from the tired old story that our minds continuously tell us about who we are, and with which we ordinarily identify.
===Participants&#x27; reported results===
Many participants reported experiencing powerful results through their participation in the est training, characterised by Eliezer Sobel as perceived &quot;dramatic transformations in their relationships with their families, with their work and personal vision, or most important, with the recognition who they truly were in the core of their beings&quot;. One study of &quot;a large sample of est alumni who had completed the training at least 3 months before revealed that &quot;the large majority felt the experience had been positive (88%), and considered themselves better off for having taken the training (80%)&quot;.

== History ==
Werner Erhard reported having a personal transformation, and created the est training to allow others to have the same experience. The first &quot;est&quot; course was held at a Jack Tar Hotel in San Francisco, California, in October 1971. Within a year, trainings were being held in New York City and other major cities in the United States followed soon after. They were carried out by Werner Erhard, who had recently resigned from Mind Dynamics.

Beginning in July 1974 the est training was delivered at the U.S. Penitentiary at Lompoc, California, with the approval of the Federal Bureau of Prisons. Initial est training in Lompoc involved participation of 12–15 federal prisoners and outside community members within the walls of the maximum security prison and was personally conducted by Werner Erhard.

By 1979, est had expanded to Europe and other parts of the world. In 1980 the first est training in Israel was offered in Tel Aviv. The est training presented several concepts to these new attendees, most notably the concept of spiritual transformation and taking responsibility for one&#x27;s life. The actual teaching, called &quot;the technology of transformation,&quot; emphasizes the value of integrity. As est grew, so did criticism. It was accused of mind control and labeled a cult by some critics who said that it exploited its followers by recruiting and offering numerous &quot;graduate seminars.&quot;

In 1983 in the United States, a participant named Jack Slee collapsed during a portion of the seminar known as &quot;the danger process&quot; and died at the hospital to which he had been transported. A court subsequently found that the est training was not the cause of death. A jury later ruled that Erhard and his company had been negligent, but did not give Slee&#x27;s estate a monetary award.

According to a 1991 report by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, est had been the target of a smear campaign by the Church of Scientology. This campaign had spanned several years, with examples being found in documents seized by the FBI in 1977. This smear campaign involved hiring personal investigators to spy on Erhard, recruiting Scientologists to covertly enroll in and disrupt est courses, and compiling information from disgruntled former est participants which could be used to discredit est. Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard (who died in 1986) believed that Erhard had copied Scientology. Erhard disputed this, saying that est was essentially different despite some similarities.

In their 1992 book &quot;Perspectives on the New Age&quot; James R. Lewis and J. Gordon Melton said that similarities between est and Mind Dynamics were &quot;striking&quot;, as both used &quot;authoritarian trainers who enforce numerous rules,&quot; require applause after participants &quot;share&quot; in front of the group, and de-emphasize reason in favor of &quot;feeling and action.&quot; The authors also described graduates of est as &quot;fiercely loyal,&quot; and said that it recruited heavily, reducing marketing expenses to virtually zero. The last est training was held in December 1984 in San Francisco.

It was replaced by a gentler course called &quot;The Forum,&quot; which began in January 1985. &quot;est, Inc.&quot; evolved into &quot;est, an Educational Corporation,&quot; and eventually into Werner Erhard and Associates. In 1991 the business was sold to the employees who formed a new company called Landmark Education with Erhard&#x27;s brother, Harry Rosenberg, becoming the CEO. Landmark Education was structured as a for-profit, employee-owned company; since 2013, it operates as Landmark Worldwide with a consulting division called Vanto Group.

== Early influences ==

In W. W. Bartley III&#x27;s biography of Werner Erhard, &quot;Werner Erhard: The Transformation of a Man, the Founding of est&quot; (1978), Erhard describes his explorations of Zen Buddhism. Bartley quotes Erhard as acknowledging Zen as the essential contribution that &quot;created the space [for est]&quot;.

Bartley details Erhard&#x27;s connections with Zen beginning with his extensive studies with Alan Watts in the mid-1960s.
Bartley quotes Erhard as acknowledging:
Other influences included Dale Carnegie, Subud, Scientology and Mind Dynamics.

<text>The Temple of Kom Ombo is an unusual double temple in the town of Kom Ombo in Aswan Governorate, Upper Egypt. It was constructed during the Ptolemaic dynasty, 180–47 BC. Some additions to it were later made during the Roman period.

==Architecture==

The building is unique because its &#x27;double&#x27; design meant that there were courts, halls, sanctuaries and rooms duplicated for two sets of gods. The southern half of the temple was dedicated to the crocodile god Sobek, god of fertility and creator of the world with Hathor and Khonsu. Meanwhile, the northern part of the temple was dedicated to the falcon god Haroeris (&quot;Horus the Elder&quot;), along &quot;with Tasenetnofret (the Good Sister, a special form of Hathor or Tefnet/Tefnut) and Panebtawy (Lord of the Two Lands)&quot;. The temple is atypical because everything is perfectly symmetrical along the main axis.

==Decorations==

The texts and reliefs in the temple refer to cultic liturgies which were similar to those from that time period. The temple itself had a specific theology. The characters invoked the gods of Kom Ombo and their legend. Two themes were present in this temple: the universalist theme and the local theme. The two combine to form the theology of this temple. A temple was already built in the New Kingdom to honor these gods, however, this site gained in importance during the Ptolemaic Kingdom. Little remains of the New Kingdom temple. The existing temple was begun by Ptolemy VI Philometor (180–145 BC) at the beginning of his reign and added to by other Ptolemies, most notably Ptolemy XIII Theos Philopator (51–47 BC), who built the inner and outer hypostyles. The scene on the inner face of the rear wall of the temple is of particular interest, and &quot;probably represents a set of surgical instruments&quot;.

==Current state==

Much of the temple has been destroyed by the Nile, earthquakes, and later builders who used its stones for other projects. Some of the reliefs inside were defaced by Copts, who once used the temple as a church. All the temples buildings in the southern part of the plateau were cleared of debris and restored by Jacques de Morgan in 1893.

==Crocodile Museum==

A few of the three hundred crocodile mummies discovered in the vicinity are displayed in The Crocodile Museum.

In April 2018, the Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities announced the discovery of the head of the bust of Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius during work to protect the site from groundwater.

In September 2018, the Egyptian antiquities ministry announced that a sandstone sphinx statue had been discovered at the temple. The statue, measuring approximately in width and in height, likely dates to the Ptolemaic Dynasty.

<doc id="106374" wikidata="Q523957" url="?curid=106374" title="Funkadelic">
<text>Funkadelic was an American funk rock band formed in Plainfield, New Jersey in 1968 and active until 1982. As one of the two flagship groups of George Clinton&#x27;s P-Funk collective, they helped pioneer the funk music culture of the 1970s. Funkadelic initially formed as a backing band for Clinton&#x27;s vocal group the Parliaments (later the full-fledged band Parliament), but eventually pursued a heavier, psychedelic rock-oriented sound in their own recordings. They released acclaimed albums such as &quot;Maggot Brain&quot; (1971) and &quot;One Nation Under a Groove&quot; (1978).

== History ==
=== Background ===
The group that would become Funkadelic was formed by George Clinton in 1964, as the unnamed backing section for his doo wop group the Parliaments while on tour. The band originally consisted of musicians Frankie Boyce, Richard Boyce, and Langston Booth plus the five members of the Parliaments on vocals. Boyce, Boyce, and Booth enlisted in the Army in 1966, and Clinton recruited bassist Billy Bass Nelson and guitarist Eddie Hazel in 1967, then added guitarist Tawl Ross and drummer Tiki Fulwood. The name &quot;Funkadelic&quot; was coined by Nelson after the band relocated to Detroit. By 1968, because of a dispute with Revilot, the record company that owned the Parliaments&#x27; name, the ensemble began playing under the name Funkadelic.

=== Psychedelic era ===
As Funkadelic, the group signed to Westbound in 1968. Around this time, the group&#x27;s music evolved from soul and doo wop into a harder guitar-driven mix of psychedelic rock, soul and funk, much influenced by the popular musical (and political) movements of the time. Jimi Hendrix, Sly Stone, the MC5, and Vanilla Fudge were major inspirations. This style later evolved into a tighter guitar and horns-based funk (circa 1971–75), which subsequently, during the height of Parliament-Funkadelic success (circa 1976–81), added elements of R&amp;B and electronic music, with fewer psychedelic rock elements. The band made their first live television performance on &quot;Say Brother&quot; on October 7, 1969. They played a jam with songs &quot;Into My Own Thing&quot; (Sly and the Family Stone cover), &quot;What Is Soul?&quot;, &quot;(I Wanna) Testify&quot;, &quot;I Was Made to Love Her&quot; (Stevie Wonder cover), &quot;Friday Night, August 14th&quot; and &quot;Music for My Mother&quot;.

The group&#x27;s self-titled debut album, &quot;Funkadelic&quot;, was released in 1970. The credits listed organist Mickey Atkins plus Clinton, Fulwood, Hazel, Nelson, and Ross. The recording also included the rest of Parliament&#x27;s singers (still uncredited because of contractual concerns), several uncredited session musicians then employed by Motown, as well as Ray Monette (of Rare Earth) and future P-Funk mainstay Bernie Worrell.

Bernie Worrell was officially credited starting with Funkadelic&#x27;s second album, &quot;Free Your Mind... and Your Ass Will Follow&quot; (1970), thus beginning a long working relationship between Worrell and Clinton. The album &quot;Maggot Brain&quot; followed in 1971. The first three Funkadelic albums displayed strong psychedelic influences (not least in terms of production) and limited commercial potential, despite containing many songs that stayed in the band&#x27;s setlist for several years and would influence many future funk, rock, and hip hop artists.

After the release of &quot;Maggot Brain&quot;, the Funkadelic lineup expanded greatly. Tawl Ross was unavailable after experiencing either a bad LSD trip or a speed overdose, while Billy Bass Nelson and Eddie Hazel quit due to financial concerns. From this point, many more musicians and singers would be added during Funkadelic&#x27;s (and Parliament&#x27;s) history, including the recruitment of several members of James Brown&#x27;s backing band, the JB&#x27;s, in 1972 – most notably Bootsy Collins and the Horny Horns. Bootsy and his brother Catfish Collins were recruited by Clinton to replace the departed Nelson and Hazel. Bootsy in particular became a major contributor to the P-Funk sound. In 1972, this new line-up released the politically charged double album &quot;America Eats Its Young&quot;. The lineup stabilized a bit with the album &quot;Cosmic Slop&quot; in 1973, featuring major contributions from recently added singer-guitarist Garry Shider. After first leaving the band, Eddie Hazel spent a year in jail after assaulting an airline flight attendant and air marshal while under the influence of PCP, then he returned to make major contributions to the album &quot;Standing on the Verge of Getting It On&quot; (1974). Hazel only contributed to P-Funk sporadically thereafter.

=== P-Funk ===
George Clinton revived Parliament in 1974 and signed them to Casablanca Records. Parliament and Funkadelic featured mostly the same stable of personnel but operated concurrently under two names. At first, Parliament was designated as a more mainstream funk ensemble dominated by soulful vocals and horn arrangements, while Funkadelic was designated as a more experimental and freestyle guitar-based funk band. The ensemble usually toured under the combined name Parliament-Funkadelic or simply P-Funk (which also became the catch-all term for George Clinton&#x27;s rapidly growing stable of funk artists). In 1975, Funkadelic released its most successful album yet, &quot;Let&#x27;s Take It to the Stage&quot;, which nearly cracked the R&amp;B top ten and the Billboard 100.

Later in 1975 Michael Hampton, a teen guitar prodigy, replaced Hazel as the premier lead guitarist in Parliament-Funkadelic, and was a major contributor to the next several Funkadelic albums. Funkadelic left Westbound in 1976 and moved to Warner Brothers. Their first album for Warner was &quot;Hardcore Jollies&quot; released in 1976. Just before leaving Westbound, Clinton provided that label with a collection of recently recorded outtakes, which Westbound released as the album &quot;Tales of Kidd Funkadelic&quot;. That album did significantly better commercially than &quot;Hardcore Jollies&quot; and included &quot;Undisco Kidd&quot;, an R&amp;B Top 30 single. In 1977, Westbound capitalized further by releasing the anthology &quot;The Best of the Early Years&quot;.

=== Mainstream success ===
As Parliament began achieving significant mainstream success in the 1975–1978 period, Funkadelic recorded and released its most successful and influential album, &quot;One Nation Under a Groove&quot; in 1978, adding former Ohio Players keyboardist Walter &quot;Junie&quot; Morrison and reflecting a more melodic dance-based sound. The title track spent six weeks at #1 on the R&amp;B charts, around the time that Parliament was enjoying the #1 R&amp;B singles &quot;Flash Light&quot; and &quot;Aqua Boogie&quot;. &quot;Uncle Jam Wants You&quot; in 1979 continued Funkadelic&#x27;s new more electronic sound production. The album contains the fifteen-minute &quot;(Not Just) Knee Deep&quot; featuring former Spinners lead singer Philippé Wynne, an edited version of which topped the R&amp;B charts. The final official Funkadelic album, &quot;The Electric Spanking of War Babies&quot;, was released in 1981. The release was originally a double-album project, but it was reduced to a single disc under pressure from Warner Brothers. Some of the deleted tracks would appear on future P-Funk releases, most notably the 1982 hit single &quot;Atomic Dog&quot; which appeared on the first George Clinton solo album.

Meanwhile, the album &quot;Connections &amp; Disconnections&quot; (re-issued on CD as &quot;Who&#x27;s a Funkadelic&quot;) was released under the name Funkadelic in 1981. The album was recorded by former Funkadelic members and original Parliaments Fuzzy Haskins, Calvin Simon, and Grady Thomas, who had left P-Funk in 1977 after disagreements with George Clinton&#x27;s management practices. This LP, notable for its heavy use of Thomas &quot;Pae-dog&quot; McEvoy&#x27;s jazz horn, contains the track called &quot;You&#x27;ll Like It Too&quot;, which became a very popular breakbeat source for the hip hop community in the 1980s. Former band member drummer Jerome Brailey released the album &quot;Mutiny on the Mamaship&quot;, by his new band Mutiny.

=== Dissolution ===
In the early 1980s, with legal difficulties arising from the multiple names used by multiple groups, as well as a shakeup at Parliament&#x27;s record label, George Clinton dissolved Parliament and Funkadelic as recording and touring entities. However, many of the musicians in later versions of the two groups remained employed by Clinton. Clinton continued to release new albums regularly, sometimes under his own name and sometimes under the name George Clinton &amp; the P-Funk All-Stars. In the mid-1980s, the penultimate Funkadelic studio album &quot;By Way of the Drum&quot; was recorded by Clinton with P-Funk personnel and many electronic devices. The album was rejected by its record label and did not see official release in America until it appeared as a reissue in 2007. It features a cover of &quot;Sunshine Of Your Love&quot; by Cream. The album did not receive any publicity but still received favorable reviews.

=== Legacy ===
Clinton continued his P-Funk collective in the 1990s and 2000s, with a revolving stable of musicians, some of whom remain from the classic lineups of Funkadelic and Parliament. The rock-oriented sound of Funkadelic has diminished, as Clinton has moved towards more of an R&amp;B and hip hop sound. In 1997 the group was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Filmmaker Yvonne Smith of New York City-based Brazen Hussy productions produced &quot;Parliament-Funkadelic: One Nation Under a Groove,&quot; a full-length documentary about the groundbreaking group, which aired on PBS in 2005. As of 2008, Clinton was at work on a new Funkadelic album for his new record label. In November 2008, Westbound Records released &quot;Toys&quot;, a collection of Funkadelic outtakes and demos from the &quot;Free Your Mind&quot; and &quot;America Eats Its Young&quot; era. Critical reception of the album has generally been positive. In April 2013, the band released their first single in over 25 years when they released &quot;The Naz&quot;. The song is a collaboration with Sly Stone and tells the story of Jesus Christ. The B-side to the song is &quot;Nuclear Dog&quot; which is guitar solo by P-Funk guitarist Dewayne &quot;Blackbyrd&quot; McKnight.

Funkadelic had a major influence on a large number of hip-hop artists, and the genre of hip-hop as a whole. In particular, Dr. Dre references Funkadelic&#x27;s sound as a major influence on his music, especially his G-funk sound. Funkadelic&#x27;s 1979 release &quot;(Not Just) Knee Deep&quot; in particular was sampled extensively by G-Funk artists, including placements on Dr. Dre&#x27;s &quot;The Chronic&quot;, Snoop Dogg&#x27;s &quot;Doggystyle&quot;, MC Hammer&#x27;s &quot;Street Fighter OST&quot;, De La Soul&#x27;s &quot;Me Myself and I&quot; and Tupac&#x27;s &quot;All Eyez on Me&quot;.

<doc id="106376" wikidata="Q544024" url="?curid=106376" title="Gong (band)">
<text>Gong are a psychedelic rock band that incorporates elements of jazz and space rock into their musical style. The group was formed in Paris in 1967 by Australian musician Daevid Allen and English vocalist Gilli Smyth. Band members have included Didier Malherbe, Pip Pyle, Steve Hillage, Mike Howlett, Tim Blake, Pierre Moerlen, Bill Laswell and Theo Travis. Others who have played on stage with Gong include Don Cherry, Chris Cutler, Bill Bruford, Brian Davison, Dave Stewart and Tatsuya Yoshida.

Gong&#x27;s 1970 debut album, &quot;Magick Brother&quot;, featured a psychedelic rock sound. By the following year, the second album, &quot;Camembert Electrique&quot;, featured the more psychedelic rock/space rock sound with which they would be most associated. Between 1973 and 1974, Gong released their best-known work, the allegorical &quot;Radio Gnome Invisible&quot; trilogy, describing the adventures of Zero the Hero, the Good Witch Yoni and the Pot Head Pixies from the Planet Gong.

In 1975, Allen and Smyth left the band, which continued without them, releasing a series of jazz rock albums under the leadership of drummer Pierre Moerlen. This incarnation soon became known as Pierre Moerlen&#x27;s Gong. Meanwhile, Smyth formed Mother Gong while Allen initiated a series of spin-off groups, including Planet Gong, New York Gong and Gongmaison, before returning to lead Gong once again in 1990 until his death in 2015. With Allen&#x27;s encouragement, the band decided to continue as a quintet comprising guitarist Fabio Golfetti, bassist Dave Sturt, woodwind player Ian East, guitarist and vocalist Kavus Torabi, and drummer Cheb Nettles. They released the album &quot;Rejoice! I&#x27;m Dead!&quot; in September 2016, followed by &quot;The Universe Also Collapses&quot; in 2019 and &quot;Unending Ascending&quot; in 2023.

== History ==

=== Protogong (1967–68) ===
In September 1967, Australian singer and guitarist Daevid Allen, a member of the English psychedelic rock band Soft Machine, was denied re-entry to the United Kingdom for 3 years following a French tour because his visa had expired. He settled in Paris, where he and his partner, London-born Sorbonne professor Gilli Smyth, established the first incarnation of Gong (later referred to by Allen as &quot;Protogong&quot;) along with Ziska Baum on vocals and Loren Standlee on flute. However, the nascent band came to an abrupt end during the May 1968 student revolution, when Allen and Smyth were forced to flee the country after a warrant was issued for their arrest. They headed for Deià in Majorca, where they had lived for a time in 1966.

=== Gong &#x27;proper&#x27; begins (1969–1971) ===
In August 1969, film director Jérôme Laperrousaz, a close friend of the pair, invited them back to France to record a soundtrack for a motorcycle racing movie which he was planning. This came to nothing at the time, but they were subsequently approached by Jean Karakos of the newly formed independent label BYG Actuel to record an album, and so set about forming a new electric Gong band in Paris, recruiting their first rhythm section of Christian Tritsch (bass) and Rachid Houari (drums and percussion) and re-connecting with a saxophonist called Didier Malherbe whom they had met in Deià. However, Tritsch was not ready in time for the sessions and so Allen played the bass guitar himself. The album, entitled &quot;Magick Brother&quot;, was completed in October.

The reborn Gong played its debut gig at the BYG Actuel Festival in the small Belgian town of Amougies, on 27 October 1969, joined by Danny Laloux on hunting horn and percussion, and Dieter Gewissler and Gerry Fields on violin, and was introduced to the stage by bemused compere Frank Zappa. &quot;Magick Brother&quot; was released in March 1970, followed in April by a non-album single, &quot;Est-Ce Que Je Suis; Garçon Ou Fille?&quot; b/w &quot;Hip Hip Hypnotise Ya&quot;, which again featured Laloux and Gewissler. In October, the band moved into an abandoned 12-room hunting lodge called Pavillon du Hay, near Voisines and Sens, 120 km south-east of Paris. They would be based there until early 1974.

Houari left the band in the spring of 1971 and was replaced by English drummer Pip Pyle, whom Allen had been introduced to by Robert Wyatt during the recording of his debut solo album, &quot;Banana Moon&quot;. The new line-up recorded a soundtrack for Laperrousaz&#x27;s movie, now entitled &quot;Continental Circus&quot;, backed poet Dashiell Hedayat on his album &quot;Obsolete&quot;, and played at the second Glastonbury Festival, later documented on the &quot;Glastonbury Fayre&quot; album. Next, they began work on their second studio album, &quot;Camembert Electrique&quot;, later referred to by Allen as &quot;the first real band album&quot;. It established the progressive, space rock sound which would make their name, leading, in the autumn, to their first UK tour. However, by the end of the year Pyle had left the group, to be replaced by another English drummer, Laurie Allan.

=== The &quot;Radio Gnome Invisible&quot; trilogy (1972–74) ===
Gong went through increasing line-up disruption in 1972. Laurie Allan left in April to be replaced by Mac Poole, then Charles Hayward and then Rob Tait, before returning again late in the year. Gilli Smyth left for a time, returning to Deià, Majorca to look after her and Daevid Allen&#x27;s baby son, and was replaced by Diane Stewart, who was the partner of Tait and the ex-wife of Graham Bond. Christian Tritsch moved to guitar and was replaced on bass by former Magma member Francis Moze, while the band&#x27;s sound was expanded with the addition of synthesizer player Tim Blake in late 1972.

In October 1972, they were one of the first acts to sign to Richard Branson&#x27;s fledgling Virgin Records label, and in late December, they traveled to Virgin&#x27;s Manor Studio in Oxfordshire, England, to record their third album, &quot;Flying Teapot&quot;. In January 1973, towards the end of their recording sessions, they were joined by English guitarist Steve Hillage, whom they had met a few weeks earlier in France playing with Kevin Ayers. He arrived too late to contribute much to the album, but would soon become a key component in the Gong sound.

In March 1973, exhausted by Gong&#x27;s 1972 tour and the recording of &quot;Flying Teapot&quot;, Allen and Smyth left Gong and returned to Deià to take care of their baby Tally. Then drummer Laurie Allan and bassist Francis Moze also decided to depart. Tim Blake, Steve Hillage, Didier Malherbe, Venux De Luxe and the rest of the Gong family decided to continue as the short-lived band Paragong who enlisted drummer Pierre Moerlen and bassist Mike Howlett but existed only two short months, March and April 1973, and only ever played live in France. The only recording documenting Paragong live is the (22-minute) short album &quot;Live &#x27;73&quot; released in 1995 which consists of the two lengthy tracks &quot;Camembert Psilocybin Flashback&quot; and &quot;Porquoi Dormons Nous? (The Gnome Rock Dispensation)&quot;.

&quot;Flying Teapot&quot; was released on 25 May 1973, the same day as &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;, and was the first instalment of the &quot;Radio Gnome Invisible&quot; trilogy, which expounded upon the (previously only hinted at) Gong mythology developed by Allen. The second part, &quot;Angel&#x27;s Egg&quot;, followed in December, now featuring the &#x27;classic&#x27; rhythm section of Mike Howlett on bass and Pierre Moerlen on drums. In early 1974 Moerlen left to work with the French contemporary ensemble Les Percussions de Strasbourg and Smyth left to give birth to her and Allen&#x27;s second son. They were replaced once again by Rob Tait and Diane Stewart, and the band moved from its French base at Pavillon du Hay to an English one at Middlefield Farm, near Witney, Oxfordshire. Moerlen, and later Smyth, returned in order to complete the trilogy with the album &quot;You&quot;, but by the time of its release, in October 1974, Moerlen was back with Les Percussions de Strasbourg and Smyth had settled permanently in Deià with her young sons. Prior to touring in support of &quot;You&quot;, Allen visited Smyth and the boys in Deià, while the rest of the band, including the departed Moerlen, recorded the basic tracks for Hillage&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Fish Rising&quot;. Moerlen was initially replaced in Gong by a succession of stand-ins (Chris Cutler, Laurie Allan and Bill Bruford) until former Nice and Refugee drummer Brian Davison took the job in early 1975. Smyth had already been replaced by Hillage&#x27;s partner Miquette Giraudy.

In June 1974, &quot;Camembert Electrique&quot; was given a belated UK release by Virgin, priced at 59p, the price of a typical single at the time; a promotional gimmick which they had used before for Faust and would use again for a reggae compilation in 1976. These ultra-budget albums sold in large quantities because of the low price, but the pricing made them ineligible for placement on the album charts. The hope was that new fans would be encouraged to buy the groups&#x27; other albums at full price.

=== Daevid Allen&#x27;s departure and &quot;Shamal&quot; (1975–76) ===
Increasing tension and personality clashes led to Tim Blake being asked to leave in February 1975 during rehearsals for a tour. He was not replaced. Then, at a gig in Cheltenham on 10 April, the day before the release of Steve Hillage&#x27;s &quot;Fish Rising&quot; album, Daevid Allen refused to go on stage, claiming that a &quot;wall of force&quot; was preventing him from doing so, and he left the band. The others decided to carry on without him.

In August, Pierre Moerlen was persuaded to return, replacing the unhappy and alcoholic Davison, and the band now also added Mireille Bauer on percussion, Jorge Pinchevsky on violin and Patrice Lemoine on synthesizer and, for the first time in Gong, keyboards. They toured the UK in November 1975, as documented on the 2005 release &quot;Live in Sherwood Forest &#x27;75&quot;, and worked on material for their next album, &quot;Shamal&quot;. Hillage, however, was increasingly uncomfortable without Allen, and with now being seen as the band&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; leader. With a solo career beckoning, he and Giraudy decided to leave before &quot;Shamal&quot; was completed, participating in it only as guests. Howlett took over as lead male vocalist and Sandy Colley, Lemoine&#x27;s partner and the band&#x27;s cook, became his female counterpart. The album was released in February 1976 and they toured in support until a crisis was precipitated in May when Pinchevsky was refused entry to the U.K. for carrying marijuana. Ex-King Crimson violinist David Cross was tried out as a possible replacement, but before any progress could be made with this new line-up, the band split into two camps: Howlett wanted to keep vocals, but Moerlen and Bauer wanted the music to be entirely instrumental, with Malherbe undecided. Virgin Records executive Simon Draper chose Moerlen&#x27;s way and Howlett left, quickly followed by Lemoine and Colley.

=== Pierre Moerlen&#x27;s Gong and other &#x27;70s offshoots (1976–1980) ===
For contractual reasons, the Gong name remained in play for another two years, but the band was now effectively Pierre Moerlen&#x27;s Gong, having little to do with the psychedelic space rock of Daevid Allen. Moerlen formed a new mallet-percussion-based line-up, adding his brother Benoit Moerlen, future Weather Report percussionist Mino Cinelu, journeyman guitarist Allan Holdsworth and &quot;Flying Teapot&quot; bassist Francis Moze to record the album &quot;Gazeuse!&quot; in late 1976. Malherbe, Holdsworth, Moze and Cinelu all left soon afterwards, but Moerlen kept a band going with American bassist Hansford Rowe until the late 1980s. To avoid confusion, it first became known as Gong-Expresso and then, from 1978, as Pierre Moerlen&#x27;s Gong. One last album, &quot;Pentanine&quot;, was recorded in 2002 with Russian musicians before Moerlen died unexpectedly in May 2005, aged 53.

A Gong reunion event held in Paris in May 1977 brought together all of the current strands which had developed and re-asserted the primacy of the Daevid Allen-led band. It featured sets by Tim Blake, Lady June, Howlett&#x27;s Strontium 90, Steve Hillage, &#x27;Shamal Gong&#x27;, Gong-Expresso, Daevid Allen and Euterpe, and was headlined by Trilogy Gong, the classic lineup of Allen, Smyth, Malherbe, Blake, Hillage, Giraudy, Howlett and Moerlen. Their performance was documented on the live album &quot;Gong est Mort, Vive Gong&quot;. Strontium 90 was Mike Howlett&#x27;s short-lived band which was notable for having two bass players, and for introducing Police members Sting and Stewart Copeland to their future guitarist Andy Summers.

Daevid Allen continued to develop the Gong mythology in his solo albums and with two new bands: Planet Gong (1977), which comprised Allen and Smyth playing with the British festival band Here &amp; Now, and New York Gong (1979), comprising Allen and the American musicians who would later become known as Material. At the same time, Gilli Smyth formed Mother Gong with English guitarist/producer Harry Williamson and Didier Malherbe, and played in Spain and England. Allen delighted in this proliferation of groups and considered his role at this time to be that of an instigator, traveling around the world leaving active Gong-related bands in his wake.

=== Gongmaison and reunion (1989–1992) ===
After spending most of the Eighties in his native Australia, Allen returned to the UK in 1988 with a new project, The Invisible Opera Company of Tibet, whose revolving cast included violinist Graham Clark and Gong saxophonist Didier Malherbe. This morphed into Gongmaison in 1989, which added Harry Williamson from Mother Gong and had a techno-influenced sound with electronic beats, as well as live percussion from Shyamal Maïtra. In 1990, the Gong name was revived for a one-off U.K. T.V. appearance with a line-up featuring Allen, Smyth and Malherbe, plus early-&#x27;70s drummer Pip Pyle and three members of Here &amp; Now: Stephan Lewry (lead guitar), Keith Bailey (bass) and Paul Noble (synth). In April 1992, Gongmaison became Gong permanently with the combined line-up of Allen, Malherbe, Bailey and Pyle, plus Graham Clark and Shyamal Maïtra from Gongmaison. Together they recorded the album &quot;Shapeshifter&quot; (subsequently dubbed &quot;Radio Gnome Invisible, Part 4&quot;) and toured extensively.

=== 25th-anniversary celebration (1994) and worldwide touring (1996–2001) ===
In 1994, Gong celebrated its 25th birthday with a show in London which featured the return of Gilli Smyth, bassist Mike Howlett and lead guitarist Stephan Lewry of Here &amp; Now. This formed the basis of the band which toured worldwide from 1996 to 2001, with Pierre Moerlen replacing Pip Pyle on drums from 1997 through 1999. The album &quot;Zero to Infinity&quot; was released in 2000, by which time the line-up had changed again to Allen, Smyth, Malherbe and Howlett, plus new recruits on sax/keys and Chris Taylor on drums. This line-up was unique in the band&#x27;s history in having two sax/flute players.

=== Acid Mothers Gong (2003–04) ===
2003 saw a radical new line-up including Acid Mothers Temple members Kawabata Makoto and Cotton Casino, plus University of Errors guitarist Josh Pollock. Allen and Smyth&#x27;s son Orlando drummed on the 2004 studio album &quot;Acid Motherhood&quot;, but for the subsequent live dates the rhythm section was Ruins drummer Tatsuya Yoshida and Acid Mothers Temple bassist Tsuyama Atsushi. A live album recorded by this line-up in 2004 was released as &quot;Acid Mothers Gong Live Tokyo&quot; and they played a few more one-off shows in 2006 and 2007.

=== Gong Family Unconventions (2004–06) ===
The European version of Gong had retired from regular touring in 2001, but there were subsequent one-off reunions, most notably at the &quot;Gong Family Unconventions&quot; (Uncons), the first of which was held in 2004 in the Glastonbury Assembly Rooms as a one-day event and featured many ex-members and Gong family bands including Here &amp; Now, House of Thandoy, Thom the Poet, Invisible Opera Company, Andy Bole, Bubbledub and Joie Hinton. The 2005 Uncon was a 2-day affair featuring several Gong-related bands such as Here &amp; Now, System 7, House of Thandoy and Kangaroo Moon. The next Uncon was a 3-day event held at the Melkweg in Amsterdam on 3–5 November 2006, with practically all Gong-related bands present: &#x27;Classic&#x27; Gong (Allen, Smyth, Malherbe, Blake, Howlett, Travis, Taylor, plus the return of Steve Hillage and Miquette Giraudy), System 7, The Steve Hillage Band, Hadouk, Tim Blake and Jean-Philippe Rykiel, University of Errors, Here &amp; Now, Mother Gong, Zorch, Eat Static, Sacred Geometry Band, Acid Mothers Gong and many others. These events have all been compèred by Thom the Poet (now &quot;Thom Moon 10&quot;).

=== Gong Global Family (2007) ===
In November 2007, Daevid Allen held a series of concerts in Brazil with a new band which he called Gong Global Family. This consisted of Allen on vocals and guitar, Josh Pollock on guitar, Fabio Golfetti (of Violeta de Outono) on guitar, Gabriel Costa (also from Violeta de Outono) on bass, Marcelo Ringel on flute and tenor saxophone, and Fred Barley on drums. He also performed with his other band, University of Errors (Allen, Pollock, Barley and Michael Clare). These shows took place in São Paulo on 21 and 22 November and São Carlos on 24 November. The 21 November show was filmed and released in the UK on DVD and CD by Voiceprint Records. These musicians, minus Marcelo, also recorded some new songs at Mosh studio, São Paulo.

=== Continuing to record, tour and evolve (2008–2014) ===

In June 2008, Gong played two concerts in London, at Queen Elizabeth Hall on the South Bank (opening Massive Attack&#x27;s Meltdown festival) and at The Forum, with a line-up of Allen, Smyth, Hillage, Giraudy, Howlett, Taylor and Travis. This line-up then released a new album, &quot;2032&quot;, in 2009 and toured in support, including the Glade stage at Glastonbury Festival. They played at The Big Chill festival in the UK on 9 August 2009 with Allen, Smyth, Hillage, Giraudy, Travis, Taylor and new bassist Dave Sturt, as well as the Beautiful Days festival in Devon and the Lounge On The Farm festival near Canterbury.

Gong played four UK live shows in September 2010 with Allen, Smyth, Hillage, Giraudy, Sturt, Taylor and new wind player Ian East. Support for these shows was provided by Nik Turner&#x27;s Space Ritual.

Gong toured Europe in the fall of 2012 with the line-up of Allen, Smyth, Sturt and East, plus Orlando Allen (Acid Mothers Gong) on drums, and Fabio Golfetti (Gong Global Family) on guitar. It would be Gilli Smyth&#x27;s final tour with the band.

They played in Brazil in May 2013 and again in 2014, this time with the addition of Kavus Torabi on guitar.

The 2014 line-up released a new studio album entitled &quot;I See You&quot; on 10 November, with Gilli Smyth guesting. However, Daevid Allen had been diagnosed with a cancerous cyst in his neck and had to undergo radiation therapy followed by an extensive period of recuperation. The &quot;I See You&quot; tour went ahead without him, and the line-up of Sturt, East, Golfetti, Torabi and a &quot;mystery drummer&quot; (revealed to be Cheb Nettles) played five dates in France and two in the UK.

=== The deaths of Daevid Allen and Gilli Smyth (2015–16) ===
On 5 February 2015, Daevid Allen released a statement announcing that the cancer had returned to his neck and had also spread to his lungs, and that he was &quot;not interested in endless surgical operations&quot;, leaving him with &quot;approximately six months to live&quot;. Just over a month after the initial announcement, on 13 March 2015, Daevid&#x27;s son Orlando announced through Facebook that Allen had died in Byron Bay, Australia, aged 77.

On 11 April 2015, it was revealed that Allen had written an email to the band prior to his death, expressing his wish that the five remaining members continue performing following his passing and suggesting that Kavus Torabi become the new frontman of the band.

Gilli Smyth died on 22 August 2016, aged 83. She had been admitted to hospital in Byron Bay with pneumonia a couple of days previously.

=== Post-Daevid Allen: &quot;Rejoice! I&#x27;m Dead!&quot;, &quot;The Universe Also Collapses&quot;, &quot;Unending Ascending&quot; (2016–present) ===
On 5 July 2016, it was announced that the band line-up consisting of Kavus Torabi, Fabio Golfetti, Dave Sturt, Ian East and Cheb Nettles had recorded a new album entitled &quot;Rejoice! I&#x27;m Dead!&quot;, featuring guest appearances from Steve Hillage on guitar, Didier Malherbe on duduk and Graham Clark on violin, with Daevid Allen&#x27;s vocals appearing on two tracks. &quot;Rejoice! I&#x27;m Dead!&quot; was released on 16 September 2016 through Snapper Music.

On 10 May 2019, the lineup followed up with the album &quot;The Universe Also Collapses&quot;.

In August 2019, Universal Music announced the boxed set, &quot;Love from The Planet Gong: The Virgin Years 1973–75&quot;, encompassing Gong&#x27;s tenure with Virgin Records, would be released on 27 September. Curated by Hillage, it contains remasters of four studio albums and previously unreleased live recordings made between 1973 and 1975.

On 31 August 2023, Gong announced that they will be releasing their latest album, &quot;Unending Ascending&quot;, on 3 November 2023 through Kscope. They also premiered the video for their new single &quot;Tiny Galaxies&quot;. A second single, &quot;All Clocks Reset&quot;, was released on 5 October.

== Music and lyrics ==

=== Style and influences ===
Gong&#x27;s music fuses many influences into a distinctive style which has been variously described by critics and journalists as experimental rock, jazz fusion, jazz rock, progressive rock, psychedelic rock and space rock. Gong has also been associated with the Canterbury scene of progressive rock bands.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described Gong&#x27;s music as combining &quot;psychedelic English whimsy, German kosmische space jams and Gallic libertine fusion.&quot;

Daevid Allen&#x27;s guitar playing was influenced by Syd Barrett.

=== Mythology ===

The Gong mythology is a humorous collection of recurring characters and allegorical themes which permeate the albums of Gong and Daevid Allen, and to a lesser extent the early works of Steve Hillage. The characters were often based on, or used as pseudonyms for, band members, while the story itself was based on a vision which Allen had during the full moon of Easter 1966, in Deià, Majorca, in which he claimed he could see his future laid out before him. This mythology was hinted at through Gong&#x27;s earlier albums but was not the central theme until the &quot;Radio Gnome Invisible&quot; trilogy of 1973/74. It contains many similarities to concepts from Buddhist philosophy, e.g. optimism, the search for self, the denial of absolute reality and the search for the path to enlightenment. There are frequent references to the production and consumption of &quot;tea&quot;, perhaps suggesting mushroom tea, although the word has also long been used to describe cannabis, especially in the 1940s and 1950s. The mentioning of flying teapots was inspired by [Bertrand] Russell&#x27;s teapot.

=== Influence on other artists ===
Gong&#x27;s influence has been seen in artists such as Ozric Tentacles and Insane Clown Posse, whose member Violent J listened to Gong&#x27;s music for inspiration during the recording of ICP&#x27;s 2009 album &quot;Bang! Pow! Boom!&quot;. Gong&#x27;s music has also found fandom in the ambient music scene.

The Southern rock band Raging Slab has covered Gong&#x27;s &quot;The Pot Head Pixies&quot; for NORML&#x27;s &quot;Hempilation&quot; release. Japanese psych-rock band Acid Mothers Temple frequently covers Gong&#x27;s &quot;Master Builder&quot;, titled as &quot;Om Riff&quot;, and have released 2 full albums dedicated to album-length renditions of the song; 2005&#x27;s &quot;IAO Chant From The Cosmic Inferno&quot; and 2012&#x27;s &quot;IAO Chant From The Melting Paraiso Underground Freak Out&quot;.

Actor Sherman Hemsley, best known for his role on &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;, was an avowed Gong fanatic, going so far as to have a &quot;Flying Teapot&quot; room in his house. The room, which had darkened windows, played &quot;Flying Teapot&quot; continuously via tape loops.

<text>The Canadian Music Hall of Fame was established in 1978 by the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (CARAS) to honour Canadian musicians for their lifetime achievements in music. The award presentation is held each year as part of the Juno Award ceremonies. Since 2012, the inductee also performs at the ceremony.

A hall facility was opened in Calgary in 2016 located within The National Music Centre in Calgary, Alberta. It can be found on level five of the Studio Bell, a floor entirely dedicated to celebrating and recognizing Canadian music creators and artists who have left their mark on this country and beyond.

==Inductees==
As of 2025 CARAS has honored 70 bands or individual musicians. To date, Randy Bachman and Burton Cummings are the only artists to be inducted twice, once for their work with The Guess Who and again for Bachman&#x27;s work with Bachman–Turner Overdrive and Cummings for his solo work.

<doc id="106386" wikidata="Q207257" url="?curid=106386" title="East Lothian">
<text>East Lothian (; ; ) is one of the 32 council areas of Scotland, as well as a historic county, registration county and lieutenancy area. The county was called Haddingtonshire until 1921.

In 1975, the historic county was incorporated for local government purposes into Lothian Region as East Lothian District, with some slight alterations of its boundaries. The Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994 later created East Lothian as one of 32 modern council areas. East Lothian lies south of the Firth of Forth in the eastern central Lowlands of Scotland. It borders Edinburgh to the west, Midlothian to the south-west and the Scottish Borders to the south. Its administrative centre and former county town is Haddington while the largest town is Musselburgh.

Haddingtonshire has ancient origins and is named in a charter of 1139 as &quot;Hadintunschira&quot; and in another of 1141 as &quot;Hadintunshire&quot;. Three of the county&#x27;s towns were designated as royal burghs: Haddington, Dunbar, and North Berwick.

As with the rest of Lothian, it formed part of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Bernicia and later the Kingdom of Northumbria. Popular legend suggests that it was at a battle between the Picts and Angles in the East Lothian village of Athelstaneford in 823 that the flag of Scotland was conceived. From the 10th century, Lothian transferred from the Kingdom of England to the authority of the monarchs of Scotland. It was a cross-point in battles between England and Scotland and later the site of a significant Jacobite victory against Government forces in the Battle of Prestonpans. In the 19th century, the county is mentioned in the Gazetteer for Scotland as chiefly agricultural, with farming, fishing and coal-mining forming significant parts of the local economy.

== History ==

===Early history===

Following the end of the Roman occupation of Britain, Lothian was populated by Brythonic-speaking Ancient Britons and formed part of the kingdom of the Gododdin, within the Hen Ogledd or Old North. In the 7th century, all of the Gododdin&#x27;s territory fell to the Angles, with Lothian becoming part of the kingdom of Bernicia.

Bernicia united into the Kingdom of Northumbria which itself became part of the early Kingdom of England. Lothian came under the control of the Scottish monarchy in the 10th century.

The earliest reference to the shire of Haddington, or Haddingtonshire, occurred in the 12th century, in two charters issued by King David. The shire covered the eastern part of Lothian.

===Medieval and early modern period===
Haddingtonshire was heavily involved in several medieval and early modern conflicts and several fortified castles and buildings such as Dunbar Castle, Tantallon Castle and Dirleton Castle date from this period.

In the 12th and 13th centuries, the Palace of Haddington was one of the seats of the Kings of Scotland. King William the Lion of Scotland used the palace from time to time and it was the birthplace of Alexander II in 1198. The palace and town were burned and pillaged in 1216, by an English army under the command of King John of England. In 1296, the Battle of Dunbar was a decisive victory for the forces of Edward I of England against the forces of John Balliol, the Scottish king who was Edward&#x27;s vassal.

Haddingtonshire was also the site of conflict during the war of the Rough Wooing, with many houses and villages burnt by the English in May 1544 after the sacking of Edinburgh, the Scottish defeat at the battle of Pinkie, Dunbar Castle burnt in 1548, and the siege of Haddington. Haddingtonshire lairds supported the English cause, including John Cockburn of Ormiston, Alexander Crichton of Brunstane, and Regent Arran demolished their houses.

During the War of the Three Kingdoms, another Battle of Dunbar took place in 1650 between Scottish Covenanter forces and the English Parliamentary forces under Oliver Cromwell. The Parliamentary forces were victorious and able to march on to take Edinburgh.

Following the Restoration of the monarchy, Glorious Revolution and Acts of Union, Jacobite forces conflicted with Government forces, with the main conflict taking place as part of the 1715 Rising and 1745 Rising. Under the command of Sir John Cope, the British Army met with the Jacobites under Charles Edward Stuart at the Battle of Prestonpans in the west of the county in September 1745, with the Jacobite side gaining a significant victory before being defeated at the Battle of Culloden in April 1746.

===Modern history===

Haddingtonshire County Council was created in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, which established elected county councils across Scotland, taking over most of the functions of the Commissioners of Supply, which had been the main administrative body of the shire since 1667. The county council was based at County Buildings in Court Street, Haddington, which had been built in 1833 and also served as the county&#x27;s sheriff court.

In April 1921 the county council voted to request a change of the county&#x27;s name from Haddingtonshire to &quot;East Lothian&quot;. The government agreed and brought the change into effect as part of the East Lothian County Buildings Order Confirmation Act 1921, which received royal assent on 8 November 1921. The act also transferred ownership of the County Buildings to the county council.

In 1975 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973, Scotland&#x27;s county councils were dissolved and a new system of regional and district councils was created. East Lothian District was created within the wider Lothian region. The district comprised the historic county of East Lothian plus the burgh of Musselburgh and the parish of Inveresk (which included Wallyford and Whitecraig) from the county of Midlothian.

When further reforms in 1996 moved Scotland to a system of 32 unitary local authorities, the modern council area of East Lothian was created.

== Geography ==

To the south are the Lammermuir Hills along the boundary with Berwickshire; it is here that Meikle Says Law, the highest point in the county at , can be found. The River Tyne flows through Haddington and several of East Lothian&#x27;s villages, reaching the Firth of Forth near Belhaven.

Anyone willing to enter this competition was allowed to enter, which resulted in 623 entries to the competition; which closed on 28 February 2018. Four final flag designs were placed in a vote to the residents of East Lothian. In December 2018, the winning design was announced, designed by Archie Martin, a local man from Musselburgh and residing in Gifford who had worked for East Lothian Council for 23 years. Mr Martin died in July 2018. The flag features a saltire representing East Lothian as the birthplace of Scotland&#x27;s flag. A gold cross signifies the wealth of East Lothian&#x27;s farmlands and reputation as the granary of Scotland; with a lion in the centre representing the Haddington lion along with blue stripes to represent the rivers Esk and Tyne.

===Local media===
East Lothian is served by a local paid-for weekly newspapers, the &quot;East Lothian Courier&quot;.

The &quot;East Lothian Courier&quot; (known locally as &quot;The Courier&quot;) began as the Haddingtonshire Courier in 1859, before changing its name in 1971. It was owned by D&amp;J Croal, based in Haddington, until its purchase by the Dunfermline Press Group in 2004. It is now owned by Newsquest.

The &quot;East Lothian News&quot; was first published in 1971, as part of Scottish County Press Group, with editorial offices in Dalkeith and printing at Bonnyrigg (both in Midlothian). The Scottish County Press Group was acquired by Regional Independent Media in 2000, which was in turn bought by Johnston Press in 2002. The &quot;East Lothian News&quot; closed in 2015.

<text>The United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism (USCJ) is the major congregational organization of Conservative Judaism in North America, and the largest Conservative Jewish communal body in the world. USCJ closely works with the Rabbinical Assembly, the international body of Conservative rabbis. It coordinates and assists the activities of its member communities on all levels.

== History ==
Representatives of twenty-two Jewish congregations in North America met at the Jewish Theological Seminary on 23 February 1913. The representatives formed the United Synagogue of America to develop and perpetuate Conservative Judaism. The group elected Rabbi Solomon Schechter the first president.

At its executive council&#x27;s April 1913 meeting, the organization&#x27;s purpose was defined as loyalty to the Torah; to promote observance of Shabbat and Jewish dietary laws; to preserve Israel&#x27;s past and promote its restoration; to maintain traditional Jewish prayer in Hebrew; to promote traditional Judaism in the home; and to encourage the establishment of Jewish religious schools whose instruction includes the study of the Hebrew language and its literature as a bond that unites Jewish people worldwide.

The name of the organization was changed to the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism in 1991.

==Role and description==

United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism has 572 affiliated congregations .

==Programs==
USCJ sponsors the following programs:
* United Synagogue Youth (USY) is the youth movement of USCJ. The organization&#x27;s mission is to empower Jewish youth to develop friendships, leadership skills, a sense of belonging to the Jewish People, a deep engagement with and love for Israel, and a commitment to inspired Jewish living through meaningful and fun experiences based on the ideology of Conservative Judaism.
* Nativ is USCJ&#x27;s academic gap year program in Israel for in-bound college freshmen.
* The Conservative Yeshiva in Jerusalem is USCJ&#x27;s learning community in Israel.

<doc id="106392" wikidata="Q2903240" url="?curid=106392" title="Louis Finkelstein">
<text>Louis Finkelstein (June 14, 1895, in Cincinnati, Ohio – 29 November 1991) was a Talmud scholar, an expert in Jewish law, and a leader of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTS) and Conservative Judaism.

==Biography==
Louis (Eliezer) Finkelstein was born into a rabbinic family in Cincinnati on June 14, 1895. He moved with his parents to Brooklyn, New York as a youngster and graduated from the City College of New York in 1915. He received his PhD from Columbia University in 1918 and was ordained at the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTS) the following year. He joined the JTS faculty in 1920 as an instructor in Talmud and went on to serve as an associate professor and professor of theology. He later became provost, president, chancellor and chancellor emeritus.

==Chancellorship at JTS==
Finkelstein was appointed chancellor of JTS in 1940 and remained chancellor until 1972. He positioned JTS as the central institution of Conservative Judaism, which experienced extraordinary growth during those years. Thousands of Jews living in America&#x27;s cities moved to the suburbs and joined and built Conservative synagogues, and the movement emerged as the branch of Judaism with the largest number of synagogues and members. Finkelstein&#x27;s leadership led Ari L. Goldman, in his obituary for Finkelstein in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, to describe Finkelstein as &quot;the dominant leader of Conservative Judaism in the 20th century.&quot;
During Finkelstein&#x27;s leadership, the seminary flourished, growing from a small rabbinical school and teacher training program to a major university of Judaism. Finkelstein also established the seminary&#x27;s Cantor&#x27;s Institute, the Seminary College of Jewish Music, the Institute for Advanced Studies in the Humanities (predecessor of the Graduate School), and a West Coast branch of the seminary that later became the University of Judaism (now the American Jewish University).

In a personal conversation, Finkelstein called the Conservative movement &quot;a gimmick to get Jews back to real Judaism.&quot; His personal problems with the movement were reflected in his practice of coming to Conservative synagogues after having already prayed morning prayers, apparently regarding the synagogues&#x27; liturgical practices to be religiously flawed.

Public outreach was among Finkelstein&#x27;s top priorities. One of his signature programs was a radio and television show called The Eternal Light, which explored Judaism and Jewish holidays. Interfaith dialogue was a particular priority. Finkelstein established the Institute for Religious and Social Studies, which brought together Protestant, Roman Catholic and Jewish scholars for theological discussions. His efforts were considered so significant that an article about him was featured in &quot;Time Magazine&quot; including his picture on its cover on the edition of October 13, 1951. In 1986, the institute&#x27;s name was changed to the Finkelstein Institute in his honor.

Finkelstein&#x27;s contacts went well beyond the religious community. He was intimate with leading political and judicial figures and, in 1957, enticed Chief Justice Earl Warren of the United States Supreme Court to spend a Sabbath at the seminary studying the Talmud. Finkelstein served as the official Jewish representative to President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s commission on peace, and, in 1963, President John F. Kennedy sent him to Rome as part of an American delegation to the installation of Pope Paul VI. He also offered a prayer at the second inauguration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

==Scholarship==
Even at his busiest, Finkelstein left time for scholarship. Friends said he rose every morning at 4 A.M. to study and write until he went to synagogue at 7 A.M. He was the author or editor of more than 100 books, both scholarly and popular. He described the major influences upon his scholarship as Rabbi Professors Solomon Schechter, Louis Ginzburg, Alexander Marx and Saul Lieberman.

Finkelstein authored a number of books, including &quot;Tradition in the Making, Beliefs and Practices of Judaism&quot;, &quot;Pre-Maccabean Documents in the Passover Haggadah&quot;, &quot;Introduction to the Treatises Abot and Abot of Rabbi Nathan&quot; (1950, in Hebrew with English summary), &quot;Abot of Rabbi Nathan&quot;, (a three volume series on the Pharisees), and &quot;Akiba: Scholar, Saint and Martyr&quot;. He also edited a four volume series entitled &quot;The Jews: Their History, Culture and Religion&quot; in 1949; in 1971, it was renamed and published as three volumes, &quot;The Jews: Their History&quot;; &quot;The Jews: Their Religion and Culture;&quot; and &quot;The Jews:&quot; &quot;Their Role in Civilization&quot;. Among his other works were &quot;New Light from the Prophets,&quot; published in 1969.

His major scholarly pursuits were works on the Pharisees, a Jewish sect in second Temple times from which modern Jewish tradition developed, and the Sifra, the oldest rabbinic commentary on the book of Leviticus, which was completed in Palestine in the fifth century. Even in his retirement he continued writing, working at the dining room table of his Riverside Drive apartment to complete several annotated volumes of the Sifra.

When he became frail in his later years and had trouble walking to the synagogue, his former students turned his home into a synagogue on Saturday mornings, assembling the quorum of 10 needed for prayer. After his death in 1991 this group evolved into Kehilat Orach Eliezer (KOE), which means &quot;Congregation of the Way of Eliezer&quot; (Eliezer Aryeh was Louis Finkelstein&#x27;s given name in Hebrew), and became notable for being a large halakhic congregation that nevertheless strives to accommodate women&#x27;s participation in public prayer services as much as possible within the parameters established by Jewish law as the group understands it. It meets on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper West Side. After Finkelstein&#x27;s death, Rabbi Professor David Weiss Halivni served as rabbi of the congregation until emigrating to Israel in 2005.

<doc id="106393" wikidata="Q152308" url="?curid=106393" title="Queen Silvia of Sweden">
<text>Silvia (born Silvia Renate Sommerlath; 23 December 1943) is Queen of Sweden as the wife of King Carl XVI Gustaf. She has held this title since her marriage to Carl Gustaf in 1976. The king and queen have three children: Crown Princess Victoria, Prince Carl Philip, and Princess Madeleine.

==Childhood and parentage==

Silvia Renate Sommerlath was born in Heidelberg, Germany, on 23 December 1943, the only daughter of Alice (née Soares de Toledo) and Walther Sommerlath. Her father was German and her mother Brazilian.

She has one older brother, Ralf Sommerlath (born 1929). Her other brothers were Walther Sommerlath, who died in 2020, and Jörg Sommerlath, who died in 2006. The Mother-Child House Jörg Sommerlath in Berlin, operated by Queen Silvia&#x27;s World Childhood Foundation, is named after her brother.

She attended grammar school in Düsseldorf, finishing her Abitur in 1963; and attended the Munich School of Interpreting from 1965 to 1969, majoring in Spanish.

She has some fluency in Swedish Sign Language, a national sign language used by the deaf community in Sweden. She is a trained interpreter and Swedish is her sixth language. She speaks her native German, her mother&#x27;s language of Portuguese, as well as French, Spanish, and English.

==Marriage and family ==
During the 1972 Summer Olympics, Sommerlath met Crown Prince Carl Gustaf. At the time, she was leading a marketing campaign for the city of Munich. Sommerlath and the other Olympic hostesses wore sky-blue dirndls to promote Bavarian cultural identity. After the death of King Gustaf VI Adolf on 15 September 1973, Carl XVI Gustaf succeeded to the throne.

He and Sommerlath announced their engagement on 12 March 1976 and were married three months later on 19 June 1976 in Stockholm Cathedral. It was the first marriage of a reigning Swedish monarch since 1797. The wedding was preceded the evening before by a Royal Variety Performance, where the Swedish musical group ABBA performed &quot;Dancing Queen&quot; for the first time as a tribute to Sweden&#x27;s future queen.

The King and Queen have three children and nine grandchildren:
*Crown Princess Victoria, Duchess of Västergötland (born 14 July 1977), who is married to Daniel Westling and has two children
*Prince Carl Philip, Duke of Värmland (born 13 May 1979), who is married to Sofia Hellqvist and has four children
*Princess Madeleine, Duchess of Hälsingland and Gästrikland, (born 10 June 1982), who is married to Christopher O&#x27;Neill and has three children 

In February 2021, Silvia was taken to hospital after she fractured her right wrist in a fall.

==Father&#x27;s Nazi links==

In July 2002, the Queen became the subject of international curiosity when an article published in the syndicalist newspaper &quot;Arbetaren&quot; reported that German state archives recorded that the Queen&#x27;s father, Walther Sommerlath, joined the Nazi party&#x27;s foreign wing, the NSDAP/AO, in 1934, when he was living in Brazil and working for a German steel company. In December 2010, Queen Silvia wrote a letter of complaint to Jan Scherman, the CEO of TV4, the network that had aired a documentary about her father&#x27;s alleged Nazi past.

Queen Silvia commissioned a report from World War II expert Erik Norberg, a choice that was criticised due to Norberg having ties to the royal family. In his report, Norberg said that the Queen&#x27;s father had in fact helped the owner of the steel-fabrication plant, a Jewish businessperson, escape from Germany by taking over the factory. In a December 2011 interview for Sweden&#x27;s public service broadcaster Sveriges Television, Silvia called the media&#x27;s handling of the information about her father &quot;character assassination&quot;.

==Charity involvement==

Queen Silvia established Mentor International in 1994 in collaboration with the World Health Organization. Her vision was to offer mentoring as inspiration, empowerment, and motivation for young people to make healthy life choices and view their futures more positively. Mentor&#x27;s work has been recognized by the United Nations Office on Drugs &amp; Crime, the Organization of American States, and the Council of Europe. She is now an honorary board member of Mentor Foundation.

She was also a co-founder of the World Childhood Foundation in 1999, having been inspired by her work as Patron of the first World Congress against Commercial Sexual Exploitation of Children held in Stockholm. She has also been involved in the Global Child Forum, which she helped initiate, as a keynote speaker in several forums.

Her commitment to the work with dementia and the care of the elderly at the end of life is also well known and respected. On her initiative, Silviahemmet was established in Stockholm. It works to educate hospital personnel in how to work with people suffering from dementia, and also initiates research in the area. 

She chairs the Royal Wedding Fund, which supports research in sports and athletics for disabled young people and the Queen Silvia Jubilee Fund for research on children and disability.

Queen Silvia holds honorary positions in the Swedish Amateur Athletic Association, the Children&#x27;s Cancer Foundation of Sweden and Save the Children Sweden.

<text>George Humphrey Tichenor (April 12, 1837January 14, 1923) was a Kentucky-born physician who introduced antiseptic surgery while in the service of the Confederate States of America. Thereafter, in private practice in Canton (Madison County), Mississippi, he developed the formula that became &quot;Dr. Tichenor&#x27;s Antiseptic.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Tichenor was born in Ohio County in western Kentucky to Rolla Tichenor and the former Elizabeth Hymphrey. He was educated in private schools.

==Career==
Initially, Tichenor was a businessman in Franklin (Williamson County), Tennessee, when the American Civil War began. After the American Civil War had begun, in 1861, he entered military service with the 22nd Tennessee Cavalry Regiment.

In 1863, he became an enrolling Confederate officer, and thereafter an assistant surgeon, during which time he is believed to have been the first in the Confederacy to have used antiseptic surgery. Tichenor experimented with the use of alcohol as an antiseptic on wounds. He was badly wounded in the leg in 1863, and amputation was recommended. He insisted on treating his wounds with an alcohol-based solution of his own devising. His wound healed, and he regained the use of his leg.

His potential reputation as a humanitarian was clouded by his fierce regional loyalty; Tichenor insisted that his techniques be used only on injured Confederates, never on Union prisoners.

An unconfirmed story was later circulated that Dr. Tichenor&#x27;s antiseptic was granted the first patent issued by the Confederate government. An image of the Confederate Battle Flag remained on the product label well into the 20th century.
Tichenor developed his antiseptic formula in Canton, Mississippi, and thereafter practiced medicine in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, from 1869 to 1887. He started bottling &quot;Dr. Tichenor&#x27;s Patent Medicine&quot; in New Orleans; the formula, consisting of alcohol, oil of peppermint, and arnica, was originally marketed as useful for a wide variety of complaints for both internal and external use for man and animal. A patent was registered in 1882. The company producing this liquid was incorporated in 1905 and is still in existence, though the recommended uses are now more modest: principally as a mouthwash and topical antiseptic.

==Personal life==
Tichenor married the former Margaret A. Drane of Kentucky while they were in Canton. They had three sons: Rolla A. Tichenor, George H. Tichenor Jr., and Elmore Drane Tichenor. He was a member of the Masonic Lodge and the Baptist Church. He was adjutant general and commander of the Louisiana division of the United Confederate Veterans.

He is interred in Roselawn Memorial Park in Baton Rouge, La.

<text>Wynonie Harris (August 24, 1915 – June 14, 1969) was an American blues shouter best remembered as a singer of upbeat songs, featuring humorous, often ribald lyrics. He had fifteen Top 10 hits between 1946 and 1952. Harris is attributed by many music scholars to be one of the founding fathers of rock and roll. His &quot;Good Rocking Tonight&quot; is mentioned at least as a precursor to rock and roll.

His dirty blues repertoire included &quot;Lolly Pop Mama&quot; (1948), &quot;I Like My Baby&#x27;s Pudding&quot; (1950), &quot;Sittin on It All the Time&quot; (1950), &quot;Keep On Churnin&#x27; (Till the Butter Comes)&quot; (1952), and &quot;Wasn&#x27;t That Good&quot; (1953).

==Biography==
===Early life and family===
Harris&#x27;s mother, Mallie Hood Anderson, was fifteen and unmarried at the time of his birth. His paternity is uncertain. His wife, Olive E. Goodlow, and daughter, Patricia Vest, said that his father was a Native American named Blue Jay. Wynonie had no father figure in his family until 1920, when his mother married Luther Harris, fifteen years her senior.

In 1931, at age 16, Harris dropped out of high school in North Omaha. The following year, his first child, a daughter, Micky, was born to Naomi Henderson. Ten months later his son, Wesley, was born to Laura Devereaux. Both children were raised by their mothers. Wesley became a singer in the Five Echoes and in The Sultans, and later was a singer and guitarist in Preston Love&#x27;s band.

In 1935 Harris, age 20, started dating 16-year-old Olive E. (Ollie) Goodlow, of Council Bluffs, Iowa, who came to neighboring Omaha to watch him perform. On May 20, 1936, Ollie gave birth to a daughter, Adrianne Patricia (Pattie). Harris and Ollie were married on December 11, 1936. Later they lived in the Logan Fontenelle projects in North Omaha. Ollie worked as a barmaid and nurse; Harris sang in clubs and took odd jobs. His mother was Pattie&#x27;s main caretaker. In 1940, Wynonie and Ollie Harris moved to Los Angeles, California, leaving Pattie with her grandmother in Omaha.

==Early career==
Harris formed a dance team with Velda Shannon in the early 1930s. They performed in North Omaha&#x27;s flourishing entertainment community, and by 1934, were a regular attraction at the Ritz Theatre. In 1935, Harris, having become a celebrity in Omaha, was able to earn a living as an entertainer, in the depths of the Great Depression.

While performing at Jim Bell&#x27;s Club Harlem nightclub with Shannon, he began to sing the blues. He began traveling frequently to Kansas City, where he paid close attention to blues shouters, including Jimmy Rushing and Big Joe Turner. His break in Los Angeles was at a nightclub owned by Curtis Mosby. It was here that Harris became known as &quot;Mr. Blues&quot;.

==With Lucky Millinder==
During the 1942–44 musicians&#x27; strike, Harris was unable to pursue a recording career, relying instead on personal appearances. Performing almost continuously, in late 1943 he appeared at the Rhumboogie Club in Chicago. He was spotted by Lucky Millinder, who asked him to join his band on tour. Harris joined on March 24, 1944, when the band was in the middle of a week-long residency at the Regal in Chicago.

They moved on to New York City, where on April 7 Harris took the stage with Millinder&#x27;s band for his debut at the Apollo Theatre, in Harlem. It was during this performance that Harris first publicly performed &quot;Who Threw the Whiskey in the Well&quot; (a song recorded two years earlier by Doc Wheeler&#x27;s Sunset Orchestra).

After the band&#x27;s stint at the Apollo, they moved on to their regular residency at the Savoy Ballroom, also in Harlem. Here, Preston Love, Harris&#x27;s childhood friend, joined Millinder&#x27;s band, replacing the alto saxophonist Tab Smith. On May 26, 1944, Harris made his recording debut with Lucky Millinder and His Orchestra. Entering a recording studio for the first time, Harris sang on two of the five cuts recorded that day, &quot;Hurry, Hurry&quot; and &quot;Who Threw the Whiskey in the Well&quot;, for Decca Records. The embargo on shellac during World War II had not yet been rescinded, and release of the record was delayed.

Harris&#x27;s success and popularity grew as Millinder&#x27;s band toured the country, but he and Millinder had a falling out over money, and in September 1945, while playing in San Antonio, Texas, Harris quit the band. Three weeks later, upon hearing of Harris&#x27;s separation from the band, a Houston promoter refused to allow Millinder&#x27;s band to perform. Millinder called Harris and agreed to pay his asking price of one hundred dollars a night. The promoter reinstated the booking, but it was the final time Harris and Millinder worked together. Bull Moose Jackson replaced Harris as the vocalist in the band.

In April 1945, a year after the song was recorded, Decca released &quot;Who Threw the Whiskey in the Well&quot;. It became the group&#x27;s biggest hit, reaching number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart on July 14 and staying there for eight weeks. The song remained on the charts for almost five months, also becoming popular with white audiences.

In California the success of the song opened doors for Harris. Since the contract with Decca was with Millinder, Harris was a free agent and could choose from the recording contracts with which he was presented.

==Solo career==
In July 1945, Harris signed with Philo, a label owned by the brothers Leo and Edward Mesner. Harris&#x27; band was assembled by Johnny Otis, and the group recorded the 78-rpm record &quot;Around the Clock&quot;. Although not a chart-topper, the song became popular, and cover versions were recorded by many artists, including Willie Bryant, Jimmy Rushing and Big Joe Turner.

Harris went on to record sessions for other labels, including Apollo, Bullet and Aladdin. His greatest success came when he signed for Syd Nathan&#x27;s King label, where he enjoyed a series of hits on the U.S. R&amp;B chart in the late 1940s and early 1950s. These included a 1948 cover of Roy Brown&#x27;s &quot;Good Rocking Tonight&quot;, &quot;Good Morning Judge&quot; and &quot;All She Wants to Do Is Rock&quot;. In 1946, Harris recorded two singles with the pianist Herman &quot;Sonny&quot; Blount, who later earned fame as the eclectic jazz composer and bandleader Sun Ra.

Some reviewers state that &quot;Good Rocking Tonight&quot;, by Roy Brown (1947) or by Harris (1948) is one of the contenders for the title of &quot;first rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll record&quot;. The label of the 45 RPM record by Brown included the words &quot;Rocking blues&quot;. According to the Paul McCartney Project, &quot;Harris&#x27;s version was even more energetic than Brown&#x27;s original version, featuring black gospel style handclapping&quot;. The Project adds that &quot;the song has also been credited with being the most successful record to that point to use the word &#x27;rock&#x27; not as a euphemism for sex, but as a descriptive for the musical style.

In 1950, Harris released the double-sided hit &quot;Sittin&#x27; on It All the Time&quot; backed with &quot;Baby, Shame on You&quot; (King 4330), and in 1951, he recorded a cover version of Hank Penny&#x27;s &quot;Bloodshot Eyes&quot; (King 4461). His risqué approach to material at times made his tracks &quot;Keep On Churnin&#x27;&quot; (1952) and &quot;Wasn&#x27;t That Good&quot; (1953) jukebox favorites in the early 1950s. Other lascivious songs he recorded include the earlier tracks &quot;I Want My Fanny Brown&quot; and &quot;Lollipop Mama&quot;.

Harris definitely achieved a great deal of success, with &quot;16 Top 10 R&amp;B hits between 1945 and 1952, including the definitive version of Roy Brown&#x27;s &quot;Good Rockin&#x27; Tonight,&quot; a disc that spent 25 weeks on Billboard&#x27;s chart in 1948&quot;.

&#x27; Lovin&#x27; Machine &#x27;, (1952), and &#x27; The Deacon don&#x27;t like it &#x27;, (1953), both mention Hadacol whiskey.

==Later career==
Harris transitioned between several recording contracts between 1954 and 1964. In 1960 he cut six sides for Roulette Records, including a remake of his hit &quot;Bloodshot Eyes&quot; and &quot;Sweet Lucy Brown&quot;, &quot;Spread the News&quot;, &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, &quot;Josephine&quot; and &quot;Did You Get the Message&quot;. He also became more indebted and was forced to live in less glamorous surroundings.

In 1964 Harris resettled for the last time in Los Angeles. His final recordings were three sides for Chess Records in 1964: &quot;The Comeback&quot;, &quot;Buzzard Luck&quot; and &quot;Conjured&quot;. His final large-scale performance was at the Apollo in November 1967, where he performed with Big Joe Turner, Big Mama Thornton, Jimmy Witherspoon and T-Bone Walker.

==Death==
Harris died of esophageal cancer on June 14, 1969, aged 53, at the USC Medical Center Hospital in Los Angeles.

==Legacy==
He was the subject of a 1994 biography by Tony Collins.

Since the end of the twentieth century, there has been a resurgence of interest in his music. Some of his recordings are being reissued, and he has been honored posthumously.
* 1994: Inducted into the W. C. Handy Blues Hall of Fame by the Blues Foundation in Memphis, Tennessee
* 1998: Inducted into the Nebraska Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Lincoln
* 2000: Inducted into the High School Hall of Fame at Central High School in Omaha, Nebraska
* 2005: Inducted into the Omaha Black Music Hall of Fame

In 2011, Harris&#x27;s song &quot;Quiet Whiskey&quot; was number 9 the list of Top 10 Drinking Songs published by AskMen.com.

In 2014, Harris&#x27;s song &quot;Grandma Plays the Numbers&quot; was featured in the video game &quot;Fallout 4&quot;.

The Blues Hall of Fame provides these comments: &quot;Harris recorded sporadically afterwards [after 1952] but never again enjoyed the glory or success he&#x27;d known as one of the kings of jump blues. Today he is most acknowledged for laying the groundwork for rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;.

===Influence on Elvis Presley===
Elvis Presley may well have seen Harris perform in Memphis in the early 1950s, although this is not documented. According to Henry Glover, Harris&#x27;s record producer, Elvis &quot;copied many of the vocal gymnastics of Wynonie as well as the physical gyrations. When you saw Elvis, you were seeing a mild version of Wynonie&quot;. Harris remarked in a 1956 interview that Elvis&#x27;s hip movements were stirring controversy in a way his own never did: &quot;Many people have been giving him trouble for swinging his hips. I swing mine and have no trouble. He&#x27;s got publicity I could not buy&quot;.

In the television miniseries of 2005, &quot;Elvis&quot;, Harris was played by Marcus Lyle Brown.

<doc id="106402" wikidata="Q339452" url="?curid=106402" title="Genocide denial">
<text>Genocide denial is the attempt to deny or minimize the scale and severity of an instance of genocide. Denial is an integral part of genocide and includes the secret planning of genocide, propaganda while the genocide is going on, and destruction of evidence of mass killings. According to genocide researcher Gregory Stanton, denial &quot;is among the surest indicators of further genocidal massacres&quot;.

Some scholars define denial as the final stage of a genocidal process. Richard G. Hovannisian states, &quot;Complete annihilation of a people requires the banishment of recollection and suffocation of remembrance. Falsification, deception and half-truths reduce what was, to what might have been or perhaps what was not at all.&quot;

Examples include: Holodomor denial, Armenian genocide denial, denial of genocides of Indigenous peoples, Holocaust denial, Cambodian genocide denial, Bosnian genocide denial, Rohingya genocide denial, Rwandan genocide denial, Uyghur genocide denial. The distinction between respectable academic historians and illegitimate historical negationists and revisionists, including genocide deniers, rests upon the techniques which are used in the writing of such histories. Historical revisionists and negationists rewrite history in order to support an agenda, which is usually political or ideological, by using falsification and rhetorical fallacies in order to obtain their desired results. Exposure of genocide denial and revisionism surged in the early 21st century, facilitated by the propagation of conspiracy theories and hate speech on social media.

==Analysis==
According to Taner Akçam, &quot;the practice of &#x27;denialism&#x27; in regard to mass atrocities is usually thought of as a simple denial of the facts, but this is not true. Rather, it is in that nebulous territory between facts and truth where such denialism germinates.&quot;

David Tolbert, president of the International Center for Transitional Justice, states:
=== Motives and strategies ===
Some of the main reasons for denying genocide are to evade moral or even criminal responsibility and to protect the perpetrators&#x27; reputation.

Gregory Stanton outlines the tactics of genocide denial including: questioning the statistics, denial of intent, definitional debates, and blaming the victims. Genocide scholar Israel Charny outlines five psychological characteristics of denials of genocide.

Genocide scholar Adam Jones proposed a framework for genocide denial that consists of several strategies, including minimizing fatalities, blaming fatalities on unrelated &quot;natural&quot; causes, denying intent to destroy a group, and claiming self-defense in preemptive or disproportionate attacks:

* &quot;&quot;Hardly anybody died&quot; When the genocides lie far in the past, denial is easier.
* &quot;It wasn&#x27;t intentional&quot; Disease and famine-causing conditions such as forced labor, concentration camps and slavery (even though they may be manufactured by the perpetrator) may be blamed for casualties.
* &quot;There weren&#x27;t that many people to begin with&quot; Minimizing the casualties of the victims, while the criminals destroy or hide the evidence.
* &quot;It was self defense&quot; The killing of civilians, especially able bodied males is rationalized in preemptive attack, as they are accused of plotting against the perpetrators. The perpetrator may exterminate witnesses and relatives of the victims.
* &quot;There was no central direction&quot; Perpetrators can use militias, paramilitaries, mercenaries, or death squads to avoid being seen as directly participating.
* &quot;It wasn&#x27;t or isn&#x27;t &#x27;genocide,&#x27; because ...&quot; They may enter definitional or rhetorical argumentation.
* &quot;We would never do that&quot; Self-image cannot be questioned: the perpetrator sees itself as benevolent by definition. Evidence doesn&#x27;t matter.
* &quot;We are the real victims&quot;&quot; They deflect attention to their own casualties/losses, without historical context.

==By individuals and non-governmental organizations==
* In his 1984 book &quot;The Other Side: The Secret Relationship Between Nazism and Zionism&quot; Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas argued that only &quot;a few hundred thousand&quot; Jews were murdered in the Holocaust, the Jews brought the Holocaust upon themselves because of their behavior, and Zionists had collaborated with the Nazis in an attempt to send more Jews to Israel. In a 2006 interview, without retracting these specific claims, he stated: &quot;The Holocaust was a terrible, unforgivable crime against the Jewish nation, a crime against humanity that cannot be accepted by humankind.&quot;
* In February 2006 David Irving was imprisoned in Austria for Holocaust denial; he served 13 months in prison before being released on probation.
* David Campbell has written of the now defunct British magazine &quot;Living Marxism&quot; that &quot;LM&#x27;s intentions are clear from the way they have sought to publicize accounts of contemporary atrocities which suggest they were certainly not genocidal (as in the case of Rwanda), and perhaps did not even occur (as in the case of the murder of nearly 8,000 at Srebrenica).&quot; Chris McGreal writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; on 20 March 2000 stated that Fiona Fox writing under a pseudonym had contributed an article to &quot;Living Marxism&quot; which was part of a campaign by &quot;Living Marxism&quot; that denied that the event which occurred in Rwanda was a genocide.
* Scott Jaschik has stated that Justin McCarthy, is one of two scholars &quot;most active on promoting the view that no Armenian genocide took place&quot;. He was one of four scholars who participated in a controversial debate hosted by PBS about the genocide.
* Darko Trifunovic is the author of the &quot;Report about Case Srebrenica&quot;, which was commissioned by the government of the Republika Srpska. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) reviewed the report and concluded that it &quot;represented one of the worst examples of revisionism, in relation to the mass executions of Bosniaks committed in Srebrenica in July 1995&quot;. After the report was published on 3 September 2002, it provoked outrage and condemnation by a wide variety of Balkans and international figures, individuals, and organizations.

==By governments==


=== Australia ===

The Australian government has been criticized for engaging in genocide denial and historic revisionism, concerning the treatment of Indigenous people. Prominent Australian politicians have refused to acknowledge the genocide.

=== Canada ===
=== Croatia ===
=== India ===
=== Japan ===

In Japan, interpretation of the Nanjing Massacre is reflected upon the notions of &quot;pride, honor and shame&quot;. Takashi Yoshida describes the Japanese debate over the Nanjing Massacre as &quot;crystalliz[ing] a much larger conflict over what should constitute the ideal perception of the nation: Japan, as a nation, acknowledges its past and apologizes for its wartime wrongdoings; or ... stands firm against foreign pressures and teaches Japanese youth about the benevolent and courageous martyrs who fought a just war to save Asia from Western aggression.&quot; In some nationalist circles in Japan, speaking of a large-scale massacre at Nanjing is regarded as Japan bashing&#x27; (in the case of foreigners) or &#x27;self-flagellation&#x27; (in the case of Japanese)&quot;. This means that most Japanese youth are oblivious of the massacre because this dark history is not taught in Japanese schools, and the continued worship of Japanese war criminals enshrined in the Yasukuni Shrine by mainstream politicians in Japan.

=== Pakistan ===
The government of Pakistan continues to deny that any Bangladeshi genocide took place during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971. They typically accuse Pakistani reporters (such as Anthony Mascarenhas), who reported on the genocide, of being &quot;enemy agents&quot;. According to Donald W. Beachler, professor of political science at Ithaca College:

Similarly, in the wake of the 2013 Shahbag protests against war criminals who were complicit in the genocide, English journalist Philip Hensher wrote:
=== Russia ===
=== Serbia ===

According to Sonja Biserko, president of the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia, and Edina Becirevic, the faculty of criminology and security studies of the University of Sarajevo:
=== Turkey ===

The government of the Republic of Turkey has long denied that the Armenian genocide was a genocide. According to Akçam, &quot;Turkish denialism [of the genocide] is perhaps the most successful example of how the well-organised, deliberate, and systematic spreading of falsehoods can play an important role in the field of public debate&quot; and that &quot;fact-based truths have been discredited and relegated to the status of mere opinion&quot;. Turkey acknowledges that many Armenians residing in the Ottoman Empire were killed in conflicts with Ottoman forces during World War One, but disputes the statistics and claims that the killings were systematic and amounted to genocide.Measures recognising the Armenian genocide have languished in the US Congress for decades, and US presidents have refrained from labelling it such due to worries about relations with Turkey and intensive lobbying by Ankara.

=== United States ===
The government of the United States has been accused of denial of the genocide of its Indigenous peoples by academics such as Benjamin Madley, David Stannard and Noam Chomsky.

== Law ==
The European Commission proposed a European Union–wide anti-racism law in 2001, which included an offence of genocide denial, but European Union states failed to agree on the balance between prohibiting racism and freedom of expression. After six years of debating, a watered down compromise was reached in 2007 which gave EU states freedom to implement the legislation as they saw fit.

In 2022, the United Nations Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect issued a policy paper associating genocide denial with hate speech, specifically when directed to specific identifiable groups. The report gives policy recommendations for states and UN officials in the matter of denial.

== Effects ==

Genocide denial has an impact on both victim and perpetrator groups. Denial of a genocide affects relations between the victim and perpetrator groups or their respective countries, prevents personal victims of the genocide from seeking closure, and adversely affects political decisions on both sides. It can cause fear in the victims to express their cultural identity, retaliation from both parties, and hamper the democratic development of societies.

Effects on personal victims of the genocide

While confrontation of the committed atrocities can be a tough process in which the victim feels humiliated again by reliving the traumatic past, it still has a benign therapeutic effect, helping both victim and perpetrator groups to come to terms with the past. From a therapeutic point of view, letting the victim confront the past atrocity and its related painful memories is one way to reach a closure and to understand that the harm has occurred in the past. This also helps the memories to enter the shared narrative of the society, thereby becoming a common ground on which the society can make future decisions on, in political and cultural matters.

Denying recognition, in contrast, has a negative effect, further victimising the victim which will feel not only wronged by the perpetrator but also by being denied recognition of the occurred wrongdoing. Denial also has a pivotal role in shaping the norms of a society since the omission of any committed errors, and thereby the lack of condemnation and punishment of the committed wrongs, risks normalising similar actions, increasing the society&#x27;s tolerance for future occurrences of similar errors.

According to sociologist Daniel Feierstein, the genocide perpetrator implements a process of transforming the identity of any survivors and erasing the memory of the existence of the victim group.

Societal effects of genocide denial

Bhargava notes that &quot;[m]ost calls to forget disguise the attempt to prevent victims from publicly remembering in the fear that &#x27;there is a dragon living on the patio and we better not provoke it.&#x27;&quot; In other words, while societally &quot;forgetting&quot; an atrocity can on the surface be beneficial to the harmony of society, it further victimizes the target group for fear of future, similar action, and is directly detrimental to the sociocultural development of the victim group.

On the other hand, there are cases where &quot;forgetting&quot; atrocities is the most politically expedient or stable option. This is found in some states which have recently come out of minority rule, where the perpetrator group still controls most strategic resources and institutions, such as South Africa. This was, among others, one of the main reasons for granting amnesty in exchange for confessing to committed errors during the transitional period in South Africa. However, the society at large and the victims in particular will perceive this kind of trade-offs as &quot;morally suspect,&quot; and may question its sustainability. Thus, a common refrain in regard to the Final Report (1998) by South Africa&#x27;s Truth and Reconciliation Commission was &quot;We&#x27;ve heard the truth. There is even talk about reconciliation. But where&#x27;s the justice?&quot;

Effects on democratic development

The denial has thereby a direct negative impact on the development of a society, often by undermining its laws and the issue of justice, but also the level of democracy itself. If democracy is meant to be built on the rule of law and justice, upheld and safeguarded by state institutions, then surely the omission of legal consequences and justice would potentially undermine the democracy. What is more dangerous from a historical point of view is that such a default would imply the subsequent loss of the meaning of these events to future generations, a loss which is resembled to &quot;losing a moral compass.&quot; The society becomes susceptible to similar wrongdoings in the absence of proper handling of preceding occasions. Nonetheless, denial, especially immediately after the committed wrongdoings, is rather the rule than the exception and naturally almost exclusively done by the perpetrator to escape responsibility.

Implicit denial of genocide

While some societies or governments openly deny genocide, in some other cases, e.g. in the case of the &quot;Comfort women&quot; and the role of the Japanese State, the denial is more implicit. This was evident in how an overwhelmingly majority of the surviving victims refused to accept a monetary compensation since the Japanese government still refused to admit its own responsibility (the monetary compensation was paid through a private fund rather than by the state, a decision perceived by the victims about state&#x27;s refusal to assume any direct responsibility). This can have the same effects on societies as outright denial. For example, atrocity denial and self-victimisation in Japanese historical textbooks has caused much diplomatic tension between Japan and neighbouring victim states, such as Korea and China, and bolstered domestic conservative or nationalist forces.

Turkey and Armenian genocide denial
The Turkish state&#x27;s Armenian genocide denial has had far-reaching effects on the Turkish society throughout its history in regard to both ethnic minorities, especially the Kurds, but political opposition in general. The denial also affects Turks, in that there is a lack of recognition of Turks and Ottoman officials who attempted to stop the genocide. This lack of recognition of the various actors at play in Turkey could result in a rather homogeneous perception of the nation in question, thus making Armenians (but also third parties) project the perpetrating role onto the entire Turkish society and nation, causing further racial strife and aggravating the prospects of future reconciliation. For example, Armenian terrorist groups (e.g. ASALA and JCAG) committed terrorist acts during 1970&#x27;s and 1980&#x27;s as a direct result of the Turkish state denial of the genocide.

=== Prevention ===
Denial may be reduced by works of history, preservation of archives, documentation of records, investigation panels, search for missing persons, commemorations, official state apologies, development of truth commissions, educational programs, monuments, and museums. According to Johnathan Sisson, the society has the right to know the truth about historical events and facts, and the circumstances that led to massive or systematic human rights violations. He says that the state has the obligation to secure records and other evidence to prevent revisionist arguments. Genocide scholar Gregory Stanton suggests that prosecution can be a deterrent.

<text>Zablujena generacija (&quot;Delusive&quot; or &quot;Stray generation&quot;) is a Slovene &quot;saloon&quot; punk - alternative rock musical group from Idrija.

The group started out in 1994. The original lineup, who took their lead from the legendary American punkers The Ramones, was Primož Alič (vocal, guitar), Ramon (guitar), Aljoša (bass) and Igor Seljak (drums). In those days they played in different garages and cellars in Idrija, and it was there that their first songs originated. Bass guitarist Aljoša was later on substituted with Hanson in 1998.

Zablujena generacija is sometimes compared to blink-182 or The Offspring, but as they&#x27;ve been on the go since 1994, they have developed their own style.

The band has participated in a Slovenian contest EMA 2007 for the Eurovision Song Contest 2007 with a song &quot;Kdo hoče plesati z menoj&quot; (&quot;Who Wants To Dance With Me&quot;).

Their discography includes:
* &quot;Fajht&quot; (colloquial meaning of &quot;Inebriation&quot;), (Vinylmania Records 1997),
* &quot;Pank zabloda&quot; (&quot;Punk Aberration&quot;), (Vinylmania Records 1998),
* Compilation &quot;Drž`te jih! To niso Niet!!!&quot; (&quot;Stop &#x27;em! They Aren&#x27;t Niet!!!&quot;), (Vinylmania Records 1998).
* &quot;Ultra lahko&quot; (&quot;Ultra Light&quot;), (Vinylmania records 2000),
* &quot;Pozitiv vabrejšan&quot; (colloquial meaning of &quot;Positive Vibrations&quot;), (Menart 2001).
* &quot;Pop Idoli&quot; (&quot;Pop Idols&quot;)
* &quot;Mi smo stare pizde&quot; (&quot;We are old cunts&quot;), (Panker Studio 2008).

<doc id="106405" wikidata="Q77181" url="?curid=106405" title="Emil Jannings">
<text>Emil Jannings (born Theodor Friedrich Emil Janenz, 23 July 1884 – 2 January 1950) was a Swiss-born German actor who was popular in Hollywood films in the 1920s. He was the first recipient of the Academy Award for Best Actor for starring roles in &quot;The Last Command&quot; and &quot;The Way of All Flesh&quot;. As of 2025, Jannings is the only German to win in that category.

Jannings is best known for his collaborations with F. W. Murnau and Josef von Sternberg, including the 1930 film &quot;The Blue Angel&quot; (&quot;Der blaue Engel&quot;, with Marlene Dietrich. &quot;The Blue Angel&quot; was meant as a vehicle for Jannings to score a place for himself in the new medium of sound film, but Dietrich stole the show. Jannings later starred in a number of Nazi propaganda films, which made him unemployable as an actor after the defeat of Nazi Germany.

==Childhood and youth==
Jannings was born in Rorschach, Switzerland, the son of Emil Janenz, an American businessman from St. Louis, and his wife Margarethe (&quot;née&quot; Schwabe), originally from Germany. Jannings held German citizenship; while he was still young the family moved to Leipzig in the German Empire and further to Görlitz after the early death of his father.

Jannings ran away from school and went to sea. When he returned to Görlitz, his mother finally allowed him to begin a traineeship at the town state theatre, where he started his stage career. From 1901 onwards he worked with several theatre companies in Bremen, Nuremberg, Leipzig, Königsberg, and Glogau before joining the Deutsches Theater ensemble under director Max Reinhardt in Berlin. Permanently employed since 1915, Jannings met with playwright Karl Vollmöller, fellow actor Ernst Lubitsch, and photographer Frieda Riess. After World War I all were at the heart of Weimar Culture in 1920s Berlin. Jannings made his breakthrough in 1918 with his role as Judge Adam in Kleist&#x27;s &quot;Broken Jug&quot; at the Schauspielhaus.

==Career==

Jannings was a theater actor who went into films, though he remained dissatisfied with the limited expressive possibilities in the silent era. Having signed a contract with the UFA production company, he starred in &quot;Die Augen der Mumie Ma&quot; (&quot;The Eyes of the Mummy&quot;, 1918) and &quot;Madame DuBarry&quot; (1919), both with Pola Negri in the main female part. He also performed in the 1922 film version of &quot;Othello&quot; and in F. W. Murnau&#x27;s 1924 film &quot;The Last Laugh&quot; (&quot;Der Letzte Mann&quot;), as a proud but aged hotel doorman who is demoted to a restroom attendant. Jannings worked with Murnau on two other films; playing the title character in &quot;Tartuffe&quot; (&quot;Herr Tartüff&quot;, 1925), and as Mephistopheles in &quot;Faust&quot; (1926).

===United States===
His increasing popularity enabled Jannings to sign an agreement with Paramount Pictures and eventually follow his acting colleagues Lubitsch and Negri to Hollywood. His first film there, &quot;The Way of All Flesh&quot;, directed by Victor Fleming and now lost, was released in 1927, and in the following year he performed in Josef von Sternberg&#x27;s &quot;The Last Command&quot;. In 1929, Jannings won the first Best Actor Oscar for his work in both films. He and Sternberg also cooperated in &quot;Street of Sin&quot; (1928), though they actually differed about Jannings&#x27; acting in front of the camera.

His Hollywood career came to an end with the advent of talkies as his thick German accent was difficult to understand. His dialogue was initially dubbed by another actor in the part-talkie &quot;The Patriot&quot; (1928) directed by Ernst Lubitsch, although Jannings&#x27; own voice was restored after he objected. Returning to Europe, he starred opposite Marlene Dietrich in the 1930 film &quot;The Blue Angel&quot;, which was filmed simultaneously in English with its German version &quot;Der blaue Engel&quot;.

According to Susan Orlean, author of &quot;Rin Tin Tin: The Life and The Legend&quot;, Jannings was not actually the winner of the first best actor vote, but the runner-up. While researching her book, Orlean thought she discovered that it was in fact Rin Tin Tin, the German Shepherd dog, one of the biggest movie stars of his time, who won the vote. The Academy, however, worried about not being taken seriously if they gave the first Oscar to a dog, chose to award the Oscar to the human runner-up. However, this story has been labeled as absolutely not true by other sources.

In 1960, Jannings was posthumously honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1630 Vine Street for his contribution to motion pictures.

===Nazi Germany===
After the Nazi seizure of power in 1933, Jannings continued his career in the service of Nazi cinema. In Nazi Germany, he starred in several films that were intended to promote Nazism, particularly the &quot;Führerprinzip&quot; by presenting unyielding historical characters, such as &quot;Der alte und der junge König&quot; (&quot;The Old and the Young King&quot; 1934), &quot;Der Herrscher&quot; (&quot;The Ruler&quot; 1937) directed by Veit Harlan, &quot;Robert Koch&quot; (1939), &quot;Ohm Krüger&quot; (&quot;Uncle Kruger&quot;, 1941) and &quot;Die Entlassung&quot; (&quot;Bismarck&#x27;s Dismissal&quot;, 1942). He also performed in his role in &quot;The Broken Jug&quot; directed by Gustav Ucicky. Minister of Propaganda Joseph Goebbels named Jannings an &quot;Artist of the State&quot; (&quot;Staatsschauspieler&quot;)

The shooting of his last film &quot;Wo ist Herr Belling?&quot; was aborted when troops of the Allied Powers entered Germany in spring 1945. Jannings reportedly carried his Oscar statuette with him as proof of his former association with Hollywood. However, his active role in Nazi propaganda meant that he was subject to denazification, effectively ending his career.

In the same period Dietrich became a US citizen and an influential anti-Nazi activist, spending much of the war entertaining troops on the front lines and broadcasting on behalf of the OSS. Dietrich particularly loathed Jannings for his Nazi ties, and would later refer to her former co-star as a &quot;ham&quot;.

After the war with his reputation stained by his work with the Nazi government, he never worked as an actor again.

===Death===

Jannings retired to Strobl near Salzburg, Austria, and became an Austrian citizen in 1947. He died in 1950, aged 65, from liver cancer. He is buried in the St. Wolfgang cemetery. His Best Actor Oscar is now on display at the Berlin Filmmuseum.

==Marriages==
Jannings was married four times. His first three marriages ended in divorce, his last with his death. His last three marriages were to German stage and film actresses, Hanna Ralph, Lucie Höflich, and Gussy Holl. He had a daughter, Ruth-Maria (born 1920), from his first marriage to Lucy Höfling.

<doc id="106407" wikidata="Q79673" url="?curid=106407" title="Millbrook, Alabama">
<text>Millbrook is a city in Autauga and Elmore counties in the U.S. state of Alabama. The population was 16,564 at the 2020 census, up from 14,640 in 2010. It is part of the Montgomery Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Millbrook is located at (32.502054, -86.374456).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (1.75%) is water. 

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification, Millbrook has a humid subtropical climate (abbreviated &quot;Cfa&quot;).

==History==
Millbrook includes the former village of Robinson Springs within its boundaries. Numerous eras delineate Millbrook&#x27;s past.

The area&#x27;s first permanent home &quot;Ellerslie&quot; was completed in 1818 by Georgia Congressman, and Revolutionary War Veteran Bolling Hall. The area&#x27;s second permanent home &quot;Thornfield&quot; was started the following year, and completed in 1820 by pioneer Archibald McKeithen. Both homes still stand, and are private residences.

After its initial settlement, Robinson Springs was known as an early summer resort for wealthy families of Montgomery, and the vicinity. The Robinson Springs United Methodist Church was formed in 1828. The settlers quickly grew out of the log structure, and decided to build a permanent structure. The present church was completed in 1848. The parsonage was sold soon after completion (due to the lack of a steady minister) to noted Alabama historian Albert J. Pickett. It still stands two doors down from the church. In 1852, Robinson Springs played host to Alabama&#x27;s first state fair.

Shadrack Mims, Autauga&#x27;s early historian, describes Robinson Springs (circa 1850) as &quot;a spot selected by Todd Robinson as a retreat from the river; and much good sense did he show in such selection - for, if the whole South was searched over, a more healthy spot, in my opinion, could not be found. It is altogether rural in its appearance, the forest growth being untouched, only for garden spots. As to water, it cannot be excelled any where for coolness, clearness, and pleasantness, and the abundance of it. The building situations are beautiful. Upon the whole, it is just the place for a summer retreat; just the place for a school - healthy and high, and free from the temptations so common in villages and cities.&quot;

1861 saw many of the area&#x27;s youth go off to fight in the Civil War. In June 1862, Private Bolling Hall III, on leave from fighting in Virginia, mustered a company of men under a tree at the current site of the confederate monument. They elected him captain, and the company a part of Hilliards Legion. Remnants were later morphed into the 59th Alabama Infantry, with Colonel Bolling Hall III commanding. No remarkable events took place here during the war.

During the post-World War I and pre-World War II period, the communities of Millbrook, Coosada, and Robinson Springs, later referred to as the Tri-Community, began to evolve into populated growing communities, complete with schools, churches, and rail transportation.

As in the 1930s, much of today&#x27;s progress is linked to transportation. With the introduction of Interstate 65 in the mid 1970s, Millbrook&#x27;s growth led to formal incorporation as a city in 1977. Once again, those seeking a more relaxing lifestyle discovered the interstate exits immediately north of the state capital and the Millbrook population grew even more.

* Spectre set ruins – In the 2003 film &quot;Big Fish&quot;, the lead character visits the idealistic town of Spectre at multiple points in his life. In reality, the facades of Spectre were built on a private island on the Alabama River. A rundown version of the town was the last to be filmed, so when the sets were abandoned, they already looked as though they had been neglected for decades.
