<text>Carroll is a city in, and the county seat of, Carroll County, Iowa, United States, along the Middle Raccoon River. The population was 10,321 in the 2020 census.

== History ==
Carroll was laid out in 1867. It took its name from Carroll County, which was named in honor of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, Maryland. He was the only Roman Catholic to sign the Declaration of Independence.

In 1869, the centrally located railroad town of Carroll City was selected as the county seat, replacing, with some protest, Carrollton. Later a $4,000 courthouse was constructed on the town square. This building was used until it burned to the ground in 1886. The vaults and records were undamaged, however, and moved to temporary housing in the Joyce Building and Drees&#x27; Music Hall.

The following winter a $40,000 bond issue was approved toward the construction of a new, permanent courthouse. The stone-and-brick building was built on the northwest corner of the square (the parking lot of the current courthouse). The courthouse, complete with a clock-tower, was used for more than three-quarters of a century, then replaced by a modern-looking building in 1965.

A $750,000 bond issue was used to construct and equip the new courthouse. This building was officially dedicated on September 24, 1966. The highlight of the dedication ceremony was the opening of the boxes sealed in the cornerstone of the old courthouse. The bell from the previous courthouse clock tower sits on the courthouse grounds.

The town was the site of the 1960 Minneapolis Lakers cornfield landing. A Douglas DC-3 carrying the coach and players of the Minneapolis Lakers, made an emergency landing in a cornfield during a snowstorm after having got lost due to an electrical malfunction and poor weather.

<text>Coon Rapids is a city in Carroll and Guthrie counties in the U.S. state of Iowa. The population was 1,300 at the 2020 census, which is a decrease of 5 from the 2000 census. The small portion of Coon Rapids that lies in Guthrie County is part of the Des Moines–West Des Moines Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Crocket Ribble and Jacob Cretsinger, residents of Carrollton (the county seat of Carroll County at the time), decided to try their hand in real estate. They purchased land along the Middle Raccoon River, built a saw and grist mill and went into business in 1864. Between the impact of the Civil War and later national panics, frontier settlement slowed down. However, the partners were able to establish a post office, named Coon Rapids; it soon became a stop for stagecoach service to Sioux City. Returning civil war veterans, William Minnich and his brother-in-law, Michael Shettler, saw potential in the hamlet. After purchasing land, they submitted a plat for the village of Coon Rapids and built what would become a store-hotel and home for the Shettler family. Minnich maintained his farm in adjoining Guthrie County. Between 1870 and 1880, the hamlet grew as former farmers became merchants and tradesmen and newcomers came to the area. In addition to the Mill, the town had several general stores offering an array of goods, a hardware store, implement dealer and the all-important real estate agent.

When the Chicago, St Paul and Milwaukee started to build a rail line about a half mile southwest of the hamlet, they established a rough and tumble camp for their workers, many of whom were accompanied by their families. The railroad project provided jobs and good money for local boys and newcomers, from which an economic boom began. Between 1880 and 1886, merchants in the village of Coon Rapids moved their buildings into what the railroad had platted as a town. Main street slowly became lined with business houses and homes and the area between the old and new towns slowly was transformed into a residential area. The town nearly doubled in population and the new commercial center by the railroad expanded with a variety of new and old businesses. In 1886, a tornado ripped across western Iowa, with Coon Rapids in its path. The eastern part of town was demolished and two people were killed. Help poured in from around the United States and the town rebuilt. However, the wooden frontier community was vulnerable to fire. Between 1887 and 1894, a multitude of fires occurred some caused by arson, others by lightning, and others the result of cinders from flues igniting dry, shingled roofs.

During the late 19th century, Coon Rapids developed a modern, fireproof commercial district made up of brick buildings, exhibiting a variety of Victorian facades. The town installed the amenities of urban life such as theater productions, roller skating, bowling, billiards, restaurants and a variety of shops and services, dray lines and livery barns. There were wooden sidewalks and street lights. A night watch and sheriff kept night time lawlessness in control and limited racing down Main street. Now there were community celebrations such as July 4 and Decoration Day for both town and rural folk. A town baseball team was another attraction. The town became a service center for a growing agricultural economy. Church and club celebrations also became part of community life and served to integrate community and countryside.

In response to the increased town and rural population and agricultural specialization, Coon Rapids saw the appearance of service industries to support the changing farm economy. There were carpenters specializing in farm building construction, well diggers, tiling and drainage concerns, dealers in cement and other types of fencing, a creamery to support the burgeoning dairy and poultry industry. By the early twentieth century, Coon Rapids was the dominant trading center between Perry and Manning. The downtown was filled with two and three storey brick buildings and offered an array of shops, services, and amenities such as an opera house, bowling alley, restaurants, a hotel and other amusements. From a simple market and trading point, Coon Rapids had become the economic, social, recreational and service center for the four county areas. It continued in this role despite the fall in farm values in the late teens and Great Depression of the 1930s.

The entrepreneurial tradition that marks Coon Rapids was expressed in the twentieth century by businesses that served the diverse agricultural economy of the area. These included major grain dealers who maintained elevators in town, lumber men, implement dealers, a creamery and related produce stations, extensive poultry operations, a stock yard and sale barn. Of particular importance to the town&#x27;s 20th century life was the emergence of the hybrid corn business.

Industrial agriculture transformed the Midwest in the post WW II era. Economies of scale shifted centers of production, for example, the poultry business became concentrated in the southeastern United States, the size of farms increased, corporate rather than individual farming operations became the norm. For Coon Rapids this had varied impacts. Garst and Thomas Seed had expanded into an international concern by the mid-1950s offering local employment opportunities . Garst and Thomas expanded physically, literally taking over many of the downtown buildings in Coon Rapids, converting them to laboratory and office space. The city&#x27;s residential areas grew during the late twentieth century, largely due to the employment offered by Garst and Thomas. Although the range and variety of downtown shops and businesses changed between 1950 and the farm crisis of the 1980s, the town maintained basic services such as a grocery store, hardware store, real estate and insurance agencies, banks, lumber yard, and agricultural service businesses. In September 1959, Coon Rapids played a role in promoting &quot;détente&quot; between the United States and the Soviet Union, when area resident Roswell Garst hosted Soviet premier Nikita Khrushchev on his farm.

In October 2005, Coon Rapids-Whiterock area was elected a &quot;Great Place&quot; of Iowa for its rich history and resources, and creative future vision. The Great Places program, launched by Governor Tom Vilsack and implemented by the Department of Cultural Affairs, aimed to concentrate state agency resources on high-potential communities.

The local Great Place committee represents an alliance between the nonprofit Whiterock Conservancy, the City of Coon Rapids, and the Coon Rapids Development Group. Whiterock Conservancy is an Iowan nonprofit organized in late 2004 to administer a private conservation land donation from the Garst family of Coon Rapids. Its goals are environmental restoration, sustainable agriculture, and low-impact public use and education.

The first three Iowa Great Places (Coon Rapids, Clinton and Sioux City) were each awarded $1 million in seed money by the Iowa legislature. In September 2007, Coon Rapids was also awarded a $1.7 million Vision Iowa grant. The Coon Rapids Great Place Program combines natural resource restoration with trails, public park development, elder care, diversity, historic preservation, microenterprise support, and tourism marketing.

<text>Manning is a city in Carroll County, Iowa, United States, along Iowa Highway 141. The population was 1,455 at the time of the 2020 census. It is named for Orlando Harrison Manning, a Lieutenant Governor of Iowa.

==History==
Prior to the city&#x27;s formation, the area of Manning was a swampy region occasionally used by local Iowa (people) for hunting. There were no nearby rivers and few trees.

The Iowa Southwestern railroad was completed in 1880. Some yards and a depot were constructed at the future location of Manning in 1881. In the same year, the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad constructed a road across Iowa, south of and parallel to, the Northwest. These railroads intersected at what is now Manning.

In 1969, an unknown saboteur used dynamite to bomb one of the rails and derail the passenger train traveling on the east——west Milwaukee railroad line (presently the Burlington Northern), apparently hoping that it would careen into the Nishnabotna river below. The train came to a safe stop but only after it derailed. The crime was never solved; no group claimed responsibility and no motive for the bombing was ever discovered.

==Geography==
Manning is located along the West Nishnabotna River near its source.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

Today, the depot serves as the offices of the Chamber of Commerce.

A log cabin stands in Atlantic City Park with a historical plaque bearing the following inscription:
Another story told about Atlantic is the way the main street was located. Someone asked Whitney where it should be placed. He marked the center at current day 6th and Chestnut and then plowed two furrows apart all the way up to the railroad, just north of Second Street.

Since 1929, Atlantic is noted for the Atlantic Coca-Cola Bottling Company, which bottles and distributes drinks from The Coca-Cola Company to Iowa and parts of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Missouri.

<text>Tipton () is a city in Cedar County, Iowa, United States. The population was 3,149 at the time of the 2020 census. It is the county seat of Cedar County.

==History==
Tipton was platted within Center Township in 1840 and was named for General John Tipton, a personal friend of the founder, Henry W. Higgins. The city was incorporated on January 27, 1857.
=== Railroad history ===
Tipton was continually bypassed by Iowa railroads, beginning with the collapse of the Lyons Iowa Central RR in 1854. The Iowa Southwestern RR, organized in 1870, planned to connect with the Chicago &amp; North Western to the north but failed, even with the help of the Chicago Burlington &amp; Quincy and considerable construction activity. 
Meanwhile the Tipton &amp; Stanwood RR, organized in 1858, had been trying unsuccessfully for years to connect with the Chicago Iowa &amp; Nebraska RR building from Clinton to Cedar Rapids. The CI&amp;N was in fact the road that had by the 1870s become the C&amp;NW, 8.5 miles to the north of Tipton. 

Finally in 1872 the C&amp;NW decided to assist the T&amp;S and make the connection. 
Col. James Henry Howe, General Manager of the C&amp;NW, notified Isaac B Howe, Supt. of the Iowa Div. by telegraph:
 &quot;Green Bay 29 I.B. Howe[no relation],
 We have concluded substantially to build the Tipton branch. Can you make the survey and estimates at once or set somebody at it. 
 J. H. Howe&quot; 
&quot;The first train of cars arrived at Tipton on Thanksgiving day, 1872&quot;

This line ran east and west through the southern part of Tipton and was abandoned in the 1950s. Evidence of this abandoned right-of-way can still be seen in Tipton in a few places.

Before the American Civil War, areas in and around West Branch were stops of the Underground Railroad. Abolitionist John Brown once stayed at the Maxson farm east of West Branch. He also stayed at James Townsend&#x27;s inn, the Traveler&#x27;s Rest, in the winter of 1856. In 2008, archaeologists found evidence of unmarked graves in nearby North Liberty Cemetery while investigating an account of 17 escaped slaves who died before reaching Canada.
West Branch experienced rapid growth after the Burlington, Cedar Rapids and Northern Railway was built through it.

President Herbert Hoover was born in West Branch in 1874. The Herbert Hoover Presidential Library-Museum was dedicated here by Hoover and his close friend, President Harry Truman, in 1962. The Herbert Hoover National Historic Site, which includes the Library-Museum, the Hoover Birthplace Cottage and the gravesites of President and Lou Henry Hoover, was authorized by Congress on August 12, 1965.

<text>Clear Lake is a city in Cerro Gordo County, Iowa, United States. The population was 7,687 at the 2020 census. The city is named for the large lake on which it is located. It is the home of a number of marinas, state parks and tourism-related businesses. Clear Lake is also a major stop on Interstate 35 with many restaurants, hotels and truck stops.

== History ==

The region around the lake that would later be called Clear Lake was a summer home to the Dakota and Winnebago American Indians. During a land survey of northern Iowa done in 1832 by Nathan Boone, the son of the famous explorer Daniel Boone, a map was made showing the lake and other bodies of water in the area.

In 1851, Joseph Hewitt and James Dickirson brought their families to camp on the east side of Clear Lake, soon building a cabin, and began a friendship with the Winnebago natives. By 1853, many more white settlers had also came to settle in the area. By the year 1855, the first Clear Lake school was built as well as the first steam saw mill. In that year a hotel was built by James Crow.

By 1870, the town had 775 residents and by 1871 the streets were graded and sidewalks were made of raised boards, sure signs of a thriving new city. The city of Clear Lake was incorporated on May 26, 1871. The first bandstand in Clear Lake was built in 1877 at the City Park. The town continued to grow and built its first library in 1889. In 1909, Bayside Amusement park opened for the first time. The first North Iowa Band Festival was organized by John Kopecky, among others, in 1932.

In 1933, the Surf Ballroom opened up on the site of the old Tom Tom ballroom that had been destroyed by fire. The opening dance night saw approximately 700 couples attend. In 1947, the Surf Ballroom burned down; a new Surf Ballroom was built across the street the following year. The Bayside Amusement park closed down in 1958.

=== The Day the Music Died ===

In the early hours of February 3, 1959, a Beechcraft Bonanza aircraft carrying Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and The Big Bopper, who had been performing at the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake, took off from the local runway in nearby Mason City, on its way to the next show in Moorhead, Minnesota.

The plane crashed soon after take off, killing everyone aboard including the 21-year old pilot Roger Peterson. The event was later eulogized by folk singer Don McLean in his 1971 song &quot;American Pie&quot;, which led to the crash being nicknamed &quot;The Day the Music Died&quot;.

In June 1988, around 600 people gathered to witness the dedication of the monument to the three musicians. Clear Lake also renamed Second Place North to &quot;Buddy Holly Place&quot;.

Clear Creek Elementary School hosts preschool, kindergarten, and grades 1–5; Clear Lake Middle School hosts grades 6–8; and Clear Lake High School hosts grades 9–12. Lakeside Alternative, an alternative school program, is run jointly with the Garner–Hayfield–Ventura Community School District in neighboring Ventura, Iowa.

Clear Lake Classical, a preK–8 Classical Christian school, is the only private school in the city.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Transportation ===

Clear Lake is located along Interstate 35 approximately halfway between the Twin Cities and Des Moines, Iowa. U.S. Highway 18 runs east–west through the northern side of the city until it meets Interstate 35; at this interchange, Iowa Highway 122 begins and continues to the east. U.S. 18 proper continues to the south, overlapping an approximately 3.5-mile stretch of Interstate 35 and Iowa Highway 27 (part of the Avenue of the Saints). Just south of the city, U.S. 18 and Iowa 27 break from Interstate 35 and continue to the east.

The North Iowa Area Council of Governments operates Region 2 Transit, which provides city and regional demand responsive public bus transit. Jefferson Lines, a private intercity bus service, maintains a stop in Clear Lake with service to locations throughout the Midwest.

Mason City Municipal Airport is located immediately to the east of Clear Lake.

Two freight rail lines run through the city. Canadian Pacific Railway operates a line parallel to U.S. 18, which stops at a minor grain facility; trackage rights are given to the Iowa Northern Railway. Progressive Rail maintains the Iowa Traction Railway, a shortline railroad which runs between Clear Lake and Mason City.

=== Utilities ===

The city&#x27;s electric power and natural gas utilities are provided by Alliant Energy. Since 2004, Alliant Energy has operated a natural gas—fired electricity generation plant southeast of the city.

Sewage treatment is provided by the Clear Lake Sanitary District, a local government entity separate from the city government. Wastewater travels through pump stations within the city before being routed to a treatment plant to the south. There, it is filtered, processed through a sequencing batch reactor, and disinfected with ultraviolet light. Some of the resulting treated effluent is routed to the nearby Alliant Energy plant for cooling purposes.

Telephone, cable television, and internet services are provided by local provider CL Tel and Mediacom.

Water supply services are provided by the city. The city&#x27;s water is drawn from shallow wells in the Cedar Valley Formation.

Waste collection services are also provided by the city and operated by local company Absolute Waste Removal. Further processing is performed at the Landfill of North Iowa to the east.

=== Health care ===
MercyOne Medical Center North Iowa in neighboring Mason City is the nearest hospital. Both MercyOne and Iowa Specialty Hospital operate clinics within the city.

In September 2020, construction began on a wellness center near Clear Lake High School for joint use by Clear Lake Community School District and the community.

===Landmarks===
; Architecture and the Prairie School
Mason City is widely known for its collection of Prairie School architecture. The Rock Crest-Rock Glen Historic District is the largest concentration of any city in Iowa. At least 32 houses and one commercial building were built in the Prairie Style between 1908 and 1922, 17 of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and eight more are contributing properties to a historic district.

The first two Prairie structures, the Dr. G.C. Stockman House (1908) and the Park Inn Hotel and City National Bank Buildings (1909–1910) were both designed by Frank Lloyd Wright. The hotel and bank, a mixed-use development at the corner of State and Federal Avenues was the first to be commissioned by local attorneys James E. E. Markley and James E. Blythe. Within a year, Wright was hired to design the Stockman House by Markley&#x27;s neighbor.

Both the Park Inn Hotel and Stockman House suffered from neglect and unsympathetic alterations before they were saved by community organizations. In 1989, the Stockman House was moved four blocks to prevent its demolition; it was subsequently restored and opened to the public by the River City Society for Historic Preservation. Likewise, Wright on the Park, Inc. began restoration on the Park Inn Hotel in 2005 and the former City National Bank building in 2007. The organization reopened both buildings as a boutique hotel in August 2011. The Park Inn Hotel is last remaining of the few hotels that Wright completed during his career and is considered a prototype for Wright&#x27;s Imperial Hotel.

The Rock Glen and Rock Crest National Historic district is a small enclave of single-family homes situated along the banks of Willow Creek five blocks east of downtown. It is the largest collection of prairie-style homes in a natural setting in the world. It features both Prairie School and Usonian design. Five of these houses were designed by Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin, two by Francis Barry Byrne, and others by William Drummond, Einar Broaten, and Curtis Besinger.

In addition to Prairie Style architecture, Mason City is home to extensive Victorian, Craftsman, and Bungalow style homes, as well as historic commercial structures, dates from between 1892 and 1940, including the Brick and Tile Building at the intersection of State and Delaware Streets.

The Mason City Public Library was designed by Chicago architects Holabird and Root in 1939.

The Len Jus Building on North Federal Avenue has an extremely rare sheet-metal facade, it had been placed on the Iowa Historic Preservation Alliance&#x27;s Most Endangered list because of its poor repair and indifferent ownership, but is now being rehabilitated by the new owner.

===Public Art===
Since 2014, Mason City has hosted &quot;River City Sculptures on Parade,&quot; an annual public art walk featuring rotating artists. Each year, the city purchases the most-popular rotating sculpture to add to the permanent collection.

==Sports==
Mason City has some history of minor league and amateur sports teams despite its relatively small size.

The North Iowa Bulls are a junior ice hockey team that first began play in 2011 as member of the North American 3 Hockey League (NA3HL). The Bulls won the league championship in 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2021, while also winning the Tier III National Championship in 2013 and 2015. The Bulls moved up to the Tier II North American Hockey League (NAHL) and rebranded the Tier III team as the Mason City Toros in 2021. The North Iowa Outlaws junior hockey team previously played in the NAHL from 2005 until 2010, when they relocated to Onalaska, Wisconsin, to become the Coulee Region Chill. The North Iowa Huskies played in the United States Hockey League from 1983 to 1999 and then moved to Cedar Rapids.

Mason City was home to minor league baseball. The Mason City Cementmakers (1912) and Mason City Claydiggers (1915–1917) played as members of the Iowa State League (1912) and Central Association (1915–1917). The teams played at Hanford Park.

The Mason City Bats of the short-lived Great Central League played baseball here in 1994.

College Football Hall of Fame coach Barry Alvarez led Mason City High School to the 1978 Class 4A state football championship with a 15–13 victory over Dubuque Hempstead.

==Schools==
Meservey is part of the West Fork Community School District, formed in 2011 by the merger of the Sheffield–Chapin–Meservey–Thornton (SCMT) Community School District and the Rockwell–Swaledale Community School District. Meservey became a part of the West Fork whole grade-sharing school system, prior to the official merging of districts, as of the 2008–09 school year. SCMT was formed in 2007 by the merger of the Meservey–Thornton Community School District and the Sheffield–Chapin Community School District. Meservey–Thornton, in turn, formed in 1963 from the merger of the Meservey Community School District and the Thornton Community School District.

===Meservey School===
The Consolidated Independent School District of Meservey, Iowa, was seeking a builder for its school in the 1920s.

The Meservey school building was built in the 1940s (as a Works Progress Administration project) as a K–12 facility for Meservey High School. In 1963, it became an elementary and junior high school for the combined Meservey–Thornton school district. At a later time it became elementary school only as junior high classes were moved to Thornton. Due to declining enrollments, the building was closed in 1983, when all K–12 classes met in the Thornton facility. In 1988, Meservey–Thornton began whole-grade sharing with Sheffield–Chapin school district. The Meservey school facility was razed sometime around 1993, and the property is now Schoolhouse Park.

Meservey High School&#x27;s mascot was the Rockets. The Meservey–Thornton mascot was the &quot;Lancers&quot;. When the high school classes moved to Sheffield in 1988, the Lancer mascot was retained for the middle-school sports teams. However, with further consolidation in 2007, the Lancer mascot was officially retired with a parade in Thornton in July 2007.

Due to continued declining enrollment, the former S-C, M-T, and neighboring Rockwell–Swaledale school districts entered into a grade-sharing agreement to form the West Fork school partnership in 2008, with the &quot;Warhawks&quot; as the new mascot. All students now attend Sheffield and Rockwell. Each remaining school will have K–3, Rockwell will house 4–8 and Sheffield 9–12. The districts legally merged in 2011.

==History==

Nora Springs was founded in 1857 and was incorporated in 1875. It was first called Woodstock, but community pioneer Edson Gaylord, managed to persuade wealthy pioneer Edward Greeley of nearby Woodbridge (later Nashua) to come to town. Greeley agreed to buy and improve the gristmill, and to purchase 20 acres of land from Gaylord, if the town would change its name from Woodstock to Elnora, in honor of a former lady love from Vermont. Gaylord had wanted the town to be named &quot;Springs&quot; and as a result of a compromise, Woodstock became Elnora Springs, quickly shortened to Nora Springs. Shortly thereafter, Greeley made a trip to Vermont; upon his return, he sold the land back to Gaylord, returned to Woodbridge, and never visited Nora Springs again.

At its founding, the town&#x27;s business district was located near the millpond and nearby gristmill, at the western end of present day Sixth Street NW. Two competing railroads began laying track several blocks to the south; as a result, the downtown gradually moved nearer to the rail lines, and the former business district became known to locals as Old Town. The gristmill went out of business, and stood empty for many years. It was demolished in the late 1950s. The millrace and dam still exist, and in recent years, the city has developed the area into a scenic park. A footbridge over the Shell Rock River dam was constructed in 2019,

==Education==
Thornton is part of the West Fork Community School District, formed in 2011 by the merger of the Sheffield–Chapin–Meservey–Thornton (SCMT) Community School District and the Rockwell–Swaledale Community School District. Thornton became a part of the West Fork Schools whole grade-sharing partnership as of the 2008–09 school year, prior to the formal district merger. SCMT was formed in 2007 by the merger of the Meservey–Thornton Community School District and the Sheffield–Chapin Community School District. Meservey–Thornton, in turn, formed in 1963 from the merger of the Thornton Community School District and the Meservey Community School District.

Thornton Public Library serves the community.

===Thornton School===
The school building served the community until 2007. The mascot for secondary athletic teams was the Lancers.

There was a prior school building that was destroyed in a fire. The new building opened in 1936 and received extra classrooms, office space, a gymnasium, and a library in a 1955 addition. The building initially served Thornton and its associated school district only, but after it merged into Meservey–Thornton in 1963 it began serving the consolidated district&#x27;s senior high school students. Junior high school students were later moved to the building. The Meservey School closed in 1983, making the Thornton School K–12. High school students were moved out of the building as a result of the grade-sharing agreement between Meservey–Thornton and Sheffield–Chapin. At that point the Lancers mascot was now only used at the middle school level.

Due to declining enrollment, the former S-C, M-T, and neighboring Rockwell–Swaledale school districts entered a whole-grade sharing agreement to become the West Fork school system in 2008, with the &quot;Warhawks&quot; as the new mascot. The Thornton building closed after the 2007–08 season after 72 years of service, and all students now attend Sheffield and Rockwell. Each remaining school will have K–3, Rockwell will house 4–8 and Sheffield 9–12. The school districts formally merged in 2011. On July 5, 2008, an all-school reunion was held to commemorate the closing of the Thornton School.

In 2007 the Lancers mascot was discontinued. The Thornton residents held a celebratory farewell parade at that time. The school closed that in July 2008. The Thornton school was demolished in 2012 by the Dumont company Peterson Backhoe; the SCMT district chose demolition after a tentative agreement for another party to buy the building fell through in 2009.

Aurelia was founded in 1873 as a stop along the Illinois Central Railroad branch connecting Sioux City, Iowa, to Chicago, Illinois.

==Schools==
The River Valley Community School District operates public schools serving the community. It was established on July 1, 1996 by the merger of the Eastwood Community School District and the Willow Community School District.

Quimby once had its own school district, its mascot known as &quot;Peacocks,&quot; but financial pressure and dwindling enrollment forced the school to combine with nearby Washta school district in the early-1960s to create Willow Community School District, the mascot being the T-Birds. In the early 1990s, similar factors led to the merger of Willow and nearby Eastwood School district to form River Valley School District, with the mascot of the Wolverines. The district encompasses the towns of Quimby, Washta, Cushing, and Correctionville. Although Quimby is the second-largest, it does not house a portion of the school&#x27;s classes.

Quimby maintained a school building, which housed River Valley Middle School classes until the building, constructed in 1921, became too expensive to keep up to code. The building was sold to a local resident, Tim Tapper, who held the property for several years before selling it to a private developer who demolished the building.

==Recreation==
Quimby boasts a nine-hole golf course, a rarity for towns in the area of relative size.

<doc id="112882" wikidata="Q2068348" url="?curid=112882" title="Videotex">
<text>Videotex (or interactive videotex) was one of the earliest implementations of an end-user information system. From the late 1970s to early 2010s, it was used to deliver information (usually pages of text) to a user in computer-like format, typically to be displayed on a television or a dumb terminal.

In a strict definition, videotex is any system that provides interactive content and displays it on a video monitor such as a television, typically using modems to send data in both directions. A close relative is teletext, which sends data in one direction only, typically encoded in a television signal. All such systems are occasionally referred to as &quot;viewdata&quot;. Unlike the modern Internet, traditional videotex services were highly centralized.

Videotex in its broader definition can be used to refer to any such service, including teletext, the Internet, bulletin board systems, online service providers, and even the arrival/departure displays at an airport. This usage is no longer common.

With the exception of Minitel in France, videotex elsewhere never managed to attract any more than a very small percentage of the universal mass market once envisaged. By the end of the 1980s its use was essentially limited to a few niche applications.

== Initial development and technologies ==

=== United Kingdom ===
The first attempts at a general-purpose videotex service were created in the United Kingdom in the late 1960s. In about 1970 the BBC had a brainstorming session in which it was decided to start researching ways to send closed captioning information to the audience. As the Teledata research continued the BBC became interested in using the system for delivering any sort of information, not just closed captioning.
In 1972, the concept was first made public under the new name Ceefax. Meanwhile, the General Post Office (soon to become British Telecom) had been researching a similar concept since the late 1960s, known as Viewdata. Unlike Ceefax which was a one-way service carried in the existing TV signal, Viewdata was a two-way system using telephones. Since the Post Office owned the telephones, this was considered to be an excellent way to drive more customers to use the phones. Not to be outdone by the BBC, they also announced their service, under the name Prestel. ITV soon joined the fray with a Ceefax-clone known as ORACLE.

In 1974, all the services agreed on a standard for displaying the information. The display would be a simple 40×24 grid of text, with some &quot;graphics characters&quot; for constructing simple graphics, revised and finalized in 1976. The standard did not define the delivery system, so both Viewdata-like and Teledata-like services could at least share the TV-side hardware, which was expensive at the time. The standard also introduced a new term that covered all such services, teletext. Ceefax first started operation in 1974 with a limited 30 pages, followed quickly by ORACLE and then Prestel in 1979.

By 1981, Prestel International was available in nine countries, and a number of countries, including Sweden, The Netherlands, Finland and West Germany were developing their own national systems closely based on Prestel. General Telephone and Electronics (GTE) acquired an exclusive agency for the system for North America.

In the early 1980s, videotex became the base technology for the London Stock Exchange&#x27;s pricing service called TOPIC. Later versions of TOPIC, notably TOPIC2 and TOPIC3, were developed by Thanos Vassilakis and introduced trading and historic price feeds.

=== France ===

Development of a French teletext-like system began in 1973. A very simple 2-way videotex system called Tictac was also demonstrated in the mid-1970s. As in the UK, this led on to work to develop a common display standard for videotex and teletext, called Antiope, which was finalised in 1977. Antiope had similar capabilities to the UK system for displaying alphanumeric text and chunky &quot;mosaic&quot; character-based block graphics. A difference however was that while in the UK standard control codes automatically also occupied one character position on screen, Antiope allowed for &quot;non spacing&quot; control codes. This gave Antiope slightly more flexibility in the use of colours in mosaic block graphics, and in presenting the accents and diacritics of the French language.

Meanwhile, spurred on by the 1978 Nora/Minc report, the French government was determined to catch up on a perceived falling behind in its computer and communications facilities. In 1980 it began field trials issuing Antiope-based terminals for free to over 250,000 telephone subscribers in Ille-et-Vilaine region, where the French CCETT research centre was based, for use as telephone directories. The trial was a success, and in 1982 Minitel was rolled out nationwide.

===Canada===

Since 1970, researchers at the Communications Research Centre (CRC) in Ottawa had been working on a set of &quot;picture description instructions&quot;, which encoded graphics commands as a text stream. Graphics were encoded as a series of instructions (graphics primitives) each represented by a single ASCII character. Graphic coordinates were encoded in multiple 6 bit strings of XY coordinate data, flagged to place them in the printable ASCII range so that they could be transmitted with conventional text transmission techniques. ASCII SI/SO characters were used to differentiate the text from graphic portions of a transmitted &quot;page&quot;. In 1975, the CRC gave a contract to Norpak to develop an interactive graphics terminal that could decode the instructions and display them on a colour display, which was successfully up and running by 1977.

Against the background of the developments in Europe, CRC was able to persuade the Canadian government to develop the system into a fully-fledged service. In August 1978, the Canadian Department of Communications publicly launched it as Telidon, a &quot;second generation&quot; videotex/teletext service, and committed to a four-year development plan to encourage rollout. Compared to the European systems, Telidon offered real graphics, as opposed to block-mosaic character graphics. The downside was that it required much more advanced decoders, typically featuring Zilog Z80 or Motorola 6809 processors.

===Japan===

Research in Japan was shaped by the demands of the large number of Kanji characters used in Japanese script. With 1970s technology, the ability to generate so many characters on demand in the end-user&#x27;s terminal was seen as prohibitive. Instead, development focussed on methods to send pages to user terminals pre-rendered, using coding strategies similar to facsimile machines. This led to a videotex system called Captain (&quot;Character and Pattern Telephone Access Information Network&quot;), created by NTT in 1978, which went into full trials from 1979 to 1981. The system also lent itself naturally to photographic images, albeit at only moderate resolution. However, the pages typically took two or three times longer to load, compared to the European systems. NHK developed an experimental teletext system along similar lines, called CIBS (&quot;Character Information Broadcasting Station&quot;). Based on a 388×200 pixel resolution, it was first announced in 1976, and began trials in late 1978. (NHK&#x27;s ultimate production teletext system launched in 1983).

== Standards ==
Work to establish an international standard for videotex began in 1978 in CCITT. But the national delegations showed little interest in compromise, each hoping that &quot;their&quot; system would come to define what was perceived to be going to be an enormous new mass-market. In 1980 CCITT therefore issued recommendation S.100 (later T.100), noting the points of similarity but the essential incompatibility of the systems, and declaring all four to be recognised options.

Trying to kick-start the market, AT&amp;T Corporation entered the fray, and in May 1981 announced its own Presentation Layer Protocol (PLP). This was closely based on the Canadian Telidon system, but added to it some further graphics primitives and a syntax for defining macros, algorithms to define cleaner pixel spacing for the (arbitrarily sizeable) text, and also dynamically redefinable characters and a mosaic block graphic character set, so that it could reproduce content from the French Antiope. After some further revisions this was adopted in 1983 as ANSI standard X3.110, more commonly called NAPLPS, the North American Presentation Layer Protocol Syntax. It was also adopted in 1988 as the presentation-layer syntax for NABTS, the North American Broadcast Teletext Specification.

Meanwhile, the European national Postal Telephone and Telegraph (PTT) agencies were also increasingly interested in videotex, and had convened discussions in European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) to co-ordinate developments, which had been diverging along national lines. As well as the British and French standards, the Swedes had proposed extending the British Prestel standard with a new set of smoother mosaic graphics characters; while the specification for the proposed German Bildschirmtext (BTX) system, developed under contract by IBM Germany for Deutsche Bundespost, was growing increasingly baroque. Originally conceived to follow the UK Prestel system, it had accreted elements from all the other European standards and more. This became the basis for setting out the CEPT recommendation T/CD 06-01, also proposed in May 1981.

However, due to national pressure, CEPT stopped short of fixing a single standard, and instead recognised four &quot;profiles&quot;: 
*CEPT1, corresponding to the German &quot;BTX&quot;; 
*CEPT2, the French &quot;Minitel&quot;; 
*CEPT3, the British &quot;Prestel&quot;; 
*CEPT4, the Swedish &quot;Prestel Plus&quot;.

National videotex services were encouraged to follow one of the existing four basic profiles; or if they extended them, to do so in ways compatible with a &quot;harmonised enhanced&quot; specification. 
There was talk of upgrading Prestel to the full CEPT standard &quot;within a couple of years&quot;. But in the event, it never happened. The German BTX eventually established CEPT1; the French Minitel continued with CEPT2, which was ready to roll out; and the British stayed with CEPT3, by now too established to break compatibility.

The other countries of Europe adopted a patchwork of the different profiles.

In later years, CEPT fixed a number of standards for extension levels to the basic service: for photographic images (based on JPEG; T/TE 06-01, later revisions), for alpha-geometric graphics, similar to NAPLPS/Telidon (T/TE 06-02), for transferring larger data files and software (T/TE 06-03), for active terminal-side capabilities and scripting (T/TE 06-04), and for discovery of terminal capabilities (T/TE 06-05). But interest in them was limited.

CCITT T.101

== Character set ==

ISO-IR registered character sets for Videotex use include variants of T.51, semigraphic mosaic sets, specialised C0 control codes, and four sets of specialised C1 control codes.

== Uptake ==
=== United Kingdom ===

Prestel was somewhat popular for a time, but never gained anywhere near the popularity of Ceefax. This may have been due primarily to the relatively low penetration of suitable hardware in British homes, requiring the user to pay for the terminal (today referred to as a set-top box), a monthly charge for the service, and phone bills on top of that (unlike the US, local calls were paid for in most of Europe at that time). In the late 1980s the system was re-focused as a provider of financial data, and eventually bought out by the Financial Times in 1994. It continues today in name only, as FT&#x27;s information service. A closed access videotex system based on the Prestel model was developed by the travel industry, and continues to be almost universally used by travel agents throughout the country.

Using a prototype domestic television equipped with the Prestel chip set, Michael Aldrich of Redifon Computers Ltd demonstrated a real-time transaction processing in 1979; the idea is currently referred to as online shopping. Starting in 1980, he designed, sold and installed systems with major UK companies including the world&#x27;s first travel industry system, the world&#x27;s first vehicle locator system for one of the world&#x27;s largest auto manufacturers and the world&#x27;s first supermarket system. He wrote a book about his ideas and systems which among other topics explored a future of online shopping and remote working that has proven to be prophetic. Before the IBM PC, Microsoft MS-DOS and the Internet or World Wide Web, he invented and manufactured and sold the &quot; &#x27;Teleputer&#x27; &quot;, a PC that communicated using its Prestel chip set.

The &quot;Teleputer &quot;was a range of computers that were suffixed with a number. Only the &quot;Teleputer 1&quot; and &quot;Teleputer 3&quot; were manufactured and sold. The &quot;Teleputer 1&quot; was a very simple device and only worked as a teletex terminal, whereas the &quot;Teleputer 3&quot; was a Z80 based microcomputer. It ran with a pair of single sided 5 inch floppy disk drive; a 20Mb Hard disk drive version was available towards the end of the product&#x27;s life. The operating system was CP/M or a proprietary variant CP*, and the unit was supplied with a suite of applications, consisting of a word processor, spreadsheet, database and a semi-compiled basic programming language. The display supplied with the unit (both the &quot;Teleputer 1&quot; and &quot;3&quot;) was a modified Rediffusion 14 inch portable colour television, with the tuner circuitry removed and being driven by a RGB input. The unit had a 64Kb onboard memory which could be expanded to 128Kb with a plug in card. Graphics were the standard videotext (or teletext) resolution and colour, but a high resolution graphic card was also available. A 75/1200 baud modem was fitted as standard (could also run at 300/300 and 1200/1200), and connected to the telephone via an old style round telephone connector. In addition an IEEE interface card could be fitted. On the back of the unit there was a RS-232 and Centronics connections and on the front was the connector for the keyboard.

The proposed &quot;Teleputer 4&quot; &amp; &quot;5&quot; were planned to have a laser disk attached and would allow the units to control video output on a separate screen.

=== Spain ===
In Spain the system was provided by the Telefónica company and called Ibertex, which was adopted from the French Minitel system, but using the German CEPT-1 standard, used in the German Bildschirmtext.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, the Department of Communications started a lengthy development program in the late 1970s that led to a graphical &quot;second generation&quot; service known as Telidon. Telidon was able to deliver service using the vertical blanking interval of a TV signal or completely by telephone using a Bell 202 style (split baud rate 150/1200) modem. The TV signal was used in a similar fashion to Ceefax, but used more of the available signal (due to differences in the signals between North America and Europe) for a data rate about 1200-bit/s. Some TV signal systems used a low-speed modem on the phone line for menu operation. The resulting system was rolled out in several test studies, all of which were failures.

The use of the 202 model modem, rather than one compatible with the existing DATAPAC dial-up points such as the Bell 212, created severe limitations, as it made use of the nationwide X.25 packet network essentially out-of-bounds for Telidon-based services. There were also many widely held misperceptions concerning the graphics resolution and colour resolution that slowed business acceptance. Byte magazine once described it as &quot;low resolution&quot;, when the coding system was, in fact, capable of 224 resolution in 8-byte mode. There was also a pronounced emphasis in government and Telco circles on &quot;hardware decoding&quot; even after very capable PC-based software decoders became readily available. This emphasis on special single-purpose hardware was yet another impediment to the widespread adoption of the system.

Services included:

* Grassroots Canada by InfoMart, Toronto
* Teleguide, A kiosk-based service emphasizing tourist information in Toronto by InfoMart, and in San Francisco by The Chronicle, in Phoenix by The Arizona Republic and in Las Vegas by The Las Vegas Sun.

NAPLPS-based systems (Teleguide) were also used for an interactive Mall directory system in various locations, including the world&#x27;s largest indoor mall, West Edmonton Mall (1985) and the Toronto Eaton Center. It was also used for an interactive multipoint audio-graphic educational teleconferencing system (1987) that predated today&#x27;s shared interactive whiteboard systems such as those used by Blackboard and Desire2Learn.

=== United States ===

One of the earliest experiments with marketing videotex to consumers in the U.S. was by Radio Shack, which sold a consumer videotex terminal, essentially a single-purpose predecessor to the TRS-80 Color Computer, in outlets across the country. Sales were anemic. Radio Shack later sold a videotex software and hardware package for the Color Computer.

In an attempt to capitalize on the European experience, a number of US-based media firms started their own videotex systems in the early 1980s. Among them were Knight-Ridder, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and Field Enterprises in Chicago, which launched Keyfax. The &quot;Fort Worth Star-Telegram&quot; partnered with Radio Shack to launch StarText (Radio Shack was headquartered in Fort Worth).

Unlike the UK, however, the FCC refused to set a single technical standard, so each provider could choose what it wished. Some selected Telidon (now standardized as NAPLPS) but the majority decided to use slight-modified versions of the Prestel hardware. StarText used proprietary software developed at the Star-Telegram. Rolled out across the country from 1982 to 1984, all of the services quickly died. None, except StarText, remained in operation after two years from their respective launch dates. StarText remained in operation until the late 1990s, when it was moved to the web.

The primary problem was that the systems were simply too slow, operating on 300 baud modems connected to large minicomputers. After waiting several seconds for the data to be sent, users then had to scroll up and down to view the articles. Searching and indexing was not provided, so users often had to download long lists of titles before they could download the article itself. Furthermore, most of the same information was available in easy-to-use TV format on the air, or in general reference books at the local library, and didn&#x27;t tie up a landline. Unlike the Ceefax system where the signal was available for free in every TV, many U.S. systems cost hundreds of dollars to install, plus monthly fees of $30 or more.

The most successful online services of the period were not videotex services at all. Despite the promises that videotex would appeal to the mass market, the videotex services were comfortably out-distanced by Dow Jones News/Retrieval (begun in 1973), CompuServe and (somewhat further behind) The Source, both begun in 1979. None were videotex services, nor did they use the fixed frame-by-frame videotex model for content. Instead all three used search functions and text interfaces to deliver files that were for the most part plain ASCII. Other ASCII-based services that became popular included Delphi (launched in 1983) and GEnie (launched in 1985).

Nevertheless, NAPLPS-based services were developed by several other joint partnerships between 1983 and 1987. These included:

* Viewtron, a joint venture of Knight-Ridder and AT&amp;T
* Gateway, A service in Southern California by a joint venture of Times Mirror and InfoMart of Canada 
* Keyfax, A service in Chicago by Field Enterprises and Centel
* Covidea, based in New York, set up by AT&amp;T and Chemical Bank, with Time Inc. and Bank of America

A joint venture of AT&amp;T-CBS completed a moderately successful trial of videotex use in the homes of Ridgewood, New Jersey, leveraging technology developed at Bell Labs. After the trial in Ridgewood AT&amp;T and CBS parted company. Subsequently, CBS partnered with IBM and Sears, Roebuck, and Company to form Trintex. Around 1985, this entity began to offer a service called Prodigy, which used NAPLPS to send information to its users, right up until it turned into an Internet service provider in the late 1990s. Because of its relatively late debut, Prodigy was able to skip the intermediate step of persuading American consumers to attach proprietary boxes to their televisions; it was among the earliest proponents of computer-based videotex.

Videotex technology was also adopted for use internally within organizations. Digital Equipment Corp (DEC) offered a videotex product (VTX) on the VAX system. Goldman Sachs, for one, adopted and developed an internal fixed income information distribution and bond sales system based on DEC VTX. Internal systems were overtaken by external vendors, notably Bloomberg, which offered the additional benefit of providing information from different firms and allowing interactive communication between the firms.

One of the earliest corporations to participate in videotex in the United States was American Express. Its service, branded &quot;American Express ADVANCE&quot; included card account info, travel booking, stock prices from Shearson Lehman, and even online shopping, through its Merchandise Services division.

=== Australia ===
Australia&#x27;s national public Videotex service, Viatel, was launched by Telecom Australia on 28 February 1985. It was based on the British Prestel service. The service was later renamed Discovery 40, in reference to its 40 column screen format, as well as to distinguish it from another Telecom service, Discovery 80. According to an article in a 1986 edition of the &quot;Viatel Directory And Magazine&quot;, the Viatel system had a rapid take up in its first year.

=== New Zealand ===
A private service known as TAARIS (Travel Agents Association Reservation and Information Service) was launched in New Zealand in 1985 for the Travel Agents Association of New Zealand by ICL Computers. This service used ICL&#x27;s proprietary &quot;Bulletin&quot; software which was based on the &quot;Prestel&quot;standard but provided many additional facilities such as the ability to run additional software for specific applications. It also supported a proprietary email service.

===Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, the then state-owned phone company PTT (now KPN) operated two platforms: Viditel (launched in 1980) and Videotex Nederland. From the user perspective the main difference between these systems was that Viditel used standard dial-in phone numbers where Videotex used premium-rate telephone numbers. For Viditel you needed a (paid) subscription and on top of that you paid for each page you visited. For Videotex services you normally didn&#x27;t need a subscription nor was there the need to authenticate: you paid for the services via the premium rate of the modem-connection based on connection time, regardless of the pages or services you retrieved.

From the information-provider point of view, there were huge differences between Viditel and Videotex: Via Viditel all data was normally stored on the central computer(s) owned and managed by KPN: to update the information in the system you connected to the Viditel computer and via a terminal-emulation application you could edit the information.

But when using Videotex the information is on a computer-platform owned and managed by the information-provider. The Videotex system connected the end-user to the Datanet 1 line of the information-provider. It was up to the information provider if the access-point (the box directly behind the telephone line) supported the videotex protocol or that it was a &quot;transparent&quot; connection where the host handled the protocol.

As said the Videotex Nederland services offered access via several primary rate numbers and the information/service provider could choose the costs for accessing his service. Depending on the number used, the tariff could vary from ƒ 0,00 to ƒ 1,00 Dutch guilders (which is between €0.00 and €0.45 euro) per minute.

Besides these public available services, generally without authentication, there were also several private services using the same infrastructure but using their own access-phone numbers and dedicated access-points. As these services weren&#x27;t public you had to log into the infrastructure. The largest private networks were &quot;Travelnet&quot; which was an information and booking-system for the travel industry and &quot;RDWNet,&quot; which was set up for the automobile trade to register the outcome of MOT tests to the agency that officially issued the test-report. Later, some additional services for the branch were added such as a service where the readings of the odometer could be registered each time a car was brought in for service. This was part of the &quot;Nationale Autopas Service&quot; and is now available via internet

The network of Videotex Nederland offered also direct access to most services of the French minitel system.

===Ireland===
A version of the French Minitel system was introduced to Ireland by eircom (then called Telecom Éireann) in 1988. The system was based on the French model and Irish services were even accessible from France via the code &quot;3619 Irlande.&quot;

A number of major Irish businesses came together to offer a range of online services, including directory information, shopping, banking, hotel reservations, airline reservations, news, weather and information services. It wasn&#x27;t a centralised service and individual service providers could connect to it via the Eirpac packet switching network. It could also connect to databases on other networks such as French Minitel services, European databases and university systems.
The system was also the first platform in Ireland to offer users access to e-mail outside of a corporate setting. Despite being cutting edge for its time, the system failed to capture a large market and was ultimately withdrawn due to lack of commercial interest. The rise of the internet and other global online services in the early to mid-1990s played a major factor in the death of Irish Minitel. The service eventually ended by the end of the 1990s..

Minitel Ireland&#x27;s terminals were technically identical to their French counterparts, except that they had a QWERTY keyboard and an RJ-11 telephone jack which is the standard telephone connector in Ireland. Terminals could be rented for 5.00 Irish pounds (6.35 euro) per month or purchased for 250.00 Irish pounds (317.43 euro) in 1992.

===Minitel===

With the French Minitel system, unlike any other service, the users were given an entire custom designed terminal for free. This was a deliberate move on the part of France Telecom, which reasoned that it would be cheaper in the long run to give away free terminals and teach its customers how to look up telephone listings on the terminal, instead of continuing to print and ship millions of phone books each year.

Once the network was in place, commercial services started to sprout up, becoming very popular in the mid-1980s. By 1990 tens of millions of terminals were in use. Like Prestel, Minitel used an asymmetric modem (1200-bit/s for downloading information to the terminal and 75-bit/s back).

===Alex===

Bell Canada introduced Minitel to Quebec as Alex in 1988, and Ontario two years later. It was available both as a standalone CRT terminal (very similar in design to the ADM-3A) with 1200-bit/s modem, and as software-only for MS-DOS computers. The system was received enthusiastically thanks to a free two-month introductory period, but fizzled within two years. Online fees were very high, and the useful services such as home banking, restaurant reservations, and news feeds, that Bell Canada advertised did not materialise; within a very short time the majority of content on Alex was of poor quality or very expensive chat lines. The Alex terminals did double duty for connecting to text-only BBSes.

===Minitel in Brazil===
A very successful system was started in São Paulo, Brazil, by then state-owned Telesp (Telecomunicações de São Paulo). It was called Videotexto and operated from 1982 to the mid-nineties; a few other state telephone companies followed Telesp&#x27;s lead, but each state kept standalone databases and services. The key to its success was that the phone company offered only the service and phone subscriber databases and third parties—banks, database providers, newspapers—offered additional content and services. The system peaked at 70 thousand subscribers around 1995.

===South Africa===

Beltel was launched by Telkom in the mid-eighties and continued until 1999.

==Comparison to the Internet today==
While some people consider videotex to be the precursor of the Internet, the two technologies evolved separately and reflect fundamentally different assumptions about how to computerize communications.

The Internet in its mature form (after 1990) is highly decentralized in that it is essentially a federation of thousands of service providers whose mutual cooperation makes everything run, more or less. Furthermore, the various hardware and software components of the Internet are designed, manufactured and supported by thousands of different companies. Thus, completing any given task on the Internet, such as retrieving a webpage, relies on the contributions of hundreds of people at a hundred or more distinct companies, each of which may have only very tenuous connections with each other.

In contrast, videotex was always highly centralized (except in the French Minitel service, also including thousands of information providers running their own servers connected to the packet switched network &quot;TRANSPAC&quot;). Even in videotex networks where third-party companies could post their own content and operate special services like forums, a single company usually owned and operated the underlying communications network, developed and deployed the necessary hardware and software, and billed both content providers and users for access. The exception was the transaction processing videotex system developed in the UK by Michael Aldrich in 1979, which brought teleshopping (or online shopping as it was later called) into prominence and was the idea developed later through the Internet. Aldrich&#x27;s systems were based on minicomputers that could communicate with multiple mainframes. Many systems were installed in the UK including the world&#x27;s first supermarket teleshopping system.

Nearly all books and articles (in English) from videotex&#x27;s heyday (the late 1970s and early 1980s) seem to reflect a common assumption that in any given videotex system, there would be a single company that would build and operate the network. Although this appears shortsighted in retrospect, it is important to realize that communications had been perceived as a natural monopoly for almost a century — indeed, in much of the world, telephone networks were then and still are explicitly operated as a government monopoly. The Internet as we know it today was still in its infancy in the 1970s, and was mainly operated on telephone lines owned by AT&amp;T which were leased by ARPA. At the time, AT&amp;T did not take seriously the threat posed by packet switching; it actually turned down the opportunity to take over ARPANET. Other computer networks at the time were not really decentralized; for example, the private network Tymnet had central control computers called supervisors which controlled each other in an automatically determined hierarchy. It would take another decade of hard work to transform the Internet from an academic toy into the basis for a modern information utility.

==Definitions==

Definitions of Videotex and associated terms. These definitions were written in 1980 so some names may be out of date.

* Videotex: A two-way interactive service. The term was coined by CCITT and emphasizes information retrieved with the capability of displaying pages of text and pictorial material on the screens of adapted TVs.
* Viewdata: An alternative term to videotex, used in particular by the British Post Office and generally in Britain and the USA. Elsewhere, the term videotex is preferred. Viewdata was coined by the BPO in the early 1970s, but found to be unacceptable as a trade name, hence its use as a generic.
* Teletext: One-way broadcast information services for displaying pages of text and pictorial material on the screens of adapted TVs. A limited choice of information pages is continuously cycled at the broadcasting station. By means of a keypad, a user can select one page at a time for display from the cycle. The information is transmitted in digital form usually using spare capacity in the broadcast TV signal. Careful design can ensure that there is no interference with the normal TV picture. Alternatively, it can use the full capacity of a dedicated channel. Compared with two-way videotex, teletext is inherently more limited, though generally less costly.
* Teletex: A text communication standard for communicating word processors and similar terminals combining the facilities of office typewriters and text editing.
* Ceefax (&quot;See facts&quot;): The BBC&#x27;s name for its public teletext service available on two TV channels using spare capacity.
* Oracle (&quot;Optional recognition of coded line electronics&quot;): The name of the IBA&#x27;s equivalent teletext service.
* Bildschirmtext, DataVision, Bulletin, Captain, Teletel, Prestel, Viewtron, etc.: The proprietary names for specific videotex implementations.

<text>Spencer is a city in the state of Iowa, United States, and the county seat of Clay County. It is located at the confluence of the Little Sioux and Ocheyedan rivers. The population was 11,325 in the 2020 census, an increase from 11,317 in 2000. Spencer hosts the Clay County Fair, held annually in September and averaging more than 300,000 visitors.

The town&#x27;s late library cat, Dewey Readmore Books, became known throughout the world before his death in 2006. He was immortalized in the book &quot;&quot; by Vicki Myron, director of the library, and Bret Witter.

==History==
When Clay County was established in 1851, it had no local government and official business was done out of Sergeant&#x27;s Bluff, nearly 100 miles away on the Missouri River. In 1859, Judge Hubbard of Iowa&#x27;s 4th Judicial District authorized a committee to find a site for the county seat. This committee selected &quot;Section 20 of Spencer Township&quot;, located roughly in the center of the county near the confluence of &quot;Sioux River and Ocheydan Creek&quot;, as the site for the &quot;seat of justice&quot;. County Judge Charles Smeltzer approved their plan and began signing documents with the location &quot;Spencer, Clay County, Iowa&quot;, even though he was not physically there. A small group of land speculators had cleared the area and laid out a town plan, but there were no people living in that area at the time. Most of Clay County&#x27;s residents were living in Peterson Township, in the far southeastern corner of the county. Put to a vote, Peterson was chosen as the County Seat and a courthouse erected there. The site of the proposed town languished, uninhabited, for many years, the area coming to be called &quot;Spencer Grove&quot;.

The first settlers in what is now Spencer arrived in Emmetsburg in the Winter of 1865. Most of the men were Union veterans of the Civil War from Wisconsin and were claiming land under the Homestead Act of 1862. While in Emmetburg, they were told of Spencer Grove and decided it would make a nice place to establish their homesteads. The town site was platted by John Franklin Calkins. He and his family and some other families arrived in Spencer Grove in May 1866 and were joined by another wave of settlers later that summer. On September 20, 1866, Spencer Grove Township was formally organized; one of the benefits was the residents being able to vote locally rather than traveling twenty miles to Peterson, the County Seat and only incorporated town in Clay County. In October 1866, Spencer Grove resident Romanzo Coates was elected as Superintendent of Clay County Common Schools; he established the first schoolhouse on the upper level of his cabin and appointed his wife as the first schoolteacher.

In 1868, the US Postal Service authorized a post office to be established at Spencer Grove. The authorization came with the caveat that there already was a &quot;Spencer Grove&quot; in Iowa, so they needed to change the name; the residents opted to drop &quot;Grove&quot; and henceforth the name of the town was simply &quot;Spencer&quot;. Romanzo Coates, already the superintendent of schools, was also made the town&#x27;s first postmaster, with his cabin used as the first post office.

In 1869, Garrett Marcellus moved to Spencer and established a mill on the Little Sioux River about one mile downstream. This was Spencer&#x27;s first real business outside of the goods being sold out of J.W. Masten&#x27;s cabin. Several businesses soon followed: Peeso &amp; Burgin&#x27;s General Store and Tuttle &amp; Smith both opened in 1870, as did a wagon shop, butcher shop and a blacksmith.

The plat for the Town of Spencer was filed on May 8, 1871 and approved by Judge Snyder of Iowa&#x27;s 4th District Court. This marks the official founding of Spencer, Iowa. That year also saw the addition of several more businesses, including a hotel and hardware store.

By this time, the population around Spencer had surpassed that of Peterson, the County Seat located in the far southeastern corner of the county. A petition was passed to move the seat to the more centrally located Spencer; the motion passed 359–200 and in October 1871, the seat of government for Clay County was moved from Peterson to Spencer. At the time, Spencer lacked any building suitable for a courthouse, so residents pooled money and talent to build a two-story, 20x40 building on Main Street. This was subsequently purchased by the county for $1333 and used as the courthouse.

Between June and September 1878, the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St Paul Railway built a line west from Algona to Spencer. The line was completed in mid-September and regular service began on September 15. Along with the rail road came telegraph service, the poles having been constructed alongside the tracks.

Spencer was formally incorporated as the Town of Spencer on March 26, 1880, with a mayor and board of trustees. On March 21, 1892, it was re-incorporated as the City of Spencer, with a mayor and city council.

In 1899, growth was stimulated by construction of the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway to the settlement. The county seat operated as a trading center for a county devoted to farming. The railroad carried crops and products into and out of the area.

A 1931 fire, ignited by a dropped sparkler, destroyed more than 100 buildings in the town. Using the case of the Spencer Fire along with the Remsen Fire of 1936, the state legislature banned almost all fireworks until 2017, when a relaxed law was passed. As of yet, Spencer has not authorized fireworks sale or use in the city. (Exception: During the legal periods, one can apply for a permit to sell.)

===2024 flooding===

On June 22, 2024, a massive flood, which submerged much of the city, and a power outage for almost a full month, it began when both the Little Sioux and Ocheyedan rivers overflowed due to heavy rainfall.

The floods damaged over 2,500 homes and businesses with at least 1,000 beyond repair. Many Spencer residents were left homeless in the aftermath. One man was killed. The flooding here was the result of a larger system of storms that saw roughly 4–6 inches of rain dumped on various counties in northwest Iowa, southeastern South Dakota and southern Minnesota in a 24-hour period.

Clay County received approximately 14 total inches of rain the week of the flooding. 4.76 of those came the night of June 22. 

On June 24, President Joe Biden approved a request for a disaster declaration in the state of Iowa which would allocate federal funds for flood victims in Clay, Emmet, Kossuth, Plymouth and Sioux Counties. 

According to Spencer Fire Chief Jesse Coulson, firefighters rescued at least 383 people from the floodwaters but added that the number could easily be as high as 700 as not all water rescues were documented. Numerous individuals were pulled from their rooftops via helicopter.

On June 30, workers from FEMA began canvassing Clay County and working with homeowners affected by the floods.

<text>Guttenberg is a city in Clayton County, Iowa, United States, along the Mississippi River. The population was 1,817 at the time of the 2020 census, down from 1,987 at the 2000 census.

== History ==
Prairie La Porte, meaning &quot;the door to the prairie,&quot; was the first name given to Guttenberg by French explorers in 1673. The Guttenberg area was a site of Sac and Fox campgrounds until 1823. The Louisiana Purchase of 1803 transferred ownership to the United States and the Black Hawk Purchase of 1833 finally opened the area for legal settlement.

Guttenberg&#x27;s past is preserved today in the many limestone buildings built by German immigrants in the mid-to-late 19th century. These structures were used for both residential and commercial purposes. Many such as the Albertus Building are pre–Civil War era and are preserved in the Front Street Historic District.
Guttenberg&#x27;s riverfront location was pivotal in its early commercial development. The town first served as a focal point for westward settlement and as an early governmental and administrative center. It was the early location of the county seat from 1838 to 1843. Guttenberg served as a supply center for the general area until the Civil War, when railroads and an interior road system combined to detract from Guttenberg&#x27;s role as a market center.

The earliest businesses included general supply stores, blacksmith, wagon shops, and hotels. The loss of the county seat in 1843 slowed growth and the population declined. Economic revival began in 1845 with the influx of hundreds of German immigrants under the auspices of the Western Settlement Society of Cincinnati and continued with the development of the lead mining industry along Miners Creek.

The German immigration began in 1845, and by 1850 the town was sizable and nearly all German. The city takes its name from Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of movable type. Many of the town&#x27;s streets are named for 18th &amp; 19th century German writers, poets, playwrights and philosophers such as Koerner, Herman, Weiland, Lessing, Schiller, Herder and Goethe, whose writings became prolific in Germany because of Johannes Gutenberg&#x27;s invention. A replica of a Bible Gutenberg printed is on display at the public library.

Guttenberg incorporated in 1851. The influence of the German population was best indicated by the construction during the period between 1845 and 1865 for over one hundred stone buildings. The bluff limestone was easily obtained and good, local clay and lime for construction was available. Four large riverside warehouses opened and a large flour mill, stores, and hotels appeared during this period. The steamboat trade deposited merchandise and picked up farm produce, milled flour and lead ore.

Guttenberg experienced many floods, the most recent and devastating being in 1965, after which a levee was built. Today, Guttenberg&#x27;s population is 1,817 and it is the largest town in Clayton County.

<text>Marquette is a city in Clayton County, Iowa, United States. The population was 429 at the time of the 2020 census, up from 421 in 2000. The city, which is located on the Mississippi River, is named after Jesuit missionary Jacques Marquette, who along with Louis Joliet discovered the Mississippi River just southeast of the city on June 17, 1673.

==History==
Marquette is located directly across from Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, and the two cities are connected by U.S. Route 18, which crosses the river on the Marquette-Joliet Bridge. Effigy Mounds National Monument and the Yellow River State Forest are a few miles to the north. The city of McGregor is located just to the south. Marquette itself was originally incorporated as North McGregor in 1874, and it served as a railroad terminus for its southern neighbor.

Along with McGregor, the city became a major hub on the railroad, as grain from throughout Iowa and Minnesota was sent through the city en route to Lake Michigan. Initially trains had to be ferried across the river between Marquette and Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, in order to continue their journey, but this system came to an end when Prairie du Chien businessman John Lawler had a permanent pontoon bridge built to connect the two cities&#x27; rail lines. Marquette subsequently became home to a major rail yard, which even as late as 1920 was the busiest in Iowa, employing 400 people. Not too long afterwards, the railroad&#x27;s significance declined, the last passenger train stopped in Marquette in 1960, and the pontoon bridge was disassembled in 1961. Today the city is a tourist destination along the mighty Mississippi River.

==Geography==

<doc id="112912" wikidata="Q281585" url="?curid=112912" title="McGregor, Iowa">
<text>McGregor is a city in Clayton County, Iowa, United States. The population was 742 at the time of the 2020 census. McGregor is located on the Mississippi River across from Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin. Pike&#x27;s Peak State Park is located just south of the city. Just to the north of McGregor is the city of Marquette. The community of McGregor Heights lies in the southern parts of the city limits.

==History==
McGregor was founded as MacGregor&#x27;s Landing in 1847 by Alexandar MacGregor, a descendant of Rob Roy MacGregor, and the area around MacGregor&#x27;s Landing was settled by the extended family. In 1849 it was reported that the original MacGregor seal and signet were owned by Alex MacGregor. The Scots Gaelic clan seal was inscribed, &quot;S&#x27; Riogal Mo Dhream/ Een dhn bait spair nocht&quot;, which was interpreted as &quot;Royalty is my race / End do and spare not&quot;. The signet was a bloodstone from Loch Lomond, and was sketched by William Williams.

Since 1837, MacGregor had been operating a ferry across the Mississippi River between Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin and the present site of McGregor, Iowa. MacGregor planned the new city as a six block development, and it was quickly populated, being incorporated as McGregor in 1857. In that same year, the Milwaukee &amp; Mississippi Railroad finished building a railroad track from Milwaukee, Wisconsin to Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, thus connecting Lake Michigan with the Mississippi River by rail. McGregor quickly became a major commercial center, and served as a hub where grain from Iowa and Minnesota could be transported across the Mississippi and sent on to Milwaukee via railroad. For example, around 1860, Joseph &quot;Diamond Jo&quot; Reynolds moved to McGregor in order to establish a grain trading business, and later ran his own steam packets. The Diamond Jo office building still stands in the city. More railroads were built to connect McGregor with cities further west, and the city of North McGregor (now Marquette, Iowa) was established just north of the city to serve as the city&#x27;s railroad terminus. After reaching McGregor from the west, trains were disassembled and railroad cars were ferried across the Mississippi to continue on towards Lake Michigan.

The towns early residents made use of the bedrock to carve cellars into the soft sandstone, used for cold storage and ageing beer; as of 1997 most of the entryways are visible but inaccessible.

In 1874, the system of ferrying railroad cars across the river between North McGregor and Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, was brought to an end when Prairie du Chien businessman John Lawler commissioned the construction of a permanent pontoon bridge to connect the two cities&#x27; rail lines. As the need for men to disassemble and ship trains across the river disappeared, the city&#x27;s population began to decline.

The city&#x27;s history is preserved in the McGregor Commercial Historic District, which contains many buildings constructed during the city&#x27;s boom years. Because of its colorful history and location beside the Mississippi River, the city has become a popular summer tourist destination, and it is known for its many antique stores.

The city was heavily damaged during a storm on July 19, 2017, with the downtown area being particularly hard hit.

<text>Calamus () is a small town in Clinton County, Iowa, United States, located on the historical Lincoln Highway, which was the first transcontinental highway for automobiles across the U.S..
Calamus is the only town in Olive Township and had a population of 356 at the 2020 census, which was a 9.6% decrease from 2000. Calamus was named after Calamus Creek, which received its name from the great quantities of sweet flag growing in it, derived from the botanical name &quot;Acorus calamus&quot;, commonly called Sweet Flag or Calamus.

==History==

===Early settlement===

In July 1858 the first railroad was built west from Clinton to Clarence, Iowa. It was called the Chicago, Iowa and Nebraska Railroad, later changed to Chicago Northwestern Railroad Co.. In the same year, Joseph D. Fegan was deputized to go to the cross roads of the Stage Coach Lines and the Indian Trails at Syracuse, which had a small stove and a saloon, to establish a post office in 1858. No one could suggest a name and Mr. Fegan asked &quot;Is there no creek or anything?&quot; &quot;Yes, Calamus Creek.&quot; &quot;Then let it be Calamus.&quot; Due to the large hazardous swamps, the Post Office and railway station were moved to a more favorable location in what is now the town of Calamus.

The present day location of Calamus, a small village on the Union Pacific Railway, was platted in 1860 by R. S. Dickinson, who owned the land on the north side of the railroad, and Col. Milo Smith, who owned that on the south. James Keith opened the first store here containing a small stock of groceries and accessories, located about where the present day Faith Lutheran Church stands. In 1861, R. S. Dickinson and his son A. L. built the first general store, and opened a large and complete stock of general merchandise, and engaged in grain-buying. Two or three years later, another small store was opened by R. E. Houck.

Thomas Franklin Butterfield built the first grain elevator, to care for the grain which had previously been hauled to Davenport. In 1868, two elevators had a thriving business and there were four general stores.

The first hotel was built in the early 1860s and burned down in 1912. This building was located on the S.W. corner of 2nd and Railroad Streets and the first landlord was William Wick. Later the &quot;Commercial Hotel&quot; was erected on 2nd St. on the north half of Lot 6. This hotel had a livery stable and A.H. Danforth was the proprietor.

The town was replatted October 9, 1865, by Milo Smith and R. S. and Emily Dickinson.

Calamus was legally incorporated in 1876 [October 6, 1875.], and E. F. Owens was elected the first Mayor. His successors have been F. Buck, in 1877, and J. C. Bowman, in 1878 and 1879. The city limits were enlarged in 1913.

===Civil War===
The vote in the Olive Township in 1860 was 149, and before the draft for the Civil War was ordered, 79 men volunteered into the Union Army. This was the &#x27;banner&#x27; township of Iowa regarding enlistments in proportion to the population. The last survivor of the Civil War was Jacob W. Liebler, who died in 1941.

==Geography==
Calamus is located at (41.826669, -90.759793). in Olive Township.

==Education==
The Calamus–Wheatland Community School District operates public schools serving the community. The district was established on July 1, 1990, by the merger of the Calamus and Wheatland school districts. Calamus–Wheatland High School in Wheatland is a comprehensive four year high school.

The first school in town was built before 1876. It was a one-room log building located on the present site of the Rose Hill Cemetery. Long benches were used as seats, long boards as desks, and a table served as the teachers desk. Miss Julia Cook (Ferren) was the first teacher. Later a white frame building was erected south of the railroad tracks. In 1902 a red brick building was erected at the same location, at the cost of $3,000. For the school year of 1909–10, the county superintendent report to the state superintendent of schools stated that Calamus had one male and two female teachers and an attendance of 78.
In 1919, it was voted to consolidate with several country school districts, and school buses were purchased. They were Model T Fords with no heat and the seats were lengthwise on both sides of the bus. The upstairs of the McCarthy building was used for the High School and the grades were housed in the old school. During the school year of 1920–21, a classroom was located in the Methodist Church and on the stage of the Auditorium. On May 17, 1921, the first graduation exercises were held in the new school, which was nearing completion, and on the same day dedication of the school was held. The next fall, school was held in the new building. The building is located at the south end of 2nd St. and was erected at a cost of $100,000. The school board members at that time were C. A. Blake, President; Hans Johnson; Wm. F. Siegmund; Jonathan Hayes, Jr. and Eli Olson. The district was known as the Calamus Consolidated School.

On May 3, 1946, marking the end of the 27 yr. period of indebtedness, the mortgage deed of the Calamus Consolidated School was burned at a ceremony in the school auditorium.

In 1950, six rooms and a large gymnasium were added at a cost of $125,000. In 1964, another six rooms were added at a cost of $196,000. The vote on the bond issue for the construction of this addition carried by 92.8%, an all-time high in the state of Iowa.

==Media==
Calamus has not had many home printed newspapers.

The first paper that was issued in Calamus was established by H. L. Barter and was called the &quot;Free Press&quot;. After some time, F. L. Sunderlin, later of the &quot;Delmar Journal&quot;, associated himself with Barter and the paper was continued under the name of &quot;Barter and Sunderlin&quot;. It did not have a very long existence and for various reasons it suspended publication.

Whip and Cook printed a newspaper here in the 1880s. It also had a very brief existence.

The &quot;Calamus Record&quot; was the latest newspaper venture for Calamus. It was established in 1901 by A. J. Gault and enjoyed a longer existence than the other newspapers.

==Parks and recreation==
Calamus has 4 county parks:

*Sherman Park 
*Syracuse Wildlife area
*Ringneck Marsh Wildlife Management Area
*Mockridge County Wildlife Preserve

===Water trails - canoeing and kayaking===

==Religion==

===Wesley United Methodist Church===

The first church built in Calamus was the Methodist Church built in 1869. Two-by-twelve planks were used for seating, supplemented by a few chairs. In 1870, a choir loft was added to the south of the building, also a belfry and bell, and the planks were replaced by 175 chairs. The church was painted inside and out. In 1906, this building was torn down and a new one erected of white brick with Gothic windows and frosted panes at a cost of approximately $3,000. Later, a basement was put under the Church for social activities and electricity was installed in 1917. Prior to that, lighting was done with carbide lights. This building burned November 4, 1927. Dedication of the new and present structure was held September 8, 1929. It is in use today under the name of Wesley United Methodist Church.

===Calamus Lutheran Parish===
The Calamus Lutheran Parish consists of two congregations, Our Savior’s Kvindherred Lutheran Church (Calamus, Iowa) and Faith Lutheran Church. While they are two individual congregations with individual histories, Our Savior&#x27;s and Faith have some history in common. This began in 1853 when the eighth Norwegian settlement in Iowa was started in Olive Township of Clinton County. Those wishing to form a worshipping community selected a site southeast of Calamus to build their church. The first congregational records were dated December 27, 1861. However, congregational activities had begun before that date. In 1865 a school was built. The name Kvindherred was the region in Norway from which the settlers had come. By 1877, the Kvindherred Lutheran Church was erected. In 1946, the name was changed to Our Savior&#x27;s.

In 1947, discussion was started as to building a new church or remodeling the existing church. Decisions were difficult to make. One group remained in the country and remodeled the existing church. Another group, together with the pastor, left to form a congregation in the town of Calamus.

Faith Lutheran Church was officially organized on July 7, 1950. A parsonage was donated as well as adjoining lots to construct a new building. Faith Lutheran Church was officially accepted into the Evangelical Lutheran Church Synod on June 6, 1951.

In 1972, a cooperative ministry was established between Faith and Our Savior&#x27;s. One pastor serves both churches.
