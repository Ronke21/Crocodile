<text>Fayetteville () is the second-most populous city in the U.S. state of Arkansas, the county seat of Washington County, and the most populous city in Northwest Arkansas. The city had a population of 93,949 as of the 2020 census, which was estimated to have increased to 101,680 by 2023. The city is on the outskirts of the Boston Mountains, within the Ozarks. It was named after Fayetteville, Tennessee, from which many settlers had come, and was incorporated on November 3, 1836. Fayetteville is included in the three-county Fayetteville–Springdale–Rogers metropolitan statistical area, with 576,403 residents in 2020.

Fayetteville is home to the University of Arkansas, the state&#x27;s flagship university. When classes are in session, thousands of students on campus change up the pace of the city. Thousands of Arkansas Razorbacks alumni and fans travel to Fayetteville to attend football, basketball, and baseball games.

The city is the first in America to be awarded the designation of &quot;Bike City&quot; by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), the world governing body of cycling. It was given the title in 2021 due to it not only hosting major UCI cycling events, but also its work in developing cycling through programs and infrastructure. The city hosts Walmart&#x27;s shareholders meetings each year at Bud Walton Arena.

==History==

===Settlement through Antebellum period===

In 1828, George McGarrah settled at Big Spring with his family on the modern day corner of Spring and Willow, founding the town of Washington, and starting work on the courthouse. On October 17, Washington County was established, Washington chosen as the county seat. The Washington Courthouse was finished in 1829, and also contained the post office. Later in the year Postmaster Larkin Newton changed the name to the Fayetteville Courthouse, to avoid confusing with Washington, Hempstead County. Two councilmen selected to name the city were from Fayetteville, Tennessee, which was itself named for Fayetteville, North Carolina (where some of its earliest residents had lived before moving to Tennessee). That original Fayetteville was named for General Lafayette, a French general who helped the colonies gain independence in the American Revolutionary War.

The first store in Fayetteville was opened by John Nye in a small building constructed by James Holmsley. In 1832 David Walker, Chief Justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court, built a double log cabin on what is now Center Street. In 1822 Archibald Yell, the second Governor of Arkansas, built a house and called it &quot;Waxhaw&quot; after his home in North Carolina. The house was on the outskirts of town then but now the area has a street named after him which connects College and School streets. The first hotels were the Burnside House and the Onstott House. Fayetteville was incorporated as a town on November 3, 1836.

In 1859, a city charter was obtained from the Legislature. During the American Civil War the municipal government was suspended and was not reinstated until 1867. P.V. Rhea was the president of the town trustees in 1836; J.W. Walker was the first mayor under the charter of 1859, and M.L. Harrison was the first mayor when the government was reorganized in 1867. The telegraph came to Fayetteville in 1860, strung along Military Road from St. Louis, Missouri, to Little Rock, Arkansas.

===Civil War and Reconstruction===

During the Civil War, Union General Samuel Ryan Curtis occupied Fayetteville on February 18, 1862, and the next week, the Battle of Pea Ridge was fought northeast of Fayetteville. The city housed wounded soldiers from the Battle of Prairie Grove in December 1862, and housed injured troops on Dickson Street. Confederate troops besieged Union soldiers in Fayetteville during the Battle of Fayetteville on April 18, 1863, at the present-day intersection of College Avenue (U.S. Route 71B) and Dickson Street, and at the Union headquarters. Union soldiers held the city against cannon fire and cavalry attacks, although their headquarters sustained damage. 

The building was restored and is operated as the Headquarters House, a museum of the Washington County Historical Society. Fayetteville was occupied from December 1862 until May 1865 (except May–September 1863) by the First Arkansas Union Cavalry, a regiment of Union men from Northwest Arkansas. Union forces repelled a Confederate attack in October 1864. After the war, the United States government established the Fayetteville National Cemetery in 1867. A cemetery for Confederate dead was founded in 1873.
Newspapers were established early; in 1859, Elias Cornelius Boudinot, a young half-Cherokee attorney, and James Pettigrew founded &quot;The Arkansan.&quot; The &quot;Fayetteville Weekly Democrat&quot; began publishing in 1868. It later became the &quot;Northwest Arkansas Times&quot; and is still in print today. The Fayetteville Schools District was founded on March 20, 1871, as the first independent school district in Arkansas. The public school system was established by the Reconstruction era legislature; before the war, all education was private. Arkansas had struggled with a state banking crisis, resulting in the illegality of banking until 1868. After the reinstatement of banking, the Stark Bank became the first bank in the state in 1872, becoming the William McIlroy Bank four years later. The institution remains today as Arvest Bank.

===School integration===
In 1954, Charleston, Arkansas was the first school district in the southern United States to implement school integration in response to &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. A few days later Fayetteville, to the north of Charleston, was the second school district in the southern United States to integrate schools after the Supreme Court of the United States decision.

==Geography==
===Topography===

Fayetteville is in the Boston Mountains, a subset of the Ozarks which runs through Northwest Arkansas, southern Missouri, and Eastern Oklahoma. The rocks of the Boston Mountains were formed when sandstones and shales were deposited on top of the Springfield Plateau during the Pennsylvanian Period. In the Fayetteville area, following uplift during the Ouachita orogeny, the sediments were eroded to expose the Mississippian limestone formations of the Springfield Plateau, while south of Fayetteville the remaining deeply eroded Pennsylvanian sediments form the steep Boston Mountains.

Fayetteville is also the namesake of the Fayetteville Shale, a geological formation which has recently become an epicenter for natural gas extraction by hydraulic fracturing.

===Metropolitan area===
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (2.59%) is water. The city is centrally located in Washington County, Arkansas, along Interstate 49/US Route 71. It is the only fully controlled access route through the area, which replaced the winding US 71 (now US 71B) in the 1990s. An interstate connection with Fort Smith to the south and Kansas City, Missouri, to the north has contributed to Fayetteville&#x27;s growth. Fayetteville is bordered along the north by Springdale and Johnson. At times, this transition is seamlessly urban. Fayetteville is not bordered by towns to its south, instead opening up to scenic country along the Boston Mountains Scenic Loop. Past the rural communities of Greenland and West Fork is Devil&#x27;s Den State Park. To the west is Farmington along US Route 62 and to the east of Fayetteville is undeveloped land in rural Washington County.

The Fayetteville–Springdale–Rogers Metropolitan Area consists of three Arkansas counties: Benton, Madison, and Washington. The area had a population of 463,205 at the 2010 census which increased to 546,725 by the 2020 census (an increase of 24.2 percent). Although the Metropolitan Statistical Area does not consist of the usual principal-city-with-suburbs geography, Fayetteville&#x27;s adjacent communities include Elkins, Farmington, Greenland, Habberton, Johnson, and Wyman.

===Districts===
Fayetteville is entirely contained within Fayetteville Township, as the township and city have identical boundaries. Although Arkansas generally does not use its civil townships for any governmental purpose, they are used for voting boundaries in some places.

Generally the part of Fayetteville west of I-49/US 71 is called west Fayetteville. Another prominent district is Uptown Fayetteville, which encompasses the scores of business and new homes near the Northwest Arkansas Mall in north Fayetteville. The University of Arkansas defines its own part of Fayetteville, with dozens of student apartments and restaurants located near campus. The university&#x27;s impact is also apparent along College Avenue, which contains hundreds of shops and restaurants. Northeast of campus are the Wilson Park Historic District and the Mount Nord Historic District. The Fayetteville Historic Square is the original city center of Fayetteville, and Dickson Street is the best-known entertainment district in Arkansas. Homes atop Mount Sequoyah in the eastern part of the city encircle Mount Sequoyah Retreat and Conference Center. There are old structures along the former Butterfield Overland Mail route, a stagecoach route to San Francisco now known as Old Wire Road. Fifteenth Street forms the southernmost residential district of Fayetteville, with the Fayetteville Industrial Park to its east.

====Annexed communities====
Fayetteville has annexed six unincorporated communities within its current corporate limits. Four of them are still listed as &quot;populated places&quot; by the USGS Board on Geographic Names. The other two are listed as &quot;historical populated places.&quot; Annexations since 1870 are displayed on Fayetteville&#x27;s website in the interactive maps section. Fayetteville&#x27;s second annexations took place in 1946 when it incorporated Fayette Junction and McNair into the city. Baldwin was added the next year, with Barbara and Ruckers Grove being annexed in 1967. Fayetteville&#x27;s most recent annexation occurred in 1982 when White Rock was added to the city limits.

===Climate===
Fayetteville has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;). The city experiences all four seasons and receives cold air masses from the north; however, some of the Arctic masses are blocked by the higher elevations of the Ozarks. July is the hottest month of the year, with an average high of and an average low of . Temperatures above are rare but do occur, on average, 3 times a year. January is the coldest month with an average high of and an average low of . Highs below occur on average 10.4 times a year, with 0.6 nights per year dropping below . The city&#x27;s highest temperature was , recorded on July 14, 1954. The lowest temperature recorded was , on February 12, 1899.

Precipitation is weakly seasonal, with a bimodal pattern: wet seasons in the spring and fall, and relatively drier summers and winters, but some rain in all months. The spring wet season is more pronounced than fall, with the highest rainfall in May. That differs slightly from the climate in central Arkansas, where the fall wet season is more comparable to spring.

==Economy==

Walmart is based in nearby Bentonville, Arkansas, and is one of six Fortune 500 corporations based in the state (the others are Dillard&#x27;s, J.B. Hunt, Murphy Oil, Tyson Foods, and Windstream). Tyson Foods is based in Springdale, Arkansas, which is adjacent and to the north of Fayetteville. Although they are not based in Fayetteville, the corporations have a big impact through the University of Arkansas. The Sam M. Walton College of Business (named for Sam Walton) at the university has received numerous donations from the Walton family. Tyson also has a presence on campus at the Tyson Center for Excellence in Poultry Science, which holds classes for the Dale Bumpers College of Agricultural, Food and Life Sciences. The poultry science program at Arkansas is one of the Top 5 programs in the United States. 

Transportation company J. B. Hunt is based in Lowell, Arkansas, which is between Rogers and Springdale. It has donated millions of dollars to the university&#x27;s logistics program, including $10 million funding the J.B. Hunt Center for Academic Excellence that completed in 2010. The University of Arkansas has also been changing into a research-centered university since the late-20th century. The university&#x27;s stated goals now include becoming the economic engine for the region, the state of Arkansas, and beyond. This focus on innovation has helped draw students who were interested in research to Fayetteville. This shift in emphasis was recognized by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching with classification in the category of &quot;R1, Highest Research Activity,&quot; in 2011.

In 2011, DataRank, a company which provides businesses with tools for analyzing conversations about their brands and competitors, was founded in Fayetteville. In 2016, the City of Fayetteville announced its intention to become &quot;The Startup City of the South&quot; and work on further development of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. This endeavor is fostered through support from the University of Arkansas and non-profit initiatives such as the Walton Family Foundation and Community Venture Foundation.

==Arts and culture==
Fayetteville&#x27;s culture is a combination of a Southern city, college town, and the fast-growing Northwest Arkansas metro area.

Fayetteville shares many of the characteristics commonly given to Arkansas as a Southern state, yet it has also absorbed cultural influence from the Mid and South West. Located in the mid-South, Fayetteville&#x27;s culture is distinct and it differs from the southeastern portion of the state and other Southeastern Conference college towns, areas more commonly associated with the Deep South. Many of the city&#x27;s first settlers came from Mid South states like Kentucky and Tennessee, who found the Ozarks similar to the Appalachian Mountains back home. The uplands of Arkansas, including the Fayetteville area, did not participate in large-scale plantation farming with slaves like the Arkansas Delta, instead electing to settle in small clusters, relying largely on subsistence agriculture and hunting rather than the settlement patterns common in the Midwest and the Deep South. The hillbilly stereotype given to the Ozarks and Appalachians is largely a derivative of the difficult topography, poor quality or absent formal education, and mostly cashless self-sustaining economy found in those regions. Fayetteville&#x27;s large proportion of Southern Baptist and Methodist adherents reflect a trend often associated with the Deep South.

The city also derives a cultural identity from the University of Arkansas, exhibiting many trademarks of a college town such as a prominent arts and music scene, socially-progressive residents, an emphasis on supporting local businesses, and a community focus on environmental sustainability. Fayetteville shares a passion for collegiate athletics similar to many other Southeastern Conference member institution cities including Oxford, Mississippi and College Station, Texas. The university itself is a great magnet for fresh faces and young professionals from all across the nation and the world. Fall 2017 enrollment reports said that 55% of U of A students were from Arkansas, 42% from out of state, and the remaining 3% from foreign countries.

Fayetteville has a strong BBQ tradition, and the majority of the city&#x27;s barbecue joints serve Memphis-style barbecue, with some Texas barbecue influence. Fayetteville is also home to a diverse array of dining options as Thai, Vietnamese, and Cajun eateries which are in the city&#x27;s commercial districts. The Fayetteville Roots Festival, an annual celebration of local cuisine and music, only adds to the growing foodie culture of Northwest Arkansas with its community celebrations in the historic Fayetteville Square.

===University of Arkansas===

The University of Arkansas is Fayetteville&#x27;s biggest attraction, with influence in the social, economic and educational aspects of Fayetteville. As the state&#x27;s flagship university, U of A has become integrated with Fayetteville and vice versa. Currently ranked the #165th best university in the country, the University of Arkansas Campus Historic District listed on the National Register of Historic Places contains and 25 buildings within a park-like arboretum. In autumn, hundreds of parents travel to Fayetteville to help their children move into the various residence halls and apartments in the area, with thousands more attending Razorback football home games. Fans return for basketball games to pack Bud Walton Arena, which was the fifth-largest on-campus arena upon completion. In spring the Hogs baseball team can be seen in Baum Stadium, named one of the top college baseball facilities in the South by Rivals.com in 2010 due to the use of a large donation by the Walton family.Senior Walk is a sidewalk record of every graduate from the University of Arkansas. It spans nearly the entire sidewalk network in the core of the campus.

During the last decade, the university has drawn a large influx of students from bordering states, largely due to the New Arkansan Non-Resident Tuition Award scholarship program. As of Spring 2018, nearly 40% of the student population is made up of students hailing from outside of Arkansas. As a result, student-centered off-campus apartments communities are being rapidly built to accommodate the growing student population.
===Dickson Street===
Dickson Street is the primary entertainment district in the region, including musical and stage performances, shopping, bars, and restaurants. The West Dickson Street Commercial Historic District includes several blocks along its namesake street as well as a few blocks of West Avenue lined with unique shops, restaurants and bars. Adjacent to the University of Arkansas campus, several of Dickson Street&#x27;s establishments cater to students and locals alike. The district has been enjoying a rejuvenation that began in the 1980s by Dickson Street merchants who had watched the street turn into a dilapidated, crime-filled area. Many businesses had relocated onto College Avenue, leaving Dickson Street empty and in disrepair. The steady improvements by local entrepreneurs during this time lured the Walton Arts Center, today Arkansas&#x27;s premier center for arts and entertainment, to locate on Dickson Street, a decision that proved beneficial to all parties involved.

The Walton Arts Center is the result of a joint effort between the City of Fayetteville and the University of Arkansas to bring arts to the city. The center is located on Dickson Street halfway between the university and the town square. It currently features a full Broadway theater season, arts camps, continuing education opportunities for teachers of the arts, university-sponsored performances in addition to serving as a host for community events. A considerable donation from the namesake Walton family assisted greatly in the construction of the building.

TheatreSquared, Northwest Arkansas&#x27;s only year-round professional regional theatre, is located just off Dickson Street, with an annual audience of 40,000 patrons including 18,500 students reached through outreach programs. The theatre was recognized in 2011 by the American Theatre Wing as one of the nation&#x27;s ten most promising emerging theatres. Dickson Street is also home to George&#x27;s Majestic Lounge, the oldest live music venue in Arkansas and one of the oldest bar and concert venues in the Midwest. Opened by George Pappas in 1927, George&#x27;s was the first bar in the state to integrate in the late 1950s, and began hosting live concerts in the 1970s.

===Fayetteville Square===
The Fayetteville Historic Square has been the center of Fayetteville since the county&#x27;s first courthouse was located there in 1829. The area is surrounded by wide sidewalks, landscaped gardens, and one-way streets. The Square plays host to a variety of events, including First Thursday on the Square, the Block Street Block Party, the Lights of the Ozarks Festival, Last Night Fayetteville, and Fayetteville Farmer&#x27;s Market. Containing boutiques, restaurants, music venues, museums, condos, the visitor center, and a convention center, the square has both historic structures and new constructions.

The farmers&#x27; market began in 1974 and runs 7am to 1pm from the first Saturday in April through the last Saturday before Thanksgiving set in the Fayetteville Historic Square. Over 60 vendors provide locally grown fruits and vegetables in addition to crafts, flower bouquets, music and art, making the Fayetteville Farmers&#x27; Market very diverse. Upon receiving a grant in 2011, the Fayetteville Farmers&#x27; Market now accepts electronic benefit transfer (EBT) and food stamps. The market has been lauded by the Farmers Market Coalition for its formatting which allows farmers to interact directly with customers and also empowering each vendor with a vote before making major changes in market policy. The farmers&#x27; market moves to the Botanical Garden of the Ozarks for Sunday mornings with 20–30 vendors, with some vendors also choosing to attend the Mill District Farmer&#x27;s Market on Thursday evenings.

The Fayetteville Public Library, founded in 1916, was moved in October 2004 into a $23 million building, which was the first &quot;green&quot; building in Arkansas. The Blair Library was awarded the 2005 Thomson Gale Library Journal Honorable Mention Library of the Year award, and as a testament to its popularity has seen its popularity increase, with twice as many items checked out in 2005 than in 1997. The library has a local coffeeshop called Arsaga&#x27;s, and hosts several events including film festivals, book signings, and public forums throughout the year.

===Historic districts and properties===
Fayetteville contains 40 listings on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), the official federal list of districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects deemed worthy of preservation. The University of Arkansas Campus Historic District constitutes the historic core of the UA campus. Residential historic districts with historically and architecturally significant contributions to Fayetteville include the Mount Nord Historic District, Washington-Willow Historic District, and Wilson Park Historic District. The Square is anchored by five NRHP structures; the original Fayetteville post office built in 1911, the Old Bank of Fayetteville Building, the Lewis Brothers Building constructed in 1908, the Mrs. Young Building built in 1887, and the Guisinger Building. The former Washington County Courthouse and Old Washington County Jail are located one block east of the Square.

The Headquarters House served as a command post in the city for both the Union and Confederacy during the Civil War, and today serves as a museum. The Fayetteville National Cemetery is also listed on the NRHP. Built in 1867 following the Civil War, the cemetery has been expanded from its original 1,800 interments to over 7,000 interments.

Fayetteville was the first home of Bill and Hillary Clinton while they both taught law at the University of Arkansas School of Law. The house where they were married and in which they lived is now the Clinton House Museum highlighting Bill&#x27;s early political life and features campaign memorabilia, a replica of Hillary&#x27;s wedding dress, a photo gallery, and footage from Bill&#x27;s early campaign commercials.

Fayetteville is also home of Haas Hall Academy, a public charter school independent of all of the public school districts. Although Haas Hall Academy is in Fayetteville, the school serves students across Arkansas. Haas Hall was established in 2004 as the first open-enrollment public charter high school in Arkansas. The school has been recognized by &quot;Newsweek&quot; as the best school in Arkansas and 342nd best school in the nation. The nearest Catholic high school is Ozark Catholic Academy in Tontitown.

The University of Arkansas was founded in Fayetteville in 1871 as Arkansas Industrial University. The land-grant/space-grant, high-activity research institution is the flagship campus of the University of Arkansas System. Enrollment for the 2010 fall semester was 21,406 total students. Approximately 84% are Arkansas natives, with about 2% being international students due to the general lack of diversity in the region. Although it offers over 200 degree choices (excluding doctorate fields), the university is noted for its above average architecture, history, creative writing, poultry science, and business programs. Because of the University of Arkansas&#x27;s large presence in many aspects of the city&#x27;s economy, culture, and lifestyle, Fayetteville is often portrayed as a college town with elements of dominance by Walmart.

==Infrastructure==

===Transportation===
====Major highways====

* Interstate 49
* US Route 62
* US Route 71
* US Route 71 Business
* Highway 16
* Highway 16 Spur
* Highway 45
* Highway 112
* Highway 180
* Highway 265
The major through route in Fayetteville is Interstate 49/US 71. The fully controlled access, four-lane expressway is a discontinuous piece of a route ultimately planned to connect Kansas City, Missouri, to New Orleans. Formerly designated as Interstate 540 with the re-designation as Interstate 49 being granted by the U S Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration on March 28, 2014, the highway became the first freeway in the area when it was completed in the 1990s to relieve the former US 71 (now US 71B) of a much-increased demand of through travelers following the unanticipated and rapid growth of the Northwest Arkansas metro. area. Future plans for the I-49 corridor include completion of a freeway segment through Western Arkansas to Texarkana.

Other major north–south routes in Fayetteville include US 71B, which was the predecessor to I-49/US 71. This route is now mostly designated College Avenue in Fayetteville and features dozens of restaurants and stores. To the east of College Avenue is the oldest road in Fayetteville, Arkansas Highway 265. This route first was used by Native Americans as the Great Osage Trail, followed by Civil War troops bound for Fort Smith, Arkansas, the Trail of Tears, the Butterfield Overland Mail stagecoach route, and later still the telegraph. To the west of College Avenue is Gregg Avenue, which contains many student-oriented apartments along its shoulders and further west is Garland Avenue. This route runs along the campus of the University of Arkansas in south Fayetteville, with apartments and duplexes along its northern routing.

====Public transportation====
The city of Fayetteville has two major providers of public transportation. Razorback Transit is a free bus system centered on the campus of the University of Arkansas with routes to other Fayetteville destinations such as Dickson Street or the Northwest Arkansas Mall. Ozark Regional Transit runs throughout both Washington and Benton counties and is a broader bus-based regional transit system. Jefferson Lines provides intercity bus service connecting Fayetteville to much of the Midwest.

====Aviation====
Drake Field, formerly Fayetteville Municipal Airport, is owned by the city and serves general aviation. The nearest airport for commercial flights is Northwest Arkansas National Airport (XNA), 17 miles northwest of the city. The airport opened in 1998. Drake Field receives many sports charters year round because of the Arkansas Razorbacks using the airport.

===Utilities===

The City of Fayetteville owns and operates a large water system which provides services to several municipalities and unincorporated areas in the northern half of Washington County in addition to Fayetteville residents. Drinking water is pumped in from the Beaver Water District treatment plant in Lowell. The city uses of water per day on average.

====Wastewater====
Fayetteville owns its own wastewater operation, including a network of pipes and lift stations which convey wastewater to the city&#x27;s two wastewater treatment plants. Both plants are operated by CH2M and regulated by the Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ). Historically, all sewage was sent to the Paul R. Noland Wastewater Treatment Plant (Noland WWTP) on the east side of town. However, development on the city&#x27;s west side as well as the expense of pumping wastewater over East Mountain led the city to build the West Side WWTP in 2008. In addition to these two facilities, Fayetteville also operates 39 lift stations to pump wastewater over steep elevation rises in order to utilize gravity flow toward the WWTPs. Fayetteville also maintains a biosolids management program, in which biosolids, a byproduct of wastewater treatment, are land applied to provide nutrients to soil on which crops are grown.

Fayetteville&#x27;s first wastewater treatment arrived in 1913 in the form of an Imhoff tank on the West Fork of the White River. The facility was improved several times throughout the years until the construction of the City of Fayetteville Water Pollution Control Facility downstream of Lake Sequoyah. The plant was built in 1968 and has had major upgrades and was expanded. Now known as the Noland WWTP, it is designed for a flow rate of per day. The West Side WWTP has a design flow of per day with a peak flow capacity of per day during wet weather.

Fayetteville&#x27;s biosolids program was conceived after concerns about the costs and sustainability of landfill dumping arose. The city initiated a land application program on a farm site near the Noland plant which allowed the city to apply biosolids and then grow and harvest hay. In 2010, solar energy became the main component of the solids dewatering process after the installation of six solar dryers. From this program, the city gains additional revenue from the sale of hay and fertilizer (Class A biosolids).

<text>Lincoln is a city in Washington County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 2,294 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Northwest Arkansas metro area.

== History ==
=== Establishment ===
The area around Lincoln first saw white settlement in the late 1820s. It was first known as Blackjack after the blackjack oaks used to build the first schoolhouse. Joseph Carter built the first store in the area in 1874, still known as Blackjack. A nearby community on Beaty Mountain known as Mt. Hayes was settled in 1877. Starr Hill Township was also organized in the area during this period. The settlements drifted together and continued to grow until applying for a post office in 1884 within Carter&#x27;s store under the name Georgetown. The name was rejected; the postal service not wanting to duplicate Georgetown in White County, Arkansas (or Georgetown, Madison County, Arkansas). Carter submitted Lincoln as the new name. He said he chose the name seemingly at random, having &quot;seen it on a box&quot;, but others were skeptical that Carter had wanted to name the community for Abraham Lincoln all along, as he was a &quot;Republican from the North&quot;. Local acceptance for the name Lincoln was slow during the Reconstruction era following the bitter Civil War.

The settlement remained unincorporated until the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway (commonly called the Frisco) planned a branch line (the Ozark and Cherokee Central Railway [O&amp;CC]) between Fayetteville and Oklahoma. The right-of-way acquisition process brought a railroad agent through town, and he platted a town on south of the proposed railroad in 1903, but modified the plat in 1907. Following this plat, the city of Lincoln was incorporated on November 23, 1907.

<text>Prairie Grove is a city in Washington County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 7,045 at the 2020 Census. It is part of the Northwest Arkansas region, and home to Prairie Grove Battlefield State Park.

==History==
Prairie Grove was the site of the Battle of Prairie Grove during the American Civil War. Confederate forces under General Thomas C.

No clear cause has been identified but the NRDC notes the town is near a closed nuclear reactor and a low-level radioactive landfill. Arsenic from industrialized chicken manure is another possible source. In 2004, residents sued one of the poultry farms and the poultry feed manufacturer for spreading contaminated manure throughout Prairie Grove.

The 35 initial families settled on plots, planting gardens and vineyards. In 1909, the community incorporated, having grown to . Some residents resisted and resented the Italian influx, which largely spoke Italian and remained insulated. After threats and arson of barns and the school, Bandini confronted a group to stop the terrorization of the nascent Tontitown community.

<text>Winslow (formerly Summit Home) is a city in southern Washington County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 365 as of the 2020 census. It is part of the Northwest Arkansas region.

==History==
A stagecoach stop for many years, the community now known as Winslow first received a post office on December 11, 1876, known as Summit Home. The town grew significantly upon completion of the Winslow Tunnel, which allowed the St. Louis – San Francisco Railway (Frisco) to run through the steep Boston Mountains of south Washington County. The town was renamed to Winslow on August 3, 1881, in honor of Edward F. Winslow, president of the Frisco Railroad. The town became a somewhat resort town for its picturesque peaks at the end of the 19th century, drawing many wealthy from the Fort Smith area to summer there. It was incorporated on February 17, 1905.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land. Winslow is east of Devil&#x27;s Den State Park, along Arkansas Highway 74.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2010, there were 391 people, 146 households, and 105 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 180 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 95.9% White, 0.3% Black or African American, 0.5% Native American, 0.8% from other races, and 2.6% from two or more races. 2.0% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 146 households, out of which 24.7% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 56.2% were married couples living together, 12.3% had a female householder with no husband present, 3.4% had a male householder with no wife present, and 28.1% were non-families. 24.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 7.5% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.68 and the average family size was 3.15.

The distribution of age in Winslow reflects a change in the population that has occurred between 2000 and 2010 as the percentage of individuals under the age of 18 has dropped from 28.6% to 21.5% and individuals 24-44 dropped from 23.3% to 20.2%. All other age categories have in turn risen, those 18 to 24 have risen from 8.0% to 9.7%, those age 45 to 64 rose 25.8 to 33.5%, and those who were 65 years of age or older rose from 14.3% to 22.4%. This population shift is likely a result of the closure of the Winslow Public School district, as families with children left the area and new families have not replaced them. The median age was 43.6 years. For every 100 females, there were 109.1 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $32,692, and the median income for a family was $45,000. Males had a median income of $31,389 versus $41,719 for females. The per capita income for the city was $15,415. About 11.5% of families and 23.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 30.9% of those under age 18 and 13.7% of those age 65 or over.

==Education==

It is within the Greenland School District, and served by Greenland High School in Greenland.

For many years, Winslow had its own school system, the Winslow School District. It served the city and nearby rural areas in the southern portion of Washington County. By most counts, enrollment for grades K-12 was usually in the mid-20s per grade.

The district became part of the Greenland school district on July 1, 2004, after the Arkansas Legislature passed a state law that mandated districts with less than 350 students consolidate (Winslow had 273 students). The high school, which actually served grades 7-12, closed at the end of the 2004–2005 school year. The graduating class at the 2005 spring ceremony had 14 seniors. Winslow Elementary for grades K-6 was retained for a time following the high school closure. However, in November 2006, the Greenland School Board voted to close that school at the end of the 2006–2007 school year after two years with an enrollment of about 90 students. The mascot of Winslow Public Schools was the Fighting Squirrels.

The majority of the student body did not go to Greenland. They instead opted to transfer to the West Fork school district. The voters of Winslow are currently petitioning the Arkansas Department of Education and Arkansas Legislature to change Winslow&#x27;s former district from Greenland to West Fork.

The Winslow campus now houses the Winslow Public Library, Friends of the Library Bookstore, and Internet Cafe in the old High school building.

==Transportation==
As of 2023, there is no fixed route transit service in Winslow. Ozark Regional Transit operates demand-response service in the city. The nearest intercity bus service is provided by Jefferson Lines in Fayetteville.

== Education ==
The city&#x27;s education corridor is among the most prominent aspects in Beebe, with the city&#x27;s public schools grouped in an extensive campus situated across the street from Arkansas State University Beebe. Significant additions have been made to the campus since January 1999, when a powerful tornado destroyed nearly complete new school buildings and historic residential areas surrounding the downtown area. The public school district grew in 2004 when schools from nearby McRae were consolidated into the district, which today serves most of southwestern and south-central White County — proceeding westward to El Paso, eastward to Garner, and to other communities in between. Beebe&#x27;s district also includes the headquarters of a four-county educational service cooperative named for noted former U.S. Representative Wilbur Mills, and located on the city&#x27;s Main Street.

Public education is supported by the Beebe School District consisting of:

* Beebe High School (9-12)
* Beebe Junior High School (7-8)
* Beebe Middle School (5-6)
* Beebe Elementary School (1-4)
* Badger Elementary (2-4)
* Beebe Early Childhood School (KG-1)
* Badger Academy (7-12 alternative school)

Privately run day care and preschool services are also available in Beebe. In addition, Lighthouse Pentecostal Church in eastern Beebe provides religious-based K-12 and post-secondary education.

Founded as the Junior Agricultural School of Central Arkansas in 1927, Arkansas State University Beebe&#x27;s campus has evolved and grown to become a center for long-distance learning and technical trade programs in central Arkansas. The school has been affiliated with the Arkansas State University System since 1955. State Hall, the campus&#x27; administration building constructed in 1949, is among both the oldest buildings on the campus and in Beebe&#x27;s educational community. In the fall of 2005, ASU-Beebe had the second highest enrollment among Arkansas&#x27;s two-year colleges and universities, trailing only Pulaski Technical College in North Little Rock. ASU-Beebe today is the parent campus to branch campuses in Searcy (at the former Foothills Vocational-Technical Institute) and Heber Springs, and an educational center inside Little Rock Air Force Base in Jacksonville.

==Transportation==
Beebe is served by three main U.S. highways, US 64, US 67, and US 167. US 64 connects Beebe with the growing city of Conway, located west of Beebe. From Conway, US 64 meets I-40, which provides access to Fort Smith. U.S. 67/167 is a four-lane freeway that officially became I-57 on November 7, 2024 and connects Beebe with Little Rock to the southwest and with Searcy, Newport, and Walnut Ridge to the northeast. At Exit 28, US 64 joins US 67/167 as it goes northeast to Bald Knob where it branches off of US 67 and goes east to Wynne and eventually West Memphis in eastern Arkansas, while US 167 also splits from US 67 at Bald Knob to provide connection to Batesville.

Additionally, U.S. Route 67B starts from just east of US 67/US 167 at Exit 28 and goes east into downtown Beebe via W. Center Street, passing between the Beebe Public Schools main campus and ASU-Beebe. The path proceeds north from downtown near the historic Beebe Railroad Station back to US 64/US 67/US 167, as it is a concurrent highway with Arkansas Highway 31 (N. Main Street).

Beebe is also served by Arkansas Highway 367 (DeWitt Henry Drive), which is a former alignment of US 67 prior to the building of the US 67/US 167 freeway. A spur of Arkansas 367 is concurrent with a portion of the city&#x27;s N. Pecan Street, to join the freeway at Exit 29 and serve as ASU-Beebe&#x27;s primary freeway link. Just outside the city limits of Beebe, the rural areas are served by Highway 321 and Highway 267 to the northeast, and Highway 13 to the east.

Just like many towns in central and north central Arkansas, Beebe was formed near a railroad and the Union Pacific railroad tracks traverse through the south and east portions of town. The city of Searcy has the nearest airport, as the Searcy Regional Airport is located northeast of Beebe. Passenger service is available at Clinton National Airport, approximately southwest of Beebe on the east side of the city of Little Rock.

==Repeated blackbird death incidents==

Beebe made international news in early January 2011 following the death of more than 3,000 red-winged blackbirds and European starlings over the community. Arkansas state wildlife authorities first received reports on December 31, 2010, shortly before midnight. Further investigation revealed the birds fell over a one-mile (1.6 km) area of Beebe, with no other dead birds found outside that concentrated zone. The birds showed signs of physical trauma, leading one ornithologist with the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission to speculate the blackbirds might have been killed by lightning, high-altitude hail or possibly even fireworks. The birds were sent to laboratories in Georgia and Wisconsin for necropsies and to determine the cause of death. On January 5, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission confirmed that the incident was caused by a resident setting off professional-grade fireworks, startling the birds into a panic flight.

On New Year&#x27;s Eve 2011, a few hours before entering into 2012, blackbirds again were reported to be falling to the ground in Beebe. Several hundred had plunged to their deaths according to the local television station KATV which also reported that its radar had shown a &quot;large mass&quot; over the town.

<text>Georgetown is a town in southeastern White County, Arkansas, United States, overlooking the White River. First settled in 1789 before the Louisiana Purchase, the community is the oldest continuously settled area in Arkansas.

== History ==
The settlement of Arkansas Post, which began in 1686, came more than a century earlier, though that community dissolved in the years following the American Civil War. The state&#x27;s next oldest community after Georgetown — Batesville — was founded approximately 21 years later.

In 1945, the White River flooded its banks in Georgetown. The disaster contributed to the demise the next year of the Missouri and North Arkansas Railroad, which had provided passenger and freight service since 1906 from Joplin, Missouri, to Helena, Arkansas.
The population of Georgetown was 126 at the 2000 census.

==History==
Originally known as Prospect Bluff, the town was founded in 1840 by Erastus Gregory. In 1871, a Baptist school, Judson University, was established in the area. A few months later, the name Prospect Bluff was changed to Judsonia, after the Baptist missionary Adoniram Judson, to help promote the school, which drew many northerners to the area.

Though the school closed in 1883, the town streets still bear the names of several well-known 19th-century Baptists: Judson and Hasseltine (after Adoniram Judson and his wife, Ann Hasseltine Judson), Wayland (after Francis Wayland, president of Brown University in Rhode Island), Wade (after the missionary Jonathan Wade) and Boardman (after the missionary George Boardman, whose widow, Sarah Hall Boardman became Judson&#x27;s second wife).

On the evening of March 21, 1952, tornadoes swept Arkansas leaving 111 dead. Fifty of those fatalities were in Judsonia and the near vicinity. It was reported that the only building in the town not damaged was the Methodist church, which is in the city&#x27;s downtown area along Van Buren Street.

&quot;That&#x27;s Judsonia&quot; by William Ewing Orr (1957, White County Printing Company) is a history of the community. Judsonia has a yearly festival called Prospect Bluff Days in honor of the towns origins.

<text>Searcy ( ) is the largest city and county seat of White County, Arkansas, United States. According to 2019 Census Bureau estimates, the population of the city is 23,767. It is the principal city of the Searcy, AR Micropolitan Statistical Area which encompasses all of White County. The city takes its name from Richard Searcy, a judge for the Superior Court of the Arkansas Territory. A college town, Searcy is the home of Harding University and ASU-Searcy.

== History ==
Originally named White Sulphur Springs, the town&#x27;s name was changed in 1837, two years after White County was created. The state changed the county seat name to honor Richard Searcy (1794-1832), a prominent Arkansas Legislator.

The town contained a health spa from its inception until 1820, when the alum, chalybeate, and white sulphur springs for which the spa was known dried up.

Israel Moore, who had traveled west from Philadelphia, was in charge of laying out Searcy&#x27;s original streets, and &quot;he proceeded to name the major streets of Searcy for those of downtown Old Philadelphia near Independence Hall; Race, Arch, Market, Vine, Spring, and the tree-honoring streets of Cherry, Spruce, Locust and Pine.&quot; In 1957, Searcy named Moore Street after the 19th-century founder.

Spring Street also has a namesake in Old City Philadelphia, but along with downtown Searcy&#x27;s Spring Park, this refers to the early history of the Searcy area, when the community was known as White Sulphur Springs. As early as 1834, local springs with purported therapeutic properties initially drew visitors to the area, similar to the popular attraction to Hot Springs.

During the American Civil War, the Battle of Whitney&#x27;s Lane was fought near Searcy, although the exact site is disputed. Searcy Landing, on the Little Red River, is the final resting place for some Union Army soldiers.

Searcy was incorporated on August 6, 1851,
The Smyrna Methodist Church located just to the west of Searcy is the oldest known church building still standing in the state. It was built in 1856 according to research done by David Stahle of the University of Arkansas Tree Ring Laboratory.

Searcy is also home to the oldest operational courthouse in the state, the White County Courthouse. Originally the home of the first permanent resident, David Crise, the courthouse was completed in 1837. After being replaced two times, the last rendition was built in 1871. The most recent courthouse has a clocktower with a model of the Liberty Bell dating from 1855.

Searcy was a stop on the defunct Missouri and North Arkansas Railroad, which provided passenger and freight service from 1906 to 1946 from Joplin, Missouri, to Helena in Phillips County in eastern Arkansas.

On August 9, 1965, a fire killed 53 civilian workers in a Titan II missile silo north of Searcy. It was one of the largest industrial accidents in American history.

Despite having lost many factory jobs in the late 20th century, Searcy experienced a brief economic revitalization in the past decade from the leasing of mineral rights to natural gas companies. Almost all drilling in the Fayetteville Shale area has since ceased. Some residents express concern about the deleterious environmental effect of the extensive drilling projects that have taken place.

In 2019, the city of Searcy was the winner of the &quot;Small Business Revolution on Main Street&quot; award of $500,000 to revamp six small businesses and a season featuring these renovations on the Hulu show hosted by Amanda Brinkman.

The facility is still open as a Sam&#x27;s Club distribution center, while an additional larger facility has since opened in southern Searcy to service Walmart stores. The company has also operated a retail location in eastern Searcy (near the city&#x27;s original distribution center) since the 1970s, originating as an earlier &quot;Discount City&quot; format that grew into a more common &quot;supercenter&quot; format over the course of two relocations farther eastward; a Neighborhood Market grocery location was added in more recent years in western Searcy.

In recent years, ITT, Maytag, and Kohler closed large factories in the city. Many companies associated with natural gas that supported the brief natural gas boom have also left the city and the economy has suffered.

<text>Augusta is a city in Woodruff County, Arkansas, United States, located on the east bank of the White River. The population was 1,998 as of the 2020 Census. The city is the county seat of Woodruff County. 

==History==
The location was a natural riverboat landing spot on the navigable White River. After the chaos of the American Civil War and its immediate aftermath, the town entered its greatest period of prosperity in the 1870’s as a year-round riverboat transport point for a wide variety of goods, serving vessels from as far away as Memphis and New Orleans. Thus, when railroads began entering the county in the late 1800’s, the good people of Augusta opted out of the apparently-unnecessary innovation and allowed their town to be bypassed by the tracks. When river traffic began to decline, the citizens realized their mistake, and decided to build their own railroad to link to the national rail grid. What became the Augusta Railroad lasted from 1886 to 1958 or 1959.

==Geography==
Augusta is located approximately northeast of Little Rock and west of Memphis, Tennessee. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

===Region===

The Arkansas Delta is a subregion of the Mississippi Alluvial Plain, which is a flat area consisting of rich, fertile sediment deposits from the Mississippi River between Louisiana and Illinois. Prior to settlement, Woodruff County was densely forested, with bayous, sloughs, and swamps crossing the land. Seeking to take advantage of the area&#x27;s fertile soils, settlers cleared the land to better suit row crops.

===County===
Although some swampland has been preserved in the Cache River NWR and some former farmland has undergone reforestation, the majority (56 percent) of the county remains in cultivation.

The nearby Cache River NWR, owned by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, is a preservation area maintaining the original features of the area. Stretching approximately across adjacent counties, the NWR is listed as a Ramsar wetlands of international importance, and serves as a key wintering area for ducks and the largest contiguous tract of bottomland hardwood forest in North America.

<text>Cotton Plant is a city in southern Woodruff County, Arkansas, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city had a total population of 529.

==History==

In 1820, when settlers from neighboring states first came to the Cotton Plant area, it was covered in dense timber and cane. As a small town began to take shape at the site of present-day Cotton Plant, those settlers initially named their community Richmond.

William Lynch brought cotton seeds with him from Mississippi in 1846, and the new crop flourished. The community was forced to change its name to Cotton Plant since a community named Richmond was already registered in Little River County. On July 7, 1862, Confederate units and Cotton Plant locals skirmished with the 1st and 2nd Brigade, 1st Division, Army of the Southwest for the Union, a last-ditch effort by the Confederates to stop Samuel Curtis&#x27; march to Helena. The Confederates were soundly defeated, allowing Curtis and his army to eventually take Helena, resupply his army, and take Little Rock the following year.

A new line of the Batesville and Brinkley Railroad charged the Cotton Plant economy when it was completed in 1881. Warehouses, cotton gins, and a cotton compress brought jobs to the city, and downtown Cotton Plant became a bustling cultural center for Woodruff County. In 1908, the newly completed Missouri and North Arkansas Railroad opened up the timber industry about Cotton Plant, bringing the Standard Stave and Hoop Mill, sawmills, woodworking factories, and a veneer plant in subsequent years. Hit hard by the Great Depression, the Works Progress Administration was tasked with installing a water and sewer system in town in 1935. Residents celebrated with fireworks and parades upon the completion of the project. The community was also impacted by World War II, but boomed after the war, experiencing its most prosperous times in the 1950s.

<text>McCrory is a city in Woodruff County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 1,583 at the 2020 census.

The McCrory Commercial Historic District, the McCrory Waterworks, and the Dr. John William Morris Clinic are all listed on the National Register of Historic Places listings in Woodruff County, Arkansas.

==History==
The town began to get organized when word spread in 1886 that local land had been donated by one Wade McCrory to the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway for their projected route from Memphis, Tennessee to Little Rock. The first train actually arrived the next year, and the town was formally incorporated on January 30, 1890. 

Given that another railway called the Batesville and Brinkley Railroad had in the early 1880’s built two miles west of town, local McCrory businessmen in 1906 tried to leverage their railroad connections by creating a tramway running from McCrory directly to the Batesville &amp; Brinkley, at a point originally known as Martin’s Junction, later Jelks, and finally becoming Patterson in 1919. On May 21, 1910, the owners decided to form a fully-fledged railroad called the McCrory and Beedeville Southern Railway. The original plan was to run from McCrory north-northeast to the timber processing town of Beedeville, but this was quickly modified to include an extension west from McCrory to Jelks, replacing the tramway. The line to Jelks was completed around August of 1911, along with two miles (to Comers Spur) toward the Beedeville objective. Financial problems occurred almost immediately, but the line was extended about another 4 miles to around Odessa, Arkansas by November of 1912, and about another three-and-a-half miles to a point known as Langley Junction by November of 1913. This gave the railroad a final line of about eleven-and-a-half miles of track from Jelks to Langley Junction, which was still about three-and-a-half miles short of Beedeville. The railroad went bankrupt and was out of business by 1914, with the rails removed soon after.

<text>Patterson is a city in Woodruff County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 310 as of the 2020 Census.

The townsite was originally known as Martin’s Junction, because the junction of the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway with the Batesville and Brinkley Railroad occurred at this spot.

The town name changed again to Patterson in 1919. While the town still has a rail connection, the junction is gone because the successors of the Batesville and Brinkley removed that line around the start of World War II.

<text>Dardanelle is a city in northeast Yell County, Arkansas, United States. The population was 4,517 at the 2020 census. Along with Danville, it serves as a county seat for Yell County. It is located near Lake Dardanelle.

Dardanelle is part of the Russellville Micropolitan Statistical Area.

== History ==

Dardanelle is one of the oldest cities in the state of Arkansas. Officially incorporated in 1855, Dardanelle celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2005. However, the area had been settled for years before that, first being established as a river town in the mid-18th century. It is Yell County&#x27;s dual county seat, sharing that title with Danville.

The Treaty of Council Oaks was signed on June 24, 1823, on what is now North Front Street beneath two huge oak trees (102 feet high and 400–500 years old). Under orders of President James Monroe, U.S. Army Colonel David Brearley and secretary of Arkansas Territory Robert Crittendon met with Black Fox and several Cherokee leaders to determine boundaries. As a result of the treaty, the Cherokees gave up all of their land in Arkansas south of the Arkansas River. One of the trees was destroyed in the early 1990s in a flood, but the other is still standing. The site is now a city park.

Because of its location on the banks of the Arkansas River, Dardanelle was one of Arkansas&#x27;s leading towns in the 19th century. Hundreds of barges, steamboats, and other vessels traveled by the town annually. Approximately halfway between the state&#x27;s two largest cities of Little Rock and Fort Smith, Dardanelle was a transportation and business hub, known as a marketplace for gin, rum and cotton.

Dardanelle has a history of being one of the state&#x27;s leading immigration centers that continues to this day. Vast numbers of Czech and German families, including the Ballouns, Vodrazkas, Staneks, and Pfeiffers, came to the town in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and their impact can still be felt. As of 2010, Dardanelle has one of the highest percentages of Hispanics in the state, with over 36% of the town&#x27;s population Hispanic (up from 21% in 2000).

Merritt Park opened in the late 1990s on the west side of town. It is a large, state-of-the-art park featuring outstanding baseball facilities, a playground, soccer fields, basketball courts, and a walking/jogging trail. The adjacent Dardanelle Community Center opened around the same time, and provides multiple services for the community.

In the late 19th century, a pontoon bridge between Dardanelle and Russellville replaced ferry service. Spanning 2,208 feet, it was the longest pontoon bridge ever constructed across a moving body of water. The bridge was completely washed out multiple times during its nearly forty years of existence.

The Dardanelle Lock &amp; Dam, constructed in the 1960s as a part of the McClellan-Kerr Navigation System, led to the formation of Lake Dardanelle. It is a source of hydropower, and helps regulate river traffic on the Arkansas River. In 2013 it had an operating budget just over 8.9 million dollars.

During the 2019 Arkansas River floods, a levee just south of Dardanelle near Holla Bend failed and broke at 1 a.m. Friday, May 31. Over the next few days water came perilously close to homes, schools and businesses in the southern part of Dardanelle but receded before causing any major damage.

<doc id="107330" wikidata="Q1006582" url="?curid=107330" title="Ashland, California">
<text>Ashland is a census-designated place (CDP) and unincorporated community in Alameda County, California, United States. The population was 23,823 at the 2020 census. Ashland is located between the city of San Leandro to the north, the unincorporated community of Cherryland to the south, the unincorporated community of Castro Valley to the east, and the unincorporated community of San Lorenzo to the southwest.

Ashland shares a postal zip code with the neighboring unincorporated community of San Lorenzo to the southwest, as well as the close by cities of Hayward to the south and San Leandro to the north.
Ashland has been informally, albeit incorrectly, known as &quot;unincorporated San Leandro&quot; or &quot;unincorporated Hayward&quot; due to Ashland not having its own postal zip code designation.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , all of it land and sits at an elevation of 43 feet above sea level.
==History==
Construction of the Oakland-San Leandro-Hayward Electric Railway began in 1891. By 1892 14.3 miles of track ran along what was then known as County Road, today&#x27;s East 14th Street/Mission Boulevard between Hayward and Oakland. Electric train cars ran every half hour from 5 a.m. until midnight daily. Side feeder lines ran from Ashland Junction (near 150th St. and East 14th St.) along Telegraph, what today is known as Hesperian Boulevard and along Ashland Avenue to Lewelling Boulevard. Over time, the value of agricultural products which the area was famous for declined and the value of real estate rose, thus Ashland&#x27;s urban/suburban character developed when farmlands and orchards were subdivided into town lots of about one acre each. New communities and subdivisions sprang up along the rail line including Ashland and Haywards Park Homestead (between Foothill Boulevard and Mission Boulevard bordered by Mattox Road and Grove Way).

San Lorenzo Grove, an eight-acre natural park located on today&#x27;s Tracy Street, became a popular recreation destination for the region&#x27;s community. The park was owned by the Oakland-San Leandro-Hayward Electric Railway and included a dance pavilion, picnic grounds, playing fields, concession area and an outdoor bandstand. The park operated until 1917 when it was converted to apricot orchards then into single family residential subdivisions.

World War II brought a large number of new people to unincorporated Alameda County and after the war; large scale &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; housing subdivisions replaced most of the remaining agriculture, nurseries, and greenhouses. Ashland&#x27;s primary residential development took place during the post-war period; and after the closing of the Oakland-San Leandro-Hayward Electric Railway, Ashland remains mostly car dependent.

The Nimitz Freeway (Interstate 880) along with Interstate 238 opened in the late 1950s thus bisecting Ashland at Mission Boulevard continuing to Hesperian Boulevard. The creation of Interstate 238 has had the greatest effect on Ashland.

Ashland developed as a residential suburb in the 1940s.

Ashland is named after the Oregon ash tree which grew in abundance along the San Lorenzo creek and throughout the community.

The San Lorenzo Creek is the southern border of Ashland and boasts the oldest bay tree in the world.

<text>Castro Valley is a census-designated place (CDP) in Alameda County, California, United States. At the 2010 census, it was the fifth most populous unincorporated area in California. The population was 66,441 at the 2020 census.

Castro Valley is named after Guillermo Castro, a noted 19th-century Californio ranchero who owned the land where the community is located.

==History==

Before the arrival of European settlers the area was settled by the &quot;Chocheño&quot; (also spelled &quot;Chochenyo&quot; or &quot;Chocenyo&quot;) subdivision of the Ohlone Native Americans.

With the arrival of Europeans, they established Mission San Jose in 1797. The area Castro Valley now occupies was part of the extensive colony of New Spain in what was the province of Alta California.

Castro Valley was part of the original 28,000 acre (110 km) land grant given to Castro in 1840, called Rancho San Lorenzo. This land grant included Hayward, San Lorenzo, and Castro Valley, including Crow Canyon, Cull Canyon, and Palomares Canyons. Castro had a gambling habit and had to sell off portions of his land to pay gambling debts. The last of his holding was sold in a sheriff&#x27;s sale in 1864 to Faxon Atherton for $400,000.

Atherton (after whom the city of Atherton is named) in turn began selling off his portion in smaller parcels. Two men named Cull (the namesake of Cull Canyon) and Luce bought some 2,400 acres (10 km) and began running a steam-operated saw mill in Redwood Canyon. The Jensen brothers also bought land from Atherton in 1867.

In 1866, Redwood school was built, the first public school in the area. Many Portuguese families immigrated to the surrounding canyons (especially Palomares Canyon) and farmed large amounts of land, where their descendants remain today. In the 1870s, Lake Chabot, a reservoir and popular park, was built by Chinese laborers living at Camp Yema-Po. 
During the 1940s and 1950s, Castro Valley was known for its chicken ranches. Later it developed into a bedroom community, where workers live and commute to their jobs in the surrounding communities.

==Geography==
Lake Chabot lies in the northwest part of Castro Valley. Directly to the west is San Leandro. Hayward is to the south. Dublin, Pleasanton, and San Ramon are to the east.

The eastern hills of Castro Valley constitute the headwaters of the San Lorenzo Creek watershed and the origin of several creeks that flow into San Lorenzo Creek: Bolinas, Castro Valley, Chabot, Crow, Cull, Eden, Hollis, Kelly Canyon, Norris, and Palomares Creeks.

<text>Dublin is a suburban city of the East Bay in California, United States. It is located within the Amador Valley of Alameda County&#x27;s Tri-Valley region. It is located along the north side of Interstate 580 at the intersection with Interstate 680, roughly east of downtown San Francisco, east of downtown Oakland, and north of downtown San Jose.

It was referred to as &quot;Dublin&quot; in reference to the city of Dublin, Ireland, because of the large number of Irish who lived there. The post office formally adopted the name in the 1890s.

The population was 72,589 as of the 2020 census, which had grown from 46,063 in 2010. In 2013, Dublin was the second fastest-growing city in the state of California, behind only Santa Clarita. In 2019, census data showed Dublin as one of the fastest-growing cities in the country.

==History==

In 1835, José María Amador was granted 16,500 acres for his service as a Mexican soldier and in Mission San Jose where he was an administrator in the valley which was named Amador Valley after him. In 1850, Irish settlers bought land from Amador and founded a town.

Several historical sites are preserved and located where Dublin Boulevard is crossed by Donlon Way, itself formerly the northernmost segment of the main road to Sunol and Niles Canyon (present-day Foothill Road):
* The Murray Schoolhouse (established in 1856 with 50 pupils)
* Green&#x27;s Store (opened in 1860) current home of the Dublin Church of Christ.
* The old cemetery was formally established in 1859, although people had been buried in the churchyard for years before 1859.
* Old St. Raymond Church (built in 1859) is listed on the National Register of Historic Places

Dublin Boulevard, a generally east–west road running just north of Interstate 580, was a part of the Lincoln Highway and later U.S. Route 50. The street formerly curved southward near today&#x27;s Hansen Drive to follow present-day Dublin Canyon Road toward Hayward.

In 1960, the first housing tracts were built in West Dublin, transforming the formerly rural community into a suburb. It grew steadily from the early 1960s onward as both a residential and retail center. The City became incorporated in February 1982.

Although a post office operated from 1860 to 1908 in Dougherty, which broke off from Dublin, Dublin&#x27;s first post office was opened in 1963, and is still in operation today.

===&quot;MythBusters&quot; cannonball incident===

On December 6, 2011, during shooting for an episode of &quot;MythBusters&quot; at Camp Parks, a cannonball went skyward and zoomed through a nearby residence, coming to rest in a car. Many residents were shaken and the community was shocked, but nobody was injured. &quot;MythBusters&quot; cast members Adam Savage and Kari Byron hosted a student engineering event at Dublin High School, a move to express gratitude to the community of Dublin for the access to Camp Parks as a shooting location. The Dublin Film Commission declared December 6 &quot;Victory in the battle for Dublin&quot;, poking at the rogue cannonball incident, and announced plans to host a film festival every December 6 to honor Dublin&#x27;s fallen cannonball. On December 6, 2012, Tri-Valley Film Coalition President Morgan Finley King hosted a film festival at the Dublin Library, in which winners of each category were awarded a &quot;Golden Cannonball Award&quot;.

===Measure M===

In 2000, following a conflict with Mayor Guy Houston and developers of the West Dublin Hills, Morgan King and David Bewley began a ballot initiative known as Measure M. The objective of the measure was to prevent the Dublin Hills from becoming overwhelmed with housing that had been promised to voters and that the housing would not be built on preserved open space. Measure M won in every precinct in Dublin and on the absentee ballots.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of of which 0.03% is water.

===Neighborhoods===
Wallis Ranch is a subdivision developed by Trumark Communities with approximately 816 units which opened its first phase in September 2016. Trumark divided the project into eight neighborhoods, selling seven of them to other homebuilders including Warmington Residential, PulteGroup, Taylor Morrison, KB Home and D.R. Horton. Architects KTGY Architecture + Planning, Dahlin Group and Gates &amp; Associates were the master plan architects. Teichert Construction built the infrastructure.

Tassajara Hills is another subdivision built by Toll Brothers, approximately 370 detached homes. Transit-oriented development around the city&#x27;s two BART stations continues with the Aster and Valor Crossing developments. Valor Crossing is an affordable housing project specifically designed for veterans and their families. Avalon Dublin Station is another recently completed luxury rental development by AvalonBay Communities.

<doc id="107334" wikidata="Q499178" url="?curid=107334" title="Emeryville, California">
<text>Emeryville is a city located in northwest Alameda County, California, in the United States. It lies in a corridor between the cities of Berkeley and Oakland, with a border on the shore of San Francisco Bay. The resident population was 12,905 as of 2020. Its proximity to San Francisco, the Bay Bridge, the University of California, Berkeley, and Silicon Valley has been a catalyst for recent economic growth.

It is the home to Pixar Animation Studios, Peet&#x27;s Coffee, the Center for Investigative Reporting, Alternative Tentacles and Clif Bar. In addition, several well-known tech and software companies are located in Emeryville: LeapFrog, Sendmail, MobiTV, Novartis (formerly Chiron before April 2006), and BigFix (now HCL). Emeryville attracts many weekday commuters due to its position as a regional employment center.

Emeryville has some features of an edge city; however, it is located within the inner urban core of Oakland/the greater East Bay. It was industrialized before the First World War.

== History ==
===Early history===
Before the colonization of the area by Spain in 1776, this area was long the site of indigenous settlements. The historic Ohlone Native Americans encountered the Spaniards and later European colonists. They thrived on the rich resources of the bayside location: gathered clams from the mudflats, oysters from the rocky areas, caught fish, and hunted a variety of game. In addition, women gathered acorns from the local oak trees, roots, and fruit. The Ohlone discarded clam and oyster shells in a single place, over time creating a huge mound, now known as the Emeryville Shellmound.

During the Spanish and Mexican eras, colonists constructed a small wharf near the mouth of Temescal Creek adjacent to the shellmound. The wharf served the Peralta family&#x27;s Rancho San Antonio. It was used for loading cattle hides, the principal product of the ranch, onto lighters, and transferring them to ocean-going ships, including New England–bound schooners.

Cattle were a major part of the economy into the American era, when numerous meat packing plants were established along the bayshore in Emeryville between 67th and 63rd streets, in an area called &quot;Butchertown&quot;. The cattle processed here were raised in nearby ranches and farms, and brought in by rail or barge. The odors from the corrals and slaughterhouses were notorious and often mentioned in local newspapers of the 19th and early 20th century.

Emeryville&#x27;s first post office opened in 1884.

The Town of Emeryville was incorporated December 2, 1896. It was named after Joseph Stickney Emery, who came during the California Gold Rush and acquired large tracts of land in what became known as &quot;Emery&#x27;s&quot;. In 1884, Emery was president of a narrow-gauge railroad called the California and Nevada Railroad. The railroad was originally intended to extend from Oakland, through Emery&#x27;s (at the time, an unincorporated settlement along the bayshore) and east across the Sierra Nevada to the gold mining town of Bodie, California. From Bodie the railroad would extend east through Nevada to a connection with the Denver &amp; Rio Grande Railroad. Despite these goals, the railroad was completed only from Oakland to Orinda. Its right-of-way was sold to the Santa Fe Railway. The Santa Fe constructed a rail yard and passenger depot below San Pablo between 41st Street and Yerba Buena Avenue. Although located in Emeryville, when the depot opened in 1902, it was called &quot;Oakland&quot; after the larger community.

===20th century and beyond===

The Key System, a local transit company, acquired the general offices of the California and Nevada and its nascent pier into San Francisco Bay. Key developed the pier to reach nearly to Yerba Buena Island. The Key System established its main rail yard adjacent to the yard of the Santa Fe in a large tract west of San Pablo Avenue. It was in the vicinity of Yerba Buena Avenue (so named because the island was visible in line with the thoroughfare). The Key System&#x27;s main power plant, used to drive its electric streetcars and commuter trains, was constructed adjacent to the city limits with Oakland. The immense smokestack was a local landmark for decades, surviving until being damaged in the Loma Prieta earthquake of 1989. It was demolished for safety reasons shortly thereafter.

The old Key System mainline to the pier, and later, to the Bay Bridge, ran in a subway below Beach Street and the Southern Pacific mainline near the power plant. That subway survives. Today it is used as a private entrance to the main sewage treatment plant of East Bay Municipal Utility District (EBMUD, the water utility serving Oakland and many surrounding cities). 

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, after the Santa Fe spun off its real estate development arm, this company acquired the rail yards and shops of the Key System and Santa Fe. This real estate was redeveloped by what was called the Catellus Development Corporation, as a shopping center and multi-unit residential district.

In the late 19th century, the city developed a large park around the shellmound. This included two dance pavilions, one of which was built on top of the shellmound. The Oakland Trotting Park, for Standardbred horse racing, was built nearby at the junction of the Berkeley Branch line with the mainline of the Southern Pacific. The old Emeryville Arena was torn down in February 1920, to make way for a new idea for a new venue to revive the sport of dog racing, but using what the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; described as an &quot;automatic rabbit&quot;.

On May 29, 1920, the first greyhound racing track to employ a mechanical lure in place of a live rabbit opened in Emeryville.

In the early 20th century, Emeryville was as well known for its gambling houses and bordellos as it was for its booming industrial sector. Earl Warren, then Alameda County district attorney, later California governor and Chief Justice of the United States, described it as &quot;the rottenest city on the Pacific Coast&quot;. During Prohibition and the Great Depression, Emeryville was a site of numerous speakeasies, racetracks and brothels; it became known as a somewhat lawless red light center. Today&#x27;s popular local restaurant, The Townhouse, was operated as a speakeasy during Prohibition. The Oaks Room Card Club operates today as a legal gambling establishment on San Pablo Avenue.

Emeryville was the site of Oaks Park, the home turf of the Pacific Coast League&#x27;s Oakland Oaks. The ballpark was located on the block bounded by San Pablo, 45th Street and Park Street (the fourth side was Watts Street). The site is now partly empty and fenced off. It is overlapped by Pixar Studios. Pixar&#x27;s main gate (on Park Street) lies directly on the old segment of Watts Street. The stadium did not front directly on San Pablo, where a strip of various small commercial buildings stood. They were replaced by the current, one-story commercial building housing several chain businesses.

During World War II, Emeryville was the southern terminus of the Shipyard Railway, a specially constructed electric rail line operated by the Key System to transport defense workers to the Kaiser Shipyards in Richmond. The station was on the west side of San Pablo Avenue on the Key&#x27;s yard property. The tracks led to San Pablo Avenue, where they were merged into existing streetcar tracks.

From the late 19th into the early 20th century, Emeryville continued development as an industrial city. Joining the meat-packing plants were the Judson Iron Works and the Sherwin-Williams paint company. From 1939 until the 1970s, the Sherwin-Williams plant roof featured a massive animated neon sign showing a can of red paint tilting, spilling, and covering a globe of the earth — with the slogan &quot;Cover the Earth&quot;. It was a familiar sight to eastbound motorists on the Bay Bridge. The sign was dismantled in the summer of 1977.

For decades the city was also the location of Shell Development, the research arm of Shell Oil Company; it relocated in 1972 to Houston, Texas. A large scrap metal yard (part of the Judson Steel mill) and its distinctive neon &quot;Judson Steel&quot; sign were visible for decades from the Eastshore Freeway until the mid-1980s. A large facility of the Pacific Intermountain Express (PIE) trucking firm was also visible. A heavy truck manufacturing division of what was formerly International Harvester, later Navistar, was located in Emeryville. One of its more popular over-the-road semi-truck models, the International DCO-405, became commonly and affectionately known as an &quot;Emeryville&quot;.

By the late 1960s, industries were beginning to move away from Emeryville. With the loss of jobs, the city began to decline. This began to change in the mid-1970s starting with the development of the marina section of Emeryville. The Judson steel mill abruptly shut down in the fall of 1986, after more than 100 years of operation, in the wake of declining profits and contentious labor negotiations.

==== Post-industrial redevelopment ====
By the late 1980s, a large shopping area had begun to develop north and south of the Powell Street corridor. Additionally, the Chiron Corporation (now Novartis), a major biotechnology company, established its headquarters just south of the old junction of the SP mainline tracks and the old Berkeley branchline (Shellmound Junction) at the end of Stanford Avenue, the site of the old Shellmound trotting course.

Following the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989, a new Amtrak depot was built in Emeryville to replace the former 16th Street Station in West Oakland. It had been deteriorating even before it was seriously damaged by the quake. The Emeryville station serves Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;California Zephyr&quot;, &quot;Coast Starlight&quot;, &quot;San Joaquin&quot;, and &quot;Capitol Corridor&quot; trains. The &quot;California Zephyr&quot; originates here with service daily to Chicago, Illinois via Salt Lake City, Utah and Denver, Colorado. Buses link the station with San Francisco.

In the late 1980s the Emeryville Public Market opened; this farmers&#x27; market also features up to twenty restaurants.

By the 1990s, the former tracts of the Santa Fe and Key System yards were redeveloped as a large shopping and residential area, as was the Shellmound corridor. Development of these areas included major roadwork, with the extension of 40th Street. The work included construction of a large overpass across the Southern Pacific (now Union Pacific) railroad tracks; it connected 40th Street to an extension of Shellmound Street, creating a single thoroughfare linking two sections of the new Emeryville. On the northern stretch of Shellmound Street, the Emery Marketplace and a movie multiplex were built. In 2007, the western end of Yerba Buena Avenue was linked with the northern end of the Mandela Parkway, creating a new through route between Emeryville and West Oakland.

In 2001, the city contracted developer Madison Marquette to build a new shopping center, the Bay Street Shopping Center. It was to be built on the site of a defunct paint factory. But this was a historic site of an Ohlone village and burial ground. Madison Marquette developers worked with archaeologists and Ohlone tribe representatives in order to avoid disturbing the human remains. The tribe approved reinterment of some remains at an undisclosed location on the site. The completed mall displays photographs of the historic shellmound, but it does not mention the burial grounds. An Ohlone representative said they believed the information would make shoppers there uncomfortable.

In February 2025, Sutter Health announced plans for a major healthcare expansion in Emeryville with a US$1 billion medical campus. This project will repurpose two existing buildings—located at 5555 Hollis Street and 5300 Chiron Street—as outpatient centers and specialty clinics set to open in 2028, and will include a new flagship hospital at 53rd and Horton Streets scheduled to open in 2033. The new hospital (expected to replace the Alta Bates campus in Berkeley) will feature at least 200 beds, emergency services, an intensive care unit, and private patient rooms. Designed to address the growing healthcare needs of the East Bay, the development is expected to boost Sutter Health’s patient capacity from roughly 480,000 to 800,000, and it is anticipated to have a significant positive economic impact on Emeryville by creating hundreds of jobs and stimulating local business growth.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which of it is land and of it (38.02%) is water. Named Watergate, the Emeryville marina is home to a mixed-use development, including two marinas (one public, the other private), a park, a residential condominium community known as Watergate, a business park with several office buildings, and several restaurants.

===Mudflats and other environmental features===

At one time, the Emeryville Mudflats were famous for their stench. In the 19th and early 20th century, this was caused by the effluent from the &quot;Butchertown&quot; area, where several meat-packing plants operated along the bayshore. They also dumped stripped carcasses in the bay here. Later, untreated sewage from Emeryville, Oakland, and Berkeley flowed directly into the bay over the mudflats, producing hydrogen sulfide gas, particularly noticeable on warm days. In the 1950s the East Bay Municipal Utility District constructed a regional sewage treatment plant near the eastern terminus of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, which, for the most part, cured the noxious problem.

The Emeryville Mudflats became notable in the 1960s and 1970s for public art, erected (with neither permission nor compensation) from driftwood timbers and boards by professional and amateur artists and art students from local high schools, UC Berkeley, the California College of Arts and Crafts and the Free University of Berkeley. The mudflats were even featured in the 1971 film &quot;Harold and Maude&quot;. These unsanctioned works were admired by some drivers heading westbound on the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge from Interstate 80.

In the late 1990s, the sculptures and materials were removed in the interest of establishing a more natural and undisturbed marshland for the nurturing of wildlife. This process continues around the bay in many other wetlands, former diked grazing fields, and salt production evaporation ponds.

Historically, Emeryville had been the location of a number of heavy industrial uses such as Judson Steel, whose properties were developed by bringing in waste and construction debris fill from San Francisco in the early 1900s. Correspondingly much of the underlying soil contained heavy metals, hydrocarbons and other soil contaminants. Much of this contamination was removed in the 1980s when the considerable wave of redevelopment occurred. The population had increased to almost 7,000 by the year 2000. Since then, the population has continued to grow and is estimated by General Plan projects a population of 16,600 by 2030. In addition, the city is home to about 20,000 current jobs; this number is projected to increase to about 30,000 by 2030.

===Climate===
Emeryville has a Mediterranean climate, similar to nearby Oakland.

===Retail centers===
As part of an urban renewal project, several shopping centers opened in the late 1990s next to the intersection of Interstate highways 80 and 580, capitalizing on Emeryville&#x27;s access to San Francisco as well as to East Bay customers. A new retail and residential development named Bay Street Emeryville now sits along Highway 80 and is home to many stores and restaurants.

===Top employers===

According to the city&#x27;s 2022 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:

==Transportation==
The Emeryville Amtrak station was completed in 1994 and serves four intercity rail lines:
* &quot;California Zephyr&quot;, as the western terminus of interstate service to Chicago
* &quot;Capitol Corridor&quot;, which is an intrastate commuter rail train between San Jose and Auburn via Sacramento
* &quot;Coast Starlight&quot;, which offers interstate service between Seattle and Los Angeles
* &quot;San Joaquins&quot;, an intrastate train between Sacramento and Bakersfield; Emeryville is on the branch to Oakland via Stockton
Emeryville is the primary San Francisco Bay Area station/stop for the two interstate lines, serving approximately 500,000 passengers annually; it replaced a station in West Oakland that was damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and was designed by Heller Manus Architects. Amtrak does not provide direct rail service to any city on the San Francisco Peninsula, including San Francisco. San Francisco passengers use a bus connector to Emeryville station, routed over the Bay Bridge, with a stop near the Salesforce Transit Center.

Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) is a commuter/metro heavy rail system which connects San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose in the greater Bay Area. The closest BART station is MacArthur station in Oakland, approximately east of the Amtrak station. Although Richmond station, approximately north of Emeryville, and Oakland Coliseum station, approximately south, both provide direct connections between Amtrak and BART, these stops are served only by &quot;Capitol Corridor&quot; commuter rail trains.

Public transit bus service for Emeryville is provided by AC Transit, which covers the East Bay counties of Alameda and Contra Costa. To supplement the local bus service, the city operates a free shuttle service called Emery Go Round with 15 minute headways on weekdays; it serves MacArthur BART, the Amtrak station, the Bay Street shops, the Watergate condominium complex and nearby marina, and other locations throughout the city and into Berkeley.

Freeway access to Emeryville is provided by a key section of Interstate 80, just north of where that freeway meets Interstate 880 and Interstate 580 in a major interchange known as the MacArthur Maze.

Emeryville also maintains a small marina with limited services. There is a standing citizen Bicycle Pedestrian Advisory Committee.

==In popular culture==
*Pixar produced the movie &quot;The Incredibles&quot;, which shows a part of Emeryville near their headquarters, in a map on the dashboard of the hero&#x27;s car. Their film &quot;Cars&quot; (2006) briefly shows a &quot;Welcome to Emeryville&quot; sign. Pixar&#x27;s Luca shows Emeryville&#x27;s zip code for a few seconds being used as a number for a train. 
*Emeryville is often referenced in the NBC dramedy series &quot;Parenthood&quot;, as the home of Sarah Braverman, the second oldest of the four siblings.
*The city of Emeryville is a mecha training grounds in the &quot;Mecha Samurai Empire&quot; series by Peter Tieryas and is featured prominently as the site of the yearly mecha combat between the Berkeley Military cadets.

==Notable people==
Emeryville residents include NBA player Draymond Green, first Filipino American city council member and mayor Dianne Martinez, and architect Kofi S. Bonner.

<text>Hayward is a city located in Alameda County, California, United States, in the East Bay subregion of the San Francisco Bay Area. With a population of 162,954 as of 2020, Hayward is the sixth largest city in the Bay Area, and the third largest in Alameda County. Hayward was ranked as the 36th most populous municipality in California. It is included in the San Francisco–Oakland–San Jose Metropolitan Statistical Area by the US Census. It is located primarily between Castro Valley, San Leandro and Union City, and lies at the eastern terminus of the San Mateo–Hayward Bridge. The city was devastated early in its history by the 1868 Hayward earthquake. From the early 20th century until the beginning of the 1980s, Hayward&#x27;s economy was dominated by its now defunct food canning and salt production industries.

==Name==
Hayward was originally known as &quot;Hayward&#x27;s&quot;, then as &quot;Haywood&quot;, later as &quot;Haywards&quot;, and eventually as &quot;Hayward&quot;. There is some disagreement as to how it was named. Most historians believe it was named for William Dutton Hayward (1815–1891), who opened a hotel there in 1852. William Hayward eventually became the road commissioner for Alameda County. He used his authority to influence the construction of roads in his own favor. He was also an Alameda County supervisor. The United States Geological Survey&#x27;s Geographic Names Information System states the city was named after Alvinza Hayward, a millionaire from the California Gold Rush. Regardless of which Hayward the area was named for, the name was changed to &quot;Haywood&quot; when the post office was first established in 1860.

In 1876, a town was chartered by the State of California under the name of &quot;Haywards&quot;. The name of the post office was then able to change because of the loss of the apostrophe before the &quot;s&quot;. This change occurred in 1880. In 1911, the town was officially renamed Hayward, dropping the &quot;s&quot;. However, the United States Board on Geographic Names would not recognize this name change until 1931.

==History==
===Early history===
Human habitation of the greater East Bay, including Hayward, dates from at least 4000 BC. The most recent pre-European inhabitants of the Hayward area were the Native American Ohlone people.

===19th century===

In the 19th century, the land that is now Hayward became part of Rancho San Lorenzo, a Spanish land grant to Guillermo Castro, in 1841. The site of his home was on the former El Camino Viejo, or Castro Street (now Mission Boulevard) between C and D Streets, but the structure was severely damaged in the 1868 Hayward earthquake, with the Hayward Fault running directly under its location. Most of the city&#x27;s structures were destroyed in the earthquake, the last major earthquake on the fault. In 1930, that site was chosen for the construction of the City Hall, which served the city until 1969. A post office opened in 1860, followed by the town&#x27;s incorporation in 1876.
Hayward grew steadily throughout the late 19th century, with an economy based on agriculture and tourism. Important crops were tomatoes, potatoes, peaches, cherries, and apricots. Hunt Brothers Cannery opened in 1895. Chicken and pigeon raising also played important roles in the economy. A rail line between Oakland and San Jose, the South Pacific Coast Railroad, was established but later destroyed in the 1868 earthquake. The Hayward shore of the Bay was developed into extensive salt evaporation ponds, and was one of the most productive areas in the world, with Leslie Salt being one of the largest companies.

===20th century===
The San Mateo–Hayward Bridge opened in 1929, connecting the city to the San Francisco Peninsula.

During the 1930s, the Harry Rowell Rodeo Ranch, now within the bounds of Castro Valley, drew rodeo cowboys from across the continent, and Western movie actors such as Slim Pickens and others from Hollywood.

Prior to World War II, Hayward had a high concentration of Japanese Americans, who were subject to the Japanese-American internment during the war. The war brought an economic and population boom to the area, as factories opened to manufacture war material. Many of the workers stayed after the end of the war. Two suburban tract housing pioneers, Oliver Rousseau and David D. Bohannon, were prominent builders of postwar housing in the area.

The Hayward Area Recreation and Park District was formed in 1944.

California State University, Hayward opened in the Hayward Hills in 1957. Southland Mall was dedicated in 1964.

The second San Mateo–Hayward Bridge opened in 1967. The City Center Building opened in 1969 and acted as the new city hall until 1989 when the Loma Prieta earthquake damaged the building and forced the city government to move out. The building was closed to the public in 1998, with the new Hayward City Hall opening the same year. Bay Area Rapid Transit began operating in the Bay Area in 1972, with stations in downtown Hayward and south Hayward.

The Hunt Brothers Cannery closed in 1981.

===21st century===

The city&#x27;s downtown area was slated for redevelopment in 2012 and 2013, with landscaping, new businesses opening up, and older ones getting façade upgrades.

Warren Hall on the California State University, East Bay campus was demolished in 2013.

The Russell City Energy Center began operating in 2013 at the Hayward shoreline.

In May 2015, the city&#x27;s former shoreline landfill was declared a site for conversion to a solar farm, set to generate enough electricity to power 1,200 homes. It will be one of 186 sites in the Regional Renewable Energy Procurement Project.

In October 2015, construction began for the Hayward 21st Century Library and Heritage Plaza. The library opened in September 2019, and the plaza was originally expected to open sometime in 2019.

==Former communities==
Mount Eden was a former city that was incorporated into Hayward in the 1950s, at the same time as Schafer Park.

Russell City was a former unincorporated community. It existed from 1853 until 1964. It is now the location of an industrial park. The Russell City Energy Center, a 429-megawatt natural gas-fired power plant built by Calpine, is located there.

Stokes Landing, Hayward Heath, and Eden Landing were communities now within Hayward city limits.

==Geography==

Hayward borders on many municipalities and communities. The cities bordering on Hayward are San Leandro, Union City, Fremont, and Pleasanton. The census-designated places bordering on Hayward are Castro Valley, San Lorenzo, Cherryland, Sunol, and Fairview. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . of it is land and of it (comprising 28.9%) is water. The San Lorenzo Creek runs through the city.

The Hayward Fault Zone runs through much of Hayward, including the downtown area. The United States Geological Survey has stated that there is an &quot;increasing likelihood&quot; of a major earthquake on this fault zone, with potentially serious resulting damage. Hayward&#x27;s historic city hall lies atop the fault line and was closed due to damage from gradual seismic activity. A street curb in Hayward that ran perpendicular to the fault was used for over 40 years by local geologists to record the movement of the plates; it had drifted out of alignment by the time it was inadvertently removed by the city government in 2016.

===Climate===
Hayward has a Mediterranean climate, and contains microclimates, both of which are features of the greater Bay Area. In 2012, the USDA rated Hayward as a zone 10A climate.

===Former businesses===
====Hunt Brothers Cannery====
The economy of Hayward in the first half of the twentieth century was based largely on the Hunt Brothers Cannery. The cannery was opened in Hayward in 1895 by brothers William and Joseph Hunt, who were fruit packers originally from Sebastopol, California. The Hunts initially packed local fruit, including cherries, peaches, and apricots, then added tomatoes, which became the mainstay of their business. At its height in the 1960s and 1970s, Hunt&#x27;s operated three canneries in Hayward, at A, B, and C Streets; an adjacent can-making company; a pickling factory; and a glass manufacturing plant. From the 1890s until its closure in 1981, Hunt&#x27;s employed a large percentage of the local population. The air around Hayward was permeated by the smell of tomatoes for three months of each year, during the canning season. The canneries closed in 1981, as there were no longer enough produce fields or fruit orchards near the cannery to make it economically viable. Much of the production was moved to the Sacramento Valley. The location of the former canneries is marked by a historic water tower with the Hayward logo. A housing development now occupies much of the former cannery site.

Hayward is served by Interstate 880 (also known as the Nimitz Freeway), Interstate 580 with a major intersection near downtown connecting State Route 238 and Interstate 238, State Route 92 (Jackson Street) and State Route 238 (Mission Boulevard/Foothill Boulevard). State Route 92 continues west as the San Mateo–Hayward Bridge. The intersection of 880 and 92 was reconstructed over a four-year period, with completion of the project in October 2011. Mission Boulevard has been long known for chronic traffic congestion. Past proposals to convert Mission Boulevard to a freeway or build a 238 bypass have been controversial. One proposal, to build a freeway parallel to Mission Boulevard, extending a freeway south from 580 where it turns east towards Castro Valley, and connecting to Industrial Boulevard, had land purchased, but was cancelled in 2004 after years of debate. The land is now scheduled for sale and zoning.

Mission, Jackson, and Foothill all converge at one congested intersection south of downtown, known historically as &quot;Five Flags&quot; for a line of flagpoles located there. To alleviate congestion in the downtown area, the city has converted the A Street, Mission and Foothill triangle to one-way thoroughfares (counterclockwise), and is adding road improvements, landscaping, and telephone/cable undergrounding to Mission Boulevard south to Industrial Boulevard, and to Foothill Boulevard north to 580.

<doc id="107337" wikidata="Q138901" url="?curid=107337" title="Livermore, California">
<text>Livermore is a city in Alameda County, California. With a 2020 population of 87,955, Livermore is the most populous city in the Tri-Valley, giving its name to the Livermore Valley. It is located on the eastern edge of California&#x27;s San Francisco Bay Area, making it the easternmost city in the area.

Livermore was a railroad town named for Robert Livermore, a local rancher who settled in the area in the 1840s. It is the home of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, for which the chemical element livermorium is named (and thus, placing the city&#x27;s name in the periodic table). It is also the California site of Sandia National Laboratories, which is headquartered in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Its south side is home to local vineyards, and its downtown district is being redeveloped .

The United States Census Bureau defines an urban area of Tri-Valley-area cities, with Livermore as the principal city: the Livermore–Pleasanton–Dublin, CA urban area had a 2020 population of 240,381, making it the 167th largest in the United States.

== History ==

=== Pre-contact ===
The valley and upland areas, where contemporary Livermore is located, was home to Chochenyo speaking peoples. As a group, these people are considered Ohlone Costonoan with distinct cultural affiliation in contrast to and closely bordering the Bay Miwok to the north and the Valley Yokuts to the east. Four tribelets, the Yulien, Ssaoam, Ssouyn, and the Pelnen occupied the valley floor with territory extending into the hills. Semi-permanent villages were located near water drainages at the valley floor within the current urban limits of Livermore with seasonal camps in the surrounding uplands.

=== 1700s ===
A Spanish expedition led by Pedro Fages skirted the western edge of Livermore Valley in 1772. Shortly afterwards, the Spanish Mission of San Jose was founded in 1797 on the slopes of what is modern day Fremont. Mission San Jose viewed the people and land stretching to the east as under their control. Livermore Valley was called the Valley of San Jose by the Friars and actively recruited native peoples of the valley into the mission system. In contrast, the valley was also used as a staging area for raids on Mission San Jose by neighboring tribes in this early period and beyond.

=== 1800s ===
During the first seven years of the 1800s, five hundred and two individuals were baptized at Mission San Jose from the four tribelets in the Livermore Valley. In this time, Spanish military conducted raids throughout the East Bay using the valley as a natural corridor for movement. Deaths from measles outbreaks were recorded in Mission San Jose in 1806 which forced recruiting beyond the Livermore Valley and into the Altamont range. The Livermore-Amador Valley from 1800 to about 1837 was primarily used as grazing land for the Mission San Jose&#x27;s growing herds of cattle, sheep and horses. The valley helped San Jose Mission emerge as one of the more wealthy Spanish enclaves. As a result of the secularization of the mission system, in 1839, two large ranchos were created that encompassed the Livermore Valley; Rancho Las Positas and Rancho Valle de San Jose. Many Native groups left the San Jose Mission during this period and reestablished themselves in communities in the East Bay, including the Livermore Valley. Because indigenous food resources there were depleted, they tried to support themselves by working as laborers. But as the population grew thanks to the Gold Rush which started in 1848 and the workers on the railroad, it became more and more difficult to find work; by 1906, there were only 28 individuals left, and by 1914 most of the remaining population was gone.

==== Rancho Las Positas ====

Robert Livermore (1799–1858), the namesake of the town, was a British citizen who had jumped from a British merchant sailing ship stopping in Monterey, California. In 1839, the Rancho Las Positas grant, which includes most of Livermore, was made to ranchers Robert Livermore and Jose Noriega.

In the early 1840s Livermore moved his family from the Sunol Valley to the Rancho Las Positas grant, as the second non-native family to settle in the Livermore valley area. In 1847, after the Americans took control of California and gold was discovered in 1848, he started making money by selling California longhorn cattle to the thousands of hungry California Gold Rush miners who soon arrived. The non-Indian population skyrocketed, and cattle were suddenly worth much more than the $1.00-$3.00 their hides could bring. Livermore&#x27;s ranch became a popular &quot;first day&quot; stopping point for prospectors and businessmen leaving San Francisco or San Jose and headed for Sacramento and the Mother Lode gold country. Most horse traffic went by way of Altamont Pass just east of Livermore. Because Livermore would offer food and shelter to those passing by, the valley eventually became known as &quot;Livermore&#x27;s Valley&quot;, and is still known as the Livermore Valley today.

==== Founding ====

Robert Livermore died in 1858. The first significant settlement in the valley was Laddsville, a small settlement of about 75 which had grown up around the hotel established by Alponso Ladd around 1864 on 160 acres of land he bought. After the hotel and a house were initially built, another home, a blacksmith, a saloon, and a general store followed in the same year. The first schoolhouse was built in 1866.

Livermore&#x27;s founder, William Mendenhall, was another landowner in the Livermore Valley, having bought 650 acres of the Santa Rita grant and 608 acres of the Rancho Valle de San José. In 1869, he set aside of his land for a townsite, creating a new town which he named Livermore, after his friend Robert Livermore. Livermore was platted and registered on November 4, 1869, as a railroad town. By that time, the valley had already become known as Livermore&#x27;s Valley. He had first met Livermore while marching through the valley with John C. Fremont&#x27;s California Battalion in 1846 as they were recruited to occupy the surrendering Californio towns captured by the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Pacific Squadron. He also donated of this land to the Western Pacific Railroad, which in September 1869 placed a station on the land William Mendenhall had donated. The land for the tracks had already been signed over by Robert Livermore from his ranch in 1855, as surveyors had determined it was the best place to build. The original railroad tracks went from Alameda Terminal to Sacramento over the nearby Altamont Pass in the east and Niles Canyon on the west.

After it was destroyed by a fire in 1871, Laddsville gradually merged into Livermore. The railroad significantly accelerated Livermore&#x27;s growth, and the incorporation of Laddsville into the city added impetus; the city was officially incorporated by the state on April 1, 1876. At the time the town had a population of about 830 people in 234 buildings. It had 13 saloons.

==== Early Livermore ====

In the early days, the income of the town of Livermore mainly came from wheat. The city also developed as a place for the shipping and processing of products of the valley, including cattle, roses, and white wines, the last especially prominent after the 1880s. Some other contributors to the town&#x27;s prosperity were coal and oil deposits in the surrounding hills. 

Coal was first found in Harrisville, and in 1875 the Livermore Coal Company was formed. Extensive deposits of coal were also mined in the nearby Corral Hollow, which was briefly the largest coal producer in California between 1895 and 1905. The ghost towns of Tesla and Carnegie were satellite towns of Livermore at the time. 

Livermore&#x27;s wine industry grew after the 1880s, and it became notable for wineries like Wente Vineyards, Concannon Vineyards, and Cresta Blanca Winery. Since it has a Mediterranean climate, gravelly soil, warm days and cool nights, it was a good location to grow wine grapes. By 1880 the wheat and barley fields were being replaced by vineyards. As well as the main products of the town, extensive chromite deposits were found nearby and exploited for a time. Magnesite deposits were exploited on Red Mountain, near the end of Mines Road. The Remillard Brick Company was also in Livermore in 1885, and was producing an extensive line of bricks and employing over 100 men.

Private grade schools were operating in Livermore from the 1860s on. The Livermore Collegiate Institute was founded in 1870, and Union High School (later called Livermore High School) graduated its first class of students in 1896. There was an old bullfight ring that survived until at least 1870. By 1876 the town had grown and a fire company, churches, a bank, and a library were built. Livermore was officially incorporated by the state as a city in April 1876.

During Livermore&#x27;s early years, before and after it was incorporated, it was well known for large hotels that graced the downtown street corners, before new buildings replaced them. A telephone line connected Livermore to Arroyo Valley by 1886, and electric lights were introduced by 1888. By 1890 Livermore had over of streets. Livermore originally had a Boot Hill called the Oak Knoll Cemetery, Livermore&#x27;s first public cemetery, but it was formally abandoned after becoming less popular and being devastated by natural disasters in the 1900s, and is now used for athletics at Granada High School.

=== 1900s ===

During the late 19th century and early 20th century, the Livermore Valley attracted the creation of sanitariums due to the warm climate and clean air. From 1894 to 1960, the Livermore Sanitarium was in operation for the treatment of alcoholism and mental disorders; and from 1918 to around 1960, the Arroyo del Valle Sanitarium was in operation in the town for the treatment of tuberculosis. The city once had a slogan &quot;Live Longer with Livermore&quot;.

In 1909, the Livermore Carnegie Library and Park opened, taking advantage of a Carnegie library grant. As the city grew and larger libraries were needed, other libraries were built, and the original site was converted into a historic center and park.

The community was primarily agricultural until 1945, and transitioned to a suburb as a result of construction of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in 1952 and the Sandia National Laboratories in 1956, and population overflow from the rest of the bay area.

In 1942, the U.S. government bought of ranch land, and built the Livermore Naval Air Station. The primary mission of the base was to train Navy pilots for World War II. This facility operated until it was decommissioned in 1946 after the end of the war. On January 5, 1951, the Bureau of Yards and Docks, U.S. Navy, formally transferred the former NAS Livermore in its entirety to the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) for use by the University of California&#x27;s Radiation Laboratory. In 1952, the government established Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), named after physicist Ernest O. Lawrence, as the site of a second laboratory for the study of nuclear energy like the research being done at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The laboratory was run by the University of California. Edward Teller was a co-founder of LLNL and was both its director and associate director for many years. In 1956, the California campus of Sandia National Laboratories opened across East Avenue from LLNL. Both LLNL and Sandia are technically on U.S. government property just outside the city&#x27;s jurisdiction limits, but with employment at LLNL at about 6,800 and Sandia/California at about 1,150 they are Livermore&#x27;s largest employers.

A number of historic buildings from the 1800s were razed in the 1960s to build fast food and other modern structures in their place.

The town grew rapidly in population in the 1990s when many people in Bay Area moved farther away from the urban core.

==Geography==
The Livermore Valley is located within the Diablo Range, one of several parts of the California Coast Ranges that surround the San Francisco Bay Area. The Livermore Valley has an east–west orientation with mountain passes on the west and east connecting the Bay Area and the Central Valley. The passes are used by railroads and highways to connect the two regions. Livermore Valley is about long (east to west) and wide (north to south).

Watercourses draining the city of Livermore include Arroyo Mocho, Arroyo Valle, Arroyo Seco and Arroyo Las Positas. The principal aquifer underlying the city is the Mocho Subbasin. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , over 99% of it land. Several local seismic areas of activity lie near the city, including the Greenville Fault, Tesla Fault and the Livermore Fault.

The soil is primarily gravel with excellent drainage. The gravel is used in several gravel extraction sites outside the city. The gravelly soil and Mediterranean climate increases the flavor concentration in the grapes planted in the soil.

===Climate===
Livermore has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa), although it is close to a semi-arid climate because of its relatively low annual precipitation, due to being in the rain shadow of the western portions of the Diablo Range. Livermore features hot, dry summers and cool winters with occasional rainfall. The valley&#x27;s passes direct the normal west to east flow of air through the valley. Usually there is a strong evening wind in the summer that brings cool air off the Pacific Ocean into the Livermore valley as it heads towards the much hotter Central Valley. This wind is strong enough with an average summer wind speed of about and predictable enough to encourage the use of the wind turbines in the Altamont Pass between the cities of Livermore and Tracy. The period from June to September is extremely dry and is characterized by clear skies. On rare occasion, subtropical moisture occasionally surges into the Livermore Valley in the late summer. This can bring high humidity, monsoon clouds, and, much less commonly, thunderstorms.

Snow is very rare, but light dustings do occur on the surrounding hills and occasionally in the valley, such as in 2023, 2021, and 2009.


==Demographics==
===2020 Census===
===2010 Census===
The 2010 United States Census reported that Livermore had a population of 80,968. The population density was . The homeowner vacancy rate was 1.5%; the rental vacancy rate was 4.8%. 56,967 people (70.4% of the population) lived in owner-occupied housing units and 23,491 people (29.0%) lived in rental housing units.

According to the 2010 census information, Livermore is the third wealthiest midsize (between 65,000 and 249,999 people) city in the nation. In 2005, the median household income in Livermore was $96,632, which ranked it the third highest-income midsize city, behind only the California cities of Newport Beach ($97,428) and Livermore&#x27;s western neighbor, Pleasanton ($101,022).

As of October 2019, there were 53,792 registered voters in Livermore; of these, 21,158 (39.93%) are Democrats, 15,061 (28.00%) are Republicans, and 14,499 (26.95%) are independents/decline to state.

==Economy==

===Laboratories===
The Livermore area is the home of two US Department of Energy National Laboratories. The laboratories are known worldwide, and attract significant attention both for their scientific research and for their major roles in developing the United States nuclear arsenal.

The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) is the largest employer in Livermore, as of 2022, employing about 15% of the population. LLNL&#x27;s defining responsibility is to &quot;ensure the safety, security and reliability of the nation’s nuclear deterrent,&quot; but it also does a wide variety of other research, including co-discovering livermorium.

Livermore is also the California site of Sandia National Laboratories, the second largest employer in Livermore (employing about 3%). It also describes itself as being focused on &quot;national security&quot;. It is managed and operated by a subsidiary of Honeywell International.

===i-GATE===
In 2010, the two National Laboratories, along with other stakeholders, including the University of California, Berkeley, UC Davis, and regional cities, partnered to create the i-GATE (Innovation for Green Advanced Transportation Excellence) National Energy Systems Technology (NEST) Incubator, part of the Central Valley. The i-GATE NEST campus was created to stimulate large-scale, high-tech business development drawn by the two labs. Initial focus of the campus was solar energy, fuel cells, biofuels, LED lighting, and other related technologies. i-GATE shares its facilities with the hackerspace Robot Garden, which provides public access on weekends.

=== Wine ===
One of California&#x27;s oldest wine regions, the Livermore Valley American Viticultural Area (AVA) played a pivotal role in shaping California&#x27;s wine industry. In the 1840s, California pioneers looking for outstanding vineyard sites began planting grapes in the region. Robert Livermore planted the first commercial vines in the 1840s. After California joined the union as the 31st state in 1850, pioneer winemakers C. H. Wente, a first-generation immigrant from Germany (founder of Wente Vineyards), James Concannon, a first generation Irishman (founder of Concannon Vineyard), and Charles Wetmore, a Portland, Maine-born pioneer of California (founder of Cresta Blanca Winery), recognized the area&#x27;s winegrowing potential and bought land, planted grapes and founded their wineries in the 1880s.

Charles Wetmore went to France in 1878 when he was appointed a delegate for the California Viticultural Association to the Paris Exposition. Wetmore was able in 1882 to obtain Semillon, Sauvignon Blanc, and Muscat de Bordelais cuttings from one of the most prestigious vineyards in France, Chateau Yquem. These superior clones helped revitalize the California wine industry. In 1889 Wetmore won the grand prize for his first pressing (1884) in the 1889 Paris Exposition. Wetmore shared these cuttings with other growers, including C. H. Wente, who used the Chateau Yquem grape cuttings to eventually produce their Chateau Wente wine.

===Top employers===

According to the city&#x27;s 2022 Annual Comprehensive Financial Report, the top employers in Livermore are:

Gillig Corporation, a large manufacturer of buses, moved its factory to Livermore in May 2017 and, at the time of the move, the company estimated its employment at the new facility to be 800 initially and 850 after the filling of then-open positions.

Livermore&#x27;s largest employers, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratory are United States Department of Energy National Laboratories, located inside the city limits since 2011, and are included in the above table.

Architectural Glass and Aluminum moved its headquarters to Livermore in 2013, with 80 employees. They expanded and changed to 100% employee ownership in 2015.

==Arts and culture==

Livermore&#x27;s culture retains some vestiges of the farming, winegrowing and ranching traditions that have existed in the valley since the time of Robert Livermore, but now largely reflects a suburban population. Since 1918, Livermore has each June hosted the Livermore Rodeo, called the &quot;World&#x27;s Fastest Rodeo&quot;, that claims it has more riders per hour than any other event of its type. There are several wine-tasting tours of the many Livermore area wineries that occur periodically throughout the summer. Livermore has a strong blue-collar element, as well as many professionals who work at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and other work sites in the high tech industries within the Bay Area.

One of the largest districts in Livermore is Springtown, the northeast area of the city north of Interstate 580. Originally conceived as a retirement community in the early 1960s, Springtown has slowly transformed into a community of young families and commuters from the greater Bay Area. The North Livermore district is north of the Union Pacific Railroad that cuts through downtown. The South Livermore district, including areas of unincorporated land, has over 40 wineries. Livermore has a seasonal local farmers market on Thursdays.

The first Camp Wonder, a summer camp for children with special medical needs, was opened in Livermore in 2001. In 2019, a local LGBT organization, Livermore Pride, was founded. On its leadership team is Brittni Kiick, the city&#x27;s vice mayor and first openly LGBTQ+ councilmember. Livermore was one of 10 cities to be awarded an All-America City Award during the annual National Civic League ceremony for 2021. The theme of the 2021 awards was &quot;Building Equitable and Resilient Communities.&quot; The Livermore Public Library has a front mosaic by Maria Alquilar. 

The official city flower is the Livermore tarplant, an endangered plant that only grows near Livermore.

=== World&#x27;s longest-lasting light bulb ===
The city is noted for one world record. A 120+ year old 4-watt light bulb, called the Centennial Light, housed in the Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department Firehouse Six, is still burning. Originally installed by Augustus Donner Wilson, the bulb has been maintained through successive generations until his great-great-granddaughter Alissa Wilson. It glows dimly, but still functions as a light bulb. The &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot;, &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot;, and General Electric have concluded that the bulb has been burning continuously since 1901 with the exception of power failures and the three times it was disconnected for moves to new stations. The light bulb was manufactured by the Shelby Electric Company and was hand blown with a carbon filament.

=== Media ===
Radio station KKIQ is licensed in Livermore and broadcasts in the Tri-Valley area. &quot;The Independent&quot; is a local newspaper founded in September 1963. It is located in the Bank of Italy building.

== Parks and recreation ==

The Livermore Area Recreation and Park District (LARPD) is a special independent park district that was created by the vote of the public in 1947 and runs the parks and other facilities in the city of Livermore and most of the unincorporated areas of eastern Alameda County. LARPD has its own, five-person board of directors that is elected by the citizens to staggered four-year terms.

As of 2013, LARPD operates 42 facilities over , with open space. It runs an extensive selection of classes on a wide variety of subjects. The 2012-2013 operating budget of LARPD was $16,393,564 plus a capital budget of $3,870,971. LARPD serves an area that encompasses about 115,000 people.

The extensive gravel deposits around Livermore have led to extensive gravel extraction that is still ongoing. Shadow Cliffs Park along Stanley Boulevard west of Livermore is a popular park that includes an lake in an old Kaiser Industries gravel pit and is used extensively today for swimming, boating, and fishing.

== Government ==

Livermore is run by a council–manager government with a four-member City Council, a Mayor, and a City Manager chosen by the city council. The City Manager is “hired” by the City Council, and can, in principle, be fired by them. Twice a month, the City Council hears citizen input and relays this information to the City Manager, who actually runs the city from day to day. The city council members are elected every 4 years, with one council member being elected to represent one of the 4 districts. The mayor is elected at large every 2 years, and the city manager is chosen by the city council every 5 years.

The mayor of Livermore is John Marchand, who was elected in 2022 and previously served as mayor from 2011 to 2020. The four councilmembers are Evan Branning, (District 1), Ben Barrientos (District 2), Brittni Kiick (the district 3), and Bob Carling (District 4). The vice mayor is a member of the council, Brittni Klick. The City Manager is Marianna Marysheva, and the City Attorney is Jason Alcala. In the California State Legislature, Livermore is in , and in . In the United States House of Representatives, Livermore is in California&#x27;s 14th congressional district, represented by Democrat Eric Swalwell.

As of 2013, unions and bargaining units which had made agreements with Livermore included the Livermore Management Group, the Association of Livermore Employees (ALE), the Police Management, the Police Officers Association, and the Livermore-Pleasanton Firefighters (IAFF).

===General Plan===
The city of Livermore has a long-term General Plan which guides its decisions about topics, including transportation, jobs, housing, parks, shopping, and services. This plan is updated about every 10 to 20 years, and the city began the process of updating it in 2021, planning to finish by early 2024, under the name of &quot;Imagine Livermore 2045&quot;. The city council appointed a General Plan Advisory Committee.

== Education ==
The public schools in Livermore are part of the Livermore Valley Joint Unified School District (LVJUSD). The district has 11 elementary (K-5 and K-8) schools, three middle schools (grades 6–8), two comprehensive high schools, and three alternative high schools.

LVJUSD&#x27;s Board of Education has five members, who are elected to alternating four year terms by the voters of the community. Each December, the board reorganizes itself by selecting a board president and clerk of the board.

The Hertz Foundation for scholarships is based in Livermore.

=== Charter schools shutdown ===
There were two charter schools in Livermore, one K-8 and one high school, both operated by the Tri-Valley Learning Corporation, a local 501(c)3 not-for-profit organization formed by the parents and teachers who founded the two charter schools. 
* Livermore Valley Charter School (LVCS): a K-8 public school
* Livermore Valley Charter Preparatory (LVCP): a high school, opened in fall of 2010

Both schools were effectively shut down by the beginning of the 2018 school year amidst accusations of embezzlement, exchange student fraud, and the loss of their UC accreditation. The displaced students were absorbed by the new Lawrence Elementary school and Las Positas Community College Middle College. About 400 parents pulled their children out of the schools in 2016, during a time in which the schools were being investigated for problems including not paying rent, not paying teachers, and involuntarily transferring foreign exchange students to Stockton.

==Infrastructure==
=== Transportation ===
Interstate 580 is Livermore&#x27;s primary east–west freeway. I-580 passes the outskirts of Livermore before it heads east through the Altamont Pass to the Central Valley and Interstate 5. I-580 and I-5 are the main route of San Francisco Bay Area to Los Angeles truck shipping traffic. Interstate 680 lies about west of Livermore. Highway 84 heads southwest from I-580 to Fremont. Vasco Road, an unnumbered highway that is maintained by Alameda and Contra Costa counties, connects Livermore to Brentwood and the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta area.

Livermore Municipal Airport (LVK) is located northwest of Livermore and is a division of the Public Works Department; it is owned and operated by the City of Livermore. It is the main airport in the Tri-Valley area. Approximately 600 aircraft are based on Livermore Airport, which has over 150,000 annual aircraft landings and take-offs each year. The airport serves private, business, and corporate tenants and customers and covers about . The main lighted runway is long. The main terminal building covers . The airfield is accessible 24 hours a day and is attended by city employees during the hours listed under &quot;Airport Services&quot;. The staffed air traffic control tower is operated by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) employees daily from 7:00 A.M. until 9:00 P.M. There is an open airshow which is held annually on the first Saturday of October from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM showing vintage World War II aircraft and other displays.

The WHEELS bus system operates in Livermore, Pleasanton, Dublin, and the surrounding unincorporated areas of Alameda County. It has connections to Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) stations in Dublin and Pleasanton.

Livermore has two stations for the Altamont Corridor Express (ACE), a commuter train which runs from Stockton to the San Jose area. One station is at Vasco Road, and the other is in downtown Livermore at its Transit Center. The Transit Center has a free multistory parking garage and connections to the WHEELS bus system.

There was a petition drive to bring the Bay Area Rapid Transit system to Livermore led by a group founded by Linda Jeffery Sailors, the former mayor of Dublin who was successful in extending BART to Dublin/Pleasanton (the closest station to Livermore at that time). In May 2018, the BART board of directors voted against extending BART to Livermore. As a result, the Tri-Valley–San Joaquin Valley Regional Rail Authority was formed to establish a rail connection between the existing BART system and the Altamont Corridor Express. The service, known as Valley Link, intends to build new rail stations at Isabel Avenue and Southfront Road for service.

=== Police ===
The Livermore Police Department (LPD) was established in 1876, at that time the only law enforcement agency in the San Francisco Bay Area besides the San Francisco Police Department. The LPD has 135 members including 90 sworn officers and 45 non-sworn full-time personnel who operate on a $25 million budget each year.

=== Fire department ===

The Livermore-Pleasanton Fire Department provides fire and advanced life support services to the cities of Livermore and Pleasanton. It serves an estimated population of 150,000 (78,000 in Livermore, and 71,000 in Pleasanton) over ( in Livermore, and in Pleasanton) with an operating budget of $28 million. In 2008 the LPFD responded to approximately 11,000 calls for service. The International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) Local 1974 represents its 112 members.

<text>Newark ( ) is a city in Alameda County, California, United States. It was incorporated as a city in September 1955. Newark is an enclave, surrounded by the city of Fremont. The three cities of Newark, Fremont, and Union City make up the Tri-City Area. Newark&#x27;s population was 47,529 at the 2020 census making it the third largest city in the US named Newark after Newark, New Jersey, and Newark, Ohio.

==History==
Newark was named after Newark Castle, Port Glasgow, in Scotland by J. Barr Robertson.

Before it was settled by Europeans, Newark was home to the Ohlone Native American Peoples. The first European settlement in the area was by the Spanish missionaries of Mission San José, whose territory covered much of the present-day cities of Newark, Fremont, and Union City. In 1878 land belonging to Washington Township of Alameda County was purchased by The Pacific Land Investment Company and subdivided to form the town of Newark.

In the early 1950s, the amalgamation of towns was increasing in Alameda County. In 1953, residents in the towns surrounding Newark were concerned about being annexed into the nearby city of Hayward, and began plans to incorporate as a single city, eventually becoming Fremont. Driven by their own concerns of being forced to amalgamate into this new city and the resulting changes in zoning, Newark was incorporated in September 1955, before the incorporation of Fremont was completed.

<doc id="107339" wikidata="Q570301" url="?curid=107339" title="Piedmont, California">
<text>Piedmont is a small city located in Alameda County, California, United States, enclaved by the city of Oakland. Its residential population was 11,270 at the 2020 census. The name comes from the region of Piedmont in Italy, and it means &#x27;foothill&#x27;. Piedmont was incorporated in 1907, and was developed significantly in the 1920s and 1930s.

== History ==
The original neighborhood of Piedmont was larger than the current municipality of Piedmont, with the Mountain View Cemetery considered full part of the Piedmont neighborhood.

Residents initially sought incorporation in 1907. Two elections were held among the citizens of Piedmont in 1907, both of which narrowly upheld the decision for Piedmont to become a separate city, rather than become a neighborhood within the city of Oakland.

According to the city&#x27;s webpage, &quot;In the Roaring Twenties, Piedmont was known as the &#x27;City of Millionaires&#x27; because there were more millionaires per square mile than in any city in the United States.&quot; Many of these millionaires built mansions that still stand, notably on Sea View Avenue and Sotelo Avenue/Glen Alpine Road in &#x27;Alta&#x27; Piedmont. Piedmont became a charter city under the laws of the state of California on December 18, 1922. On February 27, 1923, voters adopted the charter, which can only be changed by another vote of the people.

Like surrounding Oakland, Piedmont has a history of racial segregation, but it also has a separate history of racial exclusion. In 1924, the city&#x27;s first African-American homeowners, Sidney and Irene Dearing, got around the city&#x27;s restrictive housing covenants by purchasing a home using a white family member as a proxy. They could not count on the city of Piedmont to protect them from violent threats against their lives—the chief of police at the time, Burton Becker, was an active member of the Ku Klux Klan. While the Dearings initially refused to leave, bombs were left around their property. They couple sold their property to the city for $25,000 after a mob surrounded their home and demanded that they leave.

Before 1968, restrictive housing covenants and redlining were used to exclude non-whites in the city for many years. The American sociologist and historian James W. Loewen identified Piedmont as a &quot;probable&quot; sundown town, meaning that non-whites were not welcome after dusk and could face violence and intimidation. While surrounding Oakland is one of the most ethnically and culturally diverse cities in the United States, Piedmont has a less racially diverse population. Attempts to ethnically and culturally diversify the city and allow for higher density and affordable housing are typically met with resistance from the city&#x27;s residents.

In early 2021, the city council indicated that it intended &quot;to move forward with public acknowledgement and an apology for the abhorrent treatment Sidney Dearing and his family received in 1924.&quot;

In August 2017, the mayor of Piedmont, Jeffrey Wieler, resigned after making disparaging Facebook posts about Black Lives Matter and transgender people.

== Geography ==
Piedmont is located near the Hayward Fault, a geological fault line that runs through the East Bay region. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land.

=== Borders ===
Piedmont is surrounded on all sides by the city of Oakland. Specifically, Piedmont&#x27;s northwestern border is adjacent to Oakland&#x27;s Piedmont Avenue commercial district. The city borders Oakland&#x27;s historic Grand Lake District (Lakeshore and Grand Avenue commercial districts) to the southwest, the quaint and rustic Montclair District to the northeast, and the Crocker Highlands and Glenview Districts to the south.

=== Major streets ===
Piedmont&#x27;s major streets include Oakland Avenue, which runs east-west through Piedmont&#x27;s small city center; Highland Avenue, which divides Piedmont into upper and lower sections; Moraga Avenue, which runs along the city&#x27;s northern border; and Grand Avenue, which runs near Piedmont&#x27;s western border and further distinguishes &#x27;Lower&#x27; Piedmont (west of Highland Ave) from &#x27;Baja&#x27; Piedmont (west of Grand Avenue). Lots in upper Piedmont are, on average, larger than lots in lower Piedmont. A nearby shopping district on Piedmont Avenue is located in Oakland, not Piedmont. A small shopping hamlet had been located on Highland Avenue near the Exedra at Piedmont Park for many years, but in the last few decades has dwindled in number to a small, local grocer-deli (Mulberry&#x27;s Market), a service station and three banks. No major highways run within Piedmont&#x27;s borders, but entrances to CA Highway 13 and CA I-580 are quite near.

=== Housing ===
The city is almost entirely zoned for single-family dwelling residential use. Piedmont has minimal commerce compared with statistically similar cities and relies primarily on property taxes and fees for public revenues to support public services. The city also has relatively few multi-family or second (in-law) units. The city has a very small number of businesses in its commercial district on Highland Avenue and a very small number of businesses on Grand Avenue near Piedmont&#x27;s western border with Oakland.

== Emergency services ==
Piedmont provides its own fire, police, parks, and recreational services but does not have its own public library nor federal post office; these services are shared with Oakland. Special, incremental property tax assessments on Piedmont real estate for schools and some public services are not shared with Oakland.

From its incorporation until 1992, Piedmont was a Republican stronghold in presidential elections.

== Education ==

Elementary and secondary students (PK-12) residing in Piedmont, children of City of Piedmont employees, and children of Piedmont Unified School District employees are eligible to attend schools within the Piedmont Unified School District. The district, coinciding with the municipal boundaries, includes three elementary schools (Havens, Beach, and Wildwood), one middle school (Piedmont Middle School), and two high schools—one larger (Piedmont High School), and one smaller, alternative high school, Millennium High School. A very high percentage of Piedmont High School graduates are accepted to 4-year undergraduate programs. Many graduates continue their post-secondary education at very prestigious and competitive public and private colleges and universities.

The Piedmont Unified School District currently ranks #68 of 756 districts in the state of California according to one statistical analysis of California public education.

Piedmont voters have approved several local bond measures earmarked for maintaining and/or improving PUSD&#x27;s educational facilities. For instance, Witter Field, PUSD&#x27;s sports complex, was rebuilt between 1996 and 1999. The city-owned field adjacent to Beach Elementary School was resurfaced with natural cork-based artificial turf in early 2015. The PUSD-owned artificial turf field at Havens Elementary School (Becker Playfield) was placed in 2010.

Most recently, with the passage of Measure E in 2006, voters authorized the Piedmont Unified School District to issue up to $56 million in bonds to improve Piedmont public school buildings to reduce dangers from earthquakes, eliminate major collapse risks, and to meet or exceed all current state and federal seismic safety standards.

In addition to the public bond measures approved for PUSD facility upgrades and modernization, Piedmont voters have quadrennially approved, since 1980, a supplemental parcel tax (collected annually) which accounts for a very significant portion of PUSD&#x27;s basic operational budget. In 2005, two measures were approved by voters, one of which renewed the basic school district parcel tax, paying for 21% of the district&#x27;s budget, and another which added an incremental amount, short-term, to compensate for reduced funding from mainly state, and some federal, sources. Piedmont&#x27;s most recent school support tax, Measure A, was again approved by 88% of Piedmont voters in 2012. Due to further reductions in state education budgets during the Great Recession (2007-2009), state diversions from local school property tax allocations since 2004, and shifting of state financial responsibilities onto local school districts, Piedmont&#x27;s local school parcel tax now represents 30% of PUSD&#x27;s annual operating budget.

Piedmont High School hosts the annual Leonard J. Waxdeck Bird Calling Contest every spring;the top three winners used to appear on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; and perform their bird calls.

The Piedmont Educational Foundation awards a number of grants for academic innovation in Piedmont schools each year, and provides a source of operational funding for the PUSD through its Endowment Fund which reached $6 million in 2015.

== Media ==
The city is served by two local weekly newspapers: the &quot;Piedmont Post&quot; and the &quot;Piedmonter&quot;, a neighborhood newspaper organized under the &quot;Contra Costa Times&quot; news organization.

== Transportation ==

AC Transit provides Piedmont with bus service. Bus routes 12 and 33 connect Piedmont to Oakland&#x27;s BART stations. In addition to Route 33 serving BART stations, the route serves Upper Piedmont going to Estates Drive on weekdays. AC Transit also provides a Transbay bus. Route P, to the Transbay Terminal in Downtown San Francisco during peak commute hours.

<text>Pleasanton is a city in Alameda County, California, United States. Located in the Amador Valley, it is a suburb in the East Bay region of the San Francisco Bay Area. The population was 79,871 at the 2020 census. In 2005 and 2007, Pleasanton was ranked the wealthiest middle-sized city in the United States by the Census Bureau. Pleasanton is home to the headquarters of Safeway, Workday, Ellie Mae, Roche Molecular Diagnostics, Blackhawk Network Holdings, Veeva Systems, and Simpson Manufacturing Company. Other major employers include Kaiser Permanente, Oracle and Macy&#x27;s. Although Oakland is the Alameda County seat, a few county offices are located in Pleasanton. The Alameda County Fairgrounds are located in Pleasanton, where the county fair is held during the last week of June and the first week of July. Pleasanton Ridge Regional Park is located on the west side of town.

== History ==

=== Pre-contact ===
The Amador-Livermore Valley, where Pleasanton is located, was home to tribes in the Ohlone language group, mainly speaking Chochenyo. As of the 1770s seven tribes were present in the valley: the Causen, Pelnen, Seunen, Ssaoan, Ssouyen, Taunan, and Yulien. Each had a territory about 10 miles across, living in villages of 60-90 people. The total population of the valley was about 2000-2500 people.

=== 1700s ===
The first Spanish expedition reached the Amador-Livermore Valley in 1772. Native people from the valley began to join Mission Santa Clara, founded in 1777, in small numbers by the 1790s. Large groups began joining missions after Mission San Jose was founded in 1797.

=== 1800s ===
After Mexico independence from Spain in 1821, the missions were secularized, the Native people being emancipated and the land given in the form of ranchos to Spanish and Mexican colonists. Pleasanton is located on the lands of the Rancho Valle de San José and Rancho Santa Rita Mexican land grants.

==== Alisal ====

Before the establishment of Pleasanton in the 1850s, an earlier settlement in the location was called Alisal. It was located on the lands of the Rancho Santa Rita near the site of a Native American ranchera, around the Francisco Solano Alviso Adobe called &quot;El Alisal&quot; (The Sycamores), one of the earliest houses built in the valley in 1844. It is still standing and serves as the centerpiece of the Alviso Adobe Community Park. Alisal, nicknamed &quot;The Most Desperate Town in the West&quot;, was one of the settlements located along &quot;La Vereda del Monte&quot; that was a haunt and refuge of bandits and desperados in the era following the beginning of the California Gold Rush. Main Street shootouts were not uncommon. Banditos such as Claudio Feliz and Joaquin Murrieta ambushed prospectors on their way back from the gold rush fields and then sought refuge in Alisal. In the 1860s Procopio, Narciso Bojorques and others took refuge there. Alisal Elementary School reflects the city&#x27;s original name.

==== Founding ====
The Rancho Valle de San José grant had been given to Agustín and Juan Pablo Bernal and their brothers-in-law Antonio Suñol and Antonio Maria Pico. In order to safeguard the grant from squatters during the Gold Rush in the 1840s-1850s, the Bernal family moved from San José to live on their ranch along with John Kottinger, an Austrian immigrant and a lawyer who had married into the family.

Pleasanton is located on the lands of the Rancho Valle de San José and Rancho Santa Rita Mexican land grants. Its name was chosen in the 1860s by John W. Kottinger, an Alameda County justice of the peace, after his friend, Union army cavalry Major General Alfred Pleasonton. A typographical error by a recording clerk in Washington, D.C., apparently led to the current spelling.

=== 1900s ===
In 1917, Pleasanton was the backdrop for the film &quot;Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm&quot;, starring Mary Pickford. The town was once home to Phoebe Apperson Hearst, who lived in a 50-room mansion on a estate, now the site of Castlewood Country Club.

Radum Plant was a sand and gravel plant opened in 1931 by Henry J. Kaiser Co., at Radum train station, one mile east of Pleasanton.

After World War II, Pleasanton changed from being primarily focused on farming and ranching to being a bedroom community and a place for corporate headquarters due to major growth of the Bay Area.

On the east side of town on Stanley Blvd. near the Livermore border is Shadow Cliffs Regional Park, a lake that permits swimming, fishing, and boating. On the west side is the Pleasanton Ridge with two parks, Pleasanton Ridge and Augustin Bernal Park. Much of Pleasanton is drained by the Arroyo Valle and Arroyo Mocho watercourses. Pleasanton lies along the route of the historic First transcontinental railroad.

==Arts and culture==
===Events and festivals===
Pleasanton maintains regular events for the community. Every Saturday morning a farmers&#x27; market sets up on Angela, off Main Street. There are several parades during the year, commemorating Christmas, Memorial Day, and Veterans Day, as well as kicking off the beginning of the Alameda County Fair and soccer season.

====First Wednesday====
Beginning in the late 1990s, the Pleasanton Downtown Association organized the popular &quot;First Wednesday&quot; celebrations from May through September of each year. On the first Wednesday of summer months, Main Street was blocked to traffic and adopted a street fair atmosphere. Each First Wednesday celebration was given a theme and planned with related activities. At this local event, businesses and organizations from downtown and around the Tri-Valley set up booths in the center of the street. A local band performed in the Inklings coffee house parking lot, which was closed off for dancing. The parking lot was also set up as a beergarden, with beer and wine available for consumption. In 2017, the association announced it was discontinuing the events, and was considering other types of events in future years.

====Friday Concerts in the Park====
Another Pleasanton Downtown Association tradition is the &quot;Friday Concerts in the Park&quot; series. Every Friday from June until September the PDA schedules different local bands to perform in the evenings at the Lions&#x27; Wayside Park off of First Street. The events are free of charge and draw a crowd. Additional seating for &#x27;Concerts in the Park&#x27; is available at Delucchi Park, at the intersection of First Street and Neal Street.

====Fairgrounds====
The Alameda County Fairgrounds is a facility located in Pleasanton. It is home to the annual Alameda County Fair, held since 1912, as well as numerous trade shows and community events including but not limited to the Scottish Games which occur annually on Labor Day weekend. Located on its grounds, the Pleasanton Fairgrounds Racetrack was built in 1858, making it the oldest horse racing track in the United States. There is a 3,000 seat amphitheater, as well as a nine-hole golf course located within the track&#x27;s infield.

The Alameda County Central Railroad Society has maintained a model train exhibit at the fairgrounds since 1959.

====Architecture====
Because of the preservation of Pleasanton&#x27;s historic downtown area, many examples of architectural styles dating back to the mid-19th century exist. Buildings in Gothic Revival, Pioneer, Italianate, Commercial Italianate, Colonial Revival, and Queen Anne styles can be found within walking distance of each other.

One of the icons of downtown Pleasanton is the &quot;Kolln Hardware&quot; building, located at 600 Main Street. It is designed in the Commercial Italianate style, but the prominent five-sided corner tower and a few other features are indicative of the Colonial Revival style. The structure mixes in a little bit of Queen Anne design in the tower and gable. This building was built in 1890 and has always housed a hardware store, first by the Lewis Brothers, then Cruikshank and Kolln. The hardware store has been known as Kolln Hardware since 1933. In 2004, the Kolln Hardware business shut its doors. Bud Cornett, a Pleasanton developer, purchased the landmark and has invested in its renovation and earthquake retrofit. After more than 100 years of serving the community as a hardware store, the space is now occupied by Comerica Bank.

====Firehouse Arts Center====
The Firehouse Arts Center, opened in 2010, is a center of culture and art for Pleasanton. It features a 221-seat theater, the Harrington art gallery, and classrooms for art and drama.

===Hacienda del Pozo de Verona===
Hacienda del Pozo de Verona (The House of the Wellhead of Verona) was destroyed in a fire in 1969. The house was built by architect A. C. Schweinfurth for Phoebe Hearst in 1898. Phoebe Apperson Hearst had the hacienda remodeled and expanded by architect Julia Morgan for use as her primary residence after her husband died. The estate was built upon a rancheria obtained in 1886 by George Hearst, who intended to use the location for a race horse farm. Its name was inspired by the circular, carved marble wellhead purchased by Phoebe and William in Verona, Italy and installed in the middle of the courtyard. The hacienda was the only female-owned estate to be mentioned in Porter Garnett&#x27;s &quot;Stately Homes of California&quot;. The architecture of the hacienda has been called California Mission style by various sources. The original architect used the term &quot;provincial Spanish Renaissance&quot;, while Garnett wrote it would be more accurately called &quot;Hispano-Moresque&quot;. Moorish influence was found throughout the estate, such as in the guardhouses which stood on either side of the courtyard entrance. The hacienda was topped by imported red Spanish tiles and had undecorated walls of white stucco. After Phoebe&#x27;s death in 1919, William had the wellhead and other furniture and objects moved to Hearst Castle at San Simeon and sold the estate.

<text>San Leandro (Spanish for &quot;St. Leander&quot;) is a city in Alameda County, California, United States. It is located in the East Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area; between Oakland to the northwest, and Ashland, Castro Valley, and Hayward to the southeast. The population was 91,008 as of the 2020 census.

== History ==
=== Spanish and Mexican eras ===
The Spanish settlers called these natives &quot;Costeños&quot;, or &#x27;coast people,&#x27; and the English-speaking settlers called them Costanoans. San Leandro was first visited by Europeans on March 20, 1772, by Spanish soldier Captain Pedro Fages and the Spanish Catholic priest Father Crespi.

San Leandro is located on the Rancho San Leandro and Rancho San Antonio Mexican land grants. Its name refers to Leander of Seville, a sixth-century Spanish bishop. Both land grants were located along El Camino Viejo, modern 14th Street / State Route 185.

The smaller land grant, Rancho San Leandro, of approximately , was given to José Joaquín Estudillo in 1842. The larger, Rancho San Antonio, of approximately , was given to another Spanish soldier, Don Luis Maria Peralta, in 1820. Beginning in 1855, two of Estudillo&#x27;s sons-in-law, John B. Ward and William Heath Davis, laid out the townsite that would become San Leandro, bounded by the San Leandro Creek on the north, Watkins Street on the east, Castro Street on the south, and on the west by the longitude lying a block west of Alvarado Street. The city has a historical Portuguese American population dating from the 1880s, when Portuguese laborers from Hawaii or from the Azores began settling in the city and established farms and businesses. By the 1910 census, they had accounted for nearly two-thirds of San Leandro&#x27;s population.

=== American era ===
In 1856, San Leandro became the county seat of Alameda County, but the county courthouse was destroyed there by the devastating 1868 quake on the Hayward Fault. The county seat was then re-established in the town of Brooklyn (now part of Oakland) in 1872.

During the American Civil War, San Leandro and its neighbor, Brooklyn, fielded a California militia company, the Brooklyn Guard.

San Leandro was one of a number of suburban cities built in the post–World War II era of California to have restrictive covenants, which barred property owners in the city from selling properties to African Americans and other minorities. As a result of the covenant, In 1960, the city was almost entirely white (99.3%), while its neighbor city of Oakland had a large African American population. The United States Supreme Court, in &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot;, later declared such covenants unenforceable by the state. San Leandro was an 86.4% white-non-Hispanic community according in the 1970 census. The city&#x27;s demographics began to diversify in the 1980s. By 2010, Asian Americans had become a plurality population in San Leandro, with approximately one-third of the population, with non-Hispanic Whites accounting for 27.1% of the population.

== Geography ==
The San Leandro Hills run above the city to the northeast. In the lower elevations of the city, an upper regionally contained aquifer is located 50 to 100 feet (15 to 30 m) below the surface. At least one deeper aquifer exists approximately 250 feet (75 m) below the surface. Some salt water intrusion has taken place in the San Leandro Cone. Shallow groundwater generally flows to the west, from the foothills toward San Francisco Bay. Shallow groundwater is contaminated in many of the locales of the lower elevation of the city. Contamination by gasoline, volatile organic compounds and some heavy metals has been recorded in a number of these lower-elevation areas.

The trace of the Hayward Fault passes under Foothill Boulevard in San Leandro. Follow the link in the reference to see a series of photos of the fault cutting the asphalt between 1979 and 1987.

San Leandro has long been home to many food-processing operations, and is home to many corporate businesses, such as Ghirardelli, OSIsoft, 21st Amendment Brewery, Begier Buick, and a Coca-Cola plant. Maxwell House operated a coffee roasting plant, where the Yuban brand was produced from 1949 until 2015, when it was closed as part of a cost-cutting plan instituted by parent company Kraft Foods. The city has five major shopping centers: the Bayfair Center, Westgate Center, Greenhouse Shopping Center, Marina Square Center, and Pelton Plaza. Lucky&#x27;s flagship store opened in San Leandro.

Under San Leandro Mayor Stephen H. Cassidy, the city set the goal in 2012 of &quot;becoming a new center of innovation in the San Francisco Bay Area.&quot; San Leandro came &quot;out of the downturn like few places around, attracting tech startups, artists and brewers to a onetime traditional industrial hub.&quot;

In January 2011, Cassidy and Dr. J. Patrick Kennedy, a San Leandro resident and the president and founder of OSIsoft, one of the city&#x27;s largest employers, &quot;began developing the public-private partnership that would become Lit San Leandro,&quot; a high speed, fiber optic broadband network. In October 2011, the city approved the license agreement that allowed the installation of the fiber-optic cables in the existing conduits under San Leandro streets. In 2012, San Leandro was awarded a $2.1 million grant from the U.S. Economic Development Administration to add 7.5 miles to the network. By 2014, the network expansion was completed, bringing the total length of fiber in the city to over 18 miles. The network is capable of transmitting at up to 10 Gbit/s and is currently only available to business users.

The Zero Net Energy Center, which opened in 2013, is a electrician training facility created by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 595 and the Northern California chapter of the National Electrical Contractors Association. Training includes energy-efficient construction methods, while the facility itself operates as a zero-energy building.

According to the San Leandro&#x27;s 2015 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:

The Department of Recreation and Parks for the City of San Leandro also staffs and maintains the Marina Community Center, the San Leandro Senior Community Center and the San Leandro Family Aquatic Center.

<text>San Lorenzo (Spanish for &quot;Saint Laurence&quot;) is a census-designated place (CDP) located in the East Bay of the San Francisco Bay Area in Alameda County, California, United States. The population was 29,581 at the 2020 census. It is an unincorporated community, located at the banks of San Lorenzo Creek. It was originally named &quot;Squattersville&quot; in 1851, but later renamed to San Lorenzo.

In 1944, under contract to the U.S. Navy, The David D. Bohannon Company began construction of San Lorenzo Village, which was one of the nation&#x27;s first planned communities, with parcels designated for schools, churches, parks, and several retail centers. Bohannon&#x27;s pioneering pre-cutting techniques, referred to as the &quot;California method,&quot; were used in later developments, such as the more famous Levittown, Pennsylvania.

== History ==

San Lorenzo is located on the route of El Camino Viejo on land of the former Rancho San Lorenzo, a Mexican land grant given to Guillermo Castro in 1841, and the former Rancho San Leandro, granted to José Joaquin Estudillo in 1842.

Early residents during the California Gold Rush era lived here as squatters along the border between Rancho San Lorenzo and Rancho San Leandro. The informal name given to the area was Squatterville.

The first post office opened in San Lorenzo in 1854.

Many of the early inhabitants are buried in San Lorenzo Pioneer Cemetery, including Moses Wicks, who brought oysters to San Leandro Bay from Patchogue, Long Island. The cemetery is maintained by the county and the Hayward Area Historical Society.

San Lorenzo was mostly farmland, a significant center of production of fruit and flowers, from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century.

In 1944, under contract to the U.S. Navy, The David D. Bohannon Company began construction of San Lorenzo Village, a tract of two- and three-bedroom homes for workers in the East Bay&#x27;s war industries. San Lorenzo Village was one of the nation&#x27;s first planned communities, with parcels designated for schools, churches, parks, and several retail centers. Bohannon&#x27;s pioneering pre-cutting techniques, referred to as the &quot;California method,&quot; were used in later developments, such as the more famous Levittown, Pennsylvania. Home construction continued into the 1950s to accommodate the region&#x27;s booming population.

San Lorenzo Village housing project launched as the largest privately financed housing project on the West Coast during WWII. San Lorenzo Shopping Center became one of the country&#x27;s first planned community shopping centers and was home to the first Mervyn&#x27;s Department Store.

=== Segregation ===
The original San Lorenzo Village homes were restricted to white owners, and re-sale of homes were limited to white owners through racially restrictive covenants on property deeds. &quot;Sales brochures in the early to mid-1950s [...] assured prospective buyers that the village was &quot;a safe investment&quot; because &quot;farsighted protective restrictions ... permanently safeguard your investment.&quot;&quot; These restrictions, among others around fencing and house colors, were enforced by the San Lorenzo Village Association.

Legal enforcement of such covenants was deemed to violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by the Supreme Court in &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot; (1948), meaning that while parties could choose to abide by the covenants, they could no longer be legally used to prevent non-white persons from buying properties with such restrictions. As a general note, without specific reference to San Lorenzo, after &quot;Shelley&quot;, homeowners associations still would bar non-white owners by requiring membership in the association before buying property, and federal and state governments refused to enforce the &quot;Shelley&quot; decision. In San Lorenzo, the black population remained under one-half percent in the early 1970s.

The language of these restrictions, even if not enforceable, may still be on property deeds.

It was incorporated in 1959, combining the communities of Alvarado and Decoto. Alvarado is a California Historical Landmark (#503). The city celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2009.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all land with no bay frontage. The Niles Cone aquifer, managed by the Alameda County Water District, supplies much of the water consumed by Union City. Hayward bounds the city to the north and Fremont and Newark to the south. Union City, Newark and Fremont are known as the Tri-Cities.

According to the 2020 census estimate, the median income for a household in the city is $142,374. Males have a median household income of $59,274 versus $40,625 for females. The per capita income for the city was $31,411. About 4.5% of the population were below the poverty line, including 5.9% of those under age 18 and 6.2% of those age 65 or over.

== History ==
Costanoans (&quot;coastal peoples&quot;) were the first inhabitants, living along Alameda and Dry Creeks. Shell mounds along the sloughs of Alameda Creek near the Alvarado sugar mill contained burial sites. 

The first non-native community was founded in 1850 by John and William Horner, who named it &quot;Union City&quot; after their Sacramento River Steamship, &quot;The Union&quot;. In 1854, it merged with the nearby community of New Haven (founded 1851) to form the town of Alvarado, named after a former Mexican governor, Juan Bautista Alvarado. Alvarado was the first county seat of Alameda County, a designation it lost in 1865 to San Leandro. Further east, Decoto was founded in 1870 as a railroad hub, hosting the first transcontinental railroad. Alvarado-Niles Road, one of the city&#x27;s largest streets, connects the historical Fremont district of Niles with the historical Union City district of Alvarado.

The California Beet Sugar Company, the US&#x27; first successful sugar beet mill, was located in Alvarado and began operations in 1870. The plant was demolished in 1977.

Union City is a former railroad and steel town with an extensive industrial heritage. The Pacific States Steel Company occupied the land behind Union City Station that is redeveloping into the Union City Station District Downtown. The Alvarado and Decoto neighborhoods were both former railroad hubs and active railroad lines bisect both East End and the West Side of town. Trains are a way of life in Union City and natives are accustomed to waiting for Amtrak and freight trains to cross while commuting.

In the 1950s, Alvarado and Decoto – the latter making up the eastern side of the town – were annexation targets of the nearby communities of Newark, Hayward, and what would become Fremont. On January 13, 1959, they decided to incorporate into a single city, and named it after the Horners&#x27; original settlement, Union City. Tom Kitayama served as the city&#x27;s first mayor in 1959 and was involved in Union City politics until his 1991 retirement. The population grew from 6,000 in 1959 to 70,000 in 2020. In 2016, Union City started to rebrand and unveiled a new city seal. Union City opened a new Teen Center in 2018.

<text>Kirkwood (formerly Kirk, Kirkwood&#x27;s, and Roundtop) is an unincorporated community in Alpine and Amador counties, California, United States. Kirkwood&#x27;s main attraction is the Kirkwood Mountain Resort. The town is accessible by State Route 88. Kirkwood is within the Eldorado National Forest. The population was 158 at the 2010 census. For statistical purposes, the United States Census Bureau has defined Kirkwood as a census-designated place (CDP).

==History==
Zack Kirkwood, a cattle rancher who had settled in the area, opened an inn, named Kirkwood&#x27;s, in 1863 with the opening of the Amador/Nevada Wagon Toll Road, the primary route through the Sierra Nevada Mountains. The following year, Alpine County was created and the redrawing of the county borders placed the inn at the convergence of Alpine, El Dorado, and Amador counties (the borders were later changed so that the inn is no longer in El Dorado County, but the original signpost marking the intersection of the three counties is still in the building). Eventually, the inn became a fashionable summer resort.

After Zack&#x27;s death, the inn stayed in the family and continued to operate until 1966, when it was sold to an investment group, who then converted it into the present-day Kirkwood Mountain Resort.

The population was 200 as of the 2020 census, up from 185 in 2010, making it the least populous incorporated city in California. Amador City is also noted for being the smallest city in California by area.

==Geography==
Only from Sutter Creek on Old Highway 49, Amador City is the state&#x27;s smallest incorporated city by area. According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of which is land, making it the smallest city in California by size.

==History==

Amador City was originally settled in 1849 at what is now Turner Road and Amador Creek (an old wagon road between Drytown and Sutter Creek) by several groups of gold panners who were drawn to the area. One of the groups was the Sunol Group. The Sunol group included José María Amador. José María Amador panned the creek, but his primary success was providing supplies that he brought from his rancheria in the San Ramon area. José María Amador left the group after six months, returning to his rancheria. The rancheria had suffered during his absence, and he needed to care for his ailing wife. José María Amador must have made a significant impression among the other panners. The creek, city and County eventually carried the name &quot;Amador&quot;, the city taking its name from the county.

Early in 1851 gold quartz veins were discovered along the same creek but further west. Arrastras were brought to the area to crush the quartz. Shortly stamps mills were brought in to process the hard quartz that the gold veins were embedded in. By September two stamp mills were erected along Amador Creek. These stamp mills were so remarkable that it drew the attention of Eadweard Muybridge. He photographed the area and 3D images taken in 1851 were made of the stamp mills.

Amador City was incorporated as a city on June 2, 1915.

<text>Ione ( ) is a city in Amador County, California. As of the 2020 census the population is 5,141, which is a 35.1% decrease from the 2010 census. Once known as &quot;Bedbug&quot; and &quot;Freeze Out,&quot; Ione was an important supply center on the main road to the Mother Lode and Southern Mines during the California gold rush.

==History==
Ione is the historical home of the Sierra Miwok Indians. In 1840, the future town site became part of the Mexican land grant Rancho Arroyo Seco in Alta California.

The town is located in the fertile Ione Valley; it is believed to have been named by Thomas Brown around 1849 after one of the heroines in Edward Bulwer-Lytton″s drama &quot;The Last Days of Pompeii&quot;, but conflicting legends and sources for the name exist. During the days of the California gold rush, the miners knew the town by the names of &quot;Bedbug&quot; and &quot;Freezeout.&quot; Unlike other communities in Amador County that were founded on gold mining, Ione was a supply center, stage and rail stop, and agricultural hub.

The first post office opened in 1852. The town of Ione continued to grow and prosper after its gold rush founding. The first school was built in 1853. The historic Methodist Church was organized in 1853 and the structure was completed in 1862. The first flour mill was built in 1855. The first brick building was built by Daniel Stewart, D. Stewart Company Store, in 1855 for his general merchandise store. It is still owned and operated by Stewart family descendants.

In March 1865, Camp Jackson was built nearby. It was garrisoned by Company D, 2nd California Volunteer Cavalry, who stayed for three months before moving to a new post.

At the centennial celebration of 1876, Ione had a population of about 600, which included about 100 Chinese who lived in Ione&#x27;s Chinatown. The town included one public school, four churches, four general stores, one meat market, one laundry, one brewery, a restaurant, millinery shop, an art gallery, six saloons, a drug store and barber shop, and many other business establishments. The centennial also celebrated the completion of the Stockton and Ione Railroad, which had been incorporated in 1873 to build a long narrow gauge railroad from Stockton via Linden to Ione. It ceased operations in 1876.

The centennial celebration was the beginning of what is now known as the Ione Homecoming. This annual celebration has been held during the month of May almost every year since that first Centennial celebration in 1876. It is held annually on the second full weekend in May.

The City of Ione was incorporated as a General Law City in 1953.

Ione has many landmarks and historical points of interest. Three are listed as California Historical Landmarks:
* The Preston School of Industry, known as The Castle, was built between 1890–1894 to serve as a school for juveniles referred by the courts. The Castle is not in use, but the Preston Castle Foundation is working to help restore it.

<text>Jackson (formerly, Botilleas, Botilleas Spring, Bottileas, Bottle Spring, and Botellas) is a city in and the county seat of Amador County, California. Its population was 4,651 at the 2010 census, up from 3,989 at the 2000 census. The city is accessible by both State Route 49 and State Route 88.

==Geography and geology==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land. Jackson Creek traverses the city. Alluvial soils such as Pardee cobbly loam is found throughout the Jackson area.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen climate classification, Jackson has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (abbreviated &quot;Csa&quot;).

==History==
===Early history===
The area was inhabited by the Northern Sierra Indians, who occupied areas along creeks, spring, and seep areas, including permanent and seasonal drainages, flat ridges, and terraces. Therefore, areas along watercourses are considered likely locations for prehistoric cultural resources. Permanent villages were usually placed on elevations above seasonal flood levels. Surrounding areas were used for hunting and seed, acorn, and grass gathering.

===Recent history===
Jackson, named after Colonel Alden Jackson, was founded in 1848 around a year-round spring. Settlement of the region by American pioneers was stimulated by the discovery of gold in the Sierra foothills around 1848. The settlement was named for a local lawyer who was liked by miners named Alden Appola Moore Jackson. Although Amador County was an important mining center, its county seat of Jackson was not typical of the early gold camps. The camp grew quickly, as besides being a popular mining spot, it was also a convenient stopping place on the road from Sacramento to the Southern Mines. The camp became an important supply and transportation center for the neighboring towns, and by 1850, its population had reached an estimated 1,500. Jackson grew first as a watering hole for cattle, then as one of the earliest and most durable of the mother lode&#x27;s hard rock mining areas. In 1854, Jackson became the county seat of newly formed Amador County, California. Previously, from 1851 to 1852, it had been the county seat of Calaveras County.

Placer mining gave out by the 1860s, replaced by hard rock mining. One of the town&#x27;s most prominent historical landmarks, the Kennedy Mine, began operation in 1860; at the time of its closure during World War II in 1942, it was the deepest gold mine in North America, at 1802 m (5912 ft). On August 27, 1922, 47 miners became trapped when a fire broke out in the Argonaut mine. All 47 men died in the fire, but the last body was not recovered until over a year later. The Argonaut mine incident was the worst gold mine disaster in US history.

In October 1942, the US government passed the War Production Board Limitation Order, which signaled the demise of gold mining in California. The government needed men for the war and gold was not considered a strategic war metal.

<text>Sutter Creek (formerly spelled Sutter&#x27;s Creek and Suttercreek; formerly named Suttersville) is a city in Amador County, California, United States. The population was 2,501 at the 2010 census, up from 2,303 at the 2000 census. It is accessible via State Route 49.

==History==

The community takes its name from nearby Sutter Creek, which in turn has the name of early California developer John Sutter.

Sutter&#x27;s discovery of gold at nearby Coloma in January 1848 triggered the California Gold Rush. After all his workers left him to go on their own hunts for gold, Sutter moved to Mormon Island with a couple of hands. After about two weeks miners flooded the island, so Sutter and his hands left and returned to Sutter Creek. Sutter said: &quot;I broke up the camp and started on the march further south, and located my next camp on Sutter Creek, now in Amador County, and thought that I should be there alone. The work was going on well for a while, until three or four traveling grog-shops surrounded me, at from one-half to ten miles (16 km) distance from the camp. Then, of course, the gold was taken to these places, for drinking, gambling, etc., and then the following day they were sick and unable to work, and became deeper and more indebted to me, particularly the Kanakas [native Hawaiians].&quot; Shortly thereafter Sutter moved out of Sutter Creek and back to his fort.

Sutter Creek became a destination for fortune hunters. A post office was established in 1852, and Sutter Creek became a town in 1854 that incorporated in 1913.

Although plenty of placer gold was found there, gold-bearing quartz deposits were discovered in 1851, and mining those deposits for gold became the mainstay of the local economy for many years. With the prosperity brought by quartz mining, Sutter Creek became a boomtown. By 1932, the Central Eureka mine, begun in 1869, had reached the level. By 1939, it was the best-paying mine in Sutter Creek. The mines continued operations until 1942, when most gold mines were closed for manpower reasons during World War II.

Today, Sutter Creek is a tourist town with many shops and restaurants. The town itself is registered as California Historical Landmark #322.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 2.6 square miles (6.6 km), all of it land.

<text>Chico ( ; Spanish for &quot;little&quot;) is the most populous city in Butte County, California, United States. Located in the Sacramento Valley region of Northern California, the city had a population of 101,475 in the 2020 census, an increase from 86,187 in the 2010 census. Chico is the cultural and economic center of the northern Sacramento Valley, as well as the most populous city in California north of the capital city of Sacramento. The city is known as a college town, as the home of California State University, Chico, and for Bidwell Park, one of the largest urban parks in the world.

==History==


The first known inhabitants of the area now known as Chico—a Spanish word meaning &quot;little&quot; — were the Mechoopda Maidu Native Americans. Within the boundaries of modern day Chico, there existed a Maidu village, whose name was recorded as Bah-hahp&#x27;-ke, meaning &quot;straight tree&quot;.

The City of Chico was founded in 1860 by John Bidwell, a member of one of the first wagon trains to reach California in 1843. During the American Civil War, Camp Bidwell (named for John Bidwell, by then a brigadier general of the California Militia), was established a mile outside Chico, by Lt. Col. A. E. Hooker with a company of cavalry and two of infantry, on August 26, 1863.

By early 1865, it was being referred to as Camp Chico when a post called Camp Bidwell was established in northeast California, later to be Fort Bidwell. The city became incorporated January 8, 1872.

Chico was home to a significant Chinese American community when it was first incorporated, but arsonists burned Chico&#x27;s Chinatown in February 1886, driving Chinese Americans out of town.

Historian W.H. &quot;Old Hutch&quot; Hutchinson identified five events as the most seminal in Chico history. They included the arrival of John Bidwell in 1850, the arrival of the California and Oregon Railroad in 1870, the establishment in 1887 of the Northern Branch of the State Normal School, which later became California State University, Chico (Chico State), the purchase of the Sierra Lumber Company by the Diamond Match Company in 1900, and the development of the Army Air Base, which is now the Chico Municipal Airport.

Other events include the construction and relocation of Route 99E through town in the early 1960s, the founding of Sierra Nevada Brewing Company in 1979—what would become one of the top breweries in the nation—and the establishment of a &quot;Green Line&quot; on the western city limits as protection of agricultural lands.

==Geography==

Chico is at the Sacramento Valley&#x27;s northeast edge, one of the richest agricultural areas in the world. The Sierra Nevada mountains lie to the east and south, with Chico&#x27;s city limits venturing several miles into the foothills. To the west, the Sacramento River lies from the city.

Chico sits on the Sacramento Valley floor close to the foothills of the Cascade Range to the north and the Sierra Nevada range to the east and south. Big Chico Creek is the demarcation line between the ranges. The city&#x27;s terrain is generally flat, with increasingly hilly terrain beginning at the eastern city limits.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and 0.04% is water.

The city is bisected by Bidwell Park, which runs from the flat city center deep into the foothills.

The city is also traversed by two creeks and a flood channel, which feeds the Sacramento River. They are named Big Chico Creek, Little Chico Creek, and Lindo Channel (also known as Sandy Gulch, locally).

The city has been designated a Tree City USA for 31 years by the National Arbor Day Foundation.

Construction on this mall began in 1965, and it was the county&#x27;s largest shopping center until the Chico Mall was completed in 1988. For a few years, the &quot;old&quot; mall and the &quot;new&quot; mall competed against one another. The North Valley Plaza Mall was dealt a blow when JCPenney, one of the old mall&#x27;s anchors, moved to the Chico Mall in 1993. The &quot;old&quot; mall slowly declined with increasing vacancies. After several failed attempts at revitalization, the North Valley Plaza Mall was overhauled in 2002, with the center of the mall demolished.

Sierra Nevada Brewing Company, the largest craft brewer in the U.S., is based in Chico.

===Agriculture===

Almonds are the number one crop in Chico and the surrounding area, only recently edging out rice. Other crops in the area include walnuts, kiwis, olives, peaches, and plums.

The city is bounded on the west by orchards with thousands of almond trees, and there are still a few pockets of orchards remaining within the contiguous city limits. The trees bloom with a pink/white flower in late February or early March. Millions of bees are brought in for pollination.

Walnuts are also major agricultural products in the area north and west of town. Unlike the almond crops of the area, walnuts do not have the same appeal as they do not bloom in the spring. However, the trees themselves grow much larger, live longer, and are far more resilient to harsh weather than almond trees, which are known to be sensitive to frost and can be felled easily in winter storms. In the area, walnuts are harvested following the almond harvest season, beginning in mid to late September and stretching well into October. The walnut variety Chico is named after the city.

===Top employers===

The Chico Outlaws were founded with the Golden Baseball League in 2005, where they also won the championship in 2007 and 2010. Starting in the summer of 2016, the Chico Heat returned as a part of the Great West League, a collegiate summer wood-bat league, until 2018 when the league folded due to financial issues from several other participating teams.

Chico has also gained a reputation as being a bicycle-friendly city. In 1997, Chico was ranked as the number one cycling city in the nation by &quot;Bicycle Magazine&quot; and also hosts the Wildflower Century, an annual bike ride throughout Butte County every April, put on by Chico Velo Cycling Club. The city is in the process of creating a network of bicycle paths, trails, and lanes.

==Education==

The Chico Unified School District serves all of the greater Chico area, including areas not within the city limits. Public high schools include Chico High School, Pleasant Valley High School and Inspire School of Arts and Sciences.

In 1998, city voters approved a bond to build a third comprehensive high school that was to be called Canyon View High School. However, after a long search for a suitable site, the school district opted not to build the new high school, a decision based largely on declining enrollment figures. The money from the bond has now been used to improve the Chico and Pleasant Valley high schools.

Commercial passenger flights were discontinued by SkyWest on December 2, 2014, due to nonviability, as indicated by United Airlines in June 2014. The city administration is trying to restore air service, which would be provided by alternate airlines. On July 31, 1961, the first-ever aircraft hijacking on United States soil occurred at the Chico Regional Airport. Two men were critically wounded, and the hijacker was sentenced to more than 30 years in prison.

<text>Concow (Maidu: &quot;Koyoom Kʼawi&quot;, meaning &quot;Meadow&quot;) is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in the Sierra Nevada foothills covering eastern Butte County, California. Due to a decline in employment and repeated wildfires, over the past hundred years the population declined from several thousand to several dozen. On November 8, 2018, a wildfire, the Camp Fire, destroyed most of Concow, as well as the adjacent municipality of Paradise.

Concow is named after the Native American tribe that is indigenous to the area, the Concow Maidu. The original inhabitants ate salmon from the Feather River, acorns and pine nuts, venison, nō-kōm-hē-i&#x27;-nē, and other sources of food which abounded in the California foothills.

==History==
&quot;In the beginning Wahno-no-pem, the Great Spirit, made all things. Before he came, everything on the earth and in the skies was hidden in darkness and in gloom, but where he appeared he was the light. From his essence, out of his breath, he made the sun, the moon, and the countless stars, and pinned them in the blue vault of the heavens.&quot;

===Colonization===
There is no indication that there was external governance of the Concow region or the tribal peoples that inhabited the region during the 1697–1821 Spanish colonization or the 1821–1846 Mexican era, characterized by the spread of California slave ranchos. The Concow region is 20 miles (30 km) north of the city of Oroville (an Anglo-Hispanic compound meaning &#x27;gold-town&#x27;) and about the same distance east of the town of Chico; named for Rancho Arroyo Chico—meaning &#x27;little creek ranch.&#x27; Rancho Arroyo Chico was established through a land-grant from the Mexican authorities in 1844, two years before California was invaded by United States forces, an indication that there was some Mexican governance near the Concow region, but no indication of governance of the region.

===Discovery===
Aside from governance, starting in 1828, northern trappers including Jedediah Smith, Michel Laframboise, and John Work first made contact with the Concow region Maidu. In 1851 the Beckwourth Trail established the first transportation route to the Concow region. The route did not pass directly through the present day Concow, the trail followed a series of ridgetops 10 miles to the East.

Soon began death from diseases, such as pneumonia and malaria, from which the Maidu have no natural immunity.

=== Bounty and extermination ===

The towns of Marysville and Honey Lake paid bounties for Indian scalps. Shasta City authorities offered $5 for every Indian head brought to them.

In 1854, Secretary of War Jefferson Davis wrote California that their &#x27;war&#x27; expenditures could not be authorized without the original bills of sale to verify the purpose was one intended by congress. California was reimbursed $924,259.65 ($23.4M 2010US) by the United States Federal Government and again reimbursed $229,981.67 in 1861 for the intervening years.

===Settlement===
Permanent settlements soon followed and by 1856 several were well established. The growth of these settlements increased after Charles Curtis constructed a toll bridge (1858) across the Feather River at Nelson&#x27;s Bar and the next year (1859) an additional bridge was constructed by residents of Whiskey Town over the Feather River just north of the Concow region. Basically, there was a Northernly trail and bridge from present day Oroville, and a Southernly trail and bridge from present day Magalia.

===Removal of remaining Maidu===
After a decade of genocide and forcible removals, in 1859 the last of the Kon Kow peoples were forcibly removed by Tehama County ranchers as part of a larger four county &#x27;roundup&#x27;. They were held at the Mendocino Reservation until the California Reservation Administration at the camp collapsed due to lack of funding due to the Civil War occurring on the East Coast. The Kon Kow were then deported to the Nome Cult Farms at the Round Valley reservation.

By 1862, the last of the native Concow inhabitants were starving on the cramped Round Valley with unrelated people relocated from surrounding regions. The damp coastal climate on the reservation contrasts with the dry climate of the California &quot;Gold Country&quot; they are accustomed to. It was the midst of the North American Civil War, and federal funds for California Reservations were no longer arriving.

=== Some Maidu leave the reservation ===
In the cooling weather of late September, on September 24, 1862, a combination of the poor camp conditions, forced participation in a massacre of the local Wailaki peoples, warnings by local whites that they were planning to massacre the reservation inhabitants that winter, and an imminent winter disaster (under the supervision of indian agent James Short ) motivated a group of over 400 Maidu to leave the camp.

This group consisted of men, women, children, and elderly individuals. They set out with Tome-ya-nem, without provisions, for the 130 mile hike (210 km) back to their home in the Concow Valley. It was a 10-day hike for well equipped healthy young adults. They made it as far as present day Chico, where Agent Hanson had made an agreement with John Bidwell to stop and encamp the Kon Kow people at Bidwell&#x27;s old river landing (now under Lake Oroville). Under the supervision of Sub Agent Eddy, they were employed for $.10 per hour ($2.72 2013US) constructing the Chico-Humboldt road and providing labor for various employers in the area.

===Massacre===
The following spring three young children were attacked with the two boys killed and the kidnapped girl escaping after being forced to walk to a village near present-day Concow in what became known as the Pence massacre, the murders were within the present day Concow CDP and 9 miles (14.5 km) from Concow Valley - the KonKow people were blamed. These events happened amid documented incidents of local whites dressing as &#x27;indians&#x27; and committing crimes and numerous mule-trains that were attacked and plundered by the various sierra peoples; indigenous, Spanish, and whites. All indications are that the children were kidnapped by a small group of native young men. In the following days 611 KonKow people were murdered by a vigilante volunteer posse of 500 white men that sought to kill every non-white in Butte County. M.H. Wells hid 50 Kon Kows in his Yankee Hill store in the foothills above the camp at Bidwell&#x27;s old river crossing; the vigilante group discovered these people. In a compromise the vigilantes inspected these people and determined four as &#x27;bad people,&#x27; they were tied together in pairs and given a running start before the vigilantes opened fire, the rest were taken to the camp - two of the four were shot and killed. Under a resolution passed at a mass meeting of the public at Pence Ranch on July 27 a group of 12 led by Thomas McDonald of Cherokee and M.H. Wells of Yankee Hill found and convinced the remaining people in the surrounding area to go to the Bidwell camp for their own safety. A group of 26 led by G.G. Marquis of Concow, including Mr. Pence from Messilla Valley, B.P. Hutchinson from Cherokee Flat and John Chapman from Cherokee Ravine, gathered funds to cover the expenses for the Kon Kow people&#x27;s removal. Eventually 461 people including those who returned from Round Valley were gathered at Bidwell&#x27;s Landing. From this group, for the kidnapping and killing of the Lewis children, two were tied to a tree and executed by firing squad. The local US government representative Major George M. Hanson, Superintendent of Indian Affairs, Northern California, and the State Militia representative Captain Augustus W. Starr sent July 31 to assess the situation were unsure what to do with the popular movement or how to stop the acts of vigilante justice. The subsequent commanders of Camp Bidwell during the month of August, Captain Alfred Morton and then Major Ambrose E. Hooker - are absent in early correspondence from Captain Starr asking for guidance with the increasing number of Konkow &#x27;prisoners of war&#x27;.

===The end===
After consulting with Superintendent Hanson and superiors Colonel Richard Cloyd Drum and General George Wright, Captain Starr was ordered by General Wright in Post Order No. 6 to lead 23 soldiers of Company F 2nd Regiment California Volunteer Cavalry and move the now imprisoned people the 110 miles (180 km) from Camp Bidwell back to Round Valley on the Nome Cult Trail on what became a 20-day forced death march now remembered as the KonKow Trail of Tears. Despite efforts by the soldiers and the Pence resolution mandated donations of food and shelter provisions, horses and wagons, each day those who could not make the march through the hot arid early September Sacramento Valley - where afternoon temperatures top 90 °F (32 °C) or over the 6,000 foot (1,800 m) crest of the North Coast Ranges - were left behind without food or water and were soon killed by a pack of wild boar that formed behind and followed the group; the survivors were told to stay at the Round Valley concentration camp or be shot on sight. They were given no provisions by the soldiers and starved to death during the winter.

===Bands of rogue natives===
In 1864 a band of Kon Kow Maidu left the Round Valley reservation and again headed back to their home. The reservation agent sent a letter to the Concow post office noting their departure and that they seemed &#x27;hostile.&#x27; What became of this band is not known, the following year in August a group of 25 Kon Kow were attacked and killed after a robbery that included two murders at the Robert Workman home; this became known as the Three Knolls Massacre and is seen as a smaller episode of the Mill Creek War. And the following year in February, another 5 Kon Kow were killed as continued retribution for the previous years murders.

===Relics of Maidu===
The current inhabitants of Concow, including a few Maidus, commonly find relics of the Maidu in the form of beads and stone tools while digging in and around their homes. There is no monument, plaque, or other recognition in Concow Valley to memorialize the fate of the KonKow people. Few if any of the current inhabitants are aware of the history.

===Commune era===
While a post office operated at Concow from 1882 to 1906, renamed from Con Cow to Concow in 1895, and relocated several times, the region was sparsely populated and dominated by a few ranching families. The economy of the region rose and fell with the gold rush need for supplies, the civil war demand for pine turpentine, logging, and the water way that allowed for ranching. The economy ebbed and flowed for a hundred years under the constraint of the difficult access to the region.

In 1962 a new four-lane alignment of California State Route 70 wrapped around the western side of the then proposed Lake Oroville and reconnected with the existing highway 70 at Jarbo Gap.

===Wildfires===
Beginning in 2000, a series of progressively larger fires burned through Concow.

==== 2000 fire ====
A fire burned on September 19–20, 2000. The fire destroyed 14 structures. The first and smallest Concow fire of the 2000s, this fire was a 2,000 acre fire. At the time, it was considered a large fire.

==== 2008 fire ====
In June 2008, as part of the Butte Lightning Complex Fires, a 60,000 acre (large fire) wildfire destroyed 250 structures. Of those structures, 220 were unpermitted and either were not built to building codes, did not bother with building inspections, or did not use approved building materials. Because of the back-to-the-land nature of the community, affording construction following building codes was not possible initially and reconstruction to building codes is not possible or within the ethos of the community. The county offered special waivers for reconstruction, but the community was already gutted. Those who remain are a shadow of the original community.

==== 2012 fire ====
On September 26, 2012, at 3:10 PM, a wildfire burned 60 acres on Concow Rd at Jordan Hill Rd. CAL FIRE, El Medio Fire, Oroville Fire, USFS, and Butte Co. Fire Volunteers extinguished the fire. 120 total personnel were called to tend to the fire.

==== 2018 fire ====

On November 8, 2018, a fire was reported at 6:33 a.m. PST, close to Camp Creek Road near Pulga. Shortly after the fire erupted, the Butte County Sheriff&#x27;s Office ordered evacuations of surrounding communities and switched to life saving operations. On the first day, much of the town of Paradise and community of Concow were destroyed. As of December 13, Butte County Sheriff&#x27;s Department reported that at least 6 people died in Concow during the Camp Fire. A fallen tree blocked the primary evacuation route from the town and some residents survived by jumping into the creek.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (1.4%) is water.

For unknown reasons the community&#x27;s name was absent from the US Geological Survey files until 1990. Other nearby communities are The Pines (USGS feature ID 268203), and Deadwood (USGS feature ID 1655957).

The community is located off State Route 70 north of Cherokee. The infrastructure is minimal. There is Concow Elementary School, Concow Dam and Reservoir, and the primary paved access route - Concow Road.

== Demographics ==
The first census of the Concow region was in 1990. At first contact with native peoples in Concow the population was over 1,000, however, it was noted that the population had been higher and the people were sick with cholera. The 1850 and 1860 populations are largely the Concow people which declined due to massacre and deportation.

=== 2000 ===
The 2000 census counted 1,095 people in 571 housing units and forming 319 families. The population density was 29 people per square mile (11.2/km), and a housing density of 15 per square mile (5.9/km). Of households, 24 percent included children under the age of 18; half were married couples, 8 percent had a female head of household, and 30 percent were non-families; 23 percent were individuals, and of those a third were over 65 years old. The median family income was $41,250, and the per capita income was $15,829. That placed 27 percent of those under age 18 and 14 percent of the population below the poverty line. The racial makeup was 91 percent White. As individuals, there were, 10 African Americans, 25 Native Americans, and 52 Latinos.

=== 2010 ===
In 2008, the Butte Lightning Complex fire destroyed 308 homes which was 54 percent of the housing. In the 2010 census, &quot;the biggest [regional] percentage drop was in fire-scarred Concow, down 35 percent to a population of 710.&quot;

The 2010 census, counted 710 people in 360 households, forming 178 family units. The population density was , and the housing density was . Of housing units, 30 percent included children under the age of 18. Of family units; 59 percent included children under 18 years old; 82 percent were husband-wife unions. The racial makeup was 85 percent White, as individuals there were 28 Native Americans, and 57 Latinos.

=== 2020 ===
In 2018, the Camp Fire destroyed nearly all of Concow.

The 2020 Census counted 402 people in 305 households: a 43% drop. The racial makeup was 78 percent white.

==Economy==

===Historically===
Historically the Concow region supported hunter-gatherer societies, turpentine extraction, dairy farming, ranching, forestry, water supply, and in the areas outside the granite sands - Quartz reef mining and related industries. The region is zoned (2010 map) for timber production, 5 to 10ac foothill residential, a small area for 1ac foothill residential, and a couple small areas for commercial.

===Informal market===
In the 1980s and 1990s, the CDP became known regionally for a significant domestic product consisting of informal market production and commerce.

Most of the informal market production consists of marijuana agricultural production. Large irrigated plantations were discovered during the 2008 fire.

The 2000 domestic product from legitimate income sources is approximately $17.5 million. During and after the 2008 fires, an estimated $50 million worth of marijuana was removed, indicating that the region&#x27;s per-capita income is under-reported. The region&#x27;s marijuana production is 1/3 of 1% of California&#x27;s $14 billion (2013) dollar total production. At the 2010 population of 710, that is a per capita income of $70,000 per person. The 2008 fire burned most of the protective, shaded forest overstory, converting the vegetation to mostly exposed, sunny and hot chaparral. This changed the microclimate growing conditions, resulting in a drop in crop yields.

===Change in economy===
With the destruction of most unpermitted structures and forest during the 2008 fire, the pattern of residences, commercial land use, informal and formal market industries, and recreational use has changed. There has not been any large-scale residential development in the Concow region. The baby boomer &#x27;bulge&#x27; was expected to result in a steady stream of retirees into the region. To date, however, the population has declined despite the retirees.

==Education==
The Concow Elementary School is located in the community.

<text>Durham is a census-designated place (CDP) in Butte County, California, United States. The population was 5,518 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the CDP has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (0.19%) is water. Durham&#x27;s main agricultural products are almonds and walnuts.

===Climate===
According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Durham has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csa&quot; on climate maps.

==History==
Durham was built on the site of a former Maidu settlement known as Eskini (also, Erskins and Es-kin).
Durham was an experimental cooperative agricultural colony established under the 1917 California State and Settlement Act (AICP Exam Prep 3.0, 2014).

Durham was founded by the Durham Family. It is named for W. W. Durham, member of the California State Assembly. The Durham House is a reminder of what Durham was back in its early years. Durham was a town in which a railroad ran through and still does today. The railroad is what developed this town and kept it alive. The Durham Flour Mill, which burned down several times, was an integral part of this community.

On June 1, 2011, a tornado rated EF1, struck south of Durham, uprooting thousands of almond trees, destroying an out building and damaging a barn.

<text>Gridley is a city in Butte County, California, United States, south of Chico, California, and north of Sacramento, California. The population as of April 1, 2020, is 7,421. California State Route 99 runs through Gridley and Interstate 5 and California State Route 70 are both nearby.

==History==
Butte County was historically a bountiful area covered with oak trees, fields of manzanita brush, and marshes and lakes in the rainy season. The valley floor abounded with wild game, geese and ducks overhead, deer, antelope, tule elk, the coyote, and many smaller varieties of animal life. Fish swarmed in the rivers and creeks. Several tribal groups, including the Maidu people, were settled in the region when they were first encountered by Spanish and Mexican scouting expeditions in the early 18th century. In the 1850s George W. Gridley, a wool grower and grain farmer who at the time was one of the largest landowners in Butte County, settled a home ranch west of the town site that was to be named after him. Gridley was established in 1870 when the Oregon and California Railroad was constructed north from Marysville. The railroad reached Chico on July 2, 1870.

In response to a &quot;The Place Where Crops Never Fail&quot; advertising campaign by the California Irrigated Land Company, members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints began emigrating from the Rexburg, Idaho area to Gridley in November 1906. By February of the following year the Gridley Branch of the church was organized and more Latter-day Saints continued coming to Gridley from Idaho, Nevada, Utah and other states, effectively turning this small farming community into a Mormon enclave. By the end of 1908 there were some 500 LDS settlers in the Gridley area and their first chapel was constructed on the west corner of Sycamore and Vermont Streets in 1912 with a seating capacity of 1,000—the largest LDS meetinghouse west of Salt Lake City at that time.

Following a fire in November 2018 in Paradise, California, 400 temporary modular housing units called the &quot;Gridley Camp Fire Community&quot; were erected at a city-owned industrial park in Gridley.

In 2020, Gridley was the place where former NASA engineer and YouTube star Mark Rober achieved a world record of the World&#x27;s Largest Elephant&#x27;s Toothpaste Explosion with a height of , before subsequently breaking the record again with a height of in 2021.
