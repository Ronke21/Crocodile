<text>Malad City (also commonly known as Malad) is the only city and the county seat of Oneida County, Idaho, United States. In 2020 the population was 2,299 people.

The city is named after the nearby Malad River, the name being French for &quot;sickly&quot;. Malad City is located along Interstate 15 on the east side of the Malad Valley from the Utah/Idaho border.

==History==

Established in 1864, Malad is one of the oldest communities in the state of Idaho. The community received its name from Donald Mackenzie, a Scottish-Canadian trapper, who passed through the valley between 1818 and 1821 with a party of trappers. Some of his men became sick while camped here and, believing that the illness was caused by drinking water from the valley&#x27;s principal stream, he named it &quot;Malade&quot; meaning sick or bad in the French language. Actually, the water had nothing to do with the men&#x27;s illness, as it was later learned by the second party led by Jim Bridger between 1832 and 1835. The men had most likely eaten some beaver that fed on the poisonous roots of water hemlock trees that put a naturally occurring cicutoxin into the animals&#x27; flesh. The beaver would have likely been immune to the poison because of long-term adaptation, but the trappers suffered from their feast. Native tribes avoided this outcome by altering food preparation methods to include boiling, which apparently deactivated the poison.

Malad began largely as a Welsh LDS settlement, whose settlers brought their Welsh traditions with them. In addition to the LDS majority, some of the leading families in the community belonged to the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. These two denominations each built a place of worship in the town. Some of the minutes from early town meetings were taken down in both English and Welsh. The city is very proud of its Welsh heritage. Malad lays claim to having more people of Welsh descent per capita than anywhere outside Wales. Malad celebrated its Welsh heritage by holding an annual “eisteddfod”, patterned after the music and poetry contests held in Wales for over 900 years. The eisteddfod was an all-day event with people coming from all over southeastern Idaho. The event featured music, songs and storytelling of Wales. The custom continued until 1916 and the American entry into World War I. With the goal of renewing the old eisteddfod tradition in Malad, in 2004, the annual Malad Valley Welsh Festival was established.

In the summer of 1843 John C. Fremont and his party of 39 men passed the spot where Malad City now stands.

LDS prophet Brigham Young came through the Malad Valley in 1855. In 1856, at his request, Utahn members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints migrated to the region. This party of 15 families led by Ezra Barnard traveled to the Malad Valley and established a community by the name of Fort Stuart. The following year in 1857, Fort Stuart was renamed Malad City. A U.S. post office was established in 1865.

By 1886 Malad City was the fastest growing village in eastern Idaho. The city was an important commercial center between Salt Lake and Butte, Montana. In 1906, the railroad reached Malad City, allowing travel to Salt Lake City in only a four-hour ride by rail. The population of the city would double over the next 15 years as a result.

On June 19, 1910, Malad experienced a flood when the earthen Deep Creek Dam, northeast of the city, broke.

On March 27, 1975, a magnitude 6.1 earthquake shook the Pocatello Valley near the Idaho-Utah border. The epicenter was only southwest of Malad City which was hit hardest by the quake. Nearly two-thirds of its homes and businesses had some sort of damage.

A corporate jet carrying eight people including four Coca-Cola executives crashed on January 15, 1996, killing all on board. The large twin-engine turbo-prop was flying from Salt Lake City, Utah to Pocatello, Idaho for a Coca-Cola sales meeting. The Mitsubishi MU-2 aircraft crashed and burned at the base of a canyon northwest of Malad. According to the National Transportation Safety Board in its published report, the cause of the accident was listed as ice on the wings.

Towards the end of 2003, a nationwide influenza outbreak occurred. Malad was, appropriately, likely the hardest hit community in the nation. So many people became ill during the first part of December, 2003 that the city was virtually shut down. The entire school district in Malad was closed for three days in an effort to keep students from spreading the ailment. Roughly a third of the students became ill. Church services and Christmas festivities were also cancelled.

Malad City once had the oldest department store in the state of Idaho. Evans Co-op opened in 1865 as part of a Latter-day Saint movement in which local production and purchasing was encouraged through cooperatives. Though Evans is no more, the historic building remains. The city has undertaken efforts to renovate the building after the hardware store went out of business. Renovation is still underway. Malad City also has the longest running weekly newspaper in Idaho, called The Idaho Enterprise which published its first issue on June 6, 1879.

Because of its proximity to Utah, which has no state lottery, Malad has become a major retail site for the Idaho Lottery.
The Top Stop Gasoline and Convenience store in Malad is responsible for 3 percent of Idaho&#x27;s lottery sales, and the town as a whole accounts for over 19 percent of state sales. Only Boise, the state&#x27;s largest city, has higher lotto sales. Over the 22-year history of the Idaho Lottery, it is estimated that Utahns have provided $54.1 million in lottery profits, which Idaho then uses for its own capital works and school funding.

==Geography==

The Wasatch fault runs along the east side of Malad Valley, and there are several active faults in the area to the south and west.

<doc id="110762" wikidata="Q1517585" url="?curid=110762" title="New Plymouth, Idaho">
<text>New Plymouth is a city in Payette County, Idaho. The population was 1,538 at the 2010 census, up from 1400 in 2000. It was incorporated on February 15, 1896. It is the host of the annual Payette County Fair and rodeo.

New Plymouth is part of the Ontario, OR–ID Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
New Plymouth was a colony town, bought and planned before it was settled. It was the combined project of a group of people purportedly dissatisfied with city life in Chicago, who in 1895 formed what they called &quot;The Plymouth Society of Chicago&quot; and William E. Smythe, who was the chairman of the executive committee of the National Irrigation Congress and a famous irrigation promoter. Mr. Smythe was determined to found a colony to serve as a striking argument in favor of his project - irrigation. He spoke throughout the east, urging young and old men to go west in colonies and develop the country with the help of irrigation. He wanted the first colony to be called New Plymouth — after Plymouth, Massachusetts — and wanted it located in southwestern Idaho in the Payette Valley, which he had found apt for his purpose because of the extraordinary water supply via the nearby Payette River.

The Plymouth Society of Chicago selected a committee to investigate the irrigated Payette River Valley in the five-year-old state of Idaho, and another site in Colorado, to be purchased for the colony. The present city of New Plymouth was on the drawing boards in Chicago, designed as a town able to be self-reliant through the use of irrigation, solidly built on an agricultural and railroad economy.

In February 1896, each colonist purchased 20 shares of stock at $30 per share, which entitled him to of land and a town lot. He was to clear the land of sagebrush and plant fruit trees, preferably apples. The town was platted with a horseshoe shape with its open end facing to the north, toward the railroad and the river. This area was planned as an industrial zone, and the acre tracts around the horseshoe were the residential lots.

The homes were to be built on the street side and the balance of the acre for garden and pasture for the family cow and the driving team. Two streets, separated by an park, curve around the town in a horseshoe shape. This mile-long (1.6 km) park and the streets that enclose it were called &quot;The Boulevard.&quot; The park was planted with grass and shade trees. Plymouth Avenue, the main street and principal business thoroughfare, was surveyed (16 feet off the section line) down the center of the horseshoe from the railroad on the north through the Boulevard on the south.

The community was at first called the New Plymouth Farm Village and was governed by a colony board of directors until it incorporated as a village in 1908, dropping the last two words in the name.

==Boulevard==
The Boulevard is the main residential area and the original setting of the town. There are many unique things about the boulevard. First, it is in the shape of a horseshoe with a large park down the middle. Also, a system of ditches parallel the roads and drain into the canal, giving each landowner who pays for a share access to irrigation water. This comes from the days when farming was intended to be done inside the city. It is now used for gardening or watering the lawn. It also now includes a frisbee golf course along the west side.

<text>Payette is a city in and the county seat of Payette County, Idaho, United States. The population was 7,433 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Ontario, OR−ID Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The settlement was originally named &quot;Boomerang,&quot; a construction camp for the Oregon Short Line from 1882 to 1884 at the mouth of the Payette River. Logs were floated down the river to the sawmills at the camp to produce railroad ties. After completion of the railroad, the settlement moved upstream to its present site and incorporated in 1891 as &quot;Payette,&quot; to honor François Payette, a French-Canadian fur trapper and one of the first white men to explore the area. He arrived in present-day Idaho from Astoria and was later the head of the Fort Boise trading post for the British Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company from 1835 to 1844. A large merry man, Payette was highly regarded for his helpful assistance to the many travelers who came through the fort. Following his retirement in 1844, he returned to Montreal, after which the rest of his life is a mystery.

Payette County was created in 1917, partitioned from Canyon County, and the city of Payette became the county seat.

==History==
Rockland claims its founding in 1879, 11 years before Idaho achieved its statehood in 1890. The Rockland Valley was traveled by trappers before its founding, but its first permanent settlers entered the valley in 1878. At that time, Hidalgo Guadelupe Valdez herded his cattle into the valley and chose the valley as his home. In efforts to establish his home he dug a ditch from the East Fork Creek as means to irrigate his 30 acres of land. Thus, he was granted his &quot;Water Right&quot; on Feb. 15, 1879. Not only was he the first settler in the valley, but also the first irrigated farmer in the valley.

<doc id="110767" wikidata="Q990875" url="?curid=110767" title="Kellogg, Idaho">
<text>Kellogg is a city in the Silver Valley of Shoshone County, Idaho, United States, in the Idaho Panhandle region. The city lies near the Coeur d&#x27;Alene National Forest and about 36 miles (58 km) east-southeast of Coeur d&#x27;Alene along Interstate 90. As of the 2010 United States Census, the city had a total population of 2,120, down by a third from its population in 1980.

==History==

Kellogg was incorporated in 1907. The city limits included mine property in 1955, and smelter property in 1956. The population in 1960 was about 6000.

Kellogg is named after a prospector named Noah Kellogg. The city became a center of mining for silver. Nearly a century of mine operations produced an extensive amount of silver. There was also a history of disputes between union miners and mine owners as workers tried to improve their conditions, including wages and safety conditions. With declining yield, the Bunker Hill Mine (&amp; smelter) closed in 1981. Thousands lost their jobs, and the mining operations resulted in regional lead contamination of water and soil. Other mines reduced operations, as well.

Since the mines closed, Kellogg has been developing as a resort town to take advantage of its mountains for skiing and other activities. By 1990 a long track gave access by gondola from the city of Kellogg to an alpine ski lodge at on Kellogg Mountain.

Condos, hotels, restaurants, shops, a water park, and a golf course have been developed in relation to Silver Mountain Resort on Kellogg Mountain. The city of Kellogg was featured in &quot;The New York Times&quot; travel section in 2008 as an up-and-coming resort town.

The Silver Mountain Resort is an alpine ski area which includes Kellogg Peak at and Wardner Peak (). It is accessed by taking the world&#x27;s longest single-cabin gondola.

===Sunshine Mine===
In May 1972, the Sunshine Mine of Kellogg was the site of one of the worst U.S. mining accidents, resulting in a fire that caused the deaths of 91 miners. Eight days after the fire started, two men emerged from the mine. They were found on the 4800 ft (1463 m) level of the mine near a fresh air source. All others trapped in the mine had died.

In the aftermath, the government passed new safety regulations. Every miner in the U.S. now carries a &quot;self-rescuer&quot; (a breathing apparatus made with hopcalite and much simpler than a SCBA), which gives the miner a chance to avoid death due to carbon monoxide poisoning.

Sunshine Mine remained open until February 16, 2001, producing 360 million troy ounces (11,000,000 kg) of silver. Sterling Mining has plans to continue exploration and development of the mine, exercising an option the company purchased in 2003.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.
==Climate==
Kellogg has a mixture of a dry-summer continental climate and a cold mediterranean climate. The area is prone to both heat spikes and cold snaps in spite of fairly moderate averages.

<text>Mullan is a city in the northwest United States, located in the Silver Valley mining district of northern Idaho. The population was 646 at the 2020 census and 692 at the 2010 census, and 840 in 2000.

In Shoshone County at the east end of the Silver Valley, Mullan is in a sheltered canyon of the Coeur d&#x27;Alene Mountains at an elevation of above sea level. The entrance to the Lucky Friday mine is several hundred yards east of the city center; the active mine (silver, lead, &amp; zinc) descends more than below the surface.

Interstate 90 runs by the city&#x27;s south side, and the Montana border at Lookout Pass is east at above sea level.

==History==
Mullan came into existence in 1884 with the discovery of gold at the Gold Hunter Mine, which turned out to be a lead and silver producer. That same year, George Good made a lead-silver strike with the Morning Mine and Mullan came into existence between the two mines. The site was filed in August 1888, after the village had twenty log and fifteen frame houses, a sawmill, and a population of 150. The Northern Pacific Railway arrived in 1889 and the city was incorporated in 1904.

During the Coeur d&#x27;Alene labor confrontation of 1899, two hundred miners from Mullan joined the Dynamite Express. In the aftermath of the labor war, many of Mullan&#x27;s leaders and Populist elected officials including the sheriff were arrested and sent to the Wallace bull pens.

The city was named for West Point graduate John Mullan who was in charge of selecting a wagon route (commonly called the Mullan Road) between Fort Benton (Montana) and Fort Walla Walla (Washington). Lieutenant Mullan, a topographical engineer in the U.S. Army, began gathering information in 1854. Delayed by the Coeur d&#x27;Alene War of 1858, construction began in 1859 from Fort Walla Walla.

From today&#x27;s Mullan townsite, the Mullan Road continued southeast up Willow Creek to cross the border at today&#x27;s St. Regis Pass It was formerly &quot;Sohon Pass,&quot; named by Mullan for artist Gustavus Sohon, whose explorations found the gap, about a mile west of Lookout Pass. After the strenuous project was completed in 1860, floods wiped out substantial stretches of the road, and the road was re-routed in 1861. Floods again damaged the road, and ultimately, no provision for maintenance was provided.

Mullan&#x27;s population has declined in recent decades, from a peak of 2,291 in 1940.

===Present day===
Mullan is significantly smaller than it was in the heyday of the Morning and Lucky Friday mines. The Mullan School District operates the John Mullan Elementary School (K–6) and the Mullan Junior/Senior High School opened in 1927.

Mullan has its own fire department and owns and maintains an Olympic-size swimming pool () for community use. The city is accessed from Interstate 90 at exits 67, 68, and 69.

<text>Smelterville is a city in Shoshone County, Idaho, United States. The population was 627 at the 2010 census.

The town was named in 1929 by a voice vote of its residents; the other choices were Van Rena and Silver City (already used in southwestern Idaho). The presence of the Bunker Hill smelter, which started operating in 1917, caused the name to be selected.

<text>Wallace, Idaho is a city in and the county seat of Shoshone County, Idaho, in the Silver Valley mining district of the Idaho Panhandle. Founded in 1884, Wallace sits alongside the South Fork of the Coeur d&#x27;Alene River (and Interstate 90). The town&#x27;s population was 791 at the 2020 census.

The Trail of the Coeur d&#x27;Alenes rails-to-trail passes through Wallace.

==History==
Gold was discovered in a stream about twelve miles north of the future Wallace in the spring of 1882. Migration to the region increased, especially during the following year. Eagle City, Prichard, Murrayville (now Murray) and other mining camps were founded, and mining claims proliferated. Silver was also discovered.

===Founding and early years===
In the spring of 1884, Colonel William R. Wallace built a cabin at a site he called &quot;Placer Center.&quot; A Civil War veteran, Wallace was heavily involved in mining ventures after the war.
The spot&#x27;s central location in the mining district clearly offered promise as a town site. In fact, a news sheet published at the time extolled the town&#x27;s favorable prospects because &quot;it is on the Mullan Road, which is the main emigrant road on the Bitter Root divide.&quot; Wallace believed in his new venture and invested money to build access roads, put up lot fences and make other improvements. By the spring of 1885, Placer Center had a grocery store and several other small businesses. Within a year or so, there was also a general store, a sawmill, hotel and more.

Wallace and Richard Lockey bought &quot;Sioux half-breed scrip&quot; from a bank in Spokane, Washington to purchase an town site that would become the town of Wallace. Such scrip entitled the holder to &quot;locate&quot; (claim) unoccupied and unsurveyed public lands. Wallace&#x27;s application for a land patent to secure title to the townsite was submitted to the United States General Land Office (GLO) in Coeur d&#x27;Alene on June 5, 1886.

The GLO head office in Washington, D.C. found that his scrip had been reported lost by its original holder. That original scrip had then been replaced and used to claim land, around six years earlier. For this reason, the GLO denied Wallace&#x27;s application, in a letter dated February 3, 1887. Nevertheless, Col. Wallace and his Wallace Townsite Company continued to sell properties (lots) because the Coeur d&#x27;Alene land officer had advised them that they could do so. In fact, the officer said he would act as Wallace&#x27;s attorney if a dispute arose. Neither the Company nor Col. Wallace informed potential or actual buyers that their patent on the townsite was uncertain.

The settlement flourished, and by the fall of 1887 when its first school was opened, there were many saloons, one brewery, a large apartment building with a public hall, a hotel, and many stores and shops. On September 10, 1887, a narrow gauge rail line reached Wallace, leading to further growth. Within two years the railroad would offer regular scheduled service. On May 2, 1888, a group of citizens petitioned Shoshone County&#x27;s county commissioners for the town&#x27;s incorporation, now to be called &quot;Wallace&quot;, after the Colonel. Wallace was appointed one of the five trustees of the new town.

In November 1888, the townsite company engaged a Washington, D.C., attorney who specialized in contested public lands cases. The letter reporting this action does not say what event led to the move. However, it asserted that the original scrip owner had &quot;made oath ... that he had never parted with the original, and never gave anyone power to use his name in any other location.&quot; That is, the company saw the reported GLO duplication of the scrip as a fraudulent action.

But by February 19, 1889, reports had arrived in Wallace of a case involving disputed Sioux half-breed scrip. The Department of Interior (DOI) denied a Montana land claim because the scrip had been used for the benefit of persons other than the mixed-blood it had been issued to initially. This decision more closely followed the apparent intent of the original legislation, but was actually a reversal of long-standing GLO practice. For decades, the GLO had allowed land dealers to buy the scrip from the mixed-bloods for a pittance and then claim large expanses of valuable public land for white use. One group of speculators made substantial profits from at least 15,000 acres (6,070 ha) of land in Minnesota, Nevada and California. Newspaper reports suggested that this DOI decision might affect land claims in several places across the West.

In Wallace, the news of the case led many townspeople—on the night of Tuesday, February 19, 1889—to participate in &quot;lot jumping,&quot; that is, peremptorily marking the space as their own. Newspapers across the United States carried news of the small western town&#x27;s real estate upheaval. &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Many persons heretofore considered rich are no longer so, while poor persons have jumped into comfortable circumstances.&quot; Some existing owners guarded their own lots in order to retain their right of ownership. Local historian Judge Richard Magnuson wrote, &quot;By 2 a.m., everything was located and the rush subsided.&quot;

William R. Wallace reacted to the jumping with an angry letter, partially quoted above to describe what the company considered improper action by the GLO. The letter closed, &quot;The higher courts will ere long decide the validity of the claimants.&quot; With this letter and several others, Wallace took the stance of an aggrieved party in relation to the GLO&#x27;s handling of the Sioux scrip. It has been documented that the under-staffed and poorly-run GLO was indeed involved in corrupt dealings at that time. Continuing their aggressive stance, the Wallace Townsite Company filed 13 legal suits, demanding $1,000 from citizens it claimed had illegally jumped their properties. Several years passed before all the disputes were fully resolved. Fortunately, land holders who had legitimately developed their plots were able to gain clear title. By the time the disputes were concluded, William R. Wallace had opened an office in Spokane to pursue mining ventures in the West.

In July 1890, a fire aided by strong winds destroyed thirteen saloons, six hotels, a bank, a theater, eighteen office structures (many doctors and lawyers, and the newspaper), three livery stables, and over thirty other stores and shops. A meeting hall, the telephone exchange, and the post office were also destroyed. Following the fire, the town organized a new, better-equipped fire company, installed an improved water system, and adopted ordinances requiring fireproof construction in certain downtown areas.

===Labor strife, 1892 and 1899===
In 1892, mine owners in the Coeur d&#x27;Alenes found the usual investor pressure for profits exacerbated by increased railroad freight rates. Their subsequent measures to cut costs sparked a strike by the mine workers, so the operators brought in replacements. The pressure finally sparked the Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Idaho labor strike of 1892, which ended in a union victory. The immediate costs were three men dead on each side and the total destruction of the Frisco ore mill, about four miles northeast of Wallace.

Unfortunately, the violence did not end there. An armed mob attacked the replacement workers as they waited for river transport out to Coeur d&#x27;Alene City. No evidence was found that the union leadership sanctioned this brutality, but reports to Idaho Governor Willey said that a dozen bullet-riddled bodies had been found. Martial law was declared and lasted about four months, but none of the charges brought by authorities were upheld.

A similar, although not nearly so deadly, confrontation occurred in April 1899. It again began among the miners working northeast of Wallace. However, the union&#x27;s target was the Bunker Hill &amp; Sullivan Mining Company, which adamantly refused to recognize or deal with the miners&#x27; union. A huge force took over and blew up the company&#x27;s mill at Wardner. During the Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Idaho labor confrontation of 1899 attackers murdered a non-union miner and killed one of their own by &quot;friendly fire.&quot;

Alarmed by the size of attacking force – perhaps as many as a thousand men – Governor Frank Steunenberg imposed martial law. About a thousand men were rounded up and held in a crude prison, dubbed &quot;the bullpen.&quot; But in the end, only one union man was convicted of a crime, and he was pardoned and released two years later. But, again, there was a tragic aftermath. In 1905, union assassin Harry Orchard murdered ex-Governor Steunenberg.
===Wallace grows===
In 1893, Wallace went from governance by a board of trustees to a city charter. The first official mayor was William S. Haskins, who would shortly thereafter be appointed as Idaho&#x27;s first State Mining Inspector. Haskins was succeeded by Oscar Wallace, son of Colonel Wallace. By that year, Wallace could also boast of the Providence Hospital, &quot;an institution which has no equal of its kind in the state of Idaho, and no superior of its size in the United States.&quot;

In 1898, having experienced explosive growth, the city implemented a campaign to become the county seat for Shoshone County. A similar attempt six years earlier had left Wallace a distant third to Murray. This time around, Wallace garnered about three-quarters of the votes cast.

The year 1900 saw Wallace residents looking forward to even more growth from its population of over two thousand. They were proud of their extensive electric light system, substantial amounts of paved streets and the most building activity the city had ever seen.

However, one third of the town of Wallace was destroyed by the Great Fire of 1910, which burned about in Washington, Idaho, and Montana. Although set back by the devastation, the city soon resumed its growth, aided by strong demand for lead during World War I. After a post-war lull, the industry resumed its growth in the 1920s.

=== Famous for vice ===
A mining community with a &quot;work hard, play hard&quot; attitude, Wallace became well known for a permissive approach toward drinking, gambling and decriminalized prostitution. From 1884 to 1991, illegal yet regulated brothel-based sex work openly flourished because locals believed that sex work prevented rape and bolstered the economy, so long as it was regulated and confined to the northeastern part of town. Throughout the rest of the country, progressive era politics drove red-light districts underground, but madams in Wallace enjoyed unprecedented status as influential businesswomen, community leaders, and philanthropists. Between 1940 and 1960, for example, an average of 30 to 60 women came into town to work in one of the five well-established brothels.

===Pollution versus jobs===
By around 1930, residents downstream from the Coeur d&#x27;Alene mines were complaining about water and air pollution. Operators downplayed the issue, but did make a few process concessions. Then the ravages of the Great Depression virtually eliminated the issue for the duration. That was followed by the ramp-up to World War II, which further kept the problems in the background. After the war, the metals industry in the region boomed, reaching a peak by around 1965. Process improvements continued but could not totally alleviate the effluent problems. And practically nothing was done about a half-century of pollution buildup.

Beginning in 1955, the U. S. Congress passed a series of air pollution laws, culminating in the Clean Air Act of 1970. That was followed two years later by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. That and creation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) put heavy pressure on mining operations, including those in the Coeur d&#x27;Alenes. When the Bunker Hill smelter in Kellogg shut down in 1981, the Silver Valley lost a vast number of jobs, three-quarters of all the regional mining employment by some estimates. Wallace suffered huge cutbacks just like all the other towns in the area. Only the Lucky Friday mine, located about seven miles east of Wallace, near Mullan, remains in operation at this time.

=== Historic preservation ===
Through the period of mine closures, Wallace had troubles of its own. In 1956, the Federal government authorized the Interstate Highway System and construction got under way. Then city leaders in Wallace learned that plans for Interstate 90 in Idaho would virtually wipe out the entire downtown. Their response is outlined in a section below. But the key event occurred in 1979, when several blocks of downtown Wallace were listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district, the Wallace Historic District.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

===Climate===
Wallace has a continental Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Dsb&quot;) with warm summers and cold, snowy winters. Winters are relatively moderate for an inland location so far north, although heavy rainfall often occurs when mild Pacific air penetrates inland, as in January 1974 when of precipitation occurred including on the 16th. July 1973 to June 1974 was also the wettest &quot;rain year&quot;, receiving , whilst the driest rain year from July 2000 to June 2001 saw only . The most snowfall has been in January 1969; July 1968 to June 1969 also saw the maximum annual snowfall at .

When cold air comes from Canada, temperatures can become severe, with the record low being on December 30, 1968. The coldest month since records began in 1941 has been January 1949 with an average of ; the hottest has been July 2007 with a daily mean of and a mean maximum of .

==Arts and culture==
===Museums===
The Wallace District Mining Museum documents and recounts the legacy of over a century of mining history in the region. Mine tours are offered in the Sierra Silver Mine in Wallace and the Crystal Gold Mine in nearby Kellogg.

The Oasis Bordello Museum is dedicated to the history of sex work; housed in a former brothel, curious tourists or nostalgic former patrons can tour the upstairs, which has been preserved as it was when the women left. The former Lux Rooms has been repurposed into a boutique inn, and it also has many elements preserved from its brothel roots, including floor-to-ceiling gold veined mirrors.

The Barnard-Stockbridge Museum, located in the historic Holy Trinity Episcopal Church, displays period memorabilia and photographs maintained by the University of Idaho Barnard-Stockbridge Photograph Collection. The collection consists of large format photographs taken by the studio of Thomas Barnard and Nellie Stockbridge between 1893 and 1965. The collection of photographs is considered the best photographic collection in the Northwest United States and one of the seven best collections in the county.

=== Events ===
Regular annual events in Wallace include the Blues Fest, Statehood Day Parade, Huckleberry Festival 5k Walk/Run, Under the Freeway Flea Market, Gyro Days, Center Of The Universe Re-Dedication, Fall for History, Extreme SkiJor, and Home for the Holidays Christmas Festival.

==Infrastructure==
=== Transportation ===
Wallace is accessible via Interstate 90 and State Highway 4. The nearest airport is Shoshone County Airport (S83), about west, near Smelterville.

In its prime, two railroads served Wallace. The Oregon-Washington Railway &amp; Navigation Co. (Union Pacific) reached Wallace from the west, offering passenger service to Spokane and Portland until about 1958, and freight service to Spokane as late as 1992. The Northern Pacific Railway approached Wallace from the east with its branch over Lookout Pass to the NP mainline at St. Regis, Montana. The former NP depot was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.
To avoid demolition during freeway construction, it was moved south a decade later in 1986. Now at Sixth and Pine streets, it currently functions as a local railroad museum.

The former NP line was abandoned and removed between St. Regis and Mullan in 1980. Union Pacific continued operating the Wallace-Mullan segment of the NP line until abandoning the entire Plummer-Mullan route in 1992. After abandonment, this segment of former UP and NP lines was developed into a rail trail, the Trail of the Coeur d&#x27;Alenes, which runs from east of Mullan through Wallace, to the Washington-Idaho state line west of Plummer.

Several miles to the south, the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, commonly called the Milwaukee Road, ran transcontinental passenger trains on its Pacific Extension between Chicago and Seattle from 1911 to 1961, with freight trains until 1980. After the Milwaukee Road discontinued and abandoned the route, much of it also became a rail trail, the &quot;Route of the Hiawatha Trail&quot;. Currently, it runs from Taft, Montana (near the top of Lookout Pass), descending west to Avery. This trail is at least distant at its closest point, but as the nearest large community, Wallace advertises itself as the primary jumping off point for trail users.

==== Interstate 90 ====
Interstate 90 passes through Wallace on an elevated freeway viaduct, completed in 1991. Until then, I-90 traffic used a surface highway previously designated U.S. Route 10 and used the main city streets through downtown. Wallace had the last traffic light on a coast-to-coast a fact that is displayed on signage in downtown Wallace proclaiming it to be &quot;The Last Stoplight.&quot; In September 1991, the Idaho Department of Transportation moved I-90 to a freeway viaduct above the north side of town. Prior to this, the interstate turned into arterial streets on the western outskirts of town and followed the main road through town before becoming a highway again on Wallace&#x27;s east side. The section of US-10 through Wallace is now designated Interstate 90 Business.

The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) originally planned to build I-90 as an at-grade freeway. This plan would have demolished most of downtown Wallace. In the 1970s, city leaders listed every building in the downtown on the National Register of Historic Places. The FHWA had to redesign I-90 to bypass downtown because federal law protects historic places from negative effects of highway construction. An elevated viaduct was erected.

==In popular culture==
The 1997 film &quot;Dante&#x27;s Peak&quot; was shot on location in Wallace, which was portrayed as the fictional town &quot;Dante&#x27;s Peak&quot; in Washington state, with a large hill just southeast of the town digitally altered to look like a volcano.

On September 25, 2004, Mayor Ron Garitone proclaimed Wallace to be the center of the Universe in a tongue-in-cheek political statement aimed at the EPA. Specifically, a sewer access cover was declared to be the precise location of the &quot;Center of the Universe.&quot; This declaration was a humorous jab at the EPA&#x27;s reliance on &quot;probabilism,&quot; a theory the agency employed when declaring Wallace a Superfund site. During their assessment, the EPA announced that local water and soil were contaminated, potentially due to mining activities. However, they admitted they could not definitively prove whether the lead contamination was from ongoing mining operations or naturally occurring. Using probabilistic reasoning, they expanded the Superfund site from 21 square miles to 1,500 square miles, significantly devaluing local properties and businesses. The EPA&#x27;s assessment controversially treated lead sulfide, a less harmful and less bioavailable form of lead, as equivalent to pure lead, further fueling local criticism of the Superfund designation. For example, lead sulfide bioavailability in some animal studies is estimated to be 50 to 100 times lower than that of soluble lead salts.

In response, the Center of the Universe manhole cover was designed and installed to symbolize Wallace&#x27;s resilience and mining heritage. It bears the inscription &quot;Center of the Universe. Wallace, Idaho&quot; and includes four sets of initials—HL, CDE, SRLM, and BHM—representing four major mining companies that shaped the region: Hecla Mining, Coeur d’Alene Precious Metals, Sunshine Silver Mine, and Bunker Hill Mining Company. This act of defiance also paid homage to Wallace&#x27;s mining legacy, which dates back to 1884 and has yielded over 1.2 billion ounces of silver, earning the town the title &quot;Silver Capital of the World.&quot;

This whimsical declaration also inspired British comedian and writer Danny Wallace to visit Wallace, leading to his book &quot;Danny Wallace and the Centre of the Universe&quot;, published in 2006. The event continues to be celebrated annually on the third Saturday of September.

<doc id="110773" wikidata="Q1511397" url="?curid=110773" title="Wardner, Idaho">
<text>Wardner is a city in Shoshone County, Idaho, United States. Located in the Silver Valley mining region, the population was 188 at the 2010 census, down from 215 in 2000.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

==History==
The city was named for Joe or Jim Wardner, an early promoter of the Bunker Hill and Sullivan mine in the 1880s and a seller of corner lots in the city. Born in Wisconsin in 1846, he held various occupations in Arizona, California, Utah, Wisconsin, South Dakota, and Washington state. After his time in the Silver Valley of Idaho, he followed the mining booms to South Africa, British Columbia, and the Klondike; he published his autobiography in 1900 and died in El Paso, Texas in 1905.

In 1892, and again in 1899, angry union miners converged on the Bunker Hill mine during confrontations with mine owners.

Hard rock miners in Shoshone County protested wage cuts with a strike in 1892. After several lost their lives in a shooting war provoked by discovery of a company spy, the U.S. army forced an end to the strike. Hostilities erupted once again in 1899 when, in response to the company firing seventeen men for joining the union, the miners dynamited the Bunker Hill &amp; Sullivan mill. Again, lives were lost, and the army intervened.

The gondola for the Silver Mountain ski resort passes over the town.

<text>Twin Falls is the county seat and largest city of Twin Falls County, Idaho, United States. The city had a population of 51,807 as of the 2020 census. In the Magic Valley region, Twin Falls is the largest city in a radius, and is the regional commercial center for south-central Idaho and northeastern It is the principal city of the Twin Falls metropolitan statistical area, which officially includes the entirety of Twin Falls and Jerome The border town resort community of Jackpot, Nevada, south at the state line, is unofficially considered part of the greater Twin Falls area.

Located on a broad plain at the south rim of the Snake River Canyon, Twin Falls is where daredevil Evel Knievel attempted to jump across the canyon in 1974 on a steam-powered rocket. The jump site is northeast of central Twin Falls, midway between Shoshone Falls and the Perrine Bridge.

==History==
Excavations at Wilson Butte Cave near Twin Falls in 1959 revealed evidence of human activity, including arrowheads, that rank among the oldest dated artifacts in North America. Later Native American tribes predominant in the area included the Northern Shoshone and Bannock.

The first people of European ancestry to visit the Twin Falls area are believed to be members of a group led by American Wilson Price Hunt, who attempted to blaze an all-water trail westward from St. Louis, Missouri, to Astoria, Oregon, in 1811 and 1812. Hunt&#x27;s expedition met with disaster; much of his expedition was destroyed and one man was killed in rapids on the Snake River known as Caldron Linn near present-day Murtaugh. Hunt and the surviving members of his expedition completed the journey to Astoria by land.

In 1812 and 1813, Robert Stuart successfully led an overland expedition eastward from Astoria to St. Louis, which passed through the Twin Falls area. Stuart&#x27;s route formed the basis of what became the Oregon Trail. Some 150 years later, Robert Stuart Middle School in Twin Falls was named in his honor.

The first permanent settlement in the area was a stage stop established in 1864 at Rock Creek near the present-day townsite. By 1890, a handful of successful agricultural operations were in the Snake River Canyon, but the lack of infrastructure and the canyon&#x27;s geography made irrigating the dry surrounding area improbable at best.

To address this issue in 1900, I. B. Perrine founded the Twin Falls Land and Water Company, largely to build an irrigation canal system for the area. After an August 1900 area survey of in October 1900, the company was granted the necessary water rights to begin construction of the irrigation system. Several lots in the surveyed area were set aside specifically for future townsites. These lots eventually became the settlements of Twin Falls, Kimberly, Buhl, Filer, Hansen, and Murtaugh. In 1902, the project nearly failed, as most of the original investors pulled out, with only Salt Lake City businessman Stanley Milner maintaining a stake in the company.

By 1903, Perrine, who had been a successful farmer and rancher in the Snake River Canyon, had obtained private financing from Milner and others under the provisions of the Carey Act of 1894 to build a dam on the Snake River near Caldron Linn. Completed in 1905, Milner Dam and its accompanying canals made commercial irrigation outside the Snake River Canyon practical for the first time. As a result, Perrine is generally credited as the founder of Twin Falls.

A land drawing was held for the future townsite in July 1903, with disappointing results. A much more successful drawing was held in October 1904. Twin Falls city was founded in 1904 as a planned community, designed by celebrated Franco-American architect Emmanuel Louis Masqueray, with proceeds from sales of townsite lots going toward construction of irrigation canals. Twin Falls was incorporated as a village on April 12, 1905. The city is named for a nearby waterfall on the Snake River of the same name. In 1907, Twin Falls became the seat of the newly formed Twin Falls County.

After Milner Dam was constructed, agricultural production in south-central Idaho increased substantially. In 1909, the privately owned Twin Falls Land and Water Company was reorganized as the shareholder-owned Twin Falls Canal Company. Twin Falls became a major regional economic center serving the agriculture industry, a role which it has sustained to the present day. The city became a processing center for several agricultural commodities, notably beans and sugar beets. In later years, other food-processing operations augmented the local economy. By 1960, Twin Falls had become one of Idaho&#x27;s largest cities, though its origins were still within living memory for many.

Twin Falls became the center of national attention in September 1974, when daredevil Evel Knievel attempted to jump the Snake River Canyon in a specially modified rocket cycle. Watched by millions on closed-circuit television on a Sunday afternoon, the attempt ultimately failed due to high winds and a premature deployment of Knievel&#x27;s parachute. The launch ramp&#x27;s foundation lies on private land on the canyon&#x27;s south rim. Less than 2 miles west (3 km) of Shoshone Falls, it is still visible ().

During the last quarter of the 20th century, gradual diversification of the agriculture-based economy allowed the city to continue to grow. Major Twin Falls employers in 2006 included Dell, Glanbia and Jayco. In September 2009, Dell announced it would close its Twin Falls facility by January 2010. Later in 2010, the call center company C3 opened a facility in the former Dell location.

The College of Southern Idaho had administered a refugee program in Twin Falls from 1980 until 2024, when management was taken over by the United States Committee for Refugees and Immigrants. 

==Government==
Twin Falls is one of only three Idaho cities that has a council-manager form of government. The seven-member Twin Falls city council is directly elected in nonpartisan municipal elections to four-year terms. The mayor, who holds little executive power, is periodically selected among current city council members to chair meetings, and is &quot;considered the official representative of the city.&quot; City council meetings are usually held on Mondays.

The city&#x27;s day-to-day operations are overseen by a city manager, who is appointed by the city council. The city government through various citizen boards oversees parks and recreation, planning and zoning, sanitation and garbage collection, street maintenance, and wastewater collection, and maintains police and fire departments. Twin Falls Public Library, Twin Falls Municipal Golf Course and Joslin Field-Magic Valley Regional Airport are also under the city&#x27;s jurisdiction.

==Higher education==
Twin Falls is home to the College of Southern Idaho (CSI), a large community college in the northwestern part of the city. The three state universities (Boise State University, Idaho State University, and the University of Idaho) offer classes on the CSI campus. The nursing program received money from the 2007-2008 state budget to construct a state-of-the-art nursing facility to complement the nursing program. The CSI men&#x27;s basketball team won its third NJCAA Division I Championship in March 2011.

==Primary and secondary schools==
Public schools are administered by the Twin Falls School District, including Twin Falls High School, Canyon Ridge High School, the alternative Magic Valley High School, three middle schools, and nine elementary schools. Also, Twin Falls is home to Xavier Charter School and the district was awarded best title 1C district in the state.
On March 14, 2006, registered voters approved a bond to build an additional high school. A citywide contest was held to determine the school&#x27;s nickname. In November 2006, the Twin Falls school board selected &quot;River Hawks&quot;, thus officially starting the Canyon Ridge High School River Hawks. Also on the bond were plans to make general improvements to existing school facilities and to convert the junior high schools to middle schools. These projects were completed for the 2009–10 school year. The addition of Canyon Ridge High School meant that the student population was split nearly in half. Athletics for both schools are designated 4A rather than 5A by Idaho High School Activities Association

In November 2009, a new Walmart Supercenter opened, bringing to the region an estimated 100 additional jobs. In October 2010, C3, a customer call center, opened in the former Dell facility. This gave a large boost to an already busy economy, providing close to 1,000 jobs. In July 2011, C3 announced it was filling another 300 C3 jobs in Twin Falls due to brisk business.

Creating 40-50 new jobs, Magic Valley Cinema 13 constructed a new theater equipped with D-BOX seating. The new entertainment center was developed in association with the unprecedented growth in the Magic Valley.

In response to a growing population base, Twin Falls County voters voted to construct a new hospital in the northwest section of Twin Falls to replace the city&#x27;s existing hospital. In spring 2011, the new 700,000-sq-ft facility, St. Luke&#x27;s Magic Valley, was opened. All 186 rooms are private with family accommodations.
China Mountain Wind, LLC in 2011 had proposed to construct a wind farm after the environmental impact is weighed. Twin Falls County was expected to generate $33.4 million in tax revenues. Local schools and services were receive a portion of the tax revenue. The construction of the wind farm was to bring to the area 400-750 full- and part-time jobs during construction and 24-46 new jobs to maintain the facility.

In 2012, Twin Falls hosted the Idaho Republican Party convention, which was expected to create more positive economic activity.

==Transportation==
Twin Falls is the largest city in Idaho that is not directly on the Interstate Highway System; it is served by several major highways, including U.S. Route 30 and U.S. Route 93. Access to nearby Interstate 84 is across the canyon via the Perrine Bridge (U.S. 93); the junction is about north, in Jerome County. State Highway 74 provides direct access from downtown Twin Falls to southbound locations on U.S. 93, including Hollister and Rogerson, then crosses into Nevada at Jackpot and continues to a junction with Interstate 80 at Wells.

Limited commercial air service is provided at Magic Valley Regional Airport, also known as Joslin Field. As of August 2017, daily flights to Salt Lake City are available from Delta Connection (fulfilled by SkyWest Airlines) using the Canadair CRJ200. Twice-weekly service to Las Vegas was previously operated by Allegiant Air, but the airline discontinued the route in January 2012, citing insufficient ticket prices.

When Twin Falls surpassed a population of 50,000, it became federally required to provide a public transportation system for its citizens. (Read Metropolitan planning organization for more information.) On July 1, 2023, the city of Twin Falls launched a microtransit system known as Ride TFT (Twin Falls Transit). It was initially launched as a pilot program and was to run for two years. However, in late January 2024, it was found to have quickly become a success in the community. While officials expected around 2,000 riders per month. In its first month, it had a ridership of 3,200. It has consistently gone up since, nearly tripling initial projections during the month of December 2023. Typical fare is $3.00 a ride within the city of Twin Falls boundary.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is covered by water.

The Snake River Canyon forms the city&#x27;s northern limits, separating it from Jerome County. Three waterfalls are in the immediate area. Shoshone Falls is located about east of Twin Falls city. Pillar Falls is located roughly upstream from the Perrine Bridge, while Twin Falls, the city&#x27;s namesake, is located upstream of Shoshone Falls.

Shoshone Falls stands at , which is higher than Niagara Falls.
The Perrine Bridge, which spans the Snake River Canyon immediately north of the city, is one of only a handful of artificial structures worldwide where BASE jumping is legal. In September 2005, Miles Daisher of Twin Falls set a BASE-jumping world record by jumping off Perrine Bridge 57 times in a 24-hour period. In July 2006, Dan Schilling jumped off the bridge 201 times in 21 hours to raise money for charity. Unlike Daisher, Schilling was hoisted to the top of the bridge by a crane after every jump.

==History==
Native Americans were the first inhabitants of the McCall area. Three tribes, the Tukudika (a sub-band of the Shoshone known as the &quot;Sheepeaters&quot;), the Shoshone, and the Nez Perce, inhabited the land primarily in the summer and migrated during the harsh winter months.

In the early 19th century, mountain men including the nomadic French Canadian fur trapper François Payette, Jim Bridger, Peter Skene Ogden, and Jedediah Smith passed through the area.

During the 1860s, miners temporarily named the settlement &quot;Lake City&quot;, but only alluvial gold was discovered, so the temporary establishment was abandoned as most mining activity moved north to the town of Warren.

The settlement of McCall was established by Thomas and Louisa McCall in 1889. For a cabin and assumed rights to the of land, they traded a team of horses with Sam Dever, who held the squatter rights. Tom, his wife, four sons and a daughter lived in the cabin located on the shore of the lake, near present-day Hotel McCall. He established a school, hotel, saloon, and post office, and named himself postmaster. McCall purchased a sawmill from the Warren Dredging company and later sold it to the Hoff &amp; Brown Lumber Company, which would become a major employer until its closure in 1977.

During this time Anneas &quot;Jews Harp Jack&quot; Wyatte provided the first recreational sailboat rides around the lake for tourists and advertised in Boise&#x27;s &quot;Idaho Statesman&quot; a &quot;30-foot sailing yacht for the use of parties who might visit the lake&quot;. &quot;The Statesman&quot; referred to McCall as a &quot;pleasure resort.&quot;

Tourism continued in the early 20th century. In June 1902, the Boydstun Hotel in nearby Lardo opened as a &quot;place to stay and camp on Payette Lake&quot;. In 1906, Charlie Nelson opened a tented camping area known as Sylvan Beach Resort along the west side of Payette Lake. In 1907, Lardo Inn opened for business. The arrival of the Oregon Short Line Railroad (a subsidiary of the Union Pacific Railroad) in 1914 secured McCall as a viable community and tourist destination. The Town of McCall was officially incorporated on 19 July 1911.
The town&#x27;s annual winter carnival started in 1923–24. Reports vary between hundreds to thousands of tourists visiting the festivities.

The beauty of McCall and Payette Lake drew attention from Hollywood in 1938 when it was selected as the filming location for the Academy Award-nominated &quot;Northwest Passage&quot;, starring Spencer Tracy, Robert Young, and Walter Brennan. The film, released in 1940, was set during the French and Indian War of 1755–63 in eastern North America, Idaho&#x27;s forests substituting for the woods of New England and the Upper Midwest.

In 1943, the U.S. Forest Service opened the McCall smokejumper base, one of eight smokejumper training bases in the nation. The site includes a smokejumper training unit, paraloft, dispatch office, and the McCall air tanker base at the airport.

After World War II, a consortium of businessmen and doctors from Lewiston, to the north, decided that McCall and the lake were an ideal recreation site and thus the town was transformed from lumber to tourism. The iconic Shore Lodge opened on 3 July 1948, at Shellworth Beach on Payette Lake. The lodge became McCall&#x27;s centerpiece for the next 51 years. Shore Lodge management and shareholders intentionally created a resort-style lodge that was a cozy and intimate place for locals and tourists, contrasting with the glamor and glitz of the other famous Idaho lodge in Sun Valley. It was turned into a private club in 1999, then it re-opened to the public in 2008. One of Shore Lodge&#x27;s first summer employees was University of Idaho student John Ascuaga of Notus, who worked as a bellhop learning the business from the bottom up and was to go on to found the Nugget hotel, convention center, and casino in Sparks, Nevada, one of the largest and most successful in the Reno, Nevada area.

In 1965, a peninsula outside of McCall became Ponderosa State Park, home to large old-growth trees.

==Alpine skiing==
McCall&#x27;s Little Ski Hill, formerly the &quot;Payette Lakes Ski Area,&quot; is west of town on Highway 55, just over the county line in Adams County. Opened in 1937 as a diversion for local forest workers, its were donated by Carl Brown. The Little Ski Hill was the second ski area in Idaho, after Sun Valley, which opened a year earlier. It currently operates a T-bar surface lift and has a vertical drop of , with a summit of above sea level, and its slopes face north and west. The aging Nordic ski jump on the lower north slope, overlooking the bend in Highway 55, was removed in the 1990s.

Brundage Mountain, northwest of McCall, opened in November 1961. With the addition of two new lifts in summer 2007, it currently has five chairlifts and one Magic Carpet lift. Brundage has a summit elevation of above sea level, and a vertical drop of . The slopes on Brundage Mountain are primarily west-facing and the mountain&#x27;s average snowfall exceeds . The resort operates a backcountry snowcat skiing operation which provides guided access to of untracked powder in the Payette National Forest north of the ski area. Brundage was owned by the DeBoer family, descendants of early McCall pioneers, until Judd DeBoer&#x27;s passing in 2020. Until April 2006, it was co-owned by J. R. Simplot.

Tamarack Resort (2004–09) is southwest of McCall, on the west side of Cascade Reservoir. Originally conceived as &quot;Valbois&quot; in the early 1980s, the project was revived as &quot;WestRock&quot; in the late 1990s and ultimately renamed &quot;Tamarack&quot; in 2002. Tamarack opened for lift-served skiing on December 15, 2004, with a summit elevation of on West Mountain, up Rock Creek. Its vertical drop was over ; it used five chairlifts and a poma lift. The slopes on Tamarack faced east, overlooking the Cascade Reservoir and Long Valley. The resort went into bank receivership in February 2008 and ceased operations a year later, on the evening of Wednesday, March 4, 2009. The ski area was closed for the 2009–10 season, but re-opened in December 2010 with limited operations.

<doc id="110790" wikidata="Q514160" url="?curid=110790" title="Weiser, Idaho">
<text>Weiser ( ) is a city and the county seat of Washington County, Idaho. With its mild climate, the city supports farm, orchard, and livestock endeavors in the vicinity. The city sits at the confluence of the Weiser River with the great Snake River, which marks the border with Oregon. The population was 5,507 at the 2010 census.

==History==

The city was named after the nearby Weiser River, but exactly who that was named for is not precisely known. In one version it is for Peter M. Weiser, a soldier and member of the Lewis and Clark Expedition of 1804–1806. Another has it for Jacob Weiser, a trapper-turned-miner who struck it rich in Baboon Gulch in the Florence Basin of Idaho in 1861. 
William Logan and his wife Nancy were the first white settlers in the vicinity of Weiser in 1863 building a roadhouse in anticipation of the opening of Olds Ferry west of them on the Snake River across from Farewell Bend. In 1863, Reuben Olds acquired a franchise from the Territorial Legislature and began operating Olds Ferry. Olds ferry business did well (as did Logan&#x27;s) as it diverted much of the traffic from the old Snake River crossing point at Old Fort Boise. Increasing settlement on the Weiser River valley increased Weiser&#x27;s population. A post office was established in 1866 as Weiser Ranch. In 1871, it was renamed Weiser.
Weiser reached its height of prosperity when a railroad way station was established and it became a transportation hub for travelers. Its history is well represented by the great number of original buildings from the 1890s and early 1900s that are on the National Register of Historic Places.

During the 1890s, the city had pretensions of becoming a major regional market and transportation center. The Idaho Northern Railroad was built up the Weiser River with the intention of reaching Lewiston and river transportation to the ocean. The dream ended among the lumber mills of central Idaho almost at the community of Meadows... not needing to actually go past the stock loading and lumber ponds outside the village, the terminus station was built there and a new city, New Meadows, came into being. Likewise the Union Pacific, after taking over the Oregon Short Line chose not to locate its major section yards in the flats west of Weiser—probably due to inflated prices asked by land speculators—and built at Huntington, Oregon at the western edge of the Snake River valley.

Hall of Fame pitcher Walter Johnson played semi-pro baseball for the Weiser Kids as a young man in 1906–1907. After high school in Fullerton, California, the &quot;Big Train&quot; was lured to Weiser to play baseball and work for the local telephone company. While in Weiser, he once pitched 84 consecutive scoreless innings. His skills drew the attention of the Washington Nationals, who sent scout Cliff Blankenship to offer Johnson a contract, and in July 1907 he departed Idaho for the major leagues at age nineteen.

U.S. Route 95 runs through the city, connecting to Oregon and British Columbia.

==Culture==
Weiser bills itself as the &quot;Fiddling Capital of the World&quot; and the National Oldtime Fiddlers&#x27; Contest has been held each year since 1953. Fiddling contests have been held in Weiser since 1914, but the present festival was the idea of Blaine Stubblefield, a fiddler and folk music collector, and the head of the city&#x27;s chamber of commerce. The festival is held at the beginning of summer, during the third full week in June, the only exception occurring during leap years when it is held on the 4th week of the month. It draws national media coverage and over 7,000 people to the Weiser area.

The city has been consistently served by the Weiser Signal-American, the local weekly newspaper.

For many years Weiser&#x27;s location as the last city upriver from Hells Canyon made it the jump-off point for wilderness tours by powered rubber raft down the gorge. Enormous sturgeon and plentiful salmon were a draw for anglers. The salmon runs ended not long after the float tours with the blocking of the river by three hydro-power dams built by Idaho Power Company starting in the 1950s.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , all of it land.

Unincorporated Annex, Oregon, sits across the Snake River.

===Climate===
Weiser experiences a semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;) with cold winters and hot, dry summers.
==Economy==
 employment at the hospital and school system includes jobs which have university education as a prerequisite, but not many other jobs in Weiser have that requirement.

==History==

===Early history===

Quincy&#x27;s location along the Mississippi River has attracted settlers for centuries. The French became the first European presence to colonize the region, after Louis Jolliet, Jacques Marquette, Jamison Knapp and the La Salle Expeditions explored the Upper Mississippi River Valley. Fur goods became a valuable commodity of the region, and European explorers and merchants alike were attracted to the prospects of the growing fur trade of the North American frontier. The Mississippi River, acting as a superhighway for transporting goods downstream, became the area&#x27;s most vital transportation asset.

Following the events of the Seven Years&#x27; War, which ended in 1763, Great Britain took control of New France, and the area that is now Illinois became part of the Indian Reserve. After the American Revolutionary War a few decades later, the area became part of the Northwest Territory of the United States, and eventually the State of Illinois in 1818.

===19th century===
After the War of 1812, the American government granted military tracts to veterans as a means to help populate the West. Peter Flinn, having acquired the land from veteran Mark McGowan for his military service in 1819, ended up selling of land acquisitions to Moravia, New York native John Wood for $60 (~$ in ). John Wood later founded Quincy, which at the time was coined Bluffs, Illinois.

In 1825, Bluffs renamed their community Quincy and became the seat of government for Adams County, both named after newly elected President John Quincy Adams. In addition, they originally named the town square John Square until eventually changing it to Washington Square. In December 1830, Peter Felt, who had recently arrived with his family from New Hampshire, and others held the first service at what would become the first congregational churches in the state. In June 1834, Quincy was incorporated, with Archibald Williams, Joseph T. Holmes, S. W. Rogers, Levi Wells, and Michael Mast elected as trustees. Quincy incorporated as a city in 1840, with Ebenezer Moore elected as its first mayor.

In 1837, following the signing of Missouri Executive Order 44, which called for the expulsion of Mormons from Missouri and the extermination of those who refused, many members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints fled persecution in Missouri and found shelter in Quincy. Despite being vastly outnumbered by Mormon refugees, residents provided food and lodging for the displaced people. Joseph Smith then led members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints upstream to Nauvoo, Illinois, in hopes of finding a permanent home. Also in 1838, Quincy sheltered the Pottawatomie tribe as they were forcibly relocated from Indiana to Kansas.
The 1850s and 1860s brought increased prosperity to Quincy. Steamboats and railroads began linking Quincy to places west, making the city a frequent destination for immigrants. The founding of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad in 1855, and the construction of the Quincy Rail Bridge, were major drivers for creating a transportation hub in the region to further commerce. It is during this time that the city&#x27;s population grew enormously, from just under 7,000 residents in 1850 to 24,000 by 1870, helping Quincy surpass Peoria in becoming the second-largest city in the state (at that time).

One famous former resident of Quincy is George E. Pickett. The future Confederate general as a young man came to Quincy to live, and learn the law, from his uncle Alexander Johnson in the 1840s. Johnson was acquainted with Abraham Lincoln, and Pickett and Lincoln may have even met each other in Quincy.

In 1860, Quincy founder and Lieutenant Governor John Wood inherited the governorship after William H. Bissell died while in office. At the time, he was overseeing business interests and the construction of his mansion. The Illinois legislature allowed him to stay in Quincy during his tenure, effectively making Quincy a &quot;second&quot; capitol for the state. His absence from the official governor&#x27;s office in Springfield provided Abraham Lincoln a space for planning his presidential run.
Slavery was a major religious and social issue in Quincy&#x27;s early years. The Illinois city&#x27;s location, separated only by the Mississippi River from the slave state of Missouri, which was a hotbed of political controversy on the issue, made Quincy itself a hotbed of political controversy on slavery. Richard Eells, who was a staunch abolitionist, built his home in Quincy in 1835 and sheltered formerly enslaved people who had escaped and were on their way to Chicago. His home became a major stop on the Underground Railroad. The divide over slavery climaxed in 1858, when Quincy hosted the sixth Senatorial debate by U.S. Senator Stephen A. Douglas and his challenger, Abraham Lincoln. With a crowd of 12,000 in attendance, Quincy was the largest community at which Lincoln and Douglas debated.

Lincoln and Douglas again confronted each other in the 1860 Presidential election and the resulting campaign again divided Quincy and the surrounding region. Lincoln enthusiasts and Quincy&#x27;s chapter of the Republican Party&#x27;s para-military organization &quot;Wide Awakes&quot;, while en route to a political rally in Plainville, marched upon nearby Payson, which was a community predominantly filled with Douglas supporters. Although a confrontation was avoided while en route to Plainville, Douglas supporters shot upon the Wide Awakes on their journey back to Quincy, resulting in a skirmish known as the Stone Prairie Riots.

The Civil War brought increasing prosperity to Quincy. Although the battles took place far from the city, Quincy was the organization site for several Illinois volunteer work infantry regiments, including the Union Army’s 16th, 50th, 78th, 84th, 119th, 137th, 138th, and 151st. Following the Reconstruction Era, Quincy was selected as the location for Illinois&#x27; first Veteran&#x27;s Home in 1886.

===Immigration to Quincy===
Early immigrants to Quincy came predominately from the Upper South but were followed later by those from New England, seeking better land. They brought with them progressive values, such as public education and abolitionism. Starting in the 1840s, migrants from Germany settled in Quincy to escape revolutions among the German provinces and conflicts between the European powers. German migrants mainly lived in close proximity to one another and settled predominantly in the southern parts of the city, influencing much of Quincy&#x27;s historic architecture and creating the South Side German Historic District. Collectively, the south side of Quincy became known as &quot;Calftown&quot;, due to the fact that nearly every household possessed a cow. Among the notable German-Americans from Quincy&#x27;s Southside was Louise Maertz (1837–1918), a nurse during the American Civil War.

In 1860, a group of Franciscan friars founded the St. Francis Solanus College, which later developed into Quincy University.

===20th and 21st centuries===
Throughout the 19th century, Quincy had grown from a backwater hamlet along the Mississippi River to become one of the state&#x27;s most important cities and ports. Activity from rail and steamboat continued to flourish and Quincy benefited from the increased traffic. It was during the early decades of the 20th century that many of the city&#x27;s historic buildings in the Downtown Quincy Historic District were constructed, including the city&#x27;s first skyscraper, the Western Catholic Union Building, in 1925.

The increasing presence of the automobile led Quincy to consider alternatives to Mississippi River crossings. Prior to the automobile, the most common means of crossing the near-mile wide river was by boat or ferry. In 1928, construction began on the Memorial Bridge which was a two-lane truss toll bridge; it opened in May 1930. By 1945, the city had repaid its outstanding bonds and eliminated the toll.

On April 12, 1945, a tornado ripped through the business district of Quincy and severely damaged the courthouse. The wind was so severe that it blew the roof off the structure, damaging it beyond repair. Because the incident occurred a few hours after news reached Quincy of President Roosevelt&#x27;s death, several residents joked that &quot;FDR and God were just fighting over the power-up there.&quot; Five years passed before a new courthouse was completed.

On September 27, 1976, three improvised explosive devices were detonated at the Colt Industries Inc. Quincy Compressor Division Plant. A team of EOD Specialists from Fort Leonard Wood, in the area in support of the Secret Service during a visit to Quincy by Republican Vice-Presidential candidate Bob Dole, was called to respond. A fourth unexploded IED was discovered by Quincy firefighters during a search of the plant. During an examination of the device, it detonated, killing the EOD team supervisor, Sergeant Major Kenneth Foster, Sr. and seriously injuring the Illinois State Arson Inspector. 

In 1987, the cable-stayed Bayview Bridge was constructed with the intent of alleviating traffic on the aging Memorial Bridge. Today, both bridges complement each other by carrying westbound (Bayview) and eastbound (Memorial) traffic. Although the lighting was originally intended for the Bayview Bridge during its construction phase, the actual installation of lights didn&#x27;t occur until 2015.

During the Mississippi River flood of 1993, riverside businesses and industries suffered extensive damage when the river crested at a record 32.2 feet (9.81 m), above flood stage. For a time, the Bayview Bridge, one of Quincy&#x27;s two bridges, was the only bridge open across the Mississippi River between Alton, Illinois and Burlington, Iowa. The Memorial Bridge was closed from the end of June, due to water over its western approach. On July 16, 1993, the Bayview Bridge closed when the river submerged the land on the west side of the Mississippi River at Taylor, Missouri; Quincy&#x27;s bridges reopened 73 days later on September 26, 1993.

On November 19, 1996, the United Express Flight 5925 collided on landing at Quincy with another Beechcraft, a private King Air, that was taking off from an intersecting runway. All occupants of both planes, twelve on board the 5925 and two on board the King Air, were killed as a result.

A flood in June 2008 submerged much of Quincy&#x27;s riverfront and low-lying regions not protected by the bluffs. Record Mississippi River levels occurred on June 22, 2008. The Red Cross accepted donations for Quincy and other communities in Adams County, as natural disaster funds were depleted in 2010.

Quincy has been twice recognized as an All-America City and is a participant in the Tree City USA program. In the fall of 2010, Forbes Magazine listed Quincy as the eighth &quot;Best Small City To Raise A Family.&quot;

===Architecture===

Quincy is home to a diverse and vibrant collection of buildings that have come to be a tourist attraction in and of themselves. South of downtown is the South Side German Historic District, which holds many of the German-influenced structures that early immigrants built. A central site in the district is the &quot;Dick Brothers Brewery&quot; Buildings, which were constructed in 1857 and rivaled many larger breweries. The lager tunnel system and natural aquifer can still be found underground. Although the brewery survived Prohibition by bottling water and other beverages, slow modernization efforts forced the brewery into bankruptcy. However, the buildings remain and are being renovated for public use and commercial space. Other examples of rich German-influence in Quincy can also be seen in the many brick homes within the district.

Francis Hall of Quincy University is another example of German influence in the city&#x27;s structures.

Other than the South Side, Maine Street and the East End are popular strips where Quincy&#x27;s rich architectural history is displayed. Once housing some of Quincy&#x27;s elite, many of the homes in these regions are influenced mainly by Victorian schools. Known residents of this part of town included Richard Newcomb and city founder John Wood. Today, the Newcomb residence functions as the &quot;Quincy Museum&quot; and was once featured on the cover of National Geographic as &quot;one of the most architecturally significant corners in the United States.&quot; There are many organizations in the town that continue to oversee renovations to structures, such as the Historical Society of Quincy &amp; Adams County, and some residents allow for tours of their 19th Century homes.

There is also a significant Mediterranean influence to Quincy with the Villa Kathrine and B&#x27;nai Sholom Temple. In 1900, Quincy resident W. George Metz commissioned George Behrensmeyer to design a Moroccan-style home overlooking the river. It included a harem, courtyard, and reflecting pool. Today, the Villa Kathrine functions as the visitor&#x27;s center. The Temple B&#x27;nai Sholom is another structure that was heavily influenced by the Moorish revival in the United States.

Illinois Route 57 branches south from U.S. 24 downtown and passes Quincy&#x27;s Civic Center on its way to Interstate 172 southeast of the city. Illinois 96 also serves as the Great River Road, which follows the path of the Mississippi River. Eastbound U.S. 24 crosses the Mississippi River from Missouri on the Quincy Memorial Bridge, while westbound traffic uses the newer Bayview Bridge. Bayview bridge was constructed in 1986, but was not built as a four-lane bridge because of budget cuts, as the cable suspension made it unaffordable to build a four-lane bridge. Other groups claimed that business in the downtown part of Quincy would decline if the Memorial bridge was shut down.

<text>Cairo ( , sometimes ) is the southernmost city in Illinois and the county seat of Alexander County. A river city, Cairo has the lowest elevation of any location in Illinois and is the only Illinois city to be surrounded by levees. It is in the river-crossed area of Southern Illinois known as &quot;Little Egypt&quot;, for which the city is named, after Egypt&#x27;s capital on the Nile. The city is coterminous with Cairo Precinct.

The city is located at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, two of the largest rivers in North America, and is near the Cache River complex, a Wetland of International Importance. Settlement began in earnest in the 1830s and busy river boat traffic expanded through the 1850s. Fort Defiance, a Civil War base, was located here in 1862 by Union General Ulysses S. Grant to control strategic access to the rivers, and launch and supply his successful campaigns south. The town also served as a naval base for the Mississippi River Squadron to pursue the Anaconda Plan to win the war. Developed as a river port, Cairo was later bypassed by transportation changes away from the large expanse of low-lying land, wetland, and water, which surrounds Cairo and makes such infrastructure difficult, and due to industrial restructuring, the population peaked at 15,203 in 1920, while in the 2020 census it was 1,733.

Several blocks in the town comprise the Cairo Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The Old Customs House is also on the NRHP. The city is part of the Cape Girardeau–Jackson metropolitan area.

The entire city was evacuated during Mississippi River floods in 2011, after the Ohio River rose higher than the 1937 flood levels, with the possibility of 15 feet of water inundating Cairo. The United States Army Corps of Engineers breached levees in the Mississippi flood zone near Cairo in Missouri to prevent flooding in Cairo and other more populous areas farther downstream along both the Ohio and Mississippi rivers.

==History==

===Beginnings===

Cairo was named after the Egyptian city of the same name because its location at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers was reminiscent of the Nile Delta.

The first municipal charter for Cairo and the Bank of Cairo were issued in 1818, but without any settlement and without any depositors. A second and successful effort to establish a town was made by the Cairo City and Canal Company in 1836–37, with a large levee built to encircle the site. However, this effort collapsed in 1840, with few settlers remaining.

Charles Dickens visited Cairo in 1842, and was unimpressed. The city would serve as his prototype for the nightmare City of Eden in his novel &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot;. In 1846, 10,000 acres in Cairo were purchased by the trustees of the Cairo City Property Trust, a group of investors including writer John Neal who planned to make it the terminus of the projected Illinois Central Railroad, which finally arrived there in 1855.

Cairo had been growing as an important river port for steamboats, which traveled all the way south to New Orleans. The city had been designated as a port of delivery by Act of Congress in 1854.

A new city charter was written in 1857, and Cairo flourished as trade with Chicago to the north spurred development. By 1860, the population exceeded 2,000.
During the Civil War, Admiral Andrew Hull Foote made Cairo the naval station for the Mississippi River Squadron on September 6, 1861. Since Cairo had no land available for base facilities, the navy yard repair shop machinery was afloat aboard wharf-boats, old steamers, tugs, flat-boats, and rafts. In January 1862, General Ulysses S. Grant occupied the city, and had Fort Defiance constructed to protect the confluence. Cairo became an important Union supply base and training center for the remainder of the war.

Military occupation caused much of the city&#x27;s trade to be diverted by railroad to Chicago. Cairo failed to regain this important trade after the war, as more railroads converged on Chicago and it developed at a rapid pace, attracting stockyards, meat processing, and heavy industries. Instead, agriculture, lumber, and sawmills now dominated the Cairo economy.

===Post-war prosperity===

The strategic importance of Cairo&#x27;s geographic location during the Civil War sparked prosperity in the town. Several banks were founded during the war years, and the growth in banking and steamboat traffic continued after the war.

In 1869, construction began on the United States Custom House and Post Office, which was designed by Alfred B. Mullet, the Supervising Architect. The custom house was completed in 1872. It served as a custom house, post office, and United States Court. The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois met at the building until 1905.

From 1905 to 1942, the Custom House was used for the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Illinois. The building also housed the U.S. Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Illinois from 1905 to 1912. At the height of Cairo&#x27;s prosperity, the post office in the building was the third busiest in the United States. It is one of only seven of Mullet&#x27;s Victorian structures remaining in the nation, and the building has been converted for use as a museum. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

After the Civil War, the city became a hub for railroad shipping in the region, which added to its economy. By 1900 several railroad lines branched from Cairo. In addition to shipping and railroads, a major industry in Cairo was the operation of ferries. Into the late 19th century, nearly 250,000 railroad cars could be ferried across the river in as little as six months. Vehicles were also ferried, as there were no automobile bridges in the area in the early 20th century. The ferry industry created numerous jobs in Cairo to handle large amounts of cargo and numerous passengers through the city.

Wealthy merchants and shippers built numerous fine mansions in the 19th and early 20th century, including the Italianate &quot;Magnolia Manor&quot;, completed in 1872, and the Second Empire &quot;Riverlore Mansion&quot;, built by Capt. William P. Halliday in 1865. Across the street from the customs house, the Cairo Public Library was constructed in 1883 of Queen Anne-style architecture, finished with stained glass windows and ornate woodwork. The library was dedicated on July 19, 1884, as the A. B. Safford Memorial Library. Anna E. Safford paid for the construction of the Library and donated it to the city. These and other significant buildings are also listed on the National Register.

For protection from seasonal flooding, Cairo is completely enclosed by a series of levees and flood walls, due to its low elevation between the rivers. Several buildings, including the old custom house, were originally designed to be built to a higher street level, to be at the same height as the top of the levees. That plan was scrapped as the cost of fill to raise the streets and surrounding land to that height proved to be impractical. In 1914, a large flood gate was constructed by Stupp Brothers of St. Louis, Missouri. The flood gate is known as the &quot;Big Subway Gate&quot;, and it was designed to seal the northern levee in Cairo by closing over U.S. Highway 51. The gate weighs 80 tons, is 60 feet wide, 24 feet high, and five feet thick. With the addition of the gate, Cairo could become an island, completely sealed off from approaching flood waters.

Following the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, the levee system around Cairo was strengthened. As part of this project, the Corps of Engineers established the Birds Point-New Madrid Floodway. The Ohio River flood of 1937 brought a record water level to Cairo that crested at 59.5 feet. To protect Cairo, Corps of Engineers closed the flood gate and blew a breach in the Bird&#x27;s Point levee for the first time to relieve pressure on the Cairo flood wall. Following the flood, the concrete flood wall was raised to its current height. It is designed to protect the town from flood waters up to 64 feet.

In 1942, the federal government constructed a new U.S. Post Office and Courthouse in Cairo. Still growing, the city had a population approaching 15,000. The new federal court house, located at 1500 Washington, was designed by the architects Louis A. Simon and George Howe. The U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Illinois moved into the new courthouse in 1942, from the old U.S. Custom House and Post Office.

After the U.S. district court structure in Illinois was reorganized in 1978, the court house was used for the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois. The building remains in use by the federal courts and as the active post office for Cairo. The courthouse was built and is operated by the U.S. General Services Administration.

===Lynchings===

Cairo&#x27;s turbulent history of race relations is marked by the 1909 spectacle lynching of black resident William James. In 1900, Cairo had a population of nearly 13,000. Of that total, approximately 5,000 residents were African-American, or 38 percent. In 1900, this was an unusually high black population for a town of Cairo&#x27;s size in the North. Five percent of all black residents in the state of Illinois lived here. Later in the early 20th century, Chicago became the center of black life in the state, as it was the destination of tens of thousands of migrants during the Great Migration.

The Illinois constitution of 1818 allowed for limited slavery in the salt mines and allowed current slave owners to retain their slaves. The General Assembly also passed legislation that severely curtailed the rights of free blacks residing in the state and discouraged the migration of free blacks. If a black person was unable to present proof of their freedom they could be fined $50 or sold by the sheriff to the highest bidder. Not long after the passage of the constitution, the state&#x27;s general assembly adopted a pro-slavery resolution that announced its approval of slavery in slave-holding states and at the same time condemned the formation of abolition societies within Illinois’ boundaries.

Although Black people comprised a large proportion of the Cairo population, they were frequently discriminated against in jobs and housing. Race relations were strained in 1900. The state passed an anti-lynching law in 1905.

On the night of November 11, 1909, two men were lynched. The first was William James, an African American accused of the murder of Anna Pelly, a young white woman killed three days earlier, although there was no physical or circumstantial evidence connecting him to the crime. The second man lynched was Henry Salzner, a white man who had allegedly murdered his white wife the previous August.

James was accused of killing Pelly by choking her to death in an alley with pieces of a flour sack on the evening of November 8, 1909. Pelly&#x27;s body was discovered the next morning. Police believed that James was large enough to have committed the crime, especially as there were rumors of an accomplice. James was placed in police custody on Tuesday, where he remained until Wednesday evening. No physical evidence linked him to the crime. As word of the crime spread, whites in Cairo demanded an immediate trial of James, but the case was delayed by the court. The white townspeople grew infuriated by the delay in a speedy trial, and the threat of mob violence quickly developed. On November 10, Sheriff Frank E. Davis arranged to take James out of the city jail on an Illinois Central train to avoid mob violence.
But the increasingly large mob in Cairo learned of this and seized another train, racing to catch up with the sheriff and James. Sheriff Davis&#x27; attempt to save James from the mob proved futile when the mob intercepted Davis and his prisoner. The mob returned James to Cairo and took him to the intersection of Commercial Avenue and Eighth Street. Approximately 10,000 people had gathered for a spectacle lynching as the leaders attempted to hang James from large steel arches that spanned the intersection. The rope broke and James survived the hanging, but members of the armed mob shot him more than 500 times, killing him. The mob dragged James&#x27; body to the scene of Pelly&#x27;s murder. His head was cut from his body and displayed on a pole that was stuck into the ground, and his body was burned.

Hundreds of townspeople conducted a search for the alleged accomplice, Arthur Alexander. Unable to locate him and still bloodthirsty, they entered the court house jail and broke into the cell where Henry Salzner was being held. The mob hanged Salzner from a telegraph pole near the courthouse, and the crowd shot his body many times. After hanging Salzner, the mob continued searching for Alexander long into the night. Police and sheriff deputies located Alexander before the mob did, and they took him to the county jail disguised as a police officer. Some newspapers mistakenly reported that he was lynched.

The mob continued to search for Alexander, also threatening the mayor and chief of police, who were guarded in their homes by more police against the mob. Governor Charles S. Deneen of Illinois dispatched 11 companies of militia to Cairo to suppress the violence. By the time the mob discovered the next morning that Alexander was held at the jail, the soldiers had arrived and prevented further violence.

A group of civil rights activists in Chicago hired journalist Ida B. Wells to investigate the lynchings. After the residents had calmed down, Governor Deneen enforced the 1905 anti-lynching law by dismissing Sheriff Davis for failing to protect James and Salzner. Wells sided with the governor against reinstatement.

===Economic decline===
The slow economic decline of Cairo can be traced to local and regional changes back to the early 20th century. In 1889, the Illinois Central Railroad bridge was completed over the Ohio River, which brought about a decline in ferry business. The immediate economic impact was not severe, as the railroad traffic still was directed through Cairo, and automobile and truck traffic increased in the early 20th century.

In 1905, a second bridge was constructed across the Mississippi River at Thebes, Illinois. The effects of the second bridge were more severe, as rail traffic through Cairo was now reduced and railroad ferry operations were no longer necessary. As the steamboat industry was replaced with barges, river traffic had less reason to stop in Cairo.

In 1929, the Cairo Mississippi River Bridge was completed, linking Missouri with Illinois to the south of Cairo. In 1937, the Cairo Ohio River Bridge was completed. Completion of the two bridges ended the ferry industry in Cairo, putting many people out of work. As the town was bypassed by two bridges to the south, it also lost the benefit of motorist travel and trade between the states. Motorists cross the southern tip of Illinois between Missouri and Kentucky, completely bypassing the city of Cairo. While the city was protected by its levees from destruction when the Ohio River rose to record heights during the 1937 flood, the city&#x27;s economic decline continued.

===Racial tensions and further decline===

Between the 1930s and 1960s, the population in Cairo remained fairly steady; however, many jobs were gone as the shipping, railroad, and ferry industries left the city. Population decline began as workers moved to other cities.

Racial tensions rose in the late 1960s as African-Americans sought implementation of gains under new federal civil rights laws passed as a result of the Civil Rights Movement. The police, fire department, and most city jobs were still overwhelmingly dominated by whites. African-Americans were allegedly harassed by the police and unjustly targeted. On July 16, 1967, Robert Hunt, a 19-year-old black soldier home on leave, was allegedly found hanged in the Cairo police station. Police reported that Hunt had hanged himself with his t-shirt, but many members of the black community of Cairo accused the police of murder. There had been an alleged history of police discrimination and violence against black residents of the city.

The death of Robert Hunt sparked aggressive protests in Cairo&#x27;s black community. On July 17, 1967, a large portion of the black population in Cairo began rioting. The black rioting that erupted in 1967 was not confined to Cairo; it was part of a larger pattern of more than 40 racially motivated riots that broke out in major cities in the United States in the summer of 1967. During the night of rioting on July 17, three stores and a warehouse in Cairo were burned to the ground, and windows were broken out of numerous other buildings. The National Guard unit at Cairo was activated to respond to the violence.

On July 20, 1967, one of the leaders of the violence in Cairo warned white city officials, &quot;Cairo will look like Rome burning down&quot; if city leaders did not meet the demands of the black groups in Cairo by Sunday, July 23, 1967. The spokesman represented approximately one hundred black residents of the Pyramid Court housing project. They demanded new job opportunities, organized recreation programs for their children, and an end to police brutality. Cairo Mayor Lee Stenzel and other city leaders met with federal and state representatives to ensure that a plan was developed to satisfy the demands by the deadline in an effort to head off any additional rioting.

In response to the rioting, the white community in Cairo formed a citizens protection group that was deputized by the sheriff. The protection group became known as the &quot;White Hats&quot;, because many of its 600 members began wearing white construction hats to show their membership while patrolling the streets to maintain order. In the following two years, accusations of White Hat bullying incidents in the black community began to increase. In early 1969, a few activists of the civil rights struggle formed the Cairo United Front, a civil rights organization to bring together the local NAACP, a cooperative association, and a couple of black street gangs. The Cairo United Front was formed to organize the efforts of the black population in Cairo to counter the White Hats. The United Front formally accused the White Hats of intimidating the black community, and presented a list of seven demands to the City of Cairo. The seven demands included appointment of a black police chief, appointment of a black assistant fire chief, and an equal black-white ratio in all city jobs.

Racial violence in Cairo reached a peak during summer 1969 as the Cairo United Front began leading protests and demonstrations to end segregation and draw attention to its seven demands. The protests led to a rash of violence that was stopped only when Illinois Governor Richard Ogilvie deployed National Guardsmen to restore the peace. In summer 1969, the Cairo United Front also began what became a decade-long boycott of white-owned businesses, which had generally not hired blacks as clerks or staff. The boycott encompassed virtually all the businesses in the town.

In December 1969, violence escalated again and several businesses were burned on Saturday, December 6. Early that morning, residents of the Pyramid Courts housing project opened fire on three firemen and the Chief of Police while they were responding to one of the intense fires. During the shootout, the Chief of Police and one of the firemen were shot by a high-powered rifle. Thirteen people were eventually arrested during the conflict. The Cairo Chief of Police resigned the next month, stating that Cairo lacked both the legal and physical means to deal with the &quot;guerrilla warfare tactics&quot; that had left the town in a state of turmoil for over two years.

To enforce the boycott, African-American picketing of businesses continued throughout 1970. In December, the city enacted a new city ordinance banning picketing within 20 feet of a business. Another large violent clash erupted as a result of the new city ordinance. Following the violence, the United Front called for another large rally and resumed picketing at white-owned businesses despite the new ordinance. The picketing turned violent after police heard shots fired and moved on the crowd.

In 1978, the Cairo I-57 Bridge across the Mississippi River was opened. The interstate largely bypassed Cairo to the north, crippling the remaining hospitality industry in the city. Cairo&#x27;s hospital closed in December 1986, due to high debt and a dwindling number of patients.

===Current status===

With the decline in river trade, as has been the case in many other cities on the Mississippi, Cairo has suffered a marked decline in its economy and population. Its highest population was 15,203 in 1920; in 2020 it had 1,733 residents, about an 89% loss of population from its peak a century earlier. The city has decreased in population for eight consecutive US census reports from 1950 to 2020.

The city faces many significant socio-economic challenges for the remaining population, including poverty, crime, issues in education, unemployment and rebuilding its tax base.

The closure of the Elmwood and McBride housing projects was announced by the federal government in 2017. In August 2017, Ben Carson, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development at the time, visited the city. Ten families had found new housing, but an estimated 400 people will be affected by the closure.

The community and region are working to stop abandonment of the city. They are restoring some architectural landmarks, and plan to develop heritage tourism focusing on the city&#x27;s history and relationship to the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. Other cities have used such strategies to attract visitors and build new businesses to their communities.

A community clinic offers medical and dental care, and several mental health services. Local media include the &quot;Cairo Citizen&quot; weekly newspaper. Radio station WKRO is licensed to Cairo.

<text>Thebes is a village in and the former county seat of Alexander County, Illinois, United States. The population was 208 at the 2020 census, down from 436 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Cape Girardeau–Jackson, MO-IL Metropolitan Statistical Area. In 1860 the county seat was moved to Cairo, Illinois, at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers.

== History ==
Thebes was established in 1835. At first it was known as Sparhawk Landing. It was the county seat of Alexander County from 1846 until 1859.

Thebes, like the city of Cairo, also in Alexander County, is named after the Egyptian city of the same name. This part of southern Illinois is known as Little Egypt.

Abraham Lincoln practiced law here. Legend holds that Dred Scott, a slave whose freedom suit reached the Supreme Court, may have been imprisoned in the local courthouse jail for a time while his case was heard. He had claimed freedom after being held in a free state but, setting aside decades of precedent, the US Supreme Court held that African Americans had no rights under the constitution, and slaves had no standing to sue for freedom (see &quot;Dred Scott v. Sanford&quot;).

As the Mississippi River at Thebes is more than four feet deep, the town became a busy steamboat port. Union troops passed through Thebes on their way to attack the South during the American Civil War. Thebes was the site of the lynching of William Johnson on April 26, 1903. Thebes Bridge, an important railroad bridge, opened for rail traffic in 1905 and is still in use today.

In 1923, Thebes elected a woman Nora Gammon to the mayorship and an all-woman slate of alderman, running on a law enforcement platform.

In literature, Thebes is the home village of Captain Andy Hawks, his wife Parthenia Ann Hawks, and daughter Magnolia in the Edna Ferber novel &quot;Show Boat&quot; (1926).

==Geography==
Thebes is located at (37.219177, −89.456915).

According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Thebes has a total area of , of which (or 75.44%) is land and (or 24.56%) is water.

<text>Greenville is a city in Bond County, Illinois, United States, east of St. Louis. The population as of the 2020 census was 7,083, up from 7,000 at the 2010 census. It is the county seat of Bond County.

Greenville is part of the St. Louis Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is also considered part of the Metro East region of Illinois.

Greenville celebrated its Bicentennial in 2015 as one of the oldest communities in Illinois. It is home to Greenville University, the Richard Bock Museum, the American Farm Heritage Museum, the Armed Forces Museum and the Demoulin Museum and a federal prison, Federal Correctional Institution, Greenville (FCI Greenville). It is also home to internationally known companies, including Nevco Scoreboard, the largest privately owned scoreboard company in the world, and DeMoulin Brothers, the world&#x27;s oldest and largest manufacturer of band uniforms.

==History==
Greenville was founded by George Davidson in 1815 in what was then the Illinois Territory, when he purchased along the bluff overlooking Little Shoal Creek, in what was then still part of Madison County. Davidson built a tavern near the present-day intersection of Main and Sixth streets, and by 1816 he was selling individual lots. The federal government established its first federal post office in Greenville in 1819. It was incorporated as a town in 1855 and as a city in 1872. At one time, it had neighborhoods called New Jerusalem, Piety Hill, Cobtown, and Buzzard Roost. A few possible reasons have been put forth for the naming of the town. Some think the town was named after Greenville, North Carolina, which had been named after Revolutionary War general Nathanael Greene. Others say that Greenville was named by early settler Thomas White because it was &quot;so green and nice&quot;. A third possibility is that Greenville was named after Green P. Rice, the town&#x27;s first merchant.

Greenville became the county seat of Bond County in 1821. The earlier seat of Perryville was annexed into Fayette County when it was formed from part of Bond County, requiring the naming of a new seat. Davidson offered to give the county government land around the present-day town square. His offer was accepted, and a courthouse was built in 1821 on the site of the current courthouse.

During the 1840s, some Bond County residents conducted slaves to freedom on the Underground Railroad. Slaves were often spirited from Missouri, sometimes through Carlyle to Bond County. Rev. John Leeper was able to disguise his Underground Railroad activities due to his milling business. Dr. Henry Perrine practiced medicine near Greenville and helped with the secret railroad activities. Rev. George Denny&#x27;s house was found in the 1930s to conceal a secret chamber that had been used in the Railroad.

Greenville University was founded as Almira College, a women&#x27;s college, in 1855. Former GU history professor Donald Jordahl has written that Almira College was &quot;one of the earliest extensions westward of an eastern idea favorable toward female education, an early step in the women&#x27;s suffrage and liberation movement.&quot; In 1941, college president H.J. Long &quot;declared the founding of Almira and Greenville ran parallel, for both were founded on prayer.&quot; Women in Bond County could vote for the first time in 1914.

When Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas gave speeches in Greenville in 1858 during a campaign for the United States Senate, Douglas said: &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great and supreme gratification and pleasure to see this vast concourse of people assembled to hear me upon this my first visit to Old Bond.&quot; The &quot;Illinois State Register&quot; reported of the occasion: &quot;I&#x27;ve seen many gatherings in Old Bond county but I never saw anything equal to this and I never expect to.&quot;

On November 21, 1915, the Liberty Bell passed through Greenville on its nationwide tour returning to Pennsylvania from the Panama–Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. After that trip, the Liberty Bell returned to Pennsylvania and will not be moved again.

The Greenville Public Library was established as a Carnegie library and is on the National Register of Historic Places. Hogue Hall at Greenville College also appeared on the National Register (it was demolished in 2008).

On April 18, 1934, during the Great Depression, a group of 500 protesters marched to the Illinois Emergency Relief Commission to lodge complaints about the delivery of emergency supplies from the state and federal governments.

Illinois native Ronald Reagan visited Greenville on the campaign trail in 1980 and gave a speech on the street in front of the courthouse; his visit is commemorated by a plaque. Barack Obama visited Greenville while campaigning for his Senate seat in 2004, in a visit hosted by the Bond County Democrats.

=== Historic businesses ===
While Greenville once hosted three newspapers, &quot;The Item&quot;, &quot;The Sun&quot;, and &quot;The Advocate&quot;, it now has only the twice-weekly &quot;Greenville Advocate&quot;. &quot;The Advocate&quot; is the oldest business in Bond County and one of the oldest newspapers in Illinois. Original &quot;Advocate&quot; owner Jediah Alexander was friends with Abraham Lincoln and instrumental in bringing Lincoln to Greenville for a visit.

Historic Greenville businesses also include the Helvetia Milk Condensing Company, which later became the Pet Milk Company. The condensing plant, built in 1899, was the oldest in the world for many years until it was torn down in the early 1990s. Pet also maintained its research and testing center in Greenville. Many products. including Instant Pet, Pet-Ritz pies, Sego diet foods, and Old El Paso products were developed there, along with the first use of food irradiation to increase the Vitamin D content of milk. The remaining research buildings and warehouses were sold to Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals in the 1990s, which continues to operate there today.

Other historic businesses in Greenville included shoe manufacturer Mayer and Bannister, cigar manufacturers Thomas D. Scheske and H.H. Wirz, and a glove factory, the Greenville Glove Manufacturing Co. In the early 1900s, Greenville had its own power company, Greenville Electric Gas and Power Company, which later was bought by Illinois Power and Light Service.

The Watson family operated a pharmacy in Greenville for over 125 years, since 1881; it was sold in 2006, but still maintains the name Watson&#x27;s Drug Store. Greenville once had a silent movie theatre, the Lyric, and now has a first-run movie theatre, the Globe.

Bradford National Bank was founded in 1867 by James Bradford and his son Samuel and was originally known as the Banking House of Bradford and Sons. In 1910, the bank received its national charter to become Bradford National Bank. In 2017, the bank celebrated its 150th anniversary and is the 10th oldest bank in Illinois.

Today, the bank has locations in Greenville, Highland, and Marine, Illinois.

==Geography==
Greenville is located near the center of Bond County. U.S. Route 40 and Interstate 70 pass to the south of downtown, both highways leading west to St. Louis and east to Vandalia.

Greenville is also located on Illinois Route 127, which is a major north-south route connecting Southern Illinois to Springfield.

The National Road passes through Greenville. East of Greenville it follows Illinois Route 140, and west it follows U.S. Route 40. Its route west of town was the source of a historic controversy. Original plans were to connect Greenville to St. Louis. However, the Illinois General Assembly preferred a route to Alton to favor an Illinois city directly on the Mississippi River. When federal money for the road ran out in 1840 at Vandalia, 19 miles east of Greenville, the State Legislature refused to fund it further. Residents of Greenville, Highland, Troy, and Collinsville paid to complete the road to East St. Louis. The &quot;State Policy&quot; of favoring Alton over St. Louis remained a major political issue in Illinois until the Civil War.

Though the museum contains examples of many of DeMoulin&#x27;s creations, the lodge initiation devices–including the Bucking Goat; Invisible Paddle Machine; and Lifting and Spraying Machine–are what have attracted visitors from over 30 states.

Ripson Bridge was built in 1895. It is the last pony truss bridge in Bond County and is a local historical landmark that crosses Shoal Creek. The bridge is named after the owner of the property next to the bridge when it was built. The Sorento Homecoming Association was the caretaker of the bridge from the mid-1980s - about 2019. Initially, the Sorento Homecoming Association applied to have Ripson Bridge added to the National Register of Historic Places. However, that process has stopped and the bridge is now owned by private owners.

==Events==
An annual homecoming usually lasting for two days is held every summer normally during August.

A major arts and crafts festival known as the Sorento Fall Festival (formerly the Ripson Bridge Festival) is held in downtown Sorento each autumn, usually on the first Sunday in October. The event features live music throughout the day, children&#x27;s games, an old-fashioned cake walk, and arts and craft vendors.

<doc id="110819" wikidata="Q185609" url="?curid=110819" title="Belvidere, Illinois">
<text>Belvidere is a city in and the county seat of Boone County, Illinois, United States. It is settled on the Kishwaukee River in far northern Illinois. Known as the &#x27;City of Murals&#x27;, Belvidere is home to several public art installations throughout the North and South State Street historic districts, which are on the National Register of Historic Places. These historic districts are home to places like the Boone County Museum of History, the Funderburg House Museum, several restaurants and bars, and antique and boutique stores. Popular festivities like Heritage Days are held yearly. The population was 25,339 as of the 2020 census. Belvidere is part of the Rockford metropolitan area.

==History==

Before the arrival of the mostly Anglo-Americans in the 19th century, this area was long occupied by the Illinois Confederation, a loose grouping of up to 12 to 15 Native American tribes. The main tribes were the Cahokia, Kaskaskia, Michigamea, Peoria, and Tamaroa. After trading, warfare and other encounters with French traders, who entered this area before the Anglo-Americans, their numbers declined. In large part that was due to the high mortality from new infectious diseases, which adversely affected Native Americans across the continent.

The area that developed as Belvidere was first permanently settled by European Americans in 1835: Simon P. Doty and Daniel Hilton Whitney. They named this location next to the Kishwaukee River as &quot;Elysian Fields&quot; from Greek mythology. As many new residents could not pronounce or spell the proposed name, the city was eventually named after Belvidere, Virginia, the former home of Ebenezer Polk, a railroad lawyer and major financial founder in the city.

Belvidere originally developed on the north side of the Kishwaukee River. In 1851 the Galena and Chicago Union Railroad was built south of the river, stimulating relocation of much of the business section to the south side of the river, for access to the railway transportion. Belvidere&#x27;s downtown is now on the south side.

Major industries developed along the river and railroad, including the National Sewing Machine Company, which operated here from 1886 to the 1940s. In 1906, former female sheriff Sarah Ames moved to South Dakota; she named the area where she settled after her home town. Belvidere, South Dakota still operates as a small town in Jackson County.

===1967 tornado===
On April 21, 1967, a devastating tornado struck Belvidere. Twenty-four people died as a result, many of them schoolchildren. The F4 tornado struck at the end of the school day of Belvidere High School, when many children, including those who attended area grade schools, were waiting outside the high school for school buses. Of the sixteen school buses outside the high school, twelve were overturned or thrown by the tornado. The tornado did $22 million in damage, demolished over 100 homes, and injured 500 people. In 2007 a statue was erected in front of Belvidere High School in memorial of the lives lost.

To this date, the Belvidere tornado remains the sixth worst weather disaster to happen at an American school.

===2009 explosion===
On December 7, 2009 an explosion occurred at an NDK America building, when a large pressure vessel ruptured during a crystal-growing process. Pieces of debris, some weighing several tons, were flung over a wide area. One piece struck an automotive supply building and injured an employee inside. Chesterfield native Ronald Greenfield, a truck driver refueling at the nearby Belvidere Oasis truck stop, was struck and killed by a 7-foot support beam. The shockwave was felt over a wide area. No NDK employees were injured in the incident.

The Chemical Safety Board investigated the incident, issuing their final report in 2013. The CSB found that stress corrosion cracking had occurred, unnoticed, in one of the crystal-growing autoclaves, leading to the catastrophic failure. They also found that NDK management had been warned multiple times over the years that the dangerous levels of hot sodium hydroxide inside the vessels would corrode the steel walls. However, NDK management insisted buildup of byproducts from the crystal-growing process would form a protective layer against the corrosion. Furthermore, during the factory&#x27;s construction, the local government had been made aware that NDK&#x27;s crystal-growing vessels were in violation of several state codes; when confronted, NDK had persuaded them to grant a special exception, and to hitherto allow them to conduct their own onsite inspections without outside interference. However, the vessel that ruptured had never been internally inspected to test the &quot;byproduct buildup&quot; theory, during its many years of service. After a smaller leak occurred in January 2007, NDK was warned about safety concerns again, this time by insurance investigators, who were ultimately ignored. Finally, the CSB determined the method for growing crystals used at NDK&#x27;s Belvidere facility was prohibitively dangerous in the first place, pointing out such methods had been already abandoned by other crystal-growing facilities in favor of safer, lower-pressure and lower temperature processes.

Following their own 2010 investigation, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration fined NDK more than half a million dollars for willful disregard for legal requirements, and &quot;unacceptable&quot; indifference to safety and health. The NDK facility was demolished in 2015, with no plans to rebuild.

===2023 tornado===
On March 31, 2023, an EF1 tornado struck Belvidere. It caused the Apollo Theatre to collapse during a concert for the Floridian Death Metal band Morbid Angel and Brazilian Death Metal band Crypta. The concert proceeded despite advanced notice of severe conditions expected that day. The collapse led to over 40 injuries; leaving at least four in critical condition and one fatality.

On January 7, 2008, on an unusually warm day which saw temperatures reach the mid , a tornado struck northern Illinois, including Poplar Grove and Candlewick Lake. The tornado severely damaged a favorite local attraction, Edward&#x27;s Apple Orchard. There was one serious injury reported and the damage was widespread. The tornado was later rated EF3 on the Enhanced Fujita Scale. A weather event this big had not occurred in the area since 1967. The tornado was one of the only eight rated EF3 during the time span of the warm weather, which lasted from January 7 to 10. Although there were no losses, it was still a very severe storm. The following month the cast of the TV show &quot;Storm Chasers&quot; visited Caledonia Elementary School to talk about tornadoes and the effects they have on communities. The students and the &quot;Storm Chasers&quot; were featured on a Rockford&#x27;s &quot;23 WIFR News&quot; story on the January 2008 tornado.

==History==
Mount Sterling was organized in 1854. It did not have a courthouse until 1868, although it was designated the county seat from when the county was organized.

Mount Sterling was one of several Illinois towns that publicly competed for a new state prison in one of the state&#x27;s prison sweepstakes competitions. During the 1987 competition, the town of Flora famously produced the &quot;Is We Is or Is We Isn&#x27;t/Gonna Get Ourselves A Prison&quot; video. Ultimately, Mount Sterling won the 1987 competition and the state constructed the Western Illinois Correctional Center along State Highway 99 a mile south of town. In 1989 immediately prior to opening, the prison hosted a &quot;Spend a night in prison&quot; event for state and local dignitaries and prominent business-owners, an event that ultimately soured some of its participants on the economic value of prisons to small town economies.

<text>Arlington is a village in Bureau County, Illinois, United States. The population was 169 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Ottawa Micropolitan Statistical Area, located east of the Quad Cities, north of Peoria and Galesburg, west of LaSalle and Peru, and southwest of Rockford and Chicago.

==History==
In the early 1900s, Arlington, which was then called &quot;Lost Grove&quot;, was experiencing rapid growth and development. Many companies set up shop to profit from the people flocking to the jobs at the coal mines in this area of Illinois. The businesses included a mattress factory, beer brewery, numerous restaurants, a brothel, and many others. The mayor at the time was from New York, and changed the town&#x27;s name to Arlington, after the town of Arlington, New York. Arlington was about the size of Peru, Illinois.

On November 13, 1909, a fire in a mine shaft killed 259 miners, young and old, at the Cherry coal mine. Authorities sealed the mine to contain the fire, trapping many rescue workers inside. When the mine was opened a week later only twenty men had survived of the hundreds involved. The 1909 Cherry Mine disaster influenced early workers&#x27; compensation laws and labor practices in the coal mining industry. At the time Illinois had no laws governing working conditions for miners. Arlington&#x27;s growth slowed drastically after this occurrence.

In the 1950s a tornado destroyed most of Arlington. Many people moved away from the town at this time. Today Arlington has a population of less than 200. Many of the businesses and most of the homes have been shut down, deserted, or demolished. Many areas previously inhabited are now corn and bean fields. Some of the abandoned homes&#x27; foundations, and evidence of their former occupants, are still visible in these fields.

==History==
DePue, originally called Trenton, was established in 1853. The present name refers to an early French fur trader by the name of De Pue. The site had long been used as a port and ice harvesting center on the Illinois River. In 1905, the Mineral Point Zinc Company started a plant to produce slab zinc for automobile and appliances in DePue, taking advantage of the nearby coalfields and trained labor force of the LaSalle-Peru zinc processing center. The plant was shortly after acquired by New Jersey Zinc and finally closed in 1990.

==Geography==
DePue is located at (41.326112, -89.301184).

According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, De Pue has a total area of , of which (or 92.53%) is land and (or 7.47%) is water.

The average household size was 3.19 and the average family size was 2.92.

The village&#x27;s age distribution consisted of 29.4% under the age of 18, 6.3% from 18 to 24, 26.4% from 25 to 44, 22.9% from 45 to 64, and 15.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35.6 years. For every 100 females, there were 140.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 161.4 males.

==Lake DePue==
The lake and adjacent park feature wildlife and recreation. The American Power Boat Association (APBA) and the DePue Men&#x27;s Club (a social and volunteer organization) host a weekend of boat racing on Lake DePue. The event draws spectators from across the country and brings entertainment and food vendors to the lakeside park. Barack Obama visited when he was an Illinois legislator. In a January 16, 2011, news story featured in the online edition of the Peoria &quot;Journal Star&quot;, Associated Press reporter Tammy Webber reported that the oxbow lake, surrounded by a Superfund site, is polluted by high levels of metals such as zinc, lead, arsenic, cadmium, and chromium because of the smelting activity that takes place there for the automotive and appliance industries, chiefly by New Jersey Zinc and Mobil Chemical. The village is urging Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan to investigate whether the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency, which has oversight over the case, is pushing the companies hard enough. This is important because the town alleges the companies and the IEPA have not done enough to combat the pollution that has made the lake markedly shallower. This phenomenon could, unless rapidly remedied, soon interfere with the small municipality&#x27;s efforts to keep its remaining revenue source for most supplemental projects, the competition. The manufacturing jobs have now entirely disappeared.

In the summer of 2012, as a result of both the summer&#x27;s drought and Lake DePue&#x27;s pollution, the APBA nearly cancelled its National Championship Races due to the shallow water. In a display of community and hard work, DePue&#x27;s citizens built a dam at the mouth of the lake and raised the water by using pumps and the lake&#x27;s springs to the level required for racing in a matter of weeks.

==Education==
One school building hosts all three village schools, the elementary, the junior high, and the DePue High School. The three schools have classes in different wings of the building. The name of the school district is DePue Unit Schools District #103. Extracurricular activities offered for the grade 6-12 students include sports and clubs. DePue Junior High School offers boys and girls basketball, girls&#x27; volleyball, cheerleading, and track. DePue High School offers boys and girls basketball, soccer, girls&#x27; volleyball, cheerleading, and track.

==History==
The settlement was originally named Osgood after the manager of the Whitebreast Fuel Company. The Whitebreast Fuel Company, based in Ottumwa, Iowa was the major coal supplier for the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad. They set up the town in 1888.

The Ladd mine went bankrupt in 1901 and was purchased by the Illinois Third Vein Coal Company, owned by Samuel Dalzell of Spring Valley. At its height, the mine employed over 700 men and took an average of 1200 tons of coal a day from the ground. As a coal mining town, it is ethnically diverse with immigrants from Italy, Ireland, and Poland taking jobs at the mine. The mine closed in 1924.

In 2015 the village celebrated its 125th anniversary. The local grade school was replaced in the summer of 2003; prior to that the grade school occupied the building that originally housed Hall High School until the new school was constructed in 1911 in Spring Valley, at which time the old high school became the new Ladd C.C.

<text>Mineral is a village in Bureau County, Illinois, United States. The population was 206 at the 2020 census, down from 237 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Ottawa Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==Geography==
Mineral is located at (41.381921, -89.836576).

According to the 2021 census gazetteer files, Mineral has a total area of , all land.

==History==
The area in which Mineral is located was first settled in the early 1830s. The land just south of the current village was found to be ripe with coal. Several mines were open until strip mining became a commonly practiced way to retrieve coal from the ground.

The population of the township of Mineral (so named because of its rich coal supply) became populated to the point of where it was officially organized in 1850. As the train tracks were laid north of the coal mining area, so brought the formation of the town of Mineral. The town of Mineral was platted in 1857 and soon developed several small stores and a population of 300 to 350 residents.

A school was erected in 1870, with the town&#x27;s first graduating high school class being the class of 1894, with three students earning their diplomas. The year 1907 brought the completion of the Hennepin Canal to the north of Mineral. The canal&#x27;s practical use was outdated by its completion due to the vast developments in the train industry. The Hennepin Canal continues to function as a fishing and boating area.

In 1919, the Mineral School building was destroyed by fire. The school district was organized and determined to rebuild. In 1922, a new two-story brick school building was built on the northwest side of town. This school was built to handle grades 1 - 12 and included a gymnasium complete with a stage and balcony area. During this time, Mineral continued to grow at a steady pace. Though the town&#x27;s population is said to have never exceeded 350 people, the town was able to support several small businesses, allowing the residents to have all they needed within walking distance of their homes. The creation of U.S. Route 6, which passed through Mineral, was also an asset to the town, bringing in visitors from all over the country.

Mineral enjoyed great successes through the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, continuing to support its own school system and several small businesses including, at one time, three gas stations, three restaurant/taverns, an upholstery store, a motel, two grain elevators, two churches, a lumber yard, two grocery stores, a bank, a volunteer fire department, a library, a barbershop, a beauty shop, an ice cream parlor and Mineral High School.

In 1961, the high school was closed due to a lack of sufficient enrollment. The Mineral School District agreed to an annexation effort into the Annawan School District. The Mineral School building continued to serve as a grade school for the Annawan School District until 1974, when its services as a school were ceased for good.

The creation of I-80 north of Mineral was the second devastating blow to the growth of Mineral in the 1960s. All foreign traffic that previously traveled through town by the hundreds of cars a day, now took the quicker, more efficient route of I-80. One by one the businesses closed in this once bustling community.

Today Mineral still supports a grain elevator, a restaurant/tavern, a library, a new post office, a Methodist Church, a volunteer Fire Department, and a trucking business. The old school building has been razed. A new ethanol plant is being built just two miles west of town and is bringing hope for a resurgence in population for the area.

<text>New Bedford is a village in Bureau County, Illinois, United States. The population was 76 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Ottawa Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

In October 1836, Henry Thomas of West Bureau Township registered land at the narrows (now New Bedford) and for a number of years it was the only registered tract in that section of the county. In the spring of 1837, Cyrus Watson, the first settler on Green river, built a cabin on Thomas&#x27; land, believing it to be vacant. About this time a state road was laid from Princeton to Prophetstown on the Rock River, crossing the Green River at this point. Henry Thomas built a ferry boat, and for a number of years it was known as Thomas&#x27; Ferry.

<text>Princeton is a city in and the county seat of Bureau County, Illinois, United States. The population was 7,832 at the 2020 census.

Princeton is part of the Ottawa Micropolitan Statistical Area. Due to its location where Interstate 80 meets the Amtrak system, as well as its well-preserved main street and historic housing stock, Princeton has become a popular satellite town for Chicago and the Quad Cities.

==History==
Bureau County was a New England settlement. The original founders of Princeton consisted entirely of settlers from New England. These people were &quot;Yankees,&quot; descended from the English Puritans who settled New England in the 1600s. They were part of a wave of New England farmers who headed west into what was then the wilds of the Northwest Territory during the early 1800s. Most of them arrived as a result of the completion of the Erie Canal. When they arrived in what is now Bureau County there was nothing but a virgin forest and wild prairie; the New Englanders laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings and established post routes. They brought with them many of their Yankee New England values, such as a passion for education, fueling the establishment of many schools, as well as staunch support for abolitionism. They were mostly members of the Congregationalist Church though some were Episcopalian.

Culturally Bureau County, like much of northern Illinois, would be culturally very continuous with early New England culture for most of its history. During the time of slavery, it was a stop on the Underground Railroad at the home of Owen Lovejoy.

The name of Princeton was supposedly determined by drawing from a hat:
Princeton&#x27;s former nickname was &quot;The City of Elms&quot; because of the large number of elm trees the city had during the middle of the 20th century. After Dutch elm disease struck in the mid-1960&#x27;s and killed off almost every elm, Princeton&#x27;s slogan was changed to &quot;Where Tradition Meets Progress&quot;.

Now, the slogan is &quot;A Short Drive that Takes you Far.&quot;

==Geography==

It remained in use for 22 years. In 1912 the construction of larger Matson Public Library building was begun. It was located at 15 Park Avenue East. On March 21, 2006, a referendum was passed for the renovation of 698 East Peru Street, formerly known as Bogo&#x27;s, to become Princeton Public Library. Princeton Public Library opened on August 1, 2007, replacing an older facility, the Matson Public Library, and has a book of 45,000 items, with about of usable space.

===Name===
Spring Valley lies in the valley of Spring Creek. The hills on either side of this valley were, and are to some extent today, laced with springs that still feed Spring Creek.

There were numerous springs in the town itself. One in the vicinity of the once Hunter-Doherty Lumber yard was so large and fast-flowing that the indigenous people from that area had an encampment there. Remains of this encampment were visible in the early days of the town. There was a large spring that flowed from the side of the hill between East St. Paul Street and East Devlin Street, down a gully into Spring Creek. Springs still feed the pond of water at the foot of Number One slag dump on East St. Paul Street. This area is now the &quot;Coal Mine Park&quot; owned by Spring Valley PRIDE. The first drinking water supply was piped from large springs on North Sixth Street.

So, with the springs and valleys, it was easy to conceive the name Spring Valley. There is a record that the Indians called this territory, &quot;The Valley of the Springs.&quot;

The fact that Spring Valley is located at the point in the river valley where the high bluffs, which contains the famous stream, are closer together than anywhere else in the grain belt and that there is a minimum flood plain has made this point most attractive for the location of grain elevators. It has become the fulcrum of the grain handling industry of the upper section of the Illinois River.

==History==
===Coal===
Spring Valley was founded in 1884 in the heart of the coal fields of Northern Illinois for the express purpose of mining of coal. The building of Spring Valley was the enterprise of Henry J. Miller, one of the first settlers of this area, and his son-in-law, Charles J. Devlin. Charles Devlin had lived in Peru, Illinois as the manager of the Union Coal Company in LaSalle. They conceived the idea of establishing a coal metropolis, in the Valley and on the slopes of the bluffs bordering Spring Creek, in the southeastern corner of Bureau County. They acquired the mineral rights of and purchased on which to build the town. They secured the financial aid and cooperation of coal and railroad capitalists, E.N. Saunders of St. Paul, Minnesota, a director of the Chicago and North Western railroad, Mr. Taylor of What Cheer, Iowa, and William L. Scott of Erie, Pennsylvania. Scott was a United States Senator from Pennsylvania during the administration of President Grover Cleveland. Most of these men are remembered in the name of the streets of the town.

Two companies were formed, the Spring Valley Coal Company in partnership with Alexander Campbell, and the Spring Valley Town Site Co. Backed by the almost unlimited resources of the coal barons, these two companies spent over $2 million in less than four years in the building of the town.

The boring of the mine commenced in 1884 and the town surveyed and platted. Spring Valley did not grow from a crossroads country store or framehouse, it was planned with the hope it would grow to be a large city. Space was set aside for churches, schools and public buildings and broad streets were laid out. St. Paul Street became one of the widest streets in the state and in 1984 made even wider. In the residential section of the city property line, lies from curb and ample room for expansion.

Spring Valley was a boom town, its growth was so rapid that it was called the &quot;Magic City.&quot; In less than four years, by 1888, the Chicago North Western railroad had laid a line from DeKalb, Illinois, four mines had been sunk and the town had 3,000 people.

===Violent strikes===
There were large-scale violent strikes in the late 1880s. Italian coal miners in the 1890s brought in anarchism, and the violence escalated during the depression of 1893-96. The strikes were failures but the angry miners voted for the Populist ticket in 1894.

In August 1895, Spring Valley experienced the state&#x27;s most destructive race riot to date, out of which came major legislation prohibiting companies from bringing in squads of men to replace existing workers. Tension between mine owners and union agitators led to a lockout in 1889. Many Italian immigrants arrived to cross the picket lines but eventually staged their own strike in 1894, encouraging the industry to bring in African Americans to break the strike. Relations between the races rapidly deteriorated, leading to the riot that ended the use of Black strike breakers. Governor John Peter Altgeld&#x27;s response to the August 4 attack on the black community by displaced Italian miners ultimately revealed his support of fellow immigrants over African Americans. Another riot erupted in 1895 when recent Polish, Lithuanian, Italian, and Belgian immigrants raided, burned, and looted the Black section of town, leaving fourteen Black townspeople injured. Black victims of the riot took their attackers to court and used their status as citizens to win the case against the new immigrants.

Spring Valley remained a brawling, boisterous place until the competition from cheaper Southern Illinois coal fields forced the mine to close in late 1927.

===Ethnicity===
Spring Valley like every other coal town came to know almost every nationality in Europe. These people came from LaSalle, Peru, Braidwood, Braceville and all mining camps of Northern Illinois. The English, Scottish, Irish, Welsh, and Cornish from the Coal fields of Great Britain, from Northern France and Belgium. Polish, and Germans, Swedes and Lithuanians from opposite shores of the Baltic Sea, Slavish peasants from Central Europe and immigrants from sunny Italy. Many arriving here attired in their native dress tagged and ticketed from their port of entry. The town also developed a black section known as the &quot;Location.&quot; In 1905, the Bureau County Republican Newspaper stated that there were 32 distinct nationalities groups in Spring Valley.

===Institutions founded===
By 1888, two years after the incorporation of the town, February 8, 1886, two churches, the Congregational and the Immaculate Conception, had been built, two schools erected, the Immaculate Conception Parochial and the Lincoln Public School, which includes a two-year high school course, a newspaper (the Spring Valley Gazette), and a public library.

This library, an institution for which all towns wait many years, was established by the &quot;Knights of Labor&quot;, the Coal Miner&#x27;s Union in 1885 before the town was a year old, before even a city government was formed. This early interest in education culminated in the establishment of two schools believed to be the first of their kind in the state.

The Hall Township High and Vocational School training in shop, carpentry, printing, drafting, cooking, sewing, typing, shorthand, bookkeeping and banking. This school was constructed in 1914.

==City government==
The city government is aldermanic, with two aldermen to each of four wards, and a mayor, who is elected at large. As of 2024, the aldermen comprising the Spring Valley City Council were as follows:

== History ==

Chadwick is the youngest community in Carroll County and had its beginnings &quot;circa&quot; 1853 when Jacob Isenhart built the first house on the prairie.

In 1866, when the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad extended its line from Aurora to Savanna, no provision was made for town sites, so the St. Paul Land Company was organized to acquire land along the right-of-way. The company decided that which comprised the original town site and belonged to Alexander Snow of Lanark would be an ideal location. The Land Company offered the Snows $100 per acre but Lanark merchants had persuaded the Snows that their land was worth $125; neither party would yield. When the land company started looking elsewhere the farmers in the community raised $1,500, to make up the difference. The land company named the new town Chadwick in honor of one of its officials. The original plot of the town was filed for record on April 12, 1886.

Decreasing population caused a call to incorporate the town. Incorporation papers for Chadwick were approved on September 26, 1882. Following incorporation a village board was elected and a police magistrate and marshal appointed.

The first railroad station was a manure spreader on the south side of the track equipped with the necessary wiring and telegraph instruments for receiving and sending messages on the movement of trains. A new station was built in 1887. Frank Lacy was the first agent but was a telegraph operator only. There were no tickets for sale and passengers paid their fares on the train. The station was enlarged in 1926.

<text>Savanna is a city in Carroll County, Illinois, United States. The population was 2,783 at the 2020 census. Savanna is located along the Mississippi River at the mouth of the Plum River.

==History==

The region was once part of the vast hunting grounds of different native American tribes, including the Sauk. Following the Treaty of St. Louis (1804) and a number of additional treaties, land in Illinois along the Eastern bank of the Mississippi River was opened to settlement by farmers. Towns such as Savanna grew their commerce by using the river for efficient transport. Savanna&#x27;s earliest settlers experienced some repercussions during the Black Hawk War in 1832.

The downtown area has revived since the mid-1990s closing of the army depot with the addition of new ornamental lighting to complement the late 19th century buildings. The city is trying to draw more shops to the main street in hopes of becoming more of a weekend destination, like nearby Galena. Havencrest Castle has also been revived and is a historical art gallery that attracts visitors to the Savanna area.

The Savanna Chamber of Commerce and other community groups sponsor several activities throughout the year that include: the annual Ladies Day Out Luncheon, Savanna Celebrates Independence Day parade and festival, Halloween Parade, the popular Shadfly Festival and a downtown Christmas Walk.

Savanna contains the only stoplight in all of Carroll County.

==Savanna Army Depot==
In 1917, the United States Army purchased of land about seven miles (11 km) north of Savanna to construct the Savanna Army Depot. Originally the land was to be used as a test range for munitions produced at the Rock Island Arsenal in Rock Island, Illinois. In 1921, the mission of the installation was changed to be a depot. From World War II through Vietnam, Savanna Army Depot served as a munitions maintenance and storage facility for traditional, chemical, and nuclear weapons.

By 1995, the Savanna Army Depot was identified by U.S. Congress as one of the bases that would be closed under the Base Realignment and Closure Act or BRAC. On March 18, 2000, the Savanna Army Depot was closed.

The Jo-Carroll Depot Local Redevelopment Authority (LRA) was established in 1997 by an intergovernmental agreement between the Illinois counties of Jo Daviess and Carroll to redevelop the former Savanna Army Depot.

These are some of the many companies that have chosen an area onsite called &quot;Savanna Depot Park&quot; as their home.

* Area 51 LLC, a grain bin operation
* Bryer Productions, a photography business
* Commander’s House at the Savanna Army Depot, owned by A&amp;B Holdings, plans are to make the house a destination for corporate and family retreats

==Infrastructure==
Going from north to south, the second automobile bridge between Iowa and Illinois is located just north of Savanna, and is part of U.S. Route 52. The bridge leads to Sabula, Iowa, which is across the river from Savanna. Savanna is also served by two major railroads, the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (BNSF) Railway Company and the Canadian Pacific Railway (CP). These rail lines were formerly operated by the Burlington Route and the Milwaukee Road respectively. Savanna also has a small airport, the Tri-Township Airport (KSFY).

Savanna is protected by the Savanna Police, Fire Department and Ambulance Service. All three organizations maintain stations on Chicago Avenue. The three organizations were located in the same building (a throwback to when the fire department was responsible for the ambulance) but the original building only houses the fire department and one of the backup centers for Carroll County 911 dispatch. Savanna formerly had its own hospital, but this has since been converted to an assisted living facility, Pinnacle Place. All ambulance patients are transported to Mercy Medical Center in Clinton, Iowa or other Illinois hospitals. The Savanna Ambulance is one of two in the county to have paramedic certified members (a distinction shared with the Mount Carroll Volunteer Ambulance.)

==Notable people==
Savanna has produced many notable natives. These include Helen Scott Hay, an American Red Cross nurse during World War I, &quot;America&#x27;s Waltz King&quot; Wayne King, Hollywood orchestrator Edward B. Powell, professional wrestler Tommy Treichel, Billy Zoom (Tyson Kindell) founding member and original guitarist of the punk band X, MLB player Pete Lister, and former NASA astronaut Dale Gardner.

==History==
===Prison===

The United States Penitentiary, Thomson (formerly Thomson Correctional Center) was opened in 2001, but as of 2009 has never had a prisoner in its main, 1600-bed maximum-security unit; the only prison population has been in the 200-bed minimum-security unit, which was populated in 2006 and averages about 150 prisoners. The minimum security unit has an annual budget of $7 million. State budget constraints, as well as labor union opposition to closing other state prisons, prevented the maximum-security prison from opening.

In 2008, Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich proposed closing the state prison in Pontiac, Illinois and opening the Thomson maximum-security unit instead. However, Blagojevich was subsequently arrested on December 9, 2008, and removed from office. His replacement, Governor Pat Quinn cancelled plans to close the Pontiac prison in March 2009, leaving Thomson unused.

In 2009 the United States government announced that prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp would be moved to the prison in Thomson. CNN stated that before the decision was announced, many people in the town wanted the Guantanamo prisoners to be housed there so the town could get economic benefits.

On December 15, 2009, President Barack Obama ordered the federal government to proceed with acquisition of the underutilized state prison in Thomson to be the new home for a limited number of terror suspects held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The facility was also used as a Bureau of Prisons facility to house other federal inmates. 
In response to the 2009 presidential order, the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), which represents 13,000 Illinois prison staff, argued that rather than turn the maximum-security unit over to the Federal government, it should be used to relieve overcrowding in other Illinois prisons. AFSCME claims that the other facilities were designed for 32,000 prisoners, but currently house 45,000. Subsequent Congressional banning of federal expenditures for imprisoning in the United States of terror suspects held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, stopped the Obama plans regarding those terror suspects, even though the federal government announced on October 2, 2012, that the acquisition of Thomson is going forward.

==Culture==
The processing plant for Schafer Fisheries is located in Thomson. Annually in December, Schafer may process up to 300,000 pounds of fish to support the Polish &quot;Christmas Carp&quot; tradition, and sends these packages both domestically and internationally. The retail store is located in Fulton, IL.

==History==
Beardstown was first settled by Thomas Beard in 1819; he erected a log cabin at the edge of the Illinois River, from which he traded with the local Native Americans and ran a ferry. The town was laid out in 1827 and was incorporated as a city in 1896. During the Black Hawk War in 1832, it was a base of supplies for the Illinois troops.

Thomas Beard&#x27;s son, Edward &quot;Red&quot; Beard, a noted gambler and saloon keeper of the Old West, was killed in a gunfight in Kansas in 1873 by &quot;Rowdy Joe&quot; Lowe. Earlier, he had built a two-story brick building which was used for 85 years as a store and inn. This inn is alleged to have sheltered Abraham Lincoln on his visits to Beardstown, but that is legend and unconfirmed. The building was demolished and replaced by a post office. William Henry Herndon, Lincoln&#x27;s Springfield law partner, claimed that Lincoln contracted syphilis from a prostitute in Beardstown, an incident author Gore Vidal colorfully recounts in his historical novel &quot;Lincoln&quot; (1984).
The Beardstown Courthouse was the site of a famous trial which helped build Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s reputation as a lawyer after he used a copy of a farmer&#x27;s almanac to undermine the credibility of the prosecution&#x27;s key witness. The scene was later depicted in a painting by Norman Rockwell. A Lincoln Museum is on the second floor of the courthouse along with many Native American relics.

==The Beardstown Ladies==

From 1984 to 1993, a group of 16 late-aged women were picking stocks in the Dow Jones and over the course of nine years were claiming returns of 23.4% on their stocks. Once they went public with the amazing returns, they gained national recognition for their success. The Beardstown Ladies, with an average age of 70 (1994), were asked to appear on &quot;The Donahue Show&quot;, CBS&#x27;s &quot;Morning Show&quot;, NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Today Show&quot;, and ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot;. For six straight years they were honored by the National Association of Investors Corp&#x27;s &quot;All-Star Investment Clubs&quot;. In 1993, they produced their first home video for investors called, &quot;The Beardstown Ladies: Cooking Up Profits on Wall Street&quot;. By 1994, they wrote their first book, &quot;The Beardstown Ladies&#x27; Common-Sense Investment Guide&quot;, which sold over 800,000 copies by 1998 and was a &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller. The Beardstown Ladies become a global phenomenon and TV stations from Germany, Brazil, and Japan were interviewing them and taping their monthly meetings in Beardstown. The seeds of scandal were planted in late 1998: a Chicago magazine noticed that the group&#x27;s returns included the fees the women paid every month. Without them, the returns dwindled to just 9%, underperforming the Dow. An article in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; led the ladies to hire an outside auditor, which proved they had indeed misstated their returns. Time magazine jokingly stated that they should be jailed for fraud and misrepresentation. , the Beardstown Ladies were still buying stocks. Their books can be bought from Amazon.com for mere pennies.
