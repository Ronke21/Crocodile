<text>Lake City is a city in and the county seat of Columbia County, Florida, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city&#x27;s population was 12,329, up from 12,046 at the 2010 census. It is the principal city of the Lake City Micropolitan Statistical Area, composed of Columbia County, as well as a principal city of the Gainesville—Lake City, Florida Combined Statistical Area. Lake City is 60 miles west of Jacksonville.

Lake City began as the town of Alligator in 1821 near the Seminole settlement known as Alligator Village. Alligator became the seat of Columbia County in 1832 when it was formed from Duval and Alachua counties. In 1858, Alligator was incorporated and renamed Lake City. The Battle of Olustee, the largest American Civil War battle in Florida, took place near Lake City in 1864. In 1884, the Florida Agricultural College was established in Lake City as a land grant college; it was relocated to Gainesville in 1905 to form part of the University of Florida. The city&#x27;s sesquicentennial was held in 2009.

Lake City is known as &quot;The Gateway to Florida&quot; because it is adjacent to the intersection of Interstate 75 and Interstate 10. The city is the site of Lake City Gateway Airport, formerly known as NAS Lake City. Florida Gateway College is located in Lake City.

==History==

===Timucua and Spanish Florida===

In 1539, Hernando de Soto and his Spanish expedition arrived in Tampa Bay. The de Soto expedition proceeded north from Tampa Bay looking for gold. His expedition met a large Native American group called the northern Utina, possibly near present-day Lake City, who were part of the western Timucua people. Some northern Utina were led by powerful chiefs. In the 17th century Spanish missionaries established missions in this area, west of the site of present-day Lake City. Called Santa Cruz de Tarihica, it was used by the Spanish to develop agriculture and bring Native Americans within their sphere.

===Alligator===

In the 18th century, a Seminole community called Alligator Village (&quot;Alapata Telophka&quot;) occupied this area. Historians do not know when it was established, but its existence was documented by the U.S. Army in 1821. A February 1821 report by Captain John H. Bell mentions that the &quot;mico&quot; (chief) of Alligator Village had recently died and missed a gathering of chiefs. The most famous resident of Alligator Village was Alligator Warrior (&quot;Halpatter Tustenuggee&quot;), also known as Chief Alligator. He was the grandson of Micanopy (King) Payne (&quot;Mekk-Onvpv Pin&quot;) and led Seminole warriors in the Second Seminole War (1835–1842) to resist their people&#x27;s relocation to the Arkansas Territory (now known as Oklahoma).

After Florida became a territory of the United States in 1821, pioneer and immigrant settlers from the United States formed their own settlement adjacent to Alligator Village and called it Alligator. Following the 1823 Treaty of Moultrie Creek, the residents of Alligator village relocated to the banks of Peace Creek in the newly established Seminole reservation, leaving Alligator Town on its own. When Columbia County was formed in 1832 from Duval and Alachua counties, Alligator Town was designated as the seat of the county government.

During the Seminole Wars, several forts were established in the area, including Fort White on the Santa Fe River, and Fort Alligator, also called Fort Lancaster, in present-day downtown Lake City. By 1845, the last of the Seminole left the area of present-day Lake City or were forcibly removed by the US Army. In 1847, Company C of the Florida Volunteers, which was composed of Lake City members, served in the Mexican–American War.

In November 1858, a railroad was completed connecting Jacksonville to Alligator, which opened the town to more commerce and passenger traffic. Alligator Town was incorporated and its name changed to Lake City in 1859; M. Whit Smith was elected as the town&#x27;s first mayor. According to an urban legend, the name was changed because the mayor&#x27;s wife Martha Jane, who had recently moved to the town, refused to hang her lace curtains in a town named Alligator.

===Civil War===

During the American Civil War the railroad between Lake City and Jacksonville was used to send beef and salt to Confederate soldiers. During the summer of 1862, the 8th Florida Infantry Regiment was mustered in at Lake City. The unit was soon deployed to Virginia and fought as part of the Army of Northern Virginia. 

In February 1864, Union troops under Truman Seymour advanced west from Jacksonville. His objective was to disrupt Confederate supplies, and obtain African-American recruits and supplies. Confederate General Joseph Finnegan assembled troops and called for reinforcements from P. G. T. Beauregard in response to the Union threat. On February 11, 1864, Finnegan&#x27;s troops defeated a Union cavalry raid in Lake City. After the Union cavalry was repulsed, Finnegan moved his forces to Olustee Station about ten miles east of Lake City. The Confederate presence at Olustee Station was reinforced to prepare for the Union troops coming from Jacksonville.

Union forces engaged the Confederates at the Battle of Olustee on February 20, 1864, near the Olustee Station. It was the only major battle in Florida during the war. Union casualties were 1,861 men killed, wounded or missing; Confederate casualties were 946 killed, wounded or missing. The Confederate dead were buried in Lake City. In 1928 a memorial for the Battle of Olustee was established in downtown Lake City.

The Civil War badly damaged Florida&#x27;s railroads, including the Florida, Atlantic and Gulf Central Railroad. The railroad was rebuilt by carpetbagger George William Swepson and was renamed the Florida Central Railroad in 1868. In 1869, the Pensacola and Georgia Railroad was merged with a railroad from Jacksonville to Lake City to form the Jacksonville, Pensacola and Mobile Railroad. In 1874, a fire destroyed most of the wooden buildings in Lake City.

===Modern Lake City===

In 1874, Lake City&#x27;s first newspaper was published, called the &quot;Lake City Reporter&quot;. In 1876, the Bigelow Building was completed; it later was adapted for use as the City Hall. In 1891, Lake City became the first city in Florida to have electric lights from a local power and light company.

By the early 20th century, Lake City had become an important railroad junction, served by the Seaboard Air Line, Atlantic Coast Line, Georgia Southern and Florida Railroad. Hotel Blanche was built in 1902 as an attraction for expected tourists. The hotel was Lake City and Columbia County&#x27;s major hotel and central business center from 1902 to 1955.

The population of Lake City in 1900 was 4,013; in 1905 was 6,509; and 1910 was 5,032.

Florida Agricultural College was established in 1884 as part of the Morrill Land Grant Act; in 1904 it became a full university with twenty-five instructors. In 1905 the Florida Agricultural College was moved to Gainesville, becoming part of the University of Florida. Columbia High School constructed a second building in 1906 that was used until 1922.

In 1907, Lake City officials leased the former property of the Florida Agricultural College to the Florida Baptist Convention; they founded a Baptist college called Columbia College. Columbia College lasted for ten years until the college became overwhelmed with debt. Columbia College deeded the land and buildings back to Lake City in 1919. During World War I, the campus of Columbia College was used as a training site for local troops for the war. The facility was adapted for use as U.S. Hospital No. 63, the predecessor of the Veterans Hospital constructed in Lake City. More than 34 Lake City soldiers were killed in World War I.

In 1940, the population of Lake City was 5,836. During World War II, a number of institutions were established to help with the war effort as well as those in Lake City. The Lake Shore Hospital was dedicated in 1940 to provide medical care for those in the Lake City area. The Lake City Woman&#x27;s Club became the United Service Organizations (USO) headquarters to entertain service personnel stationed in Lake City. Naval Air Station Lake City was commissioned in 1942 on the site of the Lake City Flying Club air field. NAS Lake City was a support facility for Naval Air Station Jacksonville and trained pilots to fly the Lockheed Ventura. Military operations at NAS Lake City ended in March 1946, and it was decommissioned as an active naval air station.

After World War II a local air base was converted for use in 1947 as the Columbia Forestry School. The Columbia Forestry School had low enrollments and funds, forcing the school to seek help from the Florida legislature. The University of Florida assumed management of the school, and in 1950 it became the University of Florida Forest Ranger School. As part of the network of community colleges established in Florida, the school became the Lake City Junior College and Forest Ranger School in 1962. Lake City Junior College was renamed to Lake City Community College in 1970; in 2010, it was renamed as Florida Gateway College.

By 1950, the population of Lake City was 7,571. The forestry products industry (turpentine, lumber, and pulpwood) had become a mainstay of the local economy.

During the Korean War, five Lake City soldiers were killed. A monument was dedicated in 1985 in their honor and memory.

In 1958, the Columbia Amateur Radio Society was formed. This was a group of amateur radio operators who enjoyed the ability to communicate all over the world. This radio club still exists today. Lake City&#x27;s centennial was celebrated in 1959 with parades, fireworks, and a 58-page book documenting one hundred years of progress, &quot;A Century in the Sun&quot;. The citizens of the town dressed in period attire, complete with whiskers. A good-natured clash arose between the men with additional facial hair and the women who did not like it.

In 1963, Interstate 75 and Interstate 10 were opened, intersecting at Lake City. In the 1960s, Columbia County schools were not desegregated. In 1970, a judge ordered all Columbia County public schools to integrate. During the Vietnam War, 23 local Lake City soldiers were either killed or M.I.A.

In 1978, the Columbia County Public Library was established. Downtown Lake City was revitalized in the 1990s with new businesses, shops, and restaurants. In 2000, Lake City had a population of 9,980.

On 10 June 2019, Lake City was hit by a cyber ransomware attack that rendered many of the city&#x27;s communication systems inoperable. On 25 June 2019, the City&#x27;s insurance company, the Florida League of Cities, paid 42 bitcoins—over US$480,000—for a mechanism to retrieve the City&#x27;s files and data.

<text>Arcadia is a city and county seat of DeSoto County, Florida, United States. Arcadia&#x27;s Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Its population was 7,420 as of the 2020 census, down from 7,637 at the 2010 census. It is the principal city of the Arcadia, Florida Micropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

According to &quot;The Atlas of Florida&quot;, &quot;The Rev. James Madison (&quot;Boss&quot;) Hendry (1839–1922) named the town in honor of Arcadia Albritton (1861–1932), a daughter of Thomas H. and Fannie (Waldron) Albritton, pioneer settlers. Arcadia had baked him a cake for his birthday, and he appreciated it so much that he named the city after her.&quot;

In 1886, transportation improved in Arcadia when the Florida Southern Railway (later the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad) was built through Arcadia on its way from Bartow to Punta Gorda. The railway caused Arcadia to grow significantly, which led to it becoming incorporated a year later. A second railroad line, the Charlotte Harbor and Northern Railway (later the Seaboard Air Line Railroad), was built through Arcadia from 1907 to 1910 on its way from Mulberry to Boca Grande. Both lines have since been consolidated into a single line by CSX with the Seaboard line surviving north of Arcadia and the Atlantic Coast Line surviving to the south. Arcadia was also served by the short-lived East and West Coast Railway, which connected Arcadia with Bradenton from 1915 to 1934.

During the late 19th century Arcadia was the county seat of what would become many counties. In 1921, legislation enacted called for Arcadia to remain the county seat of DeSoto County and resulted in the creation of the present-day counties of Charlotte, Hardee, Glades and Highlands. Prior to this breakup, Arcadia&#x27;s population had grown considerably, with over 1,000 permanent residents and for ranching.

On Thanksgiving Day in 1905, the town was destroyed by a fire that originated from a midtown livery stable. The fire was exacerbated because the town did not have a working water system or fire department. The estimated monetary damage was $250,000, but no loss of life occurred. Much of the business district was not spared. The town recovered only years later.

Oak Street is the &quot;main street&quot; in Arcadia. The downtown is far more elaborate than neighboring counties&#x27; downtown areas, as Arcadia is older and was their county seat prior to the formation of their present counties. Arcadia is also home to many early 20th-century homes, houses of worship, and several historic public buildings.

From 1917 to 1922, Arcadia was the home of Carlstrom Field, a grass airfield of the U.S. Army Air Service named for deceased aviation pioneer Victor Carlstrom. Carlstrom Field was used for pilot training both during and after World War I. In May 1941, the site again became an airfield for military primary flight training, operated by the Embry–Riddle Aeronautical Institute (now Embry–Riddle Aeronautical University). Carlstrom Field, one of several satellite fields in the Fort Myers area, also trained pilots for the Royal Air Force until its closing in 1945.

Arcadia&#x27;s historic buildings include the Johnson-Smith House, William Oswell Ralls House, and Micajah T. Singleton House. Also, around 3,400 acres, which includes the downtown area, are part of the Arcadia Historic District.

After three Arcadia children, the Ray brothers, were diagnosed with HIV in 1986, school officials refused to let them attend school. The Ray family won a $1.1 million judgement against the county school system, but were forced to leave Arcadia after their home was burned down in 1987.

==Hurricane Charley and the 21st century==
In 2004, Arcadia was heavily damaged by Hurricane Charley, during which the eye went over the city, with winds measured up to at 5:27 pm. The winds were suspected to be stronger outside the city, but cannot be proven due to the lack of equipment outside the city. The city&#x27;s only shelter, the Turner Agri Civic Center, was a shelter made to withstand winds over , but it collapsed during the storm. Everyone evacuated into the hallways and the kitchen of the Turner Center prior to the collapse. The people in the Turner Agri Civic Center were evacuated to DeSoto High School, but soon, part of its roof collapsed. In the center of the town, the Old Opera House&#x27;s roof was peeled off, causing severe water damage. The hurricane severely damaged downtown, especially businesses on Oak Street and Polk Street. Eventually, the Red Cross shelter was forced to evacuate due to the collapsing of the building. The city water tower crumpled along Florida State Road 70 and was never replaced after the hurricane. The city&#x27;s only hospital was heavily damaged, with 35 windows shattering. Part of the roof peeled back, which exposed equipment and patients to the wind-driven rain. This caused an estimated $2.3 million in damages to the hospital. Hurricane Charley caused 3,600 homes to be destroyed or heavily damaged, and displaced 16,000 people. The exact amount of damage is not known, but it was ln the millions of dollars. Two people died in DeSoto County during the storm, and 150 people were injured. Many residents of the town left and never came back. 

After Hurricane Charley, the people in DeSoto High School were taken to the middle school nearby, where at least 75 people spent the night in the middle school&#x27;s gymnasium. The hurricane caused downtown to be heavily damaged. The storm caused 90% of homes in DeSoto County to be damaged and 60% to be uninhabitable or destroyed. The National Guard was deployed to the city and started the cleanup process and enforced a strict curfew in the city. The people of Arcadia came together and started helping each other after the storm, from feeding people to rebuilding. Although during the rebuilding process, the first wave of the Great Recession began, the people of Arcadia were able to rebuild their homes and bring new homes to the city. Downtown Arcadia was rebuilt, but some parts of the county are still damaged from Hurricane Charley. About 12 years were needed to rebuild, but parts of the city and county are still damaged from it. 

In 2017, Hurricane Irma went over the city as a category 1 hurricane. It did not cause a huge amount of damage to the city. Some of the downtown area was damaged, with the Oak Park Inn taking considerable damage, and was not able to open for 4 months after the storm. Parts of DeSoto County were flooded, especially communities on the Peace River. The storm dropped 10-15 in of rain near Morgan Park on the Peace River. The river and its tributaries flooded roadways, homes, and parks. The damage extent is unknown. 

In March 2020, Arcadia declared a local state of emergency in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. DeSoto county has had 10,174 cases of COVID-19.

On September 28, 2022, Hurricane Ian Made Landfall near Cayo Costa. The Hurricane struck as a strong Category 4 Hurricane, near Category 5 strength. The storm would go over the city of Arcadia as a Category 3 Hurricane. The Hurricane would cause major flooding along the Peace River, flooding homes and roads near or on the river. SR-72 collapsed, and buildings and homes in Arcadia would be damaged.

==Geography==

It is leading the state in low fuel prices and has a fly-in and camp facility called Aviation City. Arcadia Municipal Airport hosts an annual Aviation Day event in March. The event consists of a static display of aircraft, biplane rides, helicopter rides, and a skydiving demonstration, but bigger plans are in the works.

==Recreation and events==
Arcadia is located on the Peace River, the major tributary of the Charlotte Harbor estuary. The river offers fine canoeing, shark-tooth hunting, and natural habitats. Tours, recreational accessories, and accommodations are readily available.

Arcadia hosts DeSoto County&#x27;s annual fair usually in the month of January. While traditional aspects of a fair or carnival are provided, the event also presents livestock shows consisting of swine and cattle, which are presented by the local FFA and 4-H.

Arcadia is also the home of three rodeos. These events, which are managed by the local rodeo association, occur during the month of March, the Fourth of July holiday, and in the fall. From the profits of these events many local charities, college scholarships and causes receive funding.

Arcadia is one of the largest groupings of antique dealers in the state, all located conveniently in the downtown area. The local dealers&#x27; association sponsors a &quot;4th Saturday Antique Fair&quot; each month from 8 am to 3 pm, bringing an additional 60 to 120 independent dealers in for the event.

<doc id="109148" wikidata="Q514250" url="?curid=109148" title="Atlantic Beach, Florida">
<text>Atlantic Beach is a city in Duval County, Florida, United States and the second largest of the Jacksonville Beaches communities. When the majority of communities in Duval County consolidated with Jacksonville in 1968, Atlantic Beach, along with Jacksonville Beach, Neptune Beach, and Baldwin, remained quasi-independent. Like the other towns, it maintains its own municipal government, but its residents vote in the Jacksonville mayoral election and have representation on the Jacksonville city council. The population was 13,513 at the 2020 census, up from 12,655 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Jacksonville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

In 1900 Henry Flagler built the Mayport branch of the railroad and erected a station north of where the Adele Grage Cultural Center is currently located. Soon afterward Henry Flagler along with Isaac George built a large hotel called the Continental Hotel on the railroad line between Pablo Beach (Jacksonville Beach) and Mayport. The hotel was a summer resort with 250 guest rooms. There was also a dance pavilion, tennis courts, and a fishing pier. In 1913 the railroad sold most of the land to the Atlantic Beach Corporation which then began paving streets, installing lights, and water and sewer lines. In that same year the Continental Hotel changed its name to the Atlantic Beach Hotel. However, during World War I people were afraid to come to the coast and the Atlantic Beach Corporation went bankrupt. To make matters worse the Atlantic Beach Hotel burned down on September 20, 1919. After the war land began to sell again and the settlement grew. The Town of Atlantic Beach was incorporated in 1926 and the first charter was drafted by Isaac George and adopted in 1929. The first town hall burned down in 1932, so a new one was built later that year. The newly established Mayport Naval Station and the construction of the Mathews Bridge led to the further development of the town. The boundaries of Atlantic Beach were extended in 1987 with the annexation of Seminole Beach, and again in 1996 by extending the westerly boundary to the Intracoastal Waterway.

<text>Baldwin is a town in Duval County, Florida, United States. When the majority of communities in Duval County were consolidated with the city of Jacksonville in 1968, Baldwin, along with Jacksonville Beach, Atlantic Beach and Neptune Beach, remained partly independent. Like the other towns, it maintains its own municipal government, but its residents vote in the Jacksonville mayoral election and vote for the Jacksonville City Council; unlike the others, Baldwin no longer supports its own police force. The population was 1,396 at the 2020 census, down from 1,425 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Jacksonville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
The Town of Baldwin was first settled under the name of Thigpen in 1846. Mr. Thigpen had opened a tavern to benefit the stagecoach line at the crossroads of what is today Baldwin. He supplied horses for the stage and shelter and food for the passengers. The first railroad was built through Thigpen in 1857, with a second crossing it in 1859. The name was changed to Baldwin in honor of Abel Seymour Baldwin, the president of the Florida, Atlantic and Gulf Central Railroad, a railroad that ran from Lake City to Jacksonville. Further development in Baldwin led to the establishment of a telegraphic line running from Jacksonville to Baldwin. Baldwin lies between Macclenny and Jacksonville
During the Civil War, Baldwin was captured by Federal forces early in 1864. Northern troops and correspondents noted that the citizens of Baldwin were &quot;wretchedly poor.&quot;

On August 10, 1864, a skirmish occurred between a Confederate cavalry and the 102nd Regiment United States Colored Troops. A section of railroad track was destroyed by the Union Army troops. Two days later the Federals dispatched cavalry troops from Baldwin to drive Confederate forces back. One Federal soldier was killed and four were captured in the process. Baldwin was then burned down by the Federals. From 1865 to 1875 Baldwin was rebuilt reaching a population of 250.

In 1947, the original school building serving the white population burned to the ground. There was no fire department to control it, and it was completely destroyed. The students from the school were temporarily housed in a variety of public buildings, including churches and the city hall. Later, barracks buildings from nearby army training base Camp Blanding were moved to the site of the burned school, where classes continued for about two years while a new school was being built. A school for the black population was located in a building located near the old ice plant that served the railroad. The school was occupied for a number of years after the new white school was built.

Florida State law, in 1948, required new school buildings be placed on parcels not less than in size. As the property under the existing school was not large enough, a site on Mill Street was chosen. A $50,000 school was erected during the winter and summers of 1948 and 1949. In 1950, an auditorium was completed. At that time the school enrollment was 365. In 1964, a Music Suite was added.

In 1965, Baldwin became the first Duval County school to be integrated.

<text>Jacksonville Beach is a coastal resort city in Duval County, Florida, United States. The population was 23,830 at the 2020 census. The city is part of group of communities collectively referred to as the Jacksonville Beaches on the northern half of San Pablo Island. These communities include Mayport, Atlantic Beach, Neptune Beach, and Ponte Vedra Beach. When the city of Jacksonville consolidated with Duval County in 1968, Jacksonville Beach, together with Atlantic Beach, Neptune Beach, and Baldwin, voted to retain their own municipal governments. As a result, citizens of Jacksonville Beach are also eligible to vote in mayoral election for the City of Jacksonville. It is part of the Jacksonville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
It was incorporated on May 22, 1907, as Pablo Beach, and changed to Jacksonville Beach in 1925.

The area around present-day Jacksonville Beach was first settled by Spanish settlers. Spanish missions were established from Mayport to St. Augustine. Spain ceded Florida to Great Britain by treaty in 1763, only to have Spain regain it again, and then a final time in 1821 to the United States. American river pilots and fishermen came to Hazard, present-day Mayport, and established a port.

===Pablo Beach===

In the late 19th century, developers began to see the potential in Duval County&#x27;s oceanfront as a resort. In 1883 a group of investors formed the Jacksonville and Atlantic Railroad with the intention of developing a resort community that would be connected to Jacksonville by rail. The first settlers were William Edward Scull, a civil engineer and surveyor, and his wife Eleanor Kennedy Scull. They lived in a tent two blocks east of Pablo Historical Park. A second tent was the general store and post office. On August 22, 1884, Mrs. Scull was appointed postmaster. Mail was dispatched by horse and buggy up the beach to Mayport, and from there to Jacksonville by steamer. The Sculls built the first house in 1884 on their tent site. The settlement was named Ruby for their first daughter. On May 13, 1886, the town was renamed Pablo Beach after the San Pablo River. In 1885, the San Pablo Diego Beach Land Co. sold town lots ranging from $50 to $100 each along with lots from $10 to $20 per acre within of the new seaside resort &quot;Pablo Beach&quot;. In September 1892, work on the wagon road to Pablo Beach (Atlantic Boulevard) was begun. The first resort hotel called the Murray Hall Hotel was established in mid 1886 but on August 7, 1890 it was destroyed in a fire. By 1900 the railway company began to have financial difficulties and Henry Flagler took over as part of his Florida East Coast Railway. In late 1900 the railway was changed to standard gauge and was extended to Mayport.

The Spanish–American War broke out in 1898. The 3rd Nebraska arrived July 22, 1898, for training and embarkation. They encamped at Pablo Beach. They were led by three-time presidential candidate, William Jennings Bryan. After flooding in the camp at Pablo Beach the 3rd Nebraska moved to downtown Jacksonville.

===Jacksonville Beach===

The amusement park phase of Jacksonville Beach began in 1905 with The Pavilion which was later expanded and called Little Coney Island. It was a popular tourist attraction that had such entertainment as a dance floor, swim room, bowling alley, and roller skate rinks. An issue with contracting, and constant weathering of its wooden structure aged Little Coney Island, causing it to be torn down in 1925. On June 15, 1925, the name Pablo Beach was changed to Jacksonville Beach. The Shad&#x27;s Pier was created in 1922 by Charles Shad and with help by Martin Williams. Around the same time W. H. Adams, Sr. created the Ocean View Pavilion amusement park on the former site of the Murray Hall Hotel. Adams wanted to create a larger roller coaster than the one at Little Coney Island. His vision resulted in a 93-feet high coaster. The location of the coaster by the beach made it vulnerable to damage and was eventually deemed unsafe. The coaster was then deconstructed to a smaller coaster. The deconstruction of the larger coaster hurt business at the amusement park. By 1949 the Ocean View Pavilion was in decline and then a fire destroyed it a few years later. The only amusement park in Jacksonville Beach today is Adventure Landing. The boardwalk declined in the 1950s due to the crackdown on gambling and games of chance. Driving on the beach was prohibited in 1979.

Pablo Beach made aviation history on February 24, 1921, Lt. Wm. DeVoe Coney, in a transcontinental flight from San Diego, California, landed at Pablo Beach, having made the flight in 22 hours and 17 minutes, beating the old record, set two years earlier, by 3 hours and 32 minutes. Coney&#x27;s record was soon eclipsed on September 5, 1922, by Jimmy Doolittle piloting a De Havilland DH-4 biplane from Pablo Beach to San Diego in an elapsed time of 21 hours and 19 minutes.

In 1968 most residents of Duval County voted to approve consolidation between the county and the City of Jacksonville. Jacksonville Beach, together with Atlantic Beach, Neptune Beach, and the Westside community of Baldwin voted to retain their own municipal governments. As such they are not part of the City of Jacksonville, but receive county-level services from Jacksonville, and vote for Jacksonville&#x27;s mayor and City Council. Judy Van Zant, widow of lead singer of Lynyrd Skynyrd Ronnie Van Zant, and her daughter Melody opened the Freebird Cafe in 1999. Freebird Live, as it later became, was a popular music venue that became a staple for Jacksonville Beach for 16 years until its closure in 2016. In September 1999 Hurricane Floyd destroyed the Jacksonville Beach Pier. Five years later the pier was rebuilt. In October 2016 Hurricane Matthew forced a mandatory evacuation for Jacksonville Beach. Hurricane Matthew came 40 miles off the coast of Jacksonville Beach causing major flooding. The Jacksonville Beach Pier was partially destroyed by Hurricane Matthew.

==Geography==
Jacksonville Beach is located at (30.2946859, -81.3931396).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and (66.61%) is water.

Jacksonville Beach is the largest town in the Jacksonville Beaches community. It is the eastern terminus of U.S. Route 90, which ends at an intersection with State Road A1A three blocks from the Atlantic Ocean.

===Cityscape===

===Architecture===

In general, the architecture of Jacksonville varies in style and is not defined by any one characteristic, and Jacksonville Beach is no exception. Designed by Marsh and Saxelbye, and completed in 1925, Casa Marina Hotel is a Mission style hotel popular in the 1920s when Jacksonville&#x27;s beaches were being developed. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 2, 1993. Constructed in 1947, the American Red Cross Volunteer Life Saving Corps Station is an Art Moderne style lifeguard station designed by local architect Jefferson Davis Powell. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 5, 2014. Jacksonville Beach is also home to a notable collection of Mid-Century modern architecture. Perhaps the most notable of these works are those designed by architect William Morgan.

As such, it has its own city manager, city council, and mayor, but it is subject to county-level governance by Jacksonville. The current mayor is Christine Hoffman who was elected to a four-year term in November 2020.

==Transportation==
Beach Boulevard (US 90) connects Jacksonville Beach to the Southside neighborhood of Jacksonville. It continues westward to downtown Jacksonville, via the Commodore Point Expressway and Hart Bridge. Butler Bouleveard (SR 202) begins in southeast Jacksonville at Philips Highway (US 1) and ends in southern Jacksonville Beach at 3rd Street South (SR A1A). SR A1A is a popular seaside scenic route extending from Fernandina Beach to Key West. In Jacksonville Beach it serves as the main commercial corridor, extending the length of the beachside community.

<text>Neptune Beach is a beachfront city east of Jacksonville in Duval County, Florida, United States. When the majority of Duval County communities consolidated with Jacksonville in 1968, Neptune Beach, along with Jacksonville Beach, Atlantic Beach and Baldwin remained quasi-independent. Like those other municipalities, it maintains its own municipal government but its residents vote in the Jacksonville mayoral election and are represented on the Jacksonville city council. The population was 7,217 at the 2020 census. Neptune Beach is the smallest of the Jacksonville Beaches communities. it is part of the Jacksonville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==

Neptune Beach was originally part of Jacksonville Beach. Through its development, the part of Jacksonville Beach north of 20th Avenue North was sparsely populated, with a brick road (First Street) connecting the more populated southern area with Atlantic Beach. The name &quot;Neptune Beach&quot; originated in 1922 with Dan G. Wheeler, one of the few residents. Wheeler had a home at what is now One Ocean Hotel (now in Atlantic Beach), and had to walk all the way home from Mayport each evening after taking the Florida East Coast Railway train home from work in Jacksonville. A friend who worked for the railroad informed Wheeler that if he had a station, the train would have to stop for him, so Wheeler built his own train station near his home and named it Neptune.

Neptune seceded from Jacksonville Beach and incorporated as its own municipality in 1931, following a tax revolt. The comparatively few residents of the area were largely cut off from Jacksonville Beach city services such as police, fire, garbage collection, and road developments, though they paid taxes in equal share. The first mayor was O. O. McCollum, and the government met in Wheeler&#x27;s old train station until a new town hall was completed in 1935.

<doc id="109154" wikidata="Q932750" url="?curid=109154" title="Century, Florida">
<text>Century is a town in Escambia County, Florida, United States. Per the 2020 census, the population was 1,713, up from 1,698 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Pensacola–Ferry Pass–Brent, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Century was founded in 1901 as a sawmill company town, and named because 1901 was the first year of the 20th century. A post office has been in operation at Century since 1901. It was officially incorporated as the Town of Century in 1945.

==Geography==
The approximate coordinates for the Town of Century is located on the Florida Panhandle at (30.977648, –87.261500).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 3.69%, is water.

Century is located in the western highlands of Florida. This physiographic province of the northern Gulf Coast region is made up of sand, silt, and clay hills. These highlands are deeply incised by creeks and rivers. Century is located on the western edge of the Escambia River floodplain. A small portion of the town (the eastern side) is within the floodplain itself. Most of the community, however, is located above the floodplain on level to gently sloping hillsides.

Century&#x27;s roadway network is highly irregular. It does not conform to the state of Florida&#x27;s section, township and range survey system, for two reasons. The first is because Spanish land grants were issued along the Escambia River in the 16th and 17th centuries. These boundaries established a unique survey system that contorted east-to-west survey boundaries once Florida became a state and a state survey system was adopted, at which time previously existing survey systems were &quot;grandfathered&quot; in. The second reason for an irregular roadway and property boundary system is due to the community originally being built around the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (now the CSX railway). Automobile highways were eventually constructed, and closely paralleled the railway. U.S. Route 29 (US 29), a more modern highway, was constructed and moved many of the commercial operations west of the small original core of the community (now mostly located within the Alger-Sullivan Lumber Company Residential Historic District).

US 29 is used by residents of Escambia County to reach points north. Alabama State Route 113 leads north from the state line to Interstate 65 and provides the area with a route to Montgomery, Birmingham and Atlanta. From a southbound perspective, Century is en route between these major cities and the coastal beaches at Pensacola Beach and Perdido Key in Florida.

Century is the western terminus of State Road 4, which leads east to the communities of Jay, Munson, Baker, and Milligan.

Fresh water supplies are abundant, with water being withdrawn as groundwater from the local sand and gravel aquifer.

In 1970, oil was discovered in the nearby community of Jay. Oil was also discovered near the town of Century, especially to its northeast. Oil became important to the local economy during the last quarter of the 20th century.

Gravel and sand is mined in open pits in and near Century. These natural mineral deposits are essential to supporting the construction industries in nearby Pensacola and Mobile, especially for use as aggregate materials in concrete.

Timber and pulpwood are other valuable natural commodities of the area. Nearby papermills at Cantontment, and Brewton, Alabama, provide a market for cut pulpwood. Timber processing is conducted by another industry about south of Century.

==Climate==
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and generally mild winters. According to the Köppen climate classification, the Town of Century has a humid subtropical climate zone (&quot;Cfa&quot;).

<doc id="109162" wikidata="Q486306" url="?curid=109162" title="Pensacola, Florida">
<text>Pensacola ( ) is a city in the Florida panhandle in the United States. It is the county seat and only city in Escambia County. The population was 54,312 at the 2020 census. It is the principal city of the Pensacola metropolitan area, which had 509,905 residents in the 2020 census.

Pensacola was first settled by the Spanish Empire in 1559, antedating the establishment of St. Augustine by six years, but was abandoned due to a significant hurricane and not re-established until 1698. Pensacola is a seaport on Pensacola Bay, which is protected by the barrier island of Santa Rosa and connects to the Gulf of Mexico. A large United States Naval Air Station, the first in the United States, is located in Pensacola. It is the base of the Blue Angels flight-demonstration team and the National Naval Aviation Museum. The University of West Florida is situated north of the city center.

The area was originally inhabited by Muskogean-speaking peoples. The Pensacola people lived there at the time of European contact, and Creek people frequently visited and traded from present-day southern Alabama and Mississippi and southeast of Louisiana. Spanish explorer Tristán de Luna founded a short-lived settlement in 1559. In 1698, the Spanish established a &quot;presidio&quot; in the area, from which the modern city gradually developed. The area changed hands several times, as European powers competed in North America. During Florida&#x27;s British rule (1763–1781), dilapidated Spanish-built fortifications were repaired and strengthened.

It is nicknamed &quot;the City of Five Flags&quot;, due to the five governments that have ruled it during its history: the flags of Spain (Castile), France, Great Britain, the United States of America, and the Confederate States of America. Other nicknames include &quot;World&#x27;s Whitest Beaches&quot; (due to the white sand of Florida panhandle beaches), &quot;Cradle of Naval Aviation&quot;, &quot;Western Gate to the Sunshine State&quot;, &quot;America&#x27;s First Settlement&quot;, &quot;Emerald Coast&quot;, &quot;Redneck Riviera&quot;, and &quot;P-Cola&quot;.

==History==


===Before European contact===
The original inhabitants of the Pensacola Bay area were Native American peoples. At the time of European contact, a Muskogean-speaking tribe known to the Spanish as the Pensacola, lived in the region. This name was not recorded until 1677, but the tribe appears to be the source of the name &quot;Pensacola&quot; for the bay and thence the city. Creek people, also Muskogean-speaking, came regularly from present-day southern Alabama to trade, so the peoples were part of a broader regional and even continental network of relations.

The best-known Pensacola culture site in terms of archeology is the large Bottle Creek site, located west of Pensacola north of Mobile, Alabama. This site has at least 18 large earthwork mounds, five of which are arranged around a central plaza. Its main occupation was from 1250 to 1550 CE. It was a ceremonial center for the Pensacola people and a gateway to their society. This site would have had easy access by a dugout canoe, the main mode of transportation used by the Pensacola.

===Spanish===

The area&#x27;s written recorded history begins in the 16th century, with documentation by Spanish explorers, who were the first Europeans to reach the area. The expeditions of Pánfilo de Narváez in 1528 and Hernando de Soto in 1539 both visited Pensacola Bay, the latter of which documented the name &quot;Bay of Ochuse&quot;.

In the age of sailing ships, Pensacola was the busiest port on the Gulf of Mexico, having the deepest harbor on the Gulf.
On August 15, 1559, Tristán de Luna y Arellano landed with some 1,500 people on 11 ships from Veracruz, Mexico. The expedition was to establish an outpost, ultimately called &quot;Santa María de Ochuse&quot; by Luna, as a base for Spanish efforts to colonize Santa Elena (present-day Parris Island, South Carolina), but the colony was decimated by a hurricane on September 19, 1559, which killed an unknown number of sailors and colonists, sank six ships, grounded a seventh, and ruined supplies.

The survivors struggled to survive, most moving inland to what is now central Alabama for several months in 1560 before returning to the coast; in 1561, though, the effort was abandoned. Some of the survivors eventually sailed to Santa Elena, but another storm struck there. Survivors made their way to Cuba and finally returned to Pensacola, where the remaining 50 at Pensacola were taken back to Veracruz. The viceroy&#x27;s advisers later concluded that northwest Florida was too dangerous to settle. They ignored it for 137 years.

In the late 17th century, the French began exploring the lower Mississippi River, with the intention of colonizing the region as part of &quot;La Louisiane&quot; or New France in North America. Fearful that Spanish territory would be threatened, the Spanish founded a new settlement in western Florida. In 1698, they established a fortified town near what is now Fort Barrancas, laying the foundation for permanent European-dominated settlement of the modern city of Pensacola. The Spanish built three presidios in Pensacola:
* &quot;Presidio Santa Maria de Galve&quot; (1698–1719): The presidio included fort &quot;San Carlos de Austria&quot; (east of present Fort Barrancas) and a village with church.
* &quot;Presidio Isla de Santa Rosa&quot; (1722–1752): This next presidio was on western Santa Rosa Island near the site of present Fort Pickens, but hurricanes battered the island in 1741 and 1752. The garrison was moved to the mainland.
* &quot;Presidio San Miguel de Panzacola&quot; (1754–1763): The final presidio was built about east of the first presidio; the present-day historic district of downtown Pensacola, named from &quot;Panzacola&quot;, developed around the fort.

During the early years of settlement, a triracial creole society developed. As a fortified trading post, the Spanish had mostly men stationed here. Some married or had unions with Pensacola, Creek, or African women, both slave and free, and their descendants created a mixed-race population of mestizos and mulattos. The Spanish encouraged fugitive slaves from the Southern colonies to come to Florida as a refuge, promising freedom in exchange for conversion to Catholicism. Most went to the area around St. Augustine, but escaped slaves also reached Pensacola.

===British===


After years of settlement, the Spanish ceded Florida to the British in 1763 as a result of an exchange following British victory over both France and Spain in the French and Indian War (the North American theater of the Seven Years&#x27; War), and French cession of its territories in North America. The British designated Pensacola as the capital of their new colony of West Florida. From 1763, the British strengthened defenses around the mainland area of fort San Carlos de Barrancas, building the Royal Navy Redoubt. George Johnstone was appointed as the first British governor, and in 1764, a colonial assembly was established. The structure of the colony was modeled after the existing British colonies in America, as opposed to French Canada, which was based on a different structure. West Florida was invited to send delegates to the First Continental Congress, which was convened to present colonial grievances against the British Parliament to George III, but along with several other colonies, including East Florida, they declined the invitation. Once the American War of Independence had broken out, the colonists remained overwhelmingly loyal to the Crown. In 1778, the Willing Expedition proceeded with a small force down the Mississippi, ransacking estates and plantations, until they were eventually defeated by a local militia. In the wake of this, the area received a small number of British reinforcements.

British military resources were limited and Pensacola ranked fairly low on their list of priorities. So, only small token number of British military forces were ever sent to defend Pensacola. This was in contrast to colonies such as South Carolina, where large numbers of British soldiers were sent. After Spain joined the American Revolution in 1779 on the side of the rebels, Spanish forces captured the city in the 1781 Siege of Pensacola, gaining control of West Florida. After the war, the British officially ceded both West Florida and East Florida to Spain as part of the postwar peace settlement.

In 1785, many Creek from southern Alabama and Georgia came to trade, and Pensacola developed as a major trade center. It was a garrison town, predominantly males in the military or trade. Americans made raids into the area, and settlers pressured the federal government to gain control of this territory.

===United States===
In the final stages of the War of 1812, American troops launched an offensive on Pensacola against the Spanish and British garrisons protecting the city, which surrendered after two days of fighting. Pensacola was conquered again by the US in 1818. In 1819, Spain and the United States negotiated the Adams–Onís Treaty, by which Spain recognized the American control over Florida in exchange of the American recognition of Spanish control over Texas. A Spanish census of 1820 indicated 181 households in the town, with a third being of mixed blood. The people were predominantly French and Spanish Creole. Indians in the area were noted through records, travelers&#x27; accounts, and paintings of the era, including some by George Washington Sully and George Catlin. Creek women were also recorded in marriages to Spanish men, in court records or deeds.

In 1821, with Andrew Jackson as provisional governor, Pensacola became part of the United States. The city was officially incorporated as a municipality in 1822. The Creek continued to interact with European Americans and African Americans, but the dominant Whites increasingly imposed their binary racial classifications: white and black (&quot;colored&quot;, within which were included free people of color, including Indians). However, American Indians and mestizos were identified separately in court and Catholic church records, and as Indians in censuses up until 1840, attesting to their presence in the society. After that, the Creek were not separately identified as Indian, but the people did not disappear. Even after removal of many Seminole to Indian Territory, Indians, often of mixed race, but culturally identifying as Muskogean, lived throughout Florida.

St. Michael&#x27;s Cemetery was established in the 18th century at a location in a south-central part of the city, which developed as the downtown area. Initially owned by the Church of St. Michael, it is now owned and managed by St. Michael&#x27;s Cemetery Foundation of Pensacola, Inc. Preliminary studies indicate that it has over 3,200 marked burials, as well as a large number unmarked.

Tensions between the White community and Indians tended to increase during the removal era. In addition, an increasing proportion of Anglo Americans, who constituted the majority of Whites by 1840, led to a hardening of racial discrimination in the area. Disapproval arose of White men living with women of color, which had previously been accepted. In 1853, the legislature passed a bill prohibiting Indians from living in the state, and provided for capture and removal to Indian Territory.
While the bill excluded mixed-race Indians and those already living in White communities, they went &quot;underground&quot; to escape persecution. No Indians were listed in late 19th- and early 20th-century censuses for Escambia County. People of Indian descent were forced into the White or Black communities by appearance, and officially, in terms of records, &quot;disappeared&quot;. This pattern was repeated in many Southern settlements. Children of White fathers and Indian mothers were not designated as Indian in the late 19th century, whereas children of Blacks or Mulattos were classified within the Black community, related to laws during the slavery years.

Pensacola experienced the Civil War when in 1861, Confederate forces lost the nearby Battle of Santa Rosa Island and federal forces of the United States subsequently failed to win the Battle of Pensacola. After the fall of New Orleans in 1862, the Confederacy abandoned the city and it was occupied by the North. In June, 1861, the Pensacola Guards were mustered in as a company in the 1st Florida Infantry Regiment.

In 1907–1908, 116 Creeks in Pensacola applied for the Eastern Cherokee enrollment, thinking that all Indians were eligible to enroll. Based on Alabama census records, most of these individuals have been found to be descendants of Creeks who had migrated to the Pensacola area from southern Alabama after Indian removal of the 1830s.

In 1908, a citywide streetcar strike occurred in the city, which led to state militia being stationed in the city and martial law being declared.

==Geography==
Pensacola is located on the north side of Pensacola Bay. It is east of Mobile, Alabama, and west of Tallahassee, the capital of Florida. Although the incorporated city limits of Pensacola are relatively small, numerous census-designated places (CDPs) are located immediately outside of the incorporated city limits that are widely considered to be Pensacola. Due to their proximity to the city limits, their mailing addresses are listed as Pensacola, with a lack of independent government services apart from the City of Pensacola and Escambia County. While residents of these CDPs have rejected incorporation into the City of Pensacola in previous referenda, they largely identify as residents of Pensacola. Examples of these CDPs include Goulding, Ferry Pass, Ensley, Bellview, Myrtle Grove, Warrington, and West Pensacola.

Pensacola is located at (30.4213090, -87.2169149).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and (44.62%) is water.

The land is sloped up northward from Pensacola Bay, with most of the city at an elevation above that at which a potential hurricane storm surge could affect.

===Climate===
Weather statistics since the late 20th century have been recorded at the airport. The city has seen single-digit temperatures (below 10 °F) on three occasions: on January 21, 1985; on February 13, 1899; and on January 11, 1982. According to the Köppen climate classification system, Pensacola has a humid subtropical climate, (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), with short, mild winters and hot, humid summers. Typical summer conditions have highs in the lower 90s °F (32–34 °C) and lows in the mid 70s °F (23–24 °C). Afternoon or evening thunderstorms are common during the summer months. Due partly to the coastal location, temperatures above are relatively rare, and last occurred in June 2011, when two of the first four days of the month recorded highs reaching the century mark. 
The highest temperature ever recorded in the city was on July 14, 1980.

In the 1991–2020 climate normals, the daily average temperature in January is . Freezing temperatures occur an average of 11 days per winter, with the average first and last dates for a freeze being December 12 and February 14, giving Pensacola an average growing season of 301 days. However, the relatively recent winter season of 2018-19 did not record a freeze, the median first and last freeze dates are earlier and later than the averages of December 12 and February 14, and the median number of freezes per season is 11 or fewer. 
The mean coldest temperature reached in a given winter season is about , although the median is slightly higher, at no colder than most years, placing Pensacola in USDA zone 9b. Temperatures below are very rare, and last occurred on January 8, 2015, when a low of was seen. The lowest temperature ever recorded in the city was on January 21, 1985.

Snow is rare in Pensacola, but does occasionally fall. The most recent snowfall event occurred January 21, 2025, which produced record-breaking accumulations of up to 9.4 inches within the city limits and near-blizzard conditions. The snow event previous to it occurred on December 9, 2017. The city receives of precipitation per year, with a slightly more rainy season in the summer. The rainiest month is July, with , with May being the driest month at . In June 2012 over one foot (300 mm) of rain fell on Pensacola and adjacent areas, leading to widespread flooding. On April 29, 2014, Pensacola was drenched by at least 20 inches of rain within a 24-hour period, causing the worst flooding in 30 years.

The city suffered a major blow on February 23, 2016, when a large EF3 wedge tornado hit the northwest part of Pensacola, causing major damage and several injuries.

===Hurricanes===
Pensacola&#x27;s location on the Florida Panhandle makes it vulnerable to hurricanes. Hurricanes which have made landfall at or near Pensacola since the late 20th century include Eloise (1975), Frederic (1979), Juan (1985), Erin (1995), Opal (1995), Georges (1998), Ivan (2004), Dennis (2005), and Sally (2020). In July 2005, Hurricane Dennis made landfall just east of the city, sparing it the damage received from Ivan the year before. However, hurricane and near-hurricane-force winds were recorded in downtown, causing moderate damage.

Pensacola received only a glancing blow from Hurricane Katrina in 2005, resulting in light to moderate damage reported in the area. The aftermath of the extensive damage from Katrina was a dramatic reduction in tourism coming from Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.

====Hurricane Ivan====

On September 16, 2004, Pensacola and several surrounding areas were devastated by Hurricane Ivan. Pensacola was on the eastern side of the eyewall, which sent a large storm surge into Escambia Bay; this destroyed most of the I-10 Escambia Bay Bridge. The storm knocked 58 spans off the eastbound and westbound bridges and misaligned another 66 spans, forcing the bridge to close to traffic in both directions. The surge also destroyed the fishing bridge that spanned Pensacola Bay alongside the Phillip Beale Memorial Bridge, locally known as the Three Mile Bridge.

Over $6 billion in damage occurred in the metro area and more than 10,000 homes were destroyed, with another 27,000 heavily damaged. 105,000 households in Northwest Florida were impacted in some way by the storm, and 4,300 businesses in the area permanently closed as a result of Hurricane Ivan. NASA created a comparison image to illustrate the massive damage. This widespread destruction of property caused a temporary lack of affordable housing in the Pensacola real estate market, and Hurricane Dennis and Hurricane Katrina contributed to a general scarcity of construction labor and resources along the Gulf Coast.

====Hurricane Sally====

In September 2020, Pensacola suffered heavy damage by Hurricane Sally. Damages in Escambia County were estimated by local officials at $29 million. Downtown Pensacola was flooded.

===Pelican Drop===
The Pelican Drop was a New Year&#x27;s Eve celebration that took place each year in downtown Pensacola. At the ceremony, an aluminum pelican, the city&#x27;s mascot, was dropped instead of the typical New Year&#x27;s ball. The event included live music and fireworks. From 2008 to 2018, The Pelican Drop was a significant attraction in the area, drawing in crowds of up to 50,000 local residents and visitors, making it one of the largest events of its kind in the Central Time Zone. In 2014, the event was named as one of the top-20 events in the Southeast by the Southeast Tourism Society.

====History====
The First Pelican Drop New Year&#x27;s Celebration took place in 2008. The &quot;Pensacola News Journal&quot; released an article stating that the Pensacola Community Redevelopment Agency was planning a new kind of New Year&#x27;s Eve celebration, to be held at the Plaza Ferdinand VII and broadcast live on WEAR-TV; beginning with the 2017 celebration, events were carried in simulcast on WEAR&#x27;s website. Almost 45,000 people showed up for the event, including residents of Mobile, Alabama (which hosts its own competing drop, a Moon Pie), Milton, Florida, Navarre, Florida, and Destin, Florida.

In December 2019, organizers announced that the Pelican Drop had been canceled due to financial issues and the burden the event had caused on local police and public services. A smaller fireworks display, which does not require the same amount of traffic disruption, would be held, instead.

The pelican was made and designed by Emmett Andrews LLC. Made of polished aluminum and decorated with over 2,000 lights, the bird had a wingspan and is high.

==Government==
The city of Pensacola utilizes a strong mayor-council form of government, which was adopted in 2011 after citizens voted in 2009 to approve a new city charter. An elected mayor serves as the chief executive of the city government, while a seven-member city council serves as the city&#x27;s governing body. A council president is selected by the council from its members, along with a vice president.

City voters approved a charter amendment on June 11, 2013, which eliminated the then-nine member council&#x27;s two at-large seats; one seat was phased out in November 2014, and the other expired in November 2016. Two additional charter amendments were approved on November 4, 2014, which made the position of mayor subject to recall and provided the city council with the authority to hire staff. The current city hall was opened in 1986.

===Politics===
After the Civil War, Pensacola, like the rest of the South, was controlled by Republicans during the Reconstruction era (1865-1877). The Republican government had numerous African American politicians, including several county commissioners, city aldermen, constables, state representatives, and even one African American mayor—Salvador Pons. However, with the 1884 election of native Pensacolian and former Confederate general Edward Perry, a dramatic shift occurred. Perry, a Democrat who actually lost the Escambia County vote during the statewide election, acted to dissolve the Republican city government of Pensacola and in 1885 replaced this government with hand-picked successors, including railroad magnate William D. Chipley. The only African American to remain in city government was George Washington Witherspoon, a pastor with the African Methodist Episcopal Church who was previously a Republican and switched parties to the Democrats. Following Governor Perry&#x27;s dissolution of the Republican government, the city remained Democratic for more than a century after the Civil War with no African Americans serving in an elected capacity for nearly a century.

This changed in 1994, when Republican attorney Joe Scarborough defeated Vince Whibbs, Jr., the son of popular former Democratic mayor Vince Whibbs, in a landslide to represent , which is based in Pensacola. Republicans also swept all of the area&#x27;s seats in the state legislature, the majority of which were held by Democrats. Since then, Republicans have dominated every level of government, although municipal elections are officially nonpartisan.

===Regional representatives===

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Aviation====
Major air traffic in the Pensacola and greater northwest Florida area is handled by Pensacola International Airport. , airlines serving Pensacola International Airport are American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Silver Airways, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, and United Airlines.

====Railroads====
Pensacola was first connected by rail with Montgomery, Alabama, via the Alabama and Florida Railroad, completed in 1861 just before the start of the Civil War. During the war, most of the rails between Pensacola and the Alabama state line were removed to construct other railroad lines urgently needed elsewhere in the Confederacy. The line to Pensacola was not rebuilt until 1868, and was acquired by the Louisville and Nashville Railroad in 1880. In 1882, the Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad was completed from Pensacola to Chattahoochee, Florida, linking Pensacola with the rest of the state. This line was also acquired by the L&amp;N.

By 1928, a number of short lines built northward from Pensacola to Kimbrough, Alabama, were acquired by the Frisco Railroad, giving it access to the port of Pensacola. Some thirty years later, retired Frisco steam engine 1355 was donated to the city and stands in the median of Garden Street, near the site of the now-demolished Frisco passenger station.

Frisco passenger service to Pensacola ended in 1955, and L&amp;N passenger service, including the streamlined &quot;Gulf Wind&quot;, ended in 1971 with the advent of Amtrak. However, from early 1993 through August 2005 Pensacola was served by the tri-weekly Amtrak &quot;Sunset Limited&quot;, but service east of New Orleans to Jacksonville and Orlando was suspended due to damage to the rail line of CSX during Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

In the 21st century, freight service to and from Pensacola is provided by L&amp;N successor CSX as well as Frisco successor Alabama and Gulf Coast Railway, a short line. On June 1, 2019, the newly formed Florida Gulf &amp; Atlantic Railroad, a Class III railroad headquartered in Tallahassee, acquired the CSX main line from Pensacola to Baldwin, Florida, near Jacksonville, becoming the Panhandle&#x27;s only east–west freight hauler. A news report on the new railroad in mid-2019 noted that Amtrak indicated that the Panhandle had a &quot;near-zero chance&quot; of seeing passenger service restored. Pensacola and Tallahassee are the two largest metropolitan areas in Florida without any passenger rail service.

===America&#x27;s Coolest Small Town finalist===
Flagler Beach was a finalist in the 2013 &quot;Budget Travel Magazine&quot; contest for &quot;Coolest Small Town&quot;. The magazine described it by the following:

Twenty miles north of Daytona Beach on A1A, Flagler Beach couldn&#x27;t be more different from its party-hardy neighbor to the south. In fact, the area seems to attract more sea turtles and right whales than spring breakers. And it&#x27;s not hard to see why: This thin strip of a beach town, between the Atlantic Ocean and the Intracoastal Waterway, has remained significantly less developed than its neighbors. The six miles of pristine sand—which boast an orange hue thanks to crushed coquina shells—are only interrupted by one fishing pier. In town, the vibe is laid back and retro, thanks to spots like Grampa&#x27;s Uke Joint, which sells ukuleles, and High Tides at Snack Jack, a 1950s fish shack that attracts surfers with funky dishes like tuna reubens, ahi club sandwiches, and sake Bloody Marys.

===Retirement location===
Flagler Beach was ranked by &quot;Where to Retire&quot; magazine as one of the top retirement destinations in Florida. It was featured in the November–December 2012 issue.

The Florida territory had changing European rulers in the war years between the 1500s and the early 1800s: Spanish, English and American. Mill and plantation artifacts make up the display about the Plantation Period. Personal use items, such as buttons and bottles obtained from area missions, represent the history of individuals in the area. From the Mala Compra Plantation, burned down during the Second Seminole War, the Museum has items from the early 19th-century home of Joseph Hernandez, who was elected as the first Hispanic congressman in the U.S.

The period of the late 1800s and early 1900s are represented by books and exhibits about the area&#x27;s economy: county farming of cabbage and potatoes, timber industry, railroad artifacts, and turpentine camp items. Exhibits also include documents and memorabilia associated with the 20th-century development boom that began in the western portion of Flagler County and was continued oceanside.

<text>Palm Coast is a city in Flagler County, Florida, United States. As of the 2020 United States Census, the population was 89,258, an increase of almost 200% since the 2000 count of 32,832. The population was estimated to be 98,411 as of July 1, 2022. It is the most populous city in Flagler County. Palm Coast is part of the Deltona–Daytona Beach–Ormond Beach, FL metropolitan statistical area.

==History==
In the late 1950s, most of the land that would become Palm Coast consisted of swamp and pine forest, with only a few farms and beach houses as well as a turpentine distillery. Business activity was concentrated along Florida State Road 100. Tourists paid fees to hunt and fish in the area.

Developed by ITT Community Development Corporation (Levitt) in 1969, the original development plan encompassed 48,000 home sites on approximately of the owned by ITT. Paved streets and central water and sewer served all lots developed within the plan. An extensive water management system was designed to replenish the area&#x27;s water table, which includes of freshwater canals and of saltwater canals. On October 29, 1970, ITT built Palm Coast&#x27;s welcome center. This date is now celebrated as Founder&#x27;s Day.

In 1975, the Flagler County Board of County Commissioners established Palm Coast Service District, which included almost . Funds for the district were derived primarily from &quot;ad valorem&quot; taxes and were used to provide fire services, fire hydrants, street lighting, animal control and emergency services.

Florida had its first serious &quot;wildland urban interface&quot; fire in 1985 with the Palm Coast Fire, which burned 131 homes. Research on this fire indicated that the most important factor was the proximity of heavy ground vegetation to the structures. Thirteen years later, fires struck the same Palm Coast subdivision. The 1998 fires were national news because the whole county was ordered to evacuate, and 45,000 people were displaced. Fire suppression organizations responded from 44 states, and Florida hosted the largest aerial suppression operation ever conducted in the United States. Because of the massive effort, only 71 homes were destroyed.

In September 1999, the citizenry of Palm Coast voted by a margin of two to one to incorporate as a council/manager form of government. On December 31, 1999, the City of Palm Coast was officially incorporated. On October 1, 2000, all services were officially transferred from the former Service District to the city of Palm Coast. The five-member City Council is elected at large and serves staggered four-year terms. One member is elected as mayor. The promulgation and adoption of policy are the responsibility of the council and the execution of such policy is the responsibility of the council-appointed city manager. The city hired its first city manager on April 17, 2000.

The city provides a wide range of services including development services, fire services, street construction and maintenance, parks and recreational activities. Palm Coast contracts with the Flagler County Sheriff&#x27;s Office for law enforcement services. , the city has plans under way for a new city hall, a town center, new fire stations, and additional lands for parks. Preservation and protection of environmentally sensitive lands is a key goal of this city as it prepares for the future.

The area around Palm Coast last saw a direct hit from a tropical cyclone in 2004 when Hurricane Charley passed directly over the area. Since 1851 when hurricane tracking data began, 33 hurricanes and tropical storms have directly affected the area.

Palm Coast has become a bedroom community for St. Augustine, to the north, and Daytona Beach, to the south, while some residents also work in Orlando and Jacksonville.

<text>Apalachicola ( ) is a city and the county seat of Franklin County, Florida, United States, on the shore of Apalachicola Bay, an inlet of the Gulf of Mexico. The population was 2,341 at the 2020 census.

==History==

The Apalachicola Province, after whom the river and, ultimately the city, are named, was located along the lower part of the Chattahoochee River in Alabama and Georgia in the 17th century, when the Spanish included the Chattahoochee as part of the Apalachicola River. The name is a combination of the Hitchiti words &quot;apalahchi&quot;, meaning &quot;on the other side&quot;, and &quot;okli&quot;, meaning &quot;people&quot;. In original reference to the settlement, it probably meant &quot;people on the other side of the river&quot;.

Between the years 1513 and 1763, the area that now includes the city of Apalachicola was under Spanish jurisdiction as part of Spanish Florida. While the Spanish established missions with the Apalachee people to the northeast of the city of Apalachicola (centered around Tallahassee), and with the Chatot people to the north in the upper Apalachicola River valley and the Chipola River valley, the Spanish did not establish any missions in the area of the lower Apalachicola River during the duration of Spain&#x27;s first occupation of Florida. The earliest-known settlement by non-indigenous people was in 1705, when the Spanish built a fort in the area. In the 1750s, during the French and Indian War, the British captured the Spanish colony of Cuba; however, because Cuba was a prized possession for the Spanish, and Florida was mostly unused backwater, the Spanish traded Florida to the British in return for regaining Cuba. Between the years 1763 and 1783, the area that is now Apalachicola fell under the jurisdiction of British West Florida. A British trading post called &quot;Cottonton&quot; was founded at this site on the mouth of the Apalachicola River. In 1783, British West Florida was transferred to Spain; however, the trading post (and its British inhabitants) remained and continued facilitating trade along the Apalachicola River (which was connected to the trading network along the Chattahoochee River). Gradually, after acquisition by the United States and related development in Alabama and Georgia, it attracted more permanent European-American residents. In 1827, the town was incorporated as &quot;West Point&quot;. Apalachicola received its current name in 1831, by an act of the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida.

Trinity Episcopal Church was incorporated by an act of the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida on February 11, 1837. The building was one of the earliest prefabricated buildings in the United States. The framework was shipped by schooner from New York City and assembled in Apalachicola with wooden pegs.

In 1837, a newspaper at Apalachicola boasted that the town&#x27;s business street along the waterfront &quot;had of continuous brick stores, three stories high, deep, and all equipped with granite pillars.&quot;

Botanist Alvan Wentworth Chapman settled in Apalachicola in 1847. In 1860, he published his major work, &quot;Flora of the Southern United States&quot;. An elementary school was later named in his honor.

On April 3, 1862, during the American Civil War, the gunboat and the steamer (relieving the ) captured Apalachicola. Union forces that occupied west Florida during much of the war moved here.

In 1849, Apalachicola physician John Gorrie discovered the cold-air process of refrigeration and patented an ice machine in 1850. He had experimented to find ways to lower the body temperature of fever patients. His patent laid the groundwork for development of modern refrigeration and air conditioning, making Florida and the South more livable year-round. The city has a monument to him, and a replica of his ice machine is on display in the John Gorrie Museum. The John Gorrie Memorial Bridge, carrying the main road out of Apalachicola, U.S. 98, is named for him.

Before railroads reached the region in the later 19th century, Apalachicola was the third-busiest port on the Gulf of Mexico (behind New Orleans and Mobile). Scheduled boats transported passengers and goods up and down the Apalachicola, Chattahoochee, and Flint rivers to Albany and Columbus, Georgia. A paddle steamer, the &quot;Crescent City&quot;, made a daily round trip to Carrabelle, carrying the mail as well as passengers and freight.

The AN Railway, formerly the Apalachicola Northern Railroad, serves the city.

Originally built in 1935 and rebuilt in 1988, the John Gorrie Memorial Bridge carries U.S. 98 across Apalachicola Bay to Eastpoint.

==Economy==
Apalachicola is still the home port for a variety of seafood workers, including recreational fishing and shrimpers. More than 90% of Florida&#x27;s oyster production was harvested from Apalachicola Bay in past years. Today the oyster industry has completely collapsed due to pollution and lack of water flow in the Apalachicola River. Every year the town hosts the Florida Seafood Festival. The bay is well protected by St. Vincent Island, Flag Island, Sand Island, St. George Island, and Cape St. George Island.
In 1979, Exxon relocated their experimental subsea production system from offshore Louisiana to a permitted artificial reef site off Apalachicola. This was the first effort to turn an oil platform into an artificial reef.

==Arts and culture==

===World&#x27;s Smallest Police Station===

Carrabelle is the home of the &quot;World&#x27;s Smallest Police Station&quot;, which came into being on March 10, 1963. The city had been having problems with tourists making unauthorized long-distance phone calls on its police phone. The phone was located in a call box that was bolted to a building at the corner of U.S. 98 and Tallahassee Street. Johnnie Mirabella, St. Joe Telephone&#x27;s lone Carrabelle employee at the time, first tried moving the call box to another building, but the illegal calls continued.

Mirabella noticed that the policeman would get drenched while answering phone calls when it was raining. So when the telephone company decided to replace its worn-out phone booth in front of Burda&#x27;s Pharmacy, he decided to solve both problems at once by putting the police phone in the old booth.

With the help of Curly Messer, who was a deputy sheriff at the time, Mirabella moved the phone booth to its current site on U.S. 98. The booth did protect the officers from the elements, but some people still sneaked into it to make long-distance calls. Eventually the dial was removed from the phone, making it impossible for tourists to make calls.

It has been featured on television shows &quot;Real People&quot;, &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot;, &quot;The Today Show&quot;, and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. It was featured in the movie &quot;Tate&#x27;s Hell&quot;, which was produced at Florida State University. Along with police station T-shirts—the design is copyrighted—there are police station hats, visors, postcards, and calendars.

But life has not always been easy for the retired St. Joseph Telephone and Telegraph Company phone booth. Vandals have ripped phones out of the booth and shot holes through the glass. It has been knocked over by a pickup truck, a tourist once asked a gas station attendant to help him load it into his vehicle to take it back to Tennessee, and it was knocked over and damaged by Hurricane Kate. Today a replica still stands on the original spot along US Highway 98 in downtown Carrabelle. The original World&#x27;s Smallest Police Station is safely housed and on display at the Carrabelle History Museum at 106 SE Avenue B, Carrabelle, FL.

===Museums===

Carrabelle has a local history museum, the Carrabelle History Museum, which is located at 106 SE Avenue B, in the historic Marvin Justiss building, also known as &quot;Old City Hall&quot;. The museum is free and open on Wednesday and Sunday from 12 pm to 5 pm and on Thursday, Friday and Saturday from 10 am to 5 pm and by appointment other days, for visitors interested in learning about the history and culture of Carrabelle and the surrounding area.
The Camp Gordon Johnston World War II Museum is located at 1873 Highway 98 West, across the street from Carrabelle Public Beach, and admission is free. The museum was named after Colonel Gordon Johnston, an American soldier who served in the Spanish–American War, Philippine–American War and World War I.

Crooked River Lighthouse, constructed in 1895, is located west of town, just past the Carrabelle Beach RV Park. It is the tallest lighthouse on the Forgotten Coast, standing 103 feet tall. The Carrabelle Lighthouse Association manages the Keeper&#x27;s House Museum and a gift shop.

==Education==

The Gadsden County School District operates Havana Magnet School, which serves elementary and middle school grades. Gadsden County High School (formerly East Gadsden High School), outside of the city limits, is the only zoned high school in the county.

Previously the Havana area had three schools: Havana Elementary School, Havana Middle School, and Havana Northside High School. Havana Elementary began using the Accelerated School program in Spring 1995 in order to improve academic performance. In 2001, Havana Elementary, which occupied an area, had about 100 employees and 1,000 students; most of the students were low income, and 95% of the students were from African-American families. In 2003, Havana Northside High School and James A. Shanks High School in Quincy consolidated into East Gadsden High. In 2017, the high school section of West Gadsden High School consolidated into East Gadsden High, leaving the latter as the only remaining zoned high school in the county.
Two private schools are in unincorporated areas and with Havana postal addresses:
* Robert F. Munroe Day School
* Tallavanna Christian School

==Transportation==
The Gadsden Connector, a bus route operated by Big Bend Transit, has a stop in Havana.

<text>Quincy is a city in and the county seat of Gadsden County, Florida, United States. Quincy is part of the Tallahassee, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 7,970 as of the 2020 census, almost even from 7,972 at the 2010 census.

==History==
===Early Florida Statehood and Antebellum Years===

Established in 1828, Quincy is the county seat of Gadsden County, and was named for John Quincy Adams. It is located northwest of Tallahassee, the state capital. Quincy&#x27;s economy was based on agriculture, including farming tomatoes, tobacco, mushrooms, soybeans and other crops.

According to &quot;The Floridian&quot; newspaper, in 1840 there were two schools in Quincy, the Quincy Male Academy and the Quincy Female Academy. Joshua Knowles published the &quot;Quincy Sentinel&quot; in Quincy from November 1839 until it relocated to Tallahassee and became the &quot;Florida Sentinel&quot; in 1841. The paper began publishing in Tallahassee in February or March 1841 as a successor to Quincy Sentinel.

===American Civil War===
One of the most important anti-secession organizations in Florida leading up to the Civil War was the Constitutional Union Party. The party, while acknowledging the &quot;wrongs&quot; inflicted upon the south by the north, advocated for &quot;pacific, rational, and judicial methods for righting these wrongs.&quot; The party held its state convention in Quincy on June 27, 1860. 
William Tennent Stockton, once mayor of Quincy, raised a cavalry company following secession called the Gadsden Dragoons. He was subsequently appointed as captain of the 1st Florida Cavalry Regiment.

Florida was a major contributor of beef, salt, and other supplies to the Confederacy. To facilitate the supply chain, the state was divided into five commissary districts under the overall command of Major Pleasant W. White of Quincy.

===Tobacco===
In 1828, Governor William P. Duval introduced Cuban tobacco to the territory of Florida. As a result, the culture of shade-grown cigar wrapper tobacco was a dominant factor in the social and economic development of Gadsden County. Tobacco is a native plant of the western hemisphere. Early European explorers discovered Native Americans growing the plant when they set foot on their soil.

In 1829, John Smith migrated to Gadsden County in covered wagons with his family and four related families. Since there was already a resident named John Smith in the community, he became known as John &quot;Virginia&quot; Smith. When Smith ventured southward he brought with him a type of tobacco seed which was used for chewing and pipe smoking. He planted that seed and found that the plants grew vigorously. Because there was no market for tobacco in small quantities, it was twisted together, cured and shared with his friends. He purchased some Cuban tobacco seed and planted them with his Virginia tobacco. Several years passed and the two tobaccos blended.

When the Virginia tobacco was grown in Florida soil, it was much thinner and lighter in color. Smith began saving the seed from the hybridized stalks. From these seeds, a new plant known as &quot;Florida Wrapper&quot; was developed. So began a tobacco industry at a time when the South was suffering from the low price of cotton.

Growing tobacco continued to be profitable until the beginning of the Civil War in 1861, even when the European markets were no longer available. Of course, during the war and the Reconstruction Era, very little tobacco was grown except for personal use. Those days were tremendously difficult, and recovery was a slow process. The post-war search for a money crop led to the resurgence of the tobacco culture. Through these experiments it was discovered that tobacco which was light in color and silky in texture demanded the highest prices. With more experimentation, shading the plants began. At first, wood slats were used, but these proved too heavy. Then they tried slats draped with cheesecloth to keep the plants from the light. Next came ribbed cheesecloth. Ultimately in 1950, the white cheesecloth was replaced with a treated, longer lasting, yellow cloth that provided perfect shade.

Colonel Henry DuVal, president of the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad, shipped samples of Gadsden County tobacco to New York for leaf dealers and cigar manufacturers to inspect. Soon representatives of several companies came down from New York to purchase land for growing tobacco. There was such an influx of land purchases that a number of packing houses arose. This continued until 1970 when tobacco companies came under fire and demand diminished. Around 1970, growing tobacco declined substantially in Gadsden. The development of a homogenized cigar wrapper, the ever-increasing cost of production, the subsidizing of the tobacco culture in Central America by the U.S. government, and the increasing, negative legal climate against the tobacco industry have added to the demise of Gadsden&#x27;s future in tobacco. The last crop of shade-grown cigar wrapper tobacco was grown in 1977.

Quincy then turned to its other crops, tomato, mushroom and egg farms. This continued until the close of Quincy&#x27;s mushroom factory and massive layoff of workers at Quincy&#x27;s tomato farm in 2008. Quincy now turns to its businesses and is attempting to build itself into a business-based district.

===Race relations===
Quincy was home to Dunbar High School. It also had a Knights of Pythias of North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia Lodge that was attacked, burned, and members murdered by the Ku Klux Klan reportedly because members were required to pay poll taxes and register to vote.

====Lynchings====
In 1929, Will Larkins was accused of an attack on a white 13 year old Quincy school girl, for which he was quickly indicted. As Larkins was being transferred he was taken by a mob of 40 masked men from Sheriff Gregory of Gadsden county, near Madison and Live Oak. When he was kidnapped by the mob he was being taken to the Duval county jail in a series of moves that newspapers claimed were for his safe keeping. After his capture by the mob Larkins was carried back to Quincy, near the railroad grade crossing, shot to death and hanged with wire, his body was then dragged through the street tied to an automobile and burned at the area where the mob thought the accused committed his crime. Though Governor Carlton promised an inquiry and investigators were put on the case in late 1929, no mention of Will Larkins, except for the NAACP lynching lists of 1929, is made again in newspapers of the time. Larkins was the third man lynched in Florida that year.

In 1941, A. C. Williams was accused of robbery and the attempted rape of a 12-year-old white girl. The account of the details makes the accusation very improbable, but Williams did not live long enough to be tried for the crime. He was kidnapped from jail by a group of white men, and although they both shot him and hanged him, Williams survived. After learning he was alive, the sheriff formed a search party. His family was aware the sheriff had been involved in the lynching, and hid him. Williams needed medical attention and since the hospitals in the Quincy area would not treat a black person, he needed to be transported to Florida A&amp;M University in Tallahassee. The following day a group of masked men kidnapped him from the ambulance and killed him. His body was dumped on his mother&#x27;s porch.

====Resistance to Jim Crow====
In the 1920s, blacks in Quincy including A. I. Dixie repeatedly tried to form political organizations and vote, and protest brutal labor conditions, but were suppressed by violence from whites. Dixie was flogged repeatedly for his efforts. Later, in 1964, Dixie hosted Congress of Racial Equality student activists, while his daughter Linda organized a sit-in, and Jewell Dixie became the first African American to run for Gadsden County Sheriff.

===All American City===
In 1996, Quincy was recognized as an All American City.

==Coca-Cola==

Quincy investors were largely responsible for the development of its local Coca-Cola company into a worldwide conglomerate. Quincy was once rumored to be home to many millionaires due to the Coca-Cola boom. Mark Welch “Mr Pat” Munroe, a local banker, father of 18 children by two wives, and W.C. Bradley were among the stockholders of three of the banks that released 500,000 shares of new Coca-Cola common stock. They urged widows and farmers to invest for $40 each, and several did. Eventually that stock split, and made as many as 67 accounted-for investors and Gadsden County residents rich. A single share of Coca-Cola stock bought in 1919 for $40 would be worth $6.4 million today, if all dividends had been reinvested.

<text>Trenton is a city in and the county seat of Gilchrist County, Florida, United States. The population was 2,015 as of the 2020 census, up from 1,999 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Gainesville, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
===Prehistory===
The first Paleo-Indians reached the north-central Florida area near the end of the last ice age, as they followed big game south. As the ice melted and sea levels rose, these Native Americans ended up staying and thrived on the peninsula for thousands of years. By the time the first Spanish conquistadors arrived, there were over 250,000 Native Americans living on the peninsula. The Timucua were a historic tribe across the north central area of Florida, where Trenton later developed.

Within 150 years, the majority of the pre-Columbian Native American peoples of Florida died of new infectious diseases or warfare, with their societies disrupted. Some were enslaved by the Spaniards, and died because of harsh treatment. Little is left of these first Native American cultures in Trenton except for scant archaeological records, including a few personal artifacts. By the early 19th century, the remnants of these tribes merged with the Muscogee (also known as Creek) who migrated from Georgia and Alabama. They created a new culture through ethnogenesis and became known as the Seminole people. Most of the Seminole were removed from north-central Florida by the United States after wars from the 1830s to 1842, while some resisted by moving south into the Everglades and survived.

===Post-Reconstruction to present===
When the area was being settled in 1883, it was very briefly called &quot;&quot;Joppa&quot; before being named &quot;Trenton&quot;&quot; by a former Confederate soldier who resided in the community but was originally from Trenton, Tennessee (which in turn took their city&#x27;s name from Trenton, New Jersey, after William Trent). The municipality was officially incorporated as the City of Trenton in 1911.

Western Alachua County was developed largely for farms and timber, which sometimes attracted itinerant workers. Trenton developed as a trading and market town for this area, with some professionals who worked here in the early 20th century.

On July 21, 1915, Dr. H.M. Owens was lynched by a mob in Trenton after being told to leave town. He was at the house of Mrs. McGuire, which the mob set on fire after the doctor exchanged fire with the crowd. The doctor was shot to death as he fled the burning house. Dr. Owens&#x27;s local Masonic Lodge was disbanded in the ensuing scandal and only reopened in the 1950s.

At the time, the city of Trenton was still located in Alachua County, which had the sixth highest number of lynchings of counties in Florida.

Trenton is in a rural area, and is the hometown of country music singer Easton Corbin and MLB player, Wyatt Langford of the Texas Rangers. 

===2018 Shooting===
On Thursday, April 19, 2018, two Gilchrist County Sheriff&#x27;s deputies were attacked and slain by a lone gunman while on duty, eating lunch at a local restaurant. The two deputies were identified by Sheriff Bobby Schultz as Sergeant Noel Ramirez and Deputy Taylor Lindsey. The killer, identified as Gilchrist County resident John Hubert Highnote, was found outside the restaurant in his vehicle, where he had committed suicide. The investigation into any possible motive was inconclusive.

<doc id="109184" wikidata="Q580316" url="?curid=109184" title="Moore Haven, Florida">
<text>Moore Haven is a city in, and the county seat of, Glades County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Florida Heartland region. The population was 1,566 at the 2020 census, down from 1,680 at the 2010 census. Moore Haven is located on the southwest shoreline of Lake Okeechobee. It is part of the Clewiston, Florida Micropolitan Statistical Area (μSA).

==History==

The City of Moore Haven was named after James A. Moore (1861-1929), its founder. In its early days, Moore Haven was often called &quot;Little Chicago&quot;, reflecting its status as a significant boom town. It was ideally located at the apex of Lake Okeechobee and the Caloosahatchee Canal.

=== First Woman Mayor of the South ===
In 1917, Marian Newhall Horwitz was elected as, not only the first woman mayor of Moore Haven, or the first woman mayor in Florida, she was additionally, the first female mayor south of the Mason-Dixon line.

Horwitz was described by the &quot;Moore Haven Times&quot;, in a July 27, 1917 issue, as being &quot;business from head to foot&quot; along with being seen regularly at 5:15 am riding horseback to work. She resigned on June 22, 1918, taking over management of the Desoto Land Company after her second husband, John J. O&#x27;Brien, left to serve in World War I, and after her decision to live on the farm, outside the city limits.

After stepping down as mayor, a &quot;grateful citizenry&quot; gave her a silver trophy, which was eventually passed to her son, Dr. Orville Horwitz, as of 1985.

===Railroad===

Horwitz is credited with bringing the railroad to Moore Haven, while her brother was a business associate of J.P. Morgan, the vice-president of the Atlantic Coastline Railroad.

In 1918, construction of the first extension line was finished, bringing Moore Haven&#x27;s first train on May 13, 1918. The twenty passengers and fifteen freight cars arrived ninety minutes late. &quot;Late arrivals, unannounced schedule changes, and faulty equipment, as well as derailments, were to plague the railroad from the start.&quot; The train was often called the &quot;Hinky Dink&quot; and the &quot;Muck Special.&quot; In addition to nicknames, a well-known joke about the train circulated, too, &quot;a middle-aged man, who got off the train at Moore Haven, had left Haines City, as a young boy, in the care of the conductor.&quot;

===Impact of Hurricanes===

The Great Miami Hurricane of 1926 dramatically altered the landscape of the area. The storm surge from the lake caused widespread death and destruction, sometimes literally relocating houses to the opposite side of the river. The town might have recovered, but it was hit not long after by the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane. This decimated areas that had escaped damage in 1926.

Today, Moore Haven is a small, sleepy town that has little industry and infrastructure. Moore Haven is home to the Annual Chalo Nitka Festival, which is held the first weekend in March.

There are two access points to the Lake Okeechobee Scenic Trail, which passes through the town and around Lake Okeechobee.

Built in 2000 and crossing across the Caloosahatchee River 900 feet east of First Street, the Mamie Langdale Memorial Bridge breaks the Florida record of being the Longest Concrete I Girder Span, measuring 320 feet. The overall total length of the Prestressed Stringer/Multi-beam bridge equals 2,281 feet.

The Westergaard House, built in 1920, located on 270 Avenue L Southwest, is the headquarters of the Glades County Historical Society.

<text>Port St. Joe is a city and the county seat of Gulf County, Florida, United States. It is located at the intersection of U.S. Highway 98 and State Road 71. As of the 2020 census, the population was 3,357.

==History==

St. Joseph was founded in 1835 by businessmen from nearby Apalachicola, which was troubled by legal conflict over land titles. It was mostly abandoned in 1841, after a yellow fever epidemic; a storm surge produced by a hurricane in 1844 destroyed what structures remained.

During the Civil War, Florida was a leading producer of salt for the Confederate army. On September 15, 1862, a Union army officer on board the USS Kingfisher wrote that he and his men had sent a demand to the extensive salt works at Saint Joseph that they cease production. When the work was not halted, the Kingfisher went into Saint Joseph bay, sent at least 50 men inland, and destroyed the salt works.

In the early 20th century, a new settlement was founded close to the original after the arrival of the Apalachicola Northern Railroad in 1909. It appears that the more informal &quot;Port St. Joe&quot; was adopted for official use around this time.

The community was extensively damaged by Hurricane Michael on October 10, 2018.

This honey is produced by placing beehives, known by the beekeepers as &quot;Bee Boxes&quot;, in the swamps along the Apalachicola and other area rivers. In some areas the bees are placed on platforms and rafts to keep them above potential floods. Prior to the tupelo bloom, all earlier season honeys are stripped from the bees to avoid contamination with lesser grades produced earlier. Likewise, as soon as bloom is finished, the honey must be removed quickly before the bees have a chance to add other types of nectar.
Wewahitchka has a two-day Tupelo Honey festival each May.

<text>Jasper is a city and the county seat of Hamilton County, Florida, United States. The population was 3,621 at the 2020 census.

The Old Hamilton County Jail and the First United Methodist Church in Jasper are on the National Register of Historic Places. One of the largest industries is phosphate mining.

==History==

Jasper is believed to rest on land originally thought to be the site of the Miccosukee (Mikasukis) people, a subtribe of the Seminole nation. The 1823 Treaty of Moultrie bought the Native American lands, and the population was required to move southeast of the Suwannee River. This allowed white settlers to move into the area. A suspected Native burial mound is located at Baisden Swamp (named after Josiah Baisden) just on the outskirts of Jasper. Six miles north of Jasper along the Alapaha River an established Native village called Halata-Micco (Hala-at-a-Mico) (named for Chief Billy Bowlegs of the Seminole, who may have resided there) once stood. Chief Bowlegs signed the 1832 Treaty of Paynes Landing at Hola-at-a-Mico, his &quot;X&quot; mark (aka Billy Bowlegs) establishing the type of Native inhabiting the area where artifacts of pottery, fishing spear points, and arrowheads are often found.

Soon after the Treaty of Moultrie in 1823 was delivered, Hamilton County was established as part of the original 15 counties in Florida. White settlers mostly from Georgia and South Carolina moved into the area in earnest between 1827 through the 1840s. In 1840, the inhabitants were calling the settlement &quot;Pulaski&quot;; others called it &quot;Wall&quot;. Daniel Bell, living just outside the settlement in 1824, was county judge in 1828, appointed under the authority of the Acting Territorial Governor McCarty in Tallahassee. In 1839, he was a member of the Territorial Legislative Council. Legend has it that Bell, also considered to be the first settler of the county, disagreed with the names that were coming into use for places in the area. He met with locals (one of them named Simon Whitehurst, one of the few Revolutionary War veterans in Florida, buried in Jasper) and other friends, and decided to submit the name of &quot;Jasper&quot;, in honor of Revolutionary War veteran William Jasper, to the territorial capitol in Tallahassee. There the name was registered and incorporated as documented in the Territorial Legislative Journal. In 1841, the Jasper Post Office was established, ending any discussion on names for the town. Florida became a state in 1845, and thirteen years later on March 2, 1858, the town&#x27;s leaders incorporated the town of Jasper.

The early history and specific makeup of Jasper is rather vague except for scant records that survived several courthouse fires in the late 1800s. What we do know is that the original town was built about a mile south of its current location, near the site of the present day Hamilton Correctional Institution. The original courthouse and a stockade stood where Evergreen Cemetery is located. The citizens fought Seminole raiding parties throughout the early periods, the last Seminole War ending in 1858. In 1861, the Civil War came to Jasper. The Jasper Blues (&quot;I&quot; Company 2nd Infantry CSA) was created from Jasper and county citizens. The unit rendezvoused west of Jacksonville and were shipped by train to Virginia, arriving on the day of the First Battle of Manassas. They were eventually made a part of the First Corps (Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s) of the Army of Northern Virginia led by General Robert E. Lee. A school in Jasper was named in Lee&#x27;s honor and is occupied today by the County School Board Offices.
In 1865, the Savannah, Florida, and Western railway was completed, and a depot was built about a mile north of the town center. Businesses and homes migrated toward the railroad, and eventually the current town was established along that line. The town grew in earnest between 1890 and 1930, with a rich trade in turpentine, tobacco, cotton, and pine lumber. Jasper reached its pinnacle in the 1920s, with a booming population of over 2,000. Most of Jasper&#x27;s present buildings were built during this 40-year period.

Since the 1920s, Jasper has seen many economic changes. The leading cotton industry gave way to the turpentine industry, turpentine to lumber, lumber to tobacco, and finally tobacco to phosphate mining. The completion of Interstate 75 in the late 1950s caused further decline as tourists and shipping bypassed the city. 

In 2002, city officials extended the city limits and infrastructure to the intersection of US 129 and Interstate 75, and built infrastructure (water and sewer) with the help of county officials to the Hamilton County Industrial Park along US 41 in order to encourage economic growth and development. Since that time several new businesses have moved into the area, and the new high school has been built along the route.

The large jump in population between 2000 (1,780) and 2010 (4,546) was due to the incorporation of land containing the Hamilton County Correctional Facility into the city limits.

The first settlement in Hamilton County was called Micco Town or more accurately Hala-at-aha Micco which is interpreted as &quot;Chief of the Miccosukee&quot;; therefore, it is strongly believed to have been the home of Chief Billy Bowlegs who signed the 1823 Treaty of Moultrie.

<doc id="109189" wikidata="Q2036752" url="?curid=109189" title="White Springs, Florida">
<text>White Springs is a town in North Florida, United States, on the Suwannee River. It was developed as a tourist attraction for its mineral spring water baths. The population was 740 at the 2020 census. Home of the annual Florida Folk Festival, it is a tourist destination noted for historic charm, antique shops, and river recreation.

==History==
The Suwannee River was once the boundary between the Timucuan peoples to the east and the Apalachee people to the west. When Spanish explorers visited the area in the 1530s, the spring was visited by Natives from both sides of the river, who believed the water possessed healing powers. The Native Americans considered the spring a sacred healing ground, and used it even in times of war; any tribe member could bathe and drink the mineral waters without fear of being attacked. The spring water has a &quot;rotten egg&quot; sulfur smell that comes from dissolved hydrogen sulfide gas.

The settlement was formed in 1831 as Jackson Springs by businessmen Joseph Bryant, James T. Hooker, his brother William B. Hooker, John Lee, and James D. Prevatt. In addition to the spring, they planned to build a ferry across the Suwannee River.

The following year, Bryant Sheffield purchased the ferry operation rights and the spring, then known as &quot;White Sulpher [sic] Springs&quot;.
Sheffield drank the mineral waters and touted their ability to cure nervousness, kidney troubles, and rheumatism, among other problems. In 1842, he constructed a hotel and spring house from local timber.

During the Civil War, some Confederate soldiers found refuge in the town from Union troops. The family of future governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward, whose Jacksonville farm was burned by Union forces, moved to a nearby farm which they named &quot;Rebel&#x27;s Refuge&quot;. At some point, the springs were renamed &quot;White Sulphur Springs&quot;.

Following the Civil War, the tourist business slowly returned. In 1882, the Georgia merchants Wight and Powell purchased the property and platted city lots. They sold parcels to other retailers to open businesses catering to plantations and resorts around the spring. Crowds of health seekers arrived, first by stagecoach and then railroad. The Town of White Springs was incorporated in 1885. Hotels and boarding houses popped up; a cotton gin attracted buyers and sellers; and fashionable clothing and hats were offered for sale. Leisure activities included ballroom dancing, lawn tennis, and skating.
In 1903, the spring was enclosed by concrete and coquina walls that included multiple water gates and galleries to prevent water intrusion from river flooding. A four-story wooden bathhouse was constructed around the spring. The structure was designed by the Jacksonville architectural firm McClure &amp; Holmes for owner Minnie Mosher Jackson, and included doctors&#x27; offices for patient examination and treatment, dressing rooms, space for concessions, and an elevator. At the time, water flow was calculated at 32,400 gallons per minute, or nearly 47 million gallons per day.

During the 1930s, bathing in mineral springs fell out of favor in the United States and the town began to fade. In 1950, the Stephen Foster Memorial Museum opened to commemorate songwriter Stephen Foster, composer of the world-renowned song of the Suwannee River, &quot;Old Folks at Home&quot;. The museum is surrounded by formal gardens which extend to the banks of the Suwannee River. A carillon containing the world&#x27;s largest set of tubular bells,
 opened in 1957 and plays Foster&#x27;s songs throughout the day. The facility is a Florida State Park.

Through the 1980s, water flow at the spring declined to the point when it ceased flowing in 1990. The ex-mayor of White Springs, Dr. Helen Miller, was vice chairman of Florida Leaders Organized for Water (FLOW), a group which proposed the Floridan Aquifer Sustainability Act of 2013. The legislation seeks to restore the Floridan aquifer to 1980 levels.

In 2022, a white supremacist, neo-pagan religion known as the Asatru Folk Assembly (AFA), dedicated a Viking neo-pagan temple in White Springs. The temple for the hate group is dedicated to the Viking god Njord and is called &quot;Njordshof&quot; which means &quot;Njord&#x27;s temple&quot; in Old Norse, the language of the Vikings.

<text>Zolfo Springs is a town in Hardee County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Florida Heartland region. The population was 1,737 at the 2020 census.

==Etymology==
The name of the town got its name in the early 1800s, when a crew of miners from Spain and Italy looking for phosphate were sailing along the Peace River and came upon the spring, noting it had a strong sulfuric smell. Because of this, the Italians decided to call the area &quot;&quot;zolfo&quot;, which means &quot;sulfur&quot;&quot; in the Italian language.

==History==
Early prosperity in the area (where the settlement was known as &quot;Zolfo&quot;) was due to its location along the Florida Cracker Trail, a cattle trail from Bradenton to Fort Pierce. Cattle herded from this area and the Florida Heartland was run to the coasts along this route as early as 1850. The Florida Cracker Trail today includes parts of State Road 64 and State Road 66 through Zolfo Springs.

In 1886, transportation improved through Zolfo when the Florida Southern Railway (later the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad) was built through the town on its way from Bartow to Punta Gorda. The railroad built a depot in the town and a post office was established the same year. The railroad was removed in the early 1980s. Today US 17 runs along the former railroad right of way (with Main Street being the original alignment of US 17).

It was officially incorporated as a municipality on October 18, 1904, as the &quot;Town of Zolfo&quot;, but was officially renamed as the &quot;Town of Zolfo Springs&quot; on September 13, 1909.

<text>Clewiston is a city in Hendry County, Florida, United States. Its location is northwest of Fort Lauderdale on the Atlantic coastal plain. The population was 7,327 at the 2020 census, up from 7,155 at the 2010 census. It is the principal city in the Clewiston micropolitan area.

The city is located on the south bank of Lake Okeechobee, and the Lake Okeechobee Scenic Trail (LOST) passes through the edge of the city. It is home to the Clewiston Museum and the Dixie Crystal Theatre. The area has been home to Seminole tribe members and sugar plantations, with the Ah-Tah-Thi-Ki Seminole Indian Museum located south of the city.

==History==

The area beside Lake Okeechobee was once used as a fishing camp by the Seminole tribe. The first permanent settlement began in 1920, when John O&#x27;Brien of Philadelphia and Alonzo Clewis (1864-1944) of Tampa purchased a large tract of land to establish a town. They commissioned a town plan and built the Moore Haven &amp; Clewiston Railway to connect the community to the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad at Moore Haven. Incorporated as a city in 1925, Clewiston would become noted for its sport fishing, particularly of largemouth bass.

Large sugar plantations were established around Lake Okeechobee. By the 1950s and 1960s, the cultivation of citrus, vegetables and cattle were also important to the economy. The US Sugar Corporation, however, remained the dominant manufacturer in Clewiston, which became known as &quot;America&#x27;s Sweetest Town&quot;. On June 24, 2008, Governor Charlie Crist announced that the state of Florida had arranged to buy for $1.75 billion the company&#x27;s , including the refinery in Clewiston. 

On November 11, the plan was scaled back to $1.34 billion for of farmland, no longer including the mill, citrus processing facilities and other assets. This would allow the company to remain in business and leave open the possibility of preserving its 1,700 jobs. Over the next seven crop cycles, the farmland would be leased back from the state to US Sugar for $60 million. It would then be converted into reservoirs and water-filtering areas as part of the ongoing restoration of the Everglades ecosystem.

<text>Bayport is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Hernando County, Florida, United States. The population was 43 at the 2010 census.

==History==
The village of Bayport, located at the mouth of the Weeki Wachee River, sprang up in the early 1850s as a supply and cotton port. It was originally spelled as Bay Port and briefly served as the county seat until it was moved to Brooksville in 1856. During the Civil War, Union naval squadrons blockaded Florida&#x27;s coasts to prevent goods and supplies from passing into and out of the state. By 1863 the East Gulf Blockade Squadron had effectively closed the larger ports along the Gulf Coast. Small rivers, such as the Weeki Wachee, became important trade routes. Shipping at Bayport attracted the attention of the Union Blockade Squadron which intercepted eleven blockade runners near there between 1862 and 1865. Various skirmishes took place at Bayport between Union troops and the Confederate Home Guard during the course of the war. This included at least one raid by Union troops who had marched all the way north from Fort Myers. The Confederate cannon battery site can still be seen on the wooded point just north of the Bayport fishing pier at the mouth of the Weeki Wachee River.

After the war Bayport became Hernando County&#x27;s major outlet for lumber and agricultural products, and continued to serve as its transportation center until railroad service came to Brooksville in 1885.

In the spring of 2008, Hernando County and the Southwest Florida Water Management District rebuilt Bayport&#x27;s marina and park area.

==Geography==

== History ==
Hernando Beach, situated northwest of Tampa, FL, is a picturesque waterfront canal community renowned for its natural beauty and serene atmosphere. Developed by Charlie Sasser between 1959 and 1965, the area&#x27;s unique geography was shaped by earth sourced from coastal mining operations and extensive dredging efforts. The north section of Hernando Beach boasts deep and wide canals leading directly to the Gulf of Mexico, providing residents with unparalleled access to pristine waters.

However, the area&#x27;s growth faced regulatory challenges when wetland development restrictions were imposed in 1971, halting further expansion. This led to a legal dispute between Sasser, the state authorities, and the Hernando County Commission, resulting in the preservation of Hernando Beach&#x27;s natural state. Despite these legal battles, Sasser&#x27;s legacy lives on as visitors and residents alike continue to appreciate the area&#x27;s untouched allure and breathtaking coastal flats.

Hernando Beach comprises three distinct sections, each offering unique amenities and lifestyle opportunities. The northern portion features saltwater canals ideal for boaters seeking direct Gulf access, while the middle section boasts a network of streets off Hermosa Boulevard. In contrast, the southern Hernando Beach area is characterized by deed-restricted properties overseen by the Hernando Beach South Property Owners Association. For residents in the southern region, indirect Gulf access canals are navigated using a boatlift system to traverse the earthen berm separating them from the Gulf, providing a seamless connection to the direct access saltwater canals and the Gulf beyond.

== Hurricanes ==

Hurricane Idalia 2023: Idalia was a Category 4 hurricane that hit the Big Bend region of Florida on August 30. This devastating storm resulted in significant damage to areas in the southeastern United States, specifically Northern Florida, and caused the loss of businesses and homes. It emerged as the tenth tropical storm, third hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 2023 Atlantic hurricane season as it formed from a low-pressure area that crossed Central America from the Pacific Ocean. The system strengthened into a tropical depression on August 26, 2023. Upon traversing the Gulf of Mexico, it underwent rapid intensification, briefly becoming a Category 4 hurricane before making landfall in Florida as a Category 3 hurricane. It remained a hurricane as it advanced to Southeast Georgia, later transforming into a post-tropical cyclone that same day. Idalia caused tremendous damage across Florida and southeastern Georgia, resulting in four fatalities and thousands of damaged or destroyed structures.

Hurricane Helene 2024: Hurricane Helene made a significant impact on Hernando Beach, FL on September 26, 2024, leaving behind considerable damage and flooding. As the storm swept through, it brought rain, and a storm surge that led to widespread flooding. Homes along the coast suffered damage, with some areas experiencing power outages for several days. The community was particularly hit hard, as docks and boats were damaged or destroyed. Hurricane Helene swept up the coastline, just 90 miles offshore, with winds over 120 mph near its core. It kept gaining strength as it moved northeast, hitting the county’s coastal areas with hurricane-force winds and pushing tropical-storm-force winds far inland. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predicted storm surges of 8-12 feet for the area, prompting Hernando County officials to order a mandatory evacuation for areas west of US 19. It’s estimated that Helene’s storm surge did reach 8-feet in the coastal community of Hernando Beach. Most single story homes lost everything in the storm surge.

<text>Masaryktown is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Hernando County, Florida, United States. The population was 1,077 at the 2020 census. It is named after the first president of Czechoslovakia, Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk.

==History==
Masaryktown was founded in 1924 and named after Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, the founder and first president of Czechoslovakia. Of the original 61 persons who met to found the town, 60 were Slovak and only one was Czech.  They formed the Hernando Plantation Company and sold at a price of $1,000.00 per share, which granted the right for each share-owner to purchase 20 acres of land. The settlers first planted oranges, but killer frosts devastated the orchards. Many Slovaks eventually left, and by 1952, only 15-25 families remained to carry on a more prosperous enterprise in chicken farming. But even they declined by 1965 due to intense competition.

Few Slovaks remain there today, but the legacy of their settlement remains, as the original founders named the streets running east to west after Slovak national and literary leaders such as Štúr, Hurban, Kollár, Štefánik, Hodža, Hviezdoslav, and Mudron. One street is named after the famous Czech historian, Palacký, and the central boulevard is named after Masaryk. North-south streets are named in honor of American presidents such as Wilson, who assisted in enabling Czecho-Slovak independence, as well as Jefferson, Madison, and Lincoln.

<doc id="109212" wikidata="Q2321558" url="?curid=109212" title="Spring Hill, Florida">
<text>Spring Hill is a census-designated place (CDP) in Hernando County, Florida, United States. The population was 113,568 at the 2020 census, up from 98,621 at the 2010 census. Spring Hill belongs to Florida&#x27;s Nature Coast region and is in the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater metro area. It is east of Hernando Beach, southwest of Brooksville, and north of Tampa.

==History and overview==
Spring Hill was formerly a large tract of endangered Longleaf Pine Ecosystem and Sand Pine Scrub with very high biodiversity, and a safe haven for many imperiled species, and most of it remained unchanged until the 1970’s with large scale deforestation. It first appeared on Hernando County maps as early as 1856 along what is today Fort Dade Avenue just north of the community of Wiscon. The modern Spring Hill was founded in 1967 as a planned community, which was developed by the Deltona Corporation and the Mackle Brothers. The developers originally wanted to call the community Spring Lake and used that as the working name through the development process. They were forced to use a different name due to the name Spring Lake already being in use locally and chose Spring Hill. The plans for the community are identical to the community of Deltona. The Mackle Brothers sold many of the properties and land in the area through intense advertising. It has since become a sprawling semi-city in its own right, though it is an unincorporated area. The main entrance to the original development is marked by the Spring Hill waterfall on Spring Hill Drive and U.S. Route 19 (Commercial Way).

Spring Hill&#x27;s proximity to Tampa, to the south, and the completion of the Suncoast Parkway in 2001 have made the community easily accessible to the Tampa-St. Petersburg area.

==Weeki Wachee Springs==
===Tourist attraction===

Weeki Wachee Springs, the spring of the Weeki Wachee River, is a Florida tourist attraction where underwater performances by mermaids — women dressed in fancy outfits with fins about their legs — can be viewed in an aquarium-like setting. The attraction includes a Buccaneer Bay water park, animal shows, and boat rides. General Manager Robyn Anderson was the town&#x27;s mayor. The park is now a Florida State Park and is owned and managed by the State Parks department.

===Deepest naturally formed spring in the United States===
From May 22 until August 30, 2007, the discharge level at Weeki Wachee spring dropped to a level that allowed for cave divers to gain effective entry into the cave system at the spring. The Karst Underwater Research team successfully executed exploration dives and the necessary in-water decompression to explore approximately in multiple passages at an average depth of fresh water (ffw) with a maximum depth of ffw.

<text>Avon Park is a city in Highlands County, Florida, United States. As of the 2020 census, the population was 9,658, up from 8,836 at the 2010 census but down from the 2018 estimated population of 10,695. It is part of the Sebring, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. It is the oldest city in Highlands County, and was named after Stratford-upon-Avon, England.

==History==
The first permanent white settler in Avon Park was Oliver Martin Crosby, a Connecticut native who moved to the area in 1884 to study the wildlife of the Everglades. By 1886, enough people had followed that the &quot;Town of Lake Forest&quot; was founded. As president of the Florida Development Company, he recruited settlers to the area, many of whom were from England, including many from the town of Stratford-upon-Avon, who gave the town its name.

=== 1927–29 spring training ground of the St. Louis Cardinals ===
From 1927 to 1929, Avon Park&#x27;s newly constructed Cardinal Field (now Head Field) was the spring training ground of the St. Louis Cardinals, a Major League Baseball team. Avon Park resident Charles R. Head convinced his friend Sam Breadon, the owner of the Cardinals, to move the baseball team&#x27;s spring training ground to the city.

The spring training matches were very popular affairs and many matches saw attendances above the entire population of the city. On March 16, 1928, before a spring training match between the New York Yankees and St. Louis Cardinals, residents presented Yankees player Babe Ruth with a , commemorative baseball bat in a pre-game ceremony. Ruth also struck a home run which landed on a nearby street and the city had the street renamed &quot;Ruth Street&quot; in his honor.

At the end of the agreement in 1929, Breadon moved the Cardinals&#x27; spring training ground to Bradenton, citing inadequate hotel facilities and poor field conditions. Avon Park mayor C. S. Donaldson disputed Breadon&#x27;s accusations and claimed that the city had five excellent hotels and that the field was well maintained, had a modern clubhouse to accommodate players, and was even built to the specifications of the team, under the supervision of a Cardinals groundskeeper.

=== &quot;Gough v. State&quot; ===
In September 1949, the city elected the youngest mayor in United States history at the time, 21-year-old Wiley Sauls Jr., largely due to the votes of the second precinct, which was populated mostly by black residents. Sauls Jr. received 76% of the precinct&#x27;s votes, and he went from third out of five candidates to first and usurped incumbent mayor O. C. Wilkes, who only received 20 votes from the second precinct.

In the following city-wide election on September 11, 1951, the second precinct was allowed for the first time to be staffed and managed by its majority black populace. The overseeing inspector of the second precinct and the second precinct&#x27;s clerks were all black. Wilkes challenged Sauls Jr. for the mayorship, and he received a slim eight vote majority in the first precinct, but Sauls Jr. received 92.5% of the votes in the second precinct and comfortably defeated Wilkes. Two new city councilmen, Mannin Kirkland and J. B. Sparks, were also elected to the city council largely due to the votes of the second precinct.

The incumbent city council met four days after the election and heard Wilkes&#x27; protest, who claimed that there were voter irregularities in the second precinct and that they should install him as mayor. The city council refused Wilkes&#x27; demands, but he began lobbying local influencers and convinced the council to convene a special session on September 25. Wilkes alleged in this second meeting that the second precinct had not returned all of its blank ballots after the election and that this called into question the validity of the results. The council voted 3–1, with one abstention, to throw out the votes of the second precinct, which prompted Wilkes to immediately begin acting as mayor, while Kirkland and Sparks were to be replaced by E. W. Gough and Oscar Wolff.

Sauls Jr., Kirkland, and Sparks hired attorney Keith Collyer, who argued that it was unlawful that a mere claim of irregularities would give the council the authority to install themselves into office in the face of a challenge to their power. While the circuit court sided with Sauls Jr., Kirkland, and Sparks, and demanded that the three be put into power, Wilkes and the council through attorney S. C. Pardee Sr. pushed the case upwards through the judicial system and also began to argue that the second precinct&#x27;s inspector, W. J. Robinson, had helped people to cast their ballots. The Supreme Court of Florida also voted in favor of Sauls Jr., Kirkland, and Sparks, and the three were then installed as mayor and councilmen respectively and put municipal governments on notice that they did not have the authority to invalidate an election in order to remain in power.

=== 1950s military plane crashes ===
On November 4, 1950, a Republic F-84 Thunderjet being flown by 22-year-old Donald Floyd Whiston of the United States Air Force from Naval Air Station Albany (formerly Turner Air Force Base) during training for the Korean War, crashed into the ground, killing Whiston, at the Avon Park Air Force Range, just northeast of the city, after apparently stalling in the sky.

Less than eight years later, on March 21, 1958, a Boeing B-47 Stratojet being flown from MacDill Air Force Base crashed into the ground at Avon Park Air Force Range. All four occupants were killed in the resulting explosion.

=== Operation Drop Kick ===
In 1956, the U.S. Army Chemical Corps released 600,000 uninfected yellow fever mosquitoes from a plane from Avon Park Air Force Range over the city in order to test how efficiently the mosquitoes spread after conducting a similar experiment in Savannah, Georgia earlier in the year. The experiment was part of Operation Drop Kick, a series of military experiments to determine the practicality of employing mosquitoes to carry an entomological warfare agent in different ways. A day after the release the mosquitoes had spread between to in each direction and bitten many residents.

In 1958, the Chemical Corps conducted further tests from Avon Park Air Force Range and determined that mosquitoes could be easily disseminated from helicopters, devices dropped from planes, or by being deployed from the ground. Chemical Corps researchers found that the mosquitoes would spread more than a mile in each direction from where they were deployed and that they would quickly enter all types of buildings.

On October 28, 1980, the documents detailing the experiments were declassified as part of the Church of Scientology&#x27;s legal battles with the federal government under the Freedom of Information Act. After the Church of Scientology obtained the documents, the group made them available to journalists.

=== 2006 Illegal Immigrant Relief Act ===
In 2006, then mayor Thomas Macklin proposed City Ordinance 08-06, or the Illegal Immigrant Relief Act, which would have blocked the issuance or renewal of city licenses to businesses that hired undocumented aliens, fined any property owner who rented and leased property to undocumented aliens, and established English as the city&#x27;s official language, banning the use of other languages during the conduct of official business except where specified under state or federal law. In the weeks before the vote, local businesses saw a drop in sales as immigrants became wary of coming into shop and droves of workers stopped showing up to local farms out of fear of being arrested. The ordinance was defeated by the city council, on a 3–2 vote.

==Points of interest==

===Lake Placid Tower===
The structure, built by Ridge Builders, and previously called the Happiness Tower, is a closed concrete block observation tower located on US Highway 27. It is tall according to early sources (before 1982), although later sources (after 1986) have indicated that it is tall. Because its antennae are above sea level, and it rests on ground above sea level (392–142=250), only the 240-foot architectural height is plausible. It has three observation levels, at behind windows, at on a balcony, and at atop the elevator shaft. It was designed by architect A. Wynn Howell of Lakeland, built in 1960, and opened January 1, 1961. It was the tallest concrete block structure in the world when it opened.

For years, the tower was open to tourists who could take a 65 second elevator ride to the observation deck. Because of sluggish sales, the tower closed in 2003 and is now a cell phone tower.

===Historical Society Depot Museum===
The Old Lake Placid Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Depot, now the Historical Society Depot Museum of the Lake Placid Historical Society, is a historic Atlantic Coast Line Railroad depot in Lake Placid, Florida. It is located at 12 East Park Street and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
===Wall murals===
There are 51 large murals on the sides of buildings in Lake Placid&#x27;s &quot;uptown&quot; area. These have become a tourist attraction. The Welcome Center sells a booklet with a map of the murals that provides specifics about the history that each one depicts, as well as information about the artist(s).

The murals were planned in 1992 by Harriet and Bob Porter and were painted in subsequent years by various artists, most depicting the history of the area. Some feature the &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; technique.

<text>Sebring ( ) is a city in and the county seat of Highlands County, Florida, United States. It is nicknamed &quot;The City on the Circle&quot;, in reference to Circle Drive, the center of the Sebring Downtown Historic District. It is the principal city of the Sebring, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area. As of 2022 United States Census estimates, the population is 11,379, up from 10,729 at the 2020 census. The broader Sebring metropolitan area had a population estimate of 105,618 in 2022; the disparity in population between the city proper and the metropolitan area is due to the relatively small size of the annexed area of the city, with most all of the landmass west of Lake Jackson technically in unincorporated Highlands County.

Sebring is centered around Lake Jackson, with the Downtown Historic District directly on the waterfront. Due to its Florida scrub terrain, Lake Jackson has natural white sand beaches, and is a popular boating and swimming destination. Sebring is the home of the Sebring International Raceway, best known as the host of the 12 Hours of Sebring, an annual WeatherTech SportsCar Championship race that attracts fans and teams from around the world. Nearby Highlands Hammock State Park is a popular attraction, and was the first state park created in Florida. The city features a large 1768-acre airfield, the Sebring Regional Airport. Additionally, Sebring became a popular development and tourist destination of the 1920s, hailed as the &quot;Coral Gables of Central Florida&quot;. Many grandiose Mediterranean buildings of that time period still exist within the city, the most notable being the Harder Hall Hotel and Resort.

== History ==

Sebring was founded in 1912. It was named after George E. Sebring (1859–1927), a pottery manufacturer from Ohio who developed the city. He had a circular plan as the focal point for the city. It was chartered by the state of Florida in 1913, and was selected as the county seat of Highlands County when the county was created in 1921. The village of Sebring, Ohio, is also named for George E. Sebring and his family.

Sebring is known for its collection of historic and historically designated buildings. The Sebring Train Station, Sebring Fire Station, and the Highlands County Courthouse are all National Register of Historic Places buildings that are still in service, as well as the entire Sebring Downtown Historic District, consisting of shops, restaurants, offices, businesses and apartments all bordered by the water. Harder Hall Resort and the Kenilworth Lodge are both surviving examples of large, extravagant boom time hotels.

=== 2019 shooting ===

On January 23, 2019, 21-year-old Sebring resident Zephen Xaver entered a SunTrust bank off of U.S. Route 27 wearing a ballistic vest under his sweatshirt and armed with a 9 mm handgun. Xaver forced five women inside to lie on the ground before fatally shooting them all. Xaver then had a 2-hour standoff with responding police before eventually agreeing to surrender, after which SWAT drove an armored vehicle through the front entrance of the bank and arrested him.

A year later, after the bank was demolished, a new park was opened up in its place called Reflection Park. The park features a pentagon shaped plaque with sunbeams from the SunTrust logo emblazoned on it, with each side of the pentagon representing a life lost in the attack.

==Culture and attractions==
Sebring has a number of museums and arts facilities, including the
*Children&#x27;s Museum of the Highlands, located in the heart of downtown featuring interactive activities for children ages 1–12
*Charles F. Weigle House Museum, administered by the Sebring Historical Society and highlighting the history of the city and its notable residents

The airport is also the home of the Sebring International Raceway, the host of the 12 Hours of Sebring, second round of WeatherTech SportsCar Championship automobile race series, held annually in March. The airport has also hosted the annual US Sport Aviation Expo for eight years. The nearest regularly scheduled passenger service is provided at Orlando International Airport, by road to the north.

The city is served by Amtrak from the Sebring station, a depot built in 1924 by the Seaboard Air Line and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Amtrak&#x27;s daily service to Sebring consists of two trains each from the &quot;Silver Meteor&quot; and &quot;Silver Star&quot;, heading south to Miami and north to Tampa, Orlando and New York City. CSX Transportation owns the track over which Amtrak operates.

There were 5,886 households, of which 27% had children under the age of 18 living with them, and 63% were married couples living together, both higher than the state average.

==History==
The history of Apollo Beach started in 1923 on land owned by the Dickman family, then used annually for farming and grazing pasture. Much of the land was mangrove and low-elevation and was considered uninhabitable.

In the 1930s, Paul Dickman conceived the idea of a waterfront community. He felt the location was ideally located equidistant between Tampa and Bradenton along U.S. Route 41.

The Dickmans secured the services of Radar Engineering of Miami to design a subdivision including roads, canals, schools, recreation areas, and community services.

In the early 1950s, Dickman negotiated the sale of the land to three men from New York: Turner, Dean and Clark. They named the land &quot;Tampa Beach&quot;, believing the association with Tampa would attract interested persons more readily than a name which did not properly locate the area geographically.

Construction began on the Flamingo Canal near U.S. 41 and proceeded toward Fairway Boulevard. It was their intention to extend the canal to Tampa Bay so as to achieve access to open water. The task became too large for the amount of capital they had invested and for the abilities of the persons involved, and in 1956 they notified Dickman they could not go through with the project.

In 1957, Francis Corr, a retired businessman from Michigan, purchased the land. Corr renamed the area &quot;La Vida Beach&quot;. Legend has it that in 1958 Corr&#x27;s wife Dorothy suggested a new name, &quot;Apollo Beach&quot;, for the area&#x27;s greatest benefit — sunshine. Mr. Corr started construction of 50 homes in the area between U.S. 41 and Golf &amp; Sea Boulevard.
In early 1958, Corr reached an agreement with Robert E. Lee, a South Carolina contractor, to join in the development. Lee was to continue the dredging of canals, and in exchange was to receive parcels of land.

In the early 1960s, Francis Corr sold his company and the Apollo Beach land to a Miami company known as Flora Sun Corporation. Flora Sun sold some of the land on the northern end to the Tampa Electric Company for a power plant site on the land&#x27;s northern border, which is now the Big Bend Power Station. Flora Sun failed in its obligations in the purchase of the land from the Corr family, and about seven years later the family got the land back out of bankruptcy court.

In the mid-1960s, Corr&#x27;s son Thomas moved his young family to the area to continue work on the Apollo Beach project; however, while the land was in bankruptcy proceedings from Flora Sun, the dredge and fill permits required to construct the canal system expired.

The Corr family continued to struggle with the development over the years, facing regulatory hurdles and tightening growth policy in Florida with the passage of the growth management act in 1972 and expanded policies in 1984.

Thomas Corr continued to develop the community and donated land for parks and schools and preserving hundreds of acres of mangrove swamps and environmental areas. He started a community bank, a chamber of commerce, civic clubs and festivals. Thomas Corr died in 1998. In 2006, Hillsborough County honored the work of Thomas Corr by naming the new elementary school on Big Bend Road the Thomas P. Corr Elementary School.

Today Apollo Beach is a thriving waterfront community with year-round boating, fishing, and other water activities. The estimated of canals lead to Tampa Bay.

In 1890 the railway was routed through Brandon, and Bloomingdale began to decline as businessmen like D.J. Galvin, who owned a feed store on the property that is now Mulrennan Middle School, moved to Brandon for access to all the benefits provided by the railroad. In 1910, the post office closed. In 1920, the school closed and the students were sent to Brandon instead. The community declined, or at best remained stable until the 1960s, when it became a bedroom community for Tampa.

<text>Brandon is an unincorporated community and census-designated place (CDP) in Hillsborough County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Tampa–St. Petersburg–Clearwater Metropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 114,626 at the 2020 census, up from 103,483 at the 2010 census.

==History==

===Founding===
On January 20, 1857, John Brandon arrived at Fort Brooke (now Tampa) from Mississippi with his first wife Martha, his seven sons, and their seven slaves. At first they moved to what is now the Seffner area. Then in August 1858, John Brandon purchased in the New Hope area (now Brandon) and later on and then named his land &quot;Brandon&quot;. John and his second wife Victoria&#x27;s house was located on what would become the corner of Knights Avenue and Victoria Street. Four years later, the New Hope Church was built on land donated by Brandon. Besides being the first church in the community, it also served as Brandon&#x27;s first school.

In 1890, the Florida Central and Peninsular Railroad came through the area, encouraging the people of New Hope to build a depot on Moon Avenue. Charles S. Noble, an engineer for the FC&amp;P, was asked to plat approximately forty acres of land north of present-day State Road 60, south of Lake Meade, east of Kings Avenue, and west to Parsons Avenue. Filed on April 24, 1890, the surveyor named the community in honor of John Brandon and Noble Street for himself.

Stowers Funeral Home is a famous landmark in Brandon, in a building erected by John Brandon&#x27;s son James.

===Early 20th century===
Since then, Brandon has grown in spurts, beginning with the first general store opened by Dan Galvin on the corner of Moon Avenue and Victoria Street. In 1905 a school was built on Parsons Avenue, and Victoria Brandon allowed new teachers to board with her.

At the time, Valrico began to develop to the east as Victoria&#x27;s son Lovic moved there and opened a general store. Lovic and Victoria&#x27;s other son, Mark, organized the Valrico Baptist Church in 1915, which later moved to Brandon and became the First Baptist Church in 1930.

By 1914, the community needed a large central school to house all of the area&#x27;s students, so the Brandon Grade School (now McLane Middle School) was built on Knights Avenue to house grades 1 through 12. In 1919 Brandon Grade School enrolled the largest class to date totaling 119 students. The school&#x27;s first Principal, John T. Bushong was responsible for expanding the school to grade 12 and in 1923 it graduated four seniors.

The first Brandon census was taken in 1922 when the population was 100. In 1925, Hopewell Road became a paved road, and residents such as Clarence Hampton began building businesses along it in 1927. Hampton opened the first gas and service station.

During the 1920s, the eastern border of Brandon was Pinewood Avenue. Beyond that was the Kingsway Poultry Colony, where chickens were raised during the winter to be sold in Ybor City. During the Great Depression the poultry farms closed, until around 1946, when Bill and Ann Hollash moved to Brandon and started Brandon Egg (which later became Hollash Eggs), the largest egg producers in eastern Hillsborough County. Hollash Eggs closed in the late 1990s. The original farm, over , was sold to what is now Bell Shoals Baptist Church.

Most local residents worked in the two orange packing houses in Valrico. The center of town remained at Moon Avenue and Victoria Street, where the train depot, post office, school, and grocery store were all located. For entertainment and everything else, the train to Tampa was the way to go, as only a few paved roads existed, with most being dirt- or shell-topped, making the drive to Tampa very difficult.

World War II was an interesting time in Brandon, with little growth, but a definite edge as they had the food they raised on their farms. After the war, new businesses began to open. A drug store and soda fountain at the corner of Parsons Avenue and Hopewell Road quickly became a popular teenage hangout. In 1950, Scogin&#x27;s opened their famous variety store on Hopewell Road, and in 1953 Brandon got its first physician, Dr. V. R. Hunter.

The 1950s were the beginning of the real growth period for Brandon. Yates Elementary was built in 1954, followed by Mann Junior High School in 1957. Brandon Grade School, on Knights Avenue, became the first Brandon High School. At the time, there were fewer than 100 graduates a year. In 1956, Hopewell Road was connected to Adamo Drive, which made access to Tampa easier, thus turning Brandon into a bedroom community. With commuters came subdivisions, the first of which was Hill-Dale Heights on Kingsway Avenue. The &quot;Brandon News&quot; was established in 1958 as a one-page newsletter and advertisement for Scogin&#x27;s clothing store, written by Al &amp; Chris Scogin. Brandon&#x27;s first honorary mayor&#x27;s race was held in 1959 and was won by Nat Storms.

===Era of rapid growth===
In 1959, the Brandon Chamber of Commerce was formed to help promote business and growth. By the early 1960s, Brandon&#x27;s population was 8,000, and it was estimated that one new family moved into town every day. Brandon began spreading out into the bordering communities of Limona, Seffner, and Valrico; Hopewell Road became four lanes wide and was designated State Road 60. Soon, the town&#x27;s first shopping center, Brandon Center, was built, and Brooker Elementary School and the Brandon Swim and Tennis Club opened in 1961 and 1963 respectively. In the next few years, Kingswood Elementary School, the Brandon Public Library, and many housing developments, shopping centers, and golf courses further fueled or reflected the influx of new residences and businesses.

By the 1970s, growth was causing traffic congestion, as approximately 430 commercial and service businesses, three malls and a population of 40,000 were all contained within a radius.

In the mid-1970s, Hillsborough Community College moved to Brandon by holding classes at public schools. More indications of the increasing population were the building of Brandon Community Hospital and the Brandon Cultural Center (now the Center Place Fine Arts and Civic Association).

Brandon took off rapidly during the 1980s. Development of the southern area of Brandon brought thousands of new residents. On September 27, 1986, Interstate 75 began to bring traffic through the Brandon area, dramatically changing the community and helping its population reach nearly 58,000 by 1990.

==Geography==
Brandon&#x27;s census boundaries include Palm River-Clair Mel to the west across U.S. Route 301, Valrico to the east, Riverview and Bloomingdale to the south, and East Lake-Orient Park, Mango, and Seffner to the north.

FishHawk Ranch by Newland Communities is a planned community composed of several distinct villages over 3,000+ acres. FishHawk Ranch contains several public common areas including the Park Square Town Center, the Lake House, the Palmetto Club clubhouse, the Osprey Club, the Aquatic Center, biking/walking trails, community swimming pools, gym facilities, tennis courts, lakes, and ponds. FishHawk Ranch was the first certified green new-home community in Hillsborough County. The community is part of a Community Development District and residents pay a CDD fee for their respective CDD designation or subdivision.

The FishHawk area is also noted for its high-ranking, A-rated schools.

==History==
FishHawk Trails and FishHawk Ranch formerly operated as a ranch; these two subdivisions were built by two different companies in the 1990s.

Before these subdivisions were constructed, FishHawk Trails was a wooded location through which a CSX Transportation rail track path passed. The rail tracks were removed in the late 1980s. There was once a train station in the FishHawk area that was the main import/export area of supplies, mail, and food for Lithia residents.

==Environmental impact==

Starling at FishHawk and The Preserve were previously an undeveloped wildlife habitat. The Florida Green Building Coalition has named FishHawk as a &quot;green&quot; community, the first in Hillsborough County and the largest in the Tampa area. In 2003, the National Arbor Day Foundation honored the FishHawk community preservation efforts.

==International Independent Showmen&#x27;s Association and Museum==

Gibsonton is the location of the International Independent Showmen&#x27;s Association (Gibtown Showmen&#x27;s Club), a non-profit private organization made up of people in the outdoor amusement industry. The original club building opened in 1966 and expanded to be the largest showmen&#x27;s association in the United States. There are over 4,500 members from all over the United States and several foreign countries.

Gibsonton is also the home of the largest trade show in the carnival industry. Exhibits include rides, food supplies and equipment, concession trailers, electrical supplies, insurance companies, novelty items, plush toys, and jewelry.

Gibtown&#x27;s International Independent Showmen&#x27;s Museum houses on two floors a wide assortment of antique equipment, historic printed materials and detailed exhibits that tell the carnival story – most of it donated by practicing carnies. Carnival items from across the country reflecting nearly a century of carnival experiences have been donated.

The museum features photos of carnival setups throughout the years, with a particular focus on carnival transportation and the role that Gibsonton played in carnival history. The museum has one of the first Ferris wheels in the U.S., which is assembled right in the middle of the exhibits. Visitors can enjoy artifacts such as a slinky black-beaded costume worn by famous burlesque dancer Gypsy Rose Lee as well as an outfit worn by the Viking Giant Jóhann K. Pétursson. Visitors are also able to walk through carnie trailers, which open to transform from a dull-looking compartment into brightly lit and ornate facades.

===Library connection===
The library at the University of South Florida (USF) has digitized many of the photos at the International Independent Showmen&#x27;s Museum. These photographs are a part of Special Collections at USF. The homepage of the collection describes the photographs as portraying the life and times of the American carnival from the late 1800s to today. The collection features many photographs that relate to means of transportation as relevant to the carnival, such as semi-trailers and trains.

Digital access to the collection is available through the USF website. The physical collection lives at the International Independent Showmen&#x27;s Museum. Much of the digitization process was made possible by members of the International Independent Showmen&#x27;s Association as well as a grant from the Community Foundation of Greater Sun City Center.

In addition to the collection of photographs, the USF Library has a digital collection of showmen&#x27;s oral histories. An oral history is both &quot;a method of recording and preserving oral testimony&quot; and the product that comes from this process. These are valuable pieces of cultural heritage that capture the memories of a person during a particular time.

<text>Lake Magdalene is a census-designated place (CDP) in Hillsborough County, Florida, United States. It is part of the Tampa Bay area. The population was 30,742 at the 2020 census.

== History ==
As a rural community northwest of Tampa, this area of Hillsborough County had welcomed enough residents to receive its first post office in 1888, followed by a scattering of schools and churches—most notably the United Brethren Church 
(now Lake Magdalene United Methodist), started in 1895 by Reverend Isaac W. Bearss, whose family line still maintains several acres of citrus groves in the region, butted up against the busy east-west, North Tampa corridor that bears the family name. The rustic qualities of Lake Magdalene remained until the 1990s when residential construction in Tampa pushed northward. By 1990 almost 16,000 people lived in Lake Magdalene, and according to the 2000 census, its population had nearly doubled to 28,755.

Lake Magdalene is surrounded by, and takes its name from, a freshwater lake. The lake&#x27;s name may come from the moniker of a Native American woman, Magdalena, who interpreted the language for a Spanish expedition into Florida in 1549, or the name may have resulted from the 1882 marriage in the community of John Parrish and Mary Magdalene Yates, daughter of Jonah Yates, first mayor of Plant City.

==Geography==
Lake Magdalene is located in northwestern Hillsborough County at (28.081294, -82.477945).

Interstate 275 forms the eastern edge of the CDP, and the Dale Mabry Highway (Florida State Road 597) forms the western edge.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the community has a total area of , of which are land and , or 12.11%, are water. There are at least 11 named lakes in the CDP, the largest of which is Lake Magdalene near the center of the community.

<text>Lutz is an unincorporated community in Hillsborough County and Pasco County, Florida, United States, north of Tampa. While there is a census-designated area of Lutz, the community itself extends beyond those boundaries into other census-designated areas.

==History==
Lutz began with the construction of a small train depot on the Tampa Northern Railroad. The area surrounding the depot officially became known as &quot;Lutz&quot; when the U.S. Postal Service authorized a post office. The community was named for W. P. Lutz, who was credited with bringing the railroad to town.

As people moved to the rural community from Tampa, the Lutz area continued to grow until it no longer depended on the &quot;Lutz Junction&quot;, which was demolished in the late 1960s.

In 2000, a replica of the depot was rebuilt in the approximate location, which is now at the intersection of Lutz-Lake Fern Road and U.S. Highway 41. The post office&#x27;s structure is still in the same place today, although it is now an art gallery. A public library is located behind the train depot replica. This area is known as &quot;Beautiful Downtown Lutz&quot; and had a song written about it in 1981.

Part of the movie &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot; was filmed on Tinsmith Circle in the neighborhood of Carpenter&#x27;s Run in north Lutz in Pasco County. In the credits the town is named in the &quot;Thank you&quot; section.

<text>Plant City is an incorporated city in Hillsborough County, Florida, United States, approximately midway between Brandon and Lakeland along Interstate 4. It is part of the Tampa Bay area. The population was 39,764 at the 2020 census.

Despite many thinking it was named for flora grown at plant nurseries (especially vegetables and fruits, as well as tropical houseplants) in its subtropical Gulf Coast climate, it was named after prominent railroad developer Henry B. Plant (see Plant System).

Plant City is known as the winter strawberry capital of the world and hosts the annual Florida Strawberry Festival in the late winter (usually in February or early March), which is attended by people from all over the world.

==History==
Plant City&#x27;s original name given during the middle 1800s was &quot;Ichepuckesassa&quot;, after the Native American village that once occupied the territory. In 1860, the community was renamed &quot;&quot;Cork&quot;, after the postmaster&#x27;s Irish hometown. It was finally given the name &quot;Plant City&quot; in commemoration of Henry B. Plant and his South Florida Railroad, which significantly boosted the commerce in this primarily agricultural community by incorporating it on January 10, 1885. In 1911, it was officially reincorporated from the &quot;Town&quot; of Plant City&quot; to the &quot;&quot;City&quot; of Plant City&quot;.

Plant City was the spring training home of baseball&#x27;s Cincinnati Reds, who played exhibition games at Plant City Stadium from 1988 to 1997.

<text>Riverview is an unincorporated census-designated place in Hillsborough County, Florida, United States. It is located south of Brandon. The population was 107,396 in the 2020 census, up from 71,050 in the 2010 census.

Many of Tampa Bay&#x27;s radio and television stations broadcast from an antenna farm in the Riverview area, on Boyette Road, east of town. Riverview is home to Bell Creek Nature Preserve.

== History ==
Riverview was founded in 1885 on the Alafia River&#x27;s north shore. However, in the 1830s settlers arrived on the south side of the river at an area formerly known as Peru (pronounced &quot;Pe-Roo&quot;) because &quot;Peru&quot; was an indigenous name for &quot;straight part of the river&quot;. Peru existed for nearly 100 years and was one of the oldest settlements in central Florida. It wasn&#x27;t until the 1940s that Riverview absorbed Peru, and now claims the south side of the Alafia River. The Peruvian Mining Company, which mined phosphate from the Alafia, took its name from the settlement. The term &quot;Alafia&quot; is translated as &quot;River of Fire&quot; due to the phosphorus on the early riverbottom glowing at night.

The area&#x27;s first school was built in 1893, inside the Peru Baptist Church. The area called Riverview began to be populated on the north side of the river. The two communities were connected by a river ferry. Soon after, a bridge was constructed from sections of a bridge that once spanned the Hillsborough River in downtown Tampa. The post office periodically was moved from the Riverview side to the Peru side of the river and back, causing much tension. The Riverview name eventually came into usage in the early 1940s by the post office to relieve just such confusion with the mail. Peru has disappeared from all but the earliest maps. Some of Peru&#x27;s or Riverview&#x27;s settlers include the Barnes, Bourgees, Boyettes, Brandons, Buzbees, Hackneys, Hancocks, Hartleys, Mansfields, Moodys, Simmons, Scotts, Symmes, Topes, Thompsons, Whitts, and the Yeomans. The area founded by the Boyette family is now the community of Boyette, located in the eastern part of the Riverview CDP.

The first commercial poultry farm in Florida was established by Emmet and Myrtle Tope in Riverview in 1921.

<text>Ruskin is an unincorporated census-designated place in Hillsborough County, Florida, United States. The area was part of the chiefdom of the Uzita at the time of the Hernando de Soto expedition in 1539. The community was founded August 7, 1908, on the shores of the Little Manatee River. It was developed by Dr. George McAnelly Miller, an attorney and professor at Ruskin College in Trenton, Missouri, and Addie Dickman Miller. It is named after the essayist and social critic John Ruskin. Miller established the short-lived Ruskin College. It was one of the Ruskin Colleges.

==History==
The town and college were named after the English writer and social reformist John Ruskin. Ruskin, a utopian, founded the Guild of St George, a celebration of workmanship that underpinned the Arts and Crafts movement of William Morris. Ruskin was a passionate educator.

In 1907, Dr. George McAnelly Miller, a former Chicago prosecuting attorney and professor, and former president of Ruskin College in Trenton, Missouri, relocated his family to the area, along with his brother-in-law Albert Peter Dickman&#x27;s family. They purchased land and started to set up homes, a sawmill, and a school. Addie Dickman Miller, Dr. Miller&#x27;s wife, founded a post office on August 7, 1908. This day is recognized as the official founding day of the town. The Ruskin Commongood Society platted Ruskin on February 19, 1910, and filed the plat on March 9, 1910, in the Hillsborough County Court House, with lots for the college, the business district, two parks, and for the founding families, with only white people allowed to own or lease land in the community. Albert Dickman&#x27;s house, finished in 1910, on the banks of the Little Manatee River, is one of the few structures left standing from the founding of Ruskin.

The Millers began a new Ruskin College in 1910, with Dr. Miller serving as president and Adeline Miller serving as Vice President. Continuing with the college&#x27;s former practices, students worked a portion of each day as part of their education and as a way to pay for tuition and board. It offered three years of preparatory classes, after which students could attend the college, taking classes in art, drama, language, literature, music, shorthand, social sciences, and speech. At the peak of the college&#x27;s prosperity it had 160 students..

By 1913, the community had a cooperative general store, a canning factory, a telephone system, an electric plant supplying electricity to both public and private buildings, a weekly paper, and regular boat freight and passenger service to Tampa. With the onset of World War I, most students went to the war in Europe and the college closed its doors. In 1918, a fire destroyed the college, sparing only the Millers&#x27; house. Dr. Miller died in August 1919.

At this time U.S. Route 41 was only a shell road paid for by a $30,000 local bond issue (). Because of the growing importance of truck farming, these roads and others were built to facilitate the transportation of produce to local markets throughout the 1920s. The railroad track connected Ruskin to the Seaboard Air Line Railroad line in 1913. On the eve of the college&#x27;s demise in 1918, Ruskin had a population of 200 Ruskinites, as they are called. The majority of people appeared to have been truck growers. These residents supported a sawmill, a turpentine still, a syrup factory, a blacksmith, a newspaper, a lawyer, two carpenters, and three general stores. Rachel W. Billings served as postmaster and as the Universalist minister. With this foundation, it is not surprising that even with the destruction of the college the colony survived.
In 1925, Ruskin&#x27;s population remained at 200. It had six hotels, two sawmills, one turpentine still, a public library, the Ruskin Telephone Company, four groceries, one garage, a well driller, two restaurants, a dry goods dealer, a carpenter, and a number of fruit and truck growers. Some of the fields had been cultivated, and tomatoes, cabbages, onions and other crops were being raised. There was a nursery established for ornamentals. Thousands of palms were ready for market, and streets were being graded in certain portions of the town that lay off the highway. The community&#x27;s social life included four or five clubs organized by women, ranging from the Woman&#x27;s Twentieth Century Club to the League of Women Voters. A new school was erected, as well as a church. With the road developments auto service was provided to Brandon, Tampa, and Wimauma.

In 1930 Ruskin&#x27;s population had reached 709, consisting of 395 males and 314 females. Despite the deed restrictions against African Americans owning or leasing property, 140 black people resided in Ruskin. The rest of the population was white, of whom 514 were native and 52 were foreign-born. Three companies operated in Ruskin in 1935 despite the Depression and a drop to 600 residents: Florida Power &amp; Light Company; Ruskin Telephone, Electric Light and Power Company, Inc.; and Ruskin Trailer Company.

Because of its agricultural roots, the town weathered the Depression. The soil of Ruskin farms is especially adapted to growing tomatoes. There is a large area of muck land underlaid with marl in this region. The marl base allows irrigation of crops without loss of fertilizer, as the marl prevents the fertilizer from washing too deep into the soil. Ruskin is favored with numerous artesian wells. Due to the rapid growth of tomato culture and a cooperative arrangement among Ruskin farmers, the town was again a thriving community. It had a canning plant which employed 65 workers, a community hall, and a modern schoolhouse. As part of an attempt to attract visitors to Ruskin and to celebrate the area&#x27;s agricultural richness, the community instituted the annual springtime Ruskin Tomato Festival in 1935 where vegetables were displayed and the community&#x27;s most popular woman was voted as queen. The festival still takes place every year in May.

With many Ruskin residents working in Tampa during World War II, people from Tampa began hearing of the benefits of the rural community. Shortly after the war, Ruskin slowly became more and more suburban as people not related to the agricultural business moved into the community.

In 1960, Ruskin was still very rural. Agriculture dominated Ruskin throughout the 1970s, but its influence began to wane. The greater Ruskin area&#x27;s population reached 17,000 by 1975, many of whom were not farmers, but suburbanites. By 1982, Ruskin produced approximately of tomatoes a year, and one of the world&#x27;s largest tomato-packing houses operated in nearby Apollo Beach. However, flower farms, phosphate, real estate, and tropical fish farms also became important economic engines for Ruskin that began encroaching upon farmland. Despite this, farmers grew approximately $15 million worth of produce yearly in the late 1980s.

Poor crop yields in the mid- to late 1980s drove some farmers to the wall. Many borrowed money, sometimes as much as $500,000, against their land to plant their crops. Consequently, many farmers were forced out of business, and others chose to leave farming forever. Due to the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement in the 1990s which allowed Mexican tomatoes to flood the U.S. market and with ever-increasing water restrictions, tomato acreage continued to decline. Less than half the number of acres planted with tomatoes in the early 1990s were planted in 1997. The housing boom of the first decade of the 21st century turned most of the tomato and orange plantations into new housing development, bringing thousands of new inhabitants to the area.

The South County Coalition for Community Concerns (SCCCC) established in 1984 was a Ruskin-based Coalition comprising public and private health and human service organizations, government agencies, schools, churches and concerned citizens from South County. The history of the SCCCC (1980-2002) outlines, programs, celebrations and mutual support to bring a better quality of life to people of rural south Hillsborough County.

By 1990, changes to the downtown had occurred. The end of the traditional Ruskin Days parade (due to rising costs) and a great fire that wiped out the popular Thriftway supermarket and adjacent furniture, hardware and MC Topps department stores changed the landscape of the town center.

At present, Ruskin continues to grow with new commerce and housing developments. U.S. Route 41 is now a four-lane road connecting Ruskin to Tampa, as does Interstate 75, which has an exit at Ruskin. It had a very active chamber of commerce until 2011 when it merged with the Apollo Beach Chamber to become the South Shore Chamber of Commerce and moved from Ruskin to Apollo Beach.

Ruskin is the seat of the South Hillsborough County Government Center and has a branch of the Hillsborough County Public Library System. In 2009, the Dickman family donated the land where the new Ruskin Campus of Hillsborough Community College was erected, across the street from Earl J. Lennard High School.

==Geography==
Ruskin is located in south-central Hillsborough County, on the north side of the Little Manatee River. It is bordered to the north by Apollo Beach and to the east by Sun City Center. U.S. Route 41 passes through the center of town, leading north to Gibsonton and southwest to Bradenton. Interstate 75 runs along the eastern edge of Ruskin, with access from Exit 240 (State Road 674/College Avenue). I-75 leads north to Brandon and south to Sarasota. Downtown Tampa is to the north via I-75 and the Selmon Expressway.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Ruskin CDP has a total area of , of which are land and , or 7.80%, are water.

==Arts and culture==
===The Big Draw===
The annual BIG DRAW-Ruskin began in 2008 to mark the 100th anniversary of Ruskin as a community whose founders were influenced by the writings and philosophy of John Ruskin. It is inspired by and linked to the international Campaign for Drawing first initiated in Great Britain to honor John Ruskin. THE BIG DRAW-Ruskin celebrated the vision of Ruskin who believed in drawing as a tool for understanding and knowledge and promoted the importance of the arts in education and community life.

The 2008 Ruskin Community Mural was drawn by artist Michael Parker and The Amazing Community Mural Team. Parker with assistant Dave Bush recruited a community group of Ruskin teens and adults. The intergenerational group engaged in an intense collaboration of research, photography, and discussion of possible ideas. The final design concept was based on John Ruskin&#x27;s social ideal that human happiness requires the mix of the head, heart and hand. Mural imagery includes references to historic Ruskin, the agricultural and environmentally sensitive setting across the bay from urban centers, development and movement to future possibility. Maynard Clark donated the mural site.

The 2009 Community Mural-in-the-Round Project was coordinated by Josette Urso and the mural was painted on the Mary &amp; Martha House building. Both the 2008 and 2009 projects were commissioned by the SouthShore Arts Council and funded by grants from the John Crawford Fund of the Community Foundation of Greater Sun City Center.
