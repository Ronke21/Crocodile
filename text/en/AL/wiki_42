<text>The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is a nonprofit organization that regulates student athletics among about 1,100 schools in the United States, and 1 in Canada. It also organizes the athletic programs of colleges and helps over 500,000 college student athletes who compete annually in college sports. The headquarters is located in Indianapolis, Indiana.

Until 1957, the NCAA was a single division for all schools. That year, the NCAA split into the University Division and the College Division. In August 1973, the current three-division system of Division I, Division II, and Division III was adopted by the NCAA membership in a special convention. Under NCAA rules, Division I and Division II schools can offer athletic scholarships to students. Division III schools may not offer any athletic scholarships. Generally, larger schools compete in Division I and smaller schools in II and III. Division I football was further divided into I-A and I-AA in 1978, while Division I programs that did not have football teams were known as I-AAA. In 2006, Divisions I-A and I-AA were, respectively, renamed the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) and Football Championship Subdivision (FCS). In its 2022–23 fiscal year, the NCAA generated $1.28 billion in revenue, $945 million (74%) of which came from airing rights to the Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament.

Controversially, the NCAA substantially restricts the kinds of benefits and compensation (including paid salary) that collegiate athletes could receive from their schools. The consensus among economists is these caps for men&#x27;s basketball and football players benefit the athletes&#x27; schools (through rent-seeking) at the expense of the athletes. Economists have subsequently characterized the NCAA as a cartel. In 2021, the Supreme Court of the United States unanimously ruled that some of these NCAA restrictions on student athletes are in violation of US antitrust law. The NCAA settled a lawsuit in May 2024 allowing member institutions to pay Division I athletes who have played since 2016.

==History==

===Formation and early years===

Intercollegiate sports began in the United States in 1852 when crews from Harvard and Yale universities met in a challenge race in the sport of rowing. As rowing remained the preeminent sport in the country into the late-1800s, many of the initial debates about collegiate athletic eligibility and purpose were settled through organizations like the Rowing Association of American Colleges and the Intercollegiate Rowing Association. As other sports emerged, notably football and basketball, many of these same concepts and standards were adopted. Football, in particular, began to emerge as a marquee sport, but the rules of the game itself were in constant flux and often had to be adapted for each contest.

The NCAA dates its formation to two White House conferences convened by President Theodore Roosevelt in the early 20th century in response to repeated injuries and deaths in college football which had &quot;prompted many college and universities to discontinue the sport.&quot; Following those White House meetings and the reforms which had resulted, Chancellor Henry MacCracken of New York University organized a meeting of 13 colleges and universities to initiate changes in football playing rules; at a follow-on meeting on December 28, 1905, at the Murray Hill Hotel in New York City, 62 higher-education institutions became charter members of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS). The IAAUS was officially established on March 31, 1906, and took its present name, the NCAA, in 1910.

For several years, the NCAA was a discussion group and rules-making body, but in 1921, the first NCAA national championship was conducted: the National Collegiate Track and Field Championships. Gradually, more rules committees were formed and more championships were created, including a basketball championship in 1939.

A series of crises brought the NCAA to a crossroads after World War II. The &quot;Sanity Code&quot; – adopted to establish guidelines for recruiting and financial aid – failed to curb abuses, and the Association needed to find more effective ways to curtail its membership. Postseason football games were multiplying with little control, and member schools were increasingly concerned about how the new medium of television would affect football attendance.

The NCAA engaged in a bitter power struggle with the Amateur Athletic Union. The complexity of those problems and the growth in membership and championships demonstrated the need for full-time professional leadership.

Walter Byers, previously an assistant sports information director, was named executive director in 1951. The &quot;Harvard Crimson&quot; described Byers as &quot;power-mad&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that Byers was &quot;secretive, despotic, stubborn and ruthless&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described him as a dictator, and others described him as a &quot;petty tyrant&quot;.&quot;

Byers wasted no time placing his stamp on the Association, and a national headquarters was established in Kansas City, Missouri, in 1952. A program to control live television of football games was approved, the annual Convention delegated enforcement powers to the Association&#x27;s Council, and legislation was adopted governing postseason bowl games.

===1970s–1980s===

As college athletics grew, the scope of the nation&#x27;s athletics programs diverged, forcing the NCAA to create a structure that recognized varying levels of emphasis. In 1973, the association&#x27;s membership was divided into three legislative and competitive divisions – I, II, and III. Five years later in 1978, Division I members voted to create subdivisions I-A and I-AA (renamed the Football Bowl Subdivision and the Football Championship Subdivision in 2006) in football.

Until the 1980s, the association did not govern women&#x27;s athletics. Instead, the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW), with nearly 1,000 member schools, governed women&#x27;s collegiate sports in the United States. The AIAW was in a vulnerable position that precipitated conflicts with the NCAA in the early-1980s. Following a one-year overlap in which both organizations staged women&#x27;s championships, the AIAW discontinued operation, and most member schools continued their women&#x27;s athletics programs under the governance of the NCAA. By 1982 all divisions of the NCAA offered national championship events for women&#x27;s athletics. A year later in 1983, the 75th Convention approved an expansion to plan women&#x27;s athletic program services and pushed for a women&#x27;s championship program.

===President&#x27;s Commission===
Proposals at every NCAA Convention are voted on by the institutional members of the NCAA. Each institutional member has one representative: the president/CEO or a representative designated by him/her.
Attendance by the actual president/CEO was low; less than 30%. Southern Methodist University President A. Kenneth Pye commented, &quot;In too many cases, presidents have not only delegated responsibility, they have abdicated it.&quot; Many presidents designated their athletic director as the institutional representative, something Pye compared to &quot;entrusting a chicken coop to the supervision of a wolf and a fox.&quot;
Beginning around 1980, a group of college presidents thought there was a crisis of integrity in collegiate sports and discussed ways to 
transform athletics to match the academic model. The American Council on Education (ACE) proposed a presidential board empowered to veto NCAA membership actions, while the NCAA Council, whose membership was mostly athletic officials, suggested a presidential commission with advisory powers. The Council&#x27;s proposal may have been intended to block the presidential effort to gain control of the NCAA. The two proposals were voted on by the membership at the NCAA Convention in January 1984. The ACE proposal was defeated by a vote of 313 to 328. The Council proposal passed on a voice vote without ballots.
Publicly, the &quot;President&#x27;s Commission&quot; (PC) was responsible for establishing an agenda for the NCAA, but the actual language of the proposal stated that their role was to be a presidential forum and to provide the NCAA with the president&#x27;s position on major policy issues. The PC could study issues and urge action, call special meetings and sponsor legislation. Their one real power was to veto the selection of Executive Director. The composition of the commission was 22 CEOs from Division I and 11 CEOs each from Divisions II and III. 
The true intent of the PC was to shift control of intercollegiate athletics back to CEOs. Graduation rates were an important metric to chancellors and presidents and became a focus of the PC.

In June 1985 a special convention was held to review legislative proposals including academic integrity, academic-reporting requirements, differences in &quot;major&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot; violations including the &quot;death penalty&quot; and requiring an annual financial audit of athletic departments. All proposals passed overwhelmingly. Many presidents who did not attend sent a vice-president rather than their athletic director. University of Florida President Marshall Criser stated that &quot;the ultimate responsibility must be assumed by the CEOs because we don&#x27;t have enough NCAA cops to solve all of the problems.&quot;

The regular NCAA meeting in January 1986 presented proposals in regard to college eligibility, drug testing, and basketball competition limits. All passed but matters regarding acceptable academic progress, special-admissions and booster club activities were ignored. Many presidents did not attend and it appeared that athletic directors controlled the meeting. A survey of 138 Division I presidents indicated that athletic directors did control collegiate sports. Despite a moratorium on extending the season of any sport in 1985, the extension of basketball and hockey seasons were approved. Indiana University president John W. Ryan, outgoing chairman of the PC commented, &quot;If the moratorium is vacated, it&#x27;s being vacated not by the commission, but by this convention.&quot; Following the vote, a delegate was quoted, &quot;A lot of Athletic Directors figure they&#x27;ve successfully waited out the presidents...unless the presidents fight back, NCAA reform is flat-ass dead in the water.&quot;

The PC proposed just one legislative issue at the January 1987 meeting: applying the minimum academic standards in Division I to Division II. It narrowly passed.

The PC attempted to again push the reform of college athletics by calling another special convention which was held in June 1987 to discuss cost-cutting measures and to address the overemphasis on athletics in colleges and universities. John Slaughter, Chancellor of the University of Maryland served as chairman. He stated, &quot;This represents the second major thrust since our commission was formed three years ago. The first involved academics and infractions. This will be equally momentous and more sweeping. We want to achieve a balance between athletics and other institutional programs.&quot;
Cost-cutting measures proposed included reductions in athletic financial aid, coaching staff sizes, and length of practice/playing seasons. A resolution was also floated that opposed coaches receiving outside financial compensation if outside activities interfere with regular duties. All the PC proposals were defeated, and two basketball scholarships were restored that were eliminated at the meeting in January. It was apparent that there was an open conflict between college presidents.
The president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching Ernest L. Boyer summarized the situation: &quot;There are presidents whose institutions are so deeply involved in athletics that their own institutional and personal futures hang in the balance. They feel they must resist such change because athletics are bigger than they are.&quot;

The PC sponsored no legislation at the January 1988 annual meeting, and there was not a vote of confidence.
However, a year later at the annual meeting, financial aid restrictions were proposed for specific Division I and II sports. Following extensive discussions, the measure was withdrawn and a &quot;Special Committee on Cost Reductions&quot; was formed to study the issue. Once again, a proposal from the PC was circumvented.

The President&#x27;s Commission met in October 1989 to prepare for the 1990 NCAA annual meeting. Proposals were developed to shorten spring football and the basketball season; grant financial aid based on need to academically deficient athletes; and reporting of graduation rates. Chancellor Martin Massengale of the University of Nebraska–Lincoln was then chairman of the PC insisted that graduation rate data was needed to preclude &quot;further need for federal legislation&quot; that was being proposed by Representative Tom McMillen and Senator Bill Bradley. The proposals demonstrated that the PC was intent on regaining control of college athletics and the opposition was immediate. Commissioner of the Big Ten Conference Jim Delany responded, &quot;They tend to want quick answers and you don&#x27;t solve the complexities of intercollegiate athletics. Yes, presidents are involved, but the truth is, they really don&#x27;t have time to be involved.&quot; Bo Schembechler was blunt, &quot;Unfortunately, you&#x27;re dealing with people who don&#x27;t understand. We&#x27;re trying to straddle the fence here because you still want me to put 100,000 (fans) in the stadium and the reason you want me to do it is because you&#x27;re not going to help me financially at all.&quot; In 1990, the University of Michigan head football coach and athletic director resigned his college job to become president of the Major League Baseball Detroit Tigers. Upon his departure, he predicted, &quot;In the next five years, school presidents will completely confuse intercollegiate athletics directors, then they&#x27;ll dump it back to athletics directors and say, &#x27;You straighten this out.&#x27; About 2000, it may be back on track.&quot;

Presidential turnout for the January 1990 meeting was good and many who did not attend sent a delegate to vote for the PC. The graduation reporting proposal passed overwhelmingly, and the proposal for need-based non-athletic aid passed easily. The final proposal to shorten basketball and spring football generated fierce debate. There was a motion to defer the proposal for study that failed 383–363, but the many PC members relaxed, confident of victory. PC Chairman Massengale left the meeting for other business, but during lunch, council members began lobbying and twisting arms to change votes. When the session resumed, council members began criticizing the PC and quickly executed a parliamentary maneuver to refer the proposal to the NCAA Council. Many PC members were still at lunch when a roll call vote passed 170–150. University of Texas women&#x27;s athletic director Donna Lopiano complained, &quot;The President&#x27;s Commission needs to do what it does best, and that is to macro-manage. Leave the micro-management to the various expert groups. We
will bring back solutions.&quot;
Numerous presidents were shocked, upset and angry, but the remaining PC members began their own lobbying and arm-twisting. An hour later, there was a sense that representatives who had voted against the direction of their respective presidents had reconsidered, and a motion was made to reconsider by Lattie F. Coor, president of Arizona State University. West Point Lieutenant General Dave Richard Palmer urged the vote, stating the NCAA needed &quot;to make a mark on the wall...delay is the deadliest form of denial.&quot;
 Following discussion, compromise and voting on minor issues, the reconsideration motion passed, and the third proposal was adopted with a vote of 165–156.

The President&#x27;s Commission held hearings beginning on May 9, 1991, to develop stronger academic standards.

The President&#x27;s Commission lasted for 13 years and pushed through initiatives such as restricting the size of coaching staffs; limiting how much time student-athletes can spend on their sports; and setting more demanding academic standards for Divisions I and II.
By the 1980s, televised college football had become a larger source of income for the NCAA. In September 1981, the Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma and the University of Georgia Athletic Association filed suit against the NCAA in district court in Oklahoma. The plaintiffs stated that the NCAA&#x27;s football television plan constituted price fixing, output restraints, boycott, and monopolizing, all of which were illegal under the Sherman Act. The NCAA argued that its pro-competitive and non-commercial justifications for the plan – protection of live gate, maintenance of competitive balance among NCAA member institutions, and the creation of a more attractive &quot;product&quot; to compete with other forms of entertainment – combined to make the plan reasonable. In September 1982, the district court found in favor of the plaintiffs, ruling that the plan violated antitrust laws. It enjoined the association from enforcing the contract. The NCAA appealed all the way to the United States Supreme Court, but lost in 1984 in a 7–2 ruling &quot;NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma&quot;. (If the television contracts the NCAA had with ABC, CBS, and ESPN had remained in effect for the 1984 season, they would have generated some $73.6 million for the association and its members.)

===Late 1990s===
In 1999, the NCAA was sued for discriminating against female athletes under Title IX for systematically giving men in graduate school more waivers than a woman to participate in college sports. In &quot;National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Smith&quot;, 525 U.S. 459 (1999) the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the NCAA was not subject to that law, without reviewing the merits of the discrimination claim.

Over the last two decades recruiting international athletes has become a growing trend among NCAA institutions. For example, most German athletes outside of Germany are based at US universities. For many European athletes, the American universities are the only option to pursue an academic and athletic career at the same time. Many of these students come to the US with high academic expectations and aspirations.

In 2009, Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada, became the NCAA&#x27;s first non-US member institution, joining Division II. In 2018, Division II membership approved allowing schools from Mexico to apply for membership; CETYS of Tijuana, Baja California expressed significant interest in joining at the time.

In 2014, the NCAA set a record high of $989 million in net revenue. Just shy of $1 billion, it is among the highest of all large sports organizations.

During the NCAA&#x27;s 2022 annual convention, the membership ratified a new version of the organization&#x27;s constitution. The new constitution dramatically simplifies a rulebook that many college sports leaders saw as increasingly bloated.

It also reduces the size of the NCAA Board of Governors from 20 to 9, and guarantees that current and former athletes have voting representation on both the NCAA board and the governing bodies of each NCAA division. The new constitution was the first step in a reorganization process in which each division will have the right to set its own rules, with no approval needed from the rest of the NCAA membership.

===Notable court cases===
* In the late-1940s, there were only two colleges in the country, Notre Dame and Pennsylvania, with national TV contracts, a considerable source of revenue. In 1951, the NCAA voted to prohibit any live TV broadcast of college football games during the season. No sooner had the NCAA voted to ban television than public outcry forced it to retreat. Instead, the NCAA voted to restrict the number of televised games for each team to stop the slide in gate attendance. University of Pennsylvania president Harold Stassen defied the monopoly and renewed its contract with ABC. Eventually, Penn dropped its suit when the NCAA, refusing Penn&#x27;s request that the U.S. Attorney General rule on the legality of the NCAA&#x27;s restrictive plan, threatened to expel the university from the association. Notre Dame continued televising its games through 1953, working around the ban by filming its games, then broadcasting them the next evening.
*In 1957, the Colorado Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit filed by the family of deceased Trinidad College football player Ray Herbert Dennison. Despite suffering a lethal concussion injury on the field in a game versus Fort Lewis A&amp;M College, Dennison was not entitled to any compensation because he was not under a contractual obligation to play football. Furthermore, the court stated that the &quot;college did not receive a direct benefit from the activities, since the college was not in the football business and received no benefit from this field of recreation&quot;.
* In 1977, prompted partly by the Tarkanian Case, the US Congress initiated an investigation into the NCAA. It, combined with Tarkanian&#x27;s case, forced the NCAA&#x27;s internal files into the public record.
* In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;NCAA v. Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma&quot; that the NCAA&#x27;s complete control of television rights violated the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts, paving the way for schools and conferences to independently make deals with TV broadcasters directly.
* In 1998, the NCAA settled a $2.5 million lawsuit filed by former UNLV basketball coach, Jerry Tarkanian. Tarkanian sued the NCAA after he was forced to resign from UNLV, where he had been head coach from 1973 to 1992. The suit claimed the agency singled him out, penalizing the university&#x27;s basketball program three times in that span. Tarkanian said, &quot;They can never, ever, make up for all the pain and agony they caused me. All I can say is that for 25 years they beat the hell out of me&quot;. The NCAA said that it regretted the long battle and it now has more understanding of Tarkanian&#x27;s position and that the case has changed the enforcement process for the better.
* In 1999, the NCAA was sued for discriminating against female athletes under Title IX for systematically giving men in graduate school more waivers than women to participate in college sports. In &quot;National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Smith&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the NCAA was not subject to that law, without reviewing the merits of the discrimination claim.
* In 2007, the case of &quot;White et al. v. NCAA, No. CV 06-999-RGK&quot; (C.D. Cal. September 20, 2006) was brought by former NCAA student-athletes Jason White, Brian Pollack, Jovan Harris, and Chris Craig as a class action lawsuit. They argued that the NCAA&#x27;s current limits on a full scholarship or grant-in-aid was a violation of federal antitrust laws. Their reasoning was that in the absence of such a limit, NCAA member schools would be free to offer any financial aid packages they desired to recruit student athletes. The NCAA settled before a ruling by the court, by agreeing to set up the Former Student-Athlete Fund to &quot;assist qualified candidates applying for receipt of career development expenses and/or reimbursement of educational expenses under the terms of the agreement with plaintiffs in a federal antitrust lawsuit.&quot;
* In 2013, Jay Bilas claimed that the NCAA was taking advantage of individual players through jersey sales in its store. Specifically, he typed the names of several top college football players, Tajh Boyd, Teddy Bridgewater, Jadeveon Clowney, Johnny Manziel, and A. J. McCarron, into the search engine of the NCAA&#x27;s official online store. The search results returned corresponding numbered team jerseys. The NCAA subsequently removed the team jerseys listed on its site. 
* In March 2014, four players filed a class action antitrust lawsuit (&quot;O&#x27;Bannon v. NCAA&quot;), alleging that the NCAA and its five dominant conferences are an &quot;unlawful cartel&quot;. The suit charges that NCAA caps on the value of athletic scholarships have &quot;illegally restricted the earning power of football and men&#x27;s basketball players while making billions off their labor&quot;. Tulane University Sports Law Program Director Gabe Feldman called the suit &quot;an instantly credible threat to the NCAA&quot;. On September 30, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that limiting compensation to the cost of an athlete&#x27;s attendance at a university was sufficient. It simultaneously ruled against a federal judge&#x27;s proposal to pay student athletes $5,000 per year in deferred compensation.
*In August 2015, the National Labor Relations Board reversed a decision settled in the prior year that classified members of Northwestern University&#x27;s scholarship football players as employees, thus, granting them the right to collectively bargain for their rights. The unionization efforts were a direct effort led by the College Athletes Player Association and Kain Colter, who operated with the support of the United Steelworkers group. The case was ultimately struck down due to difficulties in applying the ruling across both public and private institutions. The NCAA made several improvements to the value of athletic scholarships and the quality of healthcare coverage in response to this movement by the Northwestern football players. These reforms included guaranteeing the entire four years of scholarship in the event of a career-ending injury, the implementation of &quot;cost of attendance&quot; stipends, the institution of &quot;unlimited&quot; athlete meal plans, and protections for the name, image, and likeness of athletes by third parties such as Electronic Arts.
*In 2018, former UCF kicker Donald De La Haye filed a lawsuit alleging that the university violated his First Amendment rights when it rescinded his full athletic scholarship over the income De La Haye made from his monetized YouTube channel, which he started before he attended college. UCF argued De La Haye violated the NCAA policy forbidding student-athletes from using their likenesses to make money. De La Haye ultimately settled with UCF so that he could obtain his degree from the university.
*In June 2021, the Supreme Court of the United States unanimously affirmed a ruling in &quot;NCAA v. Alston&quot; that provides for an incremental increase in how college athletes can be compensated. Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote the court&#x27;s opinion, which upheld a district court judge&#x27;s decision that the NCAA was violating antitrust law by placing limits on the education-related benefits that schools can provide to athletes. The decision allows schools to provide their athletes with unlimited compensation as long as it is some way connected to their education. The idea that college athletes should not be paid, a fundamental tenet of the 115-year-old NCAA, has faced increasing scrutiny in recent years. Federal antitrust lawsuits have slowly eroded strict amateurism rules during the past decade.

==Headquarters==
The modern era of the NCAA began in July 1955 when its executive director, Kansas City, Missouri native Walter Byers, moved the organization&#x27;s headquarters from the LaSalle Hotel in Chicago (where its offices were shared by the headquarters of the Big Ten Conference) to the Fairfax Building in Downtown Kansas City. The move was intended to separate the NCAA from the direct influence of any individual conference and keep it centrally located.

The Fairfax was a block from Municipal Auditorium which had hosted men&#x27;s basketball Final Four games in 1940, 1941, and 1942. After Byers moved the headquarters to Kansas City, the championships would be held in Municipal Auditorium in 1953, 1954, 1955, 1957, 1961, and 1964. The Fairfax office consisted of three rooms with no air conditioning. Byers&#x27; staff consisted of four people: an assistant, two secretaries, and a bookkeeper.

In 1964, the NCAA moved three blocks away to offices in the Midland Theatre, moving again in 1973 to a $1.2 million building on on Shawnee Mission Parkway in suburban Mission, Kansas. In 1989, the organization moved farther south to Overland Park, Kansas. The new building was on and had of space.

The NCAA was dissatisfied with its Johnson County, Kansas suburban location, noting that its location on the southern edges of the Kansas City suburbs was more than 40 minutes from Kansas City International Airport. They also noted that the suburban location was not drawing visitors to its new visitors&#x27; center.

In 1997, it asked for bids for a new headquarters. Various cities competed for a new headquarters with the two finalists being Kansas City and Indianapolis. Kansas City proposed to relocate the NCAA back downtown near the Crown Center complex and would locate the visitors&#x27; center in Union Station. However, Kansas City&#x27;s main sports venue at the time, Kemper Arena, was nearly 23 years old. Indianapolis argued that it was in fact more central than Kansas City in that two-thirds of the members are east of the Mississippi River. The 50,000-seat RCA Dome (since replaced by the larger Lucas Oil Stadium) far eclipsed 19,500-seat Kemper Arena. In 1999, the NCAA moved its 300-member staff to its new headquarters in the White River State Park in a four-story facility on the west edge of downtown Indianapolis, Indiana. Adjacent to the headquarters is the NCAA Hall of Champions.

==Structure==
The NCAA&#x27;s Board of Governors (formerly known as the Executive Committee) is the main body within the NCAA. This body elects the NCAA&#x27;s president.

The NCAA&#x27;s legislative structure is broken down into cabinets and committees, consisting of various representatives of its member schools. These may be broken down further into sub-committees. The legislation is then passed on to the Management Council, which oversees all the cabinets and committees, and also includes representatives from the schools, such as athletic directors and faculty advisers. Management Council legislation goes on to the Board of Directors, which consists of school presidents, for final approval. The NCAA national office staff provides support by acting as guides, liaisons, researchers, and by managing public and media relations.

The NCAA runs the officiating software company ArbiterSports, based in Sandy, Utah, a joint venture between two subsidiaries of the NCAA, Arbiter LLC and eOfficials LLC. The NCAA&#x27;s stated objective for the venture is to help improve the fairness, quality, and consistency of officiating across amateur athletics.

===Presidents of the NCAA===
The NCAA had no full-time administrator until 1951, when Walter Byers was appointed executive director. In 1998, the title was changed to president.
* Walter Byers 1951–1988 (Executive Director)
* James Frank 1981–1983 (Executive Director)
* Dick Schultz 1988–1993 
* Judith Sweet 1991–1993 
* Cedric Dempsey 1994–2002
* Myles Brand 2003–2009
* Jim Isch 2009–2010 (interim)
* Mark Emmert 2010–2023
* Charlie Baker 2023–present

=== Chief medical officer ===
In 2013, the NCAA hired Brian Hainline as its first chief medical officer.

===Division history===
Before 1957, all NCAA sports used a single division of competition. In 1957 the NCAA split into two divisions for men&#x27;s basketball only, with major programs making up the University Division and smaller programs making up the College Division. The names could be confusing, as some schools with &quot;University&quot; in their name still competed in the College Division while some with &quot;College&quot; in their name competed in the University Division. The split gradually took hold in other sports as well. Records from before the split were inherited by the University Division.

In 1973 the College Division split up between teams that wanted to grant athletic scholarships (becoming Division II, which inherited the College Division&#x27;s records and history) and teams that did not (becoming Division III), and the University Division was renamed to Division I. Division I split into two subdivisions for football only in 1978 (though both still under the Division I name), with Division I-A consisting of major teams who would continue to compete in bowl games and use various polls to decide its champion and Division I-AA consisting of smaller teams who would compete in the new NCAA Football Tournament to decide its champion. Division I schools without football teams were known as Division I-AAA. In 2006, Division I-A became the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), Division I-AA became the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS), and Division I-AAA became Division I non-football. The changes were in name only with no significant structural differences to the organization.
==== &quot;National Collegiate&quot; sports ====
For some less-popular sports, the NCAA does not separate teams into their usual divisions and instead holds only one tournament to decide a single national champion between all three divisions (except for women&#x27;s ice hockey and men&#x27;s indoor volleyball, where the National Collegiate championship only features teams from Division I and Division II and a separate championship is contested for only Division III). The 11 sports which use the National Collegiate format, also called the single-division format, are women&#x27;s bowling, fencing, men&#x27;s gymnastics, women&#x27;s gymnastics, women&#x27;s ice hockey, rifle, skiing, men&#x27;s indoor volleyball, women&#x27;s beach volleyball, men&#x27;s water polo, and women&#x27;s water polo. Women&#x27;s wrestling will become the 12th such championship sport in the 2025–26 school year. The NCAA considers a National Collegiate title equivalent to a Division I title even if the champion is primarily a member of Division II or III. These championships are largely dominated by teams that are otherwise members of Division I, but current non-Division I teams have won 40 National Collegiate championships since the University Division/College Division split as of 2022 (2 in bowling, 20 in fencing, 8 in women&#x27;s ice hockey, and 10 in rifle). Division III schools are allowed to grant athletic scholarships to students who compete in National Collegiate sports, though most do not.

Men&#x27;s ice hockey uses a similar but not identical &quot;National Collegiate&quot; format as women&#x27;s ice hockey and men&#x27;s indoor volleyball (Division III has its own championship but several Division III teams compete in Division I for men&#x27;s ice hockey), but its top-level championship is branded as a &quot;Division I&quot; championship. While the NCAA has not explained why it is the only sport with this distinction, the NCAA held a separate Division II championship from 1978 to 1984 and again from 1993 to 1999. As of 2024, 12 Division I men&#x27;s ice hockey championships have been won by current non-Division I teams since the University Division/College Division split. Like with National Collegiate sports, schools that are otherwise members of Division III who compete in Division I for men&#x27;s ice hockey are allowed to grant athletic scholarships for the sport.

All sports used the National Collegiate format until 1957, when the NCAA was split into the University Division and College Division (which itself was split into Divisions II and III in 1973). The only sport that immediately saw a change after the 1957 split was men&#x27;s basketball; all other sports continued to use the National Collegiate format for at least one season, and usually many more. Some sports that began after the split once used the format and no longer do. This include men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse, women&#x27;s rowing, women&#x27;s soccer, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s indoor track &amp; field.

Some sports, including men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf, men&#x27;s ice hockey, men&#x27;s lacrosse, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s soccer used to have a combined championship between Divisions II and III, but these were known as a &quot;Division II/III championship&quot; in most cases. The NCAA considered these titles equivalent to a Division II title. No sport currently uses this format.

==Player eligibility==
The NCAA requires all of its athletes to be amateurs. All incoming athletes must be certified as amateurs. To remain eligible, athletes must not sign contract with sports clubs, earn a salary playing a sport, try out for professional sports, or enter into agreements with agents.

To participate in college athletics in their freshman year, the NCAA requires that students meet three criteria: having graduated from high school, be completing the minimum required academic courses, and having qualifying grade-point average (GPA).

The 16 academic credits are four courses in English, two courses in math, two classes in social science, two in natural or physical science, and one additional course in English, math, natural or physical science, or another academic course such as a foreign language.

To meet the Division I requirements for grade point average, the lowest possible high school GPA a student may have to be eligible with to play in their freshman year is a 2.30 (2.20 for Division II or III), but they are allowed to play beginning in their second year with a GPA of 2.00.

As of the 2017–18 school year, a high school student may sign a letter of intent to enter and play football for a Division I or Division II college in either of two periods. The first, introduced in 2017–18, is a three-day period in mid-December, coinciding with the first three days of the previously existing signing period for junior college players. The second period, which before 2017 was the only one allowed for signings of high school players, starts on the first Wednesday in February. In August 2011, the NCAA announced plans to raise academic requirements for postseason competition, including its two most prominent competitions, football&#x27;s now-defunct Bowl Championship Series (replaced in 2014 by the College Football Playoff) and the Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament; the new requirement, which are based on an &quot;Academic Progress Rate&quot; (APR) that measures retention and graduation rates, and is calculated on a four-year, rolling basis. The changes raise the rate from 900 to 930, which represents a 50% graduation rate.

Student-athletes can accept prize money from tournaments or competitions if they do not exceed the total expenses from the event. For example, during high school, D1 tennis players may take up to $10,000 in total prize money. If the student surpassed the amount of $10,000 of prize money in a calendar year, they would lose eligibility.

Students are only allowed to compete athletically for four years. Athletes are allowed to sit out a year while still attending school but not lose a year of eligibility by redshirting. In other words, a student has five years from the time they begin college to play four seasons before getting drafted to professional sports teams.

==NCAA sponsored sports==
The NCAA currently awards 90 national championships yearly – 46 women&#x27;s, 41 men&#x27;s, and 3 coed championships for fencing, rifle, and skiing. Sports sanctioned by the NCAA include the following: basketball, baseball (men), track and field, softball (women), football (men), cross country, field hockey (women), bowling (women), golf, fencing (coeducational), lacrosse, soccer, gymnastics, rowing (women), swimming and diving, beach volleyball (women), volleyball, ice hockey, water polo, rifle (coeducational), tennis, skiing (coeducational), and wrestling (men).

The newest sport to be officially sanctioned is women&#x27;s wrestling, which will hold its first official championship in winter 2026. Before then, the last sport to have been officially sanctioned was beach volleyball, which held its first championship in spring 2016. The NCAA had called the sport &quot;sand volleyball&quot; until June 23, 2015, when it announced that it would use the internationally recognized name of &quot;beach volleyball&quot;.

The Football Bowl Subdivision of Division I determines its own champion separately from the NCAA via the College Football Playoff; this is not an official NCAA championship (see below).

The NCAA awards championships in the sports listed below. For the three coeducational championships, women&#x27;s dates reflect the first championship that was open to women.

* In addition to the sports above, the NCAA sanctioned a boxing championship from 1932 to 1960. The NCAA discontinued boxing following declines in the sport during the 1950s and following the death of a boxer at the 1960 NCAA tournament.
* The NCAA also formerly sanctioned a trampoline championship. Prior to 1969, it was one of the events in the men&#x27;s gymnastics championship, but it was given its own championship in 1969 and 1970 before being dropped completely.

The number of teams (school programs) that compete in each sport in their respective division as of the 2021–22 academic year are as follows:

===Men&#x27;s programs===


===Women&#x27;s programs===


Notes:
===Emerging sports for women===

In addition to the above sports, the NCAA recognizes Emerging Sports for Women. These sports have scholarship limitations for each sport, but do not currently have officially sanctioned NCAA championships. A member institution may use these sports to meet the required level of sports sponsorship for its division. An &quot;Emerging Sport&quot; must gain championship status (minimum 40 varsity programs for team sports, except 28 for Division III) within 10 years, or show steady progress toward that goal to remain on the list. Until then, it is under the auspices of the NCAA and its respective institutions. Emerging Sport status allows for competition to include club teams to satisfy the minimum number of competitions bylaw established by the NCAA.

The six sports currently designated as Emerging Sports for Women are:
* Acrobatics &amp; tumbling
* Equestrian (in Divisions I and II only)
* Rugby
* Stunt (in Divisions I and II only)
* Triathlon
* Wrestling – becomes an official championship sport in 2025–26

==Sports added and dropped==
The popularity of each of these sports programs has changed over time. Between 1988–89 and 2010–11, NCAA schools had net additions of 510 men&#x27;s teams and 2,703 women&#x27;s teams.

The following tables show the changes over time in the number of NCAA schools across all three divisions combined sponsoring each of the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s team sports.

===Men&#x27;s sports===
The men&#x27;s sports with the biggest net gains during the 1988–89 to 2010–11 period were indoor track and field, lacrosse, and cross country (each with more than 100 net gains). The men&#x27;s sports with the biggest losses were wrestling (−104 teams), tennis, and rifle; the men&#x27;s team sport with the most net losses was water polo. Other reports show that 355 college wrestling programs have been eliminated since 2000; 212 men&#x27;s gymnastics programs have been eliminated since 1969 with only 17 programs remaining as of 2013.

Additionally, eight NCAA sports—all men&#x27;s sports—were sponsored by fewer Division I schools in 2020 than in 1990, despite the D-I membership having increased by nearly 60 schools during that period. Four of these sports, namely wrestling, swimming &amp; diving, gymnastics, and tennis, lost more than 20 net teams during that timeframe. As a proportion of D-I membership, men&#x27;s tennis took the greatest hit; 71.5% of D-I members had men&#x27;s tennis in 2020, compared to 93.2% in 1990.

The following table lists the men&#x27;s individual DI sports with at least 5,000 participating athletes. Sports are ranked by number of athletes.

===Women&#x27;s sports===
The women&#x27;s sports with the biggest net gains during the 1988–89 to 2010–11 period were soccer (+599 teams), golf, and indoor track and field; no women&#x27;s sports programs experienced double-digit net losses.

* Acrobatics and tumbling was not a women&#x27;s varsity sport in 1982 and the NCAA report does not include the number of teams for that year. Bowling is first listed in the NCAA report in 2020–21 with 27 teams, and so the number of teams for that season is listed in the table above.
* Bowling was not a women&#x27;s varsity sport in 1982 and the NCAA report does not include the number of teams for that year. Bowling is first listed in the NCAA report in 1998–99 with 5 teams, and so the number of teams for that season is listed in the table above.
* Beach volleyball was not a women&#x27;s varsity sport in 1982 and the NCAA report does not include the number of teams for that year. Beach volleyball is first listed in the NCAA report in 2011–12 with 14 teams, and so the number of teams for that season is listed in the table above.
* Rugby was not a women&#x27;s varsity sport in 1982 and the NCAA report does not include the number of teams for that year. Rugby is first listed in the NCAA report in 2002–03 with 2 teams, and so the number of teams for that season is listed in the table above.
* Stunt was not a women&#x27;s varsity sport in 1982 and the NCAA report does not include the number of teams for that year. Stunt is first listed in the NCAA report in 2022–23 with 2 teams, and so the number of teams for that season is listed in the table above.
* Triathlon was not a women&#x27;s varsity sport in 1982 and the NCAA report does not include the number of teams for that year. Triathlon is first listed in the NCAA report in 2015–16 with 4 teams, and so the number of teams for that season is listed in the table above.
* Water polo was not a women&#x27;s varsity sport in 1982 and the NCAA report does not include the number of teams for that year. Water polo is first listed in the NCAA report in 2000–01 with 46 teams, and so the number of teams for that season is listed in the table above.

The following table lists the women&#x27;s individual NCAA sports with at least 1,000 participating athletes. Sports are ranked by number of athletes.

* Equestrian was not a women&#x27;s varsity sport in 1982 and the NCAA report does not include the number of teams for that year. Equestrian is first listed in the NCAA report in 1988–89 with 41 teams, and so the number of teams for that season is listed in the table above.
* Wrestling was not a women&#x27;s varsity sport in 1982 and the NCAA report does not include the number of teams for that year. Equestrian is first listed in the NCAA report in 2016–17 with 4 teams, and so the number of teams for that season is listed in the table above.

==Championships==

===Trophies===
For every NCAA sanctioned sport other than Division I FBS football, the NCAA awards trophies with gold, silver, and bronze plating for the first-, second-, and third-place teams, respectively. In the case of the NCAA basketball tournaments, both semifinalists who did not make the championship game receive bronze plated trophies for third place (prior to 1982 the teams played a &quot;consolation&quot; game to determine third place). Similar trophies are awarded to both semifinalists in the NCAA football tournaments (which are conducted in Division I FCS and both lower divisions), which have never had a third-place game. Winning teams maintain permanent possession of these trophies unless it is later found that they were won via serious rules violations.

Starting with the 2001–02 season, and again in the 2007–08 season, the trophies were changed. Starting in the 2006 basketball season, teams that make the Final Four in the Division I tournament receive bronze-plated &quot;regional championship&quot; trophies upon winning their Regional Championship which state the region they won and have the Final Four logo. The teams that make the National Championship game receive an additional trophy that is gold-plated for the winner. Starting in the mid-1990s, the National Champions in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball receive an elaborate trophy with a black marble base and crystal &quot;neck&quot; with a removable crystal basketball following the presentation of the standard NCAA Championship trophy.

As of May 30, 2022, Stanford, UCLA, and Southern California (USC) have the most NCAA championships. Stanford has won 131 and UCLA has won 119 NCAA team championships in men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sports, while USC is third with 111.

===Football Bowl Subdivision===
The NCAA has never sanctioned an official championship for its highest level of football, now known as Division I FBS. Instead, several outside bodies award their own titles. The NCAA does not hold a championship tournament or game for Division I FBS football. In the past, teams that placed first in any of a number of season-ending media polls, most notable the AP Poll of writers and the Coaches Poll, were said to have won the &quot;national championship&quot;.

From 2014 through 2023, the College Football Playoff – a consortium of the conferences and independent schools that compete in Division I FBS and six bowl games – has arranged to place the top four teams (based on a thirteen-member committee that selects and seeds the teams) into two semifinal games, with the winners advancing to compete in the College Football Playoff National Championship, which is not officially sanctioned or recognized by the NCAA. The winner of the game receives a trophy; since the NCAA awards no national championship for Division I FBS football, this trophy does not denote &quot;NCAA&quot; as other NCAA college sports national championship trophies do. The playoff will expand to 12 teams starting in 2024.

=== Current Champions ===

+: The Division I FCS National Championship is the official NCAA-sanctioned football championship for Division I. The NCAA doesn&#x27;t officially endorse a national champion at the Division I FBS level but maintains a list of &quot;official selectors&quot; in their record books.
==Conferences==
The NCAA is divided into three levels of conferences, Division I, Division II, and Division III, organized in declining program size, as well as numerous sub-divisions. Most schools belong to a primary &quot;multisport conference&quot; for most of their sports. Schools may belong to different conferences for different sports.

The Division I, Division II, and Division III &quot;Independents&quot; listed below are not conferences per se; it is a designation used for schools that do not belong to a conference for a particular sport. These schools may still have conference memberships for other sports. For example, Notre Dame primarily belongs to the Atlantic Coast Conference for most sports, but its ice hockey team competes in the Big Ten Conference and its football team is an independent.

===Division I===

Among the NCAA regulations, each Division I conference defined as a &quot;multisport conference&quot; must have at least seven active Division I member institutions. These conferences must sponsor at least 12 sports, including six sports for men and six for women. At least seven active members in a multisport conference must sponsor both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball. However, a conference may operate for up to 2 years with fewer active members under a hardship rule. For non-football conferences, they must sponsor at least two men&#x27;s team sports other than basketball. Teams that consist of both men and women are counted as men&#x27;s teams for sports sponsorship purposes.

For all institutions in the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, they have additional requirements. Among them, they must participate in conference play in at least six men&#x27;s and eight women&#x27;s sports, including football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, and at least two other women&#x27;s team sports. In 2023, the NCAA added new requirements for FBS membership, set to take effect in 2027–28. At that time, FBS institutions must fund the equivalent of 210 full scholarships across all of their NCAA sports; must spend at least $6 million annually on said scholarships; and must provide at least 90% of the required number of full scholarships across 16 sports (as chosen by the institution), including football.

===Division II===

Among the NCAA regulations, Division II institutions must sponsor at least five sports for men and five for women (or four for men and six for women), with two team sports for each sex, and each playing season represented by each sex. Teams that consist of both men and women are counted as men&#x27;s teams for sports sponsorship purposes.

===Division III===

Unlike the other two divisions, Division III institutions cannot offer athletic scholarships. Among the other NCAA Division III requirements, all institutions, regardless of enrollment, must sponsor at least three team sports for each sex/gender, and each playing season represented by each sex/gender. Furthermore, a sports sponsorship rule unique to Division III is that the total number of sports that must be sponsored differs by a school&#x27;s full-time undergraduate enrollment: schools with an enrollment of 1,000 or fewer must sponsor at least five sports for men and five for women; those with larger enrollments must sponsor six men&#x27;s and six women&#x27;s sports. As in the other divisions, teams that include both men and women are treated as men&#x27;s sports for the purpose of these regulations.

==Media==
The NCAA has current media rights contracts with CBS Sports, CBS Sports Network, ESPN/ABC/ESPN+, TNT Sports and Golf Channel for coverage of its 88 championships. According to the official NCAA website, ESPN and its associated networks have rights to 40 championships, CBS to 65, TNT Sports to one and NBC&#x27;s Golf Channel to two. The following are the most prominent championships and rights holders until the 2031–32 season:
* CBS Sports: Men&#x27;s basketball (NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament, with TNT Sports, and NCAA Division II men&#x27;s basketball tournament), track and field, ice hockey (women&#x27;s division I), golf (Divisions II and III, both genders).
* ESPN: Women&#x27;s basketball (all divisions), baseball, softball, tenis, ice hockey (men&#x27;s Division I), football (all divisions including Div. I FCS), soccer (Division I for both genders), cross country, water polo, indoor track &amp; field, swimming &amp; diving, wrestling, gymnastics, fencing, volleyball, lacrosse and outdoor track &amp; field.
* TNT Sports: NCAA Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament with CBS Sports, as well as select Big 12 Conference football and basketball games with ESPN beginning in 2025.
*NBC and Golf Channel: golf (Division I, both genders).

Westwood One has exclusive radio rights to the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball Final Fours and the Men&#x27;s College World Series (baseball).

From 1998 to 2013, Electronic Arts had a license to develop college sports video games with the NCAA&#x27;s branding, which included its &quot;NCAA Football&quot;, &quot;NCAA Basketball&quot; (formerly &quot;NCAA March Madness&quot;) and &quot;MVP Baseball&quot; series. The NCAA&#x27;s licensing was not required to produce the games, as rights to use teams are not licensed through the NCAA, but through entities such as individual schools and the Collegiate Licensing Company. EA only acquired the license so that it could officially incorporate the Division I men&#x27;s basketball tournament into its college basketball game series. The NCAA withdrew EA&#x27;s license due to uncertainties surrounding a series of lawsuits, most notably &quot;O&#x27;Bannon v. NCAA&quot;, involving the use of player likenesses in college sports video games.

==Office of Inclusion==

===Inclusion and Diversity Campaign===
The week-long program took place October 1–5, 2018. The aim was to utilize social media platforms in order to promote diversity and inclusion within intercollegiate athletics. Throughout the NCAA&#x27;s history, there has been controversy as to the levels of diversity present within intercollegiate athletics, and this campaign is the NCAA&#x27;s most straightforward approach to combatting these issues.

====NCAA Inclusion Statement====
As a core value, the NCAA believes in and is committed to diversity, inclusion and gender equity among its student-athletes, coaches and administrators. It seeks to establish and maintain an inclusive culture that fosters equitable participation for student-athletes and career opportunities for coaches and administrators from diverse backgrounds. Diversity and inclusion improve the learning environment for all student-athletes and enhance excellence within the Association.

The Office of Inclusion will provide or enable programming and education, which sustains foundations of a diverse and inclusive culture across dimensions of diversity including but not limited to age, race, sex, class, national origin, creed, educational background, religion, gender identity, disability, gender expression, geographical location, income, marital status, parental status, sexual orientation and work experiences.

This statement was adopted by the NCAA Executive Committee in April 2010, and amended by the NCAA Board of Governors in April 2017.

====Gender equity and Title IX====
While no concrete criteria are given as to a state of gender equity on campuses, an athletics program is considered gender equitable when both women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s sports programs reach a consensus.

The basis of Title IX, when amended in 1972 to the 1964 Civil Rights Act, criminalized discrimination on the basis of sex. This plays into intercollegiate athletics in that it helps to maintain gender equity and inclusion in intercollegiate athletics. The NCAA provides many resources to provide information and enforce this amendment.

The NCAA has kept these core values central to its decisions regarding the allocation of championship bids. In April 2016, the Board of Governors announced new requirements for host cities that include protection against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity for all people involved in the event. This decision was prompted by several states passing laws that permit discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity in accordance with religious beliefs.

====LGBTQ====
The LGBTQ community has been under scrutiny and controversy in the public eye of collegiate athletics, but the NCAA has gradually liberalised its policy on them. The NCAA provides many resources concerning the education of the college community on this topic and policies in order to foster diversity. Title IX protects the transgender community within intercollegiate athletics and on college campuses.

On January 19, 2022, the NCAA approved a new policy for transgender athletes, effective immediately, and this replaced their previous policy, which was in place since 2011. Now, the participation of transgender athletes in a particular sport is generally to be governed by the rules of the sport&#x27;s national governing body, international federation policy, or International Olympic Committee policy criteria (though an NCAA committee may provide its own recommendation). This action prompted immediate critique from LGBTQ advocates, including Athlete Ally and former NCAA LGBTQ OneTeam facilitator Rhea Debussy.

Previously, the NCAA used testosterone levels to qualify transgender athletes for participation. A transgender male student-athlete was not allowed to compete on a male sports team unless they had undergone medical treatment of testosterone for gender transition, and a transgender female student-athlete was not allowed to compete on a women&#x27;s sports team until completing one calendar year of testosterone suppression treatment. Under this policy, transgender males were ineligible to compete on a women&#x27;s team, and transgender females were ineligible to compete on a men&#x27;s team, without changing the team&#x27;s status to be a mixed team. In December 2021, John Lohn, the editor-in-chief of Swimming World, criticised NCAA policy; writing about transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, he argued that the &quot;one-year suppressant requirement is not nearly stringent enough to create a level playing field between Thomas and the biological females against whom she is racing&quot;.

In 2010, the NCAA Executive Committee announced its support and commitment to diversity, inclusion, and gender equality among its student-athletes, coaches, and administrators. The statement included the NCAA&#x27;s commitment to ensuring that all students have equal opportunities to achieve their academic goals, and coaches and administrators have equal opportunities for career development in a climate of respect. In 2012, the LGBTQ Subcommittee of the NCAA association-wide Committee on Women&#x27;s Athletics and the Minority Opportunities and Interests Committee commissioned &quot;Champions of Respect,&quot; a document that provides resources and advocacy that promotes inclusion and equality for LGBTQ student-athletes, coaches, administrators and all others associated with intercollegiate athletics&quot;.&quot; This resource uses guides from the Women&#x27;s Sports Foundation It Takes a Team! project for addressing issues related to LGBTQ equality in intercollegiate athletics. The document provides information on specific issues LGBTQ sportspeople face, similarities and differences of these issues on women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s teams, policy recommendations and best practices, and legal resources and court cases.

The NCAA expressed concern over Indiana&#x27;s Religious Freedom Restoration Act that allows businesses to discriminate against people based on their sexual orientation. This bill was proposed just before Indianapolis was set to host the 2015 Men&#x27;s Basketball Final Four tournament. The bill clashed with the NCAA core values of inclusion and equality, and forced the NCAA to consider moving events out of Indiana. Under pressure from across the nation and fearing the economic loss of being banned from hosting NCAA events, the governor of Indiana, Mike Pence, revised the bill so that businesses could not discriminate based on sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability. The NCAA accepted the revised bill and continues to host events in Indiana. The bill was enacted into law on July 1, 2015.

On September 12, 2016, the NCAA announced that it would pull all seven planned championship events out of North Carolina for the 2016–2017 academic year. This decision was a response to the state passing the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act (H.B. 2) on March 23, 2016. This law requires people to use public restrooms that correspond with their sex assigned at birth and stops cities from passing laws that protect against discrimination towards gay and transgender people. The NCAA Board of Governors determined that this law would make ensuring an inclusive atmosphere in the host communities challenging, and relocating these championship events best reflects the association&#x27;s commitment to maintaining an environment that is consistent with its core values. North Carolina has lost the opportunity to host the 2018 Final Four Tournament which was scheduled to be in Charlotte, but is relocated to San Antonio. If H.B. 2 is not repealed, North Carolina could be barred from bidding for events from 2019 to 2022.

In December 2024, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sued the NCAA, arguing that allowing trans women to compete in women&#x27;s sporting events was &quot;false, deceptive, and misleading&quot; to attendees.

On February 6, 2025, the day after President Donald Trump signed the executive order Keeping Men Out of Women&#x27;s Sports, the NCAA changed its policy to limit college competitions in women&#x27;s sports to athletes who were assigned female at birth, effective immediately.

====Race and ethnicity====
Racial/Ethnic minority groups in the NCAA are protected by inclusion and diversity policies put in place to increase sensitivity and awareness to the issues and challenges faced across intercollegiate athletics. The NCAA provides a demographics database that can be openly viewed by the public.

Historically, the NCAA has used its authority in deciding on host cities to promote its core values. The Association also prohibits championship events in states that display the Confederate flag, and at member schools that have abusive or offensive nicknames or mascots based on Native American imagery. Board members wish to ensure that anyone associated with an NCAA championship event will be treated with fairness and respect.

====Student-athletes with disabilities====
The NCAA defines a disability as a current impairment that has a substantial educational impact on a student&#x27;s academic performance and requires accommodation. Student-Athletes with disabilities are given education accommodations along with an adapted sports model. The NCAA hosts adapted sports championships for both track and field and swimming and diving as of 2015.

====International student athletes====
Over the last two decades recruiting international athletes has become a growing trend among NCAA institutions. For example, most German athletes outside of Germany are based at US universities. For many European athletes, the American universities are the only option to pursue an academic and athletic career at the same time. Some of these students go to the US with high academic expectations and aspirations.

==College team name changes==
As of 2018, there has been a continuation of changing school mascots that are said by some to be based on racist or offensive stereotypes. Universities under NCAA policy are under scrutiny for specifically Native American-inspired mascots. While many colleges have changed their mascots, some have gotten legal permission from the tribe represented and will continue to bear the mascot. This Native American mascot controversy has not been completely settled; however, many issues have been resolved.

Here is a list of notable colleges that changed Native American mascots and/or nicknames in recent history:

* Stanford – Indians to Cardinals (1972); became Cardinal in 1981
* UMass – Redmen and Redwomen to Minutemen and Minutewomen (1972)
* Dartmouth – Indians to Big Green (1974)
* Siena – Indians to Saints (1988)
* Eastern Michigan – Hurons to Eagles (1991)
* St. Bonaventure - Brown Indians to Bonnies 
* St. John&#x27;s (NY) – Redmen to Red Storm (1994)
* Syracuse - Orangemen to Orange
* Marquette – Warriors to Golden Eagles (1994)
* Chattanooga – Moccasins to Mocs, suggestive of mockingbirds (1996)
* Miami (OH) – Redskins to RedHawks (1997)
* Seattle – Chieftains to Redhawks (2000)
*Colgate – Red Raiders to Raiders (2001)
*Quinnipiac – Braves to Bobcats (2002)
* Southeast Missouri State – Indians (men) and Otahkians (women) to Redhawks (2005)
* Louisiana–Monroe – Indians to Warhawks (2006)
* Arkansas State – Indians to Red Wolves (2008)
* North Dakota – Formally dropped Fighting Sioux in 2012; adopted Fighting Hawks in 2015

Others:

* Illinois – Removed Chief Illiniwek as official symbol in 2007. Athletics teams are still called Fighting Illini.
* Bradley, Alcorn State – Both schools stopped using Native American mascots but have retained their Braves nickname.
* William &amp; Mary – Adjusted Tribe logo to remove feathers to comply with NCAA. Athletics teams are still called Tribe. (2007)
* Chattanooga – removed the mascot, Chief Moccanooga and the Moccasin Shoe imagery in 1996; Kept the term, &quot;Mocs&quot;, but reassigned its representation to the official State Bird.

Of note: Utah (Utes), Central Michigan (Chippewas), Florida State (Seminoles) and Mississippi College (Choctaws) all appealed successfully to the NCAA after being deemed &quot;hostile and offensive&quot;. Each cited positive relationships with neighboring tribes in appeal. UNC Pembroke (Braves), an institution originally created to educate Native Americans and enjoying close ties to the local Lumbee tribe, was approved to continue the use of native-derived imagery without needing an appeal.

==Rules violations==

Member schools pledge to follow the rules promulgated by the NCAA. Creation of a mechanism to enforce the NCAA&#x27;s legislation occurred in 1952 after careful consideration by the membership.

Allegations of rules violations are referred to the NCAA&#x27;s enforcement staff, who monitor information about potential violations, investigate and process violations, provide notice of alleged violations, and bring cases before the NCAA&#x27;s Committees on Infractions. A preliminary investigation is initiated to determine if an official inquiry is warranted and to categorize any resultant violations as secondary or major. If several violations are found, the NCAA may determine that the school as a whole has exhibited a &quot;lack of institutional control&quot;. The institution involved is notified promptly and may appear on its own behalf before the NCAA Committee on Infractions.

Findings of the Committee on Infractions and the resultant sanctions in major cases are reported to the institution. Sanctions will generally include having the institution placed on &quot;probation&quot; for a period of time, in addition to other penalties. The institution may appeal the findings or sanctions to an appeals committee. After considering written reports and oral presentations by representatives of the Committee on Infractions and the institution, the committee acts on the appeal. Action may include accepting the infractions committee&#x27;s findings and penalty, altering either, or making its own findings and imposing an appropriate penalty.

In cases of particularly egregious misconduct, the NCAA has the power to ban a school from participating in a particular sport, a penalty known as the &quot;Death Penalty&quot;. Since 1985, any school that commits major violations during the probationary period can be banned from the sport involved for up to two years. However, when the NCAA opts not to issue a death penalty for a repeat violation, it must explain why it did not do so. This penalty has only been imposed three times in its modern form, most notably when Southern Methodist University&#x27;s (SMU) football team had its 1987 season canceled due to massive rules violations dating back more than a decade. SMU opted not to field a team in 1988 as well due to the aftershocks from the sanctions, and the program has never recovered. The Mustangs did not post a winning season until 1997, did not appear in their next bowl game until 2009, did not post consecutive winning seasons until 2011 and 2012, did not return to the national rankings until 2019, and did not win a conference title again until 2023. The devastating effect the death penalty had on SMU has reportedly made the NCAA skittish about issuing another one. Since the SMU case, there are only three instances where the NCAA has seriously considered imposing it against a Division I school; it imposed it against Division II Morehouse College&#x27;s men&#x27;s soccer team in 2003 and Division III MacMurray College&#x27;s men&#x27;s tennis team in 2005. In addition to these cases, the most recent Division I school to be considered was Penn State. This was because of the Jerry Sandusky Incident that consequently almost landed Penn State on the hook for the death penalty. They received a $60 million fine, in addition to forfeited seasons and other sanctions as well. The NCAA later reversed itself by restoring all forfeited seasons and overturning the remaining sanctions.

Additionally, in particularly egregious cases of rules violations, coaches, athletic directors, and athletic support staff can be barred from working for any NCAA member school without permission from the NCAA. This procedure is known as a &quot;show-cause penalty&quot; (not to be confused with an order to show cause in the legal sense). Theoretically, a school can hire someone with a &quot;show cause&quot; on their record during the time the show cause order is in effect only with permission from the NCAA Infractions Committee. The school assumes the risks and stigma of hiring such a person. It may then end up being sanctioned by the NCAA and the Infractions Committee for their choice, possibly losing athletic scholarships, revenue from schools who would not want to compete with that other school, and the ability for their games to be televised, along with restrictions on recruitment and practicing times. As a result, a show-cause order essentially has the effect of blackballing individuals from being hired for the duration of the order.

One of the most famous scandals in NCAA history involved Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Cam Newton of the Auburn Tigers in 2011. As a direct effect of not being compensated for his college athletics, Cam Newton&#x27;s family allegedly sought upwards of $100,000 for him to instead play at Mississippi State. This was revealed days before the conference SEC championship game; however, Cam Newton was later reinstated as there was insufficient evidence against him.

==Sponsors==
The NCAA has a two-tier sponsorship division. AT&amp;T, Coca-Cola, and Capital One are NCAA Corporate Champions, all others are NCAA Corporate Partners.

==Finances==
As a governing body for amateur sports the NCAA is classified as a tax-exempt not-for-profit organization. As such, it is not required to pay most taxes on income that for-profit private and public corporations are subject to. The NCAA&#x27;s business model of prohibiting salaries for collegial athletes has been challenged in court, but a 2015 case was struck down. As of 2014 the NCAA reported that it had over $600 million in unrestricted net assets in its annual report. During 2014 the NCAA also reported almost a billion dollars of revenue, contributing to a &quot;budget surplus&quot; – revenues in excess of disbursements for that year – of over $80 million. Over $700 million of that revenue total was from licensing TV rights to its sporting events. In addition, the NCAA also earns money through investment growth of its endowment fund. Established in 2004 with $45 million, the fund has grown to over $380 million in 2014.

===NCAA expenditures===
According to the NCAA, it receives most of its annual revenue from two sources: Division I Men&#x27;s Basketball television and marketing rights, and championships ticket sales. According to the NCAA, &quot;that money is distributed in more than a dozen ways – almost all of which directly support NCAA schools, conferences and nearly half a million student-athletes.&quot;

In 2017 total NCAA revenues were in excess of $1.06 billion. Division I basketball television and marketing rights generated $821.4 million, and &quot;championships ticket sales&quot; totaled $129.4 million. Other &quot;smaller streams of revenue, such as membership dues&quot; contributed an unspecified amount.

====Expenses by category====
The NCAA provided a breakdown of how those revenues were in turn spent, organizing pay-outs and expenses into some 14 basic categories. By far the largest went to Sports Scholarship and Sponsorship Funds, funding for sports and student scholarships under the Division I Basketball Performance Fund, expenses incurred in producing Division I Championships (including team food, travel, and lodging), the Student Assistance Fund, and Student Athlete Services. Together these top five recipients accounted for 65% of all NCAA expenditures. General and Administrative expenses for running the NCAA day-to-day operations totaled approximately 4% of monies paid out, and other association-wide expenses, including legal services, communications, and business insurance totaled 8%.

The categories:
*$210.8M Sport Sponsorship and Scholarship Funds
: Distributed to Division I schools to help fund NCAA sports and provide scholarships for college athletes.

*$160.5M Division I Basketball Performance Fund
: Distributed to Division I conferences and independent schools based on their performance in the men&#x27;s basketball tournament over a six-year rolling period. The money is used to fund NCAA sports and provide scholarships for college athletes.

*$96.7M Division I Championships
: Provides college athletes the opportunity to compete for a championship and includes support for team travel, food, and lodging.

*$82.2M Student Assistance Fund
: Distributed to Division I student-athletes for essential needs that arise during their time in college.

*$71.8M Student-Athlete Services
: Includes funding for catastrophic injury insurance, drug testing, student-athlete leadership programs, postgraduate scholarships, and additional Association-wide championships support.

*$50.3M Division I Equal Conference Fund
: Distributed equally among Division I basketball-playing conferences that meet athletic and academic standards to play in the men&#x27;s basketball tournament. The money is used to fund NCAA sports and provide scholarships for college athletes.

*$46.7M Academic Enhancement Fund
: Distributed to Division I schools to assist with academic programs and services.

*$42.3M Division II Allocation
: Funds championships, grants, and other initiatives for Division II college athletes.

*$39.6M Membership Support Services
: Covers costs related to NCAA governance committees and the annual NCAA Convention.
*$28.2M Division III Allocation
: Funds championships, grants, and other initiatives for Division III college athletes.

*$9.5M Division I Conference Grants
: Distributed to Division I conferences for programs that enhance officiating, compliance, minority opportunities, and more.

*$3.3M Educational Programs
: Supports various educational services for members to help prepare student-athletes for life, including the Women Coaches Academy, the Emerging Leaders Seminars, and the Pathway Program.

*$74.3M Other Association-Wide Expenses
: Includes support for Association-wide legal services, communications, and business insurance.

*$39.7M General and Administrative Expenses
: Funds the day-to-day operations of the NCAA national office, including administrative and financial services, information technology, and facilities management.

According to the NCAA, the 2017 fiscal year was the first in which its revenues topped $1.0 billion. The increase in revenue from 2016 came from hikes in television and marketing fees, plus greater monies generated from championship events and investment income.

An ESPN critique of the organization&#x27;s 2017 financials indicated some $560.3 million of the total $956 million paid out went back to its roughly 1,100 member institutions in 24 sports in all three divisions, as well as $200 million for a one-time payment the NCAA made to schools to fund additional programs.

The Division I basketball tournament alone generated some $761 million, with another $60 million in 2016–17 marketing rights. With increases in rights fees it is estimated the basketball tournament will generate some $869 million for the 2018 championship.

===Player compensation proposals===

The NCAA has limited the amount of compensation that individual players can receive to scholarships equal to school tuition and related expenses. This rule has generated controversy, in light of the large amounts of revenues that schools earn from sports from TV contracts, ticket sales, and licensing and merchandise. Several commentators have discussed whether the NCAA limit on player compensation violates antitrust laws. There is a consensus among economists that the NCAA&#x27;s compensation caps for men&#x27;s basketball and football players benefit the athletes&#x27; schools (through rent-seeking) at the expense of the athletes. Economists have subsequently characterized the NCAA as a cartel and collusive monopsony.

Pro-rating payouts to Division I basketball players in proportion to the size of revenues its championship tournament generates relative to the NCAA&#x27;s total annual revenues would be one possible approach, but will open the door to litigation by students and schools adversely affected by such a formula.

According to a national study by the National College Players Association (NCPA) and the Drexel University Sport Management Department, the average FBS &quot;full&quot; athletic scholarship falls short of the full cost of attending each school by an average of $3285 during 2011–12 school year, and leaves the vast majority of full scholarship players living below the federal poverty line. 
In 2020, the NCAA Board of Governors announced that they supported rule changes that would permit players to receive athletics-related endorsements from third-parties. All divisions were expected to adopt new rules relating to the use of players&#x27; names, images, and likenesses before the 2021–2022 academic year begins.

On May 6, 2021, Governor Brian Kemp signed Bill 617 into law, giving collegiate athletes the ability to profit off their Name, Image and Likeness. The University of Georgia have said they will immediately compensate their student athletes, while Georgia Tech and Georgia State University have not set anything yet.

On June 21, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court held unanimously in &quot;National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Alston&quot; that the NCAA&#x27;s restrictions on education-related payments were unlawfully in violation of Sherman Act&#x27;s antitrust and trade regulations. Though this holding did not address restrictions on direct compensation payment to athletes, it also opened the door for the possibility of future court cases concerning this matter.

The NCAA announced on July 1, 2021, that as a result of &quot;O&#x27;Bannon&quot; and numerous state laws giving college players the ability to manage their publicity, the board had agreed to new rules that removed restrictions on college athletes from entering paid endorsements and other sponsorship deals, and from using agents to manage their publicity. Students would still be required to inform the school of all such activities, with the school to make determinations if those activities violate state and local laws.

On the first day of effect for the NIL rule change (July 1), athletes such as D&#x27;Eriq King (Miami (FL) quarterback), Justyn Ross (Clemson wide receiver), Bo Nix (Auburn quarterback), Antwan Owen (Jackson State defensive end), McKenzie Milton (Florida State quarterback), Malik Cunningham (Louisville quarterback), Michael Penix Jr. (Indiana quarterback), Spencer Rattler (Oklahoma quarterback), Lexi Sun (Nebraska volleyball), Paige Bueckers (UConn basketball) and twins Haley &amp; Hanna Cavinder (Fresno State basketball), all signed deals and/or unveiled trademarks to profit off of their names, images, and likenesses. As of day one, LSU gymnast Olivia Dunne was projected to be the highest earning college athlete of 2021–22, out of both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sports.

The new NIL agreement has given student athletes big time deals and opportunities to put themselves out there and gain profit using their name, image, and likeness. For example, Ga&#x27;Quincy McKinstry, a cornerback from Alabama known since childhood as &quot;Kool-Aid&quot;, signed a deal with Kool-Aid. Not only can they partner up with companies, student athletes can get paid for other talents (i.e. singing).

Russell Steinberg in 2021 says, &quot;In addition to his prowess on the football field, where he has a shot at tying the school record for most starts, Marshall&#x27;s Will Ulmer is a talented musician who wasn&#x27;t able to earn money using his own name — until now. He had been going by &quot;Lucky Bill&quot; to avoid running afoul of NCAA regulations, but now says he is ready to book shows using his real name&quot; (Steinberg 2021). The NIL has allowed Ulmer great opportunities to further pursue his football and musician career.

Some companies have partnered up with multiple athletes and created a team of their own. Degree, the deodorant brand, started a team of 14 student athletes to help promote their brand. Degree calls this team Breaking Limits. &quot;The Unilever-owned antiperspirant brand has committed $5 million over the next five years to inspire people to break limits. The first group of athletes that Degree has selected represent a diverse range of backgrounds regarding race, gender, and sport, and their stories will be unveiled on Instagram. These athletes will also have the chance to participate in events to help their local communities&quot; (Steinberg 2021).

On May 23, 2024, the NCAA and its five power conferences agreed to allow schools to directly pay players for the first time in the 100-plus-year history of college sports. The NCAA and its leagues announced their intention to enter into a multibillion-dollar agreement to settle three pending antitrust cases. In doing so, the NCAA will pay more than $2.7 billion in damages over ten years to more than 10,000 past and current athletes. It is anticipated that each player in the class will receive an annual check worth 10% of the money they are owed. Additionally, the NCAA and its league are also set to enter into a revenue-sharing plan, which allows each member school to share up to roughly $20 million per year with its athletes.

<text>Penmanship is the technique of writing with the hand using a writing instrument. Today, this is most commonly done with a pen, or pencil, but throughout history has included many different implements. The various generic and formal historical styles of writing are called &quot;hands&quot; while an individual&#x27;s style of penmanship is referred to as &quot;handwriting&quot;.

==History==
===Origins===

The earliest example of systematic writing is the Sumerian pictographic system found on clay tablets, which eventually developed around 3200 BC into a modified version called cuneiform which was impressed on wet clay with a sharpened reed. This form of writing eventually evolved into an ideographic system (where a sign represents an idea) and then to a syllabic system (where a sign represents a syllable). Developing around the same time, the Egyptian system of hieroglyphics also began as a pictographic script and evolved into a system of syllabic writing. Two cursive scripts were eventually created, hieratic, shortly after hieroglyphs were invented, and demotic (Egyptian) in the seventh century BC. Scribes wrote these scripts usually on papyrus, with ink on a reed pen.

The first known alphabetical system came from the Phoenicians, who developed a vowel-less system of 22 letters around the eleventh century BC. The Greeks eventually adapted the Phoenician alphabet around the eighth century BC. Adding vowels to the alphabet, dropping some consonants and altering the order, the Ancient Greeks developed a script which included only what we know of as capital Greek letters. The lowercase letters of Classical Greek were a later invention of the Middle Ages. The Phoenician alphabet also influenced the Hebrew and Aramaic scripts, which follow a vowel-less system. One Hebrew script was only used for religious literature and by a small community of Samaritans up until the sixth century BC. Aramaic was the official script of the Babylonian, Assyrian and Persian empires and &#x27;Square Hebrew&#x27; (the script now used in Israel) developed from Aramaic around the third century AD.

=== Handwriting based on Latin script ===
The Romans in Southern Italy eventually adopted the Greek alphabet as modified by the Etruscans to develop Latin writing. Like the Greeks, the Romans employed stone, metal, clay, and papyrus as writing surfaces. Handwriting styles which were used to produce manuscripts included square capitals, rustic capitals, uncials, and half-uncials. Square capitals were employed for more-formal texts based on stone inscriptional letters, while rustic capitals freer, compressed, and efficient. Uncials were rounded capitals (majuscules) that originally were developed by the Greeks in the third century BC, but became popular in Latin manuscripts by the fourth century AD. Roman cursive or informal handwriting started out as a derivative of the capital letters, though the tendency to write quickly and efficiently made the letters less precise. Half-uncials (minuscules) were lowercase letters, which eventually became the national hand of Ireland. Other combinations of half-uncial and cursive handwriting developed throughout Europe, including Visigothic, and Merovingian.

At the end of the eighth century, Charlemagne decreed that all writings in his empire were to be written in a standard handwriting, which came to be known as Carolingian minuscule. Alcuin of York was commissioned by Charlemagne to create this new handwriting, which he did in collaboration with other scribes and based on the tradition of other Roman handwriting. Carolingian minuscule was used to produce many of the manuscripts from monasteries until the eleventh century and most lower-case letters of today&#x27;s European scripts derive from it.

Gothic or black-letter script, evolved from Carolingian, became the dominant handwriting from the twelfth century until the Italian Renaissance (1400–1600 AD). This script was not as clear as the Carolingian, but instead was narrower, darker, and denser. Because of this, the dot above the &quot;i&quot; was added in order to differentiate it from the similar pen strokes of the &quot;n&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, and &quot;u&quot;. Also, the letter &quot;u&quot; was created as separate from the &quot;v&quot;, which had previously been used for both sounds. Part of the reason for such compact handwriting was to save space, since parchment was expensive. Gothic script, being the writing style of scribes in Germany when Gutenberg invented movable type, became the model for the first typeface. Another variation of Carolingian minuscule was created by the Italian humanists in the fifteenth century, called by them &quot;littera antiqua&quot; and now called humanist minuscule. This was a combination of Roman capitals and the rounded version of Carolingian minuscule. A cursive form eventually developed, and it became increasingly slanted due to the quickness with which it could be written. This manuscript handwriting, called cursive humanistic, became known as the typeface Italic used throughout Europe.

Copperplate engraving influenced handwriting as it allowed penmanship copybooks to be more widely printed. Copybooks first appeared in Italy around the sixteenth century; the earliest writing manuals were published by Sigismondo Fanti and Ludovico degli Arrighi. Other manuals were produced by Dutch and French writing masters later in the century, including Pierre Hamon. However, copybooks only became commonplace in England with the invention of copperplate engraving. Engraving could better produce the flourishes in handwritten script, which helped penmanship masters to produce beautiful examples for students. Some of these early penmanship manuals included those of Edward Cocker, John Seddon, and John Ayer. By the eighteenth century, schools were established to teach penmanship techniques from master penmen, especially in England and the United States. Penmanship became part of the curriculum in American schools by the early 1900s, rather than just reserved for specialty schools teaching adults penmanship as a professional skill. Several different penmanship methods have been developed and published, including Spencerian, Getty-Dubay, Barchowsky Fluent Handwriting, Icelandic (Italic), Zaner-Bloser, and D’Nealian methods among others used in American education.

=== Handwriting based on Chinese script ===

Writing systems developed in East Asia include Chinese and Japanese writing systems. Chinese characters represent whole morphemes rather than individual sounds, and consequently are visually far more complex than European scripts; in some cases their pictographic origins are still visible. The earliest form of Chinese was written on bones and shells (called Jiaguwen) in the fourteenth century BC. Other writing surfaces used during this time included bronze, stone, jade, pottery, and clay, which became more popular after the twelfth century BC. Greater Seal script (Dazhuan) flourished during 1100 BC and 700 BC and appeared mainly in bronze vessels. Lesser Seal script (Xiaozhuan) is the precursor of modern complex Chinese script, which is more stylized than the Greater Seal.

Chinese handwriting is considered an art, more so than illuminated manuscripts in Western culture. Calligraphy is widely practiced in China, which employs scripts such as Kaishu (standard), Xingshu (semi-cursive), and Caoshu (cursive). Chinese calligraphy is meant to represent the artistic personality in a way western calligraphy cannot, and therefore penmanship is valued higher than in any other nation. Standard Script (Kaishu) is main traditional script used today.

Japanese writing evolved from Chinese script and Chinese characters, called kanji, or ideograms, were adopted to represent Japanese words and grammar. Kanji were simplified to create two other scripts, called hiragana and katakana. Hiragana is the more widely used script in Japan today, while katakana, meant for formal documents originally, is used similarly to italics in alphabetic scripts.

== Teaching methods and history ==

=== Books used in North America ===
Platt Rogers Spencer is known as the &quot;Father of American Penmanship&quot;. His writing system was first published in 1848, in his book &quot;Spencer and Rice&#x27;s System of Business and Ladies&#x27; Penmanship&quot;. The most popular Spencerian manual was &quot;The Spencerian Key to Practical Penmanship&quot;, published by his sons in 1866. This &quot;Spencerian Method&quot; Ornamental Style was taught in American schools until the mid-1920s, and has seen a resurgence in recent years through charter schools and home schooling using revised Spencerian books and methods produced by former IAMPETH president Michael Sull (born 1946).

George A. Gaskell (1845–1886), a student of Spencer, authored two popular books on penmanship, &quot;Gaskell&#x27;s Complete Compendium of Elegant Writing&quot; and &quot;The Penman&#x27;s Hand-Book&quot; (1883). Louis Henry Hausam published the &quot;New Education in Penmanship&quot; in 1908, called &quot;the greatest work of the kind ever published.&quot;

Many copybooks were produced in North America at the start of the 20th century, mostly for Business Style penmanship (a simplified form of Ornamental Style). These included those produced by A. N. Palmer, a student of Gaskell, who developed the Palmer Method, as reflected in his &quot;Palmer&#x27;s Guide to Business Writing&quot;, published in 1894. Also popular was Zaner-Bloser Method, introduced by Charles Paxton Zaner (15 February 1864 – 1 December 1918) and Elmer Ward Bloser (6 November 1865 – 1929) of the Zanerian Business College. The A. N. Palmer Company folded in the early 1980s.

Modern Styles include more than 200 published textbook curricula including: D&#x27;Nealian Method (a derivative of the Palmer Method which uses a slanted, serifed manuscript form followed by an entirely joined and looped cursive), Modern Zaner-Bloser which accounts for the majority of handwriting textbook sales in the US, A Beka, Schaffer, Peterson, Loops and Groups, McDougal, Steck Vaughn, and many others.

Italic Styles include Getty-Dubay Italic (slightly slanted), Eager, Portland, Barchowsky Fluent Handwriting, Queensland, etc.

Other copybook styles that are unique and do not fall into any previous categories are Smithhand, Handwriting without Tears, Ausgangsschrift, Bob Jones, etc. These may differ greatly from each other in a variety of ways.
The first made video for correcting messy handwriting especially for people with ADHD and or dysgraphia was &quot;Anyone Can Improve Their Own Handwriting&quot; by learning specialist Jason Mark Alster MSc.

=== Schools in East Asia ===
By the nineteenth century, attention was increasingly given to developing quality penmanship in Eastern schools. Countries that had a writing system based on logographs and syllabaries placed particular emphasis on form and quality when learning. These countries, such as China and Japan, have pictophonetic characters that are difficult to learn. Chinese children start by learning the most fundamental characters first and building to the more esoteric ones. Often, children trace the different strokes in the air with the teacher and eventually start writing them on paper.

In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, there have been more efforts to simplify these systems and standardize handwriting. For example, in China in 1955, in order to respond to illiteracy among people, the government introduced a Romanized version of Chinese script, called Pinyin. However, by the 1960s, people rebelled against the infringement upon traditional Chinese by foreign influences. This writing reform did not help illiteracy among peasants. Japanese also has simplified the Chinese characters it uses into scripts called kana. However kanji are still used in preference over kana in many contexts, and a large part of children&#x27;s schooling is learning kanji. Moreover, Japan has tried to hold on to handwriting as an art form while not compromising the more modern emphasis on speed and efficiency. In the early 1940s, handwriting was taught twice, once as calligraphy in the art section of school curricula, and then again as a functional skill in the language section. The practical function of penmanship in Japan did not start to be questioned until the end of the twentieth century; while typewriters proved more efficient than penmanship in the modern West, these technologies had a hard time transferring to Japan, since the thousands of characters involved in the language made typing unfeasible.

== Motor control ==

Handwriting requires the motor coordination of multiple joints in the hand, wrist, elbow, and shoulder to form letters and to arrange them on the page. Holding the pen and guiding it across paper depends mostly upon sensory information from skin, joints and muscles of the hand and this adjusts movement to changes in the friction between pen and paper. With practice and familiarity, handwriting becomes highly automated using motor programs stored in motor memory. Compared to other complex motor skills handwriting is far less dependent on a moment-to-moment visual guidance.

Research in individuals with complete peripheral deafferentation with and without vision of their writing hand finds increase of number of pen touches, increase in number of inversions in velocity, decrease of mean stroke frequency and longer writing movement duration. The changes show that cutaneous and proprioceptive feedback play a critical role in updating the motor memories and internal models that underlie handwriting. In contrast, sight provides only a secondary role in adjusting motor commands.

<doc id="60710" wikidata="Q211972" url="?curid=60710" title="Ferrocene">
<text>Ferrocene is an organometallic compound with the formula . The molecule is a complex consisting of two cyclopentadienyl rings sandwiching a central iron atom. It is an orange solid with a camphor-like odor that sublimes above room temperature, and is soluble in most organic solvents. It is remarkable for its stability: it is unaffected by air, water, strong bases, and can be heated to 400 °C without decomposition. In oxidizing conditions it can reversibly react with strong acids to form the ferrocenium cation . Ferrocene and the ferrocenium cation are sometimes abbreviated as Fc and respectively.

The first reported synthesis of ferrocene was in 1951. Its unusual stability puzzled chemists, and required the development of new theory to explain its formation and bonding. The discovery of ferrocene and its many analogues, known as metallocenes, sparked excitement and led to a rapid growth in the discipline of organometallic chemistry. Geoffrey Wilkinson and Ernst Otto Fischer, both of whom worked on elucidating the structure of ferrocene, later shared the 1973 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work on organometallic sandwich compounds. Ferrocene itself has no large-scale applications, but has found more niche uses in catalysis, as a fuel additive, and as a tool in undergraduate education.

==History==
===Discovery===
Ferrocene was discovered by accident twice. The first known synthesis may have been made in the late 1940s by unknown researchers at Union Carbide, who tried to pass hot cyclopentadiene vapor through an iron pipe. The vapor reacted with the pipe wall, creating a &quot;yellow sludge&quot; that clogged the pipe. Years later, a sample of the sludge that had been saved was obtained and analyzed by Eugene O. Brimm, shortly after reading Kealy and Pauson&#x27;s article, and was found to consist of ferrocene.

The second time was around 1950, when Samuel A. Miller, John A. Tebboth, and John F. Tremaine, researchers at British Oxygen, were attempting to synthesize amines from hydrocarbons and nitrogen in a modification of the Haber process. When they tried to react cyclopentadiene with nitrogen at 300 °C, at atmospheric pressure, they were disappointed to see the hydrocarbon react with some source of iron, yielding ferrocene. While they too observed its remarkable stability, they put the observation aside and did not publish it until after Pauson reported his findings. Kealy and Pauson were later provided with a sample by Miller &quot;et al.&quot;, who confirmed that the products were the same compound.

In 1951, Peter L. Pauson and Thomas J. Kealy at Duquesne University attempted to prepare fulvalene () by oxidative dimerization of cyclopentadiene (). To that end, they reacted the Grignard compound cyclopentadienyl magnesium bromide in diethyl ether with ferric chloride as an oxidizer. However, instead of the expected fulvalene, they obtained a light orange powder of &quot;remarkable stability&quot;, with the formula .

===Determining the structure===

Pauson and Kealy conjectured that the compound had two cyclopentadienyl groups, each with a single covalent bond from the saturated carbon atom to the iron atom. However, that structure was inconsistent with then-existing bonding models and did not explain the unexpected stability of the compound, and chemists struggled to find the correct structure.

The structure was deduced and reported independently by three groups in 1952. Robert Burns Woodward, Geoffrey Wilkinson, et al. deduced observe that the compound was diamagnetic and nonpolar. A few months later they described its reactions as being typical of aromatic compounds such as benzene. The name ferrocene was coined by Mark Whiting, a postdoc with Woodward. Ernst Otto Fischer and Wolfgang Pfab also noted ferrocene&#x27;s diamagneticity and high symmetry. They also synthesize nickelocene and cobaltocene and confirmed they had the same structure. Fischer described the structure as &quot;Doppelkegelstruktur&quot; (&quot;double-cone structure&quot;), although the term &quot;sandwich&quot; came to be preferred by British and American chemists. Philip Frank Eiland and Raymond Pepinsky confirmed the structure through X-ray crystallography and later by NMR spectroscopy.

The &quot;sandwich&quot; structure of ferrocene was shockingly novel and led to intensive theoretical studies. Application of molecular orbital theory with the assumption of a Fe2+ centre between two cyclopentadienide anions resulted in the successful Dewar–Chatt–Duncanson model, allowing correct prediction of the geometry of the molecule as well as explaining its remarkable stability.

===Impact===
The discovery of ferrocene was considered so significant that Wilkinson and Fischer shared the 1973 Nobel Prize in Chemistry &quot;for their pioneering work, performed independently, on the chemistry of the organometallic, called sandwich compounds&quot;.

==Structure and bonding==
Mössbauer spectroscopy indicates that the iron center in ferrocene should be assigned the +2 oxidation state. Each cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ring should then be allocated a single negative charge. Thus ferrocene could be described as iron(II) bis(cyclopentadienide), .

Each ring has six π-electrons, which makes them aromatic according to Hückel&#x27;s rule. These π-electrons are then shared with the metal via covalent bonding. Since Fe2+ has six &quot;d&quot;-electrons, the complex attains an 18-electron configuration, which accounts for its stability. In modern notation, this sandwich structural model of the ferrocene molecule is denoted as , where &quot;η&quot; denotes hapticity, the number of atoms through which each ring binds.

The carbon–carbon bond distances around each five-membered ring are all 1.40 Å, and all Fe–C bond distances are 2.04 Å. The Cp rings rotate with a low barrier about the Cp(centroid)–Fe–Cp(centroid) axis, as observed by measurements on substituted derivatives of ferrocene using 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. For example, methylferrocene (CH3C5H4FeC5H5) exhibits a singlet for the C5H5 ring.

From room temperature down to 164 K, X-ray crystallography yields the monoclinic space group; the cyclopentadienide rings are a staggered conformation, resulting in a centrosymmetric molecule, with symmetry group D5d. However, below 110 K, ferrocene crystallizes in an orthorhombic crystal lattice in which the Cp rings are ordered and eclipsed, so that the molecule has symmetry group D5h. In the gas phase, electron diffraction and computational studies show that the Cp rings are eclipsed. While ferrocene has no permanent dipole moment at room temperature, between 172.8 and 163.5 K the molecule exhibits an &quot;incommensurate modulation&quot;, breaking the D5 symmetry and acquiring an electric dipole.

In solution, eclipsed D5h ferrocene was determined to dominate over the staggered D5d conformer, as suggested by both Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and DFT calculations.

==Synthesis==
===Early methods===
The first reported syntheses of ferrocene were nearly simultaneous. Pauson and Kealy synthesised ferrocene using iron(III) chloride and cyclopentadienyl magnesium bromide. A redox reaction produces iron(II) chloride. The formation of fulvalene (the intended outcome), does not occur.


Another early synthesis of ferrocene was by Miller &quot;et al.&quot;, who treated metallic iron with gaseous cyclopentadiene at elevated temperature. An approach using iron pentacarbonyl was also reported.

:Fe(CO)5 + 2 C5H6 → Fe(C5H5)2 + 5 CO + H2

===Via alkali cyclopentadienide===
More efficient preparative methods are generally a modification of the original transmetalation sequence using either commercially available sodium cyclopentadienide or freshly cracked cyclopentadiene deprotonated with potassium hydroxide and reacted with anhydrous iron(II) chloride in ethereal solvents.

Modern modifications of Pauson and Kealy&#x27;s original Grignard approach are known:

*Using sodium cyclopentadienide:       2 NaC5H5   +   FeCl2   →   Fe(C5H5)2   +   2 NaCl
*Using freshly-cracked cyclopentadiene:     FeCl2·4H2O   +   2 C5H6   +   2 KOH   →   Fe(C5H5)2   +   2 KCl   +   6 H2O
*Using an iron(II) salt with a Grignard reagent:     2 C5H5MgBr   +   FeCl2   →   Fe(C5H5)2   +   2 MgBrCl

Even some amine bases (such as diethylamine) can be used for the deprotonation, though the reaction proceeds more slowly than when using stronger bases:

:2 C5H6   +   2 (CH3CH2)2NH   +   FeCl2   →   Fe(C5H5)2   +   2 (CH3CH2)2NH2Cl

Direct transmetalation can also be used to prepare ferrocene from some other metallocenes, such as manganocene:
:FeCl2   +   Mn(C5H5)2   →   MnCl2   +   Fe(C5H5)2

==Properties==

Ferrocene is an air-stable orange solid with a camphor-like odor. As expected for a symmetric, uncharged species, ferrocene is soluble in normal organic solvents, such as benzene, but is insoluble in water. It is stable to temperatures as high as 400 °C.

Ferrocene readily sublimes, especially upon heating in a vacuum. Its vapor pressure is about 1 Pa at 25 °C, 10 Pa at 50 °C, 100 Pa at 80 °C, 1000 Pa at 116 °C, and 10,000 Pa (nearly 0.1 atm) at 162 °C.

==Reactions==
===With electrophiles===
Ferrocene undergoes many reactions characteristic of aromatic compounds, enabling the preparation of substituted derivatives. A common undergraduate experiment is the Friedel–Crafts reaction of ferrocene with acetic anhydride (or acetyl chloride) in the presence of phosphoric acid as a catalyst. Under conditions for a Mannich reaction, ferrocene gives N,N-dimethylaminomethylferrocene.
Ferrocene can itself be oxidized to the ferrocenium cation (Fc+); the ferrocene/ferrocenium couple is often used as a reference in electrochemistry.

It is an aromatic substance and undergoes substitution reactions rather than addition reactions on the cyclopentadienyl ligands. For example, Friedel-Crafts acylation of ferrocene with acetic anhydride yields acetylferrocene just as acylation of benzene yields acetophenone under similar conditions. Vilsmeier-Haack reaction (formylation) using formylanilide and phosphorus oxychloride gives ferrocenecarboxaldehyde. Diformylation does not occur readily, showing the electronic communication between the two rings.

Protonation of ferrocene allows isolation of [Cp2FeH]PF6.

In the presence of aluminium chloride, Me2NPCl2 and ferrocene react to give ferrocenyl dichlorophosphine, whereas treatment with phenyldichlorophosphine under similar conditions forms &quot;P&quot;,&quot;P&quot;-diferrocenyl-&quot;P&quot;-phenyl phosphine.

Ferrocene reacts with P4S10 forms a diferrocenyl-dithiadiphosphetane disulfide.

===Lithiation===
Ferrocene reacts with butyllithium to give 1,1′-dilithioferrocene, which is a versatile nucleophile. In combination with butyllithiium, &quot;tert&quot;-butyllithium produces monolithioferrocene.

=== Redox chemistry ===
Ferrocene undergoes a one-electron oxidation at around 0.4 V versus a saturated calomel electrode (SCE), becoming ferrocenium. This reversible oxidation has been used as standard in electrochemistry as Fc+/Fc = 0.64 V versus the standard hydrogen electrode, however other values have been reported. Ferrocenium tetrafluoroborate is a common reagent. The remarkably reversible oxidation-reduction behaviour has been extensively used to control electron-transfer processes in electrochemical and photochemical systems. 
Substituents on the cyclopentadienyl ligands alters the redox potential in the expected way: electron-withdrawing groups such as a carboxylic acid shift the potential in the anodic direction (&quot;i.e.&quot; made more positive), whereas electron-releasing groups such as methyl groups shift the potential in the cathodic direction (more negative). Thus, decamethylferrocene is much more easily oxidised than ferrocene and can even be oxidised to the corresponding dication. Ferrocene is often used as an internal standard for calibrating redox potentials in non-aqueous electrochemistry.

==Stereochemistry of substituted ferrocenes==

Disubstituted ferrocenes can exist as either 1,2-, 1,3- or 1,1′- isomers, none of which are interconvertible. Ferrocenes that are asymmetrically disubstituted on one ring are chiral – for example [CpFe(EtC5H3Me)]. This planar chirality arises despite no single atom being a stereogenic centre. The substituted ferrocene shown at right (a 4-(dimethylamino)pyridine derivative) has been shown to be effective when used for the kinetic resolution of racemic secondary alcohols.
Several approaches have been developed to asymmetrically 1,1′-functionalise the ferrocene.

==Applications of ferrocene and its derivatives==
Ferrocene and its numerous derivatives have no large-scale applications, but have many niche uses that exploit the unusual structure (ligand scaffolds, pharmaceutical candidates), robustness (anti-knock formulations, precursors to materials), and redox (reagents and redox standards).

===Ligand scaffolds===
Chiral ferrocenyl phosphines are employed as ligands for transition-metal catalyzed reactions. Some of them have found industrial applications in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. For example, the diphosphine 1,1′-bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene (dppf) is a valued ligand for palladium-coupling reactions and Josiphos ligand is useful for hydrogenation catalysis. They are named after the technician who made the first one, Josi Puleo.

===Fuel additives===
Ferrocene and its derivatives are antiknock agents used in the fuel for petrol engines. They are safer than previously used tetraethyllead. Petrol additive solutions containing ferrocene can be added to unleaded petrol to enable its use in vintage cars designed to run on leaded petrol. The iron-containing deposits formed from ferrocene can form a conductive coating on spark plug surfaces. Ferrocene polyglycol copolymers, prepared by effecting a polycondensation reaction between a ferrocene derivative and a substituted dihydroxy alcohol, has promise as a component of rocket propellants. These copolymers provide rocket propellants with heat stability, serving as a propellant binder and controlling propellant burn rate.

Ferrocene has been found to be effective at reducing smoke and sulfur trioxide produced when burning coal. The addition by any practical means, impregnating the coal or adding ferrocene to the combustion chamber, can significantly reduce the amount of these undesirable byproducts, even with a small amount of the metal cyclopentadienyl compound.

===Pharmaceuticals===

Ferrocene derivatives have been investigated as drugs, with one compound approved for use in the USSR in the 1970s as an iron supplement, though it is no longer marketed today. Only one drug has entered clinical trials in recent years, Ferroquine (7-chloro-N-(2-((dimethylamino)methyl)ferrocenyl)quinolin-4-amine), an antimalarial, which has reached Phase IIb trials. Ferrocene-containing polymer-based drug delivery systems have been investigated.
The anticancer activity of ferrocene derivatives was first investigated in the late 1970s, when derivatives bearing amine or amide groups were tested against lymphocytic leukemia. Some ferrocenium salts exhibit anticancer activity, but no compound has seen evaluation in the clinic. Ferrocene derivatives have strong inhibitory activity against human lung cancer cell line A549, colorectal cancer cell line HCT116, and breast cancer cell line MCF-7. An experimental drug was reported which is a ferrocenyl version of tamoxifen. The idea is that the tamoxifen will bind to the estrogen binding sites, resulting in cytotoxicity.

Ferrocifens are exploited for cancer applications by a French biotech, Feroscan, founded by Pr. Gerard Jaouen.

=== Solid rocket propellant ===
Ferrocene and related derivatives are used as powerful burn rate catalysts in ammonium perchlorate composite propellant.

==Derivatives and variations==
Ferrocene analogues can be prepared with variants of cyclopentadienyl. For example, bisindenyliron and bisfluorenyliron.

Carbon atoms can be replaced by heteroatoms as illustrated by Fe(&quot;η&quot;5-C5Me5)(&quot;η&quot;5-P5) and Fe(&quot;η&quot;5-C5H5)(&quot;η&quot;5-C4H4N) (&quot;azaferrocene&quot;). Azaferrocene arises from decarbonylation of Fe(&quot;η&quot;5-C5H5)(CO)2(&quot;η&quot;1-pyrrole) in cyclohexane. This compound on boiling under reflux in benzene is converted to ferrocene.

The bis(benzene)iron(II) cation, isoelectronic with bis(benzene)chromium, is unstable against nucleophilic attack, and decomposes &quot;instantaneously&quot; in acetonitrile. It can be observed, however, in metastable nitromethane solution. 

Because of the ease of substitution, many structurally unusual ferrocene derivatives have been prepared. For example, the penta(ferrocenyl)cyclopentadienyl ligand, features a cyclopentadienyl anion derivatized with five ferrocene substituents.


In hexaferrocenylbenzene, C6[(&quot;η&quot;5-C5H4)Fe(&quot;η&quot;5-C5H5)]6, all six positions on a benzene molecule have ferrocenyl substituents (R). X-ray diffraction analysis of this compound confirms that the cyclopentadienyl ligands are not co-planar with the benzene core but have alternating dihedral angles of +30° and −80°. Due to steric crowding the ferrocenyls are slightly bent with angles of 177° and have elongated C-Fe bonds. The quaternary cyclopentadienyl carbon atoms are also pyramidalized. Also, the benzene core has a chair conformation with dihedral angles of 14° and displays bond length alternation between 142.7 pm and 141.1 pm, both indications of steric crowding of the substituents.

The synthesis of hexaferrocenylbenzene has been reported using Negishi coupling of hexaiodidobenzene and diferrocenylzinc, using tris(dibenzylideneacetone)dipalladium(0) as catalyst, in tetrahydrofuran:
The yield is only 4%, which is further evidence consistent with substantial steric crowding around the arene core.

===Materials chemistry===
Ferrocene, a precursor to iron nanoparticles, can be used as a catalyst for the production of carbon nanotubes. Vinylferrocene can be converted to (polyvinylferrocene, PVFc), a ferrocenyl version of polystyrene (the phenyl groups are replaced with ferrocenyl groups). Another polyferrocene which can be formed is poly(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl ferrocenecarboxylate), PFcMA. In addition to using organic polymer backbones, these pendant ferrocene units have been attached to inorganic backbones such as polysiloxanes, polyphosphazenes, and polyphosphinoboranes, (–PH(R)–BH2–)&quot;n&quot;, and the resulting materials exhibit unusual physical and electronic properties relating to the ferrocene / ferrocinium redox couple. Both PVFc and PFcMA have been tethered onto silica wafers and the wettability measured when the polymer chains are uncharged and when the ferrocene moieties are oxidised to produce positively charged groups. The contact angle with water on the PFcMA-coated wafers was 70° smaller following oxidation, while in the case of PVFc the decrease was 30°, and the switching of wettability is reversible. In the PFcMA case, the effect of lengthening the chains and hence introducing more ferrocene groups is significantly larger reductions in the contact angle upon oxidation.

At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Maximus and Gracchus (or, less frequently, year 541 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 213 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

*Roman legions led by Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus defeat Hanno&#x27;s Carthaginian forces in a battle near Beneventum, thus denying Hannibal much needed reinforcements.
* The Roman general, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, who is in Sicily at the time of the revolt of Syracuse, leads an army which storms Leontini and besieges Syracuse. With the help of Archimedes&#x27; ideas and inventions, the Syracusans repel his attacks by sea.
* The censors Publius Furius Philus and Marcus Atilius Regulus condemn and degrade (i.e. cause to lose rank in Roman society and politics) two groups of Romans of high rank, including senators and equestrians. The first group are those Roman officers captured by Hannibal&#x27;s forces in the Battle of Cannae who have come as Carthaginian hostages to Rome to plead for their ransom (and those of their fellow prisoners), and who then refuse to return to Carthaginian captivity when the Senate refuses to ransom any prisoners. The second group are those Romans who have advocated surrender to Carthage after the Battle of Cannae, or who have made plans to flee Rome and offer their services in Greece, Egypt, or Asia Minor.
* Romans retake Samnium

==== Greece ====
* Philip V of Macedon attempts an invasion of Illyria by sea with a fleet of 120 craft. He captures Oricum and, sailing up the Aous (modern Vjosë) river, he besieges Apollonia.
* Upon receiving word from Oricum of Philip V&#x27;s actions in Illyria, Roman propraetor Marcus Valerius Laevinus crosses the Adriatic with his fleet and army. Landing at Oricum, Laevinus is able to retake the town with little fighting.
* Laevinus sends 2,000 men under the command of Quintus Naevius Crista, to Apollonia. Catching Philip&#x27;s forces by surprise, Quintus Naevius Crista attacks and routs their camp. Philip V is able to escape back to Macedonia, after burning his fleet and leaving many thousands of his men dead or as prisoners of the Romans.

==== China ====
* Panyu (present-day Guangzhou, or Canton) is established as a city.
* Qin Shi Huang orders general Ren Xiao (任囂), commanding 200,000 troops, to conquer the kingdoms in present-day northern Vietnam.
* Qin Shi Huang orders the construction of Lingqu, the oldest contour canal.
* The Qin armies under Meng Tian campaign against the Xiongnu and other northern peoples and expand their territories along the north basin of the Yellow River. They subjugate the Luliang region, drive back the Xiongnu tribes to the northwest of the Ordos Plateau, and seize Gaoque, Mt. Tao and Beijia.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Deaths ==
* Demetrius of Pharos, Illyrian ruler
* Hieronymus, tyrant of Syracuse (b. 231 BC)

<text>Year 219 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Paullus and Salinator (or, less frequently, year 535 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 219 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Egypt ====
* Following the defection of one of Ptolemy IV&#x27;s leading commanders, Egypt&#x27;s Syrian territories are seriously threatened by Antiochus III, thus initiating the Fourth Syrian War. When the Seleucid ruler captures the important eastern Mediterranean sea ports of Seleucia-in-Pieria, Tyre, and Ptolemais, Ptolemy IV&#x27;s advisor, Sosibius, and the Ptolemaic court enter into delaying negotiations with the enemy, while the Ptolemaic army is reorganized and intensively drilled.
* The former King of Sparta, Cleomenes III, escapes from his Egyptian prison and, after failing to raise a revolt in Alexandria, takes his own life.

==== Roman Republic ====
* The Romans extend their area of domination around the head of the Adriatic Sea as far as the peninsula of Histria by the conquest of peoples who dwell to the east of the Veneti. Thus, with the exception of Liguria and the upper valley of the Po River, all Italy south of the Alps is brought within the Roman sphere.

==== Iberian Peninsula ====
* Hannibal lays siege to Saguntum thus initiating the Second Punic War between Carthage and Rome. Saguntum is an independent Iberian Peninsula city south of the Ebro River. In the treaty between Rome and Carthage concluded in 226 BC, the Ebro had been set as the northern limit of Carthaginian influence in the Iberian Peninsula. Saguntum is south of the Ebro, but the Romans have &quot;friendship&quot; with the city and regard the Carthaginian attack on it as an act of war. The siege of Saguntum lasts eight months, and in it Hannibal is severely wounded. The Romans, who send envoys to Carthage in protest, demand the surrender of Hannibal.

==== Greece ====
* The Roman Senate sends the consul Lucius Aemilius Paullus to Illyria with an army. On discovering Rome&#x27;s intent, the Illyrian leader Demetrius of Pharos puts to death those Illyrians who oppose his rule, fortifies Dimale and goes to Pharos. After a seven-day siege by the Roman fleet under Lucius Aemilius Paulus, Dimale is taken by direct assault. From Dimale, the Roman navy heads to Pharos, where the Roman forces rout the Illyrians. Demetrius flees to Macedonia, where he becomes a trusted councilor at the court of King Philip V.
* The Cretan city of Kydonia joins the Aetolian alliance.

==== China ====
* Qin Shi Huang orders his generals to capture present-day Guangdong and Guangxi.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==

== Deaths ==
* Cleomenes III, Spartan king from 235 BC to 222 BC, who reorganized Sparta&#x27;s political structure and struggled unsuccessfully to destroy the Achaean League.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Greece ====

<text>Year 215 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Albinus/Marcellus/Verrucosus and Gracchus (or, less frequently, year 539 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;).

&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==== China ====
* Emperor Qin Shi Huang orders the construction of his mausoleum to begin(source?), including the famous Terracotta Army.

=== By place ===

==== Roman Republic ====
* The Carthaginian general, Hannibal, moves his forces southward through Italy and seizes the large army supply depot at Cannae on the Aufidus River.
* August 2 – The Battle of Cannae (east of Naples) ends in victory for Hannibal whose 50,000-man army defeats a Roman force of 86,000 led by consuls Lucius Aemilius Paullus (who is killed in the battle) and Gaius Terentius Varro. 50,000-70,000 Roman troops are killed, making this perhaps the deadliest one-day battle in all history.
* A loan of money and supplies for the Roman army in Sicily is sought and obtained from Hiero II of Syracuse.
* The Roman historian Quintus Fabius Pictor is sent to Delphi in Greece to consult the Oracle for advice about what Rome should do after its defeat in the Battle of Cannae.

* The city of Capua switches sides to join Hannibal and the Carthaginian army winters there.
* After the defeat at Cannae, Roman general, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, commands the remnants of the Roman army at Canusium and saves the city of Nola and southern Campania from occupation by Hannibal.
* A Roman force of 25,000 led by Lucius Postumius Albinus is ambushed by Gauls near Litana and almost completely wiped out.

<text>Year 217 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Geminus and Flaminius/Regulus (or, less frequently, year 537 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 217 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Roman Republic ====
* Gaius Flaminius is re-elected consul with Gnaeus Servilius Geminus, in what is considered to be a rebuke of the Senate&#x27;s prosecution of the war. Flaminius raises new legions and marches north to meet the Carthaginian general Hannibal.
* Hannibal advances to the Arno River and then outmanoeuvres the army of Gaius Flaminius at Arretium and reaches Faesulae (modern Fiesole) and Perugia.
* June 21 – On the northern shore of Lake Trasimene, in Umbria, Hannibal&#x27;s troops all but annihilate Gaius Flaminius&#x27; army in the Battle of Lake Trasimene, killing thousands (including Flaminius) and driving others to drown in the lake. Reinforcements of about 4,000 cavalry from Ariminum under the praetor, Gaius Centenius, are intercepted before they arrive and are also destroyed. The Carthaginian troops then march on Rome.
* Gaius Flaminius&#x27; supporters in the Senate begin to lose power to the more aristocratic factions as the Romans fear Hannibal is about to besiege their city. The Senate appoint Quintus Fabius Maximus Verrucosus as dictator.
* Quintus Fabius Maximus begins his strategy of &quot;delay&quot;. This involves avoiding a set battle with the Carthaginians and creating a &quot;scorched earth&quot; area around Hannibal&#x27;s army. Manoeuvring among the hills, where Hannibal&#x27;s cavalry is ineffective, Fabius cuts off his enemy&#x27;s supplies and harasses Hannibal&#x27;s forces incessantly. Fabius gains the name &quot;Cunctator&quot; (&quot;The Delayer&quot;) for this strategy.
* Hannibal ravages Apulia and Campania; meanwhile the delaying tactics of Quintus Fabius Maximus&#x27; army allows only skirmishes to occur between the two armies.
* Fabius&#x27; delaying policy becomes increasingly unpopular in Rome, and Fabius is compelled to return to Rome to defend his actions under the guise of observing some religious obligations. Marcus Minucius Rufus, the master of horse, is left in command and manages to catch the Carthaginians off guard near their camp in Geronium and inflicts severe losses on them in a large skirmish. This &quot;victory&quot; causes the Romans, disgruntled with Fabius, to elevate Minucius to the equal rank of dictator with Fabius.
* Minucius takes command of half the army and camps separately from Fabius near Geronium. Hannibal, informed of this development, lays an elaborate trap, which draws out Minucius and his army and then Hannibal attacks it from all sides. The timely arrival of Fabius with the other half of the army enables Minucius to escape after a severe mauling. After the battle, Minucius turns over his army to Fabius and resumes the duties of Master of Horse.
* Carthaginians defeat the Romans at Lake Trasimene; at the Trebia River and at the Ticinus River

==== Egypt ====
* June 22 – Egyptian native hoplites under Ptolemy IV crush the Seleucid army under Antiochus III in the Battle of Raphia near Gaza. The realization of their military importance leads to demands by native Egyptians for greater privileges and so to the development of racial difficulties which will weaken the Ptolemy dynasty in the future.
* Although holding the initiative after the Battle of Raphia, Ptolemy IV, on his chief minister Sosibius&#x27; advice, negotiates a peace, and the Seleucid army withdraws from Coele Syria. Antiochus III gives up all his conquests except the city of Seleucia-in-Pieria.

==== Greece ====
*Philip V of Macedon, continuing his war with the Aetolian League lays siege to Phthiotic Thebes, captures it and sells the inhabitants into slavery.
* Learning of Hannibal&#x27;s victory over the Romans at Lake Trasimene and seeing a chance to recover his Illyrian kingdom from the Romans, Demetrius of Pharos immediately advises Philip V to make peace with the Aetolians, and turn his attentions toward Illyria and Italy. Philip, at once begins negotiations with the Aetolians. At a conference on the coast near Naupactus, Philip meets the Aetolian leaders and a peace treaty is concluded, ending the three-year-long &quot;Social War&quot;.

==== Spain ====
* Publius Cornelius Scipio is sent with reinforcements by Rome to Spain as proconsul. In a naval battle on the Ebro River at Tarraco, the Carthaginian general Hasdrubal&#x27;s fleet is largely destroyed by a daring surprise Roman attack led by Publius Cornelius Scipio and his brother Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus. As a result, the Romans are able to strengthen their hold on the Ebro River region.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

<doc id="60721" wikidata="Q424390" url="?curid=60721" title="Cyclopentadiene">
<text>Cyclopentadiene is an organic compound with the formula C5H6. It is often abbreviated CpH because the cyclopentadienyl anion is abbreviated Cp−.

This colorless liquid has a strong and unpleasant odor. At room temperature, this cyclic diene dimerizes over the course of hours to give dicyclopentadiene via a Diels–Alder reaction. This dimer can be restored by heating to give the monomer.

The compound is mainly used for the production of cyclopentene and its derivatives. It is popularly used as a precursor to the cyclopentadienyl anion (Cp−), an important ligand in cyclopentadienyl complexes in organometallic chemistry.

==Production and reactions==

Cyclopentadiene production is usually not distinguished from dicyclopentadiene since they interconvert. They are obtained from coal tar (about 10–20 g/t) and by steam cracking of naphtha (about 14 kg/t). To obtain cyclopentadiene monomer, commercial dicyclopentadiene is cracked by heating to around 180 °C. The monomer is collected by distillation and used soon thereafter. It advisable to use some form of fractionating column when doing this, to remove refluxing uncracked dimer. 

===Sigmatropic rearrangement===
The hydrogen atoms in cyclopentadiene undergo rapid [1,5]-sigmatropic shifts. The hydride shift is, however, sufficiently slow at 0 °C to allow alkylated derivatives to be manipulated selectively. 
Even more fluxional are the derivatives C5H5E(CH3)3 (E = Si, Ge, Sn), wherein the heavier element migrates from carbon to carbon with a low activation barrier.

===Diels–Alder reactions===
Cyclopentadiene is a highly reactive diene in the Diels–Alder reaction because minimal distortion of the diene is required to achieve the envelope geometry of the transition state compared to other dienes. Famously, cyclopentadiene dimerizes. The conversion occurs in hours at room temperature, but the monomer can be stored for days at −20 °C.

===Deprotonation===

The compound is unusually acidic (p&quot;K&quot;a = 16) for a hydrocarbon, a fact explained by the high stability of the aromatic cyclopentadienyl anion, . Deprotonation can be achieved with a variety of bases, typically sodium hydride, sodium metal, and butyl lithium. Salts of this anion are commercially available, including sodium cyclopentadienide and lithium cyclopentadienide. They are used to prepare cyclopentadienyl complexes.

===Metallocene derivatives===

Metallocenes and related cyclopentadienyl derivatives have been heavily investigated and represent a cornerstone of organometallic chemistry owing to their high stability. The first metallocene characterised, ferrocene, was prepared the way many other metallocenes are prepared by combining alkali metal derivatives of the form MC5H5 with dihalides of the transition metals: As typical example, nickelocene forms upon treating nickel(II) chloride with sodium cyclopentadienide in THF.

: NiCl2 + 2 NaC5H5 → Ni(C5H5)2 + 2 NaCl

Organometallic complexes that include both the cyclopentadienyl anion and cyclopentadiene itself are known, one example of which is the rhodocene derivative produced from the rhodocene monomer in protic solvents.

===Organic synthesis===
It was the starting material in Leo Paquette&#x27;s 1982 synthesis of dodecahedrane. The first step involved reductive dimerization of the molecule to give dihydrofulvalene, not simple addition to give dicyclopentadiene.


==Uses==
Aside from serving as a precursor to cyclopentadienyl-based catalysts, the main commercial application of cyclopentadiene is as a precursor to comonomers. Semi-hydrogenation gives cyclopentene. Diels–Alder reaction with butadiene gives ethylidene norbornene, a comonomer in the production of EPDM rubbers.

==Derivatives==
Cyclopentadiene can substitute one or more hydrogens, forming derivatives having covalent bonds:
* Bulky cyclopentadienes
* Calicene
* Cyclopentadienone
* Di-&quot;tert&quot;-butylcyclopentadiene
* Methylcyclopentadiene
* Pentamethylcyclopentadiene
* Pentacyanocyclopentadiene

Most of these substituted cyclopentadienes can also form anions and join cyclopentadienyl complexes.

<text>The Simputer is a self-contained, open hardware Linux-based handheld computer that was first released in 2002, developed in, and primarily distributed within India. The product was envisioned as a low-cost alternative to personal computers. The Simputer project had the initial goal of selling 50,000 units, but only sold about 4,000 units by 2005, and has been called a failure by news sources.

==Design and hardware==
The device was designed by the Simputer Trust, a non-profit organization formed in November 1999 by seven Indian scientists and engineers led by Dr. Swami Manohar. The word &quot;Simputer&quot; is an acronym for &quot;simple, inexpensive and multilingual people&#x27;s computer&quot;, and is a trademark of the Simputer Trust. The device includes text-to-speech software and runs the Linux operating system. Similar in appearance to the PalmPilot class of handheld computers, the touch sensitive screen is operated on with a stylus; simple handwriting recognition software is provided by the program Tapatap.

The Simputer Trust licensed two manufacturers to build the devices, Encore Software, which has also built the Mobilis for Corporate/Educational purposes and the SATHI for Defence purposes, and PicoPeta Simputers, which released a consumer product named the Amida Simputer.

The device features include touchscreen, smart card, Serial port, and USB connections, and an Infrared Data Association (IrDA) port. It was released in both greyscale and color versions.

==Software==
The Simputer uses the Linux kernel (2.4.18 Kernel as of July 2005), and the Alchemy Window Manager (only the Amida Simputer). Software packages include: Scheduling, Calendar, Voice Recording and Playback, simple spreadsheet application, Internet and network connectivity, Web browsing and email, an e-Library, games, and support for Java ME, DotGNU (a free software implementation of .NET), and Flash.

In addition, both licensees developed custom applications for microbanking, traffic police, and medical applications.

==Deployments==
In 2004, Simputers were used by the government of Karnataka to automate the process of land records procurement. Simputers were also used in a project in Chhattisgarh for the purpose of e-education. In 2005, they were used in a variety of applications, such as automobile engine diagnostics (Mahindra &amp; Mahindra in Mumbai), tracking of iron-ore movement from mine pithead to shipping point (Dempo, Goa), Microcredit (Sanghamitra, Mysore), Electronic Money Transfer between UK and Ghana (XK8 Systems, UK), and others. In recent times, the Simputer has seen deployment by the police force to track traffic offenders and issue traffic tickets.

==Commercial production==
Pilot production of the Simputer started in September 2002. In 2004, the Amida Simputer became commercially available for 12450 and up (approximately US$240). The prices for Amida Simputer vary depending on the screen type (monochrome or colour).

By 2006, both licensees had stopped actively marketing their Simputer devices. PicoPeta was acquired by Geodesic Information Systems (a developer of communication and collaboration systems) in 2005.

<text>Lucy Maud Montgomery (November 30, 1874 – April 24, 1942), published as L. M. Montgomery, was a Canadian author best known for a collection of novels, essays, short stories, and poetry beginning in 1908 with &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;. She published 20 novels as well as 530 short stories, 500 poems, and 30 essays. &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; was an immediate success; the title character, orphan Anne Shirley, made Montgomery famous in her lifetime and gave her an international following. Most of the novels were set on Prince Edward Island and those locations within Canada&#x27;s smallest province became a literary landmark and popular tourist site—namely Green Gables farm, the genesis of Prince Edward Island National Park.

Montgomery&#x27;s work, diaries, and letters have been read and studied by scholars and readers worldwide. The L. M. Montgomery Institute, University of Prince Edward Island, is responsible for the scholarly inquiry into the life, works, culture, and influence of Montgomery.

==Early life and education==

Montgomery was born in New London, Prince Edward Island, Canada, on November 30, 1874. Her mother, Clara Woolner (née Macneill)&lt;ref name=&quot;montyhistnotes/I9517&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Montgomery (1853–1876), died of tuberculosis (TB) when Maud was 21 months old. Stricken with grief, her father, Hugh John Montgomery (1841–1900), placed Maud in her maternal grandparents&#x27; custody, though he remained in the vicinity. When Maud was seven, her father moved to Prince Albert, North-West Territories (now Prince Albert, Saskatchewan). From then on Maud was raised by her grandparents, Alexander Marquis Macneill and Lucy Woolner Macneill, in the community of Cavendish, Prince Edward Island.

Montgomery&#x27;s early life in Cavendish was very lonely. Despite having relatives nearby, much of her childhood was spent alone. She created imaginary friends and worlds to cope with her loneliness, and Montgomery credited this time of her life with developing her creativity. Her imaginary friends were named Katie Maurice and Lucy Gray and lived in the &quot;fairy room&quot; behind the bookcase in the drawing room. Anne Shirley also named her imaginary friend &quot;Katie Maurice.&quot; During a church service, Montgomery asked her aunt where her dead mother was, leading her to point upwards. Montgomery saw a trap door in the church&#x27;s ceiling, which led her to wonder why the minister did not just get a ladder to retrieve her mother from the church&#x27;s ceiling.

In 1887, at age 13, Montgomery wrote in her diary that she had &quot;early dreams of future fame.&quot; She submitted a poem for publication, writing, &quot;I saw myself the wonder of my schoolmates— a little local celebrity.&quot; Upon rejection, Montgomery wrote, &quot;Tears of disappointment &quot;would&quot; come in spite of myself, as I crept away to hide the poor crumpled manuscript in the depths of my trunk.&quot; She later wrote, &quot;down, deep down under all the discouragement and rebuff, I knew I would &#x27;arrive&#x27; someday.&quot;

After completing her education in Cavendish, Montgomery spent one year (1890) in Prince Albert with her father and her stepmother, Mary Ann McRae (1863–1910), who had married in 1887. While she was in Prince Albert, Montgomery&#x27;s first work, a poem titled &quot;On Cape LeForce&quot;, was published in the Charlottetown paper &quot;The Daily Patriot&quot;. She was as excited about this as she was about her return to Prince Edward Island in 1891. Before returning to Cavendish, Montgomery had another article published in the newspaper, describing her visit to a First Nations camp on the Great Plains. She often saw Blackfeet and Plains Cree in Prince Albert, writing that she saw many Indians on the Prairies who were much more handsome and attractive than those she had seen in the Maritimes.

Montgomery&#x27;s return to Cavendish was a great relief to her. Her time in Prince Albert was unhappy, for she did not get along with her stepmother. According to Montgomery, her father&#x27;s marriage was not a happy one.

In 1893, Montgomery attended Prince of Wales College in Charlottetown to obtain a teacher&#x27;s license. She loved Prince Edward Island. During solitary walks through the peaceful island countryside, Montgomery started to experience what she called &quot;the flash&quot;—a moment of tranquility and clarity when she felt emotional ecstasy and was inspired by the awareness of a higher spiritual power running through nature. Montgomery&#x27;s accounts of this &quot;flash&quot; were later given to the character Emily Byrd Starr in the &quot;Emily of New Moon&quot; trilogy, and also served as the basis for her descriptions of Anne Shirley&#x27;s sense of emotional communion with nature. In 1905, Montgomery wrote in her journal, &quot;amid the commonplaces of life, I was very near to a kingdom of ideal beauty. Between it and me hung only a thin veil. I could never quite draw it aside, but sometimes a wind fluttered it. I seemed to catch a glimpse of the enchanting realm beyond—only a glimpse—but those glimpses had always made life worthwhile.&quot; A deeply spiritual woman, Montgomery found the moments when she experienced &quot;the flash&quot; some of the most beautiful, moving and intense of her life.

Montgomery completed the two-year teaching program in Charlottetown in one year. In 1895 and 1896, she studied literature at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia.

==Writing career, romantic interests, and family life==

===Published books and suitors===

Upon leaving Dalhousie, Montgomery worked as a teacher in various Prince Edward Island schools. Though she did not enjoy teaching, it afforded her time to write. Beginning in 1897, her short stories were published in magazines and newspapers. A prolific writer, Montgomery published over 100 stories between 1897 and 1907.

During her teaching years, Montgomery had numerous love interests. As a highly fashionable young woman, she had &quot;slim, good looks&quot; and won the attention of several young men. In 1889, at 14, Montgomery began a relationship with a Cavendish boy, Nate Lockhart. To her, the relationship was merely a humorous and witty friendship. It ended abruptly when Montgomery refused his marriage proposal.

The early 1890s brought unwelcome advances from John A. Mustard and Will Pritchard. Mustard, her teacher, quickly became her suitor; he tried to impress her with his knowledge of religious matters. His best topics of conversation were his thoughts on predestination and &quot;other dry points of theology&quot;, which held little appeal for Montgomery. During the period when Mustard&#x27;s interest became more pronounced, Montgomery found a new interest in Pritchard, the brother of her friend Laura Pritchard. This friendship was more amiable, but he too felt more for Montgomery than she did for him. When Pritchard sought to take their friendship further, Montgomery resisted. She refused both marriage proposals; Mustard was too narrow-minded, and she considered Pritchard merely a good chum. She ended the period of flirtation when she moved to Prince Edward Island. She and Pritchard continued to correspond for over six years, until he died of influenza in 1897.

In 1897, Montgomery received a proposal from Edwin Simpson, a student in French River near Cavendish. She wrote that she accepted his proposal out of a desire for &quot;love and protection&quot; and because she felt her prospects were rather poor. Montgomery came to dislike Simpson, whom she regarded as intolerably self-centred and vain to the point of feeling nauseated in his presence. While teaching in Lower Bedeque, she had a brief but passionate affair with Herman Leard, a member of the family with which she boarded. (Leard himself was engaged to neighbour Ettie Schurman while involved with Montgomery.) Of the men she loved, it was Leard she loved the most, writing in her diary: Hermann suddenly bent his head and his lips touched my face. I cannot tell what possessed me—I seemed swayed by a power utterly beyond my control—I turned my head—our lips met in one long passionate pressure—a kiss of fire and rapture such I had never experienced or imagined. Ed&#x27;s kisses at the best left me cold as ice—&quot;Hermann&#x27;s&quot; sent flame through every fibre of my being. On April 8, 1898, Montgomery wrote she had to stay faithful to Simpson: &quot;for the sake of my self respect I &quot;must not&quot; stoop to any sort of an affair with another man&quot;. She then wrote: If I had—or rather if I &quot;could&quot; have—kept this resolve I would have saved myself incalculable suffering. For it was but a few days later that I found myself face to face with the burning consciousness that I &quot;loved&quot; Herman Leard with a wild, passionate, unreasoning love that dominated my entire being and possessed me like a flame—a love I could neither quell nor control—a love that in its intensity seemed little short of absolute madness. Madness! Yes! In Victorian Canada, premarital sex was rare for women, and Montgomery had been brought up in a strict Presbyterian household where she had been taught that all who &quot;fornicated&quot; were among the &quot;damned&quot; who burned in Hell forever, a message she had taken to heart. Despite this, she often invited Leard into her bedroom when everybody else was out, and though she refused to have sex with him as she wanted to be a virgin bride, she and Leard engaged in kissing and &quot;preliminary lovemaking&quot;. Montgomery called Leard in her diary only &quot;a very nice, attractive young animal!&quot;, albeit one with &quot;magnetic blue eyes&quot;.

Following objections from her family and friends that Leard was not &quot;good enough&quot; for her, Montgomery broke off her relationship with him. He died shortly afterwards of the flu. In 1898, after much unhappiness and disillusionment, Montgomery broke off her engagement to Simpson. She ceased to seek romantic love. Montgomery was greatly upset when she learned of Leard&#x27;s death in June 1899, writing in her diary: &quot;It is easier to think him as dead, mine, &quot;all&quot; mine in death, as he could never be in life, mine when no other women could ever lie on his heart or kiss his lips.&quot;

In 1898, Montgomery moved back to Cavendish to live with her widowed grandmother. For a nine-month period between 1901 and 1902, she worked in Halifax as a substitute proofreader for the newspapers &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot; and &quot;The Daily Echo&quot;. Montgomery was inspired to write her first books during this time. Until her grandmother&#x27;s death in March 1911, Montgomery stayed in Cavendish to take care of her. This coincided with a period of considerable income from her publications.

===Marriage and family===

In 1908, Montgomery published her first book, &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;. An immediate success, it established Montgomery&#x27;s career, and she wrote and published material, including numerous sequels to &quot;Anne&quot;, for the rest of her life. &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; was published in June 1908 and by November 1909 had gone through six printings. A sequel was published the following year. The Canadian press made much of Montgomery&#x27;s roots on Prince Edward Island, which was portrayed as a charming part of Canada where the people retained old-fashioned values and everything moved at a much slower pace. The American press suggested that all of Canada was backward and slow, arguing that a book like &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; was only possible in a rustic country like Canada, where the people were nowhere near as advanced as in the U.S. Typical of the American coverage of Montgomery was a 1911 newspaper article in Boston, which asserted:Recently a new and exceedingly brilliant star arose on the literacy horizon in the person of a previously unknown writer of &quot;heart interest&quot; stories, Miss Lucy M. Montgomery, and presently the astronomers located her in the latitude of Prince Edward Island. No one would ever imagine that such a remote and unassertive speck on the map would ever produce such a writer whose first three books should one and all be included in the &quot;six best sellers.&quot; But it was on this unemotional island that &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; was born ... This story was the work of a modest young school teacher, who was doubtless as surprised as any of her neighbors when she found her sweetly simple tale of childish joys and sorrows of a diminutive red-haired girl who had made the literary hit of the season with the American public ...

Despite the success of the first two &quot;Anne&quot; novels, Montgomery did not have any desire to write more featuring the character, writing in a 1910 letter:I have been flooded with letters entreating me to write a third &quot;Anne&quot; book ... but I feel as if I simply could not do it. The freshness has gone out of the &quot;Anne&quot; idea. It may return some day. But unless it does I shall never throw any further light on Anne&#x27;s career. Despite her feeling the story of Anne Shirley had run its course, in 1912 she would publish a short story collection set in Avonlea (with Anne featured in one), &quot;Chronicles of Avonlea&quot;, then in 1915 a third novel in the series, &quot;Anne of the Island&quot;, followed by numerous others over the remainder of her life.

In contrast to this publisher&#x27;s ideal image of her, Montgomery wrote in a letter to a friend: &quot;I am frankly in literature to make a living out of it.&quot; The British scholar Faye Hammill noted that in the books Anne is a tall girl and Montgomery was 37 at the time, which hardly made for a &quot;young school teacher&quot;. Hammill also noted that the author of the piece chose to present Montgomery as the idealized female author, who was happiest in a domestic/rural environment and disliked fame and celebrity, which was seen at the time as conflicting with femininity. In emphasizing Montgomery&#x27;s modesty and desire to remain anonymous, the author was portraying her as the ideal woman writer, who wanted to preserve her femininity by not embarking on a professional career, writing only a part-time job at best. At the same time, Hammill noted that the author was using the anachronistic French name for Prince Edward Island, to add to the picture of a romantic, mist-shrouded fantasy island where the old ways of life continued &quot;unspoiled&quot;, just as Montgomery was portrayed as an &quot;unspoiled&quot; woman.

Shortly after her grandmother&#x27;s death in 1911, Montgomery married Ewen (spelled in her notes and letters as &quot;Ewan&quot;) Macdonald (1870–1943), a Presbyterian minister, and they moved to Ontario, where he had taken the position of minister of St. Paul&#x27;s Presbyterian Church, Leaskdale in present-day Uxbridge Township, also affiliated with the congregation in nearby Zephyr. Montgomery wrote her next 11 books from the Leaskdale manse that she complained had neither a bathroom nor a toilet. The congregation later sold the structure, which is now the Leaskdale Manse National Historic Site. Macdonald was not especially intelligent, nor was he interested in literature. Montgomery wrote in her diary: &quot;I would not want him for a lover but I hope at first that I might find a friend in him.&quot; After their marriage, she took her honeymoon in England and Scotland, the latter a particular point of interest to her, as it was for her the &quot;Old Country&quot;—the romantic land of castles, rugged mountains, shining glens, lakes and waterfalls that was her ancestral homeland.

By contrast, Macdonald&#x27;s parents had come to Canada after being evicted in the Highland Clearances, and he had no desire to visit the &quot;Old Country&quot;. His wife had to drag him to the Isle of Skye, the home of the Clan Macdonald, where the Macdonalds had once reigned as the Lords of the Isles. The Macdonalds had been Scots-Gaelic-speaking Highlanders, while the Montgomerys and Macneil had been English-speaking Lowlanders, which might explain the differing attitudes the couple held toward Scotland, as Montgomery was more proud of her Scottish heritage than her husband. In England, Montgomery visited places associated with her favorite writers, going to the Lake District made famous by William Wordsworth, to William Shakespeare&#x27;s house in Stratford-upon-Avon, and to the Haworth house in the Yorkshire moors where the Brontës (Anne, Charlotte, Emily and Branwell) had lived.

The Macdonalds had three sons; the second was stillborn. Montgomery believed it was her duty as a woman to make her marriage work, though, during a visit to Scotland, she quipped to a reporter, &quot;Those women whom God wanted to destroy He would make into the wives of ministers.&quot; The great increase of Montgomery&#x27;s writings in Leaskdale is the result of her need to escape the hardships of real life. In 1909–10, Montgomery drew upon her Scottish-Canadian heritage and her memories of her teenage years to write her 1911 novel &quot;The Story Girl&quot;. Her youth had been spent among a Scottish-Canadian family where Scottish tales, myths, and legends had often been recounted, and Montgomery used this background to create the character of 14-year-old Sara Stanley, a skilled storyteller who was an &quot;idealized&quot; version of her adolescent self. The character of Peter Craig in &quot;The Story Girl&quot; very much resembles Herman Leard, the great love of Montgomery&#x27;s life, the man she wished she had married, but did not, right down to having blond curly hair. As with her relationship with Leard, the other characters object to the lower-class Craig as not &quot;good enough&quot;, but Felicity King chooses him anyway.

===World War I===

During the First World War, Montgomery, horrified by reports of the &quot;Rape of Belgium&quot; in 1914, was an intense supporter of the war effort, seeing the war as a crusade to save civilization, regularly writing articles urging men to volunteer for the Canadian Expeditionary Force and for people on the home front to buy victory bonds. Montgomery wrote in her diary on September 12, 1914, about the reports of the &quot;Rape of Belgium&quot;:But oh, there have been such hideous stories in the papers lately of their cutting off the hands of little children in Belgium. Can they be true? They have committed terrible outrages and crimes, that is too surely true, but I hope desperately that these stories of the mutilation of children are false. They harrow my soul. I walk the floor in my agony over them. I cry myself to sleep about them and wake again in the darkness to cringe with the horror of it. If it were Chester! In Leaskdale, like everywhere else in Canada, recruiting meetings were held where ministers, such as the Reverend Macdonald, would speak of Kaiser Wilhelm II as the personification of evil, described the &quot;Rape of Belgium&quot; in graphic detail, and asked for young men to step up to volunteer to fight for Canada, the British Empire, and for justice, in what was described at the time as a crusade against evil. In a 1915 essay appealing for volunteers, Montgomery wrote: &quot;I am not one of those who believe that this war will put an end to war. War is horrible, but there are things that are more horrible still, just as there are fates worse than death.&quot; Montgomery argued prior to the war that Canada had been slipping into atheism, materialism and &quot;moral decay&quot;, and the war had brought about a welcome revival of Christianity, patriotism and moral strength as the Canadian people faced the challenge of the greatest war yet fought in history. Montgomery ended her essay by stating that women on the home front were playing a crucial role in the war effort, which led her to ask for women&#x27;s suffrage. On October 7, 1915, Montgomery gave birth to her third child and was thrown into depression when she discovered she could not produce breast milk to feed her son, who was given cow&#x27;s milk instead, which was a health risk in the days before pasteurization.

Montgomery identified very strongly with the Allied cause, leading her on March 10, 1916, to write in her diary: &quot;All my misery seemed to centre around Verdun where the snow was no longer white. I seemed in my own soul to embrace all the anguish and strain of France.&quot; In the same diary entry, Montgomery wrote of a strange experience, &quot;a great calm seemed to descend upon me and envelop me. I was at peace. The conviction seized upon me that Verdun was safe-that the Germans would not pass the grim barrier of desperate France. I was as a woman from whom some evil spirit had been driven-or can it be as a priestess of old, who out of depths of agony wins some strange foresight of the future?&quot; Montgomery celebrated every Allied victory at her house, for instance running up the Russian flag when she heard that the Russians had captured the supposedly impregnable Ottoman city-fortress of Trebizond in April 1916. Every Allied defeat depressed her. When she heard of the fall of Kut-al-Amara, she wrote in her diary on May 1, 1916: &quot;Kut-el-Amara has been compelled to surrender at last. We have expected it for some time, but that did not prevent us from feeling very blue over it all. It is an encouragement to the Germans and a blow to Britain&#x27;s prestige. I feel too depressed tonight to do anything.&quot; Much to Montgomery&#x27;s disgust, Ewen refused to preach about the war. As it went on, Maud wrote in her diary &quot;it unsettles him and he cannot do his work properly.&quot; The Reverend Macdonald had developed doubts about the justice of the war as it went along, and had come to believe that by encouraging young men to enlist, he had sinned grievously.

Montgomery, a deeply religious woman, wrote in her diary: &quot;I believe in a God who is good, but not omnipotent. I also believe in a principle of Evil, equal to God in power ... darkness to His light. I believe an infinite ceaseless struggle goes on between them.&quot; In a letter, Montgomery dismissed Kaiser Wilhelm II&#x27;s claim that God was on the side of Germany, stating that the power responsible for the death of &quot;little Hugh&quot; (her stillborn son) was the same power responsible for the &quot;Rape of Belgium&quot;, and for this reason she believed the Allies were destined to win the war. Montgomery had worked as a Sunday School teacher at her husband&#x27;s church, and many of the men from Uxbridge county who were killed or wounded in the war had once been her students, causing her much emotional distress. Uxbridge county lost 21 men in the Great War from 1915, when Canadian troops first saw action at the Second Battle of Ypres, until the war&#x27;s end in 1918. Montgomery&#x27;s biographer Mary Henley Rubio observed: &quot;Increasingly, the war was all that she thought of and wanted to talk about. Her journals show she was absolutely consumed by it, wracked by it, tortured by it, obsessed by it -- even addicted to it.&quot; Montgomery was sometimes annoyed if her husband did not buy a daily newspaper from the corner store because she always wanted to read the latest war news.

===Battles with depression and the Spanish flu===

Montgomery underwent several periods of depression while trying to cope with the duties of motherhood and church life and with her husband&#x27;s attacks of religious melancholia (endogenous major depressive disorder) and deteriorating health: &quot;For a woman who had given the world so much joy, life was mostly an unhappy one.&quot; In 1918, Montgomery was stricken with and was almost killed by the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic that killed between 50 and 100 million people all over the world in 1918–1919, spending ten days bed-ridden with the Spanish flu. In her diary on December 1, 1918, Montgomery wrote after a visit to Toronto in November: &quot;Toronto was then beginning to be panic stricken over the outbreak of the terrible &#x27;Spanish flu&#x27;. The drug counters were besieged with frantic people seeking remedies and safeguards&quot;. Montgomery wrote in her diary about being infected with Spanish flu: &quot;I was in bed for ten days. I never felt so sick or weak in my life&quot;, going on to express thanks to God and her friends for helping her survive the ordeal. Montgomery&#x27;s best friend Frederica Campbell MacFarlane was not so lucky and died after contracting the Spanish flu on January 20, 1919.

After the First World War, a recurring character in Montgomery&#x27;s journal that was to obsess her for the rest of her life was &quot;the Piper&quot;, who at first appeared as a heroic Highlander piper from Scotland, leading men into battle while playing traditional Highland tunes, but who turned out to be the Pied Piper of Hamelin, a trickster taking children away from their parents forever. The figure of &quot;the Piper&quot; reflected Montgomery&#x27;s own disillusionment with World War I and her guilt at her ardent support for the war. To inspire men to volunteer for the war, a piper had marched through the centre of Leaskdale daily for all four years of World War I, playing Highland war tunes, which had given Montgomery the inspiration of the figure of &quot;the Piper&quot;, &quot;The Piper&quot; first appears in the Anne books in &quot;Rainbow Valley&quot; (1919), inspiring the future grown children of Glen St. Mary with his courage. In &quot;Rilla of Ingleside&quot; (1921), &quot;the Piper&quot; returns as a more sinister figure, inspiring Anne&#x27;s son Walter to enlist in the Canadian expeditionary force, while taking on the appearance and personality of the Pied Piper of Hamelin.

After the end of the Great War and the death of their mutual close friend, Frederica, Ewen Macdonald suffered a nervous breakdown and was never the same person he had been before 1919. The Reverend Ewen Macdonald, a good Calvinist who believed in predestination, had become convinced that he was not one of &quot;the Elect&quot; chosen by God to go to Heaven, leading him to spend hours depressed and staring into space. The Reverend Macdonald told his wife, during his episodes of depression, that he wished she and their children had never been born as they were also not of &quot;the Elect&quot;, and all of them were going to Hell when they died as he believed that they were all predestined to be among the &quot;damned.&quot; Macdonald refused to assist with raising the children or the housework, and was given over to erratic, reckless driving as if he was deliberately trying to get himself killed in a car crash, as perhaps he was. Montgomery herself was driven to depression by her husband&#x27;s conduct, often writing that she wished she had married somebody else. Montgomery wrote in her diary that she could not stand looking at her husband&#x27;s face, when he had that &quot;horrible imbecile expression on his face&quot; as he stared blankly into space for hours.

In February 1920, Montgomery wrote in her diary about having to deal with:A letter from some pathetic ten-year old in New York who implores me to send her my photo because she lies awake in her bed wondering what I look like. Well, if she had a picture of me in my old dress, wresting with the furniture this morning, &quot;cussing&quot; the ashes and clinkers, she would die of disillusionment. However, I shall send her a reprint of my last photo in which I sat in rapt inspiration—apparently—at my desk, with pen in my hand, in gown of lace and silk with hair so—Amen. A quite passable woman, of no kin whatever to the dusty, ash-covered Cinderella of the furnace-cellar. For much of her life, writing was her one great solace. In 1920, Montgomery wrote in her diary a quotation from the South African writer Olive Schreiner&#x27;s book &quot;The Story of an African Farm,&quot; which defined different types of love, including a &quot;love without wisdom, sweet as life, bitter as death, lasting only a hour&quot;, leading her to write: &quot;But it is worth having lived a whole life for that hour.&quot; (emphasis in the original). Montgomery concluded:My love for Hermann Leard, though so incomplete, is ... a memory which I would not barter for anything save the lives of my children and the return of Frede [Frederica Campbell MacFarlane, her best friend]. Montgomery believed her spells of depression and the migraine headaches she suffered from were both expressions of her suppressed romantic passions and Leard&#x27;s ghost haunting her.

===Publishing disputes and films===

Starting in 1917, Montgomery was engaged in five bitter, costly, and burdensome lawsuits with Louis Coues Page, owner of the publishing house L.C. Page &amp; Company, that continued until she finally won in 1928. Page had a well-deserved reputation as one of the most tyrannical figures in American publishing, a bully with a ferocious temper who signed his authors to exploitative contracts and liked to humiliate his subordinates, including his mild-mannered younger brother George, in public. Montgomery received 7 cents on the dollar on the sale of every one of the &quot;Anne&quot; books, instead of the 19 cents on the dollar that she was entitled to, which led her to switch publishers in 1917 when she finally discovered that Page was cheating her. When Montgomery left the firm of L.C. Page &amp; Company, Page demanded she sign over the American rights to &quot;Anne&#x27;s House of Dreams&quot;, and when she refused he cut off the royalties from the earlier &quot;Anne&quot; books. Even though he did not own the U.S. rights to &quot;Anne&#x27;s House of Dreams&quot;, Page sold those rights to the disreputable publishing house of Grosset &amp; Dunlap, as a way of creating more pressure on Montgomery to capitulate. Instead, Montgomery sued Grosset &amp; Dunlap. Page was counting on the fact that he was a millionaire and Montgomery was not, and that the prospect of having to spend thousands in legal fees would force her to give in. Much to his surprise, she did not. Montgomery hired a lawyer in Boston and sued Page in the Massachusetts Court of Equity for illegally withholding royalties due her and for selling the U.S. rights to &quot;Anne&#x27;s House of Dreams&quot;, which he did not possess.

In 1920, the house where Montgomery grew up in Cavendish was torn down by her uncle, who complained that too many tourists were coming on to the property to see the house that inspired the house in which Anne was depicted as growing up. Montgomery was very sentimental about that house, and the news of its destruction caused her great pain. Between May and July 1920, Montgomery was in Boston to attend court sessions with Page, who taunted her by telling her the &quot;Anne&quot; books were still selling well, making him millions.

In 1920, Montgomery was infuriated with the 1919 film version of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; for changing Anne from a Canadian to an American, writing in her diary: It was a pretty little play well photographed, but I think if I hadn&#x27;t already known it was from my book, that I would never have recognized it. The landscape and folks were &#x27;New England&#x27;, never P.E. Island ... A skunk and an American flag were introduced—both equally unknown in PE Island. I could have shrieked with rage over the latter. Such crass, blatant Yankeeism! Reporting on the film&#x27;s premiere in Los Angeles, one American journalist described &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; as written by a &quot;Mr. Montgomery&quot;, who is only mentioned in passing two-thirds into the article with the major focus being on the film&#x27;s star Mary Miles Minter, who was presented as the true embodiment of Anne. Montgomery disapproved of Minter&#x27;s performance, writing she portrayed &quot;a sweet, sugary heroine utterly unlike my gingerly Anne&quot; and complained about a scene in the film where Anne used a shotgun to threaten people with, writing that her Anne would never do such a thing. Montgomery had no say in either the 1919 or 1934 versions of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; as the publisher, L.C. Page had acquired the film rights to the story in 1908, and as such, all of the royalties paid by Hollywood for both versions of &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; went to him, not Montgomery. Montgomery stopped writing about Anne in about 1920, writing in her journal that she had tired of the character. By February 1921, Montgomery estimated that she had made about $100,000 from the sales of the Anne books while declaring in her diary: &quot;It&#x27;s a pity it doesn&#x27;t buy happiness.&quot; She preferred instead to create books about other young, female characters, feeling that her strength was writing about characters who were either very young or very old. Other series written by Montgomery include the &quot;Emily&quot; and &quot;Pat&quot; books, which, while successful, did not reach the same level of public acceptance as the &quot;Anne&quot; volumes. She also wrote a number of stand-alone novels, which were also generally successful, if not as successful as her Anne books.

On August 20, 1921, Montgomery started writing what became the novel &quot;Emily of New Moon&quot;, as she planned to replace Anne with Emily as the star of a new series of novels. The character Emily was partly autobiographical, as Emily&#x27;s dream was to be a writer when she grew up. Unlike Anne, who does not have clear goals about what she wants to be when she grows up, Emily Starr knows she wants to be a writer, a characteristic she shared with Montgomery. One aspect that Emily, Anne and Montgomery all shared was &quot;the flash&quot;—the mystical power that Montgomery called in &quot;Emily of New Moon&quot; &quot;the wonderful moment when the soul seemed to cast aside the bonds of the flesh and spring upward towards the stars,&quot; allowing the soul to see &quot;behind the veil&quot; to a transcendent beauty.

In 1925, a Massachusetts court ruled in favour of Montgomery against her publisher, Louis Coues Page, as the judge found that he had systemically cheated her out of the profits from the &quot;Anne&quot; books since 1908. Page used every conceivable excuse to avoid paying Montgomery what he owed her and, after his brother George died of a heart attack in 1927, accused Montgomery of causing his brother&#x27;s death by suing him for shares of the royalties. In fact, Louis Page was not close to George, who had just left the firm of L.C. Page &amp; Company to get away from his abrasive and arrogant brother before he died of a heart attack, at age 52. In October 1928, Montgomery finally won while Page, continued to insist in public that she had caused the death of his brother, which he used as a reason why he should not have to pay Montgomery anything. Page waged a campaign of harassment against Montgomery, sending her telegrams accusing her of causing his brother&#x27;s death and the subsequent mental breakdown of his widow by defeating him in court, asking her if she was pleased with what she had allegedly done. Page&#x27;s behavior badly damaged his business, as no author chose to go with a publisher who had revealed himself to be both dishonest and vindictive, and after the 1920s Page&#x27;s publishing house largely depended upon reissuing older books rather than new ones as authors took their business elsewhere. On November 7, 1928, Montgomery received a cheque for the $15,000 US dollars, the amount that the auditors established Page had cheated her.

In terms of sales, both in her lifetime and since, Montgomery was the most successful Canadian author of all time, but because her books were seen as children&#x27;s books and as women&#x27;s books, she was often dismissed by the critics, who saw Montgomery as merely a writer for schoolgirls, and not as a serious writer. In 1924, the &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; magazine asked its readers to nominate the 14 greatest living Canadians, and all of the winners were men. Montgomery only made the runners-up, coming in at 16. However, Montgomery did make it onto another list of the 12 greatest living Canadian women. Hammill argued that Montgomery was successful at managing her fame, but the media&#x27;s fixation on presenting her as the idealised woman writer, together with her desire to hide her unhappy home life with her husband, meant that her creation Anne, whose &quot;life&quot; was more &quot;knowable&quot; and easier to relate to, overshadowed her both in her lifetime and after.

===Later life===

In 1925, Ewen Macdonald became estranged from his flock when he opposed his church&#x27;s joining the United Church of Canada, and was involved in an incident where he nearly ran over a Methodist minister who was promoting the union. Montgomery, as the minister&#x27;s wife, had been a prominent member of the Leaskdale community and had been a much-loved figure who organized community events. Rubio wrote the people of Leaskdale &quot;liked&quot; the Reverend Macdonald, but &quot;loved&quot; Montgomery. At the same time, she complained in her diary her husband had a &quot;medieval mind&quot; when it came to women; to him: &quot;A woman is a thing of no importance intellectually -- the plaything and servant of man -- and couldn&#x27;t possibly do anything that would be worthy of a real tribute.&quot;

In 1926, the family moved into the Norval Presbyterian Charge, in present-day Halton Hills, Ontario, where today the Lucy Maud Montgomery Memorial Garden can be seen from Highway 7. In 1934, Montgomery&#x27;s extremely depressed husband signed himself into a sanatorium in Guelph. After his release, the drug store gave Montgomery a &quot;blue pill&quot; intended to treat her husband&#x27;s depression that was accidentally laced with insecticide (a mistake on the part of the drug store clerk) that almost killed him. The Reverend Macdonald became notably paranoid after this incident, as his mental health continued to deteriorate.

In 1933, Montgomery published &quot;Pat of Silver Bush&quot;, which reflected a move towards more &quot;adult&quot; stories for young people. Unlike Anne with her sense of optimism and vibrancy, Pat is a &quot;queer&quot; moody girl who is noted for being a &quot;loner&quot;. Pat&#x27;s best friend, Elizabeth &quot;Bets&quot; Wilcox, dies of the Spanish flu, giving the book a darker tone than Montgomery&#x27;s previous books. In a letter to a fan in 1934 who complained about the dark mood of &quot;Pat of Silver Bush&quot;, Montgomery replied: &quot;I gave Anne my imagination and Emily Starr my knack for scribbling; but the girl who is more myself than any other is &#x27;Pat of Silver Bush&#x27; ... Not &quot;externally&quot;, but spiritually she is I&quot;. Pat&#x27;s deep attachment to the countryside of Prince Edward Island, especially her family farm, Silver Bush, mirrored Montgomery&#x27;s own attachment to the countryside of her home province, and the farm that she grew up on.

In 1935, upon her husband&#x27;s retirement, Montgomery moved to Swansea, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto, buying a house that she named Journey&#x27;s End, situated on Riverside Drive along the east bank of the Humber River. Montgomery continued to write and in addition to writing other material, returned to writing about Anne after a 15-year hiatus, filling in previously unexplored gaps in the chronology she had developed for the character. She published &quot;Anne of Windy Poplars&quot; in 1936 and &quot;Anne of Ingleside&quot; in 1939. &quot;Jane of Lantern Hill&quot;, a non-Anne novel, was also composed around this time and published in 1937. On June 3, 1935 (1935 Birthday Honours), King George V named Montgomery an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE), and on September 8, 1935, at Rideau Hall in Ottawa, the ceremony of investiture into the Order was held with the Governor-General, Lord Bessborough, conducting the ceremony. As an Officer of the Order of the British Empire, Montgomery was given a special badge and ribbon, which could only be worn in public in the presence of the King or one of his representatives, such as the Governor-General of Canada. Her husband did not attend the ceremony, but Montgomery was by all accounts greatly honoured to be appointed an OBE.

Writing kept up Montgomery&#x27;s spirits as she battled depression while taking various pills to improve her mood, but in public she presented a happy, smiling face, giving speeches to various professional groups all over Canada. At the Toronto Book Fair, held on November 9, 1936, to promote Canadian literature, Montgomery met the pseudo-Ojibwe author and environmentalist Grey Owl. During her speech to the assembled authors, Montgomery spoke of hearing an &quot;owl&#x27;s laughter&quot; in Leaskdale, causing Grey Owl to jump up and interrupt her, saying: &quot;You are the first white person I have ever met who has heard an owl&#x27;s laughter. I thought nobody but Indians ever heard it. We hear it often because we are a silent race. My full name is Laughing Grey Owl.&quot; Grey Owl&#x27;s remark made the front page of &quot;The Toronto Mail and Empire&quot; newspaper the next day. Montgomery described Grey Owl in her diary: &quot;Grey Owl was looking quite the Indian of romance, with his long black braids of hair, his feather headdress and a genuine scalping knife -- at least he told us it was genuine.&quot; Montgomery liked Grey Owl&#x27;s speech the same evening stating that Canada&#x27;s &quot;greatest asset is her forest lands&quot; and that most Canadians were too proud of &quot;skyscrapers on Yonge Street&quot; rather than the &quot;natural resources we are destroying as fast as we can&quot;. After Grey Owl&#x27;s death in 1938, and the revelation that the supposed Ojibwe was actually the Englishman Archie Belaney, Montgomery stated that though Belaney lied about being an Ojibwe his concerns for the environment, nature, and animals were real; and for this reason Grey Owl&#x27;s message was worth cherishing.

On November 10, 1937, Montgomery gave a speech in Toronto at another annual gathering of the Toronto Book Fair calling for Canadian writers to write more stories about Canada, arguing that Canadians had great stories worth writing. Despite her efforts to raise the profile of Canadian literature through the Canadian Authors Association, the male &quot;avant garde&quot; of Canadian literature led by Frederick Philip Grove, F. R. Scott, Morley Callaghan and Raymond Knister complained about the mostly female membership of the CAA, whom they felt had overly glorified someone like Montgomery who was not a &quot;serious&quot; writer. Over time, Montgomery became addicted to bromides and barbiturates that the doctors had given her to help treat her depression.

Montgomery was greatly upset by World War II, calling the war in a 1940 letter &quot;this nightmare that has been loosed on the world... unfair that we should have to go through it again.&quot; In her only diary entry for 1941, Montgomery wrote on July 8, 1941: &quot;Oh God, such an end to life. Such suffering and wretchedness.&quot; On December 28, 1941, Montgomery wrote to a friend: &quot;This past year has been one of constant blows to me. My oldest son has made a mess of his life and his wife has left him. My husband&#x27;s nerves are even worse than mine. I have kept the nature of his attacks from you for over 20 years but they have broken me at last ... I could not go out to select a book for you this year. Pardon me. I could not even write this if I had not been a hypodermic. The war situation kills me along with many other things. I expect conscription will come in and they will take my second son and then I will give up all effort to recover because I shall have nothing to live for.&quot; In 1940, the Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King introduced conscription under the National Resources Mobilization Act, but with the caveat that conscripts could only be used in the defence of North America, and only volunteers would be sent overseas. Mackenzie King scheduled a referendum for April 27, 1942, to ask the voters to release him from his promise to only send volunteers overseas, which Montgomery alluded to in her letter mentioning &quot;conscription will come in.&quot; In her last entry in her diary on March 23, 1942, Montgomery wrote: &quot;Since then my life has been hell, hell, hell. My mind is gone—everything in the world I lived for has gone–the world has gone mad. I shall be driven to end my life. Oh God, forgive me. Nobody dreams of what my awful position is.&quot;

In the last year of her life, Montgomery completed what she intended to be a ninth book featuring Anne, titled &quot;The Blythes Are Quoted&quot;. It included fifteen short stories (many of which were previously published) that she revised to include Anne and her family as mainly peripheral characters; forty-one poems (most of which were previously published) that she attributed to Anne and to her son Walter, who died as a soldier in the Great War; and vignettes featuring the Blythe family members discussing the poems. The book was delivered to Montgomery&#x27;s publisher on the day of her death, but for reasons unexplained, the publisher declined to issue the book at the time. Montgomery scholar Benjamin Lefebvre speculates that the book&#x27;s dark tone and anti-war message (Anne speaks very bitterly of WWI in one passage) may have made the volume unsuitable to publish in the midst of the Second World War.

An abridged version of this book, which shortened and reorganized the stories and omitted all the vignettes and all but one of the poems, was published as a collection of short stories called &quot;The Road to Yesterday&quot; in 1974, more than 30 years after the original work had been submitted. A complete edition of &quot;The Blythes Are Quoted&quot;, edited by Benjamin Lefebvre, was finally published in its entirety by Viking Canada in October 2009, more than 67 years after it was composed.

==Death==

On April 24, 1942, Montgomery was found dead in her bed in her Toronto home. The primary cause of death recorded on her death certificate was coronary thrombosis. However, in September 2008, her granddaughter, Kate Macdonald Butler, revealed that Montgomery suffered from depression—possibly as a result of caring for her mentally ill husband for decades—and may have ended her life through a drug overdose.

A note was found on Montgomery&#x27;s bedside table, which read, in part:

... I have lost my mind by spells and I do not dare think what I may do in those spells. May God forgive me and I hope everyone else will forgive me even if they cannot understand. My position is too awful to endure and nobody realizes it. What an end to a life in which I tried always to do my best.

An alternative explanation of this document is provided in Mary Henley Rubio&#x27;s 2008 biography &quot;Lucy Maud Montgomery: The Gift of Wings&quot;, which suggests that Montgomery may have intended it as an entry in part of a journal now lost, rather than a suicide note.

Montgomery was buried at the Cavendish Community Cemetery in Cavendish following her wake in the Green Gables farmhouse and funeral in the Cavendish United Church (formerly Cavendish Presbyterian Church).

During her lifetime, Montgomery had published twenty novels, over 500 short stories, an autobiography, and a book of poetry. Aware of her fame, by 1920 Montgomery began editing and recopying her journals, presenting her life as she wanted it remembered. In doing so, certain episodes were changed or omitted.

==Legacy==
===Posthumous short story compilations===
Since the late 1970s - and in earnest since the publication of &quot;Akin to Anne&quot; in 1988 - dozens of Montgomery&#x27;s short stories, many of which were only published once in magazine format in the early 20th century and unavailable in the decades that followed, have been compiled into a variety of themed omnibuses. Examples include &quot;Akin to Anne&quot; (stories about other orphans separate from Anne Shirley), &quot;Among the Shadows&quot; (dark tales), &quot;At the Altar&quot; (marriage-themed stories), &quot;Along the Sea&quot; (stories with a maritime theme) and a collection of Christmas-related pieces.

===Collections===

The L. M. Montgomery Institute, founded in 1993, at the University of Prince Edward Island, promotes scholarly inquiry into the life, works, culture, and influence of L. M. Montgomery and coordinates most of the research and conferences surrounding her work. The Montgomery Institute collection consists of novels, manuscripts, texts, letters, photographs, sound recordings and artifacts and other Montgomery ephemera.

Her major collections (including personal journals, photographs, needlework, two book manuscripts, and her personal library) are archived in the McLaughlin Library&#x27;s Archival and Special Collections at the University of Guelph.

The first biography of Montgomery was &quot;The Wheel of Things: A Biography of L. M. Montgomery&quot; (1975), written by Mollie Gillen. Dr. Gillen also discovered over 40 of Montgomery&#x27;s letters to her pen-friend George Boyd MacMillan in Scotland and used them as the basis for her work. Beginning in the 1980s, her complete journals, edited by Mary Rubio and Elizabeth Waterston, were published by the Oxford University Press. From 1988 to 1995, editor Rea Wilmshurst collected and published numerous short stories by Montgomery. Most of her essays, along with interviews with Montgomery, commentary on her work, and coverage of her death and funeral, appear in Benjamin Lefebvre&#x27;s &quot;The L. M. Montgomery Reader&quot;, Volume 1: &quot;A Life in Print&quot; (2013).

Despite the fact that Montgomery published over twenty books, &quot;she never felt she achieved her one &#x27;great&#x27; book.&quot; Her readership, however, has always found her characters and stories to be among the best in fiction. Mark Twain said Montgomery&#x27;s Anne was &quot;the dearest and most moving and delightful child since the immortal Alice.&quot; Montgomery was honoured by being the first female in Canada to be named a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and was invested Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1935.

However, her fame was not limited to Canadian audiences. &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; became a success worldwide. For example, every year, thousands of Japanese tourists &quot;make a pilgrimage to a green-gabled Victorian farmhouse in the town of Cavendish on Prince Edward Island.&quot; In 2012, the original novel &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; was ranked number nine among all-time best children&#x27;s novels in a survey published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;, a monthly with primarily U.S. audience. The British public ranked it number 41 among all novels in The Big Read, a 2003 BBC survey to determine the &quot;nation&#x27;s best-loved novel.&quot; The British scholar Faye Hammill observed that Montgomery is an author overshadowed by her creation as licence plates on Prince Edward Island bear the slogan &quot;P.E.I. Home of Anne of Green Gables&quot; rather than &quot;P.E.I. Birthplace of L.M Montgomery. Much to Montgomery&#x27;s own annoyance, the media in both the United States and Canada tried to project the personality of Anne Shirley onto her.

===Landmarked places===

Montgomery&#x27;s home, the Leaskdale Manse in Ontario, and the area surrounding Green Gables and her Cavendish home on Prince Edward Island, have both been designated National Historic Sites. Montgomery herself was designated a Person of National Historic Significance by the Government of Canada in 1943.

Bala&#x27;s Museum in Bala, Ontario, is a house museum established in 1992. Officially it is &quot;Bala&#x27;s Museum with Memories of Lucy Maud Montgomery&quot;, for Montgomery and her family ate their meals in the boarding house while staying at another nearby boarding house during a July 1922 holiday that inspired her novel &quot;The Blue Castle&quot; (1926). The museum hosts some events pertaining to Montgomery or her fiction, including a re-enactment of the holiday visit.

===Honours and awards===

Montgomery was honoured by King George V as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 1935 Birthday Honours; there were no Canadian orders, decorations or medals for civilians until the 1970s.

Montgomery was named a National Historic Person in 1943 by the Canadian federal government. Her Ontario residence was designated a National Historic Site in 1997 (Leaskdale Manse), while the place that inspired her famous novels, Green Gables, was formally recognized as &quot;L. M. Montgomery&#x27;s Cavendish National Historic Site&quot; in 2004.

On May 15, 1975, the Post Office Department issued a stamp to &quot;Lucy Maud Montgomery, Anne of Green Gables&quot; designed by Peter Swan and typographed by Bernard N. J. Reilander. The 8¢ stamps are perforated 13 and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited.

A pair of stamps was issued in 2008 by Canada Post, marking the centennial of the publication of Montgomery&#x27;s classic first novel.

The City of Toronto named a park for her (Lucy Maud Montgomery Park) and in 1983 placed a historical marker there near the house where she lived from 1935 until her death in 1942.

On November 30, 2015 (her 141st birthday), Google honoured Montgomery with a Google Doodle published in twelve countries.

The Royal Canadian Mint issued a commemorative loonie to celebrate Montgomery&#x27;s 150th birthday. The coin features artwork by Brenda Jones of Montgomery and Anne Shirley, Montgomery&#x27;s most famous character. The coin was unveiled June 26, 2024 and began circulation on June 27, 2024.

===Disputes over royalties intellectual property rights===

There have been multiple adaptations of Montgomery&#x27;s work. Television producer Kevin Sullivan negotiated permission with Montgomery&#x27;s heirs prior to producing the popular 1985 miniseries &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;, and several sequels, only to have multiple legal disputes with them. In 1999 Sullivan and his partners announced plans to make Sullivan Entertainment a publicly traded company. In their prospectus they described the works based on Montgomery&#x27;s novels as profitable. Montgomery&#x27;s heirs sued him, claiming he had not paid them their contracted share of royalties, claiming the films had failed to turn a profit. However, a settlement for the outstanding Anne of Green Gables lawsuit between Sullivan, the Montgomery heirs and the Anne of Green Gables Licensing Authority (AGGLA) was reached in 2006 to deal with the outstanding disagreements.

<text>An anachronism (from the Greek , &#x27;against&#x27; and , &#x27;time&#x27;) is a chronological inconsistency in some arrangement, especially a juxtaposition of people, events, objects, language terms and customs from different time periods. The most common type of anachronism is an object misplaced in time, but it may be a verbal expression, a technology, a philosophical idea, a musical style, a material, a plant or animal, a custom, or anything else associated with a particular period that is placed outside its proper temporal domain.

An anachronism may be either intentional or unintentional. Intentional anachronisms may be introduced into a literary or artistic work to help a contemporary audience engage more readily with a historical period. Anachronism can also be used intentionally for purposes of rhetoric, propaganda, comedy, or shock. Unintentional anachronisms may occur when a writer, artist, or performer is unaware of differences in technology, terminology and language, customs and attitudes, or even fashions between different historical periods and eras.

==Types==
The metachronism-prochronism contrast is nearly synonymous with parachronism-anachronism, and involves postdating-predating respectively.

===Parachronism ===
A parachronism (from the Greek , &quot;on the side&quot;, and , &quot;time&quot;) postdates. It is anything that appears in a time period in which it is not normally found (though not sufficiently out of place as to be impossible).

This may be an object, idiomatic expression, technology, philosophical idea, musical style, material, custom, or anything else so closely bound to a particular time period as to seem strange when encountered in a later era. They may be objects or ideas that were once common but are now considered rare or inappropriate. They can take the form of obsolete technology or outdated fashion or idioms. 

===Prochronism ===
A prochronism (from the Greek , &quot;before&quot;, and , &quot;time&quot;) predates. It is an impossible anachronism which occurs when an object or idea has not yet been invented when the situation takes place, and therefore could not have possibly existed at the time. A prochronism may be an object not yet developed, a verbal expression that had not yet been coined, a philosophy not yet formulated, a breed of animal not yet evolved or bred, or use of a technology that had not yet been created. 
===Metachronism===
A metachronism (from the Greek , &quot;after&quot;, and , &quot;time&quot;) postdates. It is the use of older cultural artifacts in modern settings which may seem inappropriate. For example, it could be considered metachronistic for a modern-day person to be depicted wearing a top hat or writing with a quill. 

==Politically motivated anachronism==
Works of art and literature promoting a political, nationalist or revolutionary cause may use anachronism to depict an institution or custom as being more ancient than it actually is, or otherwise intentionally blur the distinctions between past and present. For example, the 19th-century Romanian painter Constantin Lecca depicts the peace agreement between Ioan Bogdan Voievod and Radu Voievod—two leaders in Romania&#x27;s 16th-century history—with the flags of Moldavia (blue-red) and of Wallachia (yellow-blue) seen in the background. These flags date only from the 1830s: anachronism promotes legitimacy for the unification of Moldavia and Wallachia into the Kingdom of Romania at the time the painting was made. The Russian artist Vasily Vereshchagin, in his painting &quot;Suppression of the Indian Revolt by the English&quot; (), depicts the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, when mutineers were executed by being blown from guns. In order to make the argument that the method of execution would again be utilized by the British if another rebellion broke out in India, Vereshchagin depicted the British soldiers conducting the executions in late 19th-century uniforms.

==Art and literature==
Anachronism is used especially in works of imagination that rest on a historical basis. Anachronisms may be introduced in many ways: for example, in the disregard of the different modes of life and thought that characterize different periods, or in ignorance of the progress of the arts and sciences and other facts of history. They vary from glaring inconsistencies to scarcely perceptible misrepresentation. Anachronisms may be the unintentional result of ignorance, or may be a deliberate aesthetic choice.

Sir Walter Scott justified the use of anachronism in historical literature: &quot;It is necessary, for exciting interest of any kind, that the subject assumed should be, as it were, translated into the manners as well as the language of the age we live in.&quot; However, as fashions, conventions and technologies move on, such attempts to use anachronisms to engage an audience may have quite the reverse effect, as the details in question are increasingly recognized as belonging neither to the historical era being represented, nor to the present, but to the intervening period in which the artwork was created. &quot;Nothing becomes obsolete like a period vision of an older period&quot;, writes Anthony Grafton; &quot;Hearing a mother in a historical movie of the 1940s call out &#x27;Ludwig! Ludwig van Beethoven! Come in and practice your piano now!&#x27; we are jerked from our suspension of disbelief by what was intended as a means of reinforcing it, and plunged directly into the American bourgeois world of the filmmaker.&quot;

It is only since the beginning of the 19th century that anachronistic deviations from historical reality have jarred on a general audience. C. S. Lewis wrote:
Anachronisms abound in the works of Raphael and Shakespeare, as well as in those of less celebrated painters and playwrights of earlier times. Carol Meyers says that anachronisms in ancient texts can be used to better understand the stories by asking what the anachronism represents. Repeated anachronisms and historical errors can become an accepted part of popular culture, such as the belief that Roman legionaries wore leather armor.

===Comical anachronism===
Comedy fiction set in the past may use anachronism for humorous effect. Comedic anachronism can be used to make serious points about both historical and modern society, such as drawing parallels to political or social conventions.

===Future anachronism===

Even with careful research, science fiction writers risk anachronism as their works age because they cannot predict all political, social, and technological change.

For example, many books, television shows, radio productions and films nominally set in the mid-21st century or later refer to the Soviet Union, to Saint Petersburg in Russia as Leningrad, to the continuing struggle between the Eastern and Western Blocs and to divided Germany and divided Berlin. &quot;Star Trek&quot; has suffered from future anachronisms; instead of &quot;retconning&quot; these errors, the 2009 film retained them for consistency with older franchises.

Buildings or natural features, such as the World Trade Center in New York City, can become out of place once they disappear, with some works having been edited to remove the World Trade Center to avoid this situation.

Futuristic technology may appear alongside technology which would be obsolete by the time in which the story is set. For example, in the stories of Robert A. Heinlein, interplanetary space travel coexists with calculation using slide rules.

===Language anachronism===
Language anachronisms in novels and films are quite common, both intentional and unintentional. Intentional anachronisms inform the audience more readily about a film set in the past. In this regard, language and pronunciation change so fast that most modern people (even many scholars) would find it difficult, or even impossible, to understand a film with dialogue in 15th-century English; thus, audiences willingly accept characters speaking an updated language, and modern slang and figures of speech are often used in these films.

==Unconscious anachronism==
Unintentional anachronisms may occur even in what are intended as wholly objective and accurate records or representations of historic artifacts and artworks, because the perspectives of historical recorders are conditioned by the assumptions and practices of their own times, in a form of cultural bias. One example is the attribution of historically inaccurate beards to various medieval tomb effigies and figures in stained glass in records made by English antiquaries of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. Working in an age in which beards were in fashion and widespread, the antiquaries seem to have unconsciously projected the fashion back into an era in which they were rare.

==In academia==

In historical writing, the most common type of anachronism is the adoption of the political, social or cultural concerns and assumptions of one era to interpret or evaluate the events and actions of another. The anachronistic application of present-day perspectives to comment on the historical past is sometimes described as presentism. Empiricist historians, working in the traditions established by Leopold von Ranke in the 19th century, regard this as a great error, and a trap to be avoided. Arthur Marwick has argued that &quot;a grasp of the fact that past societies are very different from our own, and ... very difficult to get to know&quot; is an essential and fundamental skill of the professional historian; and that &quot;anachronism is still one of the most obvious faults when the unqualified (those expert in other disciplines, perhaps) attempt to do history&quot;.

==Detection of forgery==
The ability to identify anachronisms may be employed as a critical and forensic tool to demonstrate the fraudulence of a document or artifact purporting to be from an earlier time. Anthony Grafton discusses, for example, the work of the 3rd-century philosopher Porphyry, of Isaac Casaubon (1559–1614), and of Richard Reitzenstein (1861–1931), all of whom succeeded in exposing literary forgeries and plagiarisms, such as those included in the &quot;Hermetic Corpus&quot;, through – among other techniques – the recognition of anachronisms. The detection of anachronisms is an important element within the scholarly discipline of diplomatics, the critical analysis of the forms and language of documents, developed by the Maurist scholar Jean Mabillon (1632–1707) and his successors René-Prosper Tassin (1697–1777) and Charles-François Toustain (1700–1754). The philosopher and reformer Jeremy Bentham wrote at the beginning of the 19th century:
Examples are:
* The exposure by Lorenzo Valla in 1440 of the so-called Donation of Constantine, a decree purportedly issued by the Emperor Constantine the Great in either 315 or 317 AD, as a later forgery, depended to a considerable degree on the identification of anachronisms, such as references to the city of Constantinople (a name not in fact bestowed until 330 AD).
* A large number of apparent anachronisms in the Book of Mormon have convinced critics that the book was written in the 19th century, and not, as its adherents claim, in pre-Columbian America.
* The use of 19th- and 20th-century anti-semitic terminology demonstrates that the purported &quot;Franklin Prophecy&quot; (attributed to Benjamin Franklin, who died in 1790) is a forgery.
* The &quot;William Lynch speech&quot;, an address, supposedly delivered in 1712, on the control of slaves in Virginia, is now considered to be a 20th-century forgery, partly on account of its use of anachronistic terms such as &quot;program&quot; and &quot;refueling&quot;.

<doc id="60733" wikidata="Q625652" url="?curid=60733" title="Hetman">
<text>Hetman is a political title from Central and Eastern Europe, historically assigned to military commanders (comparable to a field marshal or imperial marshal in the Holy Roman Empire). First used by the Czechs in Bohemia in the 15th century, it was the title of the second-highest military commander after the king in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania from the 16th to 18th centuries. Throughout much of the history of Romania and the Moldavia, hetmans were the second-highest army rank. In the modern Czech Republic, the title is used for regional governors.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;hetman&quot; was a Polish borrowing, most likely stemming via Czech from the Turkic title &quot;ataman&quot; (literally &#x27;father of horsemen&#x27;), however it could also come from the German – captain. Since hetman as a title first appeared in Czechia in the 15th century, assuming it stems from a Turkic language, it is possible it was introduced to Czechs by the Cumans.

==Hetmans of Poland and Lithuania==

The Polish title &quot;Grand Crown Hetman&quot; () dates from 1505. The title of &quot;Hetman&quot; was given to the leader of the Polish Army. Until 1581 the hetman position existed only during specific campaigns and wars. After that, it became a permanent title, as were all the titles in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. At any given time the Commonwealth had four hetmans – a &quot;Great Hetman&quot; and &quot;Field&quot; (deputy) &quot;Hetman&quot; each for both Poland and Lithuania.

From 1585, the title could not be taken away without a proven charge of treachery, so most hetmans served for life. Jan Karol Chodkiewicz literally commanded the army from his deathbed (1621). Hetmans were not paid by the royal treasury. Hetmans were the main commanders of the military forces, second only to the monarch in the army&#x27;s chain of command. The fact that they could not be removed by the monarch made them very independent, and thus often able to pursue independent policies.

This system worked well when a hetman had great ability and the monarch was weak, but sometimes produced disastrous results in the opposite case. The security of the position notably contrasted with that of military leaders in states bordering the commonwealth, where sovereigns could dismiss their army commanders at any time. In 1648 the Zaporizhian Host (a Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth subject) elected a hetman of its own, Bohdan Khmelnytsky, igniting the Ukrainian struggle for independence.

The military reform of 1776 curtailed the powers of the hetmans. The Hetman office was abolished after the Third Partition of Poland (1795).

==Hetmans of the Cossack Hetmanate and Ukraine==

At the end of the sixteenth century, the commanders of the Zaporizhian Cossacks were titled or &quot;Hetman&quot;; Christof Kosynsky was the first Zaporizhian hetman. In 1572, a hetman was a commander of the Registered Cossack Army () of the Commonwealth. From 1648, the start of Bohdan Khmelnytsky&#x27;s uprising, a hetman was the head of the whole Ukrainian State — and heads of the Cossack Hetmanate. As supreme military commanders and lawmakers (by administrative decree), they had very broad powers, although they were elected.

After the split of Ukraine along the Dnieper River by the 1667 Polish–Russian Treaty of Andrusovo, Ukrainian Cossacks (and Cossack hetmans) became known as Left-bank Cossacks (of the Cossack Hetmanate) and Right-bank Cossacks.

In the Russian Empire, the office of Cossack Hetman was abolished by Catherine II of Russia in 1764. The last Hetman of the Zaporozhian Army (the formal title of the hetman of Ukraine) was Kyrylo Rozumovsky, who reigned from 1751 until 1764.

The title was revived in Ukraine during the revolution of 1917 to 1921. In early 1918, a conservative German-supported coup overthrew the radical socialist Ukrainian Central Rada and its Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, establishing a hetmanate monarchy headed by Pavlo Skoropadskyi, who claimed the title &quot;Hetman of Ukraine&quot;. This regime lasted until late 1918, when it was overthrown by a new Directorate of Ukraine, of a re-established Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic.

==Hetmans of Bohemia, Romania, and Moldavia==
Used by the Czechs in Bohemia from the Hussite Wars (15th century) onward, is today the term for the elected governor of a Czech region ().

For much of the history of Romania and the Principality of Moldavia, hetmans were second in rank in the army, after the ruling prince, who held the position of voivode.

==Other uses==
&quot;Hetman&quot; has often been used figuratively to mean &#x27;commander&#x27; or simply &#x27;leader&#x27;. Examples:
* &quot;They say there was a whole band of them, and that this bearded man was their elder, the hetman.&quot; — Maxim Gorky, &quot;Mother&quot; (1906)
Queen (chess piece) is called &quot;hetman&quot; in Polish and coded as H in the algebraic notation.

<text>In finance, a bond is a type of security under which the issuer (debtor) owes the holder (creditor) a debt, and is obliged – depending on the terms – to provide cash flow to the creditor (e.g. repay the principal (i.e. amount borrowed) of the bond at the maturity date and interest (called the coupon) over a specified amount of time.) The timing and the amount of cash flow provided varies, depending on the economic value that is emphasized upon, thus giving rise to different types of bonds. The interest is usually payable at fixed intervals: semiannual, annual, and less often at other periods. Thus, a bond is a form of loan or IOU. Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term investments or, in the case of government bonds, to finance current expenditure.

Bonds and stocks are both securities, but the major difference between the two is that (capital) stockholders have an equity stake in a company (i.e. they are owners), whereas bondholders have a creditor stake in a company (i.e. they are lenders). As creditors, bondholders have priority over stockholders. This means they will be repaid in advance of stockholders, but will rank behind secured creditors, in the event of bankruptcy. Another difference is that bonds usually have a defined term, or maturity, after which the bond is redeemed, whereas stocks typically remain outstanding indefinitely. An exception is an irredeemable bond, which is a perpetuity, that is, a bond with no maturity. Certificates of deposit (CDs) or short-term commercial paper are classified as money market instruments and not bonds: the main difference is the length of the term of the instrument.

The most common forms include municipal, corporate, and government bonds. Very often the bond is negotiable, that is, the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market. This means that once the transfer agents at the bank medallion-stamp the bond, it is highly liquid on the secondary market. The price of a bond in the secondary market may differ substantially from the principal due to various factors in bond valuation.

Bonds are often identified by their international securities identification number, or ISIN, which is a 12-digit alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies debt securities.

==Etymology==
In English, the word &quot;&quot; relates to the etymology of &quot;bind&quot;. The use of the word &quot;bond&quot; in this sense of an &quot;instrument binding one to pay a sum to another&quot; dates from at least the 1590s.

==Issuance==
Bonds are issued by public authorities, credit institutions, companies and supranational institutions in the primary markets. The most common process for issuing bonds is through underwriting. When a bond issue is underwritten, one or more securities firms or banks, forming a syndicate, buy the entire issue of bonds from the issuer and resell them to investors. The security firm takes the risk of being unable to sell on the issue to end investors. Primary issuance is arranged by &quot;bookrunners&quot; who arrange the bond issue, have direct contact with investors and act as advisers to the bond issuer in terms of timing and price of the bond issue. The bookrunner is listed first among all underwriters participating in the issuance in the tombstone ads commonly used to announce bonds to the public. The bookrunners&#x27; willingness to underwrite must be discussed prior to any decision on the terms of the bond issue as there may be limited demand for the bonds.

In contrast, government bonds are usually issued in an auction. In some cases, both members of the public and banks may bid for bonds. In other cases, only market makers may bid for bonds. The overall rate of return on the bond depends on both the terms of the bond and the price paid. The terms of the bond, such as the coupon, are fixed in advance and the price is determined by the market.

In the case of an underwritten bond, the underwriters will charge a fee for underwriting. An alternative process for bond issuance, which is commonly used for smaller issues and avoids this cost, is the private placement bond. Bonds sold directly to buyers may not be tradeable in the bond market.

Historically, an alternative practice of issuance was for the borrowing government authority to issue bonds over a period of time, usually at a fixed price, with volumes sold on a particular day dependent on market conditions. This was called a &quot;tap issue&quot; or &quot;bond tap&quot;.

==Features==
===Principal===

Nominal, principal, par, or face amount is the amount on which the issuer pays interest, and which, most commonly, has to be repaid at the end of the term. Some structured bonds can have a redemption amount which is different from the face amount and can be linked to the performance of particular assets.

===Maturity===
The issuer is obligated to repay the nominal amount on the maturity date. As long as all due payments have been made, the issuer has no further obligations to the bond holders after the maturity date. The length of time until the maturity date is often referred to as the term or tenor or maturity of a bond. The maturity can be any length of time, although debt securities with a term of less than one year are generally designated money market instruments rather than bonds. Most bonds have a term shorter than 30 years. Some bonds have been issued with terms of 50 years or more, and historically there have been some issues with no maturity date (irredeemable). In the market for United States Treasury securities, there are four categories of bond maturities:

* short term (bills): maturities under one year;
* medium term (notes): maturities between one and ten years;
* long term (bonds): maturities between ten and thirty years;
* perpetual: no maturity period.

===Coupon===

The coupon is the interest rate that the issuer pays to the holder. For fixed rate bonds, the coupon is fixed throughout the life of the bond. For floating rate notes, the coupon varies throughout the life of the bond and is based on the movement of a money market reference rate (historically this was generally LIBOR, but with its discontinuation the market reference rate has transitioned to SOFR).

Historically, coupons were physical attachments to the paper bond certificates, with each coupon representing an interest payment. On the interest due date, the bondholder would hand in the coupon to a bank in exchange for the interest payment. Today, interest payments are almost always paid electronically. Interest can be paid at different frequencies: generally semi-annual (every six months) or annual.

===Yield===
The yield is the rate of return received from investing in the bond. It usually refers to one of the following:
* The current yield, or running yield: the annual interest payment divided by the current market price of the bond (often the clean price).
* The yield to maturity (or redemption yield, as it is termed in the United Kingdom) is an estimate of the total rate of return anticipated to be earned by an investor who buys a bond at a given market price, holds it to maturity, and receives all interest payments and the capital redemption on schedule. It is a more useful measure of the return on a bond than current yield because it takes into account the present value of future interest payments and principal repaid at maturity. The yield to maturity or redemption yield calculated at the time of purchase is not necessarily the return the investor will actually earn, as finance scholars Dr. Annette Thau and Dr. Frank Fabozzi have noted. The yield to maturity will be realized only under certain conditions, including 1) all interest payments are reinvested rather than spent, and 2) all interest payments are reinvested at the yield to maturity calculated at the time the bond is purchased. This distinction may not be a concern to bond buyers who intend to spend rather than reinvest the coupon payments, such as those practicing asset/liability matching strategies.

===Credit quality===
The quality of the issue refers to the probability that the bondholders will receive the amounts promised at the due dates. In other words, credit quality tells investors how likely the borrower is going to default. This will depend on a wide range of factors.
High-yield bonds are bonds that are rated below investment grade by the credit rating agencies. As these bonds are riskier than investment grade bonds, investors expect to earn a higher yield. These bonds are also called &quot;junk bonds&quot;.

===Market price===
The market price of a tradable bond will be influenced, among other factors, by the amounts, currency and timing of the interest payments and capital repayment due, the quality of the bond, and the available redemption yield of other comparable bonds which can be traded in the markets.

The price can be quoted as clean or dirty. &quot;Dirty&quot; includes the present value of all future cash flows, including accrued interest, and is most often used in Europe. &quot;Clean&quot; does not include accrued interest, and is most often used in the U.S.

The issue price at which investors buy the bonds when they are first issued will typically be approximately equal to the nominal amount. The net proceeds that the issuer receives are thus the issue price, less issuance fees. The market price of the bond will vary over its life: it may trade at a premium (above par, usually because market interest rates have fallen since issue), or at a discount (price below par, if market rates have risen or there is a high probability of default on the bond).

===Others===
* Indentures and Covenants—An indenture is a formal debt agreement that establishes the terms of a bond issue, while covenants are the clauses of such an agreement. Covenants specify the rights of bondholders and the duties of issuers, such as actions that the issuer is obligated to perform or is prohibited from performing. In the U.S., federal and state securities and commercial laws apply to the enforcement of these agreements, which are construed by courts as contracts between issuers and bondholders. The terms may be changed only with great difficulty while the bonds are outstanding, with amendments to the governing document generally requiring approval by a majority (or super-majority) vote of the bondholders.
* Optionality: Occasionally a bond may contain an embedded option; that is, it grants option-like features to the holder or the issuer:
** Callability—Some bonds give the issuer the right to repay the bond before the maturity date on the call dates; see call option. These bonds are referred to as callable bonds. Most callable bonds allow the issuer to repay the bond at par. With some bonds, the issuer has to pay a premium, the so-called call premium. This is mainly the case for high-yield bonds. These have very strict covenants, restricting the issuer in its operations. To be free from these covenants, the issuer can repay the bonds early, but only at a high cost.
** Puttability—Some bonds give the holder the right to force the issuer to repay the bond before the maturity date on the put dates; see put option. These are referred to as retractable or putable bonds.
** Call dates and put dates—the dates on which callable and putable bonds can be redeemed early. There are four main categories:
*** A Bermudan callable has several call dates, usually coinciding with coupon dates.
*** A European callable has only one call date. This is a special case of a Bermudan callable.
*** An American callable can be called at any time until the maturity date.
*** A death put is an optional redemption feature on a debt instrument allowing the beneficiary of the estate of a deceased bondholder to put (sell) the bond back to the issuer at face value in the event of the bondholder&#x27;s death or legal incapacitation. This is also known as a &quot;survivor&#x27;s option&quot;.
** Sinking fund provision of the corporate bond indenture requires a certain portion of the issue to be retired periodically. The entire bond issue can be liquidated by the maturity date; if not, the remainder is called balloon maturity. Issuers may either pay to trustees, which in turn call randomly selected bonds in the issue, or, alternatively, purchase bonds in the open market, then return them to trustees.

==Types==
 

Bonds can be categorised in several ways, such as the type of issuer, the currency, the term of the bond (length of time to maturity) and the conditions applying to the bond. The following descriptions are not mutually exclusive, and more than one of them may apply to a particular bond:

===The nature of the issuer and the security offered===
The nature of the issuer will affect the security (certainty of receiving the contracted payments) offered by the bond, and sometimes the tax treatment.
* Government bonds, often also called treasury bonds, are issued by a sovereign national government. Some countries have repeatedly defaulted on their government bonds, while some other treasury bonds have been treated as risk-free and not exposed to default risk. Risk-free bonds are the safest bonds, with the lowest interest rate. A Treasury bond is backed by the &quot;full faith and credit&quot; of the relevant government. However, in reality most or all government bonds do carry some residual risk. This is indicated by
**the award by rating agencies of a rating below the top rating,
**bonds issued by different national governments, such as various member states of the European Union, all denominated in Euros, offering different market yields reflecting their different risks.
* A supranational bond, also known as a &quot;supra&quot;, is issued by a supranational organisation like the World Bank. They have a very good credit rating, similar to that on national government bonds.
* A municipal bond issued by a local authority or subdivision within a country, for example a city or a federal state. These will to varying degrees carry the backing of the national government. In the United States, such bonds are exempt from certain taxes. For example, Build America Bonds (BABs) are a form of municipal bond authorized by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Unlike traditional US municipal bonds, which are usually tax exempt, interest received on BABs is subject to federal taxation. However, as with municipal bonds, the bond is tax-exempt within the US state where it is issued. Generally, BABs offer significantly higher yields than standard municipal bonds.
** A revenue bond is a special type of municipal bond distinguished by its guarantee of repayment solely from revenues generated by a specified revenue-generating entity associated with the purpose of the bonds. Revenue bonds are typically &quot;non-recourse&quot;, meaning that in the event of default, the bond holder has no recourse to other governmental assets or revenues.
* A War bond is a bond issued by a government to fund military operations and other expenditure during wartime. It will often have a low return rate, and so can be bought due a lack of opportunities or patriotism. 
* Corporate bonds are issued by corporations.
* High-yield bonds (junk bonds) are bonds that are rated below investment grade by the credit rating agencies, because they are uncertain that the issuer will be able or willing to pay the scheduled interest payments and/or redeem the bond at maturity. As these bonds are much riskier than investment grade bonds, investors expect to earn a much higher yield.
* A Climate bond is a bond issued by a government or corporate entity in order to raise finance for climate change mitigation- or adaptation-related projects or programmes. For example, in 2021 the UK government started to issue &quot;green bonds&quot;. 
* Asset-backed securities are bonds whose interest and principal payments are backed by underlying cash flows from other assets. Examples of asset-backed securities are mortgage-backed securities (MBSs), collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).
* Covered bonds are backed by cash flows from mortgages or public sector assets. Unlike asset-backed securities, the assets for such bonds remain on the issuer&#x27;s balance sheet.
* Subordinated bonds are those that have a lower priority than other bonds of the issuer in case of liquidation. In case of bankruptcy, there is a hierarchy of creditors. First the liquidator is paid, then government taxes, etc. The first bond holders in line to be paid are those holding what are called senior bonds. After they have been paid, the subordinated bond holders are paid. As a result, the risk is higher. Therefore, subordinated bonds usually have a lower credit rating than senior bonds. The main examples of subordinated bonds can be found in bonds issued by banks and asset-backed securities. The latter are often issued in tranches. The senior tranches get paid back first, the subordinated tranches later.
* Social impact bonds are an agreement for public sector entities to pay back private investors after meeting verified improved social outcome goals that result in public sector savings from innovative social program pilot projects.

===The term of the bond===
* Most bonds are structured to mature on a stated date, when the principal is due to be repaid, and interest payments cease. Typically, a bond with term to maturity of under five years would be called a short bond; 5 to 15 years would be &quot;medium&quot;, and over 15 years would be &quot;long&quot;; but the numbers may vary in different markets.
* Perpetual bonds are also often called perpetuities or &#x27;Perps&#x27;. They have no maturity date. Historically the most famous of these were the UK Consols (there were also some other perpetual UK government bonds, such as War Loan, Treasury Annuities and undated Treasuries). Some of these were issued back in 1888 or earlier. There had been insignificant quantities of these outstanding for decades, and they have now been fully repaid. Some ultra-long-term bonds (sometimes a bond can last centuries: West Shore Railroad issued a bond which matures in 2361 (i.e. 24th century)) are virtually perpetuities from a financial point of view, with the current value of principal near zero.
* The &quot;Methuselah&quot; is a type of bond with a maturity of 50 years or longer. The term is a reference to Methuselah, the oldest person whose age is mentioned in the Hebrew Bible. The issuance of Methuselahs has been increasing in recent years due to demand for longer-dated assets from pension plans, particularly in France and the United Kingdom. Issuance of Methuselahs in the United States has been limited, however: the U.S. Treasury does not currently issue Treasuries with maturities beyond 30 years, which would serve as a reference level for any corporate issuance.
* A Serial bond is a bond that matures in installments over a period of time. For example, a $100,000, 5-year serial bond might pay $20,000 per year.

===The conditions applying to the bond===

* Fixed rate bonds have interest payments (&quot;coupon&quot;), usually semi-annual, that remains constant throughout the life of the bond. Other variations include stepped-coupon bonds, whose coupon increases during the life of the bond.
* Floating rate notes (FRNs, floaters) have a variable coupon that is linked to a reference rate of interest, such as Libor or Euribor. For example, the coupon may be defined as three-month USD LIBOR + 0.20%. The coupon rate is recalculated periodically, typically every one or three months.
* Zero-coupon bonds (zeros) pay no regular interest. They are issued at a substantial discount to par value, so that the interest is effectively rolled up to maturity (and usually taxed as such). The bondholder receives the full principal amount on the redemption date. An example of zero coupon bonds is Series E savings bonds issued by the U.S. government. Zero-coupon bonds may be created from fixed rate bonds by a financial institution separating (&quot;stripping off&quot;) the coupons from the principal. This can create a &quot;Principal Only&quot; zero-coupon bond and an &quot;Interest Only&quot; (IO) strip bond from the original fixed income bond. 
* Inflation-indexed bonds (linkers) (US) or index-linked bonds (UK), in which the principal amount and the interest payments are indexed to the level of consumer prices. The interest rate is normally lower than for fixed rate bonds with a comparable maturity (this relationship briefly reversed for short-term UK bonds in December 2008). Higher inflation rates increase the nominal principal and coupon amounts paid on these bonds. The United Kingdom was the first sovereign issuer to issue inflation-linked gilts in the 1980s. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) and I-bonds are examples of inflation-linked bonds issued by the U.S. government.
* Other indexed bonds, for example equity-linked notes and bonds indexed on a business indicator (income, added value) or on a country&#x27;s GDP.
* Lottery bonds are issued by European and other states. Interest is paid as on a traditional fixed rate bond, but the issuer will redeem randomly selected individual bonds within the issue according to a schedule. Some of these redemptions will be for a higher value than the face value of the bond.

===Bonds with embedded options for the holder===
* Convertible bonds let a bondholder exchange a bond to a number of shares of the issuer&#x27;s common stock. These are known as hybrid securities, because they combine equity and debt features.
* Exchangeable bonds allows for exchange to shares of a corporation other than the issuer.

===Documentation and evidence of title===

* A bearer bond is an official certificate issued without a named holder. In other words, the person who has the paper certificate can claim the value of the bond. Often they are registered by a number to prevent counterfeiting, but may be traded like cash. Bearer bonds are very risky because they can be lost or stolen. In some countries they were historically popular because the owner could not be traced by the tax authorities. For example, after federal income tax began in the United States, bearer bonds were seen as an opportunity to conceal income or assets. U.S. corporations stopped issuing bearer bonds in the 1960s, the U.S. Treasury stopped in 1982, and state and local tax-exempt bearer bonds were prohibited in 1983.
* A registered bond is a bond whose ownership (and any subsequent purchaser) is recorded by the issuer, or by a transfer agent. Interest payments and the principal upon maturity are sent to the registered owner. The owner can continue to receive interest with a duplicated bond in case of a loss. However, the bond is not easily transferable to other people. Registered bonds seldom appeared in the market for trading. The traceability of the bonds means it has a minor effect on bond prices. Once a new owner acquired the bond, the old bond must be sent to the corporation or agent for cancellation and for issuance of a new bond. It is the opposite of a bearer bond.
* A book-entry bond is a bond that does not have a paper certificate. As physically processing paper bonds and interest coupons became more expensive, issuers (and banks that used to collect coupon interest for depositors) have tried to discourage their use. Some book-entry bond issues do not offer the option of a paper certificate, even to investors who prefer them.

===Retail bonds===
* Retail bonds are a type of corporate bond mostly designed for ordinary investors.

===Foreign currencies===

Some companies, banks, governments, and other sovereign entities may decide to issue bonds in foreign currencies as the foreign currency may appear to potential investors to be more stable and predictable than their domestic currency. Issuing bonds denominated in foreign currencies also gives issuers the ability to access investment capital available in foreign markets.

A downside is that the government loses the option to reduce its bond liabilities by inflating its domestic currency.

The proceeds from the issuance of these bonds can be used by companies to break into foreign markets, or can be converted into the issuing company&#x27;s local currency to be used on existing operations through the use of foreign exchange swap hedges. Foreign issuer bonds can also be used to hedge foreign exchange rate risk. Some foreign issuer bonds are called by their nicknames, such as the &quot;samurai bond&quot;. These can be issued by foreign issuers looking to diversify their investor base away from domestic markets. These bond issues are generally governed by the law of the market of issuance, e.g., a samurai bond, issued by an investor based in Europe, will be governed by Japanese law. Not all of the following bonds are restricted for purchase by investors in the market of issuance.

==Bond valuation==
The market price of a bond is the present value of all expected future interest and principal payments of the bond, here discounted at the bond&#x27;s yield to maturity (i.e. rate of return). That relationship is the definition of the redemption yield on the bond, which is likely to be close to the current market interest rate for other bonds with similar characteristics, as otherwise there would be arbitrage opportunities. The yield and price of a bond are inversely related so that when market interest rates rise, bond prices fall and vice versa. For a discussion of the mathematics see Bond valuation.

The bond&#x27;s market price is usually expressed as a percentage of nominal value: 100% of face value, &quot;at par&quot;, corresponds to a price of 100; prices can be above par (bond is priced at greater than 100), which is called trading at a premium, or below par (bond is priced at less than 100), which is called trading at a discount. The market price of a bond may be quoted including the accrued interest since the last coupon date. (Some bond markets include accrued interest in the trading price and others add it on separately when settlement is made.) The price including accrued interest is known as the &quot;full&quot; or &quot;dirty price&quot;. (&quot;See also&quot; Accrual bond.) The price excluding accrued interest is known as the &quot;flat&quot; or &quot;clean price&quot;.

Most government bonds are denominated in units of $1000 in the United States, or in units of £100 in the United Kingdom. Hence, a deep discount US bond, selling at a price of 75.26, indicates a selling price of $752.60 per bond sold. (Often, in the US, bond prices are quoted in points and thirty-seconds of a point, rather than in decimal form.) Some short-term bonds, such as the U.S. Treasury bill, are always issued at a discount, and pay par amount at maturity rather than paying coupons. This is called a discount bond.

Although bonds are not necessarily issued at par (100% of face value, corresponding to a price of 100), their prices will move towards par as they approach maturity (if the market expects the maturity payment to be made in full and on time) as this is the price the issuer will pay to redeem the bond. This is referred to as &quot;pull to par&quot;. At the time of issue of the bond, the coupon paid, and other conditions of the bond, will have been influenced by a variety of factors, such as current market interest rates, the length of the term and the creditworthiness of the issuer. These factors are likely to change over time, so the market price of a bond will vary after it is issued. (The position is a bit more complicated for inflation-linked bonds.)

The interest payment (&quot;coupon payment&quot;) divided by the current price of the bond is called the current yield (this is the nominal yield multiplied by the par value and divided by the price). There are other yield measures that exist such as the yield to first call, yield to worst, yield to first par call, yield to put, cash flow yield and yield to maturity. The relationship between yield and term to maturity (or alternatively between yield and the weighted mean term allowing for both interest and capital repayment) for otherwise identical bonds derives the yield curve, a graph plotting this relationship.

If the bond includes embedded options, the valuation is more difficult and combines option pricing with discounting. Depending on the type of option, the option price as calculated is either added to or subtracted from the price of the &quot;straight&quot; portion. See further under . This total is then the value of the bond. More sophisticated lattice- or simulation-based techniques may (also) be employed.

Bond markets, unlike stock or share markets, sometimes do not have a centralized exchange or trading system. Rather, in most developed bond markets such as the U.S., Japan and western Europe, bonds trade in decentralized, dealer-based over-the-counter markets. In such a market, liquidity is provided by dealers and other market participants committing risk capital to trading activity. In the bond market, when an investor buys or sells a bond, the counterparty to the trade is almost always a bank or securities firm acting as a dealer. In some cases, when a dealer buys a bond from an investor, the dealer carries the bond &quot;in inventory&quot;, i.e. holds it for their own account. The dealer is then subject to risks of price fluctuation. In other cases, the dealer immediately resells the bond to another investor.

==Investing in bonds==
Bonds are bought and traded mostly by institutions like central banks, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, insurance companies, hedge funds, and banks. Insurance companies and pension funds have liabilities which essentially include fixed amounts payable on predetermined dates. They buy the bonds to match their liabilities, and may be compelled by law to do this. Most individuals who want to own bonds do so through bond funds. Still, in the U.S., nearly 10% of all bonds outstanding are held directly by households.

The volatility of bonds (especially short and medium dated bonds) is lower than that of equities (stocks). Thus, bonds are generally viewed as safer investments than equities, but this perception is only partially correct. Bonds do suffer from less day-to-day volatility than stocks, and bonds&#x27; interest payments are sometimes higher than the general level of dividend payments. Bonds are often liquid – it is often fairly easy for an institution to sell a large quantity of bonds without affecting the price much, which may be more difficult for equities – and the comparative certainty of a fixed interest payment twice a year and a fixed lump sum at maturity is attractive. Bondholders also enjoy a measure of legal protection: under the law of most countries, if a company goes bankrupt, its bondholders will often receive some money back (the recovery amount), whereas the company&#x27;s equity stock often ends up valueless. However, bonds can also be risky but less risky than stocks:
* Fixed rate bonds are subject to &quot;interest rate risk&quot;, meaning that their market prices will decrease in value when the generally prevailing interest rates rise. Since the payments are fixed, a decrease in the market price of the bond means an increase in its yield. When the market interest rate rises, the market price of bonds will fall, reflecting investors&#x27; ability to get a higher interest rate on their money elsewhere—perhaps by purchasing a newly issued bond that already features the newly higher interest rate. This does not affect the interest payments to the bondholder, so long-term investors who want a specific amount at the maturity date do not need to worry about price swings in their bonds and do not suffer from interest rate risk.

Bonds are also subject to various other risks such as call and prepayment risk, credit risk, reinvestment risk, liquidity risk, event risk, exchange rate risk, volatility risk, inflation risk, sovereign risk and yield curve risk. Again, some of these will only affect certain classes of investors.

Price changes in a bond will immediately affect mutual funds that hold these bonds. If the value of the bonds in their trading portfolio falls, the value of the portfolio also falls. This can be damaging for professional investors such as banks, insurance companies, pension funds and asset managers (irrespective of whether the value is immediately &quot;marked to market&quot; or not).
If there is any chance a holder of individual bonds may need to sell their bonds and &quot;cash out&quot;, interest rate risk could become a real problem, conversely, bonds&#x27; market prices would increase if the prevailing interest rate were to drop, as it did from 2001 through 2003. One way to quantify the interest rate risk on a bond is in terms of its duration. Efforts to control this risk are called immunization or hedging.
* Bond prices can become volatile depending on the credit rating of the issuer – for instance if the credit rating agencies like Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s and Moody&#x27;s upgrade or downgrade the credit rating of the issuer. An unanticipated downgrade will cause the market price of the bond to fall. As with interest rate risk, this risk does not affect the bond&#x27;s interest payments (provided the issuer does not actually default), but puts at risk the market price, which affects mutual funds holding these bonds, and holders of individual bonds who may have to sell them.
* A company&#x27;s bondholders may lose much or all their money if the company goes bankrupt. Under the laws of many countries (including the United States and Canada), bondholders are in line to receive the proceeds of the sale of the assets of a liquidated company ahead of some other creditors. Bank lenders, deposit holders (in the case of a deposit taking institution such as a bank) and trade creditors may take precedence.
There is no guarantee of how much money will remain to repay bondholders. As an example, after an accounting scandal and a Chapter 11 bankruptcy at the giant telecommunications company Worldcom, in 2004 its bondholders ended up being paid 35.7 cents on the dollar. In a bankruptcy involving reorganization or recapitalization, as opposed to liquidation, bondholders may end up having the value of their bonds reduced, often through an exchange for a smaller number of newly issued bonds.
* Some bonds are callable, meaning that even though the company has agreed to make payments plus interest towards the debt for a certain period of time, the company can choose to pay off the bond early. This creates reinvestment risk, meaning the investor is forced to find a new place for their money, and the investor might not be able to find as good a deal, especially because this usually happens when interest rates are falling.

===Bond indices===

A number of bond indices exist for the purposes of managing portfolios and measuring performance, similar to the S&amp;P 500 or Russell Indexes for companies&#x27; shares. The most common American benchmarks are the Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate (ex Lehman Aggregate), Citigroup BIG and Merrill Lynch Domestic Master. Most indices are parts of families of broader indices that can be used to measure global bond portfolios, or may be further subdivided by maturity or sector for managing specialized portfolios.

<text>The House of Piast was the first historical ruling dynasty of Poland. The first documented Polish monarch was Duke Mieszko I (–992). The Piasts&#x27; royal rule in Poland ended in 1370 with the death of King Casimir III the Great.

Branches of the Piast dynasty continued to rule in the Duchy of Masovia (until 1526) and in the Duchies of Silesia until the last male Silesian Piast died in 1675. The Piasts intermarried with several noble lines of Europe, and possessed numerous titles, some within the Holy Roman Empire. The Jagiellonian kings ruling after the death of Casimir IV of Poland were also descended in the female line from Casimir III&#x27;s daughter.

== Origin of the name ==
The early dukes and kings of Poland are said to have regarded themselves as descendants of the semi-legendary Piast the Wheelwright (&quot;Piast Kołodziej&quot;), first mentioned in the &quot;Cronicae et gesta ducum sive principum Polonorum&quot; (Chronicles and deeds of the dukes or princes of the Poles), written c. 1113 by Gallus Anonymus. However, the term &quot;Piast Dynasty&quot; was not applied until the 17th century. In a historical work, the expression Piast dynasty was introduced by the Polish historian Adam Naruszewicz; it is not documented in contemporary sources.

== History ==

The first &quot;Piasts&quot;, probably of Polan descent, appeared around 940 in the territory of Greater Poland at the stronghold of Giecz. Shortly afterwards they relocated their residence to Gniezno, where Prince Mieszko I ruled over the &quot;Civitas Schinesghe&quot; from about 960. The Piasts temporarily also ruled over Pomerania, Bohemia and the Lusatias, as well as part of Ruthenia, and the Hungarian Spiš region in present-day Slovakia. The ruler bore the title of a duke or a king, depending on their position of power.

The Polish monarchy had to deal with the expansionist policies of the Holy Roman Empire in the west, resulting in a chequered co-existence, with Piast rulers like Mieszko I, Casimir I the Restorer or Władysław I Herman trying to protect the Polish state by treaties, oath of allegiances and marriage alliances with the Imperial Ottonian and Salian dynasties. The Bohemian Přemyslid dynasty, the Hungarian Arpads and their Anjou successors, the Kievan Rus&#x27;, later also the State of the Teutonic Order and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania were mighty neighbours.

The Piast position was decisively enfeebled by an era of fragmentation following the 1138 Testament of Bolesław III Wrymouth. For nearly 150 years, the Polish state shattered into several duchies, with the Piast duke against the formally valid principle of agnatic seniority fighting for the throne at Kraków, the capital of the Lesser Polish Seniorate Province. Numerous dukes like Mieszko III the Old, Władysław III Spindleshanks or Leszek I the White were crowned, only to be overthrown shortly afterwards, and others restored and ousted, at times repeatedly. The senior branch of the Silesian Piasts, descendants of Bolesław III Wrymouth&#x27;s eldest son Duke Władysław II the Exile, went separate ways and since the 14th century were vassals of the Bohemian Crown.

After the Polish royal line and Piast junior branch had died out in 1370, the Polish crown fell to the Anjou king Louis I of Hungary, son of late King Casimir&#x27;s sister Elizabeth Piast. The Masovian branch of the Piasts became extinct with the death of Duke Janusz III in 1526. The last ruling duke of the Silesian Piasts was George William of Legnica who died in 1675. His uncle Count August of Legnica, the last male Piast, died in 1679. The last legitimate heir, Duchess Karolina of Legnica-Brieg died in 1707 and is buried in Trzebnica Abbey. Nevertheless, numerous families, like the illegitimate descendants of the Silesian duke Adam Wenceslaus of Cieszyn (1574–1617), link their genealogy to the dynasty.

==Coat of arms==

About 1295, Przemysł II used a coat of arms with a white eagle – a symbol later referred to as the Piast coat of arms or as the Piast Eagle.
The Silesian Piasts in the 14th century used an eagle modified by a crescent, which became the coat of arms of the Duchy of Silesia.

<text>Poitou ( , , ; ; Poitevin: &quot;Poetou&quot;) was a province of west-central France whose capital city was Poitiers. Both Poitou and Poitiers are named after the Pictones Gallic tribe.

==Geography==

The main historical cities are Poitiers (historical capital city), Châtellerault (France&#x27;s kings&#x27; establishment in Poitou), Niort, La Roche-sur-Yon, Thouars, and Parthenay.

==History==

Historically Poitou was ruled by the count of Poitou, a continuous line of which can be traced back to an appointment of Charlemagne in 778. A marshland called the Poitevin Marsh (French &quot;Marais Poitevin&quot;) is located along the Gulf of Poitou, on the west coast of France, just north of La Rochelle and west of Niort.

At the conclusion of the Battle of Taillebourg in the Saintonge War, which was decisively won by the French, King Henry III of England recognized his loss of continental Plantagenet territory to France. This was ratified by the Treaty of Paris of 1259, by which King Louis annexed Normandy, Maine, Anjou, and Poitou).

During the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, Poitou was a hotbed of Huguenot (French Calvinist Protestant) activity among the nobility and bourgeoisie. The Protestants were discriminated against and brutally attacked during the French Wars of Religion (1562–1598). Under the Edict of Nantes, such discrimination was temporarily suspended but this measure was repealed by the French Crown.

Some of the French colonists, later known as Acadians, who settled beginning in 1604 in eastern North America came from southern Poitou. They established settlements in what is now Nova Scotia, and later in New Brunswick—both of which were taken over in the later 18th century by the English, (after their 1763 victory in the Seven Years&#x27; War).

After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685, the French Roman Catholic Church conducted a strong Counter-Reformation effort. In 1793, this effort had contributed to the three-year-long open revolt against the French Revolutionary Government in the Bas-Poitou (Département of Vendée). Similarly, during Napoleon&#x27;s Hundred Days in 1815, the Vendée stayed loyal to the Restoration Monarchy of King Louis XVIII. Napoleon dispatched 10,000 troops under General Lamarque to pacify the region.

As noted by historian Andre Lampert: 
&quot;The persistent Huguenots of 17th Century Poitou and the fiercely Catholic rebellious Royalists of what came be the Vendée of the late 18th Century had ideologies very different, indeed diametrically opposed to each other. The common thread connecting both phenomena is a continuing assertion of a local identity and opposition to the central government in Paris, whatever its composition and identity. (...) In the region where Louis XIII and Louis XIV had encountered stiff resistance, the House of Bourbon gained loyal and militant supporters exactly when it had been overthrown and when a Bourbon loyalty came to imply a local loyalty in opposition to the new central government, that of Robespierre.&quot;

==In fiction==

* Large parts of the &quot;Angélique&quot; series of historical novels are set in 17th century Poitou.

* In Alexandre Dumas&#x27;s &quot;The Man in the Iron Mask&quot;, Aramis gives a romantic description of the marshes of Bas-Poitou as the most secluded place to lead a quiet life away from the perils of court.

* The movie &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot; features Guy of Lusignan, a knight from Poitou.

<doc id="60741" wikidata="Q254374" url="?curid=60741" title="Judith of Swabia">
<text>Judith of Swabia (, ; Summer 1054 – 14 March ca. 1105?), a member of the Salian dynasty, was the youngest daughter of Emperor Henry III from his second marriage with Agnes of Poitou. By her two marriages she was Queen of Hungary from 1063 to 1074 and Duchess of Poland from 1089 to 1102.

==Early life==
Born probably at the Imperial Palace of Goslar, Judith was the youngest of the six children born to Emperor Henry III and Empress Agnes. Soon after her birth on 9 April 1054, Judith was betrothed to Philip, eldest son of King Henry I of France. However, after the death of Emperor Henry III on 5 October 1056, with Empress Agnes acting as regent on behalf of her minor son, King Henry IV, the engagement was broken in September 1058, when a peace treaty was concluded with King Andrew I of Hungary. Emperor Henry III had waged two unsuccessful campaigns against Hungary in 1051 and 1052, whereafter Pope Leo IX arranged an agreement. As a part of the new alliance, Judith was engaged to the Hungarian king&#x27;s son Solomon at the Bavarian court in Regensburg. When King Andrew I died in 1060, his widow and sons had to take refuge in Germany. Nevertheless, with the support of his powerful brother-in-law, Solomon could recover the Hungarian throne after the death of his uncle Béla I in 1063 and soon after married with Judith in Székesfehérvár.

==Queen of Hungary==
Judith&#x27;s marriage to Solomon proved to be unsuccessful, and apparently both the king and queen had love affairs. Although it is generally believed that the union was childless, some sources state that Solomon and Judith had a daughter, Sophia, who later married Count Poppo of Berg-Schelklingen.

During the 1070s, a struggle for power commenced between King Solomon and his cousins (Geza and Ladislaus, sons of the late Béla I). On 14 March 1074 at the Battle of Mogyoród, the king&#x27;s forces were decisively defeated by his cousins and their allies, the Dukes of Poland and Bohemia. Judith fled back to Germany, while Solomon continued his fight for the Hungarian throne; in 1077 he accepted the rule of his cousin King László I, who gave him in exchange extensive landholdings after his formal abdication (1081). Despite this, Solomon never gave up his pretensions and began to plot against King László I; however, his plans were discovered and he was imprisoned by the King in the Tower of Visegrád until 15 August 1083, when on the occasion of the canonization of Stephen I, the first king of Hungary, Solomon was released.

In the meantime, Judith remained in Germany and settled in her residence in Regensburg (with short breaks) from May or July 1074 until 1088. After his release, Solomon went to Germany and tried to reunite with his wife, but she refused to receive him. After a long wandering, Solomon made an alliance with Kuteshk, the leader of a Pecheneg tribe settled in the later principality of Moldavia. Between 1084-1085 he married his daughter, committing bigamy with this act.

Solomon promised to hand over parts of the kingdom of Hungary in exchange for his new father-in-law&#x27;s military assistance. In 1085, Solomon led the Pecheneg troops against Hungary, but King Ladislaus I defeated them. Two years later, in 1087, Solomon took part in the Pechenegs&#x27; campaign against the Byzantine Empire and was killed in a battle near Hadrianopolis.

==Duchess of Poland==
In 1089, Judith married Duke Władysław Herman of Poland. This union considerably benefited German-Polish relations; on the occasion of the wedding, Emperor Henry IV commissioned to St. Emmeram&#x27;s Abbey in Regensburg the creation of Gospel Books to the Polish court, now kept in the library of the Wawel Cathedral chapter in Kraków. After her marriage, Judith changed her name to Sophia, perhaps to distinguish herself from Władysław I&#x27;s first wife, Judith of Bohemia. Judith of Swabia&#x27;s daughters with Władysław were Sophia(?) (who married Prince Yaroslav Sviatopolkovich of Vladimir-Volynia), Agnes (later abbess of Quedlinburg and Gandersheim), and the wife of a Polish lord whose name is not known. According to older historians his third daughter did not marry a Polish lord, but was Adelaide (who married Margrave Diepold III of Vohburg).

Judith probably had a big impact on Poland&#x27;s political life. It is believed that she was the mistress of Sieciech, the count palatine and true governor of the country. Judith actively aided Sieciech in his schemes to take over the country; the death of Mieszko Bolesławowic under mysterious circumstances was, in all probability, caused by orders of the Count Palatine and Judith. With the help of Sieciech, Judith convinced her husband to send Władysław I&#x27;s first-born son Zbigniew (who seems to be a strong candidate to the succession despite his illegitimacy) to Quedlinburg Abbey where her sister Adelaide was abbess; also, they wanted an eventual alliance with the only legitimate son of Władysław I, Bolesław Wrymouth, born from his first marriage with Judith of Bohemia.

After discovering the plans of Sieciech and Judith to take over the country, Bolesław and Zbigniew became allies. Both brothers demanded that the reigns of government should be handed over to them. Eventually, after some attempts to break the alliance between the brothers, Sieciech was defeated, deposed and exiled (ca. 1100–1101). On 4 June 1102 Duke Władysław I died. The country was divided between Bolesław III and Zbigniew.

Judith&#x27;s date of death was disputed among historians and web sources. Although 14 March is stated as the correct day in almost all the known sources, in the case of the year is more difficult to ascertain. Sources established that she died between 1092–1096, but this seems improbable, because is known that around 1105, Bolesław III entered into an agreement with her, under which, in exchange for abundant dower lands, Judith guaranteed her neutrality in the Duke&#x27;s political contest with his half-brother Zbigniew. Thus, she died after that date. Gerard Labuda stated that Judith spent her last years of life in Regensburg with her (supposed) daughter Adelaide, wife of Count Dietpold III of Vohburg and Cham; since the date of the marriage between Adelaide and Count Dietpold III was ranked between 1110–1118, it is assumed that Judith died after the latter year, at a relatively advanced age. Her place of burial, Admont Abbey in Austria, apparently confirm this theory.

<doc id="60744" wikidata="Q225666" url="?curid=60744" title="Cubic zirconia">
<text>Cubic zirconia (abbreviated &quot;CZ&quot;) is the cubic crystalline form of zirconium dioxide (ZrO2). The synthesized material is hard and usually colorless, but may be made in a variety of different colors. It should not be confused with zircon, which is a zirconium silicate (ZrSiO4). It is sometimes erroneously called &quot;cubic zirconium&quot;.

Because of its low cost, durability, and close visual likeness to diamond, synthetic cubic zirconia has remained the most gemologically and economically important competitor for diamonds since commercial production began in 1976. Its main competitor as a synthetic gemstone is a more recently cultivated material, synthetic moissanite.

==Technical aspects==
Cubic zirconia is crystallographically isometric, an important attribute of a would-be diamond simulant. During synthesis zirconium oxide naturally forms monoclinic crystals, which are stable under normal atmospheric conditions. A stabilizer is required for cubic crystals (taking on the fluorite structure) to form, and remain stable at ordinary temperatures; typically this is either yttrium or calcium oxide, the amount of stabilizer used depending on the many recipes of individual manufacturers. Therefore, the physical and optical properties of synthesized CZ vary, all values being ranges.

It is a dense substance, with a density between 5.6 and 6.0 g/cm3—about 1.65 times that of diamond. Cubic zirconia is relatively hard, 8–8.5 on the Mohs scale—slightly harder than most semi-precious natural gems. Its refractive index is high at 2.15–2.18 (compared to 2.42 for diamonds) and its luster is Adamantine lustre. Its dispersion is very high at 0.058–0.066, exceeding that of diamond (0.044). Cubic zirconia has no cleavage and exhibits a conchoidal fracture. Because of its high hardness, it is generally considered brittle.

Under shortwave UV cubic zirconia typically fluoresces a yellow, greenish yellow or &quot;beige&quot;. Under longwave UV the effect is greatly diminished, with a whitish glow sometimes being seen. Colored stones may show a strong, complex rare earth absorption spectrum.

==History==
Discovered in 1892, the yellowish monoclinic mineral baddeleyite is a natural form of zirconium oxide.

The high melting point of zirconia (2750 °C or 4976 °F) hinders controlled growth of single crystals. However, stabilization of cubic zirconium oxide had been realized early on, with the synthetic product &quot;stabilized zirconia&quot; introduced in 1929. Although cubic, it was in the form of a polycrystalline ceramic: it was used as a refractory material, highly resistant to chemical and thermal attack (up to 2540 °C or 4604 °F).

In 1937, German mineralogists M. V. Stackelberg and K. Chudoba discovered naturally occurring cubic zirconia in the form of microscopic grains included in metamict zircon. This was thought to be a byproduct of the metamictization process, but the two scientists did not think the mineral important enough to give it a formal name. The discovery was confirmed through X-ray diffraction, proving the existence of a natural counterpart to the synthetic product.

As with the majority of grown diamond substitutes, the idea of producing single-crystal cubic zirconia arose in the minds of scientists seeking a new and versatile material for use in lasers and other optical applications. Its production eventually exceeded that of earlier synthetics, such as synthetic strontium titanate, synthetic rutile, YAG (yttrium aluminium garnet) and GGG (gadolinium gallium garnet).

Some of the earliest research into controlled single-crystal growth of cubic zirconia occurred in 1960s France, much work being done by Y. Roulin and R. Collongues. This technique involved molten zirconia being contained within a thin shell of still-solid zirconia, with crystal growth from the melt. The process was named &quot;cold crucible&quot;, an allusion to the system of water cooling used. Though promising, these attempts yielded only small crystals.

Later, Soviet scientists under V. V. Osiko in the Laser Equipment Laboratory at the Lebedev Physical Institute in Moscow perfected the technique, which was then named &quot;skull crucible&quot; (an allusion either to the shape of the water-cooled container or to the form of crystals sometimes grown). They named the jewel &quot;Fianit&quot; after the institute&#x27;s name FIAN (Physical Institute of the Academy of Science), but the name was not used outside of the USSR. This was known at the time as the Institute of Physics at the Russian Academy of Science. Their breakthrough was published in 1973, and commercial production began in 1976. In 1977, cubic zirconia began to be mass-produced in the jewelry marketplace by the Ceres Corporation, with crystals stabilized with 94% yttria. Other major producers as of 1993 include Taiwan Crystal Company Ltd, Swarovski and ICT inc. By 1980, annual global production had reached 60 million carats (12 tonnes) and continued to increase, with production reaching around 400 tonnes per year in 1998.

Because the natural form of cubic zirconia is so rare, all cubic zirconia used in jewelry has been synthesized, one method of which was patented by Josep F. Wenckus &amp; Co. in 1997.

==Synthesis==
The skull-melting method refined by Josep F. Wenckus and coworkers in 1997 remains the industry standard. This is largely due to the process allowing for temperatures of over 3000  °C to be achieved, lack of contact between crucible and material as well as the freedom to choose any gas atmosphere. Primary downsides to this method include the inability to predict the size of the crystals produced and it is impossible to control the crystallization process through temperature changes.

The apparatus used in this process consists of a cup-shaped crucible surrounded by radio frequency-activated (RF-activated) copper coils and a water-cooling system.

Zirconium dioxide thoroughly mixed with a stabilizer (normally 10% yttrium oxide) is fed into a cold crucible. Metallic chips of either zirconium or the stabilizer are introduced into the powder mix in a compact pile manner. The RF generator is switched on and the metallic chips quickly start heating up and readily oxidize into more zirconia. Consequently, the surrounding powder heats up by thermal conduction, begins melting and, in turn, becomes electroconductive, and thus it begins to heat up via the RF generator as well. This continues until the entire product is molten. Due to the cooling system surrounding the crucible, a thin shell of sintered solid material is formed. This causes the molten zirconia to remain contained within its own powder which prevents it from being contaminated from the crucible and reduces heat loss. The melt is left at high temperatures for some hours to ensure homogeneity and ensure that all impurities have evaporated. Finally, the entire crucible is slowly removed from the RF coils to reduce the heating and let it slowly cool down (from bottom to top). The rate at which the crucible is removed from the RF coils is chosen as a function of the stability of crystallization dictated by the phase transition diagram. This provokes the crystallization process to begin and useful crystals begin to form. Once the crucible has been completely cooled to room temperature, the resulting crystals are multiple elongated-crystalline blocks.

This shape is dictated by a concept known as crystal degeneration according to Tiller. The size and diameter of the obtained crystals is a function of the cross-sectional area of the crucible, volume of the melt and composition of the melt. The diameter of the crystals is heavily influenced by the concentration of Y2O3 stabilizer.

=== Phase relations in zirconia solids solutions ===
As seen on the phase diagram, the cubic phase will crystallize first as the solution is cooled down no matter the concentration of Y2O3. If the concentration of Y2O3 is not high enough the cubic structure will start to break down into the tetragonal state which will then break down into a monoclinic phase. If the concentration of Y2O3 is between 2.5-5% the resulting product will be PSZ (partially stabilized zirconia) while monophasic cubic crystals will form from around 8-40%. Below 14% at low growth rates tend to be opaque indicating partial phase separation in the solid solution (likely due to diffusion in the crystals remaining in the high temperature region for a longer time). Above this threshold crystals tend to remain clear at reasonable growth rates and maintains good annealing conditions.

=== Doping ===
Because of cubic zirconia&#x27;s isomorphic capacity, it can be doped with several elements to change the color of the crystal. A list of specific dopants and colors produced by their addition can be seen below.

=== Primary growth defects ===
The vast majority of YCZ (yttrium bearing cubic zirconia) crystals are clear with high optical perfection and with gradients of the refractive index lower than formula_1. However some samples contain defects with the most characteristic and common ones listed below.

* Growth striations: These are located perpendicular to the growth direction of the crystal and are caused mainly by either fluctuations in the crystal growth rate or the non-congruent nature of liquid-solid transition, thus leading to non-uniform distribution of Y2O3.
* Light-scattering phase inclusions: Caused by contaminants in the crystal (primarily precipitates of silicates or aluminates of yttrium), typically of magnitude 0.03-10 μm.
* Mechanical stresses: Typically caused by the high temperature gradients of the growth and cooling processes, causing the crystal to form with internal mechanical stresses acting on it. This causes refractive index values of up to formula_2, although the effect of this can be reduced by annealing at 2100 °C followed by a slow enough cooling process.
* Dislocations: Similar to mechanical stresses, dislocations can be greatly reduced by annealing.

== Uses outside jewelry ==
Due to its optical properties yttrium cubic zirconia (YCZ) has been used for windows, lenses, prisms, filters and laser elements. Particularly in the chemical industry it is used as window material for the monitoring of corrosive liquids due to its chemical stability and mechanical toughness. YCZ has also been used as a substrate for semiconductor and superconductor films in similar industries.

Mechanical properties of partially stabilized zirconia (high hardness and shock resistance, low friction coefficient, high chemical and thermal resistance as well as high wear and tear resistance) allow it to be used as a very particular building material, especially in the bio-engineering industry: It has been used to make reliable super-sharp medical scalpels for doctors that are compatible with bio-tissues and contain an edge much smoother than one made of steel.

==Innovations==
In recent years manufacturers have sought ways of distinguishing their product by supposedly &quot;improving&quot; cubic zirconia. Coating finished cubic zirconia with a film of diamond-like carbon (DLC) is one such innovation, a process using chemical vapor deposition. The resulting material is purportedly harder, more lustrous and more like diamond overall. The coating is thought to quench the excess fire of cubic zirconia, while improving its refractive index, thus making it appear more like diamond. Additionally, because of the high percentage of diamond bonds in the amorphous diamond coating, the finished simulant will show a positive diamond signature in Raman spectra.

Another technique first applied to quartz and topaz has also been adapted to cubic zirconia: An iridescent effect created by vacuum-sputtering onto finished stones an extremely thin layer of a precious metal (typically gold), or certain metal oxides, metal nitrides, or other coatings. This material is marketed as &quot;mystic&quot; by many dealers. Unlike diamond-like carbon and other hard synthetic ceramic coatings, the iridescent effect made with precious metal coatings is not durable, due to their extremely low hardness and poor abrasion wear properties, compared to the remarkably durable cubic zirconia substrate.

==Cubic zirconia vis-à-vis diamond==
Key features of cubic zirconia distinguish it from diamond:

*Hardness: cubic zirconia has a rating of approximately 8 on Mohs hardness scale vs. a rating of 10 for diamond. This may cause dull and rounded edges in CZ facets; the edges of diamond facets are much sharper by comparison. Furthermore, diamond rarely shows polish marks, and those which are apparent are oriented in different directions on adjoining facets, whereas CZ shows marks in the same direction of the polish throughout.
*The Specific gravity or density of cubic zirconia is approximately 1.7 times that of diamond. This allows gemologists to differentiate the two substances by weight alone. This property can also be exploited, for example, by dropping the stones in a heavy liquid and comparing their relative rates of descent: diamond will sink more slowly than CZ.
*Refractive index: cubic zirconia has a refractive index of 2.15–2.18, compared to a diamond&#x27;s 2.42. This has led to the development of other immersion techniques for identification. In these methods, stones with refractive indices higher than that of the liquid used will have dark borders around the girdle and light facet edges whereas those with indices lower than the liquid will have light borders around the girdle and dark facet junctions.
*Dispersion is very high at 0.058–0.066, exceeding a diamond&#x27;s 0.044.
*Cut: Cubic zirconia gemstones can be cut differently than diamonds: The facet edges can be rounded or &quot;smooth&quot;.
*Color: only the rarest of diamonds are truly colorless, most having a tinge of yellow or brown to some extent. A cubic zirconia is often entirely colorless: equivalent to a perfect &quot;D&quot; on diamond&#x27;s color grading scale. That said, desirable colors of cubic zirconia can be produced including near colorless, yellow, pink, purple, green, and even multicolored.
* Thermal conductivity: Cubic zirconia is a thermal insulator whereas diamond is the most powerful thermal conductor. This provides the basis for Wenckus’ canonical identification method, the industry standard.

=== Effects on the diamond market ===
Cubic zirconia, as a diamond simulant and jewel competitor, can potentially reduce demand for conflict diamonds, and impact the controversy surrounding the rarity and value of diamonds.

Regarding value, the paradigm that diamonds are costly due to their rarity and visual beauty has been replaced by an artificial rarity attributed to price-fixing practices of De Beers Company which held a monopoly on the market from the 1870s to early 2000s. The company pleaded guilty to these charges in an Ohio court in 13 July 2004. However, while De Beers has less market power, the price of diamonds continues to increase due to the demand in emerging markets such as India and China. The emergence of artificial stones such as cubic zirconia with optic properties similar to diamonds, could be an alternative for jewelry buyers given their lower price and noncontroversial history.

An issue closely related to monopoly is the emergence of conflict diamonds. The Kimberley Process (KP) was established to deter the illicit trade of diamonds that fund civil wars in Angola and Sierra Leone. However, the KP is not as effective in decreasing the number of conflict diamonds reaching the European and American markets. Its definition does not include forced labor conditions or human right violations. A 2015 study from the Enough Project, showed that groups in the Central African Republic have reaped between US$3 million and US$6 million annually from conflict diamonds. UN reports show that more than US$24 million in conflict diamonds have been smuggled since the establishment of the KP. Diamond simulants have become an alternative to boycott the funding of unethical practices. Terms such as “Eco-friendly Jewelry” define them as conflict free origin and environmentally sustainable. However, concerns from mining countries such as the Democratic Republic of Congo are that a boycott in purchases of diamonds would only worsen their economy. According to the Ministry of Mines in Congo, 10% of its population relies on the income from diamonds. Therefore, cubic zirconia are a short term alternative to reduce conflict but a long term solution would be to establish a more rigorous system of identifying the origin of these stones.

<text>Władysław I Herman ( 1044 – 4 June 1102) was the duke of Poland from 1079 until his death.

==Accession==
Władysław was the second son of the Polish duke Casimir the Restorer and Maria Dobroniega of Kiev. As the second son, Władysław was not destined for the throne. However, due to the flight from Poland of his older brother Bolesław the Bold in 1079, he became duke of Poland. Opinions vary on whether Władysław played an active role in the plot to depose his brother or whether he was handed the authority simply because he was the best candidate to replace Bolesław.

==German relations==

In 1080, in order to improve the relations between Poland and Bohemia, Władysław married Judith, the daughter of Duke Vratislaus II of Bohemia, a vassal of the Holy Roman Empire. After this, Władysław&#x27;s foreign policy gravitated strongly towards appeasing the Holy Roman Empire, and he accepted the overlordship of Emperor Henry IV. While Vratislaus was declared a king in 1085 by Emperor Henry, Władysław never pursued kingship. Soon after, he was forced by the barons of Poland to recall his nephew Mieszko Bolesławowic from exile in Hungary. Mieszko accepted the overlordship of his uncle and gave up his claim to Poland in exchange for becoming first in the line of succession. Władysław was forced to accept the terms of his nephew, because his eldest and only son at that time, Zbigniew, was born from a union not recognized by the church. Władysław&#x27;s relations with Henry considerably improved after Judith of Bohemia died and Władysław married Henry&#x27;s sister Judith, dowager queen of Hungary, in 1089.

Władysław abandoned the alliance with Hungary favored by his deposed brother, and joined the anti-papal camp. He also resumed paying tribute for Silesia to Bohemia. In addition, Kraków and Cieszyn were ceded to Bohemia, and Lubusz Land was lost to Germany, while Przemyśl Land in the east was lost to Halych-Ruthenia. Władysław did make attempts to regain control of Pomerania, and through numerous expeditions was temporarily (1090–1091) able to do so.

==Domestic difficulties==
Although Władysław was formally duke of Poland, in reality the barons who banished his brother used this victory to strengthen their position. It is not surprising, therefore, that within a short time Władysław was forced to give up the government to his count palatine (Polish: wojewoda), a nobleman named Sieciech. Sieciech&#x27;s administration of the realm was negatively perceived by those of the barons who were not the beneficiaries of the power shift.

The birth of Bolesław Wrymouth to Władysław and Judith of Bohemia changed the political situation in Poland. Władysław&#x27;s nephew Mieszko was already seventeen at that time and was, by the previous agreement made after his return, the first in line to succeed. In 1089 Mieszko died under mysterious circumstances, probably poisoned on the orders of Sieciech and Judith of Swabia. Almost immediately, Zbigniew was sent to Germany and placed in the Quedlinburg Abbey. With the idea of forcing his first-born son to take holy vows, Władysław intended to deprive him of any chance of succession.

In 1090 Sieciech, with help of Polish forces under his command, managed to gain control of Gdańsk Pomerania, albeit for a short time. Major towns were garrisoned by Polish troops, the rest were burned, in order to thwart any future resistance. Several months later, however, a rebellion of native elites led to the restoration of the region&#x27;s independence from Poland. Sieciech&#x27;s tyrannical rule reflected negatively on Władysław, causing a massive political migration out of Poland. In 1093 Silesia rebelled, and the &quot;comes&quot; Magnus, with the assistance of the Bohemian and Polish knights, welcomed Zbigniew after he escaped from Germany; however, soon Sieciech captured the prince and imprisoned him. The increasing dissatisfaction in the country forced the release of Zbigniew in 1097. Immediately after this Władysław (after an unsuccessful retaliatory expedition against Silesia and being forced to recognize Zbigniew as the legitimate heir) appointed his sons as commanders of the army which was formed in order to recapture Gdańsk Pomerania.

Simultaneously a great migration of Jews from Western Europe to Poland began circa 1096, around the time of the First Crusade. Władysław, a tolerant ruler, attracted the Jews to his domains, and permitted them to settle throughout the entire country without restriction.

Soon Zbigniew and Bolesław decided to join forces and demanded that the reins of government should be handed over to them. Władysław agreed to divide the realm between the brothers, each to be granted his own province while he himself kept control of Mazovia and its capital at Płock. Władysław also retained control of the most important cities--&quot;i.e.&quot;, Wrocław, Kraków and Sandomierz. Zbigniew&#x27;s province encompassed Greater Poland including Gniezno, Kuyavia, Łęczyca and Sieradz. Bolesław&#x27;s territory included Lesser Poland, Silesia and Lubusz Land. However, Sieciech, alarmed by the evident diminution of his power, began to intrigue against the brothers. Władysław decided to support him against his own sons. Defeated, and after the mediation of Martin, Archbishop of Gniezno, the Duke was forced to confiscate Sieciech&#x27;s properties and exiled him in 1101.

==Erection of churches==

Władysław founded several churches in Poland. Most notably he was the founder of the Romanesque Wawel Cathedral of which the Silver Bells Tower still remains standing. He was also very fond of Saint Giles (Polish: Idzi) to whom he founded no less than three churches: in Kraków, Inowłódz and Giebułtów. This is attributed to the fact that while his first wife was finally pregnant after six years of childless marriage, the Duke sent rich gifts to the Benedictine monastery of Saint Gilles in southern France, begging for a healthy child. When a son was born, Wladyslaw began building churches in his honor. According to legend, he also founded a church &quot;on the sand&quot; dedicated to the Virgin Mary, which was later granted to the Carmelites.

==Health==

According to Gallus Anonymus, Władysław long suffered from a debilitating ailment that affected his legs. There is also a legend which states that in 1086 Władysław was affected by a terrible pox, with abscesses that affected his nose and face. According to the legend, the Holy Virgin appeared in the duke&#x27;s dream and led him to find the cure in the sandy area outside the city. Once healed Władysław founded a Church of the Holiest Virgin Mary &quot;on the sand&quot; in the spot where he found the cure.

Władysław died on 4 June 1102, without resolving the issue of succession, leaving his sons to struggle for supremacy. His body was interred in the Płock Cathedral.

==Marriages and issue==

Before Władysław became duke of Poland, probably during the 1070s, he had a relationship with a woman named Przecława, whose exact origins are unknown, although some sources stated that she belonged to the Prawdzic clan. Her status is also a matter of dispute among the historians: some believed that she was only Władysław&#x27;s mistress and others asserted that she was his wife, but this union was performed under pagan rituals and in consequence not recognized by the Church as a valid marriage. By 1080, one year after Władysław ascended to the Polish throne, Przecława either died or was sent away; it is believed by some sources that after she was dismissed by Władysław, Przecława took the veil under the name Christina () and died around 1092. This union produced a son, Zbigniew (b. c. 1070/73 – d. c. 1112/14), who was considered illegitimate.

In 1080, Władysław married Judith ( 1056 – 1086), daughter of Vratislaus II of Bohemia. They had a son, Bolesław Wrymouth (1086 – 1138). In 1089 Władysław married Judith (1054 – 1105), daughter of Emperor Henry III and widow of King Solomon of Hungary. Their daughters were:
#Sophia (b. c. 1089 – d. bef. 12 May 1112), married before 1108 to Iaroslav Sviatopolkovich, Prince of Volhynia, son of Sviatopolk II of Kiev.
#Agnes (b. c. 1090 – d. 29 December 1127), abbess of Quedlinburg (1110) and Gandersheim (1111).
#Adelaide (b. c. 1091 – d. 25/26 March 1127), married before 1118 to Margrave Diepold III of Vohburg
#A daughter (b. c. 1092 – d. bef. 1111), married c. 1111 to a Polish lord.

<text>Bolesław III Wrymouth (; 20 August 1086 – 28 October 1138), also known as Boleslaus the Wry-mouthed, was the duke of Lesser Poland, Silesia and Sandomierz between 1102 and 1107 and over the whole of Poland between 1107 and 1138. He was the only child of Duke Władysław I Herman and his first wife, Judith of Bohemia.

Bolesław began to rule in the last decade of the 11th century, when the central government in Poland was significantly weakened. Władysław I Herman fell under the political dependence of the Count palatine Sieciech, who became the &quot;de facto&quot; ruler of the country. Backed by their father, Boleslaw and his half-brother Zbigniew finally expelled Sieciech from the country in 1101, after several years of fighting. After the death of Władysław I Herman in 1102, two independent states were created, ruled by Bolesław and Zbigniew.

Bolesław sought to gain Pomerania which caused an armed conflict between the brothers, and forced Zbigniew to flee the country and seek military help from King Henry V of Germany. Bolesław punished Zbigniew by blinding him. This action caused outrage among supporters of Zbigniew, resulting in a political crisis in Poland. Bolesław once again gained the favor of his subjects with public penance, and made a pilgrimage to the monastery of his patron, Saint Giles, in Hungary.

Bolesław, like Bolesław II the Generous, based his foreign policy on maintaining good relations with neighboring Hungary and Kievan Rus, with whom he forged strong links through marriage and military cooperation in order to break Poland&#x27;s political dependence on Germany and Henry&#x27;s vassal, the King of Bohemia, who in moments of weakness of Polish policy was forced to pay tribute in Silesia. These alliances had allowed Bolesław to effectively defend the country from invasion in 1109. Several years later, Bolesław skillfully took advantage of the dynastic disputes in Bohemia to ensure peace on the south-west border.

Bolesław devoted the second half of his rule to the conquest of Pomerania. In 1113 he conquered the northern cities along Noteć, which strengthened the border with the Pomeranians. In subsequent years, he took further steps toward the conquest of Pomerania. The resolution of the conflict with the Holy Roman Empire allowed Bolesław to subordinate Western Pomerania and incorporate Gdańsk Pomerania. The expeditions, carried out in three stages, ended in the 1120s with military and political successes. Integration of the newly annexed lands enabled Bolesław to build churches and begin the process of converting Pomerania. Bishop Otto of Bamberg confirmed the Christianization of Pomerania from 1123 onward.

In the 1130s Bolesław participated in the dynastic dispute in Hungary. After an unexpected defeat, he was forced to make an agreement with Germany. The Congress of Merseburg of 1135 addressed the issues of Pomerania, Silesian (probably also Polish) sovereignty and the supremacy of the Archbishopric of Magdeburg over the Polish Church.

Bolesław was married twice. His first marriage, to the Kievan princess Zbyslava, gave him an excuse to intervene militarily in the internal affairs of Rus&#x27;. After her death, Bolesław married a German noblewoman, Salomea of Berg, which in some way was the cause of changes in Polish foreign policy: in the second half of his rule, the duke sought to restore diplomatic relations with his western neighbor. His last, and perhaps most momentous act, was his will and testament known as &quot;The Succession Statute&quot; in which he divided the country among his sons, leading to almost 200 years of feudal fragmentation of the Polish Kingdom.

Bolesław III Wrymouth has been recognized by historiography as a symbol of Polish political aspirations until well into the 19th century. He also upheld the independence of the Polish archbishopric of Gniezno, despite a temporary failure in the 1130s. Although he achieved undoubted successes, he committed serious political errors, most notably against Zbigniew of Poland, his half-brother. The crime against Zbigniew and his penance for it show Bolesław&#x27;s great ambition as well as his ability to find political compromise.

==Childhood==
===Situation of Poland during the 1080s===
In 1086 the coronation of Vratislav II as King of Bohemia, and his alignment with László I, King of Hungary, threatened the position of the Polish ruler, duke Władysław I Herman. Therefore, that same year Władysław I was forced to recall from Hungarian banishment the only son of Bolesław II the Bold and a rightful heir to the Polish throne, Mieszko Bolesławowic. Upon his return young Bolesławowic accepted the over-lordship of his uncle and gave up his hereditary claim to the crown of Poland in exchange for becoming first in line to succeed him. In return, Władysław I Herman granted his nephew the district of Kraków. The situation was further complicated for Władysław I Herman by a lack of a legitimate male heir, as his first-born son Zbigniew came from a union not recognized by the church. With the return of Mieszko Bolesławowic to Poland, Władysław I normalized his relations with the kingdom of Hungary as well as Kievan Rus (the marriage of Mieszko Bolesławowic to a Kievan princess was arranged in 1088). These actions allowed Herman to strengthen his authority and alleviate further tensions in international affairs.

===Birth and naming===
The lack of a legitimate heir, however, remained a concern for Władysław I and in 1085 he and his wife Judith of Bohemia sent rich gifts, among which was a life size statue of a child made of gold, to the Benedictine Sanctuary of Saint Giles in Saint-Gilles, Provence begging for offspring. The Polish envoys were led by the personal chaplain of Duchess Judith, Piotr.

The date of birth of Bolesław is closely linked with the death of his mother Judith. This fact is evidenced by contemporary sources:

* Gallus Anonymus in the &quot;Cronicae et gesta ducum sive principum Polonorum&quot; reported that Duchess Judith gave birth to Bolesław on the day of Saint Stephen, King of Hungary (whose feast since the 11th century was celebrated on 20 August). However, the Duchess&#x27;s health never recovered from childbirth and she died on &quot;the night of Nativity&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot;, 24–25 December). Gallus did not note the year in his chronicle.
* Cosmas of Prague wrote in Latin in his &quot;Chronica Boëmorum&quot; (&quot;Chronicle of Bohemians&quot;) that Bolesław was born three days before the death of Judith, who died in VIII Calends of January (25 December) of 1085.
* The &quot;Kalendarz krakowski&quot; said that Duchess Judith died on 24 December 1086, and only indicated that the birth of Bolesław was in the same year.
* The Obituary of the Abbey of Saint-Gilles reported the death of Judith on 24 December 1086.
* The &quot;Rocznik kapituły krakowskiej&quot; (closely related to the &quot;Kalendarz krakowski&quot;) placed the death of Judith on 24 December 1086.

Historian August Bielowski established Bolesław&#x27;s birth on 26 December 1085 and the death of his mother two days later, on 28 December. According to him Gallus Anonymus committed two errors. First, instead of &quot;the Sunday after the Nativity of the Lord&quot;, he wrote incorrectly &quot;in the Sunday of the Nativity&quot;. Secondly, he mistook the day of Saint Stephen (26 December) for the festivities of King Stephen of Hungary (20 August). Both corrections lead to the birth date of Bolesław on 26 December. This theory was supported by the fact that, in 1085, 28 December fell on a Sunday.

Oswald Balzer refuted Bielowski&#x27;s theory, arguing that Judith&#x27;s death was on the night of 24/25 December 1086, and the birth of Bolesław was four months before, on 20 August. According to him, this timing of Judith&#x27;s death gives rise to possible discrepancies in determining the exact date of Bolesław&#x27;s birth, but corroborates all known sources who placed the death of Judith. Gallus wrote that Judith died shortly after giving birth to a son. Later sources interpret this as a death in childbirth and Cosmas of Prague followed this fact, though he didn&#x27;t receive the information firsthand. Hence, his mistake would result in this point. In contrast, the correct date of birth of Bolesław would be 20 August, as indicated by Gallus. In the medieval tradition the year began on 25 December. In that case, the reports of Cosmas allow us to conclude that Bolesław was born in 1085. This information, however, was contradicted by the &quot;Kalendarz krakowski&quot;, which gave the year as 1086. Judith was styled by the authors of the &quot;Kalendarz&quot; as &quot;regina Polonia&quot; (&quot;Queen of Poland&quot; in Latin), and this title could be associated with her father&#x27;s coronation as King of Bohemia and Poland on 15 June 1086 (according to Cosmas). Karol Maleczyński refuted Balzer&#x27;s date for the coronation of Vratislav II, the one given by Cosmas. However, most researchers indicate that the coronation took place on 15 June 1085, so Judith could have been called Queen a year earlier.

Karol Maleczyński determined that the death of Judith took place on the night between 24 and 25 December 1085, and Bolesław was born four months before, on 20 August. Researchers found that the date given by the &quot;Rocznik kapituły krakowskiej&quot; (24 December 1086) was the same established by Cosmas (25 December 1085). The difference in the year could be explained in the different style of dating followed by Cosmas, who began the year according to the Julian calendar on 1 January and Christmas (&quot;Nativitate&quot; in Latin) on 25 December. According to Maleczyński, Kazimierz Jasiński failed to consider this calendar difference, which occurs only during the period of 25–31 December.

Archaeologist Wojciech Szafrański reassumed the theory of Bielowski: Judith of Bohemia died on 28 December 1085, and Bolesław was born two days before, on 26 December. According to Szafrański Cosmas used the term &quot;VIII Calends of January&quot;, with no specific date. However, in the Chronicle of Gallus should read that Judith died &quot;on Christmas Day&quot;, but &quot;on Sunday in the Octave of Christmas&quot;. Using such a broadened range of days, the investigator determined the birth of Boleslaw in the feast of Saint Stephen (26 December). For this reasons, the date of 1085 given by Bielowski is correct according to him. However, Jasiński pointed the weaknesses of the argument of Szafrański because Gallus has written about the Octave, but specifically about Christmas night, but the investigator didn&#x27;t consider all other sources, as well as the achievements of research in genealogy.

Marian Plezia argued that Bolesław was born on 2 September 1085 or 1086. According to Gallus, the day of King Stephen of Hungary was also celebrated on 2 September. Jasiński considered this theory unfounded. In Poland the feast of King Stephen of Hungary is pointed by the &quot;Kalendarz krakowski&quot; and the &quot;kalendarz Kodeksu Gertrudy&quot; on 20 August. Besides, if Bolesław was born on 2 September, Gallus probably would be noted that this was the day after the celebration of Saint Giles (1 September), which was attributed to be the intercessor of his birth.

Kazimierz Jasiński placed the death of Judith in the night between 24 and 25 December 1086 and the birth of Bolesław four months before, on 20 August. In this point he agrees with the findings of Balzer. He supported his views with additional arguments: All sources are based in the missing &quot;Rocznika kapituły krakowskiej&quot;, and the next known text of this source refers to events in 1086. Cosmas, writing his chronicle a few decades later, probably benefited from oral tradition and could make a mistake when he placed the year. His reports who placed the birth of Bolesław three days before the death of his mother denoted a quite short time.

Today is widely recognized the view of both Jasiński and Balzer, that Bolesław most likely was born in the day of King Stephen of Hungary, 20 August 1086.
According to Cosmas of Prague, Bolesław was named after his uncle, Bolesław II the Generous. Władysław I Herman had no reason to named his first-born legitimate son after his brother, but probably in this way tried to placate the former allies of his predecessor.

Bolesław&#x27;s nickname &quot;Wrymouth&quot; (pl: &quot;Krzywousty&quot;) appeared in Polish and Latin sources of the 13th century: &quot;Genealogia płocka (Criwousti)&quot; and the &quot;Rocznik świętokrzyski młodszy (Crzyvousti)&quot;. Probably the origin of this nickname dates back on the 12th century and is related with some physical characteristics of the Polish ruler, who were noticed at the time of his reign. Probably he began to be named in this way after 1114, because Gallus Anonymus in his &quot;Chronicle&quot; never mentioned it. In the &quot;Kronika książąt polskich&quot; and &quot;Kronika polsko-śląska&quot; Bolesław was qualified by the Latin adjective &quot;curvus&quot;, whose significance remains unclear. According to the 14th-century &quot;Kronika o Piotrze Włostowicu&quot; the duke was hunchbacked (Latin: &quot;gibbosus&quot;) or had a crooked mouth. The 15th-century chronicler Jan Długosz wrote:

:: He had a mouth on one side slightly bent, and for this he was called Wrymouth; however, this is not marred his face, and even added to him some charm.

In March 1972, in the Masovian Blessed Virgin Mary Cathedral of Płock, where according to tradition Bolesław was buried, an archaeological research project was conducted. A coffin was discovered containing the bones of 16 men and women. One of the skulls, of a man who died aged 50, had a deformed mandible. There is a hypothesis that these remains belonged to Bolesław. Opponents of this theory suggest that the duke was named in this way many years after his death, and his contemporary Gallus did not mention any physical defect in the hero of his Chronicles. The defenders of the hypothesis argue that the work of Gallus has the characteristics of a panegyric in honor of Bolesław, because the chronicler did not mention his physical infirmities. It is also speculated that the bone damage occurred as a result of childbirth complications, which led to the death of his mother a few months later.

The nickname of Boleslaw was also explained in other ways. According to a legend, Boleslaw slammed his face against a wall after watching his father&#x27;s subservience towards the Germans and Czechs. According to Jan Długosz, the duke in his youth had an ulcer, which caused the deformity of his face. According to older historiography, he received the nickname Wrymouth for his perjury.

===Early years===
Following Bolesław&#x27;s birth the political climate in the country changed. The position of Bolesław as an heir to the throne was threatened by the presence of Mieszko Bolesławowic, who was already seventeen at the time and was furthermore, by agreement with Władysław I Herman himself, the first in line to succeed. In all likelihood it was this situation that precipitated the young duke Mieszko&#x27;s demise in 1089. In that same year Wladyslaw I Herman&#x27;s first-born son Zbigniew was sent to a monastery in Quedlinburg, Saxony. This suggests that Wladyslaw I Herman intended to be rid of Zbigniew by making him a monk, and therefore depriving him of any chance of succession. This eliminated two pretenders to the Polish throne, secured young Bolesław&#x27;s inheritance as well as diminished the growing opposition to Wladyslaw I Herman among the nobility. Shortly after his ascension, however, Władysław I Herman was forced by the barons to give up the &quot;de facto&quot; reins of government to Count Palatine Sieciech. This turn of events was likely due to the fact that Herman owed the throne to the barons, the most powerful of whom was Sieciech.

Around this time Władysław I Herman married again. The chosen bride was Judith-Maria, daughter of Emperor Henry III and widow of King Solomon of Hungary, who after her wedding took the name &quot;Sophia&quot; in order to distinguish herself from Władysław I Herman&#x27;s first wife. Through this marriage Bolesław gained three or four half-sisters, and as a consequence he remained the only legitimate son and heir. It is believed that the new Duchess was actively aiding Sieciech in his schemes to take over the country and that she became his mistress.

===Position of Sieciech in Poland===
In 1090 Polish forces under Sieciech&#x27;s command managed to gain control of Gdańsk Pomerania, albeit for a short time. Major towns were garrisoned by Polish troops, and the rest were burned in order to thwart future resistance. Several months later, however, a rebellion of native elites led to the restoration of the region&#x27;s independence from Poland. The following year a punitive expedition was organized, in order to recover Gdańsk Pomerania. The campaign was decided at the battle of the Wda River, where the Polish knights suffered a defeat despite the assistance of Bohemian troops.

Duke Bolesław&#x27;s childhood happened at a time when a massive emigration from Poland was taking place due to Sieciech&#x27;s political repression. Most of the elites who became political refugees found safe haven in Bohemia. Another consequence of Sieciech&#x27;s political persecution was the kidnapping of Zbigniew by Sieciech&#x27;s enemies and his return from abroad in 1093. Zbigniew took refuge in Silesia, a stronghold of negative sentiment for both Sieciech and his nominal patron Władysław I Herman. In the absence of Sieciech and Bolesław, who were captured by Hungarians, duke Władysław I then undertook a penal expedition to Silesia, which was unsuccessful and subsequently obliged him to recognize Zbigniew as a legitimate heir. In 1093 Władysław I signed an Act of Legitimization which granted Zbigniew the rights of descent from his line. Zbigniew was also granted the right to succeed to the throne. Following Sieciech and Bolesław&#x27;s escape from Hungary, an expedition against Zbigniew was mounted by the Count Palatine. Its aim was to nullify the Act of Legitimization. The contestants met at the battle of Gopło in 1096, where Sieciech&#x27;s forces annihilated the supporters of Zbigniew. Zbigniew himself was taken prisoner, but regained his freedom a year later, in May 1097, due to the intervention of the bishops. At the same time his rights, guaranteed by the Act of Legitimization, were reinstated.

Simultaneously a great migration of Jews from Western Europe to Poland began circa 1096, around the time of the First Crusade. The tolerant rule of Władysław I Herman attracted the Jews who were permitted to settle throughout the entire kingdom without restrictions. The Polish duke took great care of the Hebrew Diaspora, as he understood its positive influence on the growth of the country&#x27;s economy. The new Jewish citizens soon gained the trust of the gentiles during the rule of Bolesław III.

==Youth==

===Division of the country===
In view of his father&#x27;s disapproval, and after discovering the plans of Sieciech and Duchess Judith-Sophia to take over the country Zbigniew gained an ally in the young duke Bolesław. Both brothers demanded that the reins of government be handed over to them. It is difficult to believe, however, that Bolesław was making independent decisions at this point as he was only 12 years of age. It is postulated that at this stage he was merely a pawn in service of the Baron&#x27;s power struggle. Władysław I Herman, however, agreed to divide the realm between the brothers, each to be granted his own province while the duke – Władysław I himself – kept control of Mazovia and its capital at Płock. Władysław also retained control of the most important cities, &quot;i.e.&quot;, Wrocław, Kraków and Sandomierz. Zbigniew&#x27;s province encompassed Greater Poland including Gniezno, Kuyavia, Łęczyca Land and Sieradz Land. Bolesław&#x27;s territory included Lesser Poland, Silesia and Lubusz Land.

The division of the country under Bolesław and Zbigniew&#x27;s co-rule greatly alarmed Sieciech, who then began preparing to dispose of the brothers altogether. Sieciech understood that the division of the country would undermine his position. He initiated a military settlement of the issue and he gained the duke&#x27;s support for it. The position of Władysław I is seen as ambiguous as he chose to support Sieciech&#x27;s cause instead of his sons&#x27;.

===Fight against Sieciech===
In response to Sieciech&#x27;s preparations Bolesław and Zbigniew entered into an alliance at a popular assembly or Wiec organized in Wrocław by a magnate named Skarbimir of the Awdaniec family. There it was decided to remove the current guardian of Bolesław, a noble named Wojslaw who was a relative of Sieciech, and arrange for an expedition against the Palatine. Subsequently, in 1099, the armies of Sieciech and duke Herman encountered the forces of Zbigniew and Bolesław near Żarnowiec by the river Pilica. There the forces of Bolesław and Zbigniew defeated Sieciech&#x27;s army, and Władysław I Herman was obliged to permanently remove Sieciech from the position of Count Palatine. In the same year, at Christmas, Bolesław concluded a short-lived peace with Bohemia in Žatec. According to Cosmas, Bolesław was appointed Miecznik (en: &quot;Sword-bearer&quot;) of his uncle Bretislaus II, Duke of Bohemia. In addition, the young duke would be paid the amount of 100 pieces of fine silver and 10 talents of gold annually as a tribute to Bohemia (it was about the land of Silesia, for which he paid tribute to Władysław I).

The rebel forces then headed to Sieciechów, where the Palatine took refuge. Unexpectedly, duke Władysław came to the aid of his besieged favorite with a small force. At this point, the dukes decided to depose their father. The opposition sent Zbigniew with an armed contingent to Masovia, where he was to take control of Płock, while Bolesław was directed to the South to encircle Władysław&#x27;s forces. Władysław, however, predicted this maneuver and sent his forces back to Masovia. In the environs of Płock the battle was finally joined and the forces of Władysław I were defeated. The duke was thereafter forced to send Sieciech into exile. The Palatine left Poland around 1100/1101 and spent time in German territory. He eventually returned to Poland but never played a political role again. He may have been blinded.

==First years of government==

===Struggle for supremacy (1102–06)===

Władysław I Herman died on 4 June 1102. The country was divided into two provinces, each administered by one of the late duke&#x27;s sons. The extent of each province closely resembled the provinces that the dukes were granted by their father three years earlier, the only difference being that Zbigniew also controlled Mazovia with its capital at Płock, effectively ruling the northern part of the kingdom, while his younger half-brother Bolesław ruled its southern portion. In this way two virtually separate states were created. According to some historians, Zbigniew tried to play the role of &quot;princeps&quot; or overlord, because at that time Bolesław was only 16 years old. Because he was still too inexperienced to independently direct his domains, the local nobility had great influence over political affairs, including his teacher, Skarbimir, from the Awdaniec family.

They conducted separate policies internally as well as externally. They each sought alliances, and sometimes they were enemies of one another. Such was the case with Pomerania, towards which Bolesław aimed his ambitions. Zbigniew, whose country bordered Pomerania, wished to maintain good relations with his northern neighbor. Bolesław, eager to expand his dominion, organized several raids into Pomerania and Prussia. In Autumn of 1102 Bolesław organized a war party into Pomerania during which his forces sacked Białogard.

The Pomeranians sent retaliatory war parties into Polish territory, but as Pomerania bordered Zbigniew&#x27;s territory these raids ravaged the lands of the duke who was not at fault. Therefore, in order to put pressure on Bolesław, Zbigniew allied himself with Bořivoj II of Bohemia, to whom he promised to pay tribute in return for his help. By aligning himself with Bolesław&#x27;s southern neighbor Zbigniew wished to compel Bolesław to cease his raids into Pomerania. Bolesław, on the other hand, allied himself with Kievan Rus and Hungary. His marriage to Zbyslava, the daughter of Sviatopolk II Iziaslavich in 1103, was to seal the alliance between himself and the prince of Kiev. However, Bolesław&#x27;s first diplomatic move was to recognize Pope Paschal II, which put him in strong opposition to the Holy Roman Empire. A later visit of papal legate Gwalo, Bishop of Beauvais, put church matters into order and increased Bolesław&#x27;s influence.

Zbigniew declined to attend the marriage of Bolesław and Zbyslava. He saw this union and the alliance with Kiev as a serious threat. He bribed his ally, Bořivoj II of Bohemia, to invade Bolesław&#x27;s province, ostensibly to claim the Polish crown. Bolesław retaliated with expeditions into Pomerania in 1103 (including the battle of Kołobrzeg, where he was defeated) and Moravia in 1104–05, which brought the young duke not only loot, but also effectively ended the Pomeranian alliance. During the return of the army, one part, commanded by Żelisław, was defeated by the Bohemians. Bolesław, who commanded the other part, couldn&#x27;t defeat them. Skarbimir bribed Bořivoj II, who returned to his homeland and concluded a short-lived peace with Bolesław. Then Bořivoj II ended his alliance with Zbigniew.

The intervention of Bolesław in a dynastic dispute in Hungary put him in a difficult political situation. At first, he supported the pretender Álmos, and marched to Hungary to help him. However, during the siege of Abaújvár in 1104, Álmos changed his mind and made peace overtures to his brother and rival King Coloman, at that point Zbigniew&#x27;s ally. Bolesław then retired his troops from Hungary and in 1105 made a treaty with Coloman. In addition, the Hungarian King broke his agreements with Bohemia. The dynastic dispute in Prague between Bořivoj II and his cousin Svatopluk prompted Bolesław and his new ally King Coloman to intervene in support of Svatopluk. However, a new rebellion by Álmos forced Coloman and his army to return to Hungary. Bolesław also decided to retreat. Svatopluk tried to capture the city alone, but suffered a complete defeat and so his attempt to seize power in Bohemia was unsuccessful.

Also in 1105, Bolesław entered into an agreement with his half-brother, similar to that entered just a few years before with their stepmother Judith-Sophia, which, in exchange for abundant dower lands, secured her neutrality in Bolesław&#x27;s political contest with Zbigniew. The treaty, signed in Tyniec, dealt with foreign policy, albeit with no agreement about Pomerania. One year later, the treaty ended when Zbigniew refused to help his half-brother in his fight against Pomerania. While hunting, Bolesław was unexpectedly attacked by them. In the battle, the young duke almost died. Bohemia, using the involvement of Bolesław in Pomeranian affairs as an excuse, attacked Silesia. The duke tried to re-establish the alliance with his half-brother, but without success, and so reached a rapprochement with Bohemia in 1106. Bolesław managed to bribe Bořivoj II to join his side in the contest against Zbigniew and shortly after formally allied himself with Coloman of Hungary. With the help of his Kievan and Hungarian allies Bolesław attacked Zbigniew&#x27;s territory, beginning a civil war. The allied forces of Bolesław easily took control of most important cities, including Kalisz, Gniezno, Spycimierz and Łęczyca, in effect taking half of Zbigniew&#x27;s lands. Through the mediation of Baldwin, Bishop of Kraków, a peace treaty was signed at Łęczyca, in which Zbigniew officially recognized Bolesław as the Supreme Duke of all Poland. However, he was allowed to retain Masovia as a fief.

===Sole Ruler of Poland===

====First Expedition to Bohemia and exile of Zbigniew====
In 1107 Bolesław III along with his ally King Coloman of Hungary invaded Bohemia in order to aid Svatopluk in gaining the Czech throne and to secure Polish interests to the south. The expedition was a complete success: on 14 May 1107 Svatopluk was made Duke of Bohemia in Prague.

In the winter of 1107–08, with the help of Kievan and Hungarian allies, Bolesław undertook a punitive expedition against his brother Zbigniew. One reason for this was that Zbigniew had not followed his orders and had refused to burn down one of the fortresses of Kurów near Puławy. Another reason was that Zbigniew had not performed his duties as a vassal by failing to provide military aid to Bolesław for a campaign against the Pomeranians. Bolesław&#x27;s forces attacked Mazovia and quickly forced Zbigniew to surrender. Following this, Zbigniew was banished from the country and, with his followers, took refuge in Prague, where he gained the support of Svatopluk. From then Bolesław was the sole lord of the Polish lands, though in fact his over-lordship began in 1107 when Zbigniew paid him homage as his feudal lord.

In 1108 the balance of power in Europe changed. Svatopluk decided to pay homage to Emperor Henry V and in exchange received from him the formal investiture of Bohemia. At the same time King Coloman of Hungary was under attack from the combined forces of the Holy Roman Empire and Bohemia. Svatopluk, joined by Zbigniew and his followers, also attacked Poland. Bolesław avoided a direct confrontation because he was busy fighting Pomerania. The Polish-Hungarian coalition gave aid and shelter to Bořivoj II. Later that year, Bolesław and Coloman sent a new expedition to Bohemia, prompted by the invasion of Hungary by the German-Bohemian coalition (during which Pozsony Castle was put under siege) and the fact that Svatopluk, who owed Bolesław his throne, didn&#x27;t honor his promise to return Silesian cities seized from Poland (Racibórz, Kamieniec, Koźle among others) by his predecessors. Bolesław then decided to restore Bořivoj II to the Bohemian throne, but was unable to do so owing to the need to divert his forces north to thwart a Pomeranian invasion.

====Polish-German War of 1109====
In response to Bolesław&#x27;s aggressive foreign policy, the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry V, undertook a punitive expedition against Poland in 1109, assisted by Czech warriors provided by Svatopluk of Bohemia. The alleged &quot;casus belli&quot; was to restore Zbigniew to his former position. The Emperor gave Bolesław an ultimatum: he would abandon the expedition only if Bolesław gave Zbigniew half of Poland to rule, formally recognized Henry as overlord and paid 300 pieces of fine silver as a regular tribute. Bolesław rejected Henry&#x27;s demands. During the negotiations between the Empire and Poland, the Polish ruler was in the middle of a war against Pomerania. On the west side of the Oder river, Henry V hurriedly gathered knights for his expedition against Poland. Before the fight ended in Pomerania, the German troops were able to approach Głogów.

The military operations mainly took place in Silesia in southwestern Poland, where Henry V&#x27;s army laid siege to the major cities of Głogów, Wrocław and Bytom Odrzański. In addition to defending the towns, Bolesław conducted a guerrilla war against the Holy Roman Emperor and his allies. He reportedly defeated the expedition at the Battle of Hundsfeld on 24 August 1109, although the existence of this battle is doubted by historians because it was first recorded about a century later.

====Second Expedition to Bohemia====
In 1110 Bolesław undertook an unsuccessful military expedition against Bohemia. His intention was to install yet another pretender on the Czech throne, Soběslav I, who sought refuge in Poland. During the campaign he won a decisive victory against the Czechs at the Battle of Trutina on 8 October 1110; however, following this battle he ordered his forces to withdraw. The reason for this is speculated to be the unpopularity of Soběslav I among Czechs as well as Bolesław&#x27;s unwillingness to further harm his relations with the Holy Roman Empire. In 1111 a truce between Poland and the Empire was signed, stipulating that Soběslav I would be able to return to Bohemia while Zbigniew would be able to return Poland. Bolesław&#x27;s assent was likely under pressure from the many supporters of the exiled duke in 1108, who, according to the reports of Gallus Anonymus, was surrounded by bad advisers (probably including Martin I, Archbishop of Gniezno). Once in Poland, his advisers persuaded Zbigniew to claim sovereignty over his previous domains. The first step was his presence at the Advent ceremonial, surrounded by attendants, with a sword carried before him, an exclusive prerogative of the ruler. As he had recognized Bolesław as his overlord in Łęczyca in 1107, Boleslaw considered this an act of treason, causing a definitive breach in their relationship. Probably for these reasons, Zbigniew was blinded on Bolesław&#x27;s orders in 1112.

====Excommunication====
The blinding of Zbigniew caused a strong negative reaction among Bolesław&#x27;s subjects. Unlike in the east, blinding in medieval Poland was accomplished not by burning the eyes out with a red hot iron rod or knife, but employed a much more brutal technique in which the condemned&#x27;s eyes were pried out using special pliers. The condemned was then made to open his eyes and if he did not do so, his eyelids were also removed.

Contemporary sources don&#x27;t provide clear information on whether Bolesław was excluded from the community of the Church. It is generally believed that Archbishop Martin I of Gniezno (who was a strong supporter of Zbigniew) excommunicated Bolesław for blinding his half-brother. The excommunication exempted all Bolesław&#x27;s subjects from their oaths of obedience. The duke was faced with a real possibility of an uprising of the sort that deposed Bolesław the Bold. Recognizing his precarious situation, Bolesław sought the customary penance that would reconcile him with the high priesthood. According to Gallus Anonymus, Bolesław first fasted for forty days and made gifts to the poor:

:: (...)&quot;He slept in ashes and sackcloth, among the streams of tears and sobs, as he renounced communion and conversation with people.&quot;

It is possible that Bolesław decided to do this to rebuild his weakened authority and gain the favor of Zbigniew&#x27;s supporters. Blinding his half-brother might have been perceived by Polish society as a breach of the principle of solidarity among the members of the ruling dynasty, a key foundation of public order.

According to Gallus, Bolesław also sought and received forgiveness from his half-brother. In the next part of his penance, the duke made a pilgrimage to Hungary to the Abbeys of Saint Giles in Somogyvár and Saint Stephen I in Székesfehérvár. The pilgrimage to the Abbey of Saint Giles also had a political goal; Bolesław strengthened his ties of friendship and alliance with the Arpad dynasty. Following his return to Poland, Bolesław even traveled to Gniezno to pay further penance at the tomb of Saint Adalbert of Prague, where poor people and clergy received numerous costly gifts from the duke . Only after this was the excommunication finally lifted. Following his repentance the Polish duke made a vague commitment to the Church.

No information survives about Zbigniew&#x27;s death. In the obituary of the Benedictine monastery in Lubiń dated 8 July 1113 was reported the death of a monk in Tyniec called &quot;brother Zbigniew&quot;. Historians believed that he could be Bolesław&#x27;s half-brother. The information marked that his burial place was in the Benedictine monastery of Tyniec.

==Conquest and conversion of Pomerania==


The loss of Pomerania during the reign of Casimir I the Restorer weakened the Polish state, and, during the second half of the 11th century, subsequent rulers were not able to recover all the lands that once belonged to Mieszko I and Bolesław I the Brave. Only after defeating Zbigniew and successfully opposing Bohemian claims against Silesia in 1109 was Bolesław III able to expand to the West.

===Strengthening the Polish-Pomeranian borders===
The conquest of Pomerania had been a lifelong pursuit for Bolesław. His political goals were twofold: strengthen the Polish border on the Noteć river line, and subjugate Pomerania. He intended to exercise Polish political overlordship but not actually incorporate Pomerania with the exception of Gdańsk Pomerania and a southern belt north of the River Noteć. By 1113 the northern border had been strengthened, including the fortification of Santok, Wieleń, Nakło, Czarnków, Ujście and Wyszogród. Some sources report that the border began at the mouth of the rivers Warta and Oder in the west, running along the Noteć all the way to the Vistula.

Before Bolesław III began to expand in Gdańsk Pomerania (Pomerelia), he normalized his political relations with Bohemia in 1114 at a great convention on the border of the Nysa Kłodzka river. He was assisted by Bohemian princes of the Premyslid line: namely, Vladislaus I, Otto II the Black and Soběslav I. The pact was sealed by the marriage of Bolesław (a widower since his wife Zbyslava&#x27;s death) with Vladislaus I and Otto II&#x27;s sister-in-law, the German noblewoman Salomea of Berg.

===The conquest of Gdańsk Pomerania===
After normalising his relations with Bohemia, Bolesław conducted a successful expedition against Prussia in 1115. This secured Poland&#x27;s north-east border, which allowed him to invade Gdańsk Pomerania. The conquest of this part of the Pomeranian lands from 1115 to 1119 achieved a long-time aim of previous Polish rulers: the complete incorporation of the territories on the Vistula River, including the castellany of Nakło, into Poland. The northern borders of the Polish duchy were probably established on the line of the rivers Gwda and Uniesta (in later times these rivers were the boundary between Pomerania and the Oder Slavic). It is also possible that the border ran along the Łeba.

The local rulers of the conquered Gdańsk and Słupsk were replaced by Polish nobles. Bolesław also introduced Polish clerical organization, in order to protect his interests in that territory. However, these areas refused to follow the church organization. The incorporation into the Polish Church occurred only during 1125–26 at the time of the visit of the papal legate, Gilles, Cardinal-Bishop of Tusculum.

====Rebellion of Skarbimir====
During Bolesław&#x27;s Pomeranian campaign a rebellion led by Count Palatine Skarbimir from the Awdaniec family began. The rebellion was quelled by the duke in 1117 and the mutinous nobleman was blinded as punishment. The conflict between Bolesław and the Awdaniec family is difficult to explain due to the lack of sources. The cause was probably the growing influence of the family, Skarbimir&#x27;s ambition, and his jealousy of Bolesław and his increased popularity. Other probable factors were the desire to establish Władysław II, Bolesław&#x27;s first-born son, as the sole ruler after his death, or Boleslaw&#x27;s fears of losing his position, as had happened in the conflict with Sieciech. It was also suggested that Skarbimir contacted the Pomeranians and Vladimir II Monomakh, Grand Prince of Kievan Rus&#x27;. Medieval historiography also associated the rebellion with the Law of Succession issued by Boleslaw. The underlying inheritance controversy arose between 1115 and 1116, after the birth of his second son Leszek, first of his second marriage. According to one hypothesis, Skarbimir objected to the adoption of the statute, which changed the traditional Polish succession customs. In the suppression of the rebellion a major role was played by Piotr Włostowic of the Labedz family, who replaced Skarbimir as Count Palatine. On his defeat, Skarbimir received a minor punishment from Bolesław. The rebellion of Skarbimir also underlined the importance of the conquest of Gdańsk Pomerania.

====Intervention of Kievan Rus&#x27;====
The Rurikid ruler Vladimir II Monomakh and his sons are believed to have intervened in Skarbimir&#x27;s rebellion. In 1118 Monomakh incorporated Volhynia into his domains and expelled the ruler, Yaroslav Sviatopolkovich, who sought refuge first in Hungary, then in Poland. In Yaroslav&#x27;s place, Monomakh made his son Roman ruler of Volhynia, and after Roman&#x27;s early death in 1119, replaced him with another son, Andrew, who invaded Polish territory in 1120 with the support of the Kipchaks tribe. A year later, Bolesław, with his brother-in-law, the exiled Yaroslav, organized a retaliatory expedition to Czermno. For several years thereafter Bolesław intervened in the dynastic disputes of the House of Rurik.

During the 1120s the Kievan princes continued their expeditions against Poland. The neutrality of the neighbouring Principality of Peremyshl was attributed to Count Palatine Piotr Włostowic, who in 1122 captured Prince Volodar. A year later Bolesław intervened again in Volhynia, where he wished to restore Yaroslav. The expedition (aided by Bohemian, Hungarian, Peremyshl and Terebovl forces) failed due to the death of Yaroslav and the stubborn resistance of the besieged Volodymyr-Volynskyi, aided by Skarbimir&#x27;s supporters. This failed military expedition led to disturbances in the Polish-Hungarian-Halych alliance.

===Conquest of Western Pomerania===
In 1121 (or 1119) Pomeranian Dukes Wartislaw I and Swietopelk I were defeated by Bolesław&#x27;s army at the battle of Niekładź near Gryfice. Polish troops ravaged Pomerania, destroyed native cities, and forced thousands of Pomeranians to resettle deep into Polish territory. Bolesław&#x27;s further expansion was directed to Szczecin (1121–22). He knew that this city was well defended by both the natural barrier of the Oder river and his well-built fortifications, like Kołobrzeg. The only way to approach the walls was through the frozen waters of a nearby swamp. Taking advantage of the element of surprise, Bolesław launched his assault from precisely that direction, and took control of the city. Much of the population was slaughtered and the survivors were forced to pay homage to the Polish ruler.

Bolesław probably fought battles on the western side of the Oder, as well as near Lake Morzyce (now the German &quot;Müritz&quot;), which were technically outside of Pomerania. At the same time, Lothair, Duke of Saxony (and future Holy Roman Emperor), also moved against this area. According to contemporary sources, a Saxon army approached from above the Elbe River in the direction of modern-day Rostock. They conquered the Warinis, Circipanes, Kessinians and part of the Tollensers tribes. This two-pronged expansion was probably the result of earlier unknown agreements between the rulers. This was the first step for the later Christianization of Pomeranian lands.

In 1122 Bolesław finally conquered Western Pomerania, which became a Polish fief. Duke Wartislaw I was forced to pay homage, as well as an annual tribute of 500 marks of fine silver to the Polish ruler, and was further obliged to give military aid at Bolesław&#x27;s request. In subsequent years the tribute was reduced to 300 marks. This success enabled Bolesław to make further conquests. In 1123 his troops even reached Rügen, but failed to conquer it.

According to modern historiography, Bolesław began to pay tribute to Emperor Henry V, at least from 1135, believed to have been 500 marks of fine silver annually. It is unknown why Bolesław did this, as the sources do not contain any reference to the Polish ruler being tributary to the Holy Roman Empire in the period 1121–35.

===Christianization of Western Pomerania===
In order to strengthen ties with Pomerania, Bolesław organized a mission to Christianize the newly acquired territory. At the same time he wished to subordinate Pomerania to the Gniezno Archbishopric. Unfortunately first attempts made by unknown missionaries did not make the desired progress. Another attempt, officially sponsored by Bolesław and led by Bernard the Spaniard, who traveled to Wolin during 1122–23, ended in another failure. The next two missions were carried out in 1124–25 and 1128 by Bishop Otto of Bamberg (called the Apostle of Pomerania). After appropriate consultation with Bolesław, Bishop Otto set out on the first stage of Christianization of the region in 1124. During the mission Otto stayed first at Bolesław&#x27;s court, where he was provided with appropriate equipment, fire and several clergymen for his trip to Pomerania.

The Bishop was accompanied throughout his mission by the Pomeranian ruler Wartislaw I, who greeted him on the border of his domains, in the environs of the city of Sanok. In Stargard the pagan prince promised Otto his assistance in the Pomeranian cities as well as help during the journey. He also assigned 500 armored knights to act as guards for the bishop&#x27;s protection, and obtain the baptism of the elders tribal leaders. Primary missionary activities were directed to Pyrzyce, then the towns of Kamień, Wolin, Szczecin and once again Wolin. In the first two towns the Christianization went without resistance. In Kamień the task was facilitated by the intercession of Wartislaw I&#x27;s own wife and dignitaries. At Szczecin and Wolin, which were important centers of Slavic paganism, opposition to conversion was particularly strong among the pagan priests and local population. The conversion was finally accepted only after Bolesław lowered the annual tribute imposed on the Pomeranians. Four great pagan temples were torn down and churches were built in their places. Otto&#x27;s mission of 1124 ended with the erection of bishoprics in Lubusz for Western Pomerania and in Kruszwica for Eastern Pomerania (Gdańsk), which was subordinated to the Archbishopric of Gniezno.

In 1127 the first pagan rebellions began to take place. These were due to both the large tribute imposed by Poland as well as a plague that descended on Pomerania, which was blamed on Christianity. The rebellions were largely instigated by the old pagan priests, who had not come to terms with their new circumstances. Wartislaw I confronted these uprisings with some success, but was unable to prevent several insurgent raids into Polish territory. Because of this Bolesław prepared a massive punitive expedition that may have spoiled all the earlier accomplishments of the missionary work by Bishop Otto. Thanks to Otto&#x27;s diplomacy, direct confrontation was avoided and in 1128 he embarked on another mission to Pomerania. Wartislaw I greeted Otto at Demmin with some Polish knights. This time more pressure was applied to the territories west of the Oder River, i.e. Usedom, Wolgast and Gützkow, which weren&#x27;t under Polish suzerainty. The final stage of the mission returned to Szczecin, Wolin and Kamień. The Christianization of Pomerania is considered one of the greatest accomplishments of Bolesław&#x27;s Pomeranian policy.

In 1129 Bolesław concluded with Niels, King of Denmark an alliance directed against Wartislaw I and the attempts of Lothair III, King of Germany to subordinate Western Pomerania. In retaliation for the sack of Płock by Wartislaw I in 1128, Polish-Danish troops took the Western Pomeranian islands of Wolin and Usedom.

At end of the 1120s Bolesław began to implement an ecclesiastical organization of Pomerania. Gdańsk Pomerania was added to the Diocese of Włocławek, known at the time as the Kujavian Diocese. A strip of borderland north of Noteć was split between the Diocese of Gniezno and Diocese of Poznan. The bulk of Pomerania was, however, made an independent Pomeranian bishopric (whose first bishop, Adalbert, was one of the participants in the missionary expedition and former Polish royal chaplain), set up in the territory of the Duchy of Pomerania in 1140, and, after Bolesław died in 1138, the duchy became independent of Poland.

===The project of Archbishop Norbert of Magdeburg===
During the 1130s, Norbert, Archbishop of Magdeburg undertook a project under which Pomerania would be divided between two dioceses subordinated to his archbishopric. At the same time, he revived the old claims of Magdeburg&#x27;s ecclesiastical sovereignty over all Poland. A first Bull was prepared by 1131, but never entered into force. Despite this setback, Norbert continued to attempt to subdue the Polish Church during 1132–33. A call was made in the Curia on behalf of the Polish bishops.

The Polish bishops didn&#x27;t appear before Pope Innocent II, which resulted in the issuing of the Bull &quot;Sacrosancta Romana&quot; in 1133, which confirmed the sovereignty of the Archbishopric of Magdeburg over the Polish Church and the projected Pomeranian dioceses. The formal &quot;privilegium maius&quot; was the culmination of Norbert&#x27;s efforts. Bolesław, trying to save his past efforts in Pomeranian politics, submitted at Merseburg in 1135.

===Conquest of Rügen and alliance with Wartislaw I===
To consolidate his power over Pomerania Bolesław conducted an expedition to the island of Rügen in 1130. For this purpose, he concluded an alliance with the Danish duke Magnus Nilsson (his son-in-law) who provided him with a fleet in exchange for support in his efforts to obtain the Swedish throne. The fleet transported Polish troops to Rügen, but the intended battle on the island never happened, because, at the sight of the Polish-Danish combined forces, the defending Rani recognized Bolesław&#x27;s overlordship.

After the successful invasion of the Danish capital, Roskilde, in 1134, Bolesław formed an alliance with Wartislaw I of Pomerania against King Eric II of Denmark, an ally of Emperor Lothair III. The role of the Polish duke was limited to aiding the House of Griffins, not due while the real interest in Danish affairs. The Danish, after repelling the first attack, led a successful retaliatory expedition and expansion into Pomerania.

==Congress of Merseburg==

===Political Background===
In 1125 Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Germany, died. His successor, Lothair of Supplinburg, was embroiled in disputes over his inheritance, and became involved in papal politics. In 1130 there was a double election to the Apostolic See. Lothair supported Pope Innocent II, hoping in this way to secure his own coronation. Contrary to expectations, Lothair&#x27;s Imperial coronation didn&#x27;t end his disputes against the contenders for the German throne.

In 1130 Bolesław controlled the areas situated on the left bank of the Oder river on the island of Rügen. Germany had designs on these lands, but its internal political situation and its involvement in a civil war in Hungary, made an armed conflict impractical. The death of King Stephen II of Hungary in 1131 had led to war between two claimants to the throne: Béla the Blind (son of Álmos, Duke of Croatia) and Boris (the alleged son of King Coloman). Boris sought the help of the Polish ruler, who hoped for a closer alliance with Hungary and cooperation with the Kievan princes (Boris was a son of a daughter of Vladimir II Monomakh). However, Bolesław overestimated his strength against Béla, who had the support of almost all his country. The Polish army faced the combined forces of Hungary, Bohemia, Austria and Germany in the Battle of the Sajó River (22 July 1132), where the coalition achieved complete victory over the Polish duke, who was forced to retreat.

The success in Hungary was used by the Bohemian ruler Soběslav I, an Imperial vassal, who during 1132–34, repeatedly invaded Silesia. The question of Silesia&#x27;s property was left to Lothair III. Around the same time, the bull &quot;Sacrosancta Romana&quot; of 1133 gave the Archbishopric of Magdeburg sovereign rights over the Pomeranian dioceses instituted by Bolesław.

===Preparations for the Congress===
In February 1134 Soběslav I of Bohemia and dignitaries of King Béla II of Hungary, together with Peter, Bishop of Transylvania, went to Altenburg, where they presented their allegations against the Polish ruler. They again, as they had two years before, requested the intervention of the Holy Roman Empire. Lothair III agreed to arbitrate the various dynastic disputes.

At the same time Béla II and Prince Volodymyrko of Peremyshl undertook a military expedition against Poland. The combined forces occupied Lesser Poland, reaching to Wiślica. Shortly after, Bolesław received a summons to the Imperial court at Magdeburg on 26 June 1135. He sent deputies in his stead in order to play for time. The emperor sent another delegation and requested his personal appearance on 15 August 1135, this time in Merseburg. Bolesław realized that without an agreement with Lothair III he couldn&#x27;t maintain control over the newly conquered lands on the west side of the Oder and the island of Rügen.

Even before the Congress of Merseburg took place, Bolesław persuaded one of ruling dukes of Western Pomerania, Ratibor I, to make an expedition against Denmark, a clear provocation to Emperor Lothair III, as the King of Denmark was a German vassal. A Pomeranian fleet of 650 boats (with 44 knights and 2 horses) attacked the rich Norwegian port city of Kungahälla (now Kungälv in Sweden).

===Provisions of the Congress===
The Congress took place on 15 August 1135. During the ceremony, Emperor Lothair III recognized the rights of the Polish ruler over Pomerania. In return, Bolesław agreed to pay homage for the Pomeranian lands and the Principality of Rügen, with the payment of 6,000 pieces of fine silver from these lands to the Holy Roman Empire; however, he remained fully independent ruler of his main realm, Poland. With Bolesław&#x27;s death in 1138, Polish authority over Pomerania ended, triggering competition of the Holy Roman Empire and Denmark for the area. The conflict with Hungary also ended, with Bolesław recognizing Béla II&#x27;s rule. The agreement was sealed with the betrothal of Bolesław&#x27;s daughter Judith with Béla II&#x27;s Géza (this marriage never took place). In the case of the Bohemian-Polish dispute the Imperial mediation failed. Bolesław argued he must be treated as a sovereign ruler, which wasn&#x27;t the case of Soběslav I, an imperial vassal. Lothair III, unable to come to an agreement with the Polish ruler, proposed to discuss the matter in subsequent negotiations.

The Congress ended with church ceremonies, during which Bolesław carried the imperial sword. This was an honor granted only to sovereign rulers. An indirect goal of Polish diplomacy was the successful invalidation of the Papal Bull of 1133 and the recognition of metropolitan rights of the Archbishopric of Gniezno at the Synod of Pisa in 1135. On 7 July 1136, Pope Innocent II issued the protectionist Bull &quot;Ex commisso nobis a Deo&quot; under which the unquestioned sovereignty of the Archbishopric of Gniezno over the Polish dioceses was confirmed.

==Last years and death==

===Normalization of relations with his neighbors===
After coming under the imperial sphere of influence, Poland normalized its relations with Bohemia at the Congress of Kłodzko on 30 May 1137 (the so-called &quot;Peace of Kłodzko&quot;), but the details of this agreement are unknown. This treaty was confirmed in the town of Niemcza, where Władysław, the eldest son of Bolesław, stood as godfather in the baptism of Wenceslaus, Soběslav I&#x27;s son.

In the last years of his life, Bolesław&#x27;s main concern was to arrange political marriages for his children in order to strengthen his relations with neighboring countries. In 1137 Bolesław reinforced his relations with the Kievan Rus&#x27; with the marriage of his son Bolesław with Princess Viacheslava, daughter of Vsevolod, Prince of Pskov. In the year of his death, he finally normalized his relations with Hungary through the marriage of his son Mieszko with Princess Elizabeth, daughter of King Béla II.

===Death===

Bolesław III Wrymouth died on 28 October 1138, probably in the town of Sochaczew. There are no records about the circumstances of his death, and twelfth-century sources don&#x27;t provide information about his place of burial. It was only in the 15th century that Jan Długosz recorded that the duke&#x27;s tomb was in the Masovian Blessed Virgin Mary Cathedral in Płock. He didn&#x27;t reveal the source of this information, but it was presumably from the lost &quot;Rocznik mazowiecki&quot;. Wawrzyniec Wszerecz, Canon of Płock during the 16th–17th centuries, wrote that Bolesław was in a common coffin at the cathedral, where the remains of his father Władysław I Herman and several other Piast Masovian rulers were also placed. In his testament he divided his lands among his sons into five principalities.

==Family==
===First marriage===
Zbyslava of Kiev (c. 1085/90 – c. 1114), his first wife, was a member of the Rurikid dynasty. She was the daughter of Grand Prince Sviatopolk II of Kiev. The marriage was probably concluded in 1103 in order to obtain future military help from Kiev in the fight against Zbigniew. This union also notoriously limited the attacks of the princes of Galicia and Terebovlia against Poland. Until Zbyslava&#x27;s death, relations between Poland and the Principality of Galicia–Volhynia remained friendly. The children born from this marriage were:
# Władysław II the Exile (1105 – 30 May 1159), the only son of Bolesław and Zbyslava, was Prince of Kraków, Silesia, Sandomierz, eastern Greater Poland, Kuyavia, Western Pomerania and Gdańsk Pomerania (1138–46). Gallus Anonymous wrote that the heir of the Polish throne was born in the winter of 1107–08, but omitted the gender and name of the child. The &quot;Rocznik świętokrzyski&quot; and &quot;Rocznik kapitulny&quot; recorded Władysław&#x27;s birth in 1105. 
# A daughter [Judith?] (c. 1112 – after 1124), married in 1124 to Vsevolod Davidovich, Prince of Murom. Her filiation is doubtful, because Russian chronicles only noted that Vsevolod&#x27;s wife came from Poland; she could be either Bolesław and Zbyslava&#x27;s daughter or a member of the Awdaniec family as daughter of Skarbimir.

Older historiography referred to an unnamed second son born from the marriage of Bolesław and Zbyslava. Gallus Anonymous wrote that this son was born around 1107–08. According to Oswald Balzer, he died shortly after birth. However, Karol Maleczyński believed that he never existed, noting that the sources who provided the year of 1105 as Władysław II&#x27;s date of birth (&quot;Rocznik świętokrzyski&quot; and &quot;Rocznik kapitulny&quot;) were probably mistaken.

===Second marriage===
Salomea of Berg (c. 1093/1101 – 27 July 1144), his second wife, was German, the daughter of Count Henry of Berg-Schelklingen. The marriage took place in January or February 1115. This union was connected with the signing of a peace treaty between Poland and Bohemia. Salomea came from a powerful family, who, having supported the opposition after the death of Emperor Henry V in 1125, lost its political influence at the court of Lothair III.

# Leszek (1115/16 – 26 August before 1131), the eldest son of Bolesław and Salomea. He probably died in infancy.
# Ryksa (1116 – after 25 December 1156), eldest daughter of Bolesław and Salomea, in 1127 she married Danish prince Magnus Nilsson, future King of Västergötland, in order to obtain Danish support in the war against Germany, but in 1134 Denmark sided with Germany regardless. After Magnus&#x27; death in 1134, Ryksa returned to Poland. Later she married Volodar Glebovich, Prince of Minsk and Hrodno; this marriage was concluded in order to cement an alliance against Hungary. Her third marriage was with King Sverker I of Sweden.
# A daughter (before 1117/22 – after 1131), betrothed or married in 1131 to Conrad, Count of Plötzkau and Margrave of Nordmark.
# Casimir, known in historiography as &quot;the Older&quot; (9 August 1122 – 19 October 1131), according to sources (like &quot;Rocznik kapituły krakowskiej&quot;), he died aged 9. Jan Długosz in his chronicle wrote that he was born from the marriage of Bolesław and Adelaide, the Prince&#x27;s supposed second wife.
# Gertruda (1123/24 – 7 May 1160), a nun at Zwiefalten (1139).
# Bolesław IV the Curly (c. 1125 – 5 January 1173), Prince of Masovia and Kuyavia (1138–46), of Kraków, Gniezno and Kalisz (1146–73), of Sandomierz (1166–73), married aged 12 with Viacheslava, daughter of Vsevolod, Prince of Pskov. Jan Długosz reported his birth in 1127 as the second son born from Bolesław and Adelaide.
# Mieszko III the Old (1126/27 – Kalisz, 13 March 1202), Duke of Greater Poland (1138–1202), of Kraków (1173–77, 1190, 1199–1202), of Kalisz (1173–1202), of Upper Gdańsk Pomerania (1173–1202) and Kuyavia (1195–98), around 1136 married to Elizabeth, daughter of King Béla II of Hungary. The marriage was concluded as one of the provisions of the Congress of Merseburg.
# Dobroniega Ludgarda (1129 – by 1160), after her father&#x27;s death she was married by her mother Salomea around 1146–48 to Theodoric I, Margrave of Lusatia, who later repudiated her.
# Judith (1130 – 8 July 1175), betrothed in 1136 to Prince Géza, son of King Béla II of Hungary; however, the marriage never took place and in 1148 she married Otto I, Margrave of Brandenburg.
# Henry (1131 – 18 October 1166), Duke of Sandomierz (1146–66), according to Jan Długosz he was born in 1132. Further mention of him was made in his chronicle by 1139, describing the division of the country in districts. Karol Maleczyński placed his birth between 1127 and 1131. During his father&#x27;s lifetime Henry didn&#x27;t play an important political role. He died in 1166 in battle against the Prussians, unmarried and childless.
# Agnes (1137 – after 1182), around 1140–41 she was a proposed bride to one of the sons of Grand Prince Vsevolod II of Kiev. This union was to ensure the support of Kiev in the dispute between Salomea&#x27;s sons and Władysław II, their half-brother. At the end, the marriage never took place and she married around 1149–51 to Mstislav II, Prince of Pereyaslavl and Grand Prince of Kiev since 1168.
# Casimir II the Just (1138 – 5 May 1194), Duke of Wiślica (1166–73), of Sandomierz (1173–94) of Kraków (1177–94), of Masovia and Kuyavia (1186–94), for a long time considered a posthumous child, and for this reason not included in his father&#x27;s testament.

Older historiography attributed another two daughters from the marriage of Bolesław and Salomea: Adelaide and Sophia. Adelaide (c. 1114 - 25 March before 1132), was the first wife of Adalbert II the Pious, eldest son of Leopold III, Margrave of Austria. Modern historians deny that she was a daughter of Bolesław. Sophia (d. 10 October 1136), was probably the mother of Mateusz, Bishop of Kraków.

In older historiography Adelaide, a supposed daughter of Emperor Henry IV, was erroneously considered to be another wife of Bolesław. The information about this stated that after the death of Zbyslava, Bolesław married her in Bamberg in 1110. This report is provided by Jan Długosz and Archdeacon Sulger. This view was challenged by Oswald Balzer.

==Succession provisions==

===Senioral principle===

Bolesław&#x27;s experiences during his youth probably motivated him to make a division of his domains among his surviving sons. The loyal Count Palatine Piotr Włostowic was appointed to execute the provisions. In his testament, also known as the &quot;Statute of Succession&quot;, Bolesław introduced the &quot;senioral principle&quot; in Poland in an effort to preserve the unity of the state and to prevent a power struggle among his sons. This regulation about the succession came into force after Bolesław&#x27;s death, although is unknown the exact date of his establishment. It is believed that its creation may have occurred in 1115 or 1116, after the birth of his son Leszek, or after the suppression of the rebellion of Skarbimir (in 1117). Sources indicate that the original document about the succession was drawn up in 1137. The Statute was nullified in 1180 but restored by Pope Innocent III in 1210 after a petition of the Silesian rulers; however, historians challenge this account in the absence of any other information.

The senioral principle established that the eldest member of the dynasty was to have supreme power over the rest and was also to control an indivisible &quot;senioral part&quot;: a vast strip of land running north–south down the middle of Poland, with Kraków its chief city. The senior duke&#x27;s prerogatives also included control over Pomerania, a fief of the Holy Roman Empire. Sources showed a discrepancy in terms of the power exercised by the senior duke. Pope Innocent III wrote about primogeniture, while Wincenty Kadłubek refers to both seniority and primogeniture. Kadłubek combined in one sentence the two systems, &quot;i.e.&quot;, inheritance of supreme power in individual districts, where primogeniture was in force. Among historians, there is a view that what Bolesław established was not seniority, but primogeniture that belongs exclusively to Władysław II and his descendants. The coverage and nature of power exercised by Bolesław IV the Curly in 1146 supports this hypothesis.

===Division of the Polish state===

Bolesław divided his domains into the following provinces:

The Seniorate Province (with his capital Kraków) was supposed to be non-inherited and indivisible. It consisted of Lesser Poland, Sieradz and Łęczyca, the western part of Kruszwica and Kuyavia, the eastern part of Greater Poland, Kalisz, Gniezno and Gdańsk Pomerania. Western Pomerania as a fief would remain under the control of the senior duke.

* Władysław II received the Silesian Province, comprising Silesia, with his capital Wrocław and the Lubusz land. He probably received this domain by 1124 or 1125 after his marriage with Agnes of Babenberg. As the eldest son, he became the first senior duke (or &quot;princeps&quot;).
* Bolesław IV received the Masovian Province, with his capital in Płock and eastern Kuyavia.
* Mieszko III received the Greater Poland Province, composed of the remaining western parts of Greater Poland, with his capital in Poznań.
* Henry received the Sandomierz Province, composed of eastern Lesser Polish territories centered around the city of Sandomierz and the Bug River to the north, with his capital in Lublin.
* Salomea, Bolesław&#x27;s widow, received Łęczyca or Sieradz-Łęczyca as her dower. After her death, these lands were to be included in the Seniorate Province.

Casimir II, Bolesław&#x27;s youngest son, was not included in the testament, because he was born after his father&#x27;s death or shortly before.

Among medievalists there is a view that the Statute only provide the inheritance of Bolesław&#x27;s descendants in the first generation (&quot;i.e.&quot;, his sons). After their deaths, their lands were to be included in the Seniorate Province. However, the later fights between them transformed the provinces into hereditary domains.

===Feudal division of Poland===

The &quot;Senioral Principle&quot; was soon broken, leading to a period of nearly 200 years of Polish disintegration, also known as feudal fragmentation, a phenomenon common in medieval Europe. Among other countries affected by this were Russia, Hungary, and Germany. This was a time of internal struggles that caused the weakening of the Polish state and the enormous growth of internal development, culture, and improvement of the situation of the broader population. Distribution of the then-princely rights by contemporary historiography also had benefits, which include: the reconstruction of the political system in the new economic fundamentals and placement of greater responsibility for the fate of the country upon its upper echelons.

==Organization of state==
A detailed knowledge of the internal organization of the 12th century Polish state is impossible. There are no documents from this period and the reports of chroniclers reflect a lack of real knowledge of the principality&#x27;s management.

Bolesław divided his domains into provinces, districts and gords (Polish: ; a type of fortified village or castellany). The &quot;Opole&quot; remained within this structure. The territorial scope of the province corresponded to the later &quot;Dzielnica&quot;. It is believed that 6–7 provinces were created: Masovia, Silesia, Greater Poland, Kraków, Sandomierz, Kalisz-Łęczyca and Pomerania (from the lands of Gdańsk Pomerania). During Bolesław&#x27;s reign attempts were made to organize the border areas into marches following the German model. Among the marches corroborated in the available sources are: Głogów, Gdańsk and probably Lubusz. Bolesław likely had a number of well-maintained castles that served political, economic and administrative roles.

The state&#x27;s nature during the Piast dynasty was patrimonial. The ducal court (Latin: &quot;curia ducis&quot;) was a center of power, which belonged to the reigning family (along with a separate court for the duchess); after them came the secular and Church dignitaries and subjects, then lower officials, knights, courtiers, and chaplains. The most important office at the court of Władysław I Herman and Bolesław was the count palatine, also known as voivode. The duties of the count palatine (Latin: &quot;comes palatinus&quot;) included major command of the military expeditions in place of the ruler, defense of the State, supervision of the administration as head of the ducal court, control and appointment of the heads of the castellanies, and the administration of the courts. The office of count palatine was abolished in 1180. The Polish bureaucracy developed as early as the reign of Mieszko II Lambert. The collector (Latin: &quot;camerarius&quot;) managed the economy of the ducal court. Among other offices in the ducal court were the cześnik (&quot;cup-bearer&quot;), the stolnik (esquire), the strażnik (guard), the miecznik (&quot;Sword-bearer&quot;), the Koniuszy (&quot;Master of the Horse&quot;) and the Łowczy (&quot;Master of the Hunt&quot;). During Bolesław&#x27;s reign appeared the office of the chancellor, who directed the work of the court offices and the ducal chapel (Latin: &quot;capella&quot;), which consisted of a bunch of secular and religious duties. Michał Awdaniec was a chancellor at this time. Also under the central government were the treasurer, the Mint Master, and others. During the rule of Bolesław the structure of the state was closely linked to the organization of the Polish Church, given that the church was subject to the ruler, who had the right of Investiture.

The ducal court was in contact with the subjects via the castellanies, who were managed by the &quot;Naczelnik&quot; or Town Chief (Latin: &quot;princeps terrae&quot;). He had sovereignty over the castellanies or gords (Latin: &quot;comes&quot;), while the castellans (grod rulers) should exercise the local civil authority, getting benefits from the public, organizing the defense and probably exercising the courts. Under the direct obligation of the ruler are the bailiff, the źupan (gastald), the minters, the celnik (tax collector) and collectors. All important functions in the principality are held by the nobility. The castellan belonged to the group of nobles, officials and ministerialis. Some had served directly to the ruler, others held the offices, while the role of others are of food shortages. The Margraves (who are in charge of the border areas) were directly subordinate to the Polish ruler and had greater power than the provincial chiefs.

At the end of the 11th century waned this princely organization. Was replaced with the Western European model of troops consisting of chivalry. The Latin term &quot;milites&quot;, which had been used to determine the soldiers came to be called the category of knights and warriors who could afford to keep a horse. Polish armed forces in Bolesław&#x27;s times are composed of three types of forces: the princely army (&quot;Oddziału nadwornego&quot;), the lord&#x27;s army (&quot;Drużyny możnowładców&quot;) and the militia (&quot;Pospolite ruszenie&quot;), composed of branches of small feudal lords and peasants (according to other views the militia adjutant troops were powerful and also composed by clergy and laity).

The princely army consisting of his nobles—at the end of the 11th century, the so-called &quot;New People&quot; (pl: &quot;Nowi Ludzie&quot;): tribal chiefs, local leaders and opolne rulers who aspired to participate in government, sent their sons to the duke&#x27;s court, where he was accompanied the ruler. Bolesław&#x27;s personal guard was probably chosen by himself, using an invocation which was written in the Chronicles of Gallus Anonymous:
:: A young people, with great manners and high birth, by at my side constantly in battle, with me accustomed to hardships!

The nobles maintained their own army, which consisted of poor knights supported by peasants. They also are responsible for their armament. Among the equipment used by them was a wooden weapons (like spear), blunt weapons (like club), cutting weapons (like sword) and belching weapons (like crossbow, bow and arrow, sling), and the so-called protective equipment (shield, helmet, armor). These armies over time become larger than the princely one, the most notorious example from this was Sieciech. During the constant conflicts at the beginning of the 12th century, the nobles invoked the militia, particularly of endangered lands. The whole militia was divided into branches, which were given the names of their native districts (for example, the &quot;Kruszwiczan hordes&quot;). In the case of an armed conflict to a greater weapon are invoked independent branches composed by peasants (for example, during 1109).

In addition to the nobles (who were tied to the ruler and his court) and warriors the Polish society in Bolesław&#x27;s times also consisted of free peasants and servants (attached to his place of residence). A distinct social group were the free people, the so-called guests (Latin: &quot;hospites&quot;) -who do not own property-, the warriors (Latin: &quot;milites gregarii&quot;) who had farms and are counted into the common people. At the end of the social scale are the slaves (brańcy of war, or their descendants). There are little difference between them and the free peasants, but their duty to their master was higher. Non-free population was also used for personal services or to work on the land in favor of the ruler.

All aspects of life in the state were regulated by the ducal judge (Latin: &quot;ius ducale&quot;). He covered all the rights of the duke, in relation to the subjects or property, the enforcement of a variety of benefits, dues and ministries. The expanded state apparatus and the church maintained by benefits from the population producing material goods. The main burden of the tax rests on the lowest social class: the peasantry (Latin: &quot;heredes, rustici ducis, possesores&quot;). Up to them to submit certain levies, tithes, and other forms of taxes like the &quot;podworowe&quot; (in the form of a cow, which consisted of the entire village), &quot;podymne&quot; (for every house), &quot;poradlne&quot; (for each piece of land), &quot;narzazu&quot; (for grazing pigs in the woods), the &quot;stacji&quot; or &quot;stanu&quot; (who allow the maintenance of the duke&#x27;s court) and the &quot;posług komunikacyjnych&quot;, who regulated the transport ways in the country and was divided in three main taxes: &quot;przewód&quot; (&quot;the cable&quot;), &quot;powóz&quot; (&quot;the carriage&quot;) and &quot;podwód&quot; (&quot;the wagon&quot;). Other minor taxes involved hunting, military, guards (who had custody the gords), taxes on regalia and criminal penalties. In addition, subjects were required to repair roads, bridges, construction and maintenance of castles.

==Seals and coinage==

Of the five oldest preserved seals from Polish rulers four were discovered in various places during 2002–06, while one of more than 100 years ago. Polish archaeologists made further discoveries in Głębokie (2002), in Ostrów Tumski (2005), in Gniezno (2005) and in an undisclosed location in the village of Susk near Sierpc, 32 km. from Płock (2006). The first preliminary studies suggested that the seals could belonged to Bolesław III Wrymouth. They are made of lead, a durable material, with a diameter of 36–40 mm. The lead seals are used at that time in European courts and are from the &quot;Bulla&quot; tipe. Seals are known in municipal and military orders. Occasionally, in the most important documents (acts) were used golden bullas.

The discovered bullas from Bolesław&#x27;s reign fall into two major types, differing in the form of writing:

* Type I: extended stored on the obverse in the genitive, with the Latin word &quot;sigillum&quot;. 
* Type II: short and around the bulla.

One example from both type of seals came from the relationship with St. Adalbert, where he emphasizes his pontifical recognition (in type I) and in the crosier, with the gesture of the imposition of hands, clearly visible in the seals after restoration (in type II). The use of the genitive seals in Poland came from the 12th century, a phenomenon (unprecedented), with its only then monetary equivalent in the denarius with the Latin legend: &quot;Denarivs ducis Bolezlai&quot;. At the end of Bolesław&#x27;s reign returned to the staid mold inscriptions with the Latin legend: &quot;Dvx Bolezlavus&quot;. According to S. Suchodolski the bullas were used for the authentication of princely documents like letters, privileges, judgments, etc., and by T. Jurek, they could also be used to secure the business arrangements (like buy of doors, chests, reliquaries).

In October 2006, the Poznań Society of Friends of Learning has confirmed that the discovered bullas during 2002–05 belonged to Bolesław III Wrymouth.
During Bolesław&#x27;s reign appeared a two-sided denarius, which was denominated the foreign coin (Polish: &quot;monetą obcą&quot;). The first known denarius from this time bears the Latin legend &quot;Bolezlav&quot;. For the others most commonly used coins bears the Latin inscription &quot;Bolezlavs, denarivus, dicis Bolezlai&quot; with St. Adalbert in the reverse. Another type of coins didn&#x27;t have legends. They differ mostly came from the weight: they were much lighter, punched for purely economic purposes.
In this time was also modeled mainly on the Magdeburg technique a bracteate, who was one of the oldest in Europe. There are two types of bracteates who dated from Bolesław&#x27;s reign:

* The type II shows in both sides before Bolesław and St. Adalbert, who put his hand over the ruler in a gesture of protection. The legend shows the Latin inscription &quot;Bolezlaus Adalbertus&quot;. This bracteate initially was considered a way of penance from Bolesław for Zbigniew&#x27;s blinding. Was probably minted in Kraków around 1127.
* The type I is less frequent. Showed St. Adalbert in episcopal robes, holding a crozier and Gospel. Legend of the coin determines the form of the Archbishop of Gniezno. Further studies have shown that the coin was minted between the period of the Congress of Merseburg (1135) and Bolesław&#x27;s death (1138). It is now called the &quot;protective&quot;, since illustrates the protection of St. Adalbert to the Polish ruler, who after his homage to the Holy Roman Empire in 1135 only recognizes the saint as his protector. It is one of the few examples of political propaganda in the coin&#x27;s legend. According to A. Schmidt this was an Archbishop&#x27;s coin which was minted in Gniezno, probably in 1135.

In addition to the two presented bracteates from Bolesław&#x27;s there is one, which is now counted among the oldest known in numismatics. This bracteate was found in Brzeg (in Gmina Pęczniew) and preserved almost the 2/3 part of the whole weight of 0.61 g and a diameter of 27 mm. The coin shows the figure of the ruler with crown, sword in hand and an outstretched hand. Initially, was believed that showed Władysław II the Exile. Further studies, included by A. Mikolajczyk, identified this image with Bolesław III Wrymouth. Among researchers, however, today, there are discrepancies about what ruler showed the coin, because the inscription preserved is incomplete.

Princely mints are mostly located in Wrocław, Płock, Gniezno and Kraków. In that time also existed private mints, such as Palatine Sieciech, who placed them in Sieciechów and near Kraków.

==Church foundations==
It was customary during the 12th-century for ruling families to engage in wide-ranging religious activities like donations in the benefit of the Church. The main objective was to spread Christianity. This was to legitimize religious rulers in the face of God, church hierarchs, clergy and society. Bolesław was not the exception, and he was not only a predatory warrior, a cunning politician and a diplomat; he was also a patron of cultural developments in his realm.

Like most medieval monarchs, he founded several churches and monasteries. Among the most important of which are: 
* The Benedictine monastery of Holy Cross atop the Łysa Góra which was founded in place of an ancient pagan temple. The first Abbot of this monastery, Boguchwał, wrote about the foundation and the Duke:

:: &quot;The pious Duke Bolesław founded in Łysa Góra an Abbey dedicated to the Holy Trinity with monks of the Order of St. Benedict&quot;.

Stored documents from about 1427 (called the &quot;świętokrzyskie dokumenty pergaminowe&quot;) confirm the history of the Bishop, adding that the co-founder of the monastery was the knight Wojsław.
* The St. Giles-Church in Inowłódz was built in the Romanesque style. According to a modern plate inscription (presumably from the 17th century) this temple was built in 1082 by Władysław I Herman. However, modern research revealed that the foundation of the Church was probably during the 12th century (at the latest from 1138) and the founder was Bolesław.
* The Collegiate Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Ostrów Tumski was founded thanks to the donations of Haymo, Bishop of Wrocław and &quot;comes&quot; Wojsław in 1120, following the reports of the 15th-century &quot;Rocznika głogowskiego&quot;. Modern scholars believed that the founder was Bolesław (T. Lalik), or the foundation was made by Bishop Haymo and Wojsław with the consent of the Duke (H. Gerlic) or was a foundation made by Bishop Haymo and Bolesław (T. Jurek). In earlier studies of the history of Silesia existed the opinion that Bolesław founded the Collegiate as a gesture of gratitude for the loyalty and bravery of the people of Głogów and also as a way of penance for Zbigniew&#x27;s blinding.
* The Benedictine Abbey in Tyniec according to some hypotheses was also founded by Bolesław. In 1124 the Papal legate issued the confirmation of the goods received from the Abbey&#x27;s estates.
* The Abbey of Lubiń was restored during 1137–38 by Bolesław and the Awdaniec family.
* The Wawel Cathedral was completed during Bolesław&#x27;s reign. In 1118 Bishop Maurus was buried there.
* The Canons regular of St. Augustine in Trzemeszno was probably founded by Bolesław. Evidence of this was in a document issued by Mieszko III the Old in 1145.
The connection of Bolesław and his second wife Salomea with the Swabian monastery of Zwiefalten was well known. The detailed description of Berthold of Zwiefalten was the only evidence of the cultural, artistic and religious development of the 12th-century Polish court:

:: The Polish Duke Bolesław sent the black cover choirs black, sewn white oxen [...] the gold, the silver, and the tablecloths, and especially in the most numerous of any kind of valuable furs to this monastery more than seventy grzywna. Salomea, his wife, sent gold woven stole, two alb knitted silk and silver pitcher with four grzywna on the box of ivory studded with gold, to draw up the choir covers his red coat decorated with gold stripes, and another coat on for the Mass all interwoven gold, dissuaded gold stripes and bottom trimmed with red frames, which according to the custom of the people is decorated with golden stars, curtain wall, one with a silk frames, the other adorned with white lions and the third red in the white list, [...] a hand from Saint Stephen the Martyr [...], a large piece of the Holy Cross, a tooth from Saint John the Baptist, a tooth from Saint Pancras, a tooth of Saint Cecilia, some of the blood of Christ, milk of the Virgin Mary and a chain of Saint Peter. In addition, one hundred pounds of silver, one gold appliqué alb, a cross gold weighing more than four fine gold, a silver gilt chalice, a silver plated pitcher of nearly six fines, a stole embroidered with gold, together with a scarf, a belt, a dalmatic all woven of gold, with the value of fifty and more brands, one black tunic with gold appliqué, a scarf and a cloth interwoven with gold, which together can have a value of twenty grzywna, a curtain wall, knitted silk, one box of ivory, one beautiful crystal vessel, three horses, two ounces of gold, two coats, one of which [...] ermine, a bishop&#x27;s miter with gloves, on four fine and three coats of other goodies.

The same source mentioned that the golden cross donated to the monastery was made by master Leopard, who worked for the Polish ruler during 1129–37.

The Reliquary of 1113 is an example of the artistic development during Bolesław&#x27;s rule; was made during the penitential journey to the tomb of Saint Adalbert in Gniezno Cathedral after the blinding of Zbigniew, according to the reports the Gallus Anonymous:

:: The evidence of the great work of goldsmiths, Bolesław had made on a relic of the Saint, as a testimony to his devotion and penance. Half coffin contains in itself 80 grzywna, the purest gold, not counting the pearls and precious stones that probably matched the value of the gold.

The Reliquary contained the head of Saint Adalbert. At the end of the 15th century it was melted in order to make a new one. According to the notes of 1494, it had the form of an octagonal shrine. The side walls have the shape of squares and were separated by small columns, which were based on the figures of saints or prophets. The monument was decorated with 8 pearls and 40 sapphires.

==Polish historiography during Bolesław&#x27;s reign==

During his rule, Bolesław wanted the history of the Piast dynasty to be chronicled. This task was assigned to an unnamed Benedictine monk (Historians have coined the name Gallus Anonymous for the chronicler). Research has suggested multiple hypotheses for the monk&#x27;s origin, finding connections to Venetian, French, Hungarian, etc.

The &quot;Gesta Chronica Polonorum&quot;, written in Latin, was made between 1112 and 1116. The history of the State (Latin: &quot;gesta ducum&quot;) was made describing the fate of the rulers. The Chronicle covers the history from legendary times until 1114. Composed of three parts, this unfinished literary work justified the right of the Piasts to rule over Poland. The Chronicle also explain many controversial events that were placed under the responsibility of the rulers, and give a full explanation about their policy.

<text>Year 222 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Marcellus and Calvus (or, less frequently, year 532 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 222 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Roman Republic ====
* The Roman consuls Marcus Claudius Marcellus and Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus march into Insubres territory and besiege Acerrae, an Insubre fortification on the right bank of the River Adda between Cremona and Laus Pompeia. The Insubres are unable to relieve Acerrae because the Romans control all the strategic points around it. Therefore, they hire 30,000 Gaesatae mercenaries, led by Viridomarus (or Britomartus), who march to Clastidium, an important and strategically situated town, owned by the Marici, a Ligurian tribe allied to the Romans, they start a siege hoping that this will force the Romans to lift their siege of Acerrae to come to Clastidium&#x27;s aid.
*The Romans split their forces. Marcus Claudius Marcellus heads for Clastidium while his colleague Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus continues the siege of Acerrae. At the Battle of Clastidium Marcellus defeats the Gaesatae. Marcellus personally slays Viridomarus. This victory removes the Gallic threat to Rome. Marcellus is awarded the spolia opima for the third and last time in Roman history.
* After taking Acerrae Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus marches on Mediolanum (modern Milan), another stronghold of the Insubres, which also falls into Roman hands, upon which the chieftains of the Insubres lose all hope and surrendered unconditionally. Thus the Romans succeeded in conquering the largest independent Celtic tribe in Italy and firmly established their hegemony over the Po Valley, then the most productive agricultural region in the peninsula.

==== Greece ====
*Battle of Sellasia: Cleomenes III of Sparta is defeated by Antigonus III of Macedon and his allies (the Achaean League, the Boeotian League, the Acarnanians, Epirus and the Illyrians under the command of Demetrius of Pharos) near Sellasia (north of Sparta) and flees to Egypt under the protection of King Ptolemy III. Antigonus III&#x27;s forces occupy Sparta, which is the first time this city has ever been occupied.
* Almost all of Greece falls under Macedonian suzerainty after Antigonus III re-establishes the Hellenic Alliance as a confederacy of leagues, with himself as president.

==== Seleucid Empire ====
* Seleucid forces under their general Achaeus succeed in winning back all the Seleucid domains in Asia Minor (lost six years earlier to Pergamum).
* Mithridates II of Pontus gives his daughter Laodice in marriage to the Seleucid king Antiochus III. Another of his daughters, also named Laodice, is married about the same time to Achaeus, a cousin of Antiochus.

==== China ====
* The Qin general Wang Jian conquers Wuyue, forcing the capitulation of its ruler. The conquered region becomes the province of Kuaiji. This campaign completes the subjugation of the lands formerly held by the State of Chu, and it also serves as a precursor for the Qin campaign against the Yue tribes.
* The Qin generals Wang Ben and Li Xin conquer Liaodong, thereby completing the subjugation of Yan.
* Wang Ben conquers Dai, thereby completing the subjugation of Zhao.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Deaths ==
* Ctesibius, Greek inventor and mathematician
* Eucleidas, king of Sparta (killed in the Battle of Sellasia)
* Ptolemy III Euergetes (the Benefactor), king of Egypt
* Viridomarus, military leader of the Gaesatae (Gaul)
* Xi of Yan, king of the Yan State (Warring States Period)

<doc id="60757" wikidata="Q53455" url="?curid=60757" title="Casimir I the Restorer">
<text>Casimir I the Restorer (; 25 July 1016 – 19 March 1058), a member of the Piast dynasty, was the duke of Poland from 1040 until his death. Casimir was the son of Mieszko II Lambert and Richeza of Lotharingia. He is known as the Restorer because he managed to reunite parts of the Kingdom of Poland after a period of turmoil. He reincorporated Masovia and conquered Silesia and Pomerania. However, he failed to crown himself King of Poland, mainly because of internal and external threats to his rule.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Relatively little is known of Casimir&#x27;s early life. He must have spent his childhood at the royal court of Poland in Gniezno. In order to acquire a proper education, he was sent to one of the Polish monasteries in 1026. According to some older sources he initially wanted to have a career in the Church (it is probable that he held the post of oblate) and even asked for a dispensation to become a monk. This hypothesis, however, is not supported by modern historians. Regardless, he left church work indefinitely in 1031.

Casimir&#x27;s father, Mieszko II, was crowned King of Poland in 1025 after the death of his father, Bolesław the Brave. However, the powerful magnates of the country feared a strong central government like the one that existed under Bolesław I&#x27;s rule. This led to considerable friction between the King and the nobility. Taking advantage of the King&#x27;s precarious situation, Mieszko II&#x27;s older half-brother Bezprym and younger brother Otto turned against him and allied themselves with the Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II, whose forces attacked Poland and regained Lusatia. Years of chaos and conflict followed, during which Mieszko II was forced to cede the throne to Bezprym in 1031, fled to Bohemia, was imprisoned by Duke Oldřich and castrated, returned to rule a portion of the kingdom, eventually regained the kingdom, and then died in May 1034 under suspicious circumstances.

Sometime during the reign of Bezprym, Casimir and his sisters were taken by their mother to Germany (her native land) for refuge. It has been reported that Queen Richeza brought the Polish royal crown and regalia to Emperor Conrad II at Bezprym&#x27;s request to indicate his acceptance of the primacy of his western neighbor, although the Queen could have taken them for safekeeping, or they could have been brought to the Emperor by another means. At the time of his father&#x27;s death in 1034, Casimir was about 18 years old and in Germany at the court of his uncle Archbishop Hermann II of Cologne.

===Bolesław I===
The central district of Greater Poland (&quot;Wielkopolska&quot;) revolted against the nobles and Catholic clergy &quot;en masse&quot;. A pagan revival in the area lasted for several years. The district of Masovia seceded and a local lord, Miecław, formed a state of his own. A similar situation occurred in Pomerania.

In 1037 both the young prince and his mother returned to Poland and attempted to seize the throne. This precipitated a rebellion by local barons, which coupled with the so-called &quot;Pagan Reaction&quot; of the commoners, forced Casimir and Richeza to flee to Saxony. However, soon Casimir returned to Poland and in 1038, once again, tried to regain power with the aide of his influential mother. This also failed and he had to flee again, this time to the Kingdom of Hungary where he was imprisoned by Stephen I. Richeza remained in Germany as a nun until her death, in 1063.

Taking advantage of the chaos and his neighbour&#x27;s weakness, Duke Bretislaus I of Bohemia invaded and ravaged the country in 1039. Lesser and Greater Poland were severely pillaged, Poznań was captured, and Bretislaus sacked Gniezno, taking the relics of Saint Adalbert, Radim Gaudentius, and the five hermit brothers with him. On the way back he conquered part of Silesia, including Wrocław, destroyed religious buildings which were built by Mieszko I during the feast of the conversion of Poland, and plundered Mieszko I&#x27;s tomb.

===Restoration===

After initially escaping to Hungary, Casimir went to Germany, where in 1039 his relative Emperor Henry III (who feared the increased power of the Bohemian ruler) gave him military and financial support. Casimir received a force of 1,000 heavy footmen and a significant amount of gold to restore his power in Poland. Casimir also signed an alliance with Yaroslav I the Wise, the Prince of Kievan Rus&#x27;, who was linked with him through Casimir&#x27;s marriage with Yaroslav&#x27;s sister, Maria Dobroniega. With this support, Casimir returned to Poland and managed to retake most of his domain. In 1041, Bretislaus, defeated in his second attempted invasion by Emperor Henry III, signed a treaty at Regensburg (1042) in which he renounced his claims to all Polish lands except for Silesia, which was to be incorporated into the Bohemian Kingdom. It was Casimir&#x27;s success in strengthening royal power and ending internal strife that earned him the epithet of &quot;the Restorer&quot;.

The treaty gained Casimir a period of peace on the southern border and the capital of Poland was moved to Kraków, the only major Polish city untouched by the wars. It is probable that the Holy Roman Emperor was pleased with the balance of power that had been restored to the region and forced Casimir not to crown himself the King of Poland. In 1046 Emperor Henry III held royal and imperial courts at Merseburg and Meissen, at which he ended the strife among the Duke of Pomerania (&quot;Dux Bomeraniorum&quot;), Duke Bretislaus of Bohemia, and Casimir I.

In 1047 Casimir, aided by his Kievan brother-in-law, started a war against Masovia and seized the land. It is probable that he also defeated Miecław&#x27;s allies from Pomerania and attached Gdańsk to Poland. This secured his power in central Poland. Three years later, against the will of the Emperor, Casimir seized Bohemian-controlled Silesia, thus securing most of his father&#x27;s domain. In 1054 in Quedlinburg, the Emperor ruled that Silesia was to remain in Poland in exchange for a yearly tribute of 117 kg. of silver and 7 kg. of gold.

At that time Casimir was focused on internal matters. To strengthen his rule he re-created the bishopric in Kraków and Wrocław and erected the new Wawel Cathedral. During Casimir&#x27;s rule heraldry was introduced into Poland and, unlike his predecessors, he promoted landed gentry over the &quot;drużyna&quot; as his base of power. One of his reforms was the introduction, to Poland, of a key element of feudalism: the granting of fiefdoms to his retinue of warriors, thus gradually transforming them into medieval knights.

==Marriage and issue==
Casimir married Maria Dobroniega (c. 1012–1087), daughter of Grand Duke Vladimir I of Kiev. There is no consensus among historians as to when it took place. Władymir D. Koroliuk said that it was in 1039, Aleksej A. Szachmatow and Iwan Linniczenko agreed on 1041, while Dymitr S. Lichaczew postulated that it occurred during 1043.

Casimir and Maria had five children:
#Bolesław II the Bold (c. 1043 – 2/3 April 1081/82)
#Władysław I Herman (c. 1044 – 4 June 1102)
#Mieszko (16 April 1045 – 28 January 1065)
#Otto (c. 1046–1048).
#Świętosława (c. 1048 – 1 September 1126), married c. 1062 to Duke (from 1085, King) Vratislaus II of Bohemia

<text>The Box–Muller transform, by George Edward Pelham Box and Mervin Edgar Muller, is a random number sampling method for generating pairs of independent, standard, normally distributed (zero expectation, unit variance) random numbers, given a source of uniformly distributed random numbers. The method was first mentioned explicitly by Raymond E. A. C. Paley and Norbert Wiener in their 1934 treatise on Fourier transforms in the complex domain. Given the status of these latter authors and the widespread availability and use of their treatise, it is almost certain that Box and Muller were well aware of its contents.

The Box–Muller transform is commonly expressed in two forms. The basic form as given by Box and Muller takes two samples from the uniform distribution on the interval and maps them to two standard, normally distributed samples. The polar form takes two samples from a different interval, , and maps them to two normally distributed samples without the use of sine or cosine functions.

The Box–Muller transform was developed as a more computationally efficient alternative to the inverse transform sampling method. The ziggurat algorithm gives a more efficient method for scalar processors (e.g. old CPUs), while the Box–Muller transform is superior for processors with vector units (e.g. GPUs or modern CPUs).

==Basic form==
Suppose and are independent samples chosen from the uniform distribution on the unit interval . Let
formula_1
and
formula_2

Then &quot;Z&quot;0 and &quot;Z&quot;1 are independent random variables with a standard normal distribution.

The derivation is based on a property of a two-dimensional Cartesian system, where X and Y coordinates are described by two independent and normally distributed random variables, the random variables for and (shown above) in the corresponding polar coordinates are also independent and can be expressed as
formula_3
and
formula_4

Because is the square of the norm of the standard bivariate normal variable , it has the chi-squared distribution with two degrees of freedom. In the special case of two degrees of freedom, the chi-squared distribution coincides with the exponential distribution, and the equation for above is a simple way of generating the required exponential variate.

==Polar form==

 The polar form was first proposed by J. Bell and then modified by R. Knop. While several different versions of the polar method have been described, the version of R. Knop will be described here because it is the most widely used, in part due to its inclusion in &quot;Numerical Recipes&quot;. A slightly different form is described as &quot;Algorithm P&quot; by D. Knuth in &quot;The Art of Computer Programming&quot;.

Given and , independent and uniformly distributed in the closed interval , set . If or , discard &quot;u&quot; and &quot;v&quot;, and try another pair . Because and are uniformly distributed and because only points within the unit circle have been admitted, the values of &quot;s&quot; will be uniformly distributed in the open interval , too. The latter can be seen by calculating the cumulative distribution function for &quot;s&quot; in the interval . This is the area of a circle with radius formula_5, divided by formula_6. From this we find the probability density function to have the constant value 1 on the interval . Equally so, the angle θ divided by formula_7 is uniformly distributed in the interval and independent of .

We now identify the value of &quot;s&quot; with that of &quot;U&quot;1 and formula_8 with that of &quot;U&quot;2 in the basic form. As shown in the figure, the values of formula_9 and formula_10 in the basic form can be replaced with the ratios formula_11 and formula_12, respectively. The advantage is that calculating the trigonometric functions directly can be avoided. This is helpful when trigonometric functions are more expensive to compute than the single division that replaces each one.

Just as the basic form produces two standard normal deviates, so does this alternate calculation.
formula_13
and
formula_14

==Contrasting the two forms==
The polar method differs from the basic method in that it is a type of rejection sampling. It discards some generated random numbers, but can be faster than the basic method because it is simpler to compute (provided that the random number generator is relatively fast) and is more numerically robust. Avoiding the use of expensive trigonometric functions improves speed over the basic form. It discards of the total input uniformly distributed random number pairs generated, i.e. discards uniformly distributed random number pairs per Gaussian random number pair generated, requiring input random numbers per output random number.

The basic form requires two multiplications, 1/2 logarithm, 1/2 square root, and one trigonometric function for each normal variate. On some processors, the cosine and sine of the same argument can be calculated in parallel using a single instruction. Notably for Intel-based machines, one can use the fsincos assembler instruction or the expi instruction (usually available from C as an intrinsic function), to calculate complex
formula_15
and just separate the real and imaginary parts.

Note: 
To explicitly calculate the complex-polar form use the following substitutions in the general form,

Let formula_16 and formula_17 Then
formula_18

The polar form requires 3/2 multiplications, 1/2 logarithm, 1/2 square root, and 1/2 division for each normal variate. The effect is to replace one multiplication and one trigonometric function with a single division and a conditional loop.

==Tails truncation==
When a computer is used to produce a uniform random variable it will inevitably have some inaccuracies because there is a lower bound on how close numbers can be to 0. If the generator uses 32 bits per output value, the smallest non-zero number that can be generated is formula_19. When formula_20 and formula_21 are equal to this the Box–Muller transform produces a normal random deviate equal to formula_22. This means that the algorithm will not produce random variables more than 6.660 standard deviations from the mean. This corresponds to a proportion of formula_23 lost due to the truncation, where formula_24 is the standard cumulative normal distribution. With 64 bits the limit is pushed to formula_25 standard deviations, for which formula_26.

==Implementation==

=== C++ ===
The standard Box–Muller transform generates values from the standard normal distribution (&quot;i.e.&quot; standard normal deviates) with mean &quot;0&quot; and standard deviation &quot;1&quot;. The implementation below in standard C++ generates values from any normal distribution with mean formula_27 and variance formula_28. If formula_29 is a standard normal deviate, then formula_30 will have a normal distribution with mean formula_27 and standard deviation formula_32. The random number generator has been seeded to ensure that new, pseudo-random values will be returned from sequential calls to the codice_1 function.
#include &lt;cmath&gt;
#include &lt;limits&gt;
#include &lt;random&gt;
#include &lt;utility&gt;

//&quot;mu&quot; is the mean of the distribution, and &quot;sigma&quot; is the standard deviation.
std::pair&lt;double, double&gt; generateGaussianNoise(double mu, double sigma)
 constexpr double two_pi = 2.0 * M_PI;

 //initialize the random uniform number generator (runif) in a range 0 to 1
 static std::mt19937 rng(std::random_device{}()); // Standard mersenne_twister_engine seeded with rd()
 static std::uniform_real_distribution&lt;&gt; runif(0.0, 1.0);

 //create two random numbers, make sure u1 is greater than zero
 double u1, u2;
 do
 u1 = runif(rng);
 while (u1 == 0);
 u2 = runif(rng);

 //compute z0 and z1
 auto mag = sigma * sqrt(-2.0 * log(u1));
 auto z0 = mag * cos(two_pi * u2) + mu;
 auto z1 = mag * sin(two_pi * u2) + mu;

 return std::make_pair(z0, z1);


=== JavaScript ===

/* Syntax:
 * [ x, y ] = rand_normal();

 let R = Math.sqrt(-2 * Math.log(Math.random()));
 let x = R * Math.cos(pi);
 let y = R * Math.sin(pi);

 return [ x, y ];

<text>Pashtunistan ()or Pakhtunistan is a historical region on the crossroads of Central and South Asia, located on the Iranian Plateau, inhabited by the Pashtun people of southern and eastern Afghanistan and northwestern Pakistan, wherein Pashtun culture, the Pashto language, and identity have been based. Alternative names historically used for the region include [[Names of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Pashtūnkhwā]] or Pakhtūnkhwā (), Pathānistān, or simply the Pashtun Belt.

During British rule in India in 1893, Mortimer Durand drew the Durand Line, fixing the limits of the spheres of influence between the Emirate of Afghanistan and British India during the Great Game and leaving about half of historical Pashtun territory under British colonial rule; after the partition of British India, the Durand Line now forms the internationally recognized border between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The traditional Pashtun homeland stretches roughly from the areas south of the Amu River in Afghanistan to the areas west of the Indus River in Pakistan; it predominantly comprises the southwestern, eastern and some northern and western districts of Afghanistan, as well as most of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and northern Balochistan in Pakistan. The region is bordered by Punjab and Hazara to the east, Balochistan to the south, Kohistan and Chitral to the north, and Hazarajat and Tajik-inhabited territory to the west.

The 16th-century revolutionary leader Bayazid Pir Roshan of Waziristan and the 17th-century &quot;warrior-poet&quot; Khushal Khan Khattak assembled Pashtun armies to fight against the Mughal Empire in the region. During this time, the eastern parts of Pashtunistan were ruled by the Mughals while the western parts were ruled by Safavid Iran. Pashtunistan first gained an autonomous status in 1709, when Mirwais Hotak successfully revolted against the Safavids in Loy Kandahar. The Pashtuns later achieved unity under the leadership of Ahmad Shah Durrani, who founded the Durrani dynasty and established the Afghan Empire in 1747. In the 19th century, however, the Afghan Empire lost large parts of its eastern territory to the Sikh Empire and later the British Empire. Many famous Indian independence activists emerged from the region include Abdul Ghaffar Khan and his anti colonial Khudai Khidmatgar movement to free the region from British control. In 1969, the autonomous princely states of Swat, Dir, Chitral, and Amb were merged into the Pakistani NWFP. In 2018, the Pashtun-majority Federally Administered Tribal Areas, formerly an autonomous buffer zone with Afghanistan, were also merged into the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (previously known as the NWFP), fully integrating the region with Pakistan proper.

The Pashtuns practice &quot;Pashtunwali&quot;, the indigenous culture of the Pashtuns, and this remains significant for many Pashtuns. Although the Pashtuns are politically separated by the Durand Line between Pakistan and Afghanistan, many Pashtun tribes from the FATA area and the adjacent regions of Afghanistan, tend to ignore the border and cross back and forth with relative ease to attend weddings, family functions and take part in the joint tribal councils known as &quot;jirgas&quot;. Depending on the source, the ethnic Pashtuns constitute 42-60% of the population of Afghanistan. In neighboring Pakistan they constitute 18 percent of over the 241 million population, which does not include Pashtun diaspora in other Pakistani cities and provinces.

==Origin of term==
The name used for the region during the Middle Ages and up until the 20th century was Afghanistan. Afghanistan is a reference to this land by its ethnicity, which were the Afghans, while Pashtunistan is a reference to this land by its language. Mention of this land by the name of Afghanistan predates mention by the name of Pashtunistan, which has been mentioned by Ahmad Shah Durrani in his famous couplet, by 6th-century Indian astronomer Varāhamihira, 7th-century Chinese pilgrim Hiven Tsiang, 14th-century Moroccan scholar Ibn Battuta, Mughal Emperor Babur, 16th-century historian Firishta and many others.

The Pashto name Pakhtunistan or Pashtunistan ( ) evolved originally from the Indian word &quot;Pathanistan&quot; (Hindustani: , पठानिस्तान ). The concept of Pashtunistan was inspired by the term &quot;Pakhtunkhwa&quot;. British Indian leaders, including the Khudai Khidmatgar, started using the word &quot;Pathanistan&quot; to refer to the region, and later, the word &quot;Pashtunistan&quot; became more popular.

==The native people==
The native or indigenous people of Pashtunistan are the Pashtuns (also known as Pakhtuns, Pathans and historically as ethnic Afghans), an Iranic ethnic group. They are the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan and the second largest in Pakistan. The Pashtuns are concentrated mainly in the south and east of Afghanistan but also exist in northern and western parts of the country as a minority group. In Pakistan they are concentrated in the west and north-west, inhabiting mainly Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and northern Balochistan. In addition, communities of Pashtuns are found in other parts of Pakistan such as Sindh, Punjab, Gilgit-Baltistan and in the nation&#x27;s capital, Islamabad. The main language spoken in the delineated Pashtunistan region is Pashto. Depending on the region other languages are also spoken such as Dari in Afghanistan and Gujari, Balochi, Hindko, and Urdu in Pakistan.

The Pashtuns practice &quot;Pashtunwali&quot;, the indigenous culture of the Pashtuns, and this pre-Islamic identity remains significant for many Pashtuns and is one of the factors that have kept the Pashtunistan issue alive. Although the Pashtuns are politically separated by the Durand Line between Pakistan and Afghanistan, many Pashtun tribes from the FATA area and the adjacent regions of Afghanistan, tend to ignore the border and cross back and forth with relative ease to attend weddings, family functions and take part in the joint tribal councils known as &quot;jirgas&quot;. Though this was common before the war on terror but after several military operations conducted in FATA, this cross border movement is checked via military and has become much less common in comparison to the past.

Depending on the source, the ethnic Pashtuns constitute 42-60% of the population of Afghanistan. In neighboring Pakistan they constitute 15.42 percent of the 200 million population, which does not include Pashtun diaspora in other Pakistani cities and provinces. In the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province of Pakistan, Pashto speakers constitute above 73 percent of the population as of 1998.

==History==
Since the 2nd millennium BC, the region now inhabited by the native Pashtun people had been conquered by Ancient Iranian peoples, the Medes, Achaemenids, Greeks, Mauryas, Kushans, Hephthalites, Sasanians, Arab Muslims, Turks, Mughals, and others. In recent age, people of the Western world have nominally explored the area.

Arab Muslims arrived in the 7th century and began introducing Islam to the native Pashtun people. The Pashtunistan area later fell to the Turkish Ghaznavids whose main capital was at Ghazni, with Lahore serving as the second power house. The Ghaznavid Empire was then taken over by the Ghorids from today&#x27;s Ghor, Afghanistan. The army of Genghis Khan arrived in the 13th century and began destroying cities in the north while the Pashtun territory was defended by the Khalji dynasty of Delhi. In the 14th and 15th century, the Timurid dynasty was in control of the nearby cities and towns, until Babur captured Kabul in 1504.

===Delhi Sultanate and the last Afghan Empire===
During the Delhi Sultanate era, the region was ruled by mainly Afghan and various, largely Sunni, Hanafi-jurisprudential driven Turkic dynasties from Delhi, India. An early Pashtun nationalist was the &quot;Warrior-poet&quot; Khushal Khan Khattak, who was imprisoned by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb for trying to incite the Pashtuns to rebel against the rule of the Mughals. However, despite sharing a common language and believing in a common ancestry, the Pashtuns first achieved unity in the 18th century. The eastern parts of &quot;Pashtunistan&quot; were ruled by the Mughal Empire, while the western parts were ruled by the Persian Safavids as their easternmost provinces. During the early 18th century, Pashtun tribes led by Mirwais Hotak successfully revolted against the Safavids in the city of Kandahar. In a chain of events, he declared Kandahar and other parts of what is now southern Afghanistan independent. By 1738 the Mughal Empire had been crushingly defeated and their capital sacked and looted by forces of a new Iranian ruler; the military genius and commander Nader Shah. Besides Persian, Turkmen, and Caucasian forces, Nader was also accompanied by the young Ahmad Shah Durrani, and 4,000 well trained Abdali Pashtun troops from what is now Afghanistan.

After the death of Nader Shah in 1747 and the disintegration of his massive empire, Ahmad Shah Durrani created his own large and powerful Durrani Empire, which included all of modern-day Afghanistan, North east Iran, Sindh, Punjab, Baluchistan and Kashmir. The famous couplet by Ahmad Shah Durrani describes the association the people have with the regional city of Kandahar:

&quot;Da Dili takht herauma cheh rayad kam zama da khkule Pukhtunkhwa da ghre saroona&quot;.
Translation: &quot;I forget the throne of Delhi when I recall the mountain peaks of my beautiful Pukhtunkhwa.&quot;
The last Afghan Empire was established in 1747 and united all the different Pashtun tribes as well as many other ethnic groups. Parts of the Pashtunistan region around Peshawar was invaded by Ranjit Singh and his Sikh army in the early part of the 19th century, but a few years later they were defeated by the British Raj, the new powerful empire which reached the Pashtunistan region from the east.

===European influence===
Following the decline of the Durrani dynasty and the establishment of the new Barakzai dynasty in Afghanistan, the Pashtun domains began to shrink as they lost control over other parts of South Asia to the British, such as the Punjab region and the Balochistan region. The Anglo-Afghan Wars were fought as part of the overall imperialistic Great Game that was waged between the Russian Empire and the British. Poor and landlocked, newly born Afghanistan was able to defend its territory and keep both sides at bay by using them against each other. In 1893, as part of a way for fixing the limit of their respective spheres of influence, the Durand Line Agreement was signed between Afghan &quot;Iron&quot; Amir Abdur Rahman and British Viceroy Mortimer Durand. In 1905, the North-West Frontier Province (today&#x27;s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) was created and roughly corresponded to Pashtun majority regions within the British domain. The FATA area was created to further placate the Pashtun tribesmen who never fully accepted British rule and were prone to rebellions, while the city of Peshawar was directly administered as part of a British protectorate state with full integration into the federal rule of law with the establishment of civic amenities and the construction of railway, road infrastructure as well as educational institutes to bring the region at par with the developed world.

During World War I, the Afghan government was contacted by the Ottoman Turkey and Germany, through the Niedermayer–Hentig Mission, to join the Central Allies on behalf of the Caliph in a Jihad; some revolutionaries, tribals, and Afghan leaders including a brother of the Amir named Nasrullah Khan were in favour of the delegation and wanted the Amir to declare Jihad. Kazim Bey carried a firman from the Khalifa in Persian. It was addressed to &quot;the residents of Pathanistan.&quot; It said that when the British were defeated, &quot;His Majesty the Khalifa, in agreement with allied States, will acquire guarantee for independence of the united state of Pathanistan and will provide every kind of assistance to it. Thereafter, I will not allow any interference in the country of Pathanistan.&quot; (Ahmad Chagharzai; 1989; pp. 138–139). However the efforts failed and the Afghan Amir Habibullah Khan maintained Afghanistan&#x27;s neutrality throughout World War I.

Similarly, during the 1942 Cripps Mission, and 1946 Cabinet Mission to India, the Afghan government made repeated attempts to ensure that any debate about the independence of India must include Afghanistan&#x27;s role in the future of the NWFP. The British government wavered between reassuring the Afghan to the rejection of their role and insistence that NWFP was an integral part of British India.

During World War II, the government of Nazi Germany proposed an alliance with neutral Afghanistan in order to destabilize British control over the north-west of its domain in India. In return, the Afghans sought that NWFP and the Port of Karachi would be ceded to the Kingdom of Afghanistan with German military aid, so that it could gain valuable access to the Arabian Sea. Such a plan would require annexation of NWFP, Baluchistan and Sindh provinces.

The Khudai Khidmatgars (also known as the &quot;Red Shirts&quot;) were members of a civil rights movement. Its leader Bacha Khan claimed to have been inspired by the Indian activist Mahatma Gandhi. While the Red Shirts were willing to work with the Indian National Congress from a political point of view, the Pashtuns living in the NWFP desired independence from India. However, the Bacha Khan wanted the Pashtuns areas in British India to remain part of United India instead of gaining independence.

===Bannu Resolution===

In June 1947, Mirzali Khan (Faqir of Ipi), Bacha Khan, and other Khudai Khidmatgars declared the Bannu Resolution, demanding that the Pashtuns be given a choice to have an independent state of Pashtunistan composing all Pashtun majority territories of British India, instead of being made to join the new state of Pakistan. However, the British Raj refused to comply with the demand of this resolution.
===1947 NWFP referendum ===

The NWFP joined the Dominion of Pakistan as a result of the 1947 NWFP referendum, which had been boycotted by the Khudai Khidmatgar movement, including Bacha Khan and then-chief minister Dr. Khan Sahib, as they were ditched by the leadership of Congress. About (99.02%) of the votes were cast in favor of Pakistan and only 2,874 (0.98%) in favor of India.

===Independence of Pakistan in 1947===
The concept of Pashtunistan has varying meanings across Pakistan and Afghanistan.
In Afghanistan, Pashtun nationalists look after the interests of the Pashtun ethnic group and have support only from them. They favor the ideas of &quot;Lōy Afghānistān&quot; or &quot;Greater Afghanistan&quot;, and maintain an irredentist claim on the entire Pashtun-populated region. The Pashtunistan demand also served the cause of domestic Afghan politics, where several successive governments used the idea to strengthen &quot;Pashtun ethnic support&quot; for the state. This policy intensified ethno-linguistic rivalry between Pashtuns and non-Pashtuns in the country. These claims are contested in Pakistan, where Pashtun politics centers on political autonomy rather than irredentist politics.

Since the late 1940s with the dissolution of British India and independence of Pakistan, some rigid Pashtun nationalists proposed merging with Afghanistan or creating Pashtunistan as a future sovereign state for the local Pashtun inhabitants of the area. At first, Afghanistan became the only government to oppose the entry of Pakistan into the United Nations in 1947, although it was reversed a few months later. On July 26, 1949, when Afghanistan–Pakistan relations were rapidly deteriorating, a loya jirga was held in Afghanistan after a military aircraft from the Pakistan Air Force bombed a village on the Afghan side of the Durand Line. As a result of this violation, the Afghan government declared that it recognized &quot;neither the imaginary Durand nor any similar line&quot; and that all previous Durand Line agreements were void. Bacha Khan when took an oath of allegiance to Pakistan in 1948 in legislation assembly and during his speech he was asked by PM Liaquat Ali Khan about Pashtunistan to which he replied that it&#x27;s just a name to the Pashtun province in Pakistan same like Punjab, Bengal, Sindh and Baluchishtan are the names of provinces of Pakistan as ethno-linguistic names, contrary to what he believed and strived for Pashtunistan an independent state. During the 1950s to the late 1960s, Pashtuns were promoted to higher positions within the Pakistani government and military, thereby integrating Pashtuns into the Pakistani state and severely weakening secessionist sentiments to the point that by the mid-1960s, popular support for an independent Pashtunistan had all but disappeared.
Afghanistan and Pashtun nationalists did not exploit Pakistan&#x27;s vulnerability during the nation&#x27;s 1965 and 1971 wars with India, and even backed Pakistan against a largely Hindu India. Further, had Pakistan been destabilized by India, nationalists would have had to fight against a much bigger country than Pakistan for their independence.

Sardar Daoud Khan, who was the-then prime minister of Afghanistan supported a nationalistic reunification of the Pashtuns in Pakistan with Afghanistan. He wanted Pashtun-dominated areas like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Baloch-dominated areas like Balochistan to become part of Afghanistan. However, his policy of reunification of Pashtuns antagonized Non-Pashtuns like Tajiks, Uzbeks and Hazaras living in Afghanistan. Non-Pashtuns believed that the aim of reunification of Pashtuns areas was to increase the population of Pashtuns in Afghanistan. As a result, Daoud Khan was extremely unpopular with Non-Pashtun Afghans. 
Bacha Khan stated that &quot;Daoud Khan only exploited the idea of reunification of Pashtun people to meet his own political ends&quot;. In 1960 and later in 1961, Daoud Khan made two attempts to capture Bajaur District in Khyber Pakthunkhwa, Pakistan. However, all of Daoud Khan attempts failed as the Afghan army was routed with heavy casualties. Several Afghan army soldiers were also captured by Pakistani soldiers and they were paraded in front of international media which in turn caused embarrassment for Daoud Khan. As a consequence of Daoud Khan&#x27;s actions, Pakistan closed its border with Afghanistan which caused economic crisis in Afghanistan. Because of continued resentment against Daoud&#x27;s autocratic rule, close ties with the Soviet Union and economic downturn caused by the blockade imposed by Pakistan, Daoud Khan was forced to resign by King Zahir Shah. Under King Zahir Shah rule, relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan improved and Pakistan opened its border with Afghanistan. However, later on in 1973, Daoud Khan seized power from King Zahir Shah in a military Coup d&#x27;état and declared himself the first president of Afghanistan. After seizing the power, the Daoud Khan&#x27;s government started proxy war against Pakistan. Daoud Khan&#x27;s government established several training camps for anti-Pakistani militants in Kabul and Kandahar with the aim of training and arming those militants to carry out their activities against Pakistan.
On the other hand, Mirzali Khan and his followers continued their guerilla war against the Pakistani government from their base in Gurwek. In 1960, Afghan Prime Minister Mohammed Daoud Khan sent the Afghan military across the poorly-demarcated Durand Line into the Pakistani Bajaur Agency in order to manipulate events in the region and press the Pashtunistan issue; these plans ultimately came to nothing after the Afghan troops were defeated by Pakistani irregular forces. In support of the quasi-invasion, the Afghan government engaged in an intense propaganda war via radio broadcasts.

Pakistani government decided to retaliate against the Afghan government&#x27;s Pashtunistan policy by supporting Non-Pashtun opponents of the Afghan government including future Mujaheddin leaders like Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and Ahmad Shah Massoud. This operation was remarkably successful, and by 1977 the Afghan government of Daoud Khan was willing to settle all outstanding issues in exchange for a lifting of the ban on the National Awami Party and a commitment towards provincial autonomy for Pashtuns, which was already guaranteed by Pakistan&#x27;s Constitution, but stripped by the Bhutto government when the One Unit scheme was introduced.

Bacha Khan who previously strived greatly for Pashtunistan later on in 1980 during an interview with an Indian journalist, Haroon Siddiqui said that the &quot;idea of Pashtunistan never helped Pashtuns. In fact it was never a reality&quot;. He further said that &quot;successive Afghan governments have exploited the idea for their own political ends&quot;. It was only towards the end of Mohammed Daoud Khan regime that he stopped talking about Pashtunistan. Later on, even Nur Muhammad Taraki also talked about the idea of Pashtunistan and caused trouble for Pakistan. He also said that &quot;Pashtun people greatly suffered because of all this.&quot;

In 1976, the then president of Afghanistan, Sardar Mohammed Daoud Khan recognised Durand Line as international border between Pakistan and Afghanistan. He made this declaration while he was on an official visit to Islamabad, Pakistan.

Daoud would be overthrown by Khalqist military officers in 1978 leading to the formation of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan which was dominated by Pashtun Khalqists who would go on to &quot;reopen the Pashtunistan wound&quot;. In 1979 under General Secretary Nur Muhammad Taraki the Khalqists regime in Afghanistan changed the official map to include NWFP and Balochistan as new &quot;frontier provinces&quot; of the DRA. The Khalqist regime also sought to make Pashto the sole language of the Afghan government and the lingua franca, they did so by undermining Dari. The Afghan anthem under the communist regime was only in Pashto and not Dari with non-Pashtuns being required to sing it in Pashto. Up until the overthrow of Dr Najibullah&#x27;s Homeland Party regime in 1992, Afghan governments had favored Pashto in the media and over 50% of Afghan media was in Pashto. After 1992 with the formation of the Tajik led Islamic State of Afghanistan, this number dropped drastically.

Following the outbreak of the Soviet-Afghan War in Afghanistan, millions of Afghans including non-Pashtun people fled to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.

==20th and 21st century==

Pashtuns in Pakistan make up the second largest ethnic group after Punjabis with about 16% of the population, totaling over 30 million. This figure only includes the native Pashto speaking inhabitants of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Northern Balochistan, and does not include the Pathans settled in Punjab and Sindh who make up significant numbers alongside the native communities of these two provinces. In addition, there are 1.7 million Afghan refugees of whom majority are Pashtuns. These refugees, however, are expected to leave Pakistan and settle in Afghanistan in the coming years. Three Pakistani presidents belonged to the Pashtun ethnic group. Pashtuns continue to occupy important places in the military and politics, with the former Prime Minister of Pakistan Imran Khan who leads Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and &quot;Awami National Party&quot; led by Asfandyar Wali . In addition to this, some Pashtun media, music and cultural activities are based out of Pakistan, with AVT Khyber being a Pashto TV channel in Pakistan. Pashto cinema is based out of the Pakistani city of Peshawar. The Pakistani city of Karachi is believed to host the largest concentration of Pashtuns.

There are more than 19 million Pashtuns in Afghanistan, constituting 48% of the population. Other sources say that up to 60% of Afghanistan&#x27;s population is made up of ethnic Pashtuns, forming the largest ethnic group in that country. Pashto is one of the official languages of Afghanistan, the Afghan National Anthem is recited in Pashto language and the Pashtun dress is the national dress of Afghanistan. Since the late 19th century, the traditional Pashtunistan region has gradually expanded to the Amu River in the north. However, most Pashtun living in north of the Helmand River tend to speak Dari instead of Pashto.

Important government positions in Afghanistan have historically been held by Pashtuns. The Afghan Armed Forces was also traditionally dominated by Pashtuns however the fall of the Najibullah regime in 1992 led to the creation of the Tajik dominated Islamic State of Afghanistan.

The majority of the Afghan Taliban are ethnic Pashtuns, with past Pashtun leaders such as Mullah Mohammed Omar, Mohammad Rabbani and Jalaluddin Haqqani. The current leaders of the Taliban include Pashtuns such as Abdul Kabir, Hibatullah Akhundzada and Sirajuddin Haqqani.

Afghanistan makes its claim on the Pashtun areas on the ground that it served as the Pashtun seat of power since 1709 with the rise of the Hotaki dynasty followed by the establishment of the Durrani Afghan Empire. According to historic sources, Afghan tribes did not appear in Peshawar valley until after 800 AD, when the Islamic conquest of this area took place.

Agreements cited by the Afghan government as proof of their claim over the Pashtun tribes include Article 11 of the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1921, which states: &quot;The two contracting parties, being mutually satisfied themselves each regarding the goodwill of the other and especially regarding their benevolent intentions towards the tribes residing close to their respective boundaries, hereby undertake to inform each other of any future military operations which may appear necessary for the maintenance of order among the frontier tribes residing within their respective spheres before the commencement of such operations.&quot; A supplementary letter to the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1921 reads: &quot;As the conditions of the Frontier tribes of the two governments are of interest to the Government of Afghanistan. I inform you that the British government entertains feelings of goodwill towards all the Frontier tribes and has every intention of treating them generously, provided they abstain from outrages against the people of India.&quot;

===Khyber Pakhtunkhwa===

Prominent 20th century proponents of the Pashtunistan cause have included Khan Abdul Wali Khan and Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan. Ghaffar Khan stated in the Pakistan Constituent Assembly in 1948 that he simply wanted &quot;the renaming of his province as Pashtunistan same like Punjab, Sindh and Baluchishtan are the names of provinces of Pakistan as ethno-linguistic names, Another name mentioned is Afghania where the initial &quot;A&quot; in Choudhary Rahmat Ali Khan&#x27;s theory stated in the &quot;Now or Never&quot; pamphlet stands for the second letter in &quot;Pakistan&quot;. However, this name has failed to capture political support in the province.

There was support, however, to rename North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) as Pakhtunkhwa (which translates as &quot;area of Pashtuns&quot;). Nasim Wali Khan (the wife of Khan Abdul Wali Khan) declared in an interview: &quot;I want an identity. I want the name to change so that Pathans may be identified on the map of Pakistan...&quot;

On 31 March 2010, Pakistan&#x27;s Constitutional Reform Committee agreed that the province be named and recognized as Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa. This is now the official name for the former NWFP.

<text>Reginald Bretnor (born Alfred Reginald Kahn; July 30, 1911 – July 22, 1992) was an American science fiction author who flourished between the 1950s and 1980s. Most of his fiction was in short story form, and usually featured a whimsical story line or ironic plot twist. He also wrote on military theory and public affairs, and edited some of the earliest books to consider SF from a literary theory and criticism perspective.

Bretnor&#x27;s father, Grigory Kahn, was a Russian Jew, but he and his family left Siberia for Japan in 1917 and later settled in the United States. Bretnor&#x27;s mother was born a British subject, became a Russian subject, spent from 1917 to 1920 in Japan, then settled in the United States with her children Reginald and Margaret. Reginald Bretnor himself was born in Vladivostok, Russia. He was married to Helen Harding, a translator and U.C. Berkeley librarian, from 1948 until her death in 1967. He subsequently married Rosalie, whom he referred to in a letter in the Southern Oregon Historical Society Archives as Rosalie McShane, although she wrote under the name Rosalie Bodrero.

According to papers in the SOHS Archives, Bretnor&#x27;s military background included service in the last cavalry unit in the U.S. Army. Health issues led to his discharge in August 1941. He tried to reenlist in 1942, but was rejected. He was hired by the Office of War Information to write propaganda to be sent to Japan, and papers related to his work are held in the SOHS Archives. After World War II, Bretnor worked for the U.S. State Department until ill health once again caused him to resign. He died, aged 80, in Medford, Oregon.
In addition to wars, weaponry and science fiction, Bretnor&#x27;s interests included cats. He translated &quot;Les Chats&quot;, the first known book about cats, written by François-Augustin de Paradis de Moncrif in 1727. He also wrote multiple articles about cats, always owned cats, and considered himself to have a psychic connection to cats.

It has been alleged that Bretnor was an early associate of Anton Szandor LaVey in the days before the founding of the Church of Satan, and that Bretnor and other science fiction authors were members of LaVey&#x27;s &quot;Order of the Trapezoid&quot; in the early 1950s.

===Ferdinand Feghoot series===

Under the pseudonym Grendel Briarton (an anagram of Reginald Bretnor), he published a series of over eighty science-fiction themed shaggy-dog vignettes featuring the time-traveling hero Ferdinand Feghoot. Known as &quot;Feghoots&quot;, the stories involved Feghoot resolving a situation encountered while traveling through time and space (à la Doctor Who) with a bad pun. In one example, he explained his inability to pay his dues for a Sherlock Holmes fan society by turning out his empty pockets and declaring &quot;share lack&quot;. In his adventures, Feghoot worked for the Society for the Aesthetic Re-Arrangement of History and traveled via a device that had no name but was typographically represented as the &quot;)(&quot;. In 1980, &quot;The Compleat Feghoot&quot; collected all of Bretnor&#x27;s Feghoots published up to that time and included a selection of winners and honorable mentions from a contest run by &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;. The book is, as of 2006, out of print and very rare.

===Non-fiction===

Reginald Bretnor invited leading SF authors and science writers to participate in virtual &quot;symposiums&quot; by contributing essays (to fill Bretnor&#x27;s own table of contents) discussing the science fiction genre.

* &quot;Science Fiction Today and Tomorrow: A Discursive Symposium&quot; (1975, with Frederik Pohl, Poul Anderson, Jack Williamson, Ray Bradbury, Hal Clement, Isaac Asimov, Frank Herbert, Hugo Gernsback, Theodore Sturgeon, A. E. van Vogt, Cory Panshin, Larry Niven, James Blish, Harlan Ellison, E. E. Smith)
* &quot;The Craft of Science Fiction: A Symposium on Writing Science Fiction and Science Fantasy&quot; (1976, with Robert A. Heinlein, Frederik Pohl, Larry Niven, Poul Anderson, Harlan Ellison, Hal Clement, A. E. van Vogt, Frank Herbert, Jerry Pournelle, Isaac Asimov, Jack Williamson, Norman Spinrad)
* &quot;Modern Science Fiction: Its Meaning and Its Future&quot; (1953, second edition 1979, with John W. Campbell, Jr., Anthony Boucher, Fletcher Pratt, L. Sprague de Camp, Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, Philip Wylie, Gerald Heard)

In 1969, Bretnor published a book on warfare titled &quot;Decisive Warfare: A Study in Military Theory&quot;. Largely unnoticed by his science fiction readership but hinted at by his &quot;Future at War&quot; series, it proved him a scholar of varied talents.

The collection &quot;Of Force and Violence and Other Imponderables: Essays on War, Politics, and Government&quot; was published in 1992.

Bretnor also wrote nonfiction articles for the survivalist newsletter &quot;P.S. Letter&quot;, edited by Mel Tappan.

<text>&quot;Genius of the Species&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Reginald Bretnor (first published with the author name &quot;R. Bretnor&quot;), which originally appeared in the anthology &quot;9 Tales of Space and Time&quot; edited by Raymond Healy.

The story is set in the Soviet Union where a rat problem is getting out of control due to the laziness of cats. This problem is solved by a government program to use artificial means to raise the intelligence of cats to an IQ of 20.2 so that they can be taught Marxism and subsequently realize catching rats is for the greater good. However, due to a calculation error on part of the scientist responsible for this program, the cats end up with an IQ of 202 rather than 20.2. With this superior intellect cats become the dominant species in the Communist world.

<text>In geometry, a pseudosphere is a surface with constant negative Gaussian curvature.

A pseudosphere of radius is a surface in formula_1 having curvature −1/&quot;R&quot;2 at each point. Its name comes from the analogy with the sphere of radius , which is a surface of curvature 1/&quot;R&quot;2. The term was introduced by Eugenio Beltrami in his 1868 paper on models of hyperbolic geometry.

== Tractroid ==

The same surface can be also described as the result of revolving a tractrix about its asymptote.
For this reason the pseudosphere is also called tractroid. As an example, the (half) pseudosphere (with radius 1) is the surface of revolution of the tractrix parametrized by
:formula_2

It is a singular space (the equator is a singularity), but away from the singularities, it has constant negative Gaussian curvature and therefore is locally isometric to a hyperbolic plane.

The name &quot;pseudosphere&quot; comes about because it has a two-dimensional surface of constant negative Gaussian curvature, just as a sphere has a surface with constant positive Gaussian curvature.
Just as the sphere has at every point a positively curved geometry of a dome the whole pseudosphere has at every point the negatively curved geometry of a saddle.

As early as 1693 Christiaan Huygens found that the volume and the surface area of the pseudosphere are finite, despite the infinite extent of the shape along the axis of rotation. For a given edge radius , the area is just as it is for the sphere, while the volume is and therefore half that of a sphere of that radius.

The pseudosphere is an important geometric precursor to mathematical fabric arts and pedagogy.

== Universal covering space ==

The half pseudosphere of curvature −1 is covered by the interior of a horocycle. In the Poincaré half-plane model one convenient choice is the portion of the half-plane with . Then the covering map is periodic in the direction of period 2, and takes the horocycles to the meridians of the pseudosphere and the vertical geodesics to the tractrices that generate the pseudosphere. This mapping is a local isometry, and thus exhibits the portion of the upper half-plane as the universal covering space of the pseudosphere. The precise mapping is
:formula_3
where
:formula_4
is the parametrization of the tractrix above.

== Hyperboloid ==

In some sources that use the hyperboloid model of the hyperbolic plane, the hyperboloid is referred to as a pseudosphere.
This usage of the word is because the hyperboloid can be thought of as a sphere of imaginary radius, embedded in a Minkowski space.

== Pseudospherical surfaces ==
A pseudospherical surface is a generalization of the pseudosphere. A surface which is piecewise smoothly immersed in formula_1 with constant negative curvature is a pseudospherical surface. The tractroid is the simplest example. Other examples include the Dini&#x27;s surfaces, breather surfaces, and the Kuen surface.

== Relation to solutions to the sine-Gordon equation ==
Pseudospherical surfaces can be constructed from solutions to the sine-Gordon equation. A sketch proof starts with reparametrizing the tractroid with coordinates in which the Gauss–Codazzi equations can be rewritten as the sine-Gordon equation. 

In particular, for the tractroid the Gauss–Codazzi equations are the sine-Gordon equation applied to the static soliton solution, so the Gauss–Codazzi equations are satisfied. In these coordinates the first and second fundamental forms are written in a way that makes clear the Gaussian curvature is −1 for any solution of the sine-Gordon equations.

Then any solution to the sine-Gordon equation can be used to specify a first and second fundamental form which satisfy the Gauss–Codazzi equations. There is then a theorem that any such set of initial data can be used to at least locally specify an immersed surface in formula_1.

A few examples of sine-Gordon solutions and their corresponding surface are given as follows:
* Static 1-soliton: pseudosphere
* Moving 1-soliton: Dini&#x27;s surface
* Breather solution: Breather surface
* 2-soliton: Kuen surface

<text>Gemology or gemmology is the science dealing with natural and artificial gemstone materials. It is a specific interdisciplinary branch of mineralogy. Some jewelers (and many non-jewelers) are academically trained gemologists and are qualified to identify and evaluate gems.

==History==
Rudimentary education in gemology for jewellers and gemologists began in the nineteenth century, but the first qualifications were instigated after the National Association of Goldsmiths of Great Britain (NAG) set up as an Education Committee for this purpose in 1908. The committee emerged as a distinct branch of NAG (named the Gemmological Association) in 1931, shortly after the incorporation of the Gemological Institute of America (GIA). In 1938 the branch was renamed as the Gemmological Association of Great Britain, before being incorporated in 1847. The organisation is now an educational charity and accredited awarding body with its courses taught worldwide.

The first US graduate of Gem-A&#x27;s diploma course, in 1929, was Robert Shipley, who then established both the Gemological Institute of America and the American Gem Society. There are now several professional schools and associations of gemologists and certification programs around the world.

The first gemological laboratory serving the jewelry trade was established in London in 1925, prompted by the influx of the newly developed &quot;cultured pearl&quot; and advances in the synthesis of rubies and sapphires. There are now numerous gem laboratories around the world requiring ever more advanced equipment and experience to identify the new challenges – such as treatments to gems, new synthetics, and other new materials.

==Background==
It is often difficult to obtain an expert judgement from a neutral laboratory. Analysis and estimation in the gemstone trade usually have to take place on site. Professional gemologists and gemstone buyers use mobile laboratories, which pool all necessary instruments in a travel case. Such so-called travel labs even have their own current supply, which makes them independent from infrastructure. They are also suitable for gemological expeditions.

Gemstones are basically categorized based on their crystal structure, specific gravity, refractive index, and other optical properties, such as pleochroism. The physical property of &quot;hardness&quot; is defined by the irregular Mohs scale of mineral hardness.

Gemologists study these factors while valuing or appraising cut and polished gemstones. Gemological microscopic study of the internal structure is used to determine whether a gem is synthetic or natural by revealing natural fluid inclusions or partially melted exogenous crystals that are evidence of heat treatment to enhance color.

The spectroscopic analysis of cut gemstones also allows a gemologist to understand the atomic structure and identify its origin, which is a major factor in valuing a gemstone. For example, a ruby from Myanmar (Burma) will have definite internal and optical activity variance from a Thai ruby.

When the gemstones are in a rough state, the gemologist studies the external structure; the host rock and mineral association; and natural and polished color. Initially, the stone is identified by its color, refractive index, optical character, specific gravity, and examination of internal characteristics under magnification.
==Gemological instruments==
Gemologists use a variety of tools and equipment which allow for the accurate tests to be performed in order to identify a gemstone by its specific characteristics and properties.
These include:
* Corrected 10× loupe 
* Microscope
* Refractometer
** Polarising filter
** Magnifying eyepiece 
** Contact liquid for RI (refractive index) up to 1.81
* Polariscope
** Optic figure sphere
* Dichroscope 
* Spectroscope (handheld or desktop)
* Penlight
* Tweezers 
* Stone cloth 
* Color filter
* Immersion cell
* Ultraviolet lamp

==General identification of gems==

Gem identification is basically a process of elimination. Gemstones of similar color undergo non-destructive optical testing until there is only one possible identity.

Any single test is nearly always only indicative. For example: The specific gravity of ruby is 4.00, glass is 3.15–4.20, and cubic zirconia is 5.6–5.9 . So one can easily tell the difference between cubic zirconia and the other two; however, there is overlap between ruby and glass.

As with all naturally occurring materials, no two gems are identical. The geological environment they are created in influences the overall process so that although the basics can be identified, the presence of chemical &quot;impurities&quot;, and substitutions along with structural imperfections create &quot;individuals&quot;.

===Identification by refractive index===

One test to determine the gem&#x27;s identity is to measure the refraction of light in the gem. Essentially, when light passes from one medium to another, it bends. Blue light bends more than red light. How much the light bends will vary depending on the gem mineral.

Every material has a critical angle, above which point light is reflected back internally. This can be measured and thus used to determine the gem&#x27;s identity. Typically this is measured using a refractometer, although it is possible to measure it using a microscope.

===Identification by specific gravity===
Specific gravity, also known as relative density, varies depending upon the chemical composition and crystal structure type. Heavy liquids with a known specific gravity are used to test loose gemstones.

Specific gravity is measured by comparing the weight of the gem in air with the weight of the gem suspended in water.

===Identification by spectroscopy===
This method uses a similar principle to how a prism works to separate white light into its component colors. A gemological spectroscope is employed to analyze the selective absorption of light in the gem material. Coloring agents or chromophores show bands in the spectroscope and indicate which element is responsible for the gem&#x27;s color.

=== Identification by inclusions ===

Inclusions can help gemologists to determine whether or not a gemstone is natural, synthetic or treated (i.e. fracture-filled or heated).
=== Identification by flaws and striations ===

During the Verneuil process for synthesizing gems, a fine crushed material is heated at extremely high temperatures. The powdered gem mineral is then melted (or a metallic mixture directly burned in an oxygen flame) the residue of which then drips through a furnace onto a boule. The boule where the corundum or spinel cools down and crystallizes, spins and thus causes the curved striations, which are diagnostic for a lab-created gem: Natural corundum does not show curved striations.

Likewise, natural stones, particularly beryl minerals, show small flaws – short planar cracks where the direction of the crystalline orientation in the gem abruptly changes. The natural formation of gemstones tends to layer the minerals in regular crystalline sheets, whereas many synthetically produced gems have an amorphous structure, like glass. Synthetics made by the Verneuil process either do not show flaws at all, or if any flaws are present, show curvy, undulating surfaces rather than flat ones.

<doc id="60770" wikidata="Q214881" url="?curid=60770" title="Curvature">
<text>In mathematics, curvature is any of several strongly related concepts in geometry that intuitively measure the amount by which a curve deviates from being a straight line or by which a surface deviates from being a plane. If a curve or surface is contained in a larger space, curvature can be defined &quot;extrinsically&quot; relative to the ambient space. Curvature of Riemannian manifolds of dimension at least two can be defined &quot;intrinsically&quot; without reference to a larger space.

For curves, the canonical example is that of a circle, which has a curvature equal to the reciprocal of its radius. Smaller circles bend more sharply, and hence have higher curvature. The curvature &quot;at a point&quot; of a differentiable curve is the curvature of its osculating circle — that is, the circle that best approximates the curve near this point. The curvature of a straight line is zero. In contrast to the tangent, which is a vector quantity, the curvature at a point is typically a scalar quantity, that is, it is expressed by a single real number.

For surfaces (and, more generally for higher-dimensional manifolds), that are embedded in a Euclidean space, the concept of curvature is more complex, as it depends on the choice of a direction on the surface or manifold. This leads to the concepts of &quot;maximal curvature&quot;, &quot;minimal curvature&quot;, and &quot;mean curvature&quot;.

==History==

In &quot;Tractatus de configurationibus qualitatum et motuum,&quot; the 14th-century philosopher and mathematician Nicole Oresme introduces the concept of curvature as a measure of departure from straightness; for circles he has the curvature as being inversely proportional to the radius; and he attempts to extend this idea to other curves as a continuously varying magnitude.

The curvature of a differentiable curve was originally defined through osculating circles. In this setting, Augustin-Louis Cauchy showed that the center of curvature is the intersection point of two infinitely close normal lines to the curve. 

==Plane curves==
Intuitively, the curvature describes for any part of a curve how much the curve direction changes over a small distance travelled (e.g. angle in ), so it is a measure of the instantaneous rate of change of &quot;direction&quot; of a point that moves on the curve: the larger the curvature, the larger this rate of change. In other words, the curvature measures how fast the unit tangent vector to the curve at point p rotates when point p moves at unit speed along the curve. In fact, it can be proved that this instantaneous rate of change is exactly the curvature. More precisely, suppose that the point is moving on the curve at a constant speed of one unit, that is, the position of the point is a function of the parameter , which may be thought as the time or as the arc length from a given origin. Let be a unit tangent vector of the curve at , which is also the derivative of with respect to . Then, the derivative of with respect to is a vector that is normal to the curve and whose length is the curvature.

To be meaningful, the definition of the curvature and its different characterizations require that the curve is continuously differentiable near , for having a tangent that varies continuously; it requires also that the curve is twice differentiable at , for insuring the existence of the involved limits, and of the derivative of .

The characterization of the curvature in terms of the derivative of the unit tangent vector is probably less intuitive than the definition in terms of the osculating circle, but formulas for computing the curvature are easier to deduce. Therefore, and also because of its use in kinematics, this characterization is often given as a definition of the curvature.

===Osculating circle===

Historically, the curvature of a differentiable curve was defined through the osculating circle, which is the circle that best approximates the curve at a point. More precisely, given a point on a curve, every other point of the curve defines a circle (or sometimes a line) passing through and tangent to the curve at . The osculating circle is the limit, if it exists, of this circle when tends to . Then the &quot;center&quot; and the &quot;radius of curvature&quot; of the curve at are the center and the radius of the osculating circle. The curvature is the reciprocal of radius of curvature. That is, the curvature is 
: formula_1
where is the radius of curvature (the whole circle has this curvature, it can be read as turn over the length ).

This definition is difficult to manipulate and to express in formulas. Therefore, other equivalent definitions have been introduced.

===In terms of arc-length parametrization===
Every differentiable curve can be parametrized with respect to arc length. In the case of a plane curve, this means the existence of a parametrization , where and are real-valued differentiable functions whose derivatives satisfy
:formula_2
This means that the tangent vector
:formula_3
has a length equal to one and is thus a unit tangent vector.

If the curve is twice differentiable, that is, if the second derivatives of and exist, then the derivative of exists. This vector is normal to the curve, its length is the curvature , and it is oriented toward the center of curvature. That is,
:formula_4

Moreover, because the radius of curvature is (assuming &quot;𝜿&quot;(&quot;s&quot;) ≠ 0)
:formula_5
and the center of curvature is on the normal to the curve, the center of curvature is the point 
:formula_6 

(In case the curvature is zero, the center of curvature is not located anywhere on the plane R2 and is often said to be located &quot;at infinity&quot;.)
If is the unit normal vector obtained from by a counterclockwise rotation of , then 
:formula_7
with . The real number is called the oriented curvature or signed curvature. It depends on both the orientation of the plane (definition of counterclockwise), and the orientation of the curve provided by the parametrization. In fact, the change of variable provides another arc-length parametrization, and changes the sign of .

=== In terms of a general parametrization ===
Let be a proper parametric representation of a twice differentiable plane curve. Here &quot;proper&quot; means that on the domain of definition of the parametrization, the derivative 
is defined, differentiable and nowhere equal to the zero vector.

With such a parametrization, the signed curvature is 
:formula_8
where primes refer to derivatives with respect to . The curvature is thus
:formula_9

These can be expressed in a coordinate-free way as
:formula_10

These formulas can be derived from the special case of arc-length parametrization in the following way. The above condition on the parametrisation imply that the arc length is a differentiable monotonic function of the parameter , and conversely that is a monotonic function of . Moreover, by changing, if needed, to , one may suppose that these functions are increasing and have a positive derivative. Using notation of the preceding section and the chain rule, one has 
:formula_11
and thus, by taking the norm of both sides 
:formula_12
where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to .

The curvature is the norm of the derivative of with respect to . By using the above formula and the chain rule this derivative and its norm can be expressed in terms of and only, with the arc-length parameter completely eliminated, giving the above formulas for the curvature.

===Graph of a function===
The graph of a function , is a special case of a parametrized curve, of the form
:formula_13
As the first and second derivatives of are 1 and 0, previous formulas simplify to 
:formula_14
for the curvature, and to
:formula_15
for the signed curvature.

In the general case of a curve, the sign of the signed curvature is somewhat arbitrary, as it depends on the orientation of the curve. In the case of the graph of a function, there is a natural orientation by increasing values of . This makes significant the sign of the signed curvature.

The sign of the signed curvature is the same as the sign of the second derivative of . If it is positive then the graph has an upward concavity, and, if it is negative the graph has a downward concavity. If it is zero, then one has an inflection point or an undulation point.

When the slope of the graph (that is the derivative of the function) is small, the signed curvature is well approximated by the second derivative. More precisely, using big O notation, one has 
:formula_16
It is common in physics and engineering to approximate the curvature with the second derivative, for example, in beam theory or for deriving the wave equation of a string under tension, and other applications where small slopes are involved. This often allows systems that are otherwise nonlinear to be treated approximately as linear.

===Polar coordinates===

If a curve is defined in polar coordinates by the radius expressed as a function of the polar angle, that is is a function of , then its curvature is
:formula_17
where the prime refers to differentiation with respect to .

This results from the formula for general parametrizations, by considering the parametrization 
:formula_18

=== Implicit curve ===

For a curve defined by an implicit equation with partial derivatives denoted , , , , ,
the curvature is given by
:formula_19

The signed curvature is not defined, as it depends on an orientation of the curve that is not provided by the implicit equation. Note that changing into would not change the curve defined by , but it would change the sign of the numerator if the absolute value were omitted in the preceding formula.

A point of the curve where is a singular point, which means that the curve is not differentiable at this point, and thus that the curvature is not defined (most often, the point is either a crossing point or a cusp).

The above formula for the curvature can be derived from the expression of the curvature of the graph of a function by using the implicit function theorem and the fact that, on such a curve, one has 
:formula_20

=== Examples ===
It can be useful to verify on simple examples that the different formulas given in the preceding sections give the same result.

====Circle====
A common parametrization of a circle of radius is . The formula for the curvature gives
:formula_21

It follows, as expected, that the radius of curvature is the radius of the circle, and that the center of curvature is the center of the circle.

The circle is a rare case where the arc-length parametrization is easy to compute, as it is
:formula_22
It is an arc-length parametrization, since the norm of
:formula_23
is equal to one. This parametrization gives the same value for the curvature, as it amounts to division by in both the numerator and the denominator in the preceding formula.

The same circle can also be defined by the implicit equation with . Then, the formula for the curvature in this case gives
:formula_24

====Parabola====
Consider the parabola .

It is the graph of a function, with derivative , and second derivative . So, the signed curvature is 
:formula_25
It has the sign of for all values of . This means that, if , the concavity is upward directed everywhere; if , the concavity is downward directed; for , the curvature is zero everywhere, confirming that the parabola degenerates into a line in this case.

The (unsigned) curvature is maximal for , that is at the stationary point (zero derivative) of the function, which is the vertex of the parabola.

Consider the parametrization . The first derivative of is , and the second derivative is zero. Substituting into the formula for general parametrizations gives exactly the same result as above, with replaced by . If we use primes for derivatives with respect to the parameter .

The same parabola can also be defined by the implicit equation with . As , and , one obtains exactly the same value for the (unsigned) curvature. However, the signed curvature is meaningless here, as is a valid implicit equation for the same parabola, which gives the opposite sign for the curvature.

===Frenet–Serret formulas for plane curves===

The expression of the curvature In terms of arc-length parametrization is essentially the first Frenet–Serret formula
:formula_26
where the primes refer to the derivatives with respect to the arc length , and is the normal unit vector in the direction of .

As planar curves have zero torsion, the second Frenet–Serret formula provides the relation
:formula_27

For a general parametrization by a parameter , one needs expressions involving derivatives with respect to . As these are obtained by multiplying by the derivatives with respect to , one has, for any proper parametrization
:formula_28

===Curvature comb===

A &quot;curvature comb&quot; can be used to represent graphically the curvature of every point on a curve. If formula_29 is a parametrised curve its comb is defined as the parametrized curve
:formula_30
where formula_31 are the curvature and normal vector and formula_32 is a scaling factor (to be chosen as to enhance the graphical representation).

==Space curves==

As in the case of curves in two dimensions, the curvature of a regular space curve in three dimensions (and higher) is the magnitude of the acceleration of a particle moving with unit speed along a curve. Thus if is the arc-length parametrization of then the unit tangent vector is given by
:formula_33
and the curvature is the magnitude of the acceleration:
:formula_34
The direction of the acceleration is the unit normal vector , which is defined by
:formula_35

The plane containing the two vectors and is the osculating plane to the curve at . The curvature has the following geometrical interpretation. There exists a circle in the osculating plane tangent to whose Taylor series to second order at the point of contact agrees with that of . This is the osculating circle to the curve. The radius of the circle is called the radius of curvature, and the curvature is the reciprocal of the radius of curvature:

:formula_36

The tangent, curvature, and normal vector together describe the second-order behavior of a curve near a point. In three dimensions, the third-order behavior of a curve is described by a related notion of torsion, which measures the extent to which a curve tends to move as a helical path in space. The torsion and curvature are related by the Frenet–Serret formulas (in three dimensions) and their generalization (in higher dimensions).

===General expressions===
For a parametrically-defined space curve in three dimensions given in Cartesian coordinates by , the curvature is

:formula_37

where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to the parameter . This can be expressed independently of the coordinate system by means of the formula

:formula_38

where × denotes the vector cross product. The following formula is valid for the curvature of curves in a Euclidean space of any dimension:

:formula_39

===Curvature from arc and chord length===
Given two points and on , let be the arc length of the portion of the curve between and and let denote the length of the line segment from to . The curvature of at is given by the limit

:formula_40

where the limit is taken as the point approaches on . The denominator can equally well be taken to be . The formula is valid in any dimension. Furthermore, by considering the limit independently on either side of , this definition of the curvature can sometimes accommodate a singularity at . The formula follows by verifying it for the osculating circle.

==Surfaces==

The curvature of curves drawn on a surface is the main tool for the defining and studying the curvature of the surface.

=== Curves on surfaces===
For a curve drawn on a surface (embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space), several curvatures are defined, which relates the direction of curvature to the surface&#x27;s unit normal vector, including the:
* normal curvature
*geodesic curvature 
*geodesic torsion 
Any non-singular curve on a smooth surface has its tangent vector contained in the tangent plane of the surface. The normal curvature, , is the curvature of the curve projected onto the plane containing the curve&#x27;s tangent and the surface normal ; the geodesic curvature, , is the curvature of the curve projected onto the surface&#x27;s tangent plane; and the geodesic torsion (or relative torsion), , measures the rate of change of the surface normal around the curve&#x27;s tangent.

Let the curve be arc-length parametrized, and let so that form an orthonormal basis, called the Darboux frame. The above quantities are related by:
:formula_41

====Principal curvature====
All curves on the surface with the same tangent vector at a given point will have the same normal curvature, which is the same as the curvature of the curve obtained by intersecting the surface with the plane containing and . Taking all possible tangent vectors, the maximum and minimum values of the normal curvature at a point are called the principal curvatures, and , and the directions of the corresponding tangent vectors are called principal normal directions.

===Normal sections===
Curvature can be evaluated along surface normal sections, similar to above (see for example the Earth radius of curvature).

===Developable surfaces===
Some curved surfaces, such as those made from a smooth sheet of paper, can be flattened down into the plane without distorting their intrinsic features in any way. Such developable surfaces have zero Gaussian curvature (see below).

===Gaussian curvature===

In contrast to curves, which do not have intrinsic curvature, but do have extrinsic curvature (they only have a curvature given an embedding), surfaces can have intrinsic curvature, independent of an embedding. The Gaussian curvature, named after Carl Friedrich Gauss, is equal to the product of the principal curvatures, . It has a dimension of length−2 and is positive for spheres, negative for one-sheet hyperboloids and zero for planes and cylinders. It determines whether a surface is locally convex (when it is positive) or locally saddle-shaped (when it is negative).

Gaussian curvature is an &quot;intrinsic&quot; property of the surface, meaning it does not depend on the particular embedding of the surface; intuitively, this means that ants living on the surface could determine the Gaussian curvature. For example, an ant living on a sphere could measure the sum of the interior angles of a triangle and determine that it was greater than 180 degrees, implying that the space it inhabited had positive curvature. On the other hand, an ant living on a cylinder would not detect any such departure from Euclidean geometry; in particular the ant could not detect that the two surfaces have different mean curvatures (see below), which is a purely extrinsic type of curvature.

Formally, Gaussian curvature only depends on the Riemannian metric of the surface. This is Gauss&#x27;s celebrated Theorema Egregium, which he found while concerned with geographic surveys and mapmaking.

An intrinsic definition of the Gaussian curvature at a point is the following: imagine an ant which is tied to with a short thread of length . It runs around while the thread is completely stretched and measures the length of one complete trip around . If the surface were flat, the ant would find . On curved surfaces, the formula for will be different, and the Gaussian curvature at the point can be computed by the Bertrand–Diguet–Puiseux theorem as

:formula_42

The integral of the Gaussian curvature over the whole surface is closely related to the surface&#x27;s Euler characteristic; see the Gauss–Bonnet theorem.

The discrete analog of curvature, corresponding to curvature being concentrated at a point and particularly useful for polyhedra, is the (angular) defect; the analog for the Gauss–Bonnet theorem is Descartes&#x27; theorem on total angular defect.

Because (Gaussian) curvature can be defined without reference to an embedding space, it is not necessary that a surface be embedded in a higher-dimensional space in order to be curved. Such an intrinsically curved two-dimensional surface is a simple example of a Riemannian manifold.

===Mean curvature===

The mean curvature is an &quot;extrinsic&quot; measure of curvature equal to half the sum of the principal curvatures, . It has a dimension of length−1. Mean curvature is closely related to the first variation of surface area. In particular, a minimal surface such as a soap film has mean curvature zero and a soap bubble has constant mean curvature. Unlike Gauss curvature, the mean curvature is extrinsic and depends on the embedding, for instance, a cylinder and a plane are locally isometric but the mean curvature of a plane is zero while that of a cylinder is nonzero.

=== Second fundamental form ===
The intrinsic and extrinsic curvature of a surface can be combined in the second fundamental form. This is a quadratic form in the tangent plane to the surface at a point whose value at a particular tangent vector to the surface is the normal component of the acceleration of a curve along the surface tangent to ; that is, it is the normal curvature to a curve tangent to (see above). Symbolically,
:formula_43
where is the unit normal to the surface. For unit tangent vectors , the second fundamental form assumes the maximum value and minimum value , which occur in the principal directions and , respectively. Thus, by the principal axis theorem, the second fundamental form is
:formula_44
Thus the second fundamental form encodes both the intrinsic and extrinsic curvatures.

=== Shape operator ===

An encapsulation of surface curvature can be found in the shape operator, , which is a self-adjoint linear operator from the tangent plane to itself (specifically, the differential of the Gauss map).

For a surface with tangent vectors and normal , the shape operator can be expressed compactly in index summation notation as

:formula_45
(Compare the alternative expression of curvature for a plane curve.)

The Weingarten equations give the value of in terms of the coefficients of the first and second fundamental forms as
:formula_46
The principal curvatures are the eigenvalues of the shape operator, the principal curvature directions are its eigenvectors, the Gauss curvature is its determinant, and the mean curvature is half its trace.

==Curvature of space==

By extension of the former argument, a space of three or more dimensions can be intrinsically curved. The curvature is &quot;intrinsic&quot; in the sense that it is a property defined at every point in the space, rather than a property defined with respect to a larger space that contains it. In general, a curved space may or may not be conceived as being embedded in a higher-dimensional ambient space; if not then its curvature can only be defined intrinsically.

After the discovery of the intrinsic definition of curvature, which is closely connected with non-Euclidean geometry, many mathematicians and scientists questioned whether ordinary physical space might be curved, although the success of Euclidean geometry up to that time meant that the radius of curvature must be astronomically large. In the theory of general relativity, which describes gravity and cosmology, the idea is slightly generalised to the &quot;curvature of spacetime&quot;; in relativity theory spacetime is a pseudo-Riemannian manifold. Once a time coordinate is defined, the three-dimensional space corresponding to a particular time is generally a curved Riemannian manifold; but since the time coordinate choice is largely arbitrary, it is the underlying spacetime curvature that is physically significant.

Although an arbitrarily curved space is very complex to describe, the curvature of a space which is locally isotropic and homogeneous is described by a single Gaussian curvature, as for a surface; mathematically these are strong conditions, but they correspond to reasonable physical assumptions (all points and all directions are indistinguishable). A positive curvature corresponds to the inverse square radius of curvature; an example is a sphere or hypersphere. An example of negatively curved space is hyperbolic geometry (see also: non-positive curvature). A space or space-time with zero curvature is called flat. For example, Euclidean space is an example of a flat space, and Minkowski space is an example of a flat spacetime. There are other examples of flat geometries in both settings, though. A torus or a cylinder can both be given flat metrics, but differ in their topology. Other topologies are also possible for curved space .

==Generalizations==

The mathematical notion of &quot;curvature&quot; is also defined in much more general contexts. Many of these generalizations emphasize different aspects of the curvature as it is understood in lower dimensions.

One such generalization is kinematic. The curvature of a curve can naturally be considered as a kinematic quantity, representing the force felt by a certain observer moving along the curve; analogously, curvature in higher dimensions can be regarded as a kind of tidal force (this is one way of thinking of the sectional curvature). This generalization of curvature depends on how nearby test particles diverge or converge when they are allowed to move freely in the space; see Jacobi field.

Another broad generalization of curvature comes from the study of parallel transport on a surface. For instance, if a vector is moved around a loop on the surface of a sphere keeping parallel throughout the motion, then the final position of the vector may not be the same as the initial position of the vector. This phenomenon is known as holonomy. Various generalizations capture in an abstract form this idea of curvature as a measure of holonomy; see curvature form. A closely related notion of curvature comes from gauge theory in physics, where the curvature represents a field and a vector potential for the field is a quantity that is in general path-dependent: it may change if an observer moves around a loop.

Two more generalizations of curvature are the scalar curvature and Ricci curvature. In a curved surface such as the sphere, the area of a disc on the surface differs from the area of a disc of the same radius in flat space. This difference (in a suitable limit) is measured by the scalar curvature. The difference in area of a sector of the disc is measured by the Ricci curvature. Each of the scalar curvature and Ricci curvature are defined in analogous ways in three and higher dimensions. They are particularly important in relativity theory, where they both appear on the side of Einstein&#x27;s field equations that represents the geometry of spacetime (the other side of which represents the presence of matter and energy). These generalizations of curvature underlie, for instance, the notion that curvature can be a property of a measure; see curvature of a measure.

Another generalization of curvature relies on the ability to compare a curved space with another space that has &quot;constant&quot; curvature. Often this is done with triangles in the spaces. The notion of a triangle makes senses in metric spaces, and this gives rise to spaces.

<text>In computer science, ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability) is a set of properties of database transactions intended to guarantee data validity despite errors, power failures, and other mishaps. In the context of databases, a sequence of database operations that satisfies the ACID properties (which can be perceived as a single logical operation on the data) is called a &quot;transaction&quot;. For example, a transfer of funds from one bank account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting another, is a single transaction.

In 1983, Andreas Reuter and Theo Härder coined the acronym &quot;ACID&quot;, building on earlier work by Jim Gray who named atomicity, consistency, and durability, but not isolation, when characterizing the transaction concept. These four properties are the major guarantees of the transaction paradigm, which has influenced many aspects of development in database systems.

According to Gray and Reuter, the IBM Information Management System supported ACID transactions as early as 1973 (although the acronym was created later).

== Characteristics ==
The characteristics of these four properties as defined by Reuter and Härder are as follows:

=== Atomicity ===

Transactions are often composed of multiple statements. Atomicity guarantees that each transaction is treated as a single &quot;unit&quot;, which either succeeds completely or fails completely: if any of the statements constituting a transaction fails to complete, the entire transaction fails and the database is left unchanged. An atomic system must guarantee atomicity in each and every situation, including power failures, errors, and crashes. A guarantee of atomicity prevents updates to the database from occurring only partially, which can cause greater problems than rejecting the whole series outright. As a consequence, the transaction cannot be observed to be in progress by another database client. At one moment in time, it has not yet happened, and at the next, it has already occurred in whole (or nothing happened if the transaction was cancelled in progress).

=== Consistency ===

Consistency ensures that a transaction can only bring the database from one consistent state to another, preserving database invariants: any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, including constraints, cascades, triggers, and any combination thereof. This prevents database corruption by an illegal transaction. An example of a database invariant is referential integrity, which guarantees the primary key–foreign key relationship.

=== Isolation ===

Transactions are often executed concurrently (e.g., multiple transactions reading and writing to a table at the same time). Isolation ensures that concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained if the transactions were executed sequentially. Isolation is the main goal of concurrency control; depending on the isolation level used, the effects of an incomplete transaction might not be visible to other transactions.

=== Durability ===

Durability guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the case of a system failure (e.g., power outage or crash). This usually means that completed transactions (or their effects) are recorded in non-volatile memory.

== Examples ==

The following examples further illustrate the ACID properties. In these examples, the database table has two columns, A and B. An integrity constraint requires that the value in A and the value in B must sum to 100. The following SQL code creates a table as described above:CREATE TABLE acidtest (A INTEGER, B INTEGER, CHECK (A + B = 100));

=== Atomicity ===
Atomicity is the guarantee that series of database operations in an atomic transaction will either all occur (a successful operation), or none will occur (an unsuccessful operation). The series of operations cannot be separated with only some of them being executed, which makes the series of operations &quot;indivisible&quot;. A guarantee of atomicity prevents updates to the database from occurring only partially, which can cause greater problems than rejecting the whole series outright. In other words, atomicity means indivisibility and irreducibility. Alternatively, we may say that a logical transaction may be composed of several physical transactions. Unless and until all component physical transactions are executed, the logical transaction will not have occurred. 

An example of an atomic transaction is a monetary transfer from bank account A to account B. It consists of two operations, withdrawing the money from account A and depositing it to account B. We would not want to see the amount removed from account A before we are sure it has also been transferred into account B. Performing these operations in an atomic transaction ensures that the database remains in a consistent state, that is, money is neither debited nor credited if either of those two operations fails.

=== Consistency failure ===
Consistency is a very general term, which demands that the data must meet all validation rules. In the previous example, the validation is a requirement that . All validation rules must be checked to ensure consistency. Assume that a transaction attempts to subtract 10 from without altering . Because consistency is checked after each transaction, it is known that before the transaction begins. If the transaction removes 10 from successfully, atomicity will be achieved. However, a validation check will show that , which is inconsistent with the rules of the database. The entire transaction must be canceled and the affected rows rolled back to their pre-transaction state. If there had been other constraints, triggers, or cascades, every single change operation would have been checked in the same way as above before the transaction was committed. Similar issues may arise with other constraints. We may have required the data types of both and to be integers. If we were then to enter, say, the value 13.5 for , the transaction will be canceled, or the system may give rise to an alert in the form of a trigger (if/when the trigger has been written to this effect). Another example would be integrity constraints, which would not allow us to delete a row in one table whose primary key is referred to by at least one foreign key in other tables.

=== Isolation failure ===
To demonstrate isolation, we assume two transactions execute at the same time, each attempting to modify the same data. One of the two must wait until the other completes in order to maintain isolation.

Consider two transactions:
* T1 transfers 10 from A to B.
* T2 transfers 20 from B to A.

Combined, there are four actions:
# T1 subtracts 10 from A.
# T1 adds 10 to B.
# T2 subtracts 20 from B.
# T2 adds 20 to A.

If these operations are performed in order, isolation is maintained, although T2 must wait. Consider what happens if T1 fails halfway through. The database eliminates T1&#x27;s effects, and T2 sees only valid data.

By interleaving the transactions, the actual order of actions might be:
# T1 subtracts 10 from A.
# T2 subtracts 20 from B.
# T2 adds 20 to A.
# T1 adds 10 to B.

Again, consider what happens if T1 fails while modifying B in Step 4. By the time T1 fails, T2 has already modified A; it cannot be restored to the value it had before T1 without leaving an invalid database. This is known as a write-write contention, because two transactions attempted to write to the same data field. In a typical system, the problem would be resolved by reverting to the last known good state, canceling the failed transaction T1, and restarting the interrupted transaction T2 from the good state.

=== Durability failure ===
Consider a transaction that transfers 10 from A to B. First, it removes 10 from A, then it adds 10 to B. At this point, the user is told the transaction was a success. However, the changes are still queued in the disk buffer waiting to be committed to disk. Power fails and the changes are lost, but the user assumes (understandably) that the changes persist.

== Implementation ==
Processing a transaction often requires a sequence of operations that is subject to failure for a number of reasons. For instance, the system may have no room left on its disk drives, or it may have used up its allocated CPU time. There are two popular families of techniques: write-ahead logging and shadow paging. In both cases, locks must be acquired on all information to be updated, and depending on the level of isolation, possibly on all data that may be read as well. In write ahead logging, durability is guaranteed by writing the prospective change to a persistent log before changing the database. That allows the database to return to a consistent state in the event of a crash. In shadowing, updates are applied to a partial copy of the database, and the new copy is activated when the transaction commits.

=== Locking vs. multiversioning ===
Many databases rely upon locking to provide ACID capabilities. Locking means that the transaction marks the data that it accesses so that the DBMS knows not to allow other transactions to modify it until the first transaction succeeds or fails. The lock must always be acquired before processing data, including data that is read but not modified. Non-trivial transactions typically require a large number of locks, resulting in substantial overhead as well as blocking other transactions. For example, if user A is running a transaction that has to read a row of data that user B wants to modify, user B must wait until user A&#x27;s transaction completes. Two-phase locking is often applied to guarantee full isolation.

An alternative to locking is multiversion concurrency control, in which the database provides each reading transaction the prior, unmodified version of data that is being modified by another active transaction. This allows readers to operate without acquiring locks, i.e., writing transactions do not block reading transactions, and readers do not block writers. Going back to the example, when user A&#x27;s transaction requests data that user B is modifying, the database provides A with the version of that data that existed when user B started his transaction. User A gets a consistent view of the database even if other users are changing data. One implementation, namely snapshot isolation, relaxes the isolation property.

=== Distributed transactions ===

Guaranteeing ACID properties in a distributed transaction across a distributed database, where no single node is responsible for all data affecting a transaction, presents additional complications. Network connections might fail, or one node might successfully complete its part of the transaction and then be required to roll back its changes because of a failure on another node. The two-phase commit protocol (not to be confused with two-phase locking) provides atomicity for distributed transactions to ensure that each participant in the transaction agrees on whether the transaction should be committed or not. Briefly, in the first phase, one node (the coordinator) interrogates the other nodes (the participants), and only when all reply that they are prepared does the coordinator, in the second phase, formalize the transaction.

<doc id="60777" wikidata="Q193565" url="?curid=60777" title="Limonite">
<text>Limonite () is an iron ore consisting of a mixture of hydrated iron(III) oxide-hydroxides in varying composition. The generic formula is frequently written as , although this is not entirely accurate as the ratio of oxide to hydroxide can vary quite widely. Limonite is one of the three principal iron ores, the others being hematite and magnetite, and has been mined for the production of iron since at least 400 BC.

==Names==
Limonite is named for the Ancient Greek word ( ), meaning &quot;wet meadow&quot;, or ( ), meaning &quot;marshy lake&quot;, as an allusion to its occurrence as in meadows and marshes. In its brown form, it is sometimes called brown hematite or brown iron ore.

==Characteristics==
Limonite is relatively dense with a specific gravity varying from 2.7 to 4.3. It is usually medium to dark yellowish brown in color. The streak of limonite on an unglazed porcelain plate is always yellowish brown, a character which distinguishes it from hematite with a red streak, or from magnetite with a black streak. The hardness is quite variable, ranging from 1 to 5. In thin section it appears as red, yellow, or brown and has a high index of refraction, 2.0–2.4. Limonite minerals are strongly birefringent, but grain sizes are usually too small for this to be detectable.

Although originally defined as a single mineral, limonite is now recognized as a field term for a mixture of related hydrated iron oxide minerals, among them goethite, lepidocrocite, akaganeite, and jarosite. Determination of the precise mineral composition is practical only with X-ray diffraction techniques. Individual minerals in limonite may form crystals, but limonite does not, although specimens may show a fibrous or microcrystalline structure, and limonite often occurs in concretionary forms or in compact and earthy masses; sometimes mammillary, botryoidal, reniform or stalactitic. Because of its amorphous nature, and occurrence in hydrated areas limonite often presents as a clay or mudstone. However, there are limonite pseudomorphs after other minerals such as pyrite. This means that chemical weathering transforms the crystals of pyrite into limonite by hydrating the molecules, but the external shape of the pyrite crystal remains. Limonite pseudomorphs have also been formed from other iron oxides, hematite and magnetite; from the carbonate siderite and from iron rich silicates such as almandine garnets.

==Formation==
Limonite usually forms from the hydration of hematite and magnetite, from the oxidation and hydration of iron rich sulfide minerals, and chemical weathering of other iron rich minerals such as olivine, pyroxene, amphibole, and biotite. It is often the major iron component in lateritic soils, and limonite laterite ores are a source of nickel and potentially cobalt and other valuable metals, present as trace elements. It is often deposited in run-off streams from mining operations.

==Uses==

Nickel-rich limonite ores represent the largest reserves of nickel. Such minerals are classified as lateritic nickel ore deposits.

One of the first uses was as a pigment. The yellow form produced yellow ochre for which Cyprus was famous, while the darker forms produced more earthy tones. Roasting the limonite changed it partially to hematite, producing red ochres, burnt umbers and siennas. Bog iron ore and limonite mudstones are mined as a source of iron. 

&quot;Iron caps&quot; or gossans of siliceous iron oxide typically form as the result of intensive oxidation of sulfide ore deposits. These gossans were used by prospectors as guides to buried ore. 

Limonite was mined for its ancillary gold content. The oxidation of sulfide deposits which contained gold, often resulted in the concentration of gold in the iron oxide and quartz of the gossans. The gold of the primary veins was concentrated into the limonites of the deeply weathered rocks. In another example the deeply weathered iron formations of Brazil served to concentrate gold with the limonite of the resulting soils.

==History==

Limonite was one of the earliest materials used as a pigment by humans, and can be seen in Neolithic cave paintings and pictographs.

While the first iron ore was likely meteoric iron, and hematite was far easier to smelt, in Africa, where the first evidence of iron metallurgy occurs, limonite is the most prevalent iron ore. Before smelting, as the ore was heated and the water driven off, more and more of the limonite was converted to hematite. The ore was then pounded as it was heated above 1250 °C, at which temperature the metallic iron begins sticking together and non-metallic impurities are thrown off as sparks. Complex systems developed, notably in Tanzania, to process limonite. Nonetheless, hematite and magnetite remained the ores of choice when smelting was by bloomeries, and it was only with the development of blast furnaces in the 1st century BCE in China and about 1150 CE in Europe, that the brown iron ore of limonite could be used to best advantage.

Bog iron ore and limonite were mined in the US, but this ended with the development of advanced mining techniques.

Goldbearing limonite gossans were productively mined in the Shasta County, California mining district. Similar deposits were mined near Rio Tinto in Spain and Mount Morgan in Australia. In the Dahlonega gold belt in Lumpkin County, Georgia gold was mined from limonite-rich lateritic or saprolite soil. 

As saprolite deposits have been exhausted in many mining sites, limonite has become the most prominent source of nickel for use in energy dense batteries.

<doc id="60778" wikidata="Q2564082" url="?curid=60778" title="Craig Barrett (chief executive)">
<text>Craig R. Barrett (born August 29, 1939) is an American business executive who served as the chairman of the board of Intel Corporation until May 2009. He became CEO of Intel in 1998, a position he held for seven years. After retiring from Intel, Barrett joined the faculty at Thunderbird School of Global Management in Phoenix.

== Career ==
In 1994, Barrett was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering for technical leadership in advancing quality and productivity through manufacturing technology in the semiconductor industry.

He was appointed as a member of the Hong Kong Chief Executive&#x27;s Council of International Advisers in the years of 1998–2005. He joined the board of trustees of the Society for Science &amp; the Public in 2010.

He serves as president and chairman of BASIS School Inc., a charter school group as well as chair of the board of directors for the National Forest Foundation, the nonprofit partner to the U.S. Forest Service.

=== Employment at Intel Corporation ===
Barrett was employed by Intel Corporation in 1974 as a manager. He was promoted to vice president of the corporation in 1984, to senior vice president in 1987, and executive vice president in 1990. Barrett was elected to Intel&#x27;s board of directors in 1992 and was named the company&#x27;s chief operating officer in 1993. He served as Intel&#x27;s fourth president starting in May 1997 and its chief executive officer from 1998 to 2005. He successfully led the corporation through some of its worst times, including the burst of the dot-com bubble and a severe recession.

He became chairman of the board in May 2005, when he was succeeded as CEO by Paul Otellini. In January 2009, he announced that he would be stepping down as chairman and member of the board at the annual stockholders&#x27; meeting in May 2009.

== Education ==
Barrett attended Stanford University from 1957 to 1964 and received a Ph.D. in Materials Science. During his time at Stanford, he joined the Kappa Sigma fraternity. After graduation, he joined the Stanford University Department of Materials Science and Engineering and remained there until 1974. Barrett was NATO Postdoctoral Fellow at the National Physical Laboratory in the United Kingdom from 1964 to 1965.

Craig and his wife Barbara gave a $10 million endowment to Arizona State University in 2000. In recognition of their donation, Arizona State renamed their honors program Barrett, The Honors College.

== Awards and publications ==
In 1969, Barrett received the Robert Lansing Hardy Award of the Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society and remains a member of the National Academy of Engineering. He is the author of over forty technical papers dealing with the influence of microstructure on the properties of materials and co-authored a textbook on materials science, &quot;The Principles of Engineering Materials&quot;, along with UCLA professor Alan S. Tetelman (founder of Exponent, Inc.) and Stanford professor William D. Nix, published by Prentice-Hall in 1973, which remains in use today.

On January 31, 2006, Barrett and his wife were awarded the Woodrow Wilson Award for Corporate Citizenship by the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.

On June 28, 2009, he was announced the 2009 Laureate of the Global Award of the President of Armenia for Outstanding Contribution to Humanity through IT.

On June 27, 2014, Trinity College Dublin awarded him with an honorary doctorate.

== Family ==

Barret is married to Barbara McConnell Barrett, who was the United States Ambassador to Finland from 2008 to 2009. She was the Secretary of the Air Force under the Trump administration.

<text>In ancient Greek mythology, Amphitrite (; ) was the goddess of the sea, the queen of the sea, and her consort is Poseidon. She was a daughter of Nereus and Doris (or Oceanus and Tethys). Under the influence of the Olympian pantheon, she became the consort of Poseidon and was later used as a symbolic representation of the sea. Her Roman counterpart is Salacia, a comparatively minor figure, and the goddess of saltwater.

==Family==
According to Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot;, Amphitrite was one of the Nereid daughters of Nereus and Doris. The mythographer Apollodorus, however, lists her among both the Nereids, as well as the Oceanids, the daughters of Oceanus and Tethys.

Amphitrite&#x27;s offspring included seals and dolphins. She also bred sea monsters and her great waves crashed against the rocks, putting sailors at risk. Poseidon and Amphitrite had a son, Triton, who was a merman, and a daughter, Rhodos (if this Rhodos was not actually fathered by Poseidon on Halia or was not the daughter of Asopus as others claim). According to the mythographer Apollodorus, Benthesikyme was the daughter of Poseidon and Amphitrite.

==Mythology==
When Poseidon desired to marry her, Amphitrite, wanting to protect her virginity, fled to the Atlas Mountains. Poseidon sent many creatures to find her. A dolphin came across Amphitrite and convinced her to marry Poseidon. As a reward for the dolphin&#x27;s help, Poseidon created the Delphinus constellation.

Eustathius said that Poseidon first saw her dancing at Naxos among the other Nereids, and carried her off. But in another version of the myth, she fled from his advances to Atlas, at the farthest ends of the sea; there the dolphin of Poseidon sought her through the islands of the sea, and finding her, spoke persuasively on behalf of Poseidon, if we may believe Hyginus and was rewarded by being placed among the stars as the constellation Delphinus.

Amphitrite is not fully personified in the Homeric epics: &quot;out on the open sea, in Amphitrite&#x27;s breakers&quot; (&quot;Odyssey&quot; iii.101), &quot;moaning Amphitrite&quot; nourishes fishes &quot;in numbers past all counting&quot; (&quot;Odyssey&quot; xii.119). She shares her Homeric epithet &quot;Halosydne&quot; () with Thetis. In some sense, the sea-nymphs are doublets.

Pindar, in his sixth Olympian Ode, recognized Poseidon&#x27;s role as &quot;great god of the sea, husband of Amphitrite, goddess of the golden spindle.&quot; For later poets, Amphitrite became simply a metaphor for the sea: Euripides, in &quot;Cyclops&quot; (702) and Ovid, &quot;Metamorphoses&quot;, (i.14).

==Representation and cult==
Though Amphitrite does not figure in Greek &quot;cultus&quot;, at an archaic stage she was of outstanding importance, for in the Homeric Hymn to Delian Apollo, she appears at the birthing of Apollo among, in Hugh G. Evelyn-White&#x27;s translation, &quot;all the chiefest of the goddesses, Dione and Rhea and Ichnaea and Themis and loud-moaning Amphitrite&quot;; more recent translators are unanimous in rendering &quot;Ichnaean Themis&quot; rather than treating &quot;Ichnae&quot; as a separate identity. Theseus in the submarine halls of his father Poseidon saw the daughters of Nereus dancing with liquid feet, and &quot;august, ox-eyed Amphitrite&quot;, who wreathed him with her wedding wreath, according to a fragment of Bacchylides. Jane Ellen Harrison recognized in the poetic treatment an authentic echo of Amphitrite&#x27;s early importance: &quot;It would have been much simpler for Poseidon to recognize his own son… the myth belongs to that early stratum of mythology when Poseidon was not yet god of the sea, or, at least, no-wise supreme there—Amphitrite and the Nereids ruled there, with their servants the Tritons. Even so late as the &quot;Iliad&quot; Amphitrite is not yet &#x27;Neptuni uxor&#x27; [Neptune&#x27;s wife].&quot;

Amphitrite, &quot;the third one who encircles [the sea]&quot;, was so entirely confined in her authority to the sea and the creatures in it that she was almost never associated with her husband, either for purposes of worship or in works of art, except when he was to be distinctly regarded as the god who controlled the sea. An exception may be the cult image of Amphitrite that Pausanias saw in the temple of Poseidon at the Isthmus of Corinth (ii.1.7).

In the arts of vase-painting and mosaic, Amphitrite was distinguishable from the other Nereids only by her queenly attributes. In works of art, both ancient ones and post-Renaissance paintings, Amphitrite is represented either enthroned beside Poseidon or driving with him in a chariot drawn by sea-horses (&quot;hippocamps&quot;) or other fabulous creatures of the deep, and attended by Tritons and Nereids. She is dressed in queenly robes and has nets in her hair. The pincers of a crab are sometimes shown attached to her temples.

==Legacy==
* Amphitrite is the name of a genus of the worm family &quot;Terebellidae&quot;.
* In poetry, Amphitrite&#x27;s name is often used for the sea, as a synonym of Thalassa.
* Seven ships of the Royal Navy were named HMS &quot;Amphitrite&quot;
* , which wrecked in 1833 with heavy loss of life while transporting convicts to New South Wales
* Three ships of the United States Navy were named USS &quot;Amphitrite&quot;.
* An asteroid, 29 Amphitrite, is named for her.
* In 1936, Australia used an image of Amphitrite on a postage stamp as a classical allusion for the submarine communications cable across Bass Strait from Apollo Bay, Victoria to Stanley, Tasmania.
*A statue of Amphitrite stands at the United States Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, NY
