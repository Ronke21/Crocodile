<text>Albert Bertel Thorvaldsen (; sometimes given as Thorwaldsen; 19 November 1770 – 24 March 1844) was a Danish-Icelandic sculptor and medalist of international fame, who spent most of his life (1797–1838) in Italy. Thorvaldsen was born in Copenhagen into a working-class Danish/Icelandic family, and was accepted to the Royal Danish Academy of Art at the age of eleven. Working part-time with his father, who was a wood carver, Thorvaldsen won many honors and medals at the academy. He was awarded a stipend to travel to Rome and continue his education.

In Rome, Thorvaldsen made a name for himself as a sculptor. Maintaining a large workshop in the city, he worked in a heroic neo-classicist style. His patrons resided all over Europe.

Upon his return to Denmark in 1838, Thorvaldsen was received as a national hero. The Thorvaldsen Museum was erected to house his works next to Christiansborg Palace. Thorvaldsen is buried within the courtyard of the museum. In his time, he was seen as the successor of master sculptor Antonio Canova. Among his more famous public monuments are the statues of Nicolaus Copernicus and Józef Poniatowski in Warsaw; the statue of Maximilian I in Munich; and the tomb monument of Pope Pius VII, the only work by a non-Catholic in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

==Early life and education==
Thorvaldsen was born in Copenhagen in 1770 (according to some accounts, in 1768), the son of Gottskálk Þorvaldsson, an Icelander who had settled in Denmark. His father was a wood-carver at a ship yard, where he made decorative carvings for large ships and was the early source of influence on his son Bertel&#x27;s development as a sculptor and on his choice of career. Thorvaldsen&#x27;s mother was Karen Dagnes (her surname sometimes is reported as Grønlund), a Jutlandic peasant girl. His birth certificate and baptismal records have never been found, and the only existing record is of his confirmation in 1787. Thorvaldsen had claimed descent from Snorri Thorfinnsson, the first European born in America.

Thorvaldsen&#x27;s childhood in Copenhagen was humble. His father had a drinking habit that slowed his career. Nothing is known of Thorvaldsen&#x27;s early schooling, and he may have been schooled entirely at home. He never became good at writing, and he never acquired much of the knowledge of fine culture that was expected from an artist.

In 1781, by the help of some friends, eleven-year-old Thorvaldsen was admitted to Copenhagen&#x27;s Royal Danish Academy of Art (&quot;Det Kongelige Danske Kunstakademi&quot;), first as a draftsman, and from 1786 at the modeling school. At night he would assist his father with wood carving. Among his professors were Nicolai Abildgaard and Johannes Wiedewelt, who are both likely influences for his later neo-classicist style.

At the Academy he was highly praised for his works. In 1793, he won several prizes, from silver to gold, for a relief of St. Peter healing a crippled beggar. He was consequently granted a Royal stipend, enabling him to complete his studies in Rome. Leaving Copenhagen on 30 August on the frigate &quot;Thetis&quot;, he landed in Palermo in January 1797 and traveled to Naples, where he studied for a month before making his entry to Rome on 8 March 1797. Since the date of his birth had never been recorded, he celebrated this day as his &quot;Roman birthday&quot; for the rest of his life.

==Career==
In Rome he lived at the Casa Buti, on the Via Sistina, in front of the Spanish Steps and had his workshop in the stables of the Palazzo Barberini. He was taken under the wing of Georg Zoëga, a Danish archeologist and numismatist living in Rome. Zoëga took an interest in seeing to it that the young Thorvaldsen acquired an appreciation of the antique arts. As a frequent guest at Zoëga&#x27;s house he met Anna Maria von Uhden, born Magnani. She had worked in Zoëga&#x27;s house as a maid and had married a German archeologist. She became Thorvaldsen&#x27;s mistress and left her husband in 1803. In 1813 she gave birth to a daughter, Elisa Thorvaldsen.

Thorvaldsen also studied with another Dane, Asmus Jacob Carstens whose handling of classic themes became a source of inspiration. Thorvaldsen&#x27;s first success was the model for a statue of Jason; finished in 1801 it was highly praised by Antonio Canova, the most popular sculptor in the city. But the work was slow in selling and his stipend having run out, he planned his return to Denmark. In 1803, as he was set to leave Rome, he received the commission to execute the Jason in marble from Thomas Hope, a wealthy English art-patron. From that time Thorvaldsen&#x27;s success was assured, and he did not leave Italy for sixteen years.

The marble Jason was not finished until 25 years later, as Thorvaldsen quickly became a busy man. Also in 1803, he started work on &quot;Achilles and Briseïs&quot; his first classically themed relief. In 1804 he finished &quot;Dance of the Muses at Helicon&quot; and a group statue of &quot;Cupid and Psyche&quot; and other important early works such as &quot;Apollo, Bacchus og Ganymedes&quot;. During 1805, he had to expand his workshop and enlist the help of several assistants. These assistants undertook most of the marble cutting, and the master limited himself to doing the sketches and finishing touches. Commissioned by Ludwig I of Bavaria in 1808 and finished in 1832 a statue of &quot;Adonis&quot; is one of the few works in marble carved solely by Thorvaldsen&#x27;s own hand, and at the same time it is one of the works that is closest to the antique Greek ideals.

In the spring of 1818 Thorvaldsen fell ill, and during his convalescence he was nursed by the Scottish lady Miss Frances Mackenzie. Thorvaldsen proposed to her on 29 March 1819, but the engagement was cancelled after a month. Thorvaldsen had fallen in love with another woman: Fanny Caspers. Torn between Mackenzie and Anna Maria Von Uhden, the mother of his daughter Elisa Sophia Carlotta von Uhden Thorvaldsen, Thorvaldsen never succeeded in making Miss Caspers his wife.
In 1819, he visited his native Denmark. Here he was commissioned to make the colossal series of statues of Christ and the Twelve Apostles for the rebuilding of Vor Frue Kirke (from 1922 known as the Copenhagen Cathedral) between 1817 and 1829, after its having been destroyed in the British bombardment of Copenhagen in 1807. These were executed after his return to Rome, and were not completed until 1838, when Thorvaldsen returned with his works to Denmark, being received as a hero.

==Death==

Towards the end of 1843 he was prohibited from working for medical reasons, but he began to work again in January 1844. His last composition from 24 March was a sketch for a statue of the &quot;genie&quot; in chalk on a blackboard. At night he had dinner with his friends Adam Oehlenschläger and H. C. Andersen, and he is said to have referred to the finished museum saying: &quot;Now I can die whenever it is time, because Bindesbøll has finished my tomb.&quot;

After the meal he went to the Copenhagen Royal Theatre where he died suddenly from a heart attack. He had bequeathed a great part of his fortune for the building and endowment of a museum in Copenhagen, and left instructions to fill it with all his collection of works of art and the models for all his sculptures, a very large collection, exhibited to the greatest possible advantage. Thorvaldsen is buried in the courtyard of this museum, under a bed of roses, by his own wish.

==Works==


Thorvaldsen was an outstanding representative of the Neoclassical period in sculpture. In fact, his work was often compared to that of Antonio Canova and he became the foremost artist in the field after Canova&#x27;s death in 1822. The poses and expressions of his figures are much more stiff and formal than those of Canova&#x27;s. Thorvaldsen embodied the style of classical Greek art more than the Italian artist, he believed that only through the imitation of classical art pieces could one become a truly great artist.

Motifs for his works (reliefs, statues, and busts) were drawn mostly from Greek mythology, as well as works of classic art and literature. He created portraits of important personalities, as in his statue of Pope Pius VII. Thorvaldsen&#x27;s statue of Pope Pius VII is found in the Clementine Chapel in the Vatican, for which he was the only non-Italian artist to ever have been commissioned to produce a piece. Because he was a Protestant and not a Catholic, the church did not allow him to sign his work. This led to the story of Thorvaldsen sculpting his own face on to the shoulders of the Pope, however any comparison between Thorvaldsen&#x27;s portrait and the sculpture will show that this is just a fanciful story built on some smaller similarities.
His works can be seen in many European countries, especially in the Thorvaldsen Museum in Copenhagen, where his tomb is in the inner courtyard. Thorvaldsen&#x27;s &quot;Lion Monument&quot; (1819) is in Lucerne, Switzerland. This monument commemorates the sacrifice of more than six hundred Swiss Guards who died defending the Tuileries during the French Revolution. The monument portrays a dying lion lying across broken symbols of the French monarchy.

Thorvaldsen produced some striking and affecting statues of historic figures, including two in Warsaw, Poland: an equestrian statue of Prince Józef Poniatowski that now stands before the Presidential Palace; and the seated Nicolaus Copernicus, before the Polish Academy of Sciences building—both located on Warsaw&#x27;s &quot;Krakowskie Przedmieście&quot;. A replica of the Copernicus statue was cast in bronze and installed in 1973 on Chicago&#x27;s lakefront along Solidarity Drive in the city&#x27;s Museum Campus. A statue (Gutenberg Denkmal) of Johannes Gutenberg by Thorvaldsen can be seen in Mainz, Germany.

==Museums and collections==

The Thorvaldsen Museum is the museum in Copenhagen, Denmark where Bertel Thorvaldsen&#x27;s works are displayed. The museum is located on the small island of Slotsholmen in central Copenhagen next to Christiansborg Palace. Designed by Michael Gottlieb Bindesbøll, this building was constructed from public collection funds in 1837. The museum displays a collection of the artist&#x27;s works in marble as well as plaster, including the original plaster models used in the making of cast bronze and marble statues and reliefs, copies of those works that are on display in museums, churches, and at other locations around the world.

The museum also features Bertel Thorvaldsen&#x27;s personal collection of paintings, Greek and Roman sculptures, drawings, and prints the artist collected during his lifetime, as well as personal belongings he used in his work and everyday life.
Outside Europe, Thorvaldsen is less well known. However, in 1896 an American textbook writer wrote that his statue of the resurrected Christ, commonly referred to as &quot;Thorvaldsen&#x27;s Christus&quot; (created for Vor Frue Kirke), was &quot;considered the most perfect statue of Christ in the world.&quot; The statue has appealed to the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) and a 3.4 m replica is on display at Temple Square in Salt Lake City, Utah. There is also a replica of this statue in visitors&#x27; centers associated with the LDS Church&#x27;s temples in Mesa, Arizona, Laie, Hawaii, México City, Los Angeles, California, Portland, Oregon, Washington D.C., Hamilton, New Zealand, and São Paulo, Brazil, along with visitors&#x27; centers in Independence, Missouri, and Nauvoo, Illinois. The Christus is also a feature of the visitors&#x27; center associated with the church&#x27;s Rome Italy Temple, where it is displayed alongside Thorvaldsen&#x27;s statues of the Twelve Apostles also from Vor Frue Kirke. In the Paris France Temple it is an outdoor feature, placed in the courtyard. Additionally, the LDS Church has historically used images of the statue in official church media, with this increasing with its use as a formal symbol, beginning in April 2020.

Additional replicas of the &quot;Christus&quot; include a full-size replica at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland within its iconic dome, and a full-sized copy in bronze at the Ben H. Powell III family plot in Oakwood Cemetery in Huntsville, Texas as a memorial to the Powell&#x27;s son Rawley.

Thorvaldsen&#x27;s &quot;Christus&quot; was recreated in Lego by parishioners of a Swedish Protestant church in Västerås and unveiled on Easter Sunday 2009.

Thorvaldsen&#x27;s primary mastery was his feel for the rhythm of lines and movements. Nearly all his sculptures can be viewed from any chosen angle without compromise of their impact. In addition, he had the ability to work in monumental size. Thorvaldsen&#x27;s classicism was strict; nevertheless his contemporaries saw his art as the ideal, although afterwards art took new directions. A bronze copy of Thorvaldsen&#x27;s &quot;Self-Portrait&quot; stands in Central Park, New York, near the East 97 Street entrance.

<text>Ramon Muntaner () (1265 – 1336) was a Catalan mercenary and writer who wrote the &quot;Crònica&quot;, a chronicle of his life, including his adventures as a commander in the Catalan Company. He was born at Peralada.

== Biography ==
The Catalan Company was an army of light infantry under the leadership of Roger de Flor that was made up of Aragonese and Catalan mercenaries, known as Almogavars; Roger led the Company to Constantinople to help the Greeks against the Turks.

For a lapse of time (1308-1315) he was governor of Djerba after its conquest by the Crown of Aragon.

Ramon Muntaner&#x27;s &quot;Crònica&quot; is one of the four &quot;Catalan Grand Chronicles&quot; through which the historian views thirteenth- and fourteenth century military and political matters in the Crown of Aragon and the Principality of Catalonia.

He died at Ibiza in 1336.

<text>Joanot Martorell (; c. 1410 – 1465) was a Valencian knight and writer, best known for authoring the novel &quot;Tirant lo Blanch&quot;, written in Catalan/Valencian and published at Valencia in 1490. This novel is often regarded as one of the peaks of the literature in Catalan language and it played a major role in influencing later writers such as Miguel de Cervantes, who, in the book burning scene of Don Quixote, says &quot;I swear to you, my friend, this (Tirant lo Blanch) is the best book of its kind in the world&quot;. The novel deals with the adventures of a knight in the Byzantine Empire; it is considered one of the first works of alternate history.

Martorell apparently was a chivalrous man and suffered an early death due to court intrigue, leaving the novel unfinished. It was prepared for publication by his friend and colleague, Martí Joan de Galba.

== Biography ==
Martorell was born in Valencia around the year 1410. According to the historian Jaume Chiner, Martorell&#x27;s family was originally from Gandía. His grandfather, Guillem Martorell, was a royal advisor and his father, Francesc Martorell, married to Damiata Abelló, was butler to King Martin the Humane. A sister of Joanot Martorell, Isabel, was married to Ausiàs March.

There are many biographical details that show Martorell to have been a combative and aggressive knight with a hectic life, marked by various trips and knightly adventures, although most of his disputes, including the challenges to the death, did not go beyond verbal duels. His first appointment of knighthood dates to 1433.

Martorell spent many years in England (on one of his stays, in 1438, he translated the 12th-century poem &quot;Guy of Warwick&quot;), Portugal and Naples, as a result of various knightly disputes of which he was so fond, and about which information exists thanks to the fourteen &quot;lletres de batalla&quot; (battle letters, or exchanged letters) that Martorell wrote throughout his life and that were published in the editions of &quot;Tirante el Blanco&quot; edited by Martí de Riquer in 1969 and 1979.

The confrontations Martorell had include the following:

* On one occasion, Martorell challenged his cousin Joan de Monpalau. Monpalau had apparently been in love with a sister of Martorell&#x27;s and had promised to marry her, then refused to keep his promise. The dispute lasted from 1437 to 1445.
* Between 1444 and 1450 there is evidence of another dispute with Gonzalo de Híjar, commander of Montalbán, over a matter related to the sale of some properties. It was settled in favor of Martorell.
* In 1442 he had another lawsuit against Philip Boïl, for reasons of testimony.

In 1454, Martorell traveled to Naples to help Alfonso the Magnanimous.

He lived in Plaça de Sant Jordi (now Plaça de Rodrigo Botet), a neighbor of Joan Roís de Corella. After the sale of his estates, his financial ruin increased; Martí Joan de Galba, who lived in Valencia, often lent him money because Martorell was in such great need.

Martorell died in Valencia, leaving no descendants. The date of his death is placed at the beginning of 1465.

== Literature ==
Martorell had access to a diverse array of books that later became his source of inspiration. On 2 January 1460 he began to write &quot;Tirant lo Blanch&quot; (Tirante the White), which he dedicated to Prince Ferdinand of Portugal, whom he met in that country. It was one of the most representative works of the Valencian Golden Age. The novel narrates the war exploits of the knight Tirant and his romance with Carmesina, written with a highly erotic charge. It’s considered the first modern novel in Europe and one of the most important works in all literature. &quot;Tirant&quot; was first published in 1490 in Valencia and later in Barcelona. Of these two first editions, four copies have been preserved. Three copies are from the first edition published in Valencia: one is at the University of Valencia, one is in London and one in New York. The fourth preserved copy is of the second edition published in Barcelona. In the first half of the 16th century, the novel was translated into Spanish and Italian, and later into French. It was known by Ariosto, Shakespeare and Cervantes. In fact, &quot;Tirant lo Blanch&quot; received praise from Cervantes, who saved the novel from the burning of chivalric books at the home of Alonso Quijano by the priest and the barber in the first part of &quot;Don Quixote de la Mancha&quot;.

Some evidence suggests that the work that came out of Nicolás Spindeler&#x27;s printing press in 1490 does not exactly correspond to the original manuscript that Martorell gave to Martí Joan de Galba. The original was given to Galba as a pledge for the hundred reales Martorell had received on loan, and which Galba was unable to recover, having died before the deadline stipulated for returning the money.

The colophon states that Galba is the translator of the fourth part of the novel; however, that is probably an addition by the printer, since Galba, who was not a writer, died before it was finished printing. Some think instead that Galba merely divided the work into chapters and wrote his own rubrics. Another possibility, though, is that the original version that first circulated in manuscript form for 25 years was subject to some occasional additions, perhaps inspired by Joan Roís de Corella.

Martorell left an unfinished work, &quot;Guillem de Varoic&quot;, which he had incorporated into the first chapters of &quot;Tirant&quot;, and a fragment of &quot;Flor de caballeria&quot;, the latter of possible attribution.

<doc id="65129" wikidata="Q2754" url="?curid=65129" title="Jaroslav Hašek">
<text>Jaroslav Hašek (; 1883–1923) was a Czech writer, humorist, satirist, journalist, bohemian, first anarchist and then communist, and commissar of the Red Army against the Czechoslovak Legion. He is best known for his novel &quot;The Fateful Adventures of the Good Soldier Švejk During the World War&quot;, an unfinished novel about a soldier in World War I and a satire on the ineptitude of authority figures. The novel has been translated into about 60 languages, making it the most translated novel in Czech literature.

== Life ==
Jaroslav Hašek&#x27;s paternal ancestors were farmers rooted in Mydlovary in South Bohemia. Hašek&#x27;s grandfather from his father&#x27;s side, František Hašek, was a member of the Czech Landtag and later also the so-called Kromeriz convention. He was also involved in barricade fights in Prague in 1848. According to some rumors, he worked with Mikhail Bakunin during his stay in Bohemia in 1849. 

The family of his mother, Katherine, née Jarešová, was also from South Bohemia. His grandfather Antonín Jareš and his great-grandfather Matěj Jareš were pond-keepers of the Schwarzenberg princes in Krč village No. 32.

His father, Josef Hašek, a mathematics teacher and religious fanatic, died early of alcohol intoxication. He put an end to himself due to pain caused by cancer. Poverty then forced his mother Kateřina with three children to move more than fifteen times.

At the age of four, the doctor diagnosed a heart defect and &quot;stunted thyroid gland&quot; in little Jaroslav. Because of this, he spent a lot of time in the country, with his grandfather from his mother&#x27;s side, in the so-called Ražice dam-house, especially with his younger brother Bohuslav. In his childhood, Jaroslav was jealous of Bohuslav and even tried several times to hurt him as a baby. Later they had an extremely strong relationship and traveled together a lot on foot. Bohuslav drank himself to death one year after Jaroslav&#x27;s death.

Hašek&#x27;s childhood was ordinary, boyish, imbued with adventures with peers and reading Karl May and Jules Verne. However, this changed when Hašek was eleven: the retired sailor Němeček moved to Lipová Street, where the Hašeks lived at that time. Němeček wrapped the teenage Hašek around his little finger, pilfered the money that Hašek had stolen at home, and began to lead him into bars, including the infamous Jedová chýše (Poison Hut) on Apolinářská Street, where he taught him to drink alcohol. In addition, he intentionally had sex with his girlfriend in front of the boy. It was a trauma for Hašek. He later remembered these experiences with disgust and remorse. It probably influenced Hašek&#x27;s relationship with women. In his discussions with his comrades in the Russian legions, it is said that he said: &quot;Can there be anything worse in the world than such a human pig? I didn&#x27;t know anything about these things, and yet I felt such disgust and revulsion that it was enough to poison my whole life. I could never look at the woman again and I have also been afraid of women since then.&quot;
 Some theories about Hašek&#x27;s homosexuality, spread mainly by the literary historian Jindřich Chalupecký (the essay &quot;Podivný Hašek&quot; in the book &quot;Expresionisté&quot;), have also originated here, as well as in the testimony of Hašek&#x27;s friend Rudolf Šimanovský.

Shortly after Hašek began his studies at the grammar school in Ječná Street, his father died. In 1897 he was present at anti-German riots in Prague as a student. He was arrested and the gymnasium teachers forced him to &quot;voluntarily&quot; leave the institution. He then trained as a druggist in Kokoška&#x27;s drugstore on the corner of Perštýn and Martinská Street, but eventually graduated from the Czech-Slavonic Business Academy in Resslova Street. 
 At the academy he made friends with Ladislav Hájek, and together they wrote and released a parody of the lyrical love poetry of May Shouts, in which Hašek first laughed at pathos and entered the field of humorous literature.

After graduation, he became an employee of Slavia Bank but soon began to earn his living exclusively in journalism and literature. At that time he also met Czech anarchists. He began to lead a bohemian and vagrant life. Together with his brother Bohuslav, he walked through, among other places, Slovakia and western Galicia (now in Poland). Stories from these trips were published by Jaroslav Hašek in &quot;Národní listy&quot;.

In 1907, he became editor of the anarchist magazine &quot;Komuna&quot; and was briefly imprisoned for his work.

In the same year, he fell in love with Jarmila Mayerová, but because of his bohemian life, her parents did not consider him a suitable partner for their daughter. When he was arrested for desecrating the Austro-Hungarian flag in Prague, Mayer&#x27;s parents took her to the countryside in the hope that it would help end their relationship. In response, Hašek tried to back out of his radical politics and get permanent work as a writer. In 1908 he edited the &quot;Women&#x27;s Horizon&quot;. In 1909 he had sixty-four published short stories, and the same year he was appointed editor of &quot;Animal World&quot; magazine. Hašek&#x27;s engagement with Svět zvířat, i.e. &quot;Animal World, w&quot;as only the second time in his life that he was permanently employed, and now he lasted much longer in the job than he did at Banka Slavia, probably around 20 months. 

Every period of Jaroslav Hašek’s life is shrouded in legend, none more so than his time as editor of &quot;The Animal World&quot;. Most widespread is the claim that Hašek “embellished” the magazine with stories about imaginary species and that this was the reason for his dismissal (an echo of Marek in &quot;Švejk&quot;). Further, claims exist that he advertised werewolves for sale and allegedly published stories about the &quot;terrible guzzler&quot; and other fantasy creatures in the magazine. In the journal itself, there is, however, no trace of these creatures…The seed for the legends was planted by none other than Hašek himself and, over the years, spread by his friends and biographers (Josef Mach, Franta Sauer, Emil Artur Longen, Václav Menger, Josef Lada and others). Hašek’s mystifications, enhanced by the tales of his friends, eventually entered the sphere of serious haškology and were later firmly planted in the anglophone world by Cecil Parrott, arguably the all-time leading Hašek-expert outside Czechoslovakia.

Parrott, in his otherwise solid biography “The Bad Bohemian” (1978), asserted that “Hašek was an accomplished and persuasive hoaxer”, then in a later chapter unreservedly propagated claims by Menger and Lada about Hašek advertising werewolves, having caused a stir even amongst foreign scientists with his “discovery” of a prehistoric flea (again echoed by Marek). Parrott was correct in claiming that Hašek was an accomplished hoaxer, but didn’t fully realize HOW accomplished he was! Not that Parrott was alone in falling into the trap. It is difficult to find any scholar or amateur alike, who didn’t propagate these claims at one time or another. In 2024, looking at Wikipedia articles in various languages is enough. As an example, wikipedia.com (as of 1.1.2025): “&quot;and the same year he was appointed editor of Animal World magazine. Although this work did not last long (he was soon released for publishing articles on imaginary animals he had invented&quot;).&quot;”&quot;

Obtaining permanent employment at  Animal World was instrumental in overcoming Jarmila Mayerová&#x27;s parent&#x27;s resistance to her marrying Hašek, and the wedding took place on 23 May 1910. However, after a year of marriage, Jarmila returned to her parents after Hašek was detained after trying to feign his own death. According to other sources, however, this was a serious attempt at suicide, motivated by the understanding that he was unable to live a marital life. After this attempt, he was briefly hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital.

From 1911, he contributed to the &quot;Czech Word&quot;, then to the &quot;Torch&quot;, &quot;Humorist Letters&quot;, &quot;Nettle&quot;, &quot;Cartoons&quot;, and for some time led the Institute of Cynology, which inspired his later book &quot;My Dog Shop&quot;.

In 1911, he founded The Party of Moderate Progress Within the Bounds of the Law. He founded it with his friends in the Vinohrady pub called U zlatého litru (The Golden Liter) to parody the political life of that time. He also wrote the satirical work &quot;Political and Social History of the Party of Mild Progress within the limits of the law&quot;, but it was not published in book form until 1963.

During this period, together with František Langer, Emil Artur Longen and Egon Erwin Kisch he co-authored a number of cabaret performances, where he was also the main performer.

In the summer of 1912, Hašek spent several weeks in a pub in Chotěboř, where he could not be gotten rid of and the proprietors waited in vain for payment. He described his stay in Chotěboř in the stories &quot;Traitor of the Nation in Chotěboř&quot;, the &quot;District Court in Malibor&quot;, and &quot;How about the birthplace of Ignát Herrmann or the Consecration in Krivice&quot;.

At the outbreak of the First World War, Hašek lived with the cartoonist Josef Lada, who later illustrated the &quot;Good Soldier Švejk&quot;.

In February 1915, Hašek was called up to the replacement battalion of the 91st Regiment of the Austro-Hungarian army in České Budějovice. With the 12th march battalion of the regiment, he was in early July transported to the Eastern front in Galicia (now Ukraine). He served on the front until 24 September 1915 when he was captured by the Russians and sent to the Totskoye camp in Orenburg Governorate. Here he joined the Czechoslovak Legion in 1916. Then he was drafted into the 1st Regiment, where he worked as a scribe, emissary of the recruitment committee and gunner. Then he was transferred to the connecting section, machine-gun section (in which he participated in the Battle of Zborov against the Austrians) and the office of the 1st Regiment. From July 1916 to February 1918 he published in the journal &quot;Čechoslovan and Cs. soldier&quot;, and was the author of a number of anti-Bolshevik articles.

At the end of February 1918, he joined the Czechoslovak Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party (forerunner of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, 1921–1992). What led Hašek to abandon anarchism and to accept socialist ideals has nowhere been clarified. In March, the Czechoslovak legions embarked on their well-known retreat, with the aim of joining the Western Front via Vladivostok. Hašek disagreed with this and went to Moscow, where he began to cooperate with the Bolsheviks. In April he transferred from the legions to the Red Army. He was sent to Samara and the following year he was director of the army printer in Ufa, chief of the department for work with foreigners, etc. At the end of 1918 he served as commander of the Chuvash troops in the Red Army and as deputy military commander of the Bugulma district. He then worked in Siberia, where he published several magazines. One of them was also the first magazine in the Buryat language, &quot;Jur&quot; (Dawn).

In 1920, he was wounded in an assassination attempt in Irkutsk, where he served as a member of the city soviet. In the same year he fell ill with typhoid fever, and in May he married a printing worker named Alexandra Grigorievna Lvova, called Shura, who took care of him after his illness. After his return to Czechoslovakia, he was not tried for polygamy because of the lack of order and recognition of various international treaties in Russia.

In December 1920, Hašek returned to independent Czechoslovakia. He was initially placed in quarantine in Pardubice, and on 19 December he arrived in Prague with Shura. The Soviets had sent him to Czechoslovakia to organize the communist movement. However, he was prevented from doing so by two circumstances: on the one hand, in support of the Kladno riots, he received from the Russian authorities an amount of 1,500 marks, which, however, was completely devalued by German inflation. In addition, even before Hašek&#x27;s arrival in Prague, Jaroslav Handlíř, leader of a clutch of Russian agents whom Hašek was to contact, was arrested in Czechoslovakia. In this way Hašek&#x27;s interest in communist politics ended and he returned to his bohemian way of life. He visited pubs in Prague and its surroundings, where he wrote his stories. Many stories describing this period were written by Hašek&#x27;s friend Zdeněk Matěj Kuděj.

On 25 August 1921 Hašek left with his wife Shura and painter Jaroslav Panuška for Lipnice nad Sázavou. By this time he was seriously ill and dangerously obese. In Lipnice he began writing his masterpiece, &quot;The Fate of the Good Soldier Švejk During the World War&quot;. Eventually, he was, unable to write, yet he continued to dictate Švejk&#x27;s chapters in his bedroom. On 3 January 1923, he died of heart disease. The last known photograph was taken in December 1922.
== Contradictions and points of interest ==
In the Czech and Slovak public imagination Jaroslav Hašek is fixed as a bohemian, perhaps even the prototypical bohemian of the early twentieth century. In fact, this is largely a legend and represents Hašek&#x27;s self-stylization. An internally disciplined author, Hašek was very productive. From his works it is also apparent that he had an extensive (perhaps a little unsystematic) humanistic education.

It is most instructive to consider Hašek&#x27;s work in Russia during 1916 to 1920. He has never been and still is not perceived as a mere bohemian or humorist writer in Russia, but, on the contrary, as a very responsible Bolshevik army official and a respected intellectual. He was also a relatively skilled soldier. In 1918 he distinguished himself as a courageous commander of the Czechoslovak Red Army troops in the defense of Samara. Samara was at that time threatened from the direction of Lipyagi station by the Czechoslovak legions, which were fighting alongside the White troops to restore the imperial regime, although the legionnaires tried to maintain essential neutrality and fight against the Bolsheviks only when inevitable. On 8 June 1918, Samara was conquered by the legions. It is possible that at this time, Jaroslav Hašek met with Czech &quot;brothers&quot; and may have encouraged them to leave the White-Russian party. After the fall of Samara, he was in hiding in a territory controlled by White troops (and Czechoslovak legions) for several months.

It is possible that in specific revolutionary Russian conditions, Hašek was given the opportunity to assert those aspects of his character that could not manifest themselves in stabilized and essentially small-town Czech conditions. It was also important that Hašek was banned by his Party organization from drinking alcohol. He was basically sent to Czechoslovakia with the aim of organizing the communist movement, which also supports the thesis that he had to be perceived as a responsible person and a capable organizer in Soviet Russia.

A subject of debate and speculation is how Hašek behaved in the Red Army, especially at a time when he was a Commissioner – and deputy commander – of Bugulma.

Hašek&#x27;s had close contact with a number of revolutionaries including Lev Trotsky. Hašek&#x27;s closest collaborators in Russia – Nikolai Ivanovich Kochkurov (&quot;Artem Vesely&quot;) or Vladimir Yakovlevich Zazubrin – later became victims of Stalin&#x27;s repression.

There is also speculation about Hašek&#x27;s mysterious mission to Mongolia, which he probably undertook in Soviet service. The writer Pavel Gan claims that he was there in conjunction with the Chinese revolutionary Chen Chang-Hai, alias Vanya Chang, and was going to go with him to China, for which reason he probably learned solid Chinese.

A not-well-known aspect of Hašek&#x27;s biography is that after returning to his homeland he found himself somewhat isolated. He was uncomfortable from left to right. After he left communist politics, for example, Stanislav Kostka Neumann described him as a &quot;traitor to the proletarian revolution&quot;. For the poet Karel Toman he was branded a &quot;traitor of the nation&quot; by his red arm band and refused to shake his hand when he met him in a café after the war. There were more such hostile reactions. Hašek&#x27;s departure to Lipnice, where he wrote &quot;Švejk&quot;, was motivated by the hostile atmosphere he met in Prague.

== Works ==
Initially Hašek wrote mainly travel stories, features and humoresques, which he published in magazines. He wrote most of his works in Prague pubs.

His prose was based on his own real experiences, confusing investigation of his actual life, because it is not always clear what is true and what is only poetic hyperbole.

Hašek hated pretense, sentimentality, settled life, to which he ironically reacted in satiric verse. Another characteristic feature of his work is resistance to moral and literary conventions.

In his life, he wrote about 1,200 short stories. Most of his short prose is scattered throughout various magazines and newspapers. Over the years nearly all the stories have been collected and printed in book&#x27;s form. Some texts may however have been lost, for example, the story &quot;The History of the Ox.&quot; There is also a number of texts of which Hašek&#x27;s authorship is likely, but not confirmed.

Words flowed easily from his pen, but this does not mean that he was not creative. František Langer stated that &quot;he was attracted, controlled, absorbed by writing, driven by his almost passionate passion for his writing.&quot;

His most famous text by far, the four-part humorous novel &quot;The Fate of the Good Soldier Švejk During the World War&quot;, has been translated into 58 languages and several times filmed and dramatized. Individual parts of the novel have the names: &quot;In the Background (1921)&quot;, &quot;At the Front (1922)&quot;, &quot;Famous Spanking (1922)&quot; and &quot;Unfinished Continuation of the Famous Spanking&quot; (1923). Hašek&#x27;s most important work is associated by many people with congenial illustrations by Josef Lada. Hašek did not manage to complete the book. The completion of the work by Karel Vaněk is far from Hašek&#x27;s original conception. Vanek&#x27;s completion was based on the continuation of 1921, but was highly criticized (Viktor Dyk, Jaroslav Durych, F. X. Šalda etc.). At first, the work had few followers. Ivan Olbracht was probably the first to mark it as a major work in the cultural section of &quot;Rudé právo&quot;. &quot;It is one of the best books ever written in the Czech Republic, and Svejk is quite a new type in world literature, equivalent to Don Quixote, Hamlet, Faust, Oblomov, Karamazov,&quot; Olbracht wrote. Karel Čapek, Josef Čapek, Julius Fučík and Vítězslav Nezval, who connected Hašek&#x27;s work with Dadaism, also adopted a positive attitude, as did Devětsil theoretician Bedřich Václavek. Discussions on the value of the work continued in later years. For example, Václav Černý opposed Švejk, but a wide range of Czech literary theorists, artists, and intellectuals had other views – the philosopher Karel Kosík saw the novel as &quot;an expression of the absurdity of the alienated world&quot;; he described Švejk as the &quot;tragic bard of European nihilism. The aesthetist Jan Grossman associated Švejk with existentialism; the literary theorist Jindřich Chalupecký described Švejk as the &quot;tragic bard of European nihilism,&quot;; and the writer Milan Kundera described the novel as &quot;the pure irrationality of history.&quot;.

Švejk has been dramatized several times, Hašek himself performed the first dramatization for the Emil Artur Longen &quot;Revolutionary Scene&quot;; in 1928 Švejk turned into a theater performance of Hašek&#x27;s friend Max Brod, in 1963 by Pavel Kohout. The international adaptation was achieved by the adaptation of &quot;Schweik in the Second World War&quot; by the German playwright and director Bertold Brecht.

<text>Bohumil Hrabal (; 28 March 1914 – 3 February 1997) was a Czech writer, often named among the best Czech writers of the 20th century.

== Early life ==
Hrabal was born in Židenice (suburb of Brno) on 28 March 1914, in what was then the province of Moravia within Austria-Hungary, to an unmarried mother, Marie Božena Kiliánová (1894–1970). According to the organisers of a 2009 Hrabal exhibition in Brno, his biological father was probably Bohumil Blecha (1893–1970), a teacher&#x27;s son a year older than Marie, who was her friend from the neighbourhood. Marie&#x27;s parents opposed the idea of their daughter marrying Blecha, as he was about to serve in the Austro-Hungarian Army. World War I started four months after Hrabal&#x27;s birth, and Blecha was sent to the Italian front, before being invalided out of service. Blecha&#x27;s daughter, Drahomíra Blechová-Kalvodová, says her father told her when she was 18 that Hrabal was her half-brother. Bohumil and his biological father never met formally, according to Blechová-Kalvodová. Hrabal and Blechová-Kalvodová met twice; a dedication on a picture from 1994 says: &quot;To sister Drahomíra, Hrabal!&quot;

Hrabal was baptised Bohumil František Kilián. Until the age of three, he lived mainly with his grandparents, Kateřina Kiliánová (born Bartlová) (d. 1950) and Tomáš Kilián (died 1925), a descendant of a French soldier injured at the Battle of Austerlitz, in Brno, while his mother worked in Polná as an assistant book-keeper in the town&#x27;s brewery. She worked there with her future husband, František Hrabal (1889– 1966); one František Hrabal was listed as Bohumil&#x27;s godfather when he was baptised on 4 April 1914, but František was also the first name of Bohumil&#x27;s future step-grandfather, a soft-drinks trader. František Hrabal, Hrabal&#x27;s stepfather, was a friend of Blecha. He is a prominent character in some of Hrabal&#x27;s most famous fiction work, and in &quot;Gaps&quot;, the second volume of his autobiographical trilogy, Hrabal wrote that he declined an invitation to meet his biological father and considered František Hrabal to be his father.

Marie and František married in February 1917, shortly before Bohumil&#x27;s second birthday. Hrabal&#x27;s half-brother, Břetislav Josef Hrabal (1916–1985), was born later that year; Břetislav, known as Slávek, is said to have been an excellent raconteur. The family moved in August 1919 to Nymburk, a town on the banks of the Elbe River, where František Hrabal became the manager of a brewery. Both Marie and František were involved in amateur dramatics, though Marie was more active. Hrabal later recalled having a complex about this, and feeling embarrassed by her being the centre of attention.
Hrabal&#x27;s uncle was Bohuslav Kilián (1892–1942), a lawyer, journalist and publisher of the cultural magazines &quot;Salon&quot; and &quot;Měsíc&quot;. The latter had a German version, &quot;Der Monat&quot;, that was distributed throughout Europe, but not in Nazi Germany.

In 1920, Hrabal started primary school in Nymburk. In September 1925, he spent one year at a grammar school in Brno (now Gymnázium třída Kapitána Jaroše, later attended by Milan Kundera). He failed the first year, and later attended a technical secondary school in Nymburk. There too he struggled to concentrate on his studies, despite extra tutoring from his uncle.

==Wartime activities and early adulthood==
In June 1934, Hrabal left school with a certificate that said he could be considered for a place at university on a technical course. He took private classes in Latin for a year, passing the state exam in the town of Český Brod with an &quot;adequate&quot; grade on 3 October 1935. On 7 October, he registered at Charles University in Prague to study for a law degree. He graduated only in March 1946, as Czech universities were shut down in 1939 and remained so until the end of Nazi occupation. During the war, he worked as a railway labourer and dispatcher in Kostomlaty, near Nymburk, an experience reflected in one of his best-known works, &quot;Closely Observed Trains&quot; (). He worked variously as an insurance agent (1946–47), a travelling salesman (1947–49) and a manual labourer alongside the graphic artist Vladimír Boudník in the Kladno steelworks (1949–52, and again briefly, 1953), an experience that inspired the &quot;total realism&quot; of texts such as &quot;Jarmilka&quot; that he was writing at the time. After a serious injury, he worked in a recycling mill in the Prague district of Libeň as a paper packer (1954–59), before working as a stagehand (1959–62) at the S. K. Neumann Theatre in Prague (today Divadlo pod Palmovkou).
Hrabal lived in the city from the late 1940s onward, for much of it (1950–73) at 24 Na Hrázi ul. in Prague - Libeň; the house was demolished in 1988. In 1956, Hrabal married Eliška Plevová (known as &quot;Pipsi&quot; to Hrabal, and referred to by that name in some of his works), the 30-year-old daughter of Karel Pleva, procurator and manager of a wood factory in the South Moravian town of Břeclav. In 1965, the couple bought a country cottage in Kersko, near Nymburk; the cottage became home to his numerous cats. Eliška died in 1987.

==Early writing career==
Hrabal began as a poet, producing a collection of lyrical poetry in 1948, entitled &quot;Ztracená ulička&quot;. It was withdrawn from circulation when the communist regime was established. In the early 1950s, Hrabal was a member of an underground literary group run by Jiří Kolář, an artist, poet, critic and central figure in Czechoslovak culture. Another member of the group was the novelist Josef Škvorecký. Hrabal produced stories for the group, but did not seek publication.

Two stories by Hrabal (&quot;Hovory lidí&quot;) appeared in 1956 as a supplement in the annual &quot;Report of the Association of Czech Bibliophiles&quot; (), which had a print-run of 250. Hrabal&#x27;s first book was withdrawn a week before publication, in 1959. It was eventually published in 1963, as &quot;Pearls of the Deep&quot; (). In the same year, he became a professional writer. &quot;Dancing Lessons for the Advanced in Age&quot; () followed in 1964 and &quot;Closely Observed Trains&quot; () in 1965.

==Ban from publication and later career==

After the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968, Hrabal was banned from publishing. In 1970, two of his books – &quot;Domácí úkoly&quot; and &quot;Poupata&quot; – were banned, after they had been printed and bound but before they were distributed. In the following years, he published several of his best known works in samizdat editions (including &quot;The Little Town Where Time Stood Still&quot; () and &quot;I Served the King of England&quot; ().

In 1975, Hrabal gave an interview to the publication &quot;Tvorba&quot; in which he made self-critical comments, which enabled some of his work to appear in print, albeit typically in heavily edited form. Hrabal&#x27;s interlocutors were anonymous in the journal, but it was later discovered that the published interview was at least a third version of the text, and that the more explicitly ideological statements were inserted by editors Karel Sýs and Jaromír Pelc according to contemporary party doctrine. One such passage reads &quot;...as a Czech writer I am connected to the Czech people, with its Socialist past and future&quot;.

Some young dissidents were incensed by Hrabal&#x27;s actions; poet Ivan &quot;Magor&quot; Jirous organised an event on Kampa Island at which his books were burned, and the singer Karel Kryl called him a &quot;whore&quot;. However, his defenders point out that an edited version of a key text, &quot;Handbook for the Apprentice Palaverer&quot; (), was published alongside the interview, which ended the ban on publication and permitted his work once again to reach the broader Czechoslovak public. Ludvík Vaculík, who had published his work in samizdat and would later continue to do so, defended him, saying that the interview demonstrated that Hrabal was a writer of such standing that he could not be suppressed and the regime had had to acknowledge him. Additionally, some of his writings continued to be printed only in samizdat and as underground editions abroad, including &quot;Too Loud a Solitude&quot; () which circulated in a number of samizdat editions until it was finally published officially in 1989. Hrabal avoided political engagement, and he was not a signatory of the Charter 77 civic initiative against the communist regime in 1977.

Hrabal&#x27;s two best-known novels are &quot;Closely Observed Trains&quot; () (1965) and &quot;I Served the King of England&quot; (1971), both of which were made into movies by the Czech director Jiří Menzel (in 1966 and 2006, respectively). Hrabal worked closely with Menzel on the script for &quot;Closely Watched Trains&quot; which won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film in 1968. The two men became close friends and subsequently collaborated on other film projects, including the long-banned 1969 film &quot;Larks on a String&quot;.

Hrabal was a noted raconteur, and much of his story-telling took place in a number of pubs including, most famously, U zlatého tygra (At the Golden Tiger) on Husova Street in Prague. He met the Czech President Václav Havel, the American President Bill Clinton and the US ambassador to the UN Madeleine Albright at U zlatého tygra on 11 January 1994.

==Death==

Hrabal died in February 1997 after falling from a window on the fifth floor of Bulovka Hospital in Prague. Initially, there were reports that he fell while attempting to feed pigeons, though these were rejected by friends including his translator, Susanna Roth, who angrily dismissed the reports as a way of censoring Hrabal even in death. The story was later publicly renounced by professor Pavel Dungl, Bulovka&#x27;s chief physician. First Roth and later Tomáš Mazal noted that suicide recurs as a theme throughout his work, and both Dungl and Mazal said that early in the morning on the day of his death, Hrabal mentioned to Dungl an &quot;invitation&quot; he received in his dream from a dead poet and painter, Karel Hlaváček, who was buried in a cemetery next to the hospital. Some years later, Professor Dungl said he had no doubts about Hrabal&#x27;s death being a suicide. He was buried in the cemetery of Hradištko near Kersko. According to his wishes, he was buried in an oak coffin marked with the inscription &quot;Pivovar Polná&quot; (Polná Brewery), the brewery where his mother and stepfather had met.

==Style==
Hrabal wrote in an expressive, highly visual style. He affected the use of long sentences; his works &quot;Dancing Lessons for the Advanced in Age&quot; (1964) and &quot;Vita Nuova&quot; (1987) consist entirely of one single sentence. Political quandaries and the accompanying moral ambiguities are recurrent themes in his works. Many of Hrabal&#x27;s characters are portrayed as &quot;wise fools&quot; — simpletons with occasional inadvertently profound thoughts — who are also given to coarse humour, lewdness, and a determination to survive and enjoy life despite harsh circumstances they found themselves in.

Much of the impact of Hrabal&#x27;s writing derives from his juxtaposition of the beauty and cruelty found in everyday life. Vivid depictions of pain human beings casually inflict on animals (as in the scene where families of mice are caught in a paper compactor) symbolise the pervasiveness of cruelty among human beings. His characterisations also can be comic, giving his prose a baroque or mediaeval tinge. He is known for his &quot;comic, slightly surreal tales about poor workers, eccentrics, failures, and nonconformists&quot;; his early stories are about &quot;social misfits and happily disreputable people&quot;.

Alongside fellow satirists Jaroslav Hašek, Karel Čapek and Milan Kundera, Hrabal is often described as one of the greatest Czech writers of the 20th century. Author Ewa Mazierska compared his works to Ladislav Grosman&#x27;s, in that his literary works typically contained a mixture of comedy and tragedy. His works have been translated into 27 languages.

<doc id="65131" wikidata="Q157128" url="?curid=65131" title="Elysium">
<text>Elysium (), otherwise known as the Elysian Fields (, &quot;Ēlýsion pedíon&quot;), Elysian Plains or Elysian Realm, is a conception of the afterlife that developed over time and was maintained by some Greek religious and philosophical sects and cults. It was initially separated from the Greek underworld – the realm of Hades. Only mortals related to the gods and other heroes could be admitted past the river Styx. Later, the conception of who could enter was expanded to include those chosen by the gods, the righteous, and the heroic. They would remain at the Elysian Fields after death, to live a blessed and happy afterlife, and indulge in whatever they had enjoyed in life.

The Elysian Fields were, according to Homer, located on the western edge of the Earth by the stream of Oceanus. In the time of the Greek poet Hesiod, Elysium would also be known as the &quot;Fortunate Isles&quot;, or the &quot;Isles (or Islands) of the Blessed&quot;, located in the western ocean at the end of the earth. The Isles of the Blessed would be reduced to a single island by the Theban poet Pindar, describing it as having shady parks, with residents indulging in athletic and musical pastimes.

The ruler of Elysium varies from author to author: Pindar and Hesiod name Cronus as the ruler, while the poet Homer in the &quot;Odyssey&quot; describes fair-haired Rhadamanthus dwelling there. &quot;The Isle of the Blessed&quot; is also featured in the 2nd-century comedic novel &quot;A True Story&quot; by Lucian of Samosata.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;Elysium&quot; derives via Latin from the Ancient Greek &quot;Ēlysion (pedion)&quot; &quot;Elysian (field)&quot;, ultimately of unknown origin. Eustathius of Thessalonica associated the word &quot;Elysion&quot; () with &quot;alyousas&quot; (itself from the verb &quot;alyō&quot;, &quot;to be deeply stirred from joy&quot;) or from &quot;alytōs&quot;, synonymous of (, &quot;incorruptible&quot;), referring to souls&#x27; life in this place. Another suggestion is from the stem &quot;elyth-&quot;, itself from (&quot;to come&quot;).

==Classical literature==

In Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Elysium is described as a paradise:
The Greek poet Hesiod refers to the &quot;Isles of the Blest&quot; in his didactic poem &quot;Works and Days&quot;. In his book &quot;Greek Religion&quot;, Walter Burkert notes the connection with the motif of far-off Dilmun: &quot;Thus Achilles is transported to the White Isle and becomes the Ruler of the Black Sea, and Diomedes becomes the divine lord of an Adriatic island&quot;.

Writing in the 5th century BCE, Pindar&#x27;s &quot;Odes&quot; describes the reward waiting for those living a righteous life:
In Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, Aeneas, like Heracles and Odysseus before him, travels to the underworld. Virgil describes those who will travel to Elysium, and those who will travel to Tartarus:

Virgil goes on to describe an encounter in Elysium between Aeneas and his father Anchises. Virgil&#x27;s Elysium knows perpetual spring and shady groves, with its own sun and lit by its own stars: &quot;solemque suum, sua sidera norunt&quot;.

In the Greek historian Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Sertorius&quot;, Elysium is described as:

Diodorus, in his first book, suggested that the Elysian fields which were much celebrated in ancient Greek poetry, corresponded to the beautiful plains in the neighborhood of Memphis which contained the tombs of that capital city of Egypt. He further intimated that the Greek prophet Orpheus composed his fables about the afterlife when he traveled to Egypt and saw the customs of the Egyptians regarding the rites of the dead.

==Post-classical literature==
Elysium as a pagan expression for paradise would eventually pass into usage by early Christian writers.

In Dante&#x27;s epic &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;, Elysium is mentioned as the abode of the blessed in the lower world; mentioned in connection with the meeting of Aeneas with the shade of Anchises in the Elysian Fields.
In the Renaissance, the heroic population of the Elysian Fields tended to outshine its formerly dreary pagan reputation; the Elysian Fields borrowed some of the bright allure of paradise. In Paris, the Champs-Élysées retain their name of the Elysian Fields, first applied in the late 16th century to a formerly rural outlier beyond the formal parterre gardens behind the royal French palace of the Tuileries.

After the Renaissance, an even cheerier Elysium evolved for some poets. Sometimes it is imagined as a place where heroes have continued their interests from their lives. Others suppose it is a location filled with feasting, sport, song; Joy is the &quot;daughter of Elysium&quot; in Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;. The poet Heinrich Heine explicitly parodied Schiller&#x27;s sentiment in referring to the Jewish Sabbath food cholent as the &quot;daughter of Elysium&quot; in his poem &quot;Princess Shabbat&quot;. 

Christian and classical attitudes to the afterlife are contrasted by Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot; saying, &quot;This word &#x27;damnation&#x27; terrifies not me, For I confound hell in elysium.&quot;

In Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Twelfth Night&quot; when Viola says &quot;My brother he is in Elysium&quot;, she and Elizabethan audiences understood this as Paradise. In Mozart&#x27;s &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; Papageno compares being in Elysium to winning his ideal woman: &quot;Des Lebens als Weiser mich freun, Und wie im Elysium sein.&quot; (&quot;Enjoy life as a wiseman, And feel like I&#x27;m in Elysium.&quot;)

Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; &quot;Don Quixote&quot; describes Dulcinea del Toboso as &quot;beauty superhuman, since all the impossible and fanciful attributes of beauty which the poets apply to their ladies are verified in her; for her hairs are gold, her forehead Elysian fields&quot;.

In John Ford&#x27;s 1633 tragedy &quot;&#x27;Tis Pity She&#x27;s a Whore&quot; Giovanni seals his requited love for his sister Annabella, stating &quot;And I&#x27;de not change it for the best to come: A life of pleasure in Elyzium&quot;.

==Modern influence==

The term and concept of Elysium has had influence in modern popular culture; references to Elysium can be found in literature, art, film, and music. Examples include the New Orleans neighbourhood of Elysian Fields in Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; as the déclassé purgatory where Blanche Dubois lives with Stanley and Stella Kowalski. New Orleans&#x27; Elysian Fields also provides the second-act setting of Elmer Rice&#x27;s &quot;The Adding Machine&quot; and the musical adaptation. In his poem &quot;Middlesex&quot;, John Betjeman describes how a few hedges &quot;Keep alive our lost Elysium – rural Middlesex again&quot;. In his poem &quot;An Old Haunt&quot;, Hugh McFadden sets an Elysian scene in Dublin&#x27;s St. Stephen&#x27;s Green park &quot;Very slowly solitude slips round me in St. Stephen&#x27;s Green. I rest: see pale salmon clouds blossom. I&#x27;m back in the fields of Elysium&quot;. In &quot;Spring and All&quot;, William Carlos Williams describes a dying woman&#x27;s &quot;elysian slobber/upon/the folded handkerchief&quot;.

The &quot;Champs-Élysées&quot; in Paris is French for &quot;Elysian Fields&quot;. The nearby Élysée Palace houses the President of the French Republic, for which reason &quot;l&#x27;Élysée&quot; frequently appears as a metonym for the French presidency, similar to how &quot;the White House&quot; can metonymically refer to the American presidency, and &quot;No.10 Downing Street&quot; the British prime minister. &quot;Elysium&quot; and &quot;Elysian&quot; are also used for numerous other names all over the world - examples include Elysian Fields, Hoboken, New Jersey; Elysian Park, Los Angeles; Elysian Valley, Los Angeles, California; Elysian, Minnesota; and Elysian Fields, Texas.

In Siegfried Sassoon&#x27;s &quot;Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man&quot;, Sassoon writes &quot;The air was Elysian with early summer&quot;. Its use in this context could be prolepsis, as the British countryside he is describing would become the burial ground of his dead comrades and heroes from World War I.

Elysium is referenced in the Schiller poem which inspired Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; (9th symphony, 4th movement) - notably in the excerpt used as the European Anthem. Elysium is also referenced in Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; (&quot;The Magic Flute&quot;). It is in Act II when Papageno is feeling very melancholy because he does not have a sweetheart or wife and he is drunk singing the song &quot;Ein Mädchen oder Weibchen&quot; (A Girl or a Wife).

The 2012 opera &quot;Dolls of New Albion&quot;, written by Paul Shapera, and its sequels, reference Elysium as an afterlife somewhat accessible to the living, though the living in Elysium are hunted by horrid creatures who guard Elysium.

===Books===
In David Gemmell&#x27;s Parmennion series (&quot;Lion of Macedon&quot; and &quot;Dark Prince&quot;) and his Troy trilogy, his characters refer to Elysium as the &quot;Hall of Heroes&quot;.

In Masami Kurumada&#x27;s mythologically themed &quot;Saint Seiya&quot; comic books, the Elysium is the setting of the final chapters of the &quot;Hades&quot; arc. In it, the Saints, the warriors of Athena&#x27;s army, traverse the Underworld to defeat its ruler, the ruthless Hades and rescue their kidnapped goddess. The Saints discover that the only way to kill Hades is to destroy his true body, which has rested in Elysium since the ages of myth. The Saints then invade Elysium, which Kurumada depicts as described in Greek mythology, and carry on their mission after a difficult battle with the deity.

In the novel, &quot;This Ruler&quot;, the story takes place at Elysium Hills High School. It is a reference to the mythology that surrounds American education and in particular high school. It also alludes to the teenagers, in the book, being Greek heroes.

===Film and television===
* In &quot;&quot; and its spin-off &quot;&quot;, the actual Elysian Fields appear several times as a happy afterlife, with the families of the title characters dwelling there; Heaven appears as a separate location in the same universe.
* The 2013 dystopian film &quot;Elysium&quot;, starring Matt Damon, used the name Elysium to describe the orbital space station of luxury that the rich live on in contrast to the ravaged Earth that the poor live on.

===Video games===
Elysium appears in the &quot;Fate of Atlantis&quot; DLC of the 2018 video game, &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Odyssey&quot;. In the first part of this DLC, &quot;The Fields of Elysium&quot;, the misthios travels to Elysium which is ruled by members of the precursor civilisation known as the Isu which were then worshipped as the gods of the Greek pantheon.

In 2021, the video game &quot;Honkai Impact 3rd&quot; added a roguelike gameplay mode called Elysian Realm. The player follows the character of Raiden Mei as she visits the Realm, known as the underworld where the memories of the last thirteen Flame-Chasers of the Previous Era rest.

==Honours==
Elysian Beach in Antarctica and Elysium Mons on Mars are named after the Elysian Fields, as is the aforementioned &quot;avenue des Champs-Élysées&quot;.

<text>An inverted repeat (or IR) is a single stranded sequence of nucleotides followed downstream by its reverse complement. The intervening sequence of nucleotides between the initial sequence and the reverse complement can be any length including zero. For example, is an inverted repeat sequence. When the intervening length is zero, the composite sequence is a palindromic sequence.

Both inverted repeats and direct repeats constitute types of nucleotide sequences that occur repetitively. These repeated DNA sequences often range from a pair of nucleotides to a whole gene, while the proximity of the repeat sequences varies between widely dispersed and simple tandem arrays. The short tandem repeat sequences may exist as just a few copies in a small region to thousands of copies dispersed all over the genome of most eukaryotes. Repeat sequences with about 10–100 base pairs are known as minisatellites, while shorter repeat sequences having mostly 2–4 base pairs are known as microsatellites. The most common repeats include the dinucleotide repeats, which have the bases AC on one DNA strand, and GT on the complementary strand. Some elements of the genome with unique sequences function as exons, introns and regulatory DNA. Though the most familiar loci of the repetitive sequences are the centromere and the telomere, a large portion of the repeated sequences in the genome are found among the noncoding DNA.

Inverted repeats have a number of important biological functions. They define the boundaries in transposons and indicate regions capable of self-complementary base pairing (regions within a single sequence which can base pair with each other). These properties play an important role in genome instability and contribute not only to cellular evolution and genetic diversity but also to mutation and disease. In order to study these effects in detail, a number of programs and databases have been developed to assist in discovery and annotation of inverted repeats in various genomes.

==Understanding inverted repeats==

===Example of an inverted repeat===
Beginning with this initial sequence:

The complement created by base pairing is:

The reverse complement is:

And, the inverted repeat sequence is:

&quot;nnnnnn&quot; represents any number of intervening nucleotides.

===Vs. direct repeat===
A direct repeat occurs when a sequence is repeated with the same pattern downstream. There is no inversion and no reverse complement associated with a direct repeat. The nucleotide sequence written in bold characters signifies the repeated sequence. It may or may not have intervening nucleotides.
:::
Linguistically, a typical direct repeat is comparable to rhyming, as in &quot;time on a dime&quot;.

===Vs. tandem repeat===
A direct repeat with &quot;no&quot; intervening nucleotides between the initial sequence and its downstream copy is a Tandem repeat. The nucleotide sequence written in bold characters signifies the repeated sequence.
:::
Linguistically, a typical tandem repeat is comparable to stuttering, or deliberately repeated words, as in &quot;bye-bye&quot;.

===Vs. palindrome===

An inverted repeat sequence with &quot;no&quot; intervening nucleotides between the initial sequence and its downstream reverse complement is a palindrome.     EXAMPLE:
        Step 1: start with an inverted repeat: 
        Step 2: remove intervening nucleotides: 
        This resulting sequence is palindromic because it is the reverse complement of itself.
:::   test sequence (from Step 2 with intervening nucleotides removed)
:::   complement of test sequence
:::   reverse complement     This is the same as the test sequence above, and thus, it is a palindrome.

==Biological features and functionality==
===Conditions that favor synthesis===
The diverse genome-wide repeats are derived from transposable elements, which are now understood to &quot;jump&quot; about different genomic locations, without transferring their original copies. Subsequent shuttling of the same sequences over numerous generations ensures their multiplicity throughout the genome. The limited recombination of the sequences between two distinct sequence elements known as conservative site-specific recombination (CSSR) results in inversions of the DNA segment, based on the arrangement of the recombination recognition sequences on the donor DNA and recipient DNA. Again, the orientation of two of the recombining sites within the donor DNA molecule relative to the asymmetry of the intervening DNA cleavage sequences, known as the crossover region, is pivotal to the formation of either inverted repeats or direct repeats. Thus, recombination occurring at a pair of inverted sites will invert the DNA sequence between the two sites. Very stable chromosomes have been observed with comparatively fewer numbers of inverted repeats than direct repeats, suggesting a relationship between chromosome stability and the number of repeats.
===Regions where presence is obligatory===
Terminal inverted repeats have been observed in the DNA of various eukaryotic transposons, even though their source remains unknown. Inverted repeats are principally found at the origins of replication of cell organism and organelles that range from phage plasmids, mitochondria, and eukaryotic viruses to mammalian cells. The replication origins of the phage G4 and other related phages comprise a segment of nearly 139 nucleotide bases that include three inverted repeats that are essential for replication priming.

===In the genome===
To a large extent, portions of nucleotide repeats are quite often observed as part of rare DNA combinations. The three main repeats which are largely found in particular DNA constructs include the closely precise homopurine-homopyrimidine inverted repeats, which is otherwise referred to as H palindromes, a common occurrence in triple helical H conformations that may comprise either the TAT or CGC nucleotide triads. The others could be described as long inverted repeats having the tendency to produce hairpins and cruciform, and finally direct tandem repeats, which commonly exist in structures described as slipped-loop, cruciform and left-handed Z-DNA.

===Common in different organisms===
Past studies suggest that repeats are a common feature of eukaryotes unlike the prokaryotes and archaea. Other reports suggest that irrespective of the comparative shortage of repeat elements in prokaryotic genomes, they nevertheless contain hundreds or even thousands of large repeats. Current genomic analysis seem to suggest the existence of a large excess of perfect inverted repeats in many prokaryotic genomes as compared to eukaryotic genomes.

For quantification and comparison of inverted repeats between several species, namely on archaea, see 

===Inverted repeats in pseudoknots===
Pseudoknots are common structural motifs found in RNA. They are formed by two nested stem-loops such that the stem of one structure is formed from the loop of the other. There are multiple folding topologies among pseudoknots and great variation in loop lengths, making them a structurally diverse group.

Inverted repeats are a key component of pseudoknots as can be seen in the illustration of a naturally occurring pseudoknot found in the human telomerase RNA component. Four different sets of inverted repeats are involved in this structure. Sets 1 and 2 are the stem of stem-loop A and are part of the loop for stem-loop B. Similarly, sets 3 and 4 are the stem for stem-loop B and are part of the loop for stem-loop A.

Pseudoknots play a number of different roles in biology. The telomerase pseudoknot in the illustration is critical to that enzyme&#x27;s activity. The ribozyme for the &quot;hepatitis delta virus (HDV)&quot; folds into a double-pseudoknot structure and self-cleaves its circular genome to produce a single-genome-length RNA. Pseudoknots also play a role in programmed ribosomal frameshifting found in some viruses and required in the replication of retroviruses.

===In riboswitches===
Inverted repeats play an important role in riboswitches, which are RNA regulatory elements that control the expression of genes that produce the mRNA, of which they are part. A simplified example of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN) riboswitch is shown in the illustration. This riboswitch exists in the mRNA transcript and has several stem-loop structures upstream from the coding region. However, only the key stem-loops are shown in the illustration, which has been greatly simplified to help show the role of the inverted repeats. There are multiple inverted repeats in this riboswitch as indicated in green (yellow background) and blue (orange background). 

In the absence of FMN, the Anti-termination structure is the preferred conformation for the mRNA transcript. It is created by base-pairing of the inverted repeat region circled in red. When FMN is present, it may bind to the loop and prevent formation of the Anti-termination structure. This allows two different sets of inverted repeats to base-pair and form the Termination structure. The stem-loop on the 3&#x27; end is a transcriptional terminator because the sequence immediately following it is a string of uracils (U). If this stem-loop forms (due to the presence of FMN) as the growing RNA strand emerges from the RNA polymerase complex, it will create enough structural tension to cause the RNA strand to dissociate and thus terminate transcription. The dissociation occurs easily because the base-pairing between the U&#x27;s in the RNA and the A&#x27;s in the template strand are the weakest of all base-pairings. Thus, at higher concentration levels, FMN down-regulates its own transcription by increasing the formation of the termination structure.

==Mutations and disease==
Inverted repeats are often described as &quot;hotspots&quot; of eukaryotic and prokaryotic genomic instability. Long inverted repeats are deemed to greatly influence the stability of the genome of various organisms. This is exemplified in &quot;E. coli&quot;, where genomic sequences with long inverted repeats are seldom replicated, but rather deleted with rapidity. Again, the long inverted repeats observed in yeast greatly favor recombination within the same and adjacent chromosomes, resulting in an equally very high rate of deletion. Finally, a very high rate of deletion and recombination were also observed in mammalian chromosomes regions with inverted repeats. Reported differences in the stability of genomes of interrelated organisms are always an indication of a disparity in inverted repeats. The instability results from the tendency of inverted repeats to fold into hairpin- or cruciform-like DNA structures. These special structures can hinder or confuse DNA replication and other genomic activities. Thus, inverted repeats lead to special configurations in both RNA and DNA that can ultimately cause mutations and disease.

The illustration shows an inverted repeat undergoing cruciform extrusion. DNA in the region of the inverted repeat unwinds and then recombines, forming a four-way junction with two stem-loop structures. The cruciform structure occurs because the inverted repeat sequences self-pair to each other on their own strand.

Extruded cruciforms can lead to frameshift mutations when a DNA sequence has inverted repeats in the form of a palindrome combined with regions of direct repeats on either side. During transcription, slippage and partial dissociation of the polymerase from the template strand can lead to both deletion and insertion mutations. Deletion occurs when a portion of the unwound template strand forms a stem-loop that gets &quot;skipped&quot; by the transcription machinery. Insertion occurs when a stem-loop forms in a dissociated portion of the nascent (newly synthesized) strand causing a portion of the template strand to be transcribed twice.

=== Antithrombin deficiency from a point mutation ===
Imperfect inverted repeats can lead to mutations through intrastrand and interstrand switching. The antithrombin III gene&#x27;s coding region is an example of an imperfect inverted repeat as shown in the figure on the right.
The stem-loop structure forms with a bump at the bottom because the G and T do not pair up. A strand switch event could result in the G (in the bump) being replaced by an A which removes the &quot;imperfection&quot; in the inverted repeat and provides a stronger stem-loop structure. However, the replacement also creates a point mutation converting the GCA codon to ACA. If the strand switch event is followed by a second round of DNA replication, the mutation may become fixed in the genome and lead to disease. Specifically, the missense mutation would lead to a defective gene and a deficiency in antithrombin which could result in the development of venous thromboembolism (blood clots within a vein).

=== Osteogenesis imperfecta from a frameshift mutation ===
Mutations in the collagen gene can lead to the disease Osteogenesis Imperfecta, which is characterized by brittle bones. In the illustration, a stem-loop formed from an imperfect inverted repeat is mutated with a thymine (T) nucleotide insertion as a result of an inter- or intrastrand switch. The addition of the T creates a base-pairing &quot;match up&quot; with the adenine (A) that was previously a &quot;bump&quot; on the left side of the stem. While this addition makes the stem stronger and perfects the inverted repeat, it also creates a frameshift mutation in the nucleotide sequence which alters the reading frame and will result in an incorrect expression of the gene.
==Programs and databases==
The following list provides information and external links to various programs and databases for inverted repeats:
*non-B DB A Database for Integrated Annotations and Analysis of non-B DNA Forming Motifs. This database is provided by The Advanced Biomedical Computing Center (ABCC) at then Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNLCR). It covers the A-DNA and Z-DNA conformations otherwise known as &quot;non-B DNAs&quot; because they are not the more common B-DNA form of a right-handed Watson-Crick double-helix. These &quot;non-B DNAs&quot; include left-handed Z-DNA, cruciform, triplex, tetraplex and hairpin structures. Searches can be performed on a variety of &quot;repeat types&quot; (including inverted repeats) and on several species.

<text>Baroness Karen Christenze von Blixen-Finecke (born Dinesen; 17 April 1885 – 7 September 1962) was a Danish author who wrote in Danish and English. She is also known under her pen names Isak Dinesen, used in English-speaking countries; Tania Blixen, used in German-speaking countries; Osceola, and Pierre Andrézel.

Blixen is best known for &quot;Out of Africa&quot;, an account of her life while in Kenya, and for one of her stories, &quot;Babette&#x27;s Feast&quot;. Both have been adapted as films and each won Academy Awards. She is also noted, particularly in Denmark and the US, for her &quot;Seven Gothic Tales&quot;. Among her later stories are &quot;Winter&#x27;s Tales&quot; (1942), &quot;Last Tales&quot; (1957), &quot;Anecdotes of Destiny&quot; (1958) and &quot;Ehrengard&quot; (1963). The latter was adapted as a romantic comedy film &quot;Ehrengard: The Art of Seduction&quot;, directed by Bille August and in association with Netflix, which released it on streaming in late 2023.

Blixen was considered several times for the Nobel Prize in Literature, but did not receive it because judges were reportedly concerned about showing favoritism to Scandinavian writers, according to Danish reports.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===

Karen Dinesen was born in Rungstedlund, north of Copenhagen. Her father, Wilhelm Dinesen (1845–1895), was a writer, army officer, and politician. He served in the 1864 war by Denmark against Prussia, and also joined the French army against Prussia. He later wrote about the Paris Commune. He was from a wealthy family of Jutland landowners closely connected to the monarchy, the established church and conservative politics. He was elected as Member of Parliament. 

Her mother, Ingeborg Westenholz (1856–1939), came from a wealthy Unitarian bourgeois merchant family of ship owners. Karen Dinesen was the second oldest in a family of three sisters and two brothers. Her younger brother, Thomas Dinesen, served in the First World War and earned the Victoria Cross. Karen was known to her friends as &quot;Tanne&quot;.

Dinesen&#x27;s early years were strongly influenced by her father&#x27;s relaxed manner and his love of the outdoor life and hunting. He wrote throughout his life and his memoir, &quot;Boganis Jagtbreve&quot; (Letters from the Hunt) became a minor classic in Danish literature. 
While in his mid-20s, her father lived among the Chippewa Indians in Wisconsin (August 1872 to December 1873), and fathered a daughter. 

On returning to Denmark, he suffered from syphilis which resulted in bouts of deep depression. He conceived a child out of wedlock with his maid Anna Rasmussen, and was devastated because he had promised his mother-in-law to remain faithful to his wife. He hanged himself on 28 March 1895 when Karen was nine years old.

Karen Dinesen&#x27;s life at Rungstedlund changed significantly after her father&#x27;s death. From the age of 10 years, her life was dominated by her mother&#x27;s Westenholz family. Unlike her brothers, who attended school, she was educated at home by her maternal grandmother and by her aunt, Mary B. Westenholz. They brought her up in the staunch Unitarian tradition. Her Aunt Bess had significant influence on Dinesen. They engaged in lively discussions and correspondence on women&#x27;s rights and relationships between men and women.

During her early years, she spent part of her time at her mother&#x27;s family home, the Mattrup seat farm near Horsens. In later years she visited Folehavegård, an estate near Hørsholm that had belonged to her father&#x27;s family. Longing for the freedom she had enjoyed when her father was alive, she found some satisfaction in telling her younger sister Ellen hair-raising good-night stories, partly inspired by Danish folk tales and Icelandic sagas. In 1905, these led to her &quot;Grjotgard Ålvesøn og Aud&quot;, in which her literary talent began to emerge. Around this time, she also published fiction in Danish periodicals under the pseudonym Osceola, the name of her father&#x27;s dog, which she had often walked in her father&#x27;s company.

In 1898, Dinesen and her two sisters spent a year in Switzerland, where she learned to speak French. In 1902, she attended Charlotte Sode&#x27;s art school in Copenhagen before continuing her studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts under Viggo Johansen from 1903 to 1906. In her mid-twenties, she also visited Paris, London and Rome on study trips.

While still young, Dinesen spent many of her holidays with her paternal cousin&#x27;s family, the Blixen-Fineckes, in Skåne in the south of Sweden. She fell in love with the dashing equestrian baron Hans, but he did not reciprocate. 

She decided to accept the favours of his twin brother, Baron Bror Blixen-Finecke, and they announced their engagement on 23 December 1912, to the family&#x27;s surprise. Given the difficulties both were experiencing in settling in Denmark, the family suggested they should move abroad. Karen&#x27;s uncle, Aage Westenholz (1859–1935) who had made a fortune in Siam, suggested they should go to Kenya to start a coffee farm. He and his sister Ingeborg Dinesen (Karen Dinesen&#x27;s mother) invested 150,000 Danish crowns in the venture. Early in 1913, Bror left for Kenya. He was followed by his fiancée Karen in December 1913.

===Life in Kenya, 1913–1931===
Soon after Karen Dinesen arrived in Kenya, which at the time was part of British East Africa, she and Blixen were married in Mombasa on 14 January 1914. After her marriage, she became known as Baroness Blixen and she used the title until her then ex-husband remarried in 1929. Bror had attended agricultural college at Alnarp and then managed the Stjetneholm farm within the Nasbyholm estate. During her early years, Karen spent part of her time at her mother&#x27;s family home, the Mattrup seat farm near Horsens. Karen and Bror planned to raise cattle on their farm, but eventually they became convinced that coffee would be more profitable. The Karen Coffee Company was established by their uncle, Aage Westerholz, who chose the name after his daughter Karen, Blixen&#x27;s cousin, rather than to create an association with Karen Blixen. The couple soon established their first farm, Mbagathi, in the Great Lakes area.

During First World War fighting between the Germans and the British in East Africa, Bror served in Lord Delamere&#x27;s patrols along Kenya&#x27;s border with German-Tanganyika and Karen helped transport supplies. The war led to a shortage of workers and supplies. Nevertheless, in 1916, the Karen Coffee Company purchased a larger farm, Mbogani, near the Ngong Hills to the south–west of Nairobi. The property covered of land: were used for a coffee plantation, were used by the natives for grazing, and of virgin forest were left untouched.

The land was not well-suited for coffee cultivation, given its high elevation. The couple hired local workers: most were Kikuyu who lived on the farmlands at the time of the couple&#x27;s arrival, but there were also Wakamba, Kavirondo, Swahili, and Masai. Initially, Bror worked the farm, but it soon became evident that he had little interest in it and preferred to leave running the farm to Blixen while he went on safari. For the first time, English became the language she used daily. About the couple&#x27;s early life in the African Great Lakes region, Karen Blixen later wrote,Here at long last one was in a position not to give a damn for all conventions, here was a new kind of freedom which until then one had only found in dreams!

Blixen and her husband were quite different in education and temperament, and Bror Blixen was unfaithful to his wife.

According to Peter Capstick, &quot;It was not long after Blixen and his wife settled on their farm that he started womanizing.&quot; Capstick goes on to say, &quot;His forays into town and his often wild socializing at the Muthaiga Club, coupled with a legendary indiscipline when it came to money and honoring his debts, soon gave the charming Swede a notorious reputation.&quot;

As a consequence, she was diagnosed with syphilis according to her biographer Judith Thurman. She herself attributed her symptoms, in a letter to her brother Thomas, to syphilis acquired at 29 years old from her husband toward the end of their first year of marriage in 1915. However, later in life, her medical records do not support that diagnosis. She had been locally prescribed mercury and arsenic, a treatment for the disease in her time. It is now believed that some of her later symptoms were the result of heavy metal poisoning.

At her farm, she also used to take care of local sick persons, including those suffering from fever, variola, meningitis and typhus.

She returned to Denmark in June 1915 for treatment which proved successful. Although Blixen&#x27;s illness was eventually cured (some uncertainty exists), it created medical anguish for years to come.
On 5 April 1918, Bror and Karen were introduced at the Muthaiga Club to
the English big game hunter Denys Finch Hatton (1887–1931). Soon afterwards he was assigned to military service in Egypt.

By 1919, the marriage had run into difficulties, causing her husband to request a divorce in 1920. Bror was dismissed as the farm manager by their uncle, Aage Westenholz, chair of the Karen Coffee Company, and Karen took over its management in 1921.

On his return to Kenya after the Armistice, Finch Hatton developed a close friendship with Karen and Bror. He left Africa again in 1920.

Against her wishes, Bror and Karen separated in 1921.

Finch Hatton often travelled back and forth between Africa and England, and visited Karen occasionally. He returned in 1922, investing in a land development company. After her separation from her husband she and Finch Hatton had developed a close friendship, which eventually became a long-term love affair. In a letter to her brother Thomas in 1924, she wrote: &quot;I believe that for all time and eternity I am bound to Denys, to love the ground he walks upon, to be happy beyond words when he is here, and to suffer worse than death many times when he leaves...&quot; But other letters in her collections show that the relationship was unstable, and that Karen&#x27;s increasing dependence upon Finch Hatton, who was intensely independent, was an issue.

Karen and Bror were officially divorced in 1925. Karen would go to Government House where she had befriended Joan Grigg who was the bored wife of the governor. Grigg would in time create a charity to create hospitals in Kenya.

Finch Hatton moved into her house, made Blixen&#x27;s farmhouse his home base between 1926 and 1931 and began leading safaris for wealthy sportsmen. Among his clients was Edward, Prince of Wales (the future Edward VIII). On safari with his clients, he died in the crash of his de Havilland Gipsy Moth biplane in March 1931. 

Karen Blixen wrote about their last meeting and subsequent parting.

&quot;When he had started in his car for the aerodrome in Nairobi, and had turned down the drive, he came back to look for a volume of poems, that he had given to me and now wanted on his journey. He stood with one foot on the running-board of the car, and a finger in the book, reading out to me a poem we had been discussing.

&#x27;Here are your grey geese,&#x27; he said.

&quot;I saw grey geese flying over the flatlands&quot;

&quot;Wild geese vibrant in the high air –&quot;

&quot;Unswerving from horizon to horizon&quot;

&quot;With their soul stiffened out in their throats –&quot;

&quot;And the grey whiteness of them ribboning the enormous skies&quot;

&quot;And the spokes of the sun over the crumpled hills.&quot;

Then he drove away for good, waving his arm to me.&quot;

At the same time, the failure of the coffee plantation, as a result of mismanagement, the height of the farm, drought and the falling price of coffee caused by the worldwide economic depression, forced Blixen to abandon her estate. The family corporation sold the land to a residential developer, and Blixen returned to Denmark in August 1931 to live with her mother. In the Second World War, she helped Jews escape out of German-occupied Denmark. She remained in Rungstedlund for the rest of her life.

===Life as a writer===
While still in Kenya, Blixen had written to her brother Thomas, &quot;I have begun to do what we brothers and sisters do when we don&#x27;t know what else to resort to, I have started to write a book. ... I have been writing in English because I thought it would be more profitable.&quot; 
Upon returning to Denmark, aged 46, she continued writing in earnest. Though her first book, &quot;Seven Gothic Tales&quot;, was completed in 1933, she had difficulty finding a publisher and used her brother&#x27;s contacts with Dorothy Canfield to help. The book was published in the United States in 1934 under the pseudonym Isak Dinesen, though the publisher refused to give Blixen an advance and discouraged the use of a pseudonym. When it was chosen as a Book-of-the-Month Club selection, sales skyrocketed. This first book, highly enigmatic and more metaphoric than Gothic, won wide recognition in the United States, and publication of the book in the United Kingdom and Denmark followed, though with difficulty. Unable to find a translator she was satisfied with, Blixen prepared the Danish versions herself, though they are not translations, but rather versions of the stories with differing details. Blixen&#x27;s explanation for the difference was that she &quot;very much wanted it to be published in Danish as an original Danish book, and not in any — no matter how good — translation&quot;. The Danish critics were not enthusiastic about the book and were annoyed, according to Blixen, that it had first been published abroad. Blixen never again published a book in English first. All her later books were either published first in Danish, or published simultaneously in Danish and English.

Her second book, now the best known of her works, &quot;Out of Africa&quot;, was published in 1937. Its success firmly established her reputation. Having learned from her previous experience, Blixen published the book first in Denmark and the United Kingdom, and then in the United States. Garnering another Book-of-the-Month Club choice, Blixen was assured of not only sales for this new work, but also renewed interest in &quot;Seven Gothic Tales&quot;. She was awarded the Tagea Brandt Rejselegat (a Danish prize for women in the arts or academic life) in 1939. The work brought attention from critics who were concerned not only with literary appraisal of the book, but also with defining Blixen&#x27;s intentions and morality. Post-colonial criticism has linked her with contemporary British writers and in some cases branded her as just another morally bankrupt white European aristocrat. Danish scholars have not typically made judgments about her morality, perhaps understanding that while colonial prejudices and elements of racism are inherent in the work, given the context and era, nevertheless her position as an outsider, a Dane and a woman makes evaluating her more complex. Some critics, including Carolyn Martin Shaw and Raoul Granqvist, have judged her to be a racist and a white supremacist, while other critics, such as Abdul R. JanMohamed, have recognized both her romanticized colonial attitudes and her understanding of colonial problems, as well as her concern and respect for African nationalists.

Five years after the publication of &quot;Out of Africa&quot;, Blixen published a collection of short stories called &quot;Winter&#x27;s Tales&quot; (1942; ). A departure from her previous Gothic works, the stories reflect the starkness of the times, occupation tinged with courage and pride, and hope for the future. The stories do not reflect resistance, but resilience, and explore the interdependence of opposites. She examines shame versus pride in &quot;The Heroine&quot;, cowardice and courage in &quot;The Pearls&quot;, master and servant in &quot;The Invincible Slave-Owners&quot;, and life versus death as well as freedom versus imprisonment in &quot;Peter and Rosa&quot;. In &quot;Sorrow-acre&quot;, the best-known story of the collection, Blixen explores victimization and oppression. Because of the war, she had to be creative about getting the manuscript published, travelling to Stockholm and meeting with employees at both the American and British embassies. The Americans were unable to ship personal items, but the British embassy agreed, shipping the document to her publisher in the United States. Blixen did not receive further communication about &quot;Winter&#x27;s Tales&quot; until after the war ended, when she received correspondence praising the stories from American troops who had read them in the &quot;Armed Services Editions&quot; during the conflict.

Blixen worked on a novel she called &quot;Albondocani&quot; for many years, hoping to produce a volume in the style of &quot;Les Hommes de bonne volonté&quot; by Jules Romains, with interwoven stories across several volumes. The main character, Harun al-Rashid, was taken from &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;. She worked on several collections at once, categorizing them according to their themes and whether she thought they were mostly to make money or literary. She jumped between writing the collections of stories for &quot;Albondocani&quot; to &quot;Anecdotes of Destiny&quot; to &quot;New Gothic Tales&quot; and &quot;New Winter&#x27;s Tales&quot;. Almost all of Blixen&#x27;s tales from the 1940s and 1950s follow a traditional style of storytelling, weaving Gothic themes such as incest and murder with myth and bewitchment as a means of exploring identity, morality and philosophy. Most also take place against the background of the 19th century or earlier periods. Concerning her deliberately old-fashioned style, Blixen mentioned in several interviews that she wanted to express a spirit that no longer existed in modern times, one of being rather than doing. Her narratives hover between skillfully crafted illusion and romanticism, with a keen knowledge of the preferred tastes of her audience. Blixen crafted her English tales in a more direct manner and her Danish tales in a 19th-century writing style which she felt would appeal more to them. Because she simultaneously worked on different collections, works written in this period were not published until almost a decade after they were originally written.

During World War II, when Denmark was occupied by the Germans, Blixen started her only full-length novel, the introspective tale &quot;The Angelic Avengers&quot;, under a French pseudonym, Pierre Andrezel, for the first and last time. Though it was written in Danish, she claimed that it was a translation of a French work written between the wars and denied being its author. The book was published in 1944 and nominated for a third Book-of-the-Month Club selection. Blixen initially did not want the book to be nominated, but eventually accepted the distinction. The horrors experienced by the young heroines have been interpreted as an allegory of Nazism, though Blixen also denied that interpretation, claiming instead that the novel was a distraction that had helped her to escape the feeling of being imprisoned by the war. In 1956, in an interview for &quot;The Paris Review&quot;, she finally acknowledged that she was the author of the novel, saying that it was her &quot;illegitimate child&quot;. Dorothy Canfield described &quot;The Angelic Avengers&quot; in her &quot;Book-of-the-Month Club News&quot; review as &quot;of superlatively fine literary quality, written with distinction in an exquisite style&quot;.

A collection of stories, &quot;Last Tales&quot; () was published in 1957, followed in 1958 by the collection &quot;Anecdotes of Destiny&quot; (). &quot;Last Tales&quot; included seven stories that Blixen had intended to be parts of &quot;Albondocani&quot;. It also included sections called &quot;New Gothic Tales&quot; and &quot;New Winter&#x27;s Tales&quot;. Blixen&#x27;s concept of the art of the story is perhaps most directly expressed in the stories &quot;The Blank Page&quot; and &quot;The Cardinal&#x27;s First Tale&quot; in &quot;Last Tales&quot;. These tales feature many innuendos, which Blixen employed to force her reader into participating in the creation of the story. She mixed obscure references with explicit observation. Her writing was not just a retelling of tales, however; it was a complex layering of clues and &quot;double entendres&quot; which force the reader to deduce Blixen&#x27;s intent and draw conclusions. The story, for Blixen, was vital to expression: it gives a recitation of experience, and simultaneously a potential vision of the possible.

Blixen planned for &quot;Anecdotes of Destiny&quot; to be a final part of the &quot;Last Tales&quot; in 1953, but as she prepared all the stories, she decided to publish &quot;Anecdotes&quot; as a separate volume. She wanted both books to appear simultaneously, but because of publication issues &quot;Anecdotes&quot; was delayed for another year. The most famous tale from &quot;Anecdotes&quot; is &quot;Babette&#x27;s Feast&quot;, about a chef who spends her entire 10,000-franc lottery prize to prepare a final spectacular gourmet meal. The story evaluates relationships and examines whether the austere but charitable life led by the sisters, in adherence to an ideal, is less true to faith than the passionate gift from the heart of their housekeeper. The story was reproduced in a film directed and written by Gabriel Axel, which was released in 1987, and won the Best Foreign Film Oscar in 1988.

In 1959, Blixen made her only trip to the United States. It was an extended trip spanning from January to April, and while the purpose was to complete a series of educational films and discussions for the Ford Foundation and Encyclopædia Britannica, Blixen intended to enjoy herself. She was the feature of a &quot;Life Magazine&quot; article in the edition of 19 January 1959 and attended two Broadway openings. Feted by the well-to-do of New York society, Blixen was invited to dine with socialites Babe Paley and Gloria Vanderbilt. She was photographed by Richard Avedon and Cecil Beaton, hosted by John Steinbeck at a cocktail party in her honor, and serenaded by Maria Callas. Nobel laureate Pearl Buck and poets E. E. Cummings and Marianne Moore came to see her, as well. When Blixen expressed a desire to meet Marilyn Monroe, the author Carson McCullers arranged a meeting with Monroe and her husband, the playwright Arthur Miller. Throughout the trip, Blixen played upon her crafted persona as a reclusive aristocrat and an outsider, but also that of an eccentric, who would eat only oysters and grapes, and drink only champagne. It was clear that she was ill, as it was reported that she was &quot;frail&quot; and &quot;weighed 63 pounds [28 kg]&quot; and she spent part of her time receiving &quot;intravenous infusions&quot;.

After returning to Denmark, Blixen resumed working, despite severe illness, finishing the African sketches &quot;Shadows on the Grass&quot; in 1960. The last of her works published during her lifetime, it was awarded her fifth selection as a Book-of-the-Month. A return-to-Africa memoir, &quot;Shadows&quot; explores the stereotypes and labels of Europeans and Africans, concluding that &quot;prejudices reveal more about the perceiver than the perceived&quot;. The book consists of four tales: &quot;Shadows on the Grass&quot;, which focuses on her Somali servant Farah; &quot;Faith is Revealed&quot;, which relays the importance of symbolism; &quot;The Great Gesture&quot;, which depicts medical issues in her community; and &quot;Echoes from the Hills&quot;, which evaluates her loneliness after leaving Africa and the tireless vigil her staff from Africa kept on her former home for many years.

===Illness and death===

When Blixen was diagnosed with syphilis in 1915, she was treated with mercury tablets. She took approximately 1 gram of mercury per day for almost a year according to some reports, while others show she did so for only a few months. She then spent time in Denmark for treatment and was given arsenic, which she continued to take in drop form as a treatment for the syphilis that she thought was the cause of her continued pain. Blixen had reported severe bouts of abdominal pain as early as 1921, while she was still in Kenya. Several well-known physicians and specialists of both internal medicine and neurology diagnosed her with third-stage chronic syphilis. Mogens Fog, who was Blixen&#x27;s neurologist, thought that her gastric problems were attributable to syphilis, in spite of the fact that blood and spinal fluid tests were negative. By the time she left Africa, Blixen was suffering from anemia, had jaundice and had overused arsenic. As clumps of her hair had begun to fall out, she took to wearing hats and turbans.

Although it was widely believed that syphilis continued to plague Blixen throughout her lifetime, extensive tests were unable to reveal evidence of syphilis in her system after 1925. Her writing prowess suggests that she did not suffer from the mental degeneration of late stages of syphilis. She did suffer a mild permanent loss of sensation in her legs that could be attributed to use of the arsenic-based anti-syphilis drug salvarsan. Her gastric pain was often called &quot;tropic dysentery&quot;, though no stool analyses were reported in her medical records. Concerned about gaining weight, Blixen took strong laxatives &quot;during her whole adult life&quot;, which after years of misuse affected her digestive system. She also was a heavy smoker, which when combined with her minimal food intake led to her developing a peptic ulcer.

In 1946 and 1955 the neurosurgeon Eduard Busch performed a lumbar sympathectomy on Blixen&#x27;s spinal cord, but her pain returned. In 1956 when she was diagnosed with the stomach ulcer, Professor Torben Knudtzon performed surgery at Copenhagen University Hospital, but by that time, she was in her seventies, and already in poor health. Over the next several years, she continued to suffer from dehydration and a lack of nutrition, which rendered her weak and led to four additional hospitalizations at the Central Hospital in Hillerød. Late in her treatment, she finally confessed her use of laxatives to her doctors. The source of her abdominal problems remains unknown. A 1995 report published by the Danish physician, Kaare Weismann, concluded that the cause of her chronic pain and ailment was likely heavy metal poisoning. A 2002 report by Søgaard in the &quot;Danish Medical History Journal&quot; (&quot;&quot;) attributed her misdiagnosis to a failure to communicate on both the part of Blixen and her doctors. As she didn&#x27;t tell them about her laxative misuse, and the physicians believed they were fighting syphilis, each missed the opportunity for effective treatment. Both Erik Münster and Weismann also recognized the lapse in communication, as had Blixen been treated with penicillin, which was available by the 1950s, syphilis would have been able to be ruled out.

It is also known that Blixen suffered from panic attacks, because she described them in her book &quot;Out of Africa&quot;. In her analysis of Blixen&#x27;s medical history, Donelson points out that Blixen wondered if her pain was psychosomatic and states that during Blixen&#x27;s lifetime her illnesses were rumored to be fabricated. Her publisher indicated that Blixen&#x27;s syphilis was a myth in private, but publicly, Blixen blamed syphilis for her chronic health issues. Donelson concluded: &quot;Whatever her belief about her illness, the disease suited the artist&#x27;s design for creating her own personal legend.&quot;

Unable to eat, Blixen died in 1962 at Rungstedlund, her family&#x27;s estate, at the age of 77, apparently of malnutrition. Others attribute her weight loss and eventual death to anorexia nervosa.

===Posthumous works===
Among Blixen&#x27;s posthumously published works are: &quot;Ehrengard&quot; (1962), &quot;Carnival: Entertainments and Posthumous Tales (1977)&quot;, &quot;Daguerreotypes, and Other Essays&quot; (1979) and &quot;Letters from Africa, 1914–31&quot; (1981). In the late 1960s, Orson Welles planned an anthology of Dinesen&#x27;s films, in which he intended to release &quot;The Heroine&quot;, &quot;The Deluge at Norderney&quot;, &quot;A Country Tale&quot;, and &quot;Full Moon&quot;. After a day of shooting film in Budapest on &quot;The Heroine&quot;, the project was canceled because his financier went bankrupt. &quot;The Immortal Story&quot; was adapted to film in 1968 by Welles and released simultaneously on French television and in theaters. Welles later attempted to film &quot;The Dreamers&quot;, but only a few scenes were ever completed. In 1982, Emidio Greco directed an Italian film, &quot;Ehrengard&quot;, based upon Blixen&#x27;s work of the same name, which was not released until 2002 due to financial complications. A second film adaptation, &quot;&quot;, was released in 2023, with creative input by Queen Margrethe II of Denmark.

==Legacy==
===Awards and honors===
For her literary accomplishments, Blixen was awarded the Danish Holberg Medal in 1949, the Ingenio et Arti medal in 1952, granted the inaugural Hans Christian Andersen Scholarship of the Danish Writers Association in 1955 and received the Henrik Pontoppidan Memorial Foundation Grant in 1959. Karen Blixen was proposed by the Swedish Academy&#x27;s Nobel committee to be awarded the 1959 Nobel Prize in Literature, but committee member Eyvind Johnson (who himself would accept the prize fifteen years later) opposed a prize to Blixen arguing that Scandinavians were overrepresentated among Nobel prize laureates in literature, and the members of the Academy surprisingly voted for a prize to the Italian poet Salvatore Quasimodo instead. Kjell Espmark and Peter Englund, members of the Swedish Academy, have both described this decision as &quot;a mistake&quot;, with Espmark arguing that Blixen is likely to have been better accepted internationally than other Scandinavian Nobel laureates and that the Academy missed an opportunity to correct the underrepresention of female laureates. When Hemingway won the prize in 1954, he stated that Bernard Berenson, Carl Sandburg and Blixen deserved the prize more than he did Although never awarded the prize, she finished in third place behind Graham Greene in 1961, the year Ivo Andrić was awarded the prize. In 2012, the Nobel records were opened after 50 years and it was revealed that Blixen was among a shortlist of authors considered for the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature, along with John Steinbeck (the eventual winner), Robert Graves, Lawrence Durrell, and Jean Anouilh. Blixen became ineligible after dying in September of that year.

Blixen&#x27;s former secretary and house manager, Clara Svendsen wrote a book, &quot;Notes about Karen Blixen&quot; () in 1974, which told of the transformation of the young woman who moved to Africa into the sophisticated writer. Giving personal anecdotes about Blixen&#x27;s life, Svendsen focused on the private woman behind her public image. Blixen&#x27;s great-nephew, Anders Westenholz, an accomplished writer himself, wrote two books about her and her works: &quot;Kraftens horn: myte og virkelighed i Karen Blixens liv&quot; (1982) (translated into English as &quot;The Power of Aries: myth and reality in Karen Blixen&#x27;s life&quot; and republished in 1987) and &quot;Den glemte abe: mand og kvinde hos Karen Blixen&quot; (1985) (The Forgotten Ape: man and woman in Karen Blixen).

Karen Blixen&#x27;s portrait was featured on the front of the Danish 50-krone banknote, 1997 series, from 7 May 1999 to 25 August 2005. She also featured on Danish postage stamps that were issued in 1980 and 1996. The Asteroid 3318 Blixen was named in her honor on her 100th birthday.

On 17 April 2010, Google celebrated her 125th birthday with a Google Doodle.

The Spanish movie &quot;Karen&quot;, released in 2021, is a minimalist film about her days in Africa. Directed by María Pérez Sanz, Blixen is played by Christina Rosenvinge.

===Rungstedlund Museum===
Blixen lived most of her life at the family estate Rungstedlund, which was acquired by her father in 1879. The property is located in Rungsted, north of Copenhagen, Denmark&#x27;s capital. The oldest parts of the estate date to 1680, and it had been operated as both an inn and a farm. Most of Blixen&#x27;s writing was done in Ewald&#x27;s Room, named after author Johannes Ewald.

In the 1940s, Blixen contemplated selling the estate due to the costs of running it, but the house became a haven for a group of young intellectuals, including Thorkild Bjørnvig, Frank Jæger, Erling Schroeder, among others, who found the house as intriguing as its occupant. They began using the property as a literary salon, which continued to be used by artists until 1991. Bjørnvig, who edited the journal &quot;Heretica&quot; also developed a close friendship with Blixen. The house was repaired and restored between 1958 and 1960 with a portion of the estate set aside as a bird sanctuary. After its restoration, the property was deeded to the Danish Literary Academy and became managed by the Rungstedlund Foundation, founded by Blixen and her siblings. It was opened to the public as a museum in 1991. In 2013 The Karen Blixen Museum joined the Nordic museum portal.

===Karen Blixen Museum, Nairobi===

When Blixen returned to Denmark in 1931, she sold her property to a developer, Remi Martin, who divided the land into parcels. The Nairobi suburb that emerged on the land where Blixen farmed coffee is now named Karen. Blixen herself declared in her later writings that &quot;the residential district of Karen&quot; was &quot;named after me&quot;. The family corporation that owned Blixen&#x27;s farm was incorporated as the &quot;Karen Coffee Company&quot; and the house she lived in was built by the chairman of the board, Aage Westenholz, her uncle. Though Westenholz named the coffee company after his own daughter Karen and not Blixen, the developer of the suburb named the district after its famous author/farmer rather than the name of her company.

Changing hands several times, the original farmhouse occupied by Blixen was purchased by the Danish government and given to the Kenyan government in 1964 as an independence gift. The government established a college of nutrition on the site and then when the film &quot;Out of Africa&quot; was released in 1985, the college was acquired by the National Museums of Kenya. A year later, the Karen Blixen Museum was opened and features many of Blixen&#x27;s furnishings, which were reacquired from Lady McMillan, who had purchased them when Blixen left Africa. The museum house has been judged a significant cultural landmark, not only for its association with Blixen, but as a cultural representative of Kenya&#x27;s European settlement, as well as a significant architectural style—the late 19th-century bungalow.

==Works==
A considerable proportion of the Karen Blixen archive at the Royal Danish Library consists of the unpublished poems, plays and short stories Karen Dinesen wrote before she married and left for Africa. In her teens and early 20s, she probably spent much of her spare time practising the art of writing. It was only when she was 22 that she decided to publish some of her short stories in literary journals, adopting the pen name Osceola.

Some of these works were published posthumously, including tales previously removed from earlier collections and essays she wrote for various occasions.

<text>Johannes Vilhelm Jensen (; 20 January 1873 – 25 November 1950) was a Danish author, known as one of the great Danish writers of the first half of 20th century. He was awarded the 1944 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for the rare strength and fertility of his poetic imagination with which is combined an intellectual curiosity of wide scope and a bold, freshly creative style&quot;. One of his sisters, Thit Jensen, was also a well-known writer and a very vocal, and occasionally controversial, early feminist.

==Early years==
He was born in Farsø, a village in North Jutland, Denmark, as the son of a veterinary surgeon and he grew up in a rural environment. While studying medicine at the University of Copenhagen he worked as a writer to fund his studies. After three years of studying he chose to change careers and devote himself fully to literature.

==Literary works==

The first phase of his work as an author was influenced by &quot;fin-de-siècle&quot; pessimism. His career began with the publication of Himmerland Stories (1898–1910), comprising a series of tales set in the part of Denmark where he was born. During 1900 and 1901 he wrote his first masterpiece, &quot;Kongens Fald&quot; (translated into English as &quot;The Fall of the King&quot; in 1933), a modern historical novel centred on King Christian II. Literary critic Martin Seymour-Smith said it is an &quot;indictment of Danish indecision and lack of vitality, which Jensen saw as a national disease. Apart from this aspect of it, it is a penetrating study of sixteenth-century people.&quot;

In 1906 Jensen created his greatest literary achievement: the collection of verses &quot;Digte 1906&quot; (i.e. &quot;Poems 1906&quot;), which introduced the prose poem to Danish literature. He also wrote poetry, a few plays, and many essays, chiefly on anthropology and the philosophy of evolution. His short story &quot;Ane og Koen&quot; (&quot;Anne and the Cow&quot;) was translated into English by incarcerated author and translator Victor Folke Nelson in 1928.

He developed his theories of evolution in a cycle of six novels, &quot;Den lange rejse&quot; (1908–22), translated into English as &quot;The Long Journey&quot; (1923–24), which was published in a two-volume edition in 1938. This is often considered his main work in prose, a daring and often impressive attempt to create a Darwinian alternative to the Biblical Genesis myth. In this work we see the development of mankind from the Ice Age to the times of Columbus, focusing on pioneering individuals.

Like his compatriot Hans Christian Andersen, he travelled extensively; a trip to the United States inspired a poem of his, &quot;Paa Memphis Station&quot; [At the train station, Memphis, Tennessee], which is well known in Denmark. Walt Whitman was among the writers who influenced Jensen. Jensen later became an atheist.

==Late career==
Jensen&#x27;s most popular literary works were all completed before 1920, a year which also marks his initiation of the &#x27;Museumcentre Aars&#x27; in the town of Aars in Himmerland. After this he mostly concentrated on ambitious biological and zoological studies in an effort to create an ethical system based upon Darwinian ideas. He also hoped to renew classical poetry.

For many years he worked in journalism, writing articles and chronicles for the daily press without ever joining the staff of any newspaper.

==Nobel Prize in Literature==
In 1944 Johannes V. Jensen was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for the rare strength and fertility of his poetic imagination with which is combined an intellectual curiosity of wide scope and a bold, freshly creative style.&quot; At the award ceremony in Stockholm on 10 December 1945 Anders Österling, permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy said: 

Jensen had been nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature on 53 occasions, the first time in 1925. He was nominated every year between 1931 and 1944.

==Legacy==
Jensen was a controversial figure in Danish cultural life. He was a reckless polemicist and his dubious racial theories have damaged his reputation. However, he never showed any obvious fascist leanings.

Today Jensen is still considered the father of Danish modernism, particularly in the area of modern poetry with his introduction of the prose poem and his use of a direct and straightforward language. His direct influence was felt as late as the 1960s. Without being a Danish answer to Kipling, Hamsun or Sandburg, he bears comparison to all three authors. He combines the outlook of the regional writer with the view of the modern academic and scientific observer.

He was famous for experimenting with the form of his writing, amongst other things. In a letter sent to publisher Ernst Bojesen in December 1900, he includes both a happy and sad face. It was in the 1900s that the design evolved from a basic eye and mouth design into a more recognizable design.

In 1999, &quot;The Fall of the King&quot; (1901) was acclaimed as the best Danish novel of the 20th century by the newspapers &quot;Politiken&quot; and &quot;Berlingske Tidende&quot;, independently of each other.

Johannes V. Jensen Land in Northern Greenland was named in his honor.

<text>Lawrence George Durrell (; 27 February 1912 – 7 November 1990) was an expatriate British novelist, poet, dramatist, and travel writer. He was the eldest brother of naturalist and writer Gerald Durrell.

Born in India to British colonial parents, he was sent to England at the age of 11 for his education. He did not like formal education, but started writing poetry at the age of 15. His first book was published in 1935, when he was 23 years old. In March 1935 he and his mother and younger siblings moved to the island of Corfu. Durrell spent many years thereafter living around the world.

His most famous work is &quot;The Alexandria Quartet&quot;, published between 1957 and 1960. The best-known novel in the series is the first, &quot;Justine&quot;. Beginning in 1974, Durrell published &quot;The Avignon Quintet&quot;, using many of the same techniques. The first of these novels, &quot;Monsieur, or the Prince of Darkness&quot;, won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize in 1974. The middle novel, &quot;Constance, or Solitary Practices&quot;, was nominated for the 1982 Booker Prize. In the 20th century, Durrell was a bestselling author and one of the most celebrated writers in England.

Durrell supported his writing by working for many years in the Foreign Service of the British government. His sojourns in various places during and after World War II (such as his time in Alexandria, Egypt) inspired much of his work. He married four times, and had a daughter with each of his first two wives.

==Early years in India and schooling in England==
Durrell was born in Jalandhar, British India, the eldest son of Indian-born British colonials Louisa (who was Anglo-Irish) and Lawrence Samuel Durrell, an engineer of English ancestry. His first school was St. Joseph&#x27;s School, North Point, Darjeeling. He had three younger siblings — two brothers and a sister — naturalist Gerald Durrell, Leslie Durrell and author Margaret Durrell.

Like many other children of the British Raj, at the age of 11, Durrell was sent to England for schooling, where he briefly attended St Olave&#x27;s Grammar School before being sent to St Edmund&#x27;s School Canterbury. His formal education was unsuccessful, and he failed his university entrance examinations. He began to write poetry seriously at the age of 15. His first collection, &quot;Quaint Fragments&quot;, was published in 1931, when he was 19 years old.

Durrell&#x27;s father died of a brain haemorrhage in 1928, at the age of 43. His mother brought the family to England, and in 1932, she, Durrell, and his younger siblings settled in Bournemouth. There, he and his younger brother Gerald became friends with Alan G. Thomas, who had a bookstore and would become an antiquarian. Durrell had a short spell working for an estate agent in Leytonstone (East London).

==Adult life and prose writings==
===First marriage and Durrell&#x27;s move to Corfu===
On 22 January 1935, Durrell married art student Nancy Isobel Myers (1912–1983), with whom he briefly ran a photographic studio in London. It was the first of his four marriages. Durrell was always unhappy in England, and in March of that year he persuaded his new wife, and his mother and younger siblings, to move to the Greek island of Corfu. There they could live more economically and escape both the English weather, and what Durrell considered the stultifying English culture, which he described as &quot;the English death&quot;.

That same year Durrell&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Pied Piper of Lovers&quot;, was published by Cassell. Around this time he chanced upon a copy of Henry Miller&#x27;s 1934 novel &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;. After reading it, he wrote to Miller, expressing intense admiration for his novel. Durrell&#x27;s letter sparked an enduring friendship and mutually critical relationship that spanned 45 years. Durrell&#x27;s next novel, &quot;Panic Spring&quot;, was strongly influenced by Miller&#x27;s work, while his 1938 novel &quot;The Black Book&quot; abounded with &quot;four-letter words... grotesques... [and] its mood equally as apocalyptic&quot; as &quot;Tropic&quot;.

In Corfu, Lawrence and Nancy lived together in bohemian style. For the first few months, the couple lived with the rest of the Durrell family in the Villa Anemoyanni at Kontokali. In early 1936, Durrell and Nancy moved to the White House, a fisherman&#x27;s cottage on the shore of Corfu&#x27;s northeastern coast at Kalami, then a tiny fishing village. The Durrell family&#x27;s friend Theodore Stephanides, a Greek doctor, scientist and poet, was a frequent guest, and Miller stayed at the White House in 1939.

Durrell fictionalised this period of his sojourn on Corfu in the lyrical novel &quot;Prospero&#x27;s Cell&quot;. His younger brother Gerald Durrell, who became a naturalist, published his own version in his memoir &quot;My Family and Other Animals&quot; (1954) and in the following two books of Gerald&#x27;s so-called &quot;Corfu Trilogy&quot;, published in 1969 and 1978. Gerald describes Lawrence as living permanently with his mother and siblings — his wife Nancy is not mentioned at all. Lawrence, in his turn, refers only briefly to his brother Leslie, and he does not mention that his mother and two other siblings were also living on Corfu in those years. The accounts cover a few of the same topics; for example, both Gerald and Lawrence describe the roles played in their lives by the Corfiot taxi driver Spyros Halikiopoulos and Theodore Stephanides. In Corfu, Lawrence became friends with Marie Aspioti, with whom he cooperated in the publication of &quot;Lear&#x27;s Corfu&quot;.

===Pre WW2: In Paris with Miller and Nin===
In August 1937, Lawrence and Nancy travelled to the Villa Seurat in Paris, France, to meet Henry Miller and Anaïs Nin. Together with Alfred Perles, Nin, Miller, and Durrell &quot;began a collaboration aimed at founding their own literary movement. Their projects included &quot;The Shame of the Morning&quot; and the &quot;Booster&quot;, a country club house organ that the Villa Seurat group appropriated &quot;for their own artistic ... ends.&quot; They also started the Villa Seurat Series in order to publish Durrell&#x27;s &quot;Black Book&quot;, Miller&#x27;s &quot;Max and the White Phagocytes&quot;, and Nin&#x27;s &quot;Winter of Artifice&quot;. Jack Kahane of the Obelisk Press served as publisher.

Durrell said that he had three literary uncles: T. S. Eliot, the Greek poet George Seferis, and Miller. He first read Miller after finding a copy of &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; that had been left behind in a public lavatory. He said the book shook him &quot;from stem to stern&quot;.

Durrell&#x27;s first novel of note, &quot;The Black Book: An Agon&quot;, was strongly influenced by Miller; it was published in Paris in 1938. The mildly pornographic work was not published in Great Britain until 1973. In the story, the main character Lawrence Lucifer struggles to escape the spiritual sterility of dying England and finds Greece to be a warm and fertile environment.

===World War Two===
====Breakdown of marriage====
At the outbreak of World War Two in 1939, Durrell&#x27;s mother and siblings returned to England, while Nancy and he remained on Corfu. In 1940, they had a daughter, Penelope Berengaria. After the fall of Greece, Lawrence and Nancy escaped from Kalamata, where they had been teaching, via Crete to Alexandria, Egypt. The marriage was already under strain and they separated in 1942. Nancy took the baby Penelope with her to Jerusalem.

During his years on Corfu, Durrell had made notes for a book about the island. He did not write it fully until he was in Egypt towards the end of the war. In the book &quot;Prospero&#x27;s Cell&quot;, Durrell described Corfu as &quot;this brilliant little speck of an island in the Ionian&quot;. with waters &quot;like the heartbeat of the world itself&quot;.

====Press attaché in Egypt and Rhodes; second marriage====
During World War Two, Durrell served as a press attaché to the British embassies, first in Cairo and then Alexandria. While in Alexandria he met Eve (Yvette) Cohen (1918–2004), a Jewish Alexandrian. She inspired his character Justine in &quot;The Alexandria Quartet&quot;. In 1947, after his divorce from Nancy was completed, Durrell married Eve Cohen, with whom he had been living since 1942. The couple&#x27;s daughter, Sappho Jane, was born in Oxfordshire in 1951, and named after the ancient Greek poet Sappho.

In May 1945, Durrell obtained a posting to Rhodes, the largest of the Dodecanese islands that Italy had taken over from the disintegrating Ottoman Empire in 1912 during the Balkan Wars. With the Italian surrender to the Allies in 1943, German forces took over most of the islands and held onto them as besieged fortresses until the war&#x27;s end. Mainland Greece was at that time locked in civil war. A temporary British military government was established in the Dodecanese at war&#x27;s end, pending sovereignty being transferred to Greece in 1947, as part of war reparations from Italy. Durrell set up house with Eve in the little gatekeeper&#x27;s lodge of an old Turkish cemetery, just across the road from the building used by the British Administration. (Today this is the Casino in Rhodes&#x27; new town.) His co-habitation with Eve Cohen could be discreetly ignored by his employer, while the couple gained from staying within the perimeter security zone of the main building. His book &quot;Reflections on a Marine Venus&quot; was inspired by this period and was a lyrical celebration of the island. It avoids more than a passing mention of the troubled war times.

===British Council work in Córdoba and Belgrade; teaching in Cyprus===
In 1947, Durrell was appointed director of the British Council Institute in Córdoba, Argentina. He served there for eighteen months, giving lectures on cultural topics. He returned to London with Eve in the summer of 1948, around the time that Marshal Tito of Yugoslavia broke ties with Stalin&#x27;s Cominform. Durrell was posted by the British Council to Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and served there until 1952. This sojourn gave him material for his novel &quot;White Eagles over Serbia&quot; (1957).

In 1952, Eve had a nervous breakdown and was hospitalised in England. Durrell moved to Cyprus with their daughter Sappho Jane, buying a house and taking a position teaching English literature at the Pancyprian Gymnasium to support his writing. He next worked in public relations for the British government during the local agitation for union with Greece. He wrote about his time in Cyprus in &quot;Bitter Lemons&quot;, which won the Duff Cooper Prize in 1957. In 1954, he was selected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. Durrell left Cyprus in August 1956. Political agitation on the island and his British government position resulted in his becoming a target for assassination attempts.

===&quot;Justine&quot; and &quot;The Alexandria Quartet&quot;===
In 1957, Durrell published &quot;Justine&quot;, the first novel of what was to become his most famous work, &quot;The Alexandria Quartet&quot;. &quot;Justine&quot;, &quot;Balthazar&quot; (1958), &quot;Mountolive&quot; (1958), and &quot;Clea&quot; (1960), deal with events before and during the Second World War in the Egyptian city of Alexandria. The first three books tell essentially the same story and series of events, but from the varying perspectives of different characters. Durrell described this technique in his introductory note in &quot;Balthazar&quot; as &quot;relativistic&quot;. Only in the final novel, &quot;Clea&quot;, does the story advance in time and reach a conclusion. Critics praised the &quot;Quartet&quot; for its richness of style, the variety and vividness of its characters, its movement between the personal and the political, and its locations in and around the ancient Egyptian city which Durrell portrays as the chief protagonist: &quot;The city which used us as its flora—precipitated in us conflicts which were hers and which we mistook for our own: beloved Alexandria!&quot; &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; review of the &quot;Quartet&quot; stated: &quot;If ever a work bore an instantly recognizable signature on every sentence, this is it.&quot;

In 2012, when the Nobel Records were opened after 50 years, it was revealed that Durrell had been nominated for the 1961 Nobel Prize in Literature, but did not make the final list. In 1962, however, he did receive serious consideration, along with Robert Graves, Jean Anouilh, and Karen Blixen, but ultimately lost to John Steinbeck. The Academy decided that &quot;Durrell was not to be given preference this year&quot;—probably because &quot;they did not think that &quot;The Alexandria Quartet&quot; was enough, so they decided to keep him under observation for the future.&quot; However, he was never nominated again. They also noted that he &quot;gives a dubious aftertaste … because of [his] monomaniacal preoccupation with erotic complications.&quot;

===Two further marriages and settling in Languedoc===
In 1955 Durrell separated from Eve Cohen. He married again in 1961, to Claude-Marie Vincendon, whom he met on Cyprus. She was a Jewish woman born in Alexandria. Durrell was devastated when Claude-Marie died of cancer in 1967. He married for the fourth and last time in 1973, to Ghislaine de Boysson, a French woman. They divorced in 1979.

In the spring of 1960, Durrell was hired to rewrite the script for the 1963 film &quot;Cleopatra&quot;. The production company had also proposed a film of &quot;Justine&quot; which would eventually appear in 1969.

Durrell settled in Sommières, a small village in Languedoc, France, where he purchased a large house on the edge of the village. The house was situated in extensive grounds surrounded by a wall. Here he wrote &quot;The Revolt of Aphrodite&quot;, comprising &quot;Tunc&quot; (1968) and &quot;Nunquam&quot; (1970). He also completed &quot;The Avignon Quintet&quot;, published from 1974 to 1985, which used many of the same motifs and styles found in his metafictional &quot;Alexandria Quartet&quot;. Although the related works are frequently described as a quintet, Durrell referred to it as a &quot;quincunx&quot;.

The opening novel, &quot;Monsieur, or the Prince of Darkness&quot;, received the 1974 James Tait Black Memorial Prize. That year, Durrell was living in the United States and serving as the Andrew Mellon Visiting Professor of Humanities at the California Institute of Technology.
The middle novel of the quincunx, &quot;Constance, or Solitary Practices&quot; (1981), which portrays France in the 1940s under the German occupation, was nominated for the Booker Prize in 1982. 
Other works from this period are &quot;Sicilian Carousel&quot;, a non-fiction celebration of that island, &quot;The Greek Islands&quot;, and &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Vast Ghost&quot;, which is set in and chiefly about the region of Provence, France.

==Later years, literary influences, attitudes and reputation==
A longtime smoker, Durrell suffered from emphysema for many years. He died of a stroke at his house in Sommières in November 1990, and was buried in the churchyard of the Chapelle St-Julien de Montredon in Sommières.

He was predeceased by his younger daughter, Sappho Jane, who took her own life in 1985 at the age of 33. After Durrell&#x27;s death, it emerged that Sappho&#x27;s diaries included allusions to an alleged incestuous relationship with her father.

===Durrell&#x27;s government service and his attitudes===
Durrell worked for several years in the service of the Foreign Office. He was senior press officer to the British embassies in Athens and Cairo, press attaché in Alexandria and Belgrade, and director of the British Institutes in Kalamata, Greece, and Córdoba, Argentina. He was also director of Public Relations in the Dodecanese Islands and on Cyprus. He later refused an honour as a Knight Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George, because he felt his &quot;conservative, reactionary and right-wing&quot; political views might be a cause for embarrassment. Durrell&#x27;s works of humour, &quot;Esprit de Corps&quot; and &quot;Stiff Upper Lip&quot;, are about life in the diplomatic corps, particularly in Serbia. He claimed to have disliked both Egypt and Argentina, although not nearly so much as he disliked Yugoslavia.

===Durrell&#x27;s poetry===
Durrell&#x27;s poetry has been overshadowed by his novels, but Peter Porter, in his introduction to a &quot;Selected Poems&quot;, calls Durrell &quot;One of the best [poets] of the past hundred years. And one of the most enjoyable.&quot; Porter describes Durrell&#x27;s poetry: &quot;Always beautiful as sound and syntax. Its innovation lies in its refusal to be more high-minded than the things it records, together with its handling of the whole lexicon of language.&quot;

==British citizenship==
For much of his life, Durrell resisted being identified solely as British, or as only affiliated with Britain. He preferred to be considered cosmopolitan. Since his death, there have been claims that Durrell never had British citizenship, but he was originally classified as a British citizen as he was born to British colonial parents living in India under the British Raj.

In 1966 Durrell and many other former and present British residents became classified as non-patrial, as a result of an amendment to the Commonwealth Immigrants Act. The law was covertly intended to reduce migration from India, Pakistan, and the West Indies, but Durrell was also penalized by it and refused citizenship. He had not been told that he needed to &quot;register as a British citizen in 1962 under the Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962&quot;.

As &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported in 2002, Durrell in 1966 was &quot;one of the best selling, most celebrated English novelists of the late 20th century&quot; and &quot;at the height of his fame&quot;. Denied the normal citizenship right to enter or settle in Britain, Durrell had to apply for a visa for each entry. Diplomats were outraged and embarrassed at these events. &quot;Sir Patrick Reilly, the ambassador in Paris, was so incensed that he wrote to his Foreign Office superiors: &#x27;I venture to suggest it might be wise to ensure that ministers, both in the Foreign Office and the Home Office, are aware that one of our greatest living writers in the English language is being debarred from the citizenship of the United Kingdom to which he is entitled.&#x27;&quot;

==Legacy==
After Durrell&#x27;s death, his lifelong friend Alan G. Thomas donated a collection of books and periodicals associated with Durrell to the British Library. This is maintained as the distinct Lawrence Durrell Collection. Thomas had earlier edited an anthology of writings, letters and poetry by Durrell, published as &quot;Spirit of Place&quot; (1969). It contained material related to Durrell&#x27;s own published works. An important documentary resource is kept by the Bibliothèque Lawrence Durrell at Paris Nanterre University.

<text>Sir Henry Rider Haggard (; 22 June 1856 – 14 May 1925) was an English writer of adventure fiction romances set in exotic locations, predominantly Africa, and a pioneer of the lost world literary genre. He was also involved in land reform throughout the British Empire. His stories, situated at the lighter end of Victorian literature and including the eighteen Allan Quatermain stories beginning with &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;, continue to be popular and influential.

==Life and career==

===Family===
Henry Rider Haggard, generally known as H. Rider Haggard or Rider Haggard, was born at Bradenham, Norfolk, the eighth of ten children, to William Meybohm Rider Haggard, a barrister, and Ella Doveton, an author and poet. His father was born in Saint Petersburg, Russia, in 1817 to British parents.

A member of the Haggard family, he was the great-nephew of the ecclesiastical lawyer John Haggard and an uncle of the naval officer Admiral Sir Vernon Haggard and the diplomat Sir Godfrey Haggard.

===Education===
Haggard was initially sent to Garsington Rectory in Oxfordshire to study under Reverend H. J. Graham, but, unlike his elder brothers, who graduated from various private schools, he attended Ipswich Grammar School. This was because his father, who perhaps regarded him as somebody who was not going to amount to much, could no longer afford to maintain his expensive private education. After failing his army entrance exam, he was sent to a private crammer in London to prepare for the entrance exam for the British Foreign Office, which he never sat. During his two years in London he came into contact with people interested in the study of psychic phenomena.

===South Africa, 1875–1882===
In 1875, Haggard&#x27;s father sent him to what is now South Africa to take up an unpaid position as assistant to the secretary to Sir Henry Bulwer, Lieutenant-Governor of the Colony of Natal. In 1876, he was transferred to the staff of Sir Theophilus Shepstone, Special Commissioner for the Transvaal. It was in this role that Haggard was present in Pretoria in April 1877 for the official announcement of the British annexation of the Boer Republic of the Transvaal. Indeed, Haggard raised the Union flag and read out much of the proclamation following the loss of voice of the official originally entrusted with the duty.

At about that time, Haggard fell in love with Mary Elizabeth &quot;Lilly&quot; Jackson, whom he intended to marry once he obtained paid employment in Africa. In 1878, he became Registrar of the High Court in the Transvaal, and wrote to his father informing him that he intended to return to England and marry her. His father forbade it until Haggard had made a career for himself, and by 1879 Jackson had married Frank Archer, a well-to-do banker. When Haggard eventually returned to England, he married a friend of his sister, Marianna Louisa Margitson (1859–1943) in 1880, and the couple travelled to Africa together. They had a son named Jack (born 1881, died of measles at age 10) and three daughters, Angela (b.1883), Dorothy (b.1884) and Lilias (b.1892). Lilias Rider Haggard became an author, edited &quot;The Rabbit Skin Cap&quot; and &quot;I Walked By Night&quot;, and wrote a biography of her father entitled &quot;The Cloak That I Left&quot; (published in 1951).

===In England, 1882–1925===
Moving back to England in 1882, the couple settled in Ditchingham, Norfolk, Louisa Margitson&#x27;s ancestral home. Later they lived in Kessingland and had connections with the church in Bungay, Suffolk. Haggard turned to the study of law and was called to the bar in 1884. His practice of law was desultory and much of his time was taken up by the writing of novels, which he saw as being more profitable. Haggard lived at 69 Gunterstone Road in Hammersmith, London, from mid-1885 to circa April 1888. It was at this Hammersmith address that he completed &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; (published September 1885).

Haggard was heavily influenced by the larger-than-life adventurers whom he met in colonial Africa, most notably Frederick Selous and Frederick Russell Burnham. He created his Allan Quatermain adventures under their influence, during a time when great mineral wealth was being discovered in Africa, as well as the ruins of ancient lost civilisations of the continent such as Great Zimbabwe.

Three of his books, &quot;The Wizard&quot; (1896), &quot;Black Heart and White Heart; a Zulu Idyll&quot; (1896), and &quot;Elissa; the Doom of Zimbabwe&quot; (1898), are dedicated to Burnham&#x27;s daughter Nada, the first white child born in Bulawayo; she had been named after Haggard&#x27;s 1892 book &quot;Nada the Lily&quot;. Haggard belonged to the Athenaeum, Savile, and Authors&#x27; clubs.

===Aid for Lilly Archer===

Years later, when Haggard was a successful novelist, he was contacted by his former love, Lilly Archer, née Jackson. She had been deserted by her husband, who had embezzled funds entrusted to him and had fled bankrupt to Africa. Haggard installed her and her sons in a house and saw to the children&#x27;s education. Lilly eventually followed her husband to Africa, where he infected her with syphilis before dying of it himself. Lilly returned to England in late 1907, where Haggard again supported her until her death on 22 April 1909. These details were not generally known until the publication of Haggard&#x27;s 1981 biography by Sydney Higgins.

===Writing career===
After returning to England in 1882, Haggard published a book on the political situation in South Africa, as well as a handful of unsuccessful novels, before writing &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;. He accepted a 10 percent royalty rather than £100 for the copyright.

A sequel soon followed entitled &quot;Allan Quatermain&quot;, followed by &quot;She&quot; and its sequel &quot;Ayesha&quot;, swashbuckling adventure novels set in the context of the Scramble for Africa (although the action of &quot;Ayesha&quot; happens in Tibet). The hugely popular &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; is sometimes considered the first of the Lost World genre. &quot;She&quot; is generally considered to be one of the classics of imaginative literature, and with 83 million copies sold by 1965, it is one of the best-selling books in history. He also wrote &quot;Nada the Lily&quot; (a tale of adventure among the Zulus) and the epic Viking romance &quot;Eric Brighteyes&quot;.

His novels portray many of the stereotypes associated with colonialism, yet they are unusual for the degree of sympathy with which the native populations are portrayed. Africans often play heroic roles in the novels, although the protagonists are typically European. Notable examples are the heroic Zulu warrior Umslopogaas, and Ignosi, the rightful king of Kukuanaland, in &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;. Having developed an intense mutual friendship with the three Englishmen who help him regain his throne, he accepts their advice and abolishes witch-hunts and arbitrary capital punishment.

Three of Haggard&#x27;s novels were written in collaboration with his friend Andrew Lang, who shared his interest in the spiritual realm and paranormal phenomena.

Haggard also wrote about agricultural and social reform, in part inspired by his experiences in Africa, but also based on what he saw in Europe. At the end of his life, he was a staunch opponent of Bolshevism, a position that he shared with his friend Rudyard Kipling. The two had bonded upon Kipling&#x27;s arrival at London in 1889, largely on the strength of their shared opinions, and remained lifelong friends.

===Public affairs===
Haggard was involved in reforming agriculture and was a member of many commissions on land use and related affairs, work that involved several trips to the Colonies and Dominions. It eventually led to the passage of the Development and Road Improvement Funds Act 1909.

He stood unsuccessfully for Parliament as a Conservative candidate for the Eastern division of Norfolk in the 1895 summer election, losing by 197 votes.
He was appointed a Knight Bachelor in 1912 and a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1919 New Year Honours.

===Death===
Haggard died on 14 May 1925 in Marylebone, London, aged 68. His ashes were buried at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Ditchingham. His papers are held at the Norfolk Record Office. His relatives include the writer Stephen Haggard (great-nephew), the director Piers Haggard (great-great-nephew), and the actress Daisy Haggard (great-great-great-niece).

==Legacy==
=== Influence===
Psychoanalyst Carl Jung considered Ayesha, the female protagonist of &quot;She&quot;, to be a manifestation of the anima. Her epithet &quot;She Who Must Be Obeyed&quot; is used by British author John Mortimer in his &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot; series as the lead character&#x27;s private name for his wife, Hilda, before whom he trembles at home (despite the fact that he is a barrister with some skill in court). Haggard&#x27;s Lost World genre influenced popular American pulp writers such as Edgar Rice Burroughs, Robert E. Howard, Talbot Mundy, Philip José Farmer, and Abraham Merritt. Allan Quatermain, the adventure hero of eighteen novels and short stories beginning with &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; (1885), was a template for the American character Indiana Jones. Quatermain has gained recent popularity thanks to being a main character in the &quot;League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot;.

Graham Greene, in an essay about Haggard, stated, &quot;Enchantment is just what this writer exercised; he fixed pictures in our minds that thirty years have been unable to wear away.&quot; Haggard was praised in 1965 by Roger Lancelyn Green, one of the Oxford Inklings, as a writer of a consistently high level of &quot;literary skill and sheer imaginative power&quot; and a co-originator with Robert Louis Stevenson of the &quot;Age of the Story Tellers&quot;.

=== On race===
Rider Haggard&#x27;s works have been criticised for their depictions of non-Europeans. In his non-fiction book &quot;Decolonising the Mind&quot;, Kenyan author Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o refers to Haggard, who he says was one of the canonical authors in primary and secondary school, as one of the &quot;geniuses of racism.&quot; Author and academic Micere Mugo wrote in 1973 that reading the description of &quot;an old African woman in Rider Haggard&#x27;s &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; had for a long time made her feel mortal terror whenever she encountered old African women.&quot; 

Haggard&#x27;s works include many positive views of Africans. He includes them as heroes in some of his stories. For instance, all the main characters in &quot;Nada the Lily&quot; are black, and the book is narrated by an African character, while in &quot;Black Heart and White Heart: A Zulu Idyll&quot; the &quot;black-hearted&quot; character is a white man, while the &quot;white-hearted&quot; (i.e. virtuous) character is black. 

Haggard criticises the use of the word &quot;nigger,&quot; and in non-fiction works like &quot;Cetywayo and His White Neighbours&quot;, he argues that natives should be allowed to retain their practices, including polygamy.

===Influence on children&#x27;s literature in the 19th century===
During the 19th century, Haggard was one of many individuals who contributed to children&#x27;s literature. Morton N. Cohen described &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; as a story that has &quot;universal interest, for grown-ups as well as youngsters&quot;. Haggard himself wanted to write the book for boys, but it ultimately had an influence on children and adults around the world. Cohen explained, &quot;&quot;King Solomon’s Mines&quot; was being read in the public schools [and] aloud in class-rooms&quot;.

=== General influence and legacy ===
The first chapter of Haggard&#x27;s book &quot;People of the Mist&quot; is credited with inspiring the motto of the Royal Air Force (formerly the Royal Flying Corps), &quot;Per ardua ad astra&quot;.

In 1925, his daughter Lilias commissioned a memorial window for Ditchingham Church, in his honour, from James Powell and Sons. The design features the Pyramids, his farm in Africa, and Bungay as seen from the Vineyard Hills near his home.

The Rider Haggard Society was founded in 1985. It publishes the &quot;Haggard Journal&quot; three times a year.

==Works==
== Films based on Haggard&#x27;s works ==
Haggard&#x27;s writings have been turned into films many times including:
* &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; has been adapted for film at least seven times.
** The first version, &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;, directed by Robert Stevenson, premiered in 1937.
** The best known version premiered in 1950: &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;, directed by Compton Bennett and Andrew Marton, was followed in 1959 by a sequel, &quot;Watusi&quot;.
** In 1979 a low-budget version directed by Alvin Rakoff, &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Treasure&quot;, combined both &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; and &quot;Allan Quatermain&quot; in one story.
** The 1985 film &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; was a tongue-in-cheek comedy, with a 1987 sequel in the same vein, &quot;Allan Quatermain and the Lost City of Gold&quot;.
** Around the same time an Australian animated TV film came out as &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;.
** In 2004 an American TV mini-series, &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; starred Patrick Swayze.
** In 2008 a direct-to-video adaptation, &quot;Allan Quatermain and the Temple of Skulls&quot;, was released by Mark Atkins; it bore more resemblance to Indiana Jones than the novel.
* &quot;&quot; has been adapted for film at least ten times, and was one of the earliest movies to be made:
** In 1899, as &quot;La Colonne de feu&quot; (&quot;The Pillar of Fire&quot;), by Georges Méliès.
** An American 1911 version starred Marguerite Snow.
** A British-produced version appeared in 1916, and in 1917 Valeska Suratt appeared in a production for Fox which is lost.
** In 1925 a silent film of &quot;She&quot;, starring Betty Blythe, was produced with the active participation of Rider Haggard, who wrote the intertitles. This film combines elements from all the books in the series.
** The 1935 version, filmed a decade later, featured Helen Gahagan, Randolph Scott, Helen Mack, and Nigel Bruce. The lost city of Kôr is set in the Arctic, rather than Africa, and depicts the ancient civilisation in an Art Deco style. The music is by Max Steiner. The screenplay combines elements from all the books in the series, including &quot;Wisdom&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. In 2006, Legend Films and Ray Harryhausen restored and colorized the film for DVD release, as it was originally intended.
** The 1965 film &quot;She&quot; was produced by Hammer Film Productions; it starred Ursula Andress as Ayesha and John Richardson as her reincarnated love, with Peter Cushing and Bernard Cribbins as other members of the expedition.
** The 1984 adaptation of &quot;She&quot; took place in a post-apocalyptic setting, attempting to capitalize on the fame of &quot;Mad Max&quot;.
** In 2001, another adaptation was released direct-to-video with Ian Duncan as Leo Vincey, Ophélie Winter as Ayesha and Marie Bäumer as Roxane.
* &quot;Dawn&quot; The film &quot;Dawn&quot; was released in 1917, starring Hubert Carter and Annie Esmond.
* &quot;Jess&quot;
** In 1912 featuring Marguerite Snow, Florence La Badie and James Cruze.
** In 1914 with Constance Crawley and Arthur Maude.
** In 1917 as &quot;Heart and Soul&quot;, starring Theda Bara in the title role.
* &quot;Cleopatra&quot;The 1917 American film &quot;Cleopatra&quot; was based on Haggard&#x27;s novel and other sources.
* &quot;Beatrice&quot;The book was adapted into a 1921 Italian silent drama film called &quot;The Stronger Passion&quot;, directed by Herbert Brenon and starring Marie Doro and Sandro Salvini.
* &quot;Swallow&quot;The novel was adapted into a 1922 South African film.
* &quot;Stella Fregelius&quot;The book was adapted into a 1921 British film, &quot;Stella&quot;.
* &quot;Moon of Israel&quot;This novel was the basis of a script by Ladislaus Vajda, for film-director Michael Curtiz in his 1924 Austrian epic known as &quot;Die Sklavenkönigin&quot; (&quot;Queen of the Slaves&quot;).
* Allen Quatermain is the lead character in the film League of Extraordianry Gentlemen (2003). Although the plot of this film is not found in any form in any of Haggard&#x27;s work, the Quatermain in this film is explicitly meant to be Haggard&#x27;s Quatermain.

<text>Samuel Richardson (baptised 19 August 1689 – 4 July 1761) was an English writer and printer known for three epistolary novels: &quot;Pamela; or, Virtue Rewarded&quot; (1740), &quot;&quot; (1748) and &quot;The History of Sir Charles Grandison&quot; (1753). He printed almost 500 works, including journals and magazines, working periodically with the London bookseller Andrew Millar. Richardson had been apprenticed to a printer, whose daughter he eventually married. He lost her along with their six children, but remarried and had six more children, of whom four daughters reached adulthood, leaving no male heirs to continue the print shop. As it ran down, he wrote his first novel at the age of 51 and joined the admired writers of his day. Leading acquaintances included Samuel Johnson and Sarah Fielding, the physician and Behmenist George Cheyne, and the theologian and writer William Law, whose books he printed. At Law&#x27;s request, Richardson printed some poems by John Byrom. In literature, he rivalled Henry Fielding; the two responded to each other&#x27;s literary styles.

==Biography==
Richardson, one of nine children, was probably born in 1689 in Mackworth, Derbyshire, to Samuel and Elizabeth Richardson. It is unsure where in Derbyshire he was born because Richardson always concealed the location, but it has recently been discovered that Richardson probably lived in poverty as a child. The older Richardson was, according to the younger:

His mother, according to Richardson, &quot;was also a good woman, of a family not ungenteel; but whose father and mother died in her infancy, within half-an-hour of each other, in the London pestilence of 1665&quot;.

The trade his father pursued was that of a joiner (a type of carpenter, but Richardson explains that it was &quot;then more distinct from that of a carpenter than now it is with us&quot;). In describing his father&#x27;s occupation, Richardson stated that &quot;he was a good draughtsman and understood architecture&quot;, and it was suggested by Samuel Richardson&#x27;s son-in-law that the senior Richardson was a cabinetmaker and an exporter of mahogany while working at Aldersgate-street. The abilities and position of his father brought him to the attention of James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth. However, as Richardson claims, this was to Richardson senior&#x27;s &quot;great detriment&quot; because of the failure of the Monmouth Rebellion, which ended in the death of Scott in 1685. After Scott&#x27;s death, the elder Richardson was forced to abandon his business in London and live a modest life in Derbyshire.

===Early life===
The Richardsons were not exiled forever from London; they eventually returned, and the young Richardson was educated at Christ&#x27;s Hospital grammar school. The extent that he was educated at the school is uncertain, and Leigh Hunt wrote years later:

However, this conflicts with Richardson&#x27;s nephew&#x27;s account that &quot;&#x27;it is certain that [Richardson] was never sent to a more respectable seminary&#x27; than &#x27;a private grammar school&#x27; located in Derbyshire&quot;.
Little is known of Richardson&#x27;s early years beyond the few things that Richardson was willing to share. Although he was not forthcoming with specific events and incidents, he did talk about the origins of his writing ability; Richardson would tell stories to his friends and spent his youth constantly writing letters. One such letter, written when Richardson was almost 11, was directed to a woman in her 50s who was in the habit of constantly criticizing others. &quot;Assuming the style and address of a person in years&quot;, Richardson cautioned her about her actions. However, his handwriting was used to determine that it was his work, and the woman complained to his mother. The result was, as he explains, that &quot;my mother chid me for the freedom taken by such a boy with a woman of her years&quot; but also &quot;commended my principles, though she censured the liberty taken&quot;.

After his writing ability was known, he began to help others in the community write letters. In particular, Richardson, at the age of 13, helped many of the girls that he associated with to write responses to various love letters they received. As Richardson claims, &quot;I have been directed to chide, and even repulse, when an offence was either taken or given, at the very time that the heart of the chider or repulser was open before me, overflowing with esteem and affect&quot;. Although this helped his writing ability, he in 1753 advised the Dutch minister Stinstra not to draw large conclusions from these early actions:

He continued to explain that he did not fully understand females until writing &quot;Clarissa&quot;, and these letters were only a beginning.

===Early career===
The elder Richardson originally wanted his son to become a clergyman, but he was not able to afford the education that the younger Richardson would require, so he let his son pick his own profession. He selected the profession of printing because he hoped to &quot;gratify a thirst for reading, which, in after years, he disclaimed&quot;. At the age of 17, in 1706, Richardson was bound in seven-year apprenticeship under John Wilde as a printer. Wilde&#x27;s printing shop was in Golden Lion Court on Aldersgate Street, and Wilde had a reputation as &quot;a master who grudged every hour... that tended not to his profit&quot;.

While working for Wilde, he met a rich gentleman who took an interest in Richardson&#x27;s writing abilities and the two began to correspond with each other. When the gentleman died a few years later, Richardson lost a potential patron, which delayed his ability to pursue his own writing career. He decided to devote himself completely to his apprenticeship, and he worked his way up to a position as a compositor and a corrector of the shop&#x27;s printing press. In 1713, Richardson left Wilde to become &quot;Overseer and Corrector of a Printing-Office&quot;. This meant that Richardson ran his own shop, but the location of that shop is unknown. It is possible that the shop was located in Staining Lane or may have been jointly run with John Leake in Jewin Street.

In 1719, Richardson was able to take his freedom from being an apprentice and was soon able to afford to set up his own printing shop, which he did after he moved near the Salisbury Court district close to Fleet Street. Although he claimed to business associates that he was working out of the well-known Salisbury Court, his printing shop was more accurately located on the corner of Blue Ball Court and Dorset Street in a house that later became Bell&#x27;s Building. On 23 November 1721, Richardson married Martha Wilde, the daughter of his former employer. The match was &quot;prompted mainly by prudential considerations&quot;, although Richardson would claim later that there was a strong love-affair between Martha and him. He soon brought her to live with him in the printing shop that served also as his home.

A key moment in Richardson&#x27;s career came on 6 August 1722 when he took on his first apprentices: Thomas Gover, George Mitchell, and Joseph Chrichley. He would later take on William Price (2 May 1727), Samuel Jolley (5 September 1727), Bethell Wellington (2 September 1729), and Halhed Garland (5 May 1730).

One of Richardson&#x27;s first major printing contracts came in June 1723 when he began to print the bi-weekly &quot;The True Briton&quot; for Philip Wharton, 1st Duke of Wharton. This was a Jacobite political paper which attacked the government and was soon censored for printing &quot;common libels&quot;. However, Richardson&#x27;s name was not on the publication, and he was able to escape any of the negative fallout, although it is possible that Richardson participated in the papers as far as actually writing one himself. The only lasting effect from the paper would be the incorporation of Wharton&#x27;s libertine characteristics in the character of Lovelace in Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Clarissa&quot;, although Wharton would be only one of many models of libertine behaviour that Richardson would find in his life. In 1724, Richardson befriended Thomas Gent, Henry Woodfall, and Arthur Onslow, the latter of those would become the Speaker of the House of Commons.

Over their ten years of marriage, the Richardsons had five sons and one daughter – three of the boys were successively named Samuel after their father, but all three died young. Soon after the death of William, their fourth child, Martha died on 25 January 1731. Their youngest son, Samuel, was to live past his mother for a year longer, but succumbed to illness in 1732. After his final son died, Richardson attempted to move on with his life. He married Elizabeth Leake, whose father was a printer, and the two moved into another house on Blue Ball Court. However, Elizabeth and his daughter were not the only ones living with him because Richardson allowed five of his apprentices to lodge in his home. Elizabeth had six children (five daughters and one son) with Richardson; four of their daughters, Mary, Martha, Anne, and Sarah, reached adulthood and survived their father. Their son, another Samuel, was born in 1739 and died in 1740.

In 1733, Richardson was granted a contract with the House of Commons, with help from Onslow, to print the &quot;Journals of the House&quot;. The 26 volumes of the work soon improved his business. Later in 1733, he wrote &quot;The Apprentice&#x27;s Vade Mecum&quot;, urging young men like himself to be diligent and self-denying. The work was intended to &quot;create the perfect apprentice&quot;. Written in response to the &quot;epidemick Evils of the present Age&quot;, the text is best known for its condemnation of popular forms of entertainment including theatres, taverns and gambling. The manual targets the apprentice as the focal point for the moral improvement of society, not because he is most susceptible to vice, but because, Richardson suggests, he is more responsive to moral improvement than his social betters. During this time, Richardson took on five more apprentices: Thomas Verren (1 August 1732), Richard Smith (6 February 1733), Matthew Stimson (7 August 1733), Bethell Wellington (7 May 1734), and Daniel Green (1 October 1734). His total staff during the 1730s numbered seven, as his first three apprentices were free by 1728, and two of his apprentices, Verren and Smith, died soon into their apprenticeship. The loss of Verren was particularly devastating to Richardson because Verren was his nephew and his hope for a male heir that would take over the press.

===First novel===

Work continued to improve, and Richardson printed the &quot;Daily Journal&quot; between 1736 and 1737, and the &quot;Daily Gazetteer&quot; in 1738. During his time printing the &quot;Daily Journal&quot;, he was also printer to the &quot;Society for the Encouragement of Learning&quot;, a group that tried to help authors become independent from publishers, but collapsed soon after. In December 1738, Richardson&#x27;s printing business was successful enough to allow him to lease a house in Fulham in London. This house, which would be Richardson&#x27;s residence from 1739 to 1754, was later named &quot;The Grange&quot; in 1836. In 1739, Richardson was asked by his friends Charles Rivington and John Osborn to write &quot;a little volume of Letters, in a common style, on such subjects as might be of use to those country readers, who were unable to indite for themselves&quot;. While writing this volume, Richardson was inspired to write his first novel.

Richardson made the transition from master printer to novelist on 6 November 1740 with the publication of &quot;&quot;. &quot;Pamela&quot; was sometimes regarded as &quot;the first novel in English&quot; or the first modern novel. Richardson explained the origins of the work:


After Richardson started the work on 10 November 1739, his wife and her friends became so interested in the story that he finished it on 10 January 1740. Pamela Andrews, the heroine of &quot;Pamela&quot;, represented &quot;Richardson&#x27;s insistence upon well-defined feminine roles&quot; and was part of a common fear held during the 18th century that women were &quot;too bold&quot;. In particular, her &quot;zeal for housewifery&quot; was included as a proper role of women in society. Although &quot;Pamela&quot; and the title heroine were popular and gave a proper model for how women should act, they inspired &quot;a storm of anti-Pamelas&quot; (like Henry Fielding&#x27;s &quot;Shamela&quot; and &quot;Joseph Andrews&quot; and Eliza Haywood&#x27;s &quot;The Anti-Pamela&quot;) because the character &quot;perfectly played her part&quot;.

Later that year, Richardson printed Rivington and Osborn&#x27;s book which inspired &quot;Pamela&quot; under the title of &quot;Letters written to and for particular Friends, on the most important Occasions. Directing not only the requisite Style and Forms to be observed in writing&quot; Familiar Letters; &quot;but how to think and act justly and prudently, in the common Concerns of Human Life&quot;. The book contained many anecdotes and lessons on how to live, but Richardson did not care for the work and it was never expanded even though it went into six editions during his life. He went so far as to tell a friend, &quot;This volume of letters is not worthy of your perusal&quot; because they were &quot;intended for the lower classes of people&quot;.

Multiple sequels to Pamela were written by other writers, such as &quot;Pamela&#x27;s Conduct in High Life&quot;, which was written by John Kelly and published by Ward and Chandler in September 1741. Published that same year were two anonymous sequels: &quot;Pamela in High Life&quot; and &quot;The Life of Pamela&quot;, the latter being a third-person retelling of both Richardson&#x27;s original novel and Kelly&#x27;s continuation. These unofficial sequels capitalized off the character&#x27;s popularity and readers desire to learn what happened to Pamela and Mr. B after the conclusion of Richardson&#x27;s novel. This compelled Richardson to write a sequel to the novel, &quot;Pamela in her Exalted Condition&quot;, in December 1741. The novel had a poorer reception than the first, as Peter Sabor writes, &quot;the continuation is a far blander affair than the original work,&quot; focusing on Pamela&#x27;s gentility and married life. The public&#x27;s interest in the characters was waning, and this was only furthered by Richardson&#x27;s focusing on Pamela discussing morality, literature, and philosophy.

===Later career===
After the failures of the &quot;Pamela&quot; sequels, Richardson began to compose a new novel. It was not until early 1744 that the content of the plot was known, and this happened when he sent Aaron Hill two chapters to read. In particular, Richardson asked Hill if he could help shorten the chapters because Richardson was worried about the length of the novel. Hill refused, saying,


In July, Richardson sent Hill a complete &quot;design&quot; of the story, and asked Hill to try again, but Hill responded, &quot;It is impossible, after the wonders you have shown in &quot;Pamela&quot;, to question your infallible success in this new, natural, attempt&quot; and that &quot;you must give me leave to be astonished, when you tell me that you have finished it already&quot;. However, the novel was not complete to Richardson&#x27;s satisfaction until October 1746. Between 1744 and 1746, Richardson tried to find readers who could help him shorten the work, but his readers wanted to keep the work in its entirety. A frustrated Richardson wrote to Edward Young in November 1747:

Richardson did not devote all of his time just to working on his new novel, but was busy printing various works for other authors that he knew. In 1742, he printed the third edition of Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Tour through Great Britain&quot;. He filled his few further years with smaller works for his friends until 1748, when Richardson started helping Sarah Fielding and her friend Jane Collier to write novels. By 1748, Richardson was so impressed with Collier that he accepted her as the governess to his daughters. In 1753, she wrote &quot;An Essay on the Art of Ingeniously Tormenting&quot; with the help of Sarah Fielding and possibly James Harris or Richardson, and it was Richardson who printed the work. But Collier was not the only author to be helped by Richardson, as he printed an edition of Young&#x27;s &quot;Night Thoughts&quot; in 1749.

By 1748 his novel &quot;Clarissa&quot; was published in full: two volumes appeared in November 1747, two in April 1748, and three in December 1748. Unlike the novel, the author was not faring well at this time. By August 1748, Richardson was in poor health. He had a sparse diet that consisted mostly of vegetables and drinking vast amounts of water, and was not robust enough to prevent the effects of being bled upon the advice of various doctors throughout his life. He was known for &quot;vague &#x27;startings&#x27; and &#x27;paroxysms&#x27;&quot;, along with experiencing tremors. Richardson once wrote to a friend that &quot;my nervous disorders will permit me to write with more impunity than to read&quot; and that writing allowed him a &quot;freedom he could find nowhere else&quot;.
However, his condition did not stop him from continuing to release the final volumes &quot;Clarissa&quot; after November 1748. To Hill he wrote: &quot;The Whole will make Seven; that is, one more to attend these two. Eight crouded into Seven, by a smaller Type. Ashamed as I am of the Prolixity, I thought I owed the Public Eight Vols. in Quantity for the Price of Seven&quot;. Richardson later made it up to the public with &quot;deferred Restorations&quot; of the fourth edition of the novel being printed in larger print with eight volumes and a preface that reads: &quot;It is proper to observe with regard to the &quot;present Edition&quot; that it has been thought fit to restore many Passages, and several Letters which were omitted in the former merely for shortening-sake.&quot;

The response to the novel was positive, and the public began to describe the title heroine as &quot;divine Clarissa&quot;. It was soon considered Richardson&#x27;s &quot;masterpiece&quot;, his greatest work, and was rapidly translated into French in part or in full, for instance by the abbé Antoine François Prévost, as well as into German. The Dutch translator of &quot;Clarissa&quot; was the distinguished Mennonite preacher, Johannes Stinstra (1708–1790), who as a champion of Socinianism had been suspended from the ministry in 1742. This gave him sufficient leisure to translate &quot;Clarissa&quot;, which was published in eight volumes between 1752–1755. However, Stinstra later wrote in a letter to Richardson of 24 December 1753 that the translation had been &quot;a burden too heavy for [his] shoulders&quot;. In England there was particular emphasis on Richardson&#x27;s &quot;natural creativity&quot; and his ability to incorporate daily life experience into the novel. However, the final three volumes were delayed, and many of the readers began to &quot;anticipate&quot; the concluding story and some demanded that Richardson write a happy ending. One such advocate of the happy ending was Henry Fielding, who had previously written &quot;Joseph Andrews&quot; to mock Richardson&#x27;s &quot;Pamela&quot;. Although Fielding was originally opposed to Richardson, Fielding supported the original volumes of &quot;Clarissa&quot; and thought a happy ending would be &quot;poetical justice&quot;. Those who disagreed included the Sussex diarist Thomas Turner, writing in about July 1754: &quot;&quot;Clarissa Harlow&quot; [sic], I look upon as a very well-wrote thing, tho&#x27; it must be allowed it is too prolix. The author keeps up the character of every person in all places; and as to the maner [sic] of its ending, I like it better than if it had terminated in more happy consequences.&quot;

Others wanted Lovelace to be reformed and for him and Clarissa to marry, but Richardson would not allow a &quot;reformed rake&quot; to be her husband, and was unwilling to change the ending. In a postscript to &quot;Clarissa&quot;, Richardson wrote:

Although few were bothered by the epistolary style, Richardson feels obliged to continue his postscript with a defence of the form based on the success of it in &quot;Pamela&quot;.
However, some did question the propriety of having Lovelace, the villain of the novel, act in such an immoral fashion. The novel avoids glorifying Lovelace, as Carol Flynn puts it,

But Richardson still felt the need to respond by writing a pamphlet called &quot;Answer to the Letter of a Very Reverend and Worthy Gentleman&quot;. In the pamphlet, he defends his characterizations and explains that he took great pains to avoid any glorification of scandalous behaviour, unlike the authors of many other novels that rely on characters of such low quality.

In 1749, Richardson&#x27;s female friends started asking him to create a male figure as virtuous as his heroines &quot;Pamela&quot; and &quot;Clarissa&quot; in order to &quot;give the world his idea of a good man and fine gentleman combined&quot;. Although he did not at first agree, he eventually complied, starting work on a book in this vein in June 1750. Near the end of 1751, Richardson sent a draft of the novel &quot;The History of Sir Charles Grandison&quot; to Mrs. Donnellan, and the novel was being finalized in the middle of 1752. When the novel was being printed in 1753, Richardson discovered that Irish printers were trying to pirate the work. He immediately fired those he suspected of giving the printers advanced copies of &quot;Grandison&quot; and relied on multiple London printing firms to help him produce an authentic edition before the pirated version was sold. The first four volumes were published on 13 November 1753, and in December the next two would follow. The remaining volume was published in March to complete a seven-volume series while a six-volume set was simultaneously published, and these met with success. In &quot;Grandison&quot;, Richardson was unwilling to risk having a negative response to any &quot;rakish&quot; characteristics that Lovelace embodied, and denigrated the immoral characters &quot;to show those mischievous young admirers of Lovelace once and for all that the rake should be avoided&quot;.

===Death===

In his final years, Richardson received visits from the Archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Secker, other important political figures, and many London writers. By that time, he enjoyed a high social position and was Master of the Stationers&#x27; Company. In early November 1754, Richardson and his family moved from the Grange to a home at Parsons Green, now in west London. During this time Richardson received a letter from Samuel Johnson asking for money to pay a debt that Johnson was unable to afford. On 16 March 1756, Richardson responded with more than enough money and their friendship was certain by this time.

At the same time as he was associating with important figures of the day, Richardson&#x27;s career as a novelist drew to a close. &quot;Grandison&quot; was his final novel, and he stopped writing fiction afterwards. It was &quot;Grandison&quot; that set the tone for Richardson&#x27;s followers after his death. However, he was continually prompted by various friends and admirers to continue to write along with suggested topics. Richardson did not like any of the topics, and chose to spend all of his time composing letters to his friends and associates. The only major work that Richardson would write would be &quot;A Collection of the Moral and Instruction Sentiments, Maxims, Cautions, and Reflexions, contained in the Histories of Pamela, Clarissa, and Sir Charles Grandison&quot;. Although it is possible that this work was inspired by Johnson asking for an &quot;index rerum&quot; for Richardson&#x27;s novels, the &quot;Collection&quot; contains more of a focus on &quot;moral and instructive&quot; lessons than the index that Johnson sought.

After June 1758, Richardson began to suffer from insomnia, and in June 1761, he was afflicted with apoplexy. This moment was described by his friend, Miss Talbot, on 2 July 1761:

Two days later, aged 71, on 4 July 1761, Richardson died at Parsons Green and was buried at St. Bride&#x27;s Church in Fleet Street near his first wife Martha.

During Richardson&#x27;s life, his printing press produced about 10,000 pieces, including novels, historical texts, Acts of Parliament, and newspapers, making his print house one of the most productive and diverse in the 18th century. He wanted to keep the press in his family, but after the death of his four sons and a nephew, his printing press would be left in his will to his only surviving male heir, a second nephew. This happened to be a nephew whom Richardson did not trust, doubting his abilities as a printer. Richardson&#x27;s fears proved well-founded, for after his death the press stopped producing quality works and eventually stopped printing altogether. Richardson owned copyrights to most of his works, and these were sold after his death, in twenty-fourth share issues, with shares in &quot;Clarissa&quot; bringing in 25 pounds each and those for &quot;Grandison&quot; bringing in 20 pounds each. Shares in &quot;Pamela&quot;, sold in sixteenths, went for 18 pounds each.

The first full biography of Richardson was written by Clara Linklater Thomson and published in 1900, and is credited with bringing &quot;Richardson back into view as a major novelist at a time when he was no longer being read&quot;. 

==Epistolary novel==
Richardson was a skilled letter writer and his talent traces back to his childhood. Throughout his whole life, he would constantly write to his various associates. Richardson had a &quot;faith&quot; in the act of letter writing, and believed that letters could be used to accurately portray character traits. He quickly adopted the epistolary novel form, which granted him &quot;the tools, the space, and the freedom to develop distinctly different characters speaking directly to the reader&quot;. The epistolary form gave Richardson, as well as others, the means to impact his audience more effectively as readers were able to get a more intimate insight into a novel&#x27;s characters. This allowed a stronger sense of engagement with the text to develop. Richardson structured his epistolary work to offer multiple perspectives so readers could interpret the text in varied ways. However, Richardson &quot;hoped he would eventually convince his audience to read in the ways that he chose—ways that he hoped would lead to moral regeneration.&quot; These epistolary novels were a &quot;moral project&quot; as well as a literary one; Susan Whyman writes that Richardson&#x27;s &quot;goal was not only to reform reading practices but to reform lives as well.&quot;

In his first novel, &quot;Pamela&quot;, he explored the various complexities of the title character&#x27;s life, and the letters allow the reader to witness her develop and progress over time. The novel was an experiment, but it allowed Richardson to create a complex heroine through a series of her letters. When Richardson wrote &quot;Clarissa&quot;, he had more experience in the form and expanded the letter writing to four different correspondents, which created a complex system of characters encouraging each other to grow and develop over time. However, the villain of the story, Lovelace, is also involved in the letter writing, and this leads to tragedy. Leo Braudy described the benefits of the epistolary form of &quot;Clarissa&quot; as, &quot;Language can work: letters can be ways to communicate and justify&quot;. By the time Richardson writes &quot;Grandison&quot;, he transforms the letter writing from telling of personal insights and explaining feelings into a means for people to communicate their thoughts on the actions of others and for the public to celebrate virtue. The letters are no longer written for a few people, but are passed along in order for all to see. The characters of &quot;Pamela&quot;, &quot;Clarissa&quot;, and &quot;Grandison&quot; are revealed in a personal way, with the first two using the epistolary form for &quot;dramatic&quot; purposes, and the last for &quot;celebratory&quot; purposes.

<doc id="65143" wikidata="Q6252" url="?curid=65143" title="Monza">
<text>Monza (, ; ; , locally ; ) is a city and &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) on the River Lambro, a tributary of the River Po, in the Lombardy region of Italy, about north-northeast of Milan. It is the capital of the province of Monza and Brianza. Monza is best known for its Grand Prix motor racing circuit, the , which hosts the Formula One Italian Grand Prix.On 11 June 2004, Monza was designated the capital of the new province of Monza and Brianza. The new administrative arrangement came fully into effect in summer 2009; previously, Monza was a &quot;comune&quot; within the province of Milan. Monza is the third-largest city of Lombardy and is the most important economic, industrial and administrative centre of the Brianza area, supporting a textile industry and a publishing trade. Monza also hosts a department of the University of Milano-Bicocca, a Court of Justice and several offices of regional administration. Monza Park is one of the largest urban parks in Europe.

== Geography and topography ==
Monza is located in the high plains of Lombardy, between Brianza and Milan, at an altitude of above sea level. It is from the centre of the region&#x27;s capital, although when considering the cities borders, they are separated by less than . Monza is about from Lecco and Como. Monza shares its position with Milan in the same metro area, and is a big part of its new province.

Monza is crossed from north to south by the Lambro. The river enters Monza from the north, between Via Aliprandi and Via Zanzi streets. This is an artificial fork of the river, created for defensive purposes in the early decades of the 14th century. The fork is known as Lambretto and it rejoins the main course of the Lambro as it exits to the south, leaving Monza through the now-demolished ancient circle of medieval walls. Another artificial stream is the Canale Villoresi, which was constructed in the late 19th century.

Monza has a typical submediterranean climate of the Po valley, with cool, short winters and warm summers; temperatures are very similar to nearby Milan, averaging in January, the coldest month, to about in July, the warmest. Precipitation is abundant, with most occurring in the autumn and the least in winter and summer; despite this, the city and surrounding area usually does not suffer drought in any season.

== History ==

=== Prehistory and ancient era ===


Funerary urns found in the late 19th century show that humans were in the area dating at the least to the Bronze Age, when people would have lived in pile dwelling settlements raised above the rivers and marshes.

During the Roman Empire, Monza was known as Modicia. During the 3rd century BCE, the Romans subdued the Insubres, a Gaul tribe that had crossed the Alps and settled around Mediolanum (now Milan). A Gallo-Celtic tribe, perhaps the Insubres themselves, founded a village on the Lambro. The ruins of a Roman bridge named &quot;Ponte d&#x27;Arena&quot; can be seen near today&#x27;s &quot;Ponte dei Leoni&quot; (Lions Bridge).

=== Middle Ages ===
Theodelinda, daughter of Garibald I of Bavaria and wife of the Lombard king Authari (and later of king Agilulf), chose Monza as her summer residence. Here in 595 she founded an &quot;oraculum&quot; dedicated to St. John the Baptist. According to the legend, Theodelinda, asleep while her husband was hunting, saw a dove in a dream that told her: &quot;modo&quot; (Latin for &quot;here&quot;) indicating that she should build the oraculum in that place, and the queen answered &quot;etiam&quot;, meaning &quot;yes&quot;. According to this legend, the medieval name of Monza, &quot;Modoetia&quot;, is derived from these two words. She also had a palace (the future Royal palace) built here.

Berengar I of Italy (850–924) located his headquarters in Monza. A fortified castrum was constructed to resist the incursions of the Hungarians. Under Berengar&#x27;s reign, Monza enjoyed a certain degree of independence: it had its own system of weights and measures, and could also seize property and mark the deeds with their signatures. Berengar was very generous evident by the donation of numerous works to the Monza Cathedral, including the famous cross, and by giving large benefits to its 32 canons and other churches.

In 980 Monza hosted Emperor Otto II inside the walled city. The Glossary of Monza, one of the earliest examples of the evolution of the Italian language, probably dates to the early 10th century. In 1000 Emperor Otto III became the protector of Monza and its possessions: Bulciago, Cremella, Lurago, Locate and Garlate.

In 1018, Aribert (970–1045), Lord of Monza, was consecrated bishop of Milan, resulting in the city losing its independence from its rival. These years saw a power struggle between the emperor Conrad II, and Aribert. When the emperor died, he left important donations to the church of Monza.

In the 12th century, it is estimated that the city of Monza had about 7,000 inhabitants. Agriculture was the main occupation, although crafts had begun to grow in importance. In 1128 Conrad III of Hohenstaufen was crowned King of Italy in the Church of San Michele at Monza.

In 1136 emperor Lothair III guaranteed the independence of the clergy of Monza from Milan. Monza subsequently regained its autonomy, which was not limited to the feudal government of lands and goods; the archpriest of Monza was confirmed the authority of the clergy of his church (year 1150). This autonomy was never absolute, as the church of Monza was not able to completely cut its ties with the bishop of Milan.

Frederick I Barbarossa visited Monza twice (1158 and 1163). During this period the city again regained its independence from Milan, a city hostile to the emperor. Frederick declared that Monza was his property and also gave the &quot;Curraria&quot; (the right to levy customs on the streets), a right usually granted only to royal seats.

During the period of the struggle against Milan and other cities of the Lombard League, Monza was primarily an administrative centre for Barbarossa. Monzan independence lasted until 1185 when Barbarossa ended the conflict with the Lombard League with the peace of Constance. He allowed the city of Milan to self-rule its subjects again while taking possession of the treasury of the cathedral.

In 1185 Henry VI, son of Barbarossa, was crowned king at Monza, on the occasion of his marriage to Queen Constanza of Sicily, heir to the Norman kingdom.

As early as the 12th century, Monza was a fortified place, although the status of free city had changed its economical role. Agricultural activities were now paired by the production of clothes, while wool processing developed on large farms outside the walls.

Monza was increasingly linked to events of Milan and shared its history and enemies: in 1255 the city was sacked by the Ghibellines, and in 1259 and Ezzelino III da Romano tried to seize the castle of Monza but was repelled; the village was set on fire.

After the decisive 1277 victory of the Visconti at the Battle of Desio, Monza was occupied by Archbishop Ottone Visconti and the Marquis of Montferrat, William VII (1278). The following year, the town was declared a possession of the people of Milan.

=== 14th–17th centuries ===

In 1312, Monza adhered to the Ghibelline faction.

Enrico Aliprandi, a member of a family of Monza, joined the Torriani faction, with many enlisted soldiers under his command. He was acclaimed Lord of Monza by the people in 1322. The same year, Luchino Visconti and Francesco Garbagnate demolished the walls of Monza to prevent it from defending itself against attacks from the Milanese.

In 1325 Galeazzo I Visconti, who conquered the city after a long siege, began the construction of new defences. Among the projects was the bifurcation of the River Lambro (the &quot;Lambretto&quot; branch) and the construction of a castle, the third in Monza. It included a tall-tower, later used as a jail (&quot;Forni&quot;). The Castle of Monza was later expanded to such a degree that it was necessary to demolish the St. Mary of Ingino church as space was needed for new buildings. Two other towers were also built along the River Lambro. In 1327 Galeazzo himself was imprisoned in the &quot;Forni&quot;, by order of emperor Louis IV. He was released the next year.

In April 1329, the condottiero Pinalla Aliprandi regained Monza from the imperial troops. Azzone Visconti allowed the reconstruction of the walls, beginning in 1333 and lasting until 1381. Martino Aliprandi was &quot;podestà&quot; of Monza from 1334 to 1336, overseeing the construction of the walls and the fortification of the fortress.

In 1354 Pope Innocent VI proclaimed the undisputed right to impose, in the Cathedral of Monza, the Crown of Italy, the Iron Crown. In 1380 Gian Galeazzo Visconti donated the castle to his wife Catherine, who died there after having been jailed by her son Giovanni Maria (1404). In 1407 Estorre Visconti was proclaimed Lord of Monza and began minting Monza&#x27;s own coinage.

Antonio de Leyva, the Spanish governor of Milan and commander of the imperial troops, sacked the city in 1527. In the same year, a mine exploded causing the partial destruction of the Castle of Monza. De Leyva became Lord of Monza in 1529, devoting himself to the government regulation of ecclesiastical affairs, controlling their taxes and duties and shutting the doors of those who did not pay. His relative Marianna de Leyva was the inspiration to Alessandro Manzoni for his Nun of Monza.

The plague, which struck Monza in 1576 and 1630, caused a profound demographic and economic crisis. In 1648, Monza and its territory became the property of the Milanese Durini family.

The Duchy of Milan and Monza remained subject to the Spanish crown until the early 18th century.

=== 18th century ===

At the end of the War of the Spanish Succession (1713), the Duchy of Milan was assigned to the House of Habsburg of Austria. This historical period is a season of rebirth of the city, with a considerable development of agriculture and crafts.

Empress Maria Theresa built the Royal Villa of Monza for her son Ferdinand, Governor of Milan (1777–1780). The choice of Monza was due not only to the beauty of the landscape, but also its strategic position and the fact that it was connected to Vienna as well as its proximity to Milan. The construction was completed in three years with design by architect Giuseppe Piermarini from Foligno.

At the conclusion of the Italian campaign of Napoleon Bonaparte (1796), the Duchy of Milan was acquired first by the French Republic and then entered the Cisalpine Republic (which, in 1802, became the Italian Republic).

=== 19th century ===
Considered by the French as a symbol of aristocratic power, the Royal Villa was destined for demolition. However, the protests of citizens stopped the process, although the abandonment caused the complex to decay.

Two-thirds of the gold and silver treasures of the Monza Cathedral were delivered to the mint of Milan, which turned them into coins used for military expenses. Bonaparte also took possession of the treasures of the Basilica and the Chapter Library books, and transferred them to the National Library in Paris. The Iron Crown was left provisionally in Monza.

In 1805, the Italian Republic became the Kingdom of Italy with its capital in Milan. On 26 May 1805, the Iron Crown was in Milan for the coronation of Napoleon Bonaparte, who put it on his head, uttering the famous phrase &quot;God gave it to me, woe to anyone who touches it.&quot; Napoleon also established the Order of the Iron Crown. Monza received the title of Imperial City. The Viceroy of Italy, Eugène de Beauharnais, was appointed in August 1805 and he settled in the Villa of Monza. In 1807 the castle was demolished.

In the fall of the First Empire (1815), Austria annexed the Italian territories to the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia, Monza being included in the province of Milan. The Monzesi asked for the restoration of all the treasures taken by the French. In 1816 the city returned the possession of the books of the Treasury and Chapter Library. The Crown of Agilulf, however, had been melted in Paris.

The next emperor Ferdinand I of Austria had himself crowned King of Lombardy and Venetia in Milan with the Iron Crown (6 September 1838), with the opportunity to extend various benefits to the city. New roads are opened, including the King Ferdinand road (now Via Vittorio Emanuele), while in 1842 the Bridge of Lions was erected near the old Roman bridge. In 1841 the first railway connecting Milan and Monza was inaugurated.

Monza took part in the Five Days of Milan (22–23 March 1848) Monza, expelling the Austrian garrison. The Austrians returned in 1849.

In 1859, at the end of the Second Italian War of Independence, Lombardy became part of the Kingdom of Sardinia. But the treasure and the Iron Crown had been transferred to Vienna by the Austrians and was returned to Monza only after the conclusion of the Third War of Italian Independence (December 1866).

On 31 December 1895 Monza had about 37,500 permanent inhabitants. The economy was based on the production of wheat, corn, fodder, potatoes, oats, rye and vegetables in general. Another source of wealth was the breeding of silkworms.

In 1900 Monza was the scene of the assassination of King Umberto I by anarchist Gaetano Bresci. To commemorate the spot of the crime, his successor Victor Emmanuel III ordered the construction of an Expiatory Chapel on Via Matteo da Campione.

=== 20th century ===
At the beginning of the century, Monza counted 41,200 inhabitants; in 1911 it was among the eight most industrialised centres of Italy. The main activities were related to the processing of cotton, mechanics, hat factories and industries.

Between the two world wars, the city&#x27;s industrial structure did not undergo substantial change while recording significant increases in production volumes. The Autodromo (1922) and a golf course (1925) were built in the park.

The Second World War, between 1940 and 1945, caused several bombings of Monza, with civilian casualties; after the September 1943 Italian Armistice, the area was occupied by the Germans.

In the second half of the century, the city experienced a significant increase in population and subsequent building development. With the development of various activities occurring problems related to traffic and links to nearby towns, especially with Milan.



=== 21st century ===
At the beginning of the century, Monza had about 120,000 inhabitants. The city became the capital of the Province of Monza and Brianza on 11 June 2004. In 2009–2013 a tunnel was built to supplement the Viale Lombardia (SS36 national road), one of the busiest streets in Europe.

== Government ==
== Main sights ==
In the course of its history, Monza withstood thirty-two sieges, but the Porta d&#x27;Agrate is all that remains of its original walls and fortifications. Nearby is the nunnery in which the Nun of Monza was enclosed in Manzoni&#x27;s &quot;I Promessi Sposi&quot;.

Monza is known for its Romanesque-Gothic style Cathedral of Saint John (&quot;Duomo&quot;). The black-and-white marble arcaded façade was erected in the mid-14th century by Matteo da Campione. The campanile was erected in 1606 to designs by Pellegrino Tibaldi.

The cathedral encloses the &quot;Chapel of Theodelinda&quot;, a centrally-planned Greek-cross &quot;oraculum&quot; (&quot;chapel of prayer&quot;) dated to . The foundations remain under the crossing of nave and transept, but at the close of the 13th century, the chapel was enlarged by enclosing the former atrium within the building. The frescoed chapel houses the Iron Crown of Lombardy, said to include one of the nails used at the Crucifixion of Jesus. The treasury also contains the crown, fan and gold comb of Theodelinda, and, as well as Gothic crosses and reliquaries, a golden hen and seven chickens, representing Lombardy and her seven provinces. Though the interior has suffered changes, there is a fine relief by Matteo da Campione representing a royal Lombard coronation, and some 15th-century frescoes with scenes from the life of Theodelinda.

The historical centre also includes the following buildings:
*Santa Maria in Strada: a medieval church with a rich terra-cotta façade (1393)
*&quot;Broletto&quot; or &quot;Arengario&quot;: the 14th-century palace of the civic commune, raised on an arcade of pointed arches, with a tall square machiolated tower terminating in a sharp central cone.
*San Pietro Martire
*Santa Maria delle Grazie: 15th-century church
*Oratory of St. Gregory (17th century)
*Santa Maria al Carrobiolo: 16th-century church
*Expiatory Chapel of Monza (&quot;Cappella Espiatoria&quot;): Memorial chapel built in 1900 in memory of the assassinated King Umberto I of Italy

=== Monza Circuit ===
Monza is internationally known for the motor racing circuit, home to the Italian Grand Prix usually held in September, and previously to the Alfa Romeo team. Meanwhile, the Golf Club Milano is a golf course that has hosted nine editions of the Italian Open. Both are located inside the Monza Park, which comprises 688 ha.

The Italian Grand Prix has been hosted at the Monza circuit in every single year of Formula One history bar one (1980), and although no Italian has won the race since Ludovico Scarfiotti in 1966, the local support is for the Ferrari team, which has taken many historical wins on the circuit, especially with Michael Schumacher winning five times between 1996 and 2006. The event also saw Jody Scheckter secure the 1979 title in that event among other historical wins such as the Ferrari 1-2 finish against the odds in 1988. The Ferrari fans at Monza are known both in Italian and internationally as &quot;tifosi&quot;. Aside from Ferrari, another Italian milestone at the venue was German 21-year old Sebastian Vettel taking his and Italian team Scuderia Toro Rosso&#x27;s first win in torrential rain in 2008.

The event has been marred by tragedy several times, involving driver fatalities such as Wolfgang von Trips, Jochen Rindt and Ronnie Peterson, but also a fatal accident involving a trackside marshal in 2000, and multiple spectators being killed in von Trips&#x27; fatal accident in 1961. Monza is an extremely fast circuit that has been modified with three chicanes to curb speeds, but is still the fastest circuit on the Formula One calendar and is considered too fast to be considered to host MotoGP and no longer holds Superbike World Championship events either. When it hosted the Italian motorcycle Grand Prix it saw a double fatal accident for Jarno Saarinen and Renzo Pasolini in 1973 after a pile-up through the dauntingly fast &quot;Curva Grande&quot;, that has since had significant runoff added to it. Italy&#x27;s last Formula One champion Alberto Ascari also died at the Monza circuit in 1955, but it was during a test of a road car rather than during a race.

=== Other ===
Monza&#x27;s professional football club, AC Monza, play at the Stadio Brianteo. They were promoted to the , the top flight of Italian football, in 2022. AC Monza&#x27;s under-19 team also plays in the top youth division (Primavera 1).

Monza-based Volley Milano plays in the Serie A1, the top division for men&#x27;s volleyball in Italy, since 2014. They play at the Monza Arena. Their women&#x27;s team also plays at the Monza Arena in the women&#x27;s Serie A1.

In 2006 Monza hosted the World Cyber Games tournament. In 2005 and 2008, Monza hosted the &quot;International Gran Galà Marching Show Bands&quot; at Stadio Brianteo (with the USA band Blue Devils, 11 times WMSB Champion of the World).

== Transport ==

=== Rail ===
Monza railway station is the most important railway junction in the Brianza area. Travel between Monza and Milan via the Milan - Monza railway can be made both with suburban (lines S7, S8, S9 and S11) and regional trains, that furthermore connect Monza to Lecco/Sondrio, Como, Chiasso/Lugano (CH), Bergamo and Saronno (via the Saronno - Seregno railway). Also, some EuroCity trains stop in Monza. In early 2008, work began on the expansion of Milan subway Line M1 from Sesto San Giovanni to Monza Bettola, while works for the Line M5 extension from Milan to Monza railway station and the rest of the city, with 8 new stops through the city of Monza, started in 2024. 

Monza railway station is located on Enrico Arosio Road, on the southern edge of the historic city centre.

=== Roads ===
Monza can be reached through the following motorways: A4-E64 (Turin-Milan-Venice), A52 (North Ring of Milan), A51 (East Ring of Milan). State road (SS36 – Nuova Valassina) connects the city to Lecco and Sondrio. A long tunnel has been added to try and alleviate traffic problems that are happening in the city.

<doc id="65145" wikidata="Q12881" url="?curid=65145" title="Paulo Coelho">
<text>Paulo Coelho de Souza ( , ; born 24 August 1947) is a Brazilian lyricist and novelist and a member of the Brazilian Academy of Letters since 2002. His 1988 novel &quot;The Alchemist&quot; became an international best-seller.

==Early life==
Paulo Coelho was born on 24 August 1947 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and attended a Jesuit school. At age 17, Coelho&#x27;s parents committed him to a mental institution from which he escaped three times before being released at the age of 20. Coelho later remarked that &quot;It wasn&#x27;t that they wanted to hurt me, but they didn&#x27;t know what to do... They did not do that to destroy me, they did that to save me.&quot;

On his parents&#x27; wishes, Coelho enrolled in law school and abandoned his dream of becoming a writer. One year later, he dropped out and lived life as a hippie, travelling through South America, North Africa, Mexico, and Europe and started using drugs in the 1960s.

==Career==
===Songwriting===
Upon his return to Brazil, Coelho worked as a songwriter, composing lyrics for Elis Regina, Rita Lee, and Brazilian icon Raul Seixas. Composing with Raul led to Coelho being associated with magic and occultism, due to the content of some songs. He is often accused that these songs were rip-offs of foreign songs not well known in Brazil at the time. In 1974, by his account, he was arrested for &quot;subversive&quot; activities and tortured by the ruling military government, who had taken power ten years earlier and viewed his lyrics as left-wing and dangerous. Coelho also worked as an actor, journalist and theatre director before pursuing his writing career.

In 1986 Coelho walked the 500-plus mile Road of Santiago de Compostela in northwestern Spain. On the path, he had a spiritual awakening, which he described autobiographically in &quot;The Pilgrimage&quot;. In an interview, Coelho stated &quot;[In 1986], I was very happy in the things I was doing. I was doing something that gave me food and water – to use the metaphor in &quot;The Alchemist&quot;, I was working, I had a person whom I loved, I had money, but I was not fulfilling my dream. My dream was, and still is, to be a writer.&quot; Coelho would leave his lucrative career as a songwriter and pursue writing full-time.

===Writing===
In 1982, Coelho published his first book, &quot;Hell Archives&quot;, which failed to make a substantial impact. In 1986 he contributed to the &quot;Practical Manual of Vampirism&quot;, although he later tried to take it off the shelves since he considered it &quot;of bad quality.&quot; After making the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela in 1986, Coelho wrote &quot;The Pilgrimage&quot;, published in 1987.

While trying to overcome his procrastination about launching his writing career, Coelho decided, &quot;If I see a white feather today, that is a sign that God is giving me that I have to write a new book.&quot; Seeing one in the window of a shop, he began writing that day. The following year, Coelho wrote &quot;The Alchemist&quot; and published it through a small Brazilian publishing house that made an initial print run of 900 copies and decided not to reprint it. He subsequently found a bigger publishing house, and with the publication of his next book &quot;Brida&quot;, &quot;The Alchemist&quot; took off. HarperCollins decided to publish the book in 1994. Later it became an international bestseller. In a 2009 interview with the Syrian &quot;Forward Magazine&quot;, Coelho stated that the Sufi tradition had been an influence on him, particularly when writing &quot;The Alchemist&quot; and later &quot;The Zahir&quot;.

Since the publication of &quot;The Alchemist&quot;, Coelho has generally written at least one novel every two years. Four of them – &quot;The Pilgrimage&quot;, &quot;Hippie&quot;, &quot;The Valkyries&quot; and&quot; Aleph&quot; – are autobiographical, while the majority of the rest are broadly fictional. Other books, like &quot;Maktub&quot;, &quot;The Manual of the Warrior of Light&quot; and &quot;Like the Flowing River&quot;, are collections of essays, newspaper columns, or selected teachings. His work has been published in more than 170 countries and translated into eighty-three languages. Together, his books have sold 320 million copies.
On 22 December 2016, Coelho was listed by UK-based company Richtopia at number 2 in the list of 200 most influential contemporary authors.

==Reception==
Reactions to his writing have not been without dissension. Though he was raised in a Catholic family and describes himself as of that faith even now, his stance has been described as incompatible with the Catholic faith, because of its New Age, pantheist and relativist contents. And whatever his sales, reviews of Coelho&#x27;s later work consistently note its superficiality.

In 2016, he was contacted by basketball player Kobe Bryant, who wanted to discuss a children&#x27;s book project with him. Some months before Bryant&#x27;s death in a helicopter crash in January 2020, they started to write the book together, but upon hearing about his death, Coelho deleted the draft, saying in an interview that &quot;it didn&#x27;t make any sense to publish without him.&quot; He did not say how many pages had been written or whether the book had a title.

==Film==
&quot;The Pilgrim – Story of Paulo Coelho&quot; is the international title for the biographical film &quot;Não Pare na Pista&quot;, a co-production between Brazil’s Drama Films and the Spanish Babel Films, in which the younger and older Coelho are played by two different actors. One of the producers, Iôna de Macêdo, told &quot;Screen International&quot;: &quot;The film tells the story of a man who has a dream. It&#x27;s a little like &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; – he&#x27;s someone who is too big for his house.&quot; The film, shot in Portuguese, had its premiere in Brazilian theatres in 2014 and was internationally distributed in 2015.

==Personal life==
Coelho married artist Christina Oiticica in 1980. Together they had previously spent half the year in Rio de Janeiro and the other half in a French country house in the Pyrenees, but now the couple resides permanently in Geneva, Switzerland.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Greece ====
* Philip II of Macedon decides to attack the Scythians, using as an excuse their reluctance to allow Philip to dedicate a statue of Heracles at the Danube estuary. The two armies clash on the plains of modern-day Dobruja. The ninety-year-old King of the Scythians, Ateas, is killed during the battle and his army is routed.
* During a meeting of the Amphictyonic Council, Philip accuses the citizens of the town of Amfissa, in Locris, of intruding on consecrated ground. The Amphictyonic Congress, with the initial support of the Athenian representative, Aeschines, decides to inflict a harsh punishment upon the Locrians. After the failure of a first military excursion against the Locrians, the summer session of the Amphictyonic Council gives command of the league&#x27;s forces to Philip and asks him to lead a second excursion. Philip acts at once, and his forces pass through Thermopylae, enter Amfissa and defeat the Locrians who are led by Chares, the Athenian general and mercenary commander.
* Xenocrates is elected as head of the Greek Academy replacing Speusippus.

==== Roman Republic ====
* The Roman consul Titus Manlius Imperiosus Torquatus defeats the Latins in the Battle of Trifanum.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Alexinus, Greek philosopher of Elis (approximate date)

== Deaths ==
* Speusippus, head of Plato&#x27;s Academy (b. 407 BC)
* Ateas, king of the Scythians (b. c. 429 BC)

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Persian Empire ====
* Rhodes falls to Persian forces.
* Pixodarus, the youngest of the three sons of King Hecatomnus of Caria, gains possession of the satrapy of Caria by expelling his sister Ada, the widow and successor of her brother Idrieus.

==== Greece ====
* When King Philip II of Macedon invaded Perinthus and Byzantium, King Artaxerxes III of Persia sent support to those cities.
* Philip II fails in his siege of Byzantium and is forced to respond to attacks by the Scythians near the mouth of the Danube. His son, Alexander is regent while his father fights against Byzantium and the Scythians.
* The Athenians give Demosthenes a public vote of thanks after Philip&#x27;s unsuccessful siege of Byzantium.
* Derveni papyrus in a nobleman&#x27;s grave in a necropolis of Lete.

==== Sicily ====
*Hicetas, the tyrant of Leontini, again persuades Carthage to send a large army to Sicily, which lands at Lilybaeum. Timoleon of Syracuse meets this large Carthaginian army in the Battle of the Crimissus in the west of Sicily and achieves a brilliant victory against superior odds. Despite this victory, the Carthaginians continue to occupy the western half of Sicily, with a treaty being concluded that confines the Carthaginians to the area west of the Halycus (Platani) River.

==== Roman Republic ====
* An embassy is sent by the Latin peoples to the Roman Senate asking for the formation of a single republic between Rome and Latium, in which both parties would be considered to be equal. As Rome considers that it is the leader of the Latin League, it refuses to treat the Latin people as being equal politically, or to have Latin people in the Roman Senate. With Rome&#x27;s refusal of the proposal, the Latin War begins. The Latins fight with the Campanians, while Rome joins the Samnites to attack the Latins. Only the Laurentes in Latium and the equites of Campania remain with the Romans, who, for their part, find support among the Paeligni.
* The Roman-Samnite army under consuls Publius Decius Mus and Titus Manlius Torquatus attack and defeat the Latins and Campanians near Mount Vesuvius in the Battle of Vesuvius.
* The Romans succeed in detaching the Campanians from their alliance with the Latins (through their fear of the Samnites) and induce them to make a separate peace. Three Campanian cities, including Capua and Cumae, are granted Roman citizenship and thus become part of the Roman state. The Roman state now extends to the Bay of Naples.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Appius Claudius Caecus, Roman politician and consul (approximate date)
* Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Maurya Empire (approximate date)
* Qu Yuan, Chinese poet and minister (approximate date)

== Deaths ==
* Lais of Hyccara, Greek hetaira (courtesan) (approximate date)
* Mentor of Rhodes, Greek mercenary and satrap (approximate date)
* Xuan of Chu, Chinese king of Chu (Warring States Period)

=== By place ===

==== Greece ====
* Returning to Macedonia by way of Delphi (where the Pythian priestess acclaims him &quot;invincible&quot;), King Alexander III of Macedonia advances into Thrace in order to secure the Danube as the northern boundary of the Macedonian kingdom. After forcing the Shipka Pass and crushing the Triballi, he crosses the Danube to disperse the Getae. Turning west, he then defeats and shatters a coalition of Illyrians who are invading Macedonia.
* A rumour that Alexander has been killed by the Illyrians leads the Thebans and Athenians to take up arms again. Alexander defeats the Greeks and razes Thebes. In Thebes, 6,000 people are killed and all survivors are sold into slavery.
* After conquering Thebes, Alexander demands the surrender of the mercenary commanders, Chares and Charidemus, among others. Chares escapes to the Troad while Charidemus is banished and flees to Persia.
* The admiration of Alexander for the Athenian orator and diplomat, Demades, leads the conqueror to treat Athens leniently despite its involvement in the rebellion. A special Athenian embassy led by Phocion, an opponent of the anti-Macedonian faction, is able to persuade Alexander to give up his demand for the exile of the leaders of the anti-Macedonian party, particularly Demosthenes.
* Aristotle returns to Athens from Macedon and opens a peripatetic school in an old gymnasium called the Lyceum. It contains a museum of natural history, zoological gardens and a library.

==== Roman Republic ====
* Marcus Valerius Corvus is elected consul of the Roman Republic for the fourth time.
* Cales (modern Calvi), a city in Campania, is taken by the Romans and a Roman colony is established there.

<text>Year 331 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Potitus and Marcellus (or, less frequently, year 423 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 331 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Macedonia ====

* Late January – Alexander the Great travels with a small bodyguard (among them is the future Egyptian ruler Ptolemy I Soter) along the coastal road of Egypt and reaches the settlement of Paraetonium on the borders of Cyrenaica. There, he receives a delegation of emissaries from Cyrene, who grants him a number of gifts including fine horses and chariots. Alexander concludes a treaty of peace and alliance with them. He turns inland from the Mediterranean and travels through the Libyan Desert to the Siwah Oasis, which he reaches in late February. Alexander consults the famous oracle and is pronounced the son of Zeus-Ammon as his true father.
* Alexander departs from Egypt and leads his forces towards Phoenicia. He leaves Cleomenes of Naucratis as the ruling nomarch to control Egypt.
* October 1 – Alexander is victorious in the Battle of Gaugamela (near ancient Ninevah) over the Persian King Darius III. Alexander pursues the defeated Persian forces to Arbela, Darius moves his Bactrian cavalry and Greek mercenaries into Media.
* For the first time, Alexander encounters war elephants after the battle in Darius&#x27; camp. In the capital, Susa, Alexander gains access to huge treasures amounting to 50,000 gold talents (equivalent of today circa 77 billion USD).

==== Greece ====
* From Thapsacus on the Euphrastes River, Alexander led the Greek army toward the Tigris River, leading to a victory over the Persians on October 31 at Gaugamela, after which Darius fled and escaped. 
* While Alexander is fighting in Asia, Agis III of Sparta, profiting from the Macedonian king&#x27;s absence from Greece, leads some of the Greek cities in a revolt. With Persian money and 8,000 Greek mercenaries, he holds Crete against Macedonian forces. In the Peloponnesus he routs a force under the Macedonian general Coragus and, although Athens stays neutral, he is joined by Elis, Achaea (except Pellene) and Arcadia, with the exception of Megalopolis, the staunchly anti-Spartan capital of Arcadia, which Agis III&#x27;s forces besiege.
* Alexander&#x27;s regent Antipater leads the Macedonians to victory over King Agis III in the Battle of Megalopolis.

==== Italy ====
* Alexander of Epirus takes Heraclea from the Lucanians, and Terina and Sipontum from the Bruttii.
* Tarentum turns against Alexander of Epirus when they realize that he intends to create a kingdom of his own in southern Italy. Alexander is defeated and killed in the Battle of Pandosia on the banks of the Acheron.

==== Roman Republic ====
* The Gallic tribe of the Senones and the Romans conclude a peace and enter upon a period of friendly relations which lasts the rest of the century.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;
== Births ==

== Deaths ==
* Alexander I of Epirus, Aeacid dynasty king of Epirus (b. c. 370 BC)
* Vahe, legendary king of Armenia and last of the Hyke dynasty

<text>Tahiti (; , ; ) is the largest island of the Windward group of the Society Islands in French Polynesia, an overseas collectivity of France. It is located in the central part of the Pacific Ocean and the nearest major landmass is the North Island of New Zealand. Divided into two parts, &quot;Tahiti Nui&quot; (bigger, northwestern part) and &quot;Tahiti Iti&quot; (smaller, southeastern part), the island was formed from volcanic activity; it is high and mountainous with surrounding coral reefs. Its population was 189,517 in 2017, making it by far the most populous island in French Polynesia and accounting for 68.7% of its total population; the 2022 Census recorded a population of 191,779.

Tahiti is the economic, cultural, and political centre of French Polynesia. The capital of French Polynesia, Papeete, is located on the northwest coast of Tahiti. The only international airport in the region, Faaā International Airport, is on Tahiti near Papeete. Tahiti was originally settled by Polynesians between . They represent about 70% of the island&#x27;s population, with the rest made up of Europeans, Chinese and those of mixed heritage. The island was part of the Kingdom of Tahiti until its annexation by France in 1880, when it was proclaimed a colony of France, and the inhabitants became French citizens. French is the sole official language, although the Tahitian language (&quot;Reo Tahiti&quot;) is also widely spoken.

Tahiti was called &quot;Otaheite&quot; in earlier European documents: this is a rendering of Tah. , which is typically pronounced .

The island is across at its widest point and covers an area of . The highest peak is Mont Orohena (Moua Orohena) (). Mount Roonui, or Mount Ronui (Moua Rōnui), in the southeast rises to . The island consists of two roughly round portions centered on volcanic mountains and connected by a short isthmus of Taravao.

The northwestern portion is known as &quot;Tahiti Nui&quot; (&quot;big Tahiti&quot;), while the much smaller southeastern portion is known as &quot;Tahiti Iti&quot; (&quot;small Tahiti&quot;) or &quot;Taiarapū&quot;. &quot;Tahiti Nui&quot; is heavily populated along the coast, especially around the capital, Papeete.

The interior of &quot;Tahiti Nui&quot; is almost entirely uninhabited. &quot;Tahiti Iti&quot; has remained isolated, as its southeastern half (&quot;Te Pari&quot;) is accessible only to those travelling by boat or on foot. The rest of the island is encircled by a main road which cuts between the mountains and the sea. Tahiti&#x27;s landscape features lush rainforests and many rivers and waterfalls, including the Papenoo on the north side and the Fautaua Falls near Papeete.

===Geology===

The Society archipelago is a hotspot volcanic chain consisting of ten islands and atolls. The chain is oriented along the N. 65° W. direction, parallel to the movement of the Pacific Plate. Due to the plate movement over the Society hotspot, the age of the islands decreases from 5 Ma at Maupiti to 0 Ma at Mehetia, where Mehetia is the inferred current location of the hotspot as evidenced by recent seismic activity. Maupiti, the oldest island in the chain, is a highly eroded shield volcano with at least 12 thin lava flows, which accumulated fairly rapidly between 4.79 and 4.05 Ma. Bora Bora is another highly eroded shield volcano consisting of basaltic lavas accumulated between 3.83 and 3.1 Ma. The lavas are intersected by post-shield dikes. Tahaa consists of shield-stage basalt with an age of 3.39 Ma, followed by additional eruptions 1.2 Ma later. Raiatea consists of shield-stage basalt followed by post-shield trachytic lava flows, all occurring from 2.75 to 2.29 Ma. Huahine consists of two coalesced basalt shield volcanoes, Huahine Nui and Huahine Iti, with several flows followed by post-shield trachyphonolitic lava domes from 3.08 to 2.06 Ma. Moorea consists of at least 16 flows of shield-stage basalt and post-shield lavas from 2.15 to 1.36 Ma. Tahiti consists of two basalt shield volcanoes, Tahiti Nui and Tahiti Iti, with an age range of 1.67 to 0.25 Ma.

== History ==
=== Geological history ===
About 1.4 million to 870,000 years ago, the island of Tahiti was formed as a volcanic shield.

=== Early settling of Tahiti ===

The first Tahitians arrived from Western Polynesia into the Society Islands sometime after ; some studies have proposed slightly later dates, . Linguistic, biological and archaeological evidence supports a long migration from Southeast Asia via the Fijian, Samoan and Tongan Archipelagos using outrigger canoes that were up to twenty or thirty metres long and could transport families as well as domestic animals.

=== Civilization before the arrival of the Europeans ===

Before the arrival of the Europeans, the island was divided into territories, each dominated by a single clan. The most important clans were the closely related Teva i Uta (Teva of the Interior) and the Teva i Tai (Teva of the Sea) whose combined territory extended from the peninsula in the south of Tahiti Nui.

Clan leadership consisted of a chief (&quot;arii rahi&quot;), nobles (&quot;arii&quot;), and under-chiefs (&quot;Īatoai&quot;). The arii were also the religious leaders, revered for the mana (spiritual power) they inherited as descendants of the gods. As symbols of their power, they wore belts of red feathers. Nonetheless, to exercise their political power, councils or general assemblies composed of the arii and the Īatoai had to be called, especially in case of war.

The chief&#x27;s spiritual power was also limited; each clan&#x27;s practice was organized around their &quot;marae&quot; (stone temple) and its priests.

=== First European visits ===
The first European to arrive at Tahiti may have been Spanish explorer Juan Fernández in his expedition of 1576–1577. Alternatively, Portuguese navigator Pedro Fernandes de Queirós, serving the Spanish Crown in an expedition to &quot;Terra Australis&quot;, was perhaps the first European to see Tahiti. He sighted an inhabited island on 10 February 1606. However, it has been suggested that he actually saw the island of Rekareka to the southeast of Tahiti. Hence, although the Spanish and Portuguese made contact with nearby islands, they may not have arrived at Tahiti.

The next stage of European visits to the region came during the period of intense Anglo-French rivalry that filled the twelve years between the Seven Years&#x27; War and the American Revolutionary War. The first of these visits, and perhaps the first European visit to Tahiti, was under the command of Captain Samuel Wallis. While circumnavigating the globe in , they sighted the island on 18 June 1767 and then harbored in Matavai Bay between the chiefdom Pare-Arue (governed by Tu (Tu-nui-e-aa-i-te-Atua) and his regent Tutaha) and the chiefdom Haapape, governed by Amo and his wife &quot;Oberea&quot; (Purea). The first contacts were violent, but to avert all-out war after a British show of force, Oberea laid down peace offerings leading to cordial relations.

On 2 April 1768, the expedition of Louis-Antoine de Bougainville, aboard and on the first French circumnavigation, sighted Tahiti. On 5 April, they anchored off Hitiaa O Te Ra and were welcomed by its chief Reti. Bougainville was also visited by Tutaha. Bougainville stayed about ten days.

By 12 April 1769 Captain James Cook had arrived in Tahiti&#x27;s Matavai Bay on a scientific mission with astronomy, botany, and artistic details. On 14 April Cook met Tutaha and Tepau and the next day he picked the site for a fortified camp at Point Venus for Charles Green&#x27;s observatory. Botanist Joseph Banks and artist Sydney Parkinson, along with Cook, gathered valuable information on fauna and flora as well as on native society, language and customs, including the proper name of the island. Cook also met many island chiefs. Cook and &quot;Endeavour&quot; left Tahiti on 13 July 1769. Cook estimated the population to be 200,000 including all the nearby islands in the chain. This estimate was reduced to 35,000 by Cook&#x27;s contemporary, anthropologist and Tahiti expert Douglas L. Oliver.

The Viceroy of Peru, Manuel de Amat y Juniet, under order of the Spanish Crown, organized an expedition to colonize the island in 1772. He would ultimately send three expeditions aboard the ship &quot;Aguila&quot;, the first two under the command of navigator Domingo de Bonechea. Four Tahitians, Pautu, Tipitipia, Heiao, and Tetuanui, accompanied Bonechea back to Peru in early 1773 after the first &quot;Aguila&quot; expedition.

Cook returned to Tahiti between 15 August and 1 September 1773. Greeted by the chiefs, Cook anchored in Vaitepiha Bay before returning to Point Venus. Cook left Tahiti on 14 May 1774.

Pautu and Tetuanui returned to Tahiti with Bonechea aboard &quot;Aguila&quot; on 14 November 1774; Tipitipia and Heiao had died. Bonechea died on 26 January 1775 in Tahiti and was buried near the mission he had established at Tautira Bay. Lt Tomas Gayangos took over command and set sail for Peru on 27 January, leaving the Fathers Geronimo Clota and Narciso Gonzalez and the sailors Maximo Rodriguez and Francisco Perez in charge of the mission. On the third &quot;Aguila&quot; expedition, under Don Cayetano de Langara, the mission on Tahiti was abandoned on 12 November 1775, when the Fathers successfully begged to be taken back to Lima.

During his final visit in 1777 Cook first moored in Vaitepiha Bay. From there he reunited with many Tahitian clans and established British presence on the remains of the Spanish mission. On 29 September 1777 Cook sailed for Papetoai Bay on Moorea.

=== British influence and the rise of the Pōmare ===

==== Mutineers of the &quot;Bounty&quot; ====


On 26 October 1788, , under the command of Captain William Bligh, landed in Tahiti with the mission of carrying Tahitian breadfruit trees (Tahitian: &quot;uru&quot;) to the Caribbean. Sir Joseph Banks, the botanist from James Cook&#x27;s first expedition, had concluded that this plant would be ideal to feed the African slaves working in the Caribbean plantations at very little cost. The crew remained in Tahiti for about five months, the time needed to transplant the seedlings of the trees. Three weeks after leaving Tahiti, on 28 April 1789, the crew mutinied on the initiative of Fletcher Christian. The mutineers seized the ship and set the captain and most of those members of the crew who remained loyal to him adrift in a ship&#x27;s boat. A group of mutineers then went back to settle in Tahiti, after which the Bounty, under Christian, sailed to Pitcairn Island.

Although various explorers had refused to get involved in tribal conflicts, the mutineers from the &quot;Bounty&quot; offered their services as mercenaries and furnished arms to the family which became the Pōmare Dynasty. The chief Tū knew how to use their presence in the harbours favoured by sailors to his advantage. As a result of his alliance with the mutineers, he succeeded in considerably increasing his supremacy over the island of Tahiti.

In about 1790, the ambitious chief Tū took the title of king and gave himself the name &quot;Pōmare&quot;. Captain Bligh explains that this name was a homage to his eldest daughter Teriinavahoroa, who had died of tuberculosis, &quot;an illness that made her cough (&quot;mare&quot;) a lot, especially at night (&quot;pō&quot;)&quot;. Thus he became Pōmare I, founding the Pōmare Dynasty and his lineage would be the first to unify Tahiti from 1788 to 1791. He and his descendants founded and expanded Tahitian influence to all of the lands that now constitute modern French Polynesia.

In 1791, under Captain Edward Edwards called at Tahiti and took custody of fourteen of the mutineers. Four were drowned in the sinking of &quot;Pandora&quot; on her homeward voyage, three were hanged, four were acquitted, and three were pardoned.

==== Landings of the whalers ====

In the 1790s, whalers began landing at Tahiti during their hunting expeditions in the southern hemisphere. The arrival of these whalers, who were subsequently joined by merchants coming from the penal colonies in Australia, marked the first major overturning of traditional Tahitian society. The crews introduced alcohol, arms and infectious diseases to the island, and encouraged prostitution, which brought with it venereal disease. These commercial interactions with westerners had catastrophic consequences for the Tahitian population, which shrank rapidly, ravaged by diseases and other cultural factors. During the first decade of the 19th century, the Tahitian population dropped from 16,000 to 8,000–9,000; the French census in 1854 counted a population just under 6,000.

==== Arrival of the missionaries ====

On 5 March 1797, representatives of the London Missionary Society landed at Matavai Bay (Mahina) on board &quot;Duff&quot;, with the intention of converting the pagan native populations to Christianity. The arrival of these missionaries marked a new turning point for the island of Tahiti, having a lasting impact on the local culture.

The first years proved hard work for the missionaries, despite their association with the Pōmare, the importance of whom they were aware of thanks to the reports of earlier sailors. In 1803, upon the death of Pōmare I, his son Vairaatoa succeeded him and took the title of Pōmare II. He allied himself more and more with the missionaries, and from 1803 they taught him reading and the Gospels. Furthermore, the missionaries encouraged his wish to conquer his opponents, so that they would only have to deal with a single political contact, enabling them to develop Christianity in a unified country. The conversion of Pōmare II to Protestantism in 1812 marks moreover the point when Protestantism truly took off on the island.

In about 1810, Pōmare II married Teremoemoe daughter of the chief of Raiatea, to ally himself with the chiefdoms of the Leeward Islands. On 12 November 1815, thanks to these alliances, Pōmare II won a decisive battle at Fei Pī (Punaauia), notably against Opuhara, the chief of the powerful clan of Teva. This victory allowed Pōmare II to be styled &quot;Arii Rahi&quot;, or the king of Tahiti. It was the first time that Tahiti had been united under the control of a single family. This marked the end of Tahitian feudalism and the military aristocracy, which were replaced by an absolute monarchy. At the same time, Protestantism quickly spread, thanks to the support of Pōmare II, and replaced the traditional beliefs. In 1816 the London Missionary Society sent John Williams as a missionary and teacher, and starting in 1817, the Gospels were translated into Tahitian (&quot;Reo Maohi&quot;) and taught in the religious schools. In 1818, the minister William Pascoe Crook founded the city of Papeete, which became the capital of the island.

In 1819, Pōmare II, encouraged by the missionaries, introduced the first Tahitian legal code, known under the name of the Pōmare Legal Code, which consists of nineteen laws. The missionaries and Pōmare II thus imposed a ban on nudity (obliging them to wear clothes covering their whole body), banned dances and chants (described as immodest), tattoos, and costumes made of flowers.

In the 1820s, the entire population of Tahiti converted to Protestantism. Duperrey, who berthed in Tahiti in May 1823, attests to the change in Tahitian society in a letter dated 15 May 1823: &quot;The missionaries of the Royal Society of London have totally changed the morals and customs of the inhabitants. Idolatry no longer exists among them, and they generally profess the Christian religion. The women no longer come aboard the vessel, and even when we meet them on land they are extremely reserved. (...) The bloody wars that these people used to carry out and human sacrifices have no longer taken place since 1816.&quot;

When, on 7 December 1821, Pōmare II died, his son Pōmare III was only eighteen months old. His uncle and the religious people therefore supported the regency, until 2 May 1824, the date on which the missionaries conducted his coronation, a ceremony unprecedented in Tahiti. Taking advantage of the weakness of the Pōmare, local chiefs won back some of their power and took the hereditary title of &quot;Tavana&quot; (from the English word &quot;governor&quot;). The missionaries also took advantage of the situation to change the way in which powers were arranged, and to make the Tahitian monarchy closer to the English model of a constitutional monarchy. They therefore created the Tahitian Legislative Assembly, which first sat on 23 February 1824.

In 1827, the young Pōmare III suddenly died, and it was his half-sister, Aimata, aged thirteen, who took the title of Pōmare IV. The Birmingham-born missionary George Pritchard, who was the acting British consul, became her main adviser and tried to interest her in the affairs of the kingdom but the authority of the Queen, who was certainly less charismatic than her father, was challenged by the chiefs, who had won back an important part of their prerogatives since the death of Pōmare II. The power of the Pōmare had become more symbolic than real; time and time again Queen Pōmare, Protestant and anglophile, sought in vain the protection of England.

In November 1835 Charles Darwin visited Tahiti aboard HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; on her circumnavigation, captained by Robert FitzRoy. He was impressed by what he perceived to be the positive influence the missionaries had had on the sobriety and moral character of the population. Darwin praised the scenery, but was not flattering towards Tahiti&#x27;s Queen Pōmare IV. Captain Fitzroy negotiated payment of compensation for an attack on an English ship by Tahitians, which had taken place in 1833.

In Sept. 1839, the island was visited by the United States Exploring Expedition. One of its members, Alfred Thomas Agate, produced a number of sketches of Tahitian life, some of which were later published in the United States.

=== French protectorate and the end of the Pōmare kingdom ===

In 1836, the Queen&#x27;s advisor Pritchard had two French Catholic priests expelled, François Caret and Honoré Laval. As a result, in 1838 France sent Admiral Abel Aubert du Petit-Thouars to obtain reparations. Once his mission had been completed, Admiral Du Petit-Thouars sailed towards the Marquesas Islands, which he annexed in 1842. Also in 1842, a European crisis involving Morocco escalated between France and Great Britain, souring their relations. In August 1842, Admiral Du Petit-Thouars returned and landed in Tahiti. He then made friends with Tahitian chiefs who were hostile to the Pōmare family and favourable to a French protectorate. He had them sign a request for protection in the absence of their Queen, before then approaching her and obliging her to ratify the terms of the treaty of protectorate. The treaty had not even been ratified by France itself when Jacques-Antoine Moerenhout was named royal commissaire alongside Queen Pōmare.

Within the framework of this treaty, France recognised the sovereignty of the Tahitian state. The Queen was responsible for internal affairs, while France would deal with foreign relations and assure the defence of Tahiti, as well as maintain order on the island. Once the treaty had been signed there began a struggle for influence between the English Protestants and the Catholic representatives of France. During the first years of the Protectorate, the Protestants managed to retain a considerable hold over Tahitian society, thanks to their knowledge of the country and its language. George Pritchard had been away at the time. He returned however to work towards indoctrinating the locals against the Roman Catholic French.

=== Tahitian War of independence (1844–47) ===

In 1843, the Queen&#x27;s Protestant advisor, Pritchard, persuaded her to display the Tahitian flag in place of the flag of the Protectorate. By way of reprisal, Admiral Dupetit-Thouars announced the annexation of the Kingdom of Pōmare on 6 November 1843 and set up the governor Armand Joseph Bruat there as the chief of the new colony. He threw Pritchard into prison, and later sent him back to Britain. The annexation caused the Queen to be exiled to the Leeward Islands, and after a period of troubles, a real Franco-Tahitian war began in March 1844. News of Tahiti reached Europe in early 1844. The French François Guizot, supported by King Louis-Philippe of France, had denounced annexation of the island.

The war ended in December 1846 in favour of the French. The Queen returned from exile in 1847 and agreed to sign a new covenant, considerably reducing her powers, while increasing those of the commissaire. Thus, the French reigned over the Kingdom of Tahiti. In 1863, they put an end to the British influence and replaced the British Protestant Missions with the Société des missions évangéliques de Paris (Society of Evangelical Missions of Paris).

=== Later 19th century ===

During the same period about a thousand Chinese, mainly Cantonese, were recruited at the request of a plantation owner in Tahiti, William Stewart, to work on the great cotton plantation at Atimaono. When the enterprise resulted in bankruptcy in 1873, some Chinese workers returned to their country, but a large number stayed in Tahiti and mixed with the population.

In 1866 the district councils were formed, elected, which were given the powers of the traditional hereditary chiefs. In the context of the republican assimilation, these councils tried their best to protect the traditional way of life of the local people, which was threatened by European influence.

In 1877, Queen Pōmare died after ruling for fifty years. Her son, Pōmare V, then succeeded her on the throne. The new king seemed little concerned with the affairs of the kingdom, and when in 1880 the governor Henri Isidore Chessé, supported by the Tahitian chiefs, pushed him to abdicate in favour of France, he accepted. On 29 June 1880, he ceded Tahiti to France along with the islands that were its dependencies. He was given the titular position of Officer of the Orders of the Legion of Honour and Agricultural Merit of France. Having become a colony, Tahiti thus lost all sovereignty. Tahiti was nevertheless a special colony, since all the subjects of the Kingdom of Pōmare would be given French citizenship. On 14 July 1881, among cries of &quot;Vive la République!&quot; the crowds celebrated the fact that Polynesia now belonged to France; this was the first celebration of the Tiurai (national and popular festival). In 1890, Papeete became a commune of the Republic of France.

The French painter Paul Gauguin lived on Tahiti in the 1890s and painted many Tahitian subjects. Papeari has a small Gauguin museum.

In 1891 Matthew Turner, an American shipbuilder from San Francisco who had been seeking a fast passage between the city and Tahiti, built , a two-masted schooner that made the trip in seventeen days.

=== Twentieth century to present ===

In 1903, the Établissements Français d&#x27;Océanie (French Establishments in Oceania) were created, which collected together Tahiti, the other Society Islands, the Austral Islands, the Marquesas Islands and the Tuamotu Archipelago.
During the First World War, the Papeete region of the island was attacked by two German warships. A French gunboat as well as a captured German freighter were sunk in the harbour and the two German armoured cruisers bombarded the colony. 

Between 1966 and 1996 the French Government conducted 193 nuclear bomb tests above and below the atolls of Moruroa and Fangataufa. The last test was conducted on 27 January 1996.

In 1946, Tahiti and the whole of French Polynesia became an overseas territory (&quot;Territoire d&#x27;outre-mer&quot;). Tahitians were granted French citizenship, a right that had been campaigned for by nationalist leader Pouvanaa a Oopa for many years. 

Faaʻa International Airport was opened on Tahiti in 1960.

On 17 July 1974, the French did a nuclear test over Mururoa Atoll, codenamed , but the atomic cloud and fallout did not take the direction planned. 42 hours later, the cloud reached Tahiti and the surrounding islands. As many as 111,000 people were affected. Reports showed that some people on Tahiti were exposed to 500 times the maximum allowed level for plutonium. 

In 2003, French Polynesia&#x27;s status was changed to that of an overseas collectivity (&quot;collectivité d&#x27;outre-mer&quot;), and in 2004 it was declared an overseas country (&quot;pays d&#x27;outre-mer&quot; or &quot;POM&quot;).

In 2009, Tauatomo Mairau claimed the Tahitian throne and attempted to re-assert the status of the monarchy in court.

== Politics ==


Tahiti is part of French Polynesia. French Polynesia is a semi-autonomous territory of France with its own assembly, president, budget and laws. France&#x27;s influence is limited to subsidies, education, and security.

Tahitians are French citizens with complete civil and political rights. French is the official language, but Tahitian and French are both in use. However there was a time during the 1960s and 1970s when children were forbidden to speak Tahitian in schools. Tahitian is now taught in schools; it is sometimes even a requirement for employment.

During a press conference on 26 June 2006 during the second France-Oceania Summit, French President Jacques Chirac said he did not think the majority of Tahitians wanted independence. He would keep an open door to a possible referendum in the future.

Elections for the Assembly of French Polynesia, the Territorial Assembly of French Polynesia, were held on 23 May 2004.

In a surprise result, Oscar Temaru&#x27;s pro-independence progressive coalition, Union for Democracy, formed a government with a one-seat majority in the 57-seat parliament, defeating the conservative party, Tāhōeraa Huiraatira, led by Gaston Flosse. On 8 October 2004, Flosse succeeded in passing a censure motion against the government, provoking a crisis. Flosse was removed from office in 2004 but was subsequently re-elected in 2008 after a period of political instability. His main rival Oscar Temaru served as the President of French Polynesia during multiple terms: 2004-2005, 2006-2008, and 2009-2013. He led the left-wing pro-independence party, Union for Democracy (UPLD). Temaru focused on greater autonomy for French Polynesia and calls for independence.

== Demographics ==
The indigenous Tahitians are of Polynesian ancestry and make up 70% of the population alongside Europeans, East Asians (mostly Chinese), and people of mixed heritage, sometimes referred to as &quot;Demis&quot;.
The places of birth of the 189,517 residents of the island of Tahiti at the 2017 census were the following:
*75.4% were born in Tahiti (up from 71.5% at the 2007 census)
*9.3% in Metropolitan France (down from 10.9% in 2007)
*5.9% elsewhere in the Society Islands (down from 6.4% in 2007)
*2.8% in the Tuamotu-Gambier (down from 3.3% in 2007)
*1.8% in the Marquesas Islands (down from 2.0% in 2007)
*1.6% in the Austral Islands (down from 2.0% in 2007)
*1.3% in the overseas departments and territories of France other than French Polynesia (1.0% in New Caledonia and Wallis and Futuna; 0.3% in the other overseas departments and collectivities) (down from 1.6% in 2007)
*0.5% in East and Southeast Asia (same percentage as in 2007)
*0.3% in North Africa (most of them Pieds-Noirs) (down from 0.4% in 2007)
*1.1% in other foreign countries (down from 1.5% in 2007)

Most people from metropolitan France live in Papeete and its suburbs, notably Punaauia, where they made up 16.8% of the population at the 2017 census, and Arue, where they made up 15.9%; these percentages do not include their children born in French Polynesia.

=== Historical population ===

== Administrative divisions ==
The island consists of 12 communes, which, along with Moorea-Maiao, make up the Windward Islands administrative subdivision.

The capital is Papeetē and the largest commune by population is Faaā while Taiarapu-Est has the largest area.

=== Communes of Tahiti ===
The following is a list of communes and their subdivisions sorted alphabetically:
== Economy ==
Tourism is a significant industry, generating 17% of GDP before the COVID-19 pandemic.

The main trading partners are Metropolitan France for about 40% of imports and about 25% of exports. The other main trading partners are China, the US, South Korea, and New Zealand.

Tahitian pearl (Black pearl) farming is also a substantial source of revenues, most of the pearls being exported to Japan, Europe and the United States. Tahiti also exports vanilla, fruits, flowers, monoi, fish, copra oil, and noni. Tahiti is also home to a single winery, whose vineyards are located on the Rangiroa atoll.

Unemployment affects about 15% of the active population, especially women and unqualified young people.

Tahiti&#x27;s currency, the French Pacific Franc (CFP, also known as XPF), is pegged to the euro at 1 CFP=EUR .0084 (1 EUR=119.48 CFP, approx. 113 CFP to the United States dollar in November 2024). Hotels and financial institutions offer exchange services.

Sales tax in Tahiti is called &quot;Taxe sur la valeur ajoutée&quot; (TVA or value added tax (VAT) in English). VAT in 2009 was 10% on tourist services, and 6% on hotels, small boarding houses, food and beverages. VAT on the purchase of goods and products is 16%.

=== Energy and electricity ===
French Polynesia imports its petroleum and has no local refinery or production capabilities. Daily consumption of imported oil products was 7,430 barrels in 2012 and 6,100 barrels per day in 2022, according to the US Energy Information Administration. The utility EDT operates hydroelectric plants, solar plants, and a 10 MWh battery to reduce oil demand.

== Culture ==


As is mentioned in Captain Cook&#x27;s visit, breadfruit is highly coveted as a staple crop. A main way of consume it is famously observed and documented in Joseph Banks&#x27; diaries is by storing breadfruit into a very ripe, sweetening stage before burying them in weighted and leaf-lined pits which ferment into a sour paste known as &quot;mahie&quot;.

===Art===
Tahitian cultures included an oral tradition that involved the mythology of gods, such as Oro and beliefs, as well as ancient traditions such as tattooing and navigation. The annual Heivā I Tahiti Festival in July is a celebration of traditional culture, dance, music and sports including a long-distance race between the islands of French Polynesia, in modern outrigger canoes (vaa).

The Paul Gauguin Museum is dedicated to the life and works of French artist Paul Gauguin (1848–1903) who resided in Tahiti for years and painted such works as &quot;Two Tahitian Women&quot;, &quot;Tahitian Women on the Beach&quot;, and &quot;Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?&quot;

The Musée de Tahiti et des Îles (Museum of Tahiti and the Islands) is in Punaauia. It is an ethnographic museum that was founded in 1974 to conserve and restore Polynesian artefacts and cultural practices.

The Robert Wan Pearl Museum is the world&#x27;s only museum dedicated to pearls. The Papeete Market sells local arts and crafts.

=== Dance ===


One of the most widely recognised images of the islands is the world-famous Tahitian dance. The &quot;ōtea&quot; (sometimes written as &quot;otea&quot;) is a traditional dance from Tahiti, where the dancers, standing in several rows, execute figures. This dance, easily recognised by its fast hip-shaking and grass skirts, is often confused with the Hawaiian hula, a generally slower, more graceful dance which focuses more on the hands and storytelling than the hips.

The ōtea is one of the few dances which existed in pre-European times as a male dance. On the other hand, the &quot;hura&quot; (Tahitian vernacular for &quot;hula&quot;), a dance for women, has disappeared, and the couple&#x27;s dance &quot;upaupa&quot; is likewise gone but may have re-emerged as the tamure. Nowadays, the ōtea can be danced by men (&quot;ōtea tāne&quot;), by women (&quot;ōtea vahine&quot;), or by both genders (&quot;ōtea āmui&quot;, &quot;united ō&quot;). The dance is with music only, drums, but no singing. The drum can be one of the types of the tōere, a laying log of wood with a longitudinal slit, which is struck by one or two sticks. Or it can be the &quot;pahu&quot;, the ancient Tahitian standing drum covered with a shark skin and struck by the hands or with sticks. The rhythm from the tōere is fast; from the pahu it is slower. A smaller drum, the &quot;faatete&quot;, can also be used.

The dancers make gestures, re-enacting daily occupations of life. For the men the themes can be chosen from warfare or sailing, and then they may use spears or paddles.

For women the themes are closer to home or from nature: combing their hair or the flight of a butterfly, for example. More elaborate themes can be chosen, for example, one where the dancers end up in a map of Tahiti, highlighting important places. In a proper ōtea the story of the theme should pervade the whole dance.

The group dance called Aparima is often performed with the dancers dressed in pareo and maro. There are two types of aparima: the &quot;aparima hīmene&quot; (sung handdance) and the &quot;aparima vāvā&quot; (silent handdance), the latter being performed with music only and no singing.

Newer dances include the hivinau and the pāʻōʻā.

=== Death ===
The Tahitians believed in the afterlife, a paradise called Rohutu-noanoa. When a Tahitian died, the corpse was wrapped in barkcloth and placed on a funeral bier, &quot;fare tupapa u&quot;, which was a raised canoe awning on posts surrounded by bamboo. Food for the gods was placed nearby to prevent them from eating the body, which would condemn the spirit to the underworld. Mourners would slash themselves with shark&#x27;s teeth and smear the blood on barkcloth placed nearby. Most importantly, the Chief Mourner donned the &quot;parae&quot;, an elaborate costume that included an iridescent mask made of four polished pearl shell discs. One disk was black, signifying Po, the spirit world, while one was white, signifying Ao, the world of people. A crown of red feathers signified Oro. A curved wooden board, &quot;pautu&quot;, below the mask contained five polished pearl shells, which signified Hina, the moon goddess. Hanging below were more shells in rows, &quot;ahu-parau&quot;, representing the Pleiades, believed to be the eyes of former chiefs. Finally, a ceremonial garment, &quot;tiputa&quot;, covered the body and was decorated with an apron of polished coconut shells, &quot;ahu-aipu&quot;.

=== Sport ===

The Tahitian national sport is Vaa. In English, this paddle sport is also known as outrigger canoe. The Tahitians consistently achieve record-breaking and top times as world champions in this sport.

Major sports in Tahiti include rugby union and association football and the island has fielded a national basketball team, which is a member of FIBA Oceania.

Another sport is surfing, with famous surfers such as Malik Joyeux and Michel Bourez. Teahupoo is one of the deadliest surf breaks in the world.

Rugby union in Tahiti is governed by the Fédération Tahitienne de Rugby de Polynésie Française which was formed in 1989. The Tahiti national rugby union team has been active since 1971 but have only played 12 games since then.

Football in Tahiti is administered by the Fédération Tahitienne de Football and was founded in 1938. The Tahiti Division Fédérale is the top division on the island and the Tahiti Championnat Enterprise is the second tier. Some of the major clubs are AS Manu-Ura, who play in Stade Hamuta, AS Pirae, who play in the Stade Pater Te Hono Nui and AS Tefana, who play in the Stade Louis Ganivet. Lesser clubs include Matavai. In 2012, the national team won the OFC Nations Cup qualifying for the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup in Brazil and becoming the first team other than Australia or New Zealand to win it.

The Tahiti Cup is the islands&#x27; premier football knockout tournament and has been played for since 1938. The winner of the Tahiti Cup goes on to play the winner of the Tahiti Division Fédérale in the Tahiti Coupe des Champions.

In 2010, Tahiti was chosen as the host of the 2013 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup, which was held in September 2013. The national team reached the semifinals. They achieved even more success in subsequent editions, the 2015 and 2017, where they reached the final on both occasions.

Tahiti has also been represented at the World Championship of Pétanque. They are the pre-eminent country in the Oceania region for Pétanque, undoubtedly due to their strong connections to France.

As part of the 2024 Summer Olympics, Tahiti hosted the surfing competition. It was the only sport to be held outside of metropolitan France, as Paris, located away, hosts the international competition. 
The Men&#x27;s Shortboard gold medal was won by Tahitian Kauli Vaast. 

=== Film ===
Tahiti is depicted in the biography of Paul Gauguin in the 2017 French film &quot;Gauguin: Voyage to Tahiti&quot; portraying his life during his years on Tahiti.

Also linked to Tahiti are the various films narrating the story of the 1789 mutiny on HMS &quot;Bounty&quot; – e.g. &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1962) with actor Marlon Brando, &quot;The Bounty&quot; (1984) with Mel Gibson.

A more recent movie is the 2022 thriller film, &quot;Pacifiction&quot;, related to French nuclear testing in the area.

== Education ==
Tahiti is home to the University of French Polynesia (Université de la Polynésie Française). It is a growing university, with 3,200 students and 62 researchers. Courses are available in topics such as law, commerce, science, and literature. There are also high schools, including the Catholic Collège La Mennais located in Papeete.

== Notable people ==

* Farahia Teuiria (born 1972), footballer

* Kauli Vaast (born 2002), Olympic Surfer

== Transport ==

=== Air ===

Faaā International Airport is located from Papeete in the commune of Faaā and is the only international airport in French Polynesia. Because of limited level terrain, rather than levelling large stretches of sloping agricultural land, the airport is built primarily on reclaimed land on the coral reef just off-shore.

International destinations such as Auckland, Honolulu, Los Angeles, Paris, San Francisco, Sydney and Tokyo are served by Air France, Air New Zealand, Air Tahiti Nui French Polynesia&#x27;s flag carrier, Hawaiian Airlines, United Airlines, and French Bee.

Flights within French Polynesia and to New Caledonia are available from Aircalin and Air Tahiti; Air Tahiti has their headquarters at the airport.

=== Ferry ===

The Moorea Ferry operates from Papeete and takes about 45 minutes to travel to Moorea. Other ferries are the Aremiti 5 and the Aremiti 7 and these two ferries sail to Moorea in about half an hour. There are also several ferries that transport people and goods throughout the islands. The Bora Bora cruiseline sails to Bora Bora about once a week. The main hub for these ferries is the Papeete Wharf.

=== Roads ===

Tahiti has a freeway that runs across the west coast. This freeway starts in Arue and continues across the Papeete urban area. Then it continues along the west coast of Tahiti Nui through smaller villages. The freeway turns east toward Taravao where Tahiti Nui meets Tahiti Iti. Tahiti&#x27;s west coast freeway keeps going until Teahupoo where the freeway becomes a thin paved road.

<text>The 26th century BC was a century that lasted from the year 2600 BC to 2501
BC.

==Events==
===Crete===
* c. 2600–2400 BC: Early Minoan I period in Crete.

===Egypt===
* c. 2551–2526 BC: Reign of Khufu, second pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty. The height of the Old Kingdom under the reigns of Khufu, Khafre and Menkaure. Khufu leads an expedition in Sinai and has the Great Pyramid of Giza built. During his reign, the solar cult of Ra prevails, as evidenced by the Khufu ship. His successor, Djedefre, is the first pharaoh to refer to himself by the epithet &quot;Son of Ra&quot;. The pharaoh&#x27;s divine filiation asserts itself in the second part of the Fourth Dynasty: the royal title is definitively fixed with the appearance of a fifth royal name preceded by the title &quot;Son of Ra&quot;.
* c. 2520–2493 BC: Reign of Khafre. the Pyramid of Khafre is built, along with the Great Sphinx of Giza, a monumental sculpture of a pharaoh (either Khafre or Khufu) with a lion&#x27;s body.
* Reigns of Menkaure and Shepseskaf

===Mesopotamia===
* c. 2600–2334 BC: Early Dynastic period III. Dominion of the First Dynasty of Ur. The Royal Cemetery at Ur is constructed.
* c. 2600 BC: Reign of Akalamdug, king of Ur.
* c. 2600–2500 BC: The Instructions of Shuruppak, the earliest known literary texts, are created in Adab, Shuruppak and Abu Salabikh.
* 2570 BC: Reigns of Uhub, king of Kish, and of En-hegal, king of Lagash.
* 2560–2525 BC: Reign of Mesannepada, king of Ur. The city, which had only 4,000 citizens at the time, would become a large capital during the 40 years of Mesannepada&#x27;s reign. Its opulence was brought about by its commercial activity: Ur&#x27;s southern river port concentrated Mesopotamian trade with clients along the Persian Gulf shores.
* 2550 BC: Reign of Mesilim, king of Kish. He was an apparent suzerain over the Lagash king Luga-shag-engur and the Adab king Nin-kisalsi. A conflict between Lagash and the neighboring Umma begins over fields claimed by each of the parties. An initial crisis is settled by Mesilim in favor of Lagash.
* 2540 BC: Mesannepada, who has already dominated the city of Nippur, takes advantage of an eclipse of power in Kish (caused by an incursion by the Elamites of Awan) to seize the city. He becomes the ruler of all of Lower Mesopotamia as he becomes the king of Kish, and his name appears on a pearl in Mari.
* 2525–2485 BC: Reign of A&#x27;annepada, king of Ur.

<doc id="65169" wikidata="Q606830" url="?curid=65169" title="Antony and Cleopatra">
<text>Antony and Cleopatra is a tragedy by William Shakespeare. The play was first performed around 1607, by the King&#x27;s Men at either the Blackfriars Theatre or the Globe Theatre. Its first appearance in print was in the First Folio published in 1623, under the title The Tragedie of Anthonie, and Cleopatra.

The plot is based on Thomas North&#x27;s 1579 English translation of Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot; (in Ancient Greek) and follows the relationship between Cleopatra and Mark Antony from the time of the Sicilian revolt to Cleopatra&#x27;s suicide during the War of Actium. The main antagonist is Octavius Caesar, one of Antony&#x27;s fellow triumvirs of the Second Triumvirate and the first emperor of the Roman Empire. The tragedy is mainly set in the Roman Republic and Ptolemaic Egypt and is characterized by swift shifts in geographical location and linguistic register as it alternates between sensual, imaginative Alexandria and a more pragmatic, austere Rome.

Many consider Shakespeare&#x27;s Cleopatra, whom Enobarbus describes as having &quot;infinite variety&quot;, as one of the most complex and fully developed female characters in the playwright&#x27;s body of work. She is frequently vain and histrionic enough to provoke an audience almost to scorn; at the same time, Shakespeare invests her and Antony with tragic grandeur. These contradictory features have led to famously divided critical responses. It is difficult to classify &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; as belonging to a single genre. It can be described as a history play (though it does not completely adhere to historical accounts), as a tragedy, as a comedy, as a romance, and according to some critics, such as McCarter, a problem play. All that can be said with certainty is that it is a Roman play. It is perhaps a sequel to another of Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedies, &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;.

== Synopsis ==
Mark Antony—one of the triumvirs of the Roman Republic, along with Octavius and Lepidus—has neglected his soldierly duties after being beguiled by Egypt&#x27;s Queen, Cleopatra. He ignores Rome&#x27;s domestic problems, including the fact that his third wife Fulvia rebelled against Octavius and then died.

Octavius calls Antony back to Rome from Alexandria to help him fight against Sextus Pompey, Menecrates, and Menas, three notorious pirates of the Mediterranean. At Alexandria, Cleopatra begs Antony not to go, and though he repeatedly affirms his deep passionate love for her, he eventually leaves.

The triumvirs meet in Rome, where Antony and Octavius put to rest, for now, their disagreements. Octavius&#x27; general, Agrippa, suggests that Antony should marry Octavius&#x27;s sister, Octavia, in order to cement the friendly bond between the two men. Antony accepts. Antony&#x27;s lieutenant Enobarbus, though, knows that Octavia can never satisfy him after Cleopatra. In a famous passage, he describes Cleopatra&#x27;s charms: &quot;Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale / Her infinite variety: other women cloy / The appetites they feed, but she makes hungry / Where most she satisfies.&quot;

A soothsayer warns Antony that he is sure to lose if he ever tries to fight Octavius.

In Egypt, Cleopatra learns of Antony&#x27;s marriage to Octavia and takes furious revenge upon the messenger who brings her the news. She grows content only when her courtiers assure her that Octavia is homely: short, low-browed, round-faced and with bad hair.

Before battle, the triumvirs parley with Sextus Pompey, and offer him a truce. He can retain Sicily and Sardinia, but he must help them &quot;rid the sea of pirates&quot; and send them tributes. After some hesitation, Sextus agrees. They engage in a drunken celebration on Sextus&#x27; galley, though the austere Octavius leaves early and sober from the party. Menas suggests to Sextus that he kill the three triumvirs and make himself ruler of the Roman Republic, but he refuses, finding it dishonourable. After Antony departs Rome for Athens, Octavius and Lepidus break their truce with Sextus and war against him. This is unapproved by Antony, and he is furious.

Antony returns to Hellenistic Alexandria and crowns Cleopatra and himself as rulers of Egypt and the eastern third of the Roman Republic (which was Antony&#x27;s share as one of the triumvirs). He accuses Octavius of not giving him his fair share of Sextus&#x27; lands, and is angry that Lepidus, whom Octavius has imprisoned, is out of the triumvirate. Octavius agrees to the former demand, but otherwise is very displeased with what Antony has done.

Antony prepares to battle Octavius. Enobarbus urges Antony to fight on land, where he has the advantage, instead of by sea, where the navy of Octavius is lighter, more mobile and better manned. Antony refuses, since Octavius has dared him to fight at sea. Cleopatra pledges her fleet to aid Antony. However, during the Battle of Actium off the western coast of Greece, Cleopatra flees with her sixty ships, and Antony follows her, leaving his forces to ruin. Ashamed of what he has done for the love of Cleopatra, Antony reproaches her for making him a coward, but also sets this true and deep love above all else, saying &quot;Give me a kiss; even this repays me.&quot;

Octavius sends a messenger to ask Cleopatra to give up Antony and come over to his side. She hesitates, and flirts with the messenger, when Antony walks in and angrily denounces her behavior. He sends the messenger to be whipped. Eventually, he forgives Cleopatra and pledges to fight another battle for her, this time on land.

On the eve of the battle, Antony&#x27;s soldiers hear strange portents, which they interpret as the god Hercules abandoning his protection of Antony. Furthermore, Enobarbus, Antony&#x27;s long-serving lieutenant, deserts him and goes over to Octavius&#x27; side. Rather than confiscating Enobarbus&#x27; goods, which Enobarbus did not take with him when he fled, Antony orders them to be sent to Enobarbus. Enobarbus is so overwhelmed by Antony&#x27;s generosity, and so ashamed of his own disloyalty, that he dies from a broken heart.

Antony loses the battle as his troops desert en masse and he denounces Cleopatra: &quot;This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me.&quot; He resolves to kill her for the imagined treachery. Cleopatra decides that the only way to win back Antony&#x27;s love is to send him word that she killed herself, dying with his name on her lips. She locks herself in her monument, and awaits Antony&#x27;s return.

Her plan backfires: rather than rushing back in remorse to see the &quot;dead&quot; Cleopatra, Antony decides that his own life is no longer worth living. He begs one of his aides, Eros, to run him through with a sword, but Eros cannot bear to do it and kills himself. Antony admires Eros&#x27; courage and attempts to do the same, but only succeeds in wounding himself. In great pain, he learns that Cleopatra is indeed alive. He is hoisted up to her in her monument and dies in her arms.

Since Egypt has been defeated, the captive Cleopatra is placed under a guard of Roman soldiers. She tries to take her own life with a dagger, but Proculeius disarms her. Octavius arrives, assuring her she will be treated with honour and dignity. But Dolabella secretly warns her that Octavius intends to parade her at his Roman triumph. Cleopatra bitterly envisions the endless humiliations awaiting her for the rest of her life as a Roman conquest.

Cleopatra kills herself using the venomous bite of an asp, imagining how she will meet Antony again in the afterlife. Her serving maids Iras and Charmian also die, Iras from heartbreak and Charmian from one of the two asps in Cleopatra&#x27;s basket. Octavius discovers the dead bodies and experiences conflicting emotions. Antony and Cleopatra&#x27;s deaths leave him free to become the first Roman Emperor, but he also feels some sympathy for them. He orders a public military funeral.

== Sources ==

The principal source for the story is an English translation of a French translation of Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Mark Antony&quot;, from the &quot;Lives of the Noble Grecians and Romans Compared Together&quot;. This translation, by Sir Thomas North, was first published in 1579. Many phrases in Shakespeare&#x27;s play are taken directly from North, including Enobarbus&#x27; famous description of Cleopatra and her barge:&lt;poem&gt;
I will tell you.
The barge she sat in, like a burnish&#x27;d throne,
Burn&#x27;d on the water: the poop was beaten gold;
Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,
Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
The water which they beat to follow faster,
As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
It beggar&#x27;d all description: she did lie
In her pavilion—cloth-of-gold of tissue—
O&#x27;er-picturing that Venus where we see
The fancy outwork nature: on each side her
Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
With divers-colour&#x27;d fans, whose wind did seem
To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
And what they undid did.
&lt;/poem&gt;This may be compared with North&#x27;s text:

However, Shakespeare also adds scenes, including many portraying Cleopatra&#x27;s domestic life, and the role of Enobarbus is greatly developed. Historical facts are also changed: in Plutarch, Antony&#x27;s final defeat was many weeks after the Battle of Actium, and Octavia lived with Antony for several years and bore him two children: Antonia Major, paternal grandmother of the Emperor Nero and maternal grandmother of the Empress Valeria Messalina, and Antonia Minor, the sister-in-law of the Emperor Tiberius, mother of the Emperor Claudius, and paternal grandmother of the Emperor Caligula and Empress Agrippina the Younger.

== Date and text ==

Many scholars believe Shakespeare&#x27;s play was written in 1606–07, although some researchers have argued for an earlier dating, around 1603–04. &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; was entered in the Stationers&#x27; Register (an early form of copyright for printed works) in May 1608, but it does not seem to have been actually printed until the publication of the First Folio in 1623. The Folio is therefore the only authoritative text today. Some scholars speculate that it derives from Shakespeare&#x27;s own draft, or &quot;foul papers&quot;, since it contains minor errors in speech labels and stage directions that are thought to be characteristic of the author in the process of composition.

Modern editions divide the play into a conventional five-act structure but, as in most of his earlier plays, Shakespeare did not create these act divisions. His play is articulated in forty separate &quot;scenes&quot;, more than he used for any other play. Even the word &quot;scenes&quot; may be inappropriate as a description, as the scene changes are often very fluid, almost montage-like. The large number of scenes is necessary because the action frequently switches between Alexandria, Italy, Messina in Sicily, Syria, Athens, and other parts of Egypt and the Roman Republic. The play contains thirty-four speaking characters, fairly typical for a Shakespeare play on such an epic scale.

== Analysis and criticism ==

=== Classical allusions and analogues: Dido and Aeneas from Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;===

Many critics have noted the strong influence of Virgil&#x27;s first-century Roman epic poem, the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, on Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;. Such influence should be expected, given the prevalence of allusions to Virgil in the Renaissance culture in which Shakespeare was educated. The historical Antony and Cleopatra were the prototypes and antitypes for Virgil&#x27;s Dido and Aeneas: Dido, ruler of the north African city of Carthage, tempts Aeneas, the legendary exemplar of Roman &quot;pietas&quot;, to forego his task of founding Rome after the fall of Troy. The fictional Aeneas dutifully resists Dido&#x27;s temptation and abandons her to forge on to Italy, placing political destiny before romantic love, in stark contrast to Antony, who puts passionate love of his own Egyptian queen, Cleopatra, before duty to Rome. Given the well-established traditional connections between the fictional Dido and Aeneas and the historical Antony and Cleopatra, it is no surprise that Shakespeare includes numerous allusions to Virgil&#x27;s epic in his historical tragedy. As Janet Adelman observes, &quot;almost all the central elements in &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; are to be found in the &quot;Aeneid&quot;: the opposing values of Rome and a foreign passion; the political necessity of a passionless Roman marriage; the concept of an afterlife in which the passionate lovers meet.&quot; However, as Heather James argues, Shakespeare&#x27;s allusions to Virgil&#x27;s Dido and Aeneas are far from slavish imitations. James emphasizes the various ways in which Shakespeare&#x27;s play subverts the ideology of the Virgilian tradition; one such instance of this subversion is Cleopatra&#x27;s dream of Antony in Act 5 (&quot;I dreamt there was an Emperor Antony&quot; [5.2.75]). James argues that in her extended description of this dream, Cleopatra &quot;reconstructs the heroic masculinity of an Antony whose identity has been fragmented and scattered by Roman opinion.&quot; This politically charged dream vision is just one example of the way that Shakespeare&#x27;s story destabilises and potentially critiques the Roman ideology inherited from Virgil&#x27;s epic and embodied in the mythic Roman ancestor Aeneas.

=== Critical history: changing views of Cleopatra ===

Cleopatra, being the complex figure that she is, has faced a variety of interpretations of character throughout history. Perhaps the most famous dichotomy is that of the manipulative seductress versus the skilled leader. Examining the critical history of the character of Cleopatra reveals that intellectuals of the 19th century and the early 20th century viewed her as merely an object of sexuality that could be understood and diminished rather than an imposing force with great poise and capacity for leadership.

This phenomenon is illustrated by the famous poet T. S. Eliot&#x27;s take on Cleopatra. He saw her as &quot;no wielder of power&quot;, but rather that her &quot;devouring sexuality...diminishes her power&quot;. His language and writings use images of darkness, desire, beauty, sensuality, and carnality to portray not a strong, powerful woman, but a temptress. Throughout his writing on Antony and Cleopatra, Eliot refers to Cleopatra as material rather than person. He frequently calls her &quot;thing&quot;. Eliot conveys the view of early critical history on the character of Cleopatra.

Other scholars also discuss early critics&#x27; views of Cleopatra in relation to a serpent signifying &quot;original sin&quot;. The symbol of the serpent &quot;functions, at the symbolic level, as a means of her submission, the phallic appropriation of the queen&#x27;s body (and the land it embodies) by Octavius and the empire&quot;. The serpent, because it represents temptation, sin, and feminine weakness, is used by 19th and early 20th century critics to undermine Cleopatra&#x27;s political authority and to emphasise the image of Cleopatra as manipulative seductress.

The postmodern view of Cleopatra is complex. Doris Adler suggests that, in a postmodern philosophical sense, we cannot begin to grasp the character of Cleopatra because, &quot;In a sense it is a distortion to consider Cleopatra at any moment apart from the entire cultural milieu that creates and consumes Antony and Cleopatra on stage. However the isolation and microscopic examination of a single aspect apart from its host environment is an effort to improve the understanding of the broader context. In similar fashion, the isolation and examination of the stage image of Cleopatra becomes an attempt to improve the understanding of the theatrical power of her infinite variety and the cultural treatment of that power.&quot; So, as a microcosm, Cleopatra can be understood within a postmodern context, as long as one understands that the purpose for the examination of this microcosm is to further one&#x27;s own interpretation of the work as a whole. Author L.T. Fitz believes that it is not possible to derive a clear, postmodern view of Cleopatra due to the sexism that all critics bring with them when they review her intricate character. She states specifically, &quot;Almost all critical approaches to this play have been coloured by the sexist assumptions the critics have brought with them to their reading.&quot; One seemingly anti-sexist viewpoint comes from Donald C. Freeman&#x27;s articulations of the meaning and significance of the deaths of both Antony and Cleopatra at the end of the play. Freeman states, &quot;We understand Antony as a grand failure because the container of his Romanness &quot;&quot;: it can no longer outline and define him even to himself. Conversely, we understand Cleopatra at her death as the transcendent queen of &quot;immortal longings&quot; because the container of her mortality can no longer restrain her: unlike Antony, she never melts, but sublimates from her very earthly flesh to ethereal fire and air.&quot;

These constant shifts in the perception of Cleopatra are well-represented in a review of Estelle Parsons&#x27; adaptation of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; at the Interart Theatre in New York City. Arthur Holmberg surmises, &quot;What had at first seemed like a desperate attempt to be chic in a trendy New York manner was, in fact, an ingenious way to characterise the differences between Antony&#x27;s Rome and Cleopatra&#x27;s Egypt. Most productions rely on rather predictable contrasts in costuming to imply the rigid discipline of the former and the languid self-indulgence of the latter. By exploiting ethnic differences in speech, gesture, and movement, Parsons rendered the clash between two opposing cultures not only contemporary but also poignant. In this setting, the white Egyptians represented a graceful and ancient aristocracy—well groomed, elegantly poised, and doomed. The Romans, upstarts from the West, lacked finesse and polish. But by sheer brute strength they would hold dominion over principalities and kingdoms.&quot; This assessment of the changing way in which Cleopatra is represented in modern adaptations of Shakespeare&#x27;s play is yet another example of how the modern and postmodern view of Cleopatra is constantly evolving.

Cleopatra is a difficult character to pin down because there are multiple aspects of her personality of which we occasionally get a glimpse. However, the most dominant parts of her character seem to oscillate between a powerful ruler, a seductress, and a heroine of sorts. Power is one of Cleopatra&#x27;s most dominant character traits and she uses it as a means of control. This thirst for control manifested itself through Cleopatra&#x27;s initial seduction of Antony in which she was dressed as Aphrodite, the goddess of love, and made quite a calculated entrance in order to capture his attention. This sexualised act extends itself into Cleopatra&#x27;s role as a seductress because it was her courage and unapologetic manner that leaves people remembering her as a &quot;grasping, licentious harlot&quot;. However, despite her &quot;insatiable sexual passion&quot; she was still using these relationships as part of a grander political scheme, once again revealing how dominant Cleopatra&#x27;s desire was for power. Due to Cleopatra&#x27;s close relationship with power, she seems to take on the role of a heroine because there is something in her passion and intelligence that intrigues others. She was an autonomous and confident ruler, sending a powerful message about the independence and strength of women. Cleopatra had quite a wide influence, and still continues to inspire, making her a heroine to many.

=== Cleopatra&#x27;s race ===
Theatrical portrayals of Cleopatra in Shakespeare and beyond have a complicated history. In the Pelican edition of &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, Professor Albert R. Braunmuller discusses how, in the play she is insulted by Philo by being called a &quot;gypsy&quot; which is a derivative of the word &quot;Egyptian&quot; but also evokes imagery of &quot;Romany people, dark-haired, dark-skinned&quot; which would be in line with a much more racialized version of Cleopatra. The other notable insult used towards Cleopatra in the play is when Philo calls her &quot;tawny&quot;. Braunmuller notes that &quot;tawny&quot; is &quot;hard to define historically&quot; but that it &quot;seems to have meant some brownish color, and Shakespeare elsewhere uses it to describe suntanned or sunburnt skin, which Elizabethan Canons of beauty regarded as undesirable.&quot;

Braunmuller contextualizes all of this by reminding modern audiences that viewers and writers during Shakespeare&#x27;s time would have had more complicated perspectives on race, ethnicity and related subjects and that their viewpoints were &quot;extremely hard to define&quot;. There were also precursors to Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; that portrayed Cleopatra as having &quot;Macedonian-Greek descent.

Pascale Aebischer&#x27;s analysis of race in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; further discusses the historically and culturally ambiguous nature of Cleopatra&#x27;s race. The paper enters into and gives context to the existing academic conversation surrounding the racial identity of Shakespeare&#x27;s Cleopatra. Aebischer reviews the historical portrayals leading up to and including Shakespeare&#x27;s portrayal of Cleopatra and uses them to analyze the opposing analyses of Cleopatra as either black or white and also to look at how race even functioned during the time period that plays like this were written. She concludes that portrayals of Cleopatra have been historically complicated and varied widely. Although, factually, she was of European ethnic origin, her racial identity on stage becomes intertwined with the cultural and social identity she is portraying in a way that makes determining her precise racial identity difficult. Aebischer points to scholars like &#x27;Linda Charnes [who] cannily observe, &quot;descriptions of Cleopatra in [Shakespeare&#x27;s] play are never more than descriptions of the effect she has on the onlooker&quot;&#x27;. Aebischer eventually concludes that &quot;we must accept that Shakespeare&#x27;s Cleopatra is neither black nor white, but that should not stop us from appreciating the political significance of casting choices, nor should it fool us into thinking that, for a character like Cleopatra, any casting choice will ever be &#x27;colourblind.&#x27;&quot; Within the context of theatrical portrayals of Cleopatra, Aebischer asserts that &quot;racial attributes are not properties that are embodied, but theatrical properties to be deployed and discarded at will.&quot;

=== Structure: Egypt and Rome ===
The relationship between Egypt and Rome in &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; is central to understanding the plot, as the dichotomy allows the reader to gain more insight into the characters, their relationships, and the ongoing events that occur throughout the play. Shakespeare emphasises the differences between the two nations with his use of language and literary devices, which also highlight the different characterisations of the two countries by their own inhabitants and visitors. Literary critics have also spent many years developing arguments concerning the &quot;masculinity&quot; of Rome and the Romans and the &quot;femininity&quot; of Egypt and the Egyptians. In traditional criticism of &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, &quot;Rome has been characterised as a male world, presided over by the austere Caesar, and Egypt as a female domain, embodied by a Cleopatra who is seen to be as abundant, leaky, and changeable as the Nile&quot;. In such a reading, male and female, Rome and Egypt, reason and emotion, and austerity and leisure are treated as mutually exclusive binaries that all interrelate with one another. The straightforwardness of the binary between male Rome and female Egypt has been challenged in later 20th-century criticism of the play: &quot;In the wake of feminist, poststructuralist, and cultural-materialist critiques of gender essentialism, most modern Shakespeare scholars are inclined to be far more skeptical about claims that Shakespeare possessed a unique insight into a timeless &#x27;femininity&#x27;.&quot; As a result, critics have been much more likely in recent years to describe Cleopatra as a character that confuses or deconstructs gender than as a character that embodies the feminine.

==== Literary devices used to convey the differences between Rome and Egypt ====

In &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, Shakespeare uses several literary techniques to convey a deeper meaning about the differences between Rome and Egypt. One example of this is his schema of the container as suggested by critic Donald Freeman in his article, &quot;The rack dislimns.&quot; In his article, Freeman suggests that the container is representative of the body and the overall theme of the play that &quot;knowing is seeing.&quot; In literary terms a schema refers to a plan throughout the work, which means that Shakespeare had a set path for unveiling the meaning of the &quot;container&quot; to the audience within the play. An example of the body in reference to the container can be seen in the following passage:

&lt;poem&gt;
Nay, but this dotage of our general&#x27;s
O&#x27;erflows the measure ...
His captain&#x27;s heart,
Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper
And is become the bellows and the fan
To cool a gypsy&#x27;s lust. (1.1.1–2, 6–10)
&lt;/poem&gt;

The lack of tolerance exerted by the hard-edged Roman military code allots to a general&#x27;s dalliance is metaphorised as a container, a measuring cup that cannot hold the liquid of Antony&#x27;s grand passion. Later we also see Antony&#x27;s heart-container swells again because it &quot;o&#x27;erflows the measure.&quot; For Antony, the container of the Rome-world is confining and a &quot;measure&quot;, while the container of the Egypt-world is liberating, an ample domain where he can explore. The contrast between the two is expressed in two of the play&#x27;s famous speeches:

&lt;poem&gt;
Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space!
Kingdoms are clay!
(1.1.34–36)
&lt;/poem&gt;

For Rome to &quot;melt is for it to lose its defining shape, the boundary that contains its civic and military codes.&quot; This schema is important in understanding Antony&#x27;s grand failure because the Roman container can no longer outline or define him—even to himself. Conversely we come to understand Cleopatra in that the container of her mortality can no longer restrain her. Unlike Antony whose container melts, she gains a sublimity being released into the air.

In her article &quot;Roman World, Egyptian Earth&quot;, critic Mary Thomas Crane introduces another symbol throughout the play: The four elements. In general, characters associated with Egypt perceive their world composed of the Aristotelian elements, which are earth, wind, fire and water. For Aristotle these physical elements were the centre of the universe and appropriately Cleopatra heralds her coming death when she proclaims, &quot;I am fire and air; my other elements/I give to baser life&quot;, (5.2.289–290). Romans, on the other hand, seem to have left behind that system, replacing it with a subjectivity separated from and overlooking the natural world and imagining itself as able to control it. These differing systems of thought and perception result in very different versions of nation and empire. Shakespeare&#x27;s relatively positive representation of Egypt has sometimes been read as nostalgia for an heroic past. Because the Aristotelian elements were a declining theory in Shakespeare&#x27;s time, it can also be read as nostalgia for a waning theory of the material world, the pre-seventeenth-century cosmos of elements and humours that rendered subject and world deeply interconnected and saturated with meaning. Thus this reflects the difference between the Egyptians who are interconnected with the elemental earth and the Romans in their dominating the hard-surfaced, impervious world.

Critics also suggest that the political attitudes of the main characters are an allegory for the political atmosphere of Shakespeare&#x27;s time. According to Paul Lawrence Rose in his article &quot;The Politics of &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;&quot;, the views expressed in the play of &quot;national solidarity, social order and strong rule&quot; were familiar after the absolute monarchies of Henry VII and Henry VIII and the political disaster involving Mary Queen of Scots. Essentially the political themes throughout the play are reflective of the different models of rule during Shakespeare&#x27;s time. The political attitudes of Antony, Caesar, and Cleopatra are all basic archetypes for the conflicting sixteenth-century views of kingship. Caesar is representative of the ideal king, who brings about the Pax Romana similar to the political peace established under the Tudors. His cold demeanour is representative of what the sixteenth century thought to be a side-effect of political genius. Conversely, Antony&#x27;s focus is on valour and chivalry, and Antony views the political power of victory as a by-product of both. Cleopatra&#x27;s power has been described as &quot;naked, hereditary, and despotic&quot;, and it is argued that she is reminiscent of Mary Tudor&#x27;s reign—implying it is not coincidence that she brings about the &quot;doom of Egypt.&quot; This is in part due to an emotional comparison in their rule. Cleopatra, who was emotionally invested in Antony, brought about the downfall of Egypt in her commitment to love, whereas Mary Tudor&#x27;s emotional attachment to Catholicism fates her rule. The political implications within the play reflect on Shakespeare&#x27;s England in its message that Impact is not a match for Reason.

==== The characterization of Rome and Egypt ====

Critics have often used the opposition between Rome and Egypt in &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; to set forth defining characteristics of the various characters. While some characters are distinctly Egyptian, others are distinctly Roman, some are torn between the two, and still others attempt to remain neutral. Critic James Hirsh has stated that, &quot;as a result, the play dramatises not two but four main figurative locales: Rome as it is perceived from a Roman point of view; Rome as it is perceived from an Egyptian point of view; Egypt as it is perceived from a Roman point of view; and Egypt as it is perceived from an Egyptian point of view.&quot;

===== Rome from the Roman perspective =====
According to Hirsh, Rome largely defines itself by its opposition to Egypt. Where Rome is viewed as structured, moral, mature, and essentially masculine, Egypt is the polar opposite; chaotic, immoral, immature, and feminine. In fact, even the distinction between masculine and feminine is a purely Roman idea which the Egyptians largely ignore. The Romans view the &quot;world&quot; as nothing more than something for them to conquer and control. They believe they are &quot;impervious to environmental influence&quot; and that they are not to be influenced and controlled by the world but vice versa.

===== Rome from the Egyptian perspective =====
The Egyptians view the Romans as boring, oppressive, strict and lacking in passion and creativity, preferring strict rules and regulations.

===== Egypt from the Egyptian perspective =====
The Egyptian worldview reflects what Mary Floyd-Wilson has called geo-humoralism, or the belief that climate and other environmental factors shapes racial character. The Egyptians view themselves as deeply entwined with the natural &quot;earth&quot;. Egypt is not a location for them to rule over, but an inextricable part of them. Cleopatra envisions herself as the embodiment of Egypt because she has been nurtured and moulded by the environment fed by &quot;the dung, / The beggar&#x27;s nurse and Caesar&#x27;s&quot; (5.2.7–8). They view life as more fluid and less structured allowing for creativity and passionate pursuits.

===== Egypt from the Roman perspective =====
The Romans view the Egyptians essentially as improper. Their passion for life is continuously viewed as irresponsible, indulgent, over-sexualised and disorderly. The Romans view Egypt as a distraction that can send even the best men off course. This is demonstrated in the following passage describing Antony.

&lt;poem&gt;
Boys who, being mature in knowledge,
Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
And so rebel judgment.
(1.4.31–33)
&lt;/poem&gt;

Ultimately the dichotomy between Rome and Egypt is used to distinguish two sets of conflicting values between two different locales. Yet, it goes beyond this division to show the conflicting sets of values not only between two cultures but within cultures, even within individuals. As John Gillies has argued &quot;the &#x27;orientalism&#x27; of Cleopatra&#x27;s court—with its luxury, decadence, splendour, sensuality, appetite, effeminacy and eunuchs—seems a systematic inversion of the legendary Roman values of temperance, manliness, courage&quot;. While some characters fall completely into the category of Roman or Egyptian (Octavius as Roman, Cleopatra Egyptian) others, such as Antony, cannot choose between the two conflicting locales and cultures. Instead he oscillates between the two. In the beginning of the play Cleopatra calls attention to this saying

&lt;poem&gt;
He was dispos&#x27;d to mirth, but on the sudden
A Roman thought hath strook him.
(1.2.82–83)
&lt;/poem&gt;

This shows Antony&#x27;s willingness to embrace the pleasures of Egyptian life, yet his tendency to still be drawn back into Roman thoughts and ideas.

Orientalism plays a very specific, and yet, nuanced role in the story of Antony and Cleopatra. A more specific term comes to mind, from Richmond Barbour, that of proto-orientalism, that is orientalism before the age of imperialism. This puts Antony and Cleopatra in an interesting period of time, one that existed before the West knew much about what would eventually be called the Orient, but still a time where it was known that there were lands beyond Europe. This allowed Shakespeare to use widespread assumptions about the &quot;exotic&quot; east with little academic recourse. It could be said that Antony and Cleopatra and their relationship represent the first meeting of the two cultures in a literary sense, and that this relationship would lay the foundation for the idea of Western superiority vs. Eastern inferiority. The case could also be made that at least in a literary sense, the relationship between Antony and Cleopatra was some people&#x27;s first exposure to an inter-racial relationship, and in a major way. This plays into the idea that Cleopatra has been made out to be an &quot;other&quot;, with terms used to describe her like &quot;gypsy&quot;. And it is this otherization that is at the heart of the piece itself, the idea that Antony, a man of Western origin and upbringing has coupled himself with the Eastern women, the stereotypical &quot;other&quot;.

==== Evolving views of critics regarding gender characterizations ====
Feminist criticism of &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; has provided a more in-depth reading of the play, has challenged previous norms for criticism, and has opened a larger discussion of the characterization of Egypt and Rome. However, as Gayle Greene so aptly recognises, it must be addressed that &quot;feminist criticism [of Shakespeare] is nearly as concerned with the biases of Shakespeare&#x27;s interpretors —critics, directors, editors—as with Shakespeare himself.&quot;

Feminist scholars, in respect to &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, often examine Shakespeare&#x27;s use of language when describing Rome and Egypt. Through his language, such scholars argue, he tends to characterise Rome as &quot;masculine&quot; and Egypt as &quot;feminine.&quot; According to Gayle Greene, &quot;the &#x27;feminine&#x27; world of love and personal relationships is secondary to the &#x27;masculine&#x27; world of war and politics, [and] has kept us from realizing that Cleopatra is the play&#x27;s protagonist, and so skewed our perceptions of character, theme, and structure.&quot; The highlighting of these starkly contrasting qualities of the two backdrops of &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, in both Shakespeare&#x27;s language and the words of critics, brings attention to the characterization of the title characters, since their respective countries are meant to represent and emphasise their attributes.

The feminine categorization of Egypt, and subsequently Cleopatra, was negatively portrayed throughout early criticism. The story of &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; was often summarised as either &quot;the fall of a great general, betrayed in his dotage by a treacherous strumpet, or else it can be viewed as a celebration of transcendental love.&quot; In both reduced summaries, Egypt and Cleopatra are presented as either the destruction of Antony&#x27;s masculinity and greatness or as agents in a love story. Once the Women&#x27;s Liberation Movement grew between the 1960s and 1980s, however, critics began to take a closer look at both Shakespeare&#x27;s characterization of Egypt and Cleopatra and the work and opinions of other critics on the same matter.

Jonathan Gil Harris claims that the Egypt vs. Rome dichotomy many critics often adopt does not only represent a &quot;gender polarity&quot; but also a &quot;gender hierarchy&quot;. Critical approaches to &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; from the beginning of the 20th century mostly adopt a reading that places Rome as higher in the hierarchy than Egypt. Early critics like Georg Brandes presented Egypt as a lesser nation because of its lack of rigidity and structure and presented Cleopatra, negatively, as &quot;the woman of women, quintessentiated Eve.&quot; Egypt and Cleopatra are both represented by Brandes as uncontrollable because of their connection with the Nile River and Cleopatra&#x27;s &quot;infinite variety&quot; (2.2.236).

In more recent years, critics have taken a closer look at previous readings of &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; and have found several aspects overlooked. Egypt was previously characterised as the nation of the feminine attributes of lust and desire while Rome was more controlled. However, Harris points out that Caesar and Antony both possess an uncontrollable desire for Egypt and Cleopatra: Caesar&#x27;s is political while Antony&#x27;s is personal. Harris further implies that Romans have an uncontrollable lust and desire for &quot;what they do not or cannot have.&quot; For example, Antony only desires his wife Fulvia after she is dead:

&lt;poem&gt;
There&#x27;s a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:
What our contempt doth often hurl from us,
We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,
By revolution lowering, does become
The opposite of itself: she&#x27;s good, being gone:
The hand could pluck her back that shov&#x27;d her on.
(1.2.119–124)
&lt;/poem&gt;

In this way, Harris is suggesting that Rome is no higher on any &quot;gender hierarchy&quot; than Egypt.

L. T. Fitz outwardly claims that early criticism of &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; is &quot;colored by the sexist assumptions the critics have brought with them to their reading.&quot; Fitz argues that previous criticisms place a heavy emphasis on Cleopatra&#x27;s &quot;wicked and manipulative&quot; ways, which are further emphasised by her association with Egypt and her contrast to the &quot;chaste and submissive&quot; Roman Octavia. Finally, Fitz emphasises the tendency of early critics to assert that Antony is the sole protagonist of the play. This claim is apparent in Brandes‘ argument: &quot;when [Antony] perishes, a prey to the voluptuousness of the East, it seems as though Roman greatness and the Roman Republic expires with him.&quot; Yet Fitz points out that Antony dies in Act IV while Cleopatra (and therefore Egypt) is present throughout Act V until she commits suicide at the end and &quot;would seem to fulfill at least the formal requirements of the tragic hero.&quot;

These criticisms are only a few examples of how the critical views of Egypt&#x27;s &quot;femininity&quot; and Rome&#x27;s &quot;masculinity&quot; have changed over time and how the development of feminist theory has helped in widening the discussion.

=== Themes and motifs ===

==== Ambiguity and opposition ====

Relativity and ambiguity are prominent ideas in the play, and the audience is challenged to come to conclusions about the ambivalent nature of many of the characters. The relationship between Antony and Cleopatra can easily be read as one of love or lust; their passion can be construed as being wholly destructive but also showing elements of transcendence. Cleopatra might be said to kill herself out of love for Antony, or because she has lost political power. Octavius can be seen as either a noble and good ruler, only wanting what is right for Rome, or as a cruel and ruthless politician.

A major theme running through the play is opposition. Throughout the play, oppositions between Rome and Egypt, love and lust, and masculinity and femininity are emphasised, subverted, and commented on. One of Shakespeare&#x27;s most famous speeches, drawn almost verbatim from North&#x27;s translation of Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Lives&quot;, Enobarbus&#x27; description of Cleopatra on her barge, is full of opposites resolved into a single meaning, corresponding with these wider oppositions that characterise the rest of the play:

&lt;poem&gt;The barge she sat in, like a burnish&#x27;d throne,
Burn&#x27;d on the water...
...she did lie
In her pavilion—cloth-of-gold of tissue—
O&#x27;er-picturing that Venus where we see
The fancy outwork nature: on each side her
Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
With divers-colour&#x27;d fans, whose wind did seem
To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
And what they undid did. (Act 2, Scene 2)&lt;/poem&gt;

Cleopatra herself sees Antony as both the Gorgon and Mars (Act 2 Scene 5, lines 118–119).

=====Theme of ambivalence=====

The play is accurately structured with paradox and ambivalence in order to convey the antitheses that make Shakespeare&#x27;s work remarkable.
Ambivalence in this play is the contrasting response of one&#x27;s own character. It may be perceived as opposition between word and deed but not to be confused with &quot;duality.&quot; For example, after Antony abandons his army during the sea battle to follow Cleopatra, he expresses his remorse and pain in his famous speech:

&lt;poem&gt;
All is lost; 
This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me: 
My fleet hath yielded to the foe; and yonder
They cast their caps up and carouse together 
Like friends long lost. Triple-turn&#x27;d whore! &#x27;tis thou 
Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart 
Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;
For when I am revenged upon my charm,
I have done all. Bid them all fly; begone. [Exit SCARUS] 
O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more: 
Fortune and Antony part here; even here
Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts 
That spaniel&#x27;d me at heels, to whom I gave 
Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets 
On blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark&#x27;d,
That overtopp&#x27;d them all. Betray&#x27;d I am:
O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm,— 
Whose eye beck&#x27;d forth my wars, and call&#x27;d them home; 
Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,— 
Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,
Beguiled me to the very heart of loss.
What, Eros, Eros! [Enter CLEOPATRA] Ah, thou spell! Avaunt! (IV.12.2913–2938)
&lt;/poem&gt;

However, he then strangely says to Cleopatra: &quot;All that is won and lost. Give me a kiss. Even this repays me&quot;(3.12.69–70). Antony&#x27;s speech conveys pain and anger, but he acts in opposition to his emotions and words, all for the love of Cleopatra. Literary critic Joyce Carol Oates explains: &quot;Antony&#x27;s agony is curiously muted for someone who has achieved and lost so much.&quot; This irony gap between word and deed of the characters results in a theme of ambivalence. Moreover, due to the flow of constant changing emotions throughout the play: &quot;the characters do not know each other, nor can we know them, any more clearly than we know ourselves&quot;. However, it is believed by critics that opposition is what makes good fiction. Another example of ambivalence in &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; is in the opening act of the play when Cleopatra asks Anthony: &quot;Tell me how much you love.&quot; Tzachi Zamir points out: &quot;The persistence of doubt is in perpetual tension with the opposing need for certainty&quot; and he refers to the persistence of doubt that derives from the contradiction of word and deed in the characters.

==== Betrayal ====

Betrayal is a recurring theme throughout the play. At one time or another, almost every character betrays their country, ethics, or a companion. However, certain characters waver between betrayal and loyalty. This struggle is most apparent in the actions of Cleopatra, Enobarbus, and most importantly Antony. Antony mends ties with his Roman roots and alliance with Caesar by entering into a marriage with Octavia, but he returns to Cleopatra. Diana Kleiner points out, &quot;Anthony&#x27;s perceived betrayal of Rome was greeted with public calls for war with Egypt&quot;. Although he vows to remain loyal in his marriage, his impulses and unfaithfulness to his Roman roots are what ultimately lead to war. Cleopatra twice abandons Antony during battle and whether out of fear or political motives, she deceived Antony. When Thidias, Caesar&#x27;s messenger, tells Cleopatra Caesar will show her mercy if she will relinquish Antony, she is quick to respond:

&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;Most kind messenger,
Say to great Caesar this in deputation:
I kiss his conqu&#x27;ring hand. Tell him I am prompt
To lay my crown at &#x27;s feet, and there to kneel.&quot; (III.13.75–79)
&lt;/poem&gt;

Shakespeare critic Sara Deats says Cleopatra&#x27;s betrayal fell &quot;on the successful fencing with Octavius that leaves her to be &quot;noble to [herself]&quot;. However, she quickly reconciles with Antony, reaffirming her loyalty towards him and never truly submitting to Caesar.
Enobarbus, Antony&#x27;s most devoted friend, betrays Antony when he deserts him in favour of Caesar. But he exclaims, &quot;I fight against thee! / No: I will go seek some ditch wherein to die&quot; (IV. 6. 38–39). Although he abandoned Antony, critic Kent Cartwright claims Enobarbus&#x27; death &quot;uncovers his greater love&quot; for him considering it was caused by the guilt for what he had done to his friend, thus adding to the confusion of the characters&#x27; loyalty and betrayal that previous critics have also discovered. Even though loyalty is central to secure alliances, Shakespeare is making a point with the theme of betrayal by exposing how people in power cannot be trusted, no matter how honest their word may seem. The characters&#x27; loyalty and validity of promises are constantly called into question. The perpetual swaying between alliances strengthens the ambiguity and uncertainty amid the characters&#x27; loyalty and disloyalty.

==== Power dynamics ====
As a play concerning the relationship between two empires, the dynamics of power becomes a recurring theme. Antony and Cleopatra battle over this dynamic as heads of state, yet the theme of power also resonates in their romantic relationship. The Roman ideal of power lies in a political nature taking a base in economical control. As an imperialist power, Rome takes its power in the ability to change the world. As a Roman man, Antony is expected to fulfill certain qualities pertaining to his Roman masculine power, especially in the war arena and in his duty as a soldier:
&lt;poem&gt;
Those his goodly eyes,
That o&#x27;er the files and musters of the war
Have glowed like plated mars, now bend, now turn
The office and devotion of their view
Upon a tawny front. His captain&#x27;s heart,
Which in the scuffles of greatness hath burst
The buckles on his breast, reneges all tempers,
And is becomes the bellows and the fan
To cool a gipsy&#x27;s lust.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Cleopatra&#x27;s character is slightly unpindown-able, as her character identity retains a certain aspect of mystery. She embodies the mystical, exotic, and dangerous nature of Egypt as the &quot;serpent of old Nile&quot;. Critic Lisa Starks says that &quot;Cleopatra [comes] to signify the double-image of the &quot;temptress/goddess&quot;. She is continually described in unearthly terms, extending to her description as the goddess Venus.

&lt;poem&gt;
...For her own person,
It beggared all description. She did lie
In her pavilion—cloth of gold, of tissue—
O&#x27;er-picturing that Venus where we see
The fancy outwork nature.
&lt;/poem&gt;

This mysteriousness connected with the supernatural not only captures the audience and Antony, but also draws all other characters&#x27; focus. As a subject of conversation even when not present in the scene, Cleopatra is continually a central point, therefore demanding control of the stage. As an object of sexual desire, she is connected to the Roman need to conquer. Her mixture of sexual prowess with political power is a threat to Roman politics. She retains her deep involvement in the military aspect of her rule, especially when she asserts herself as &quot;the president of [her] kingdom will/ Appear there for a man.&quot; Where the dominating power lies is up for interpretation, yet there are several mentions of the power exchange in their relationship in the text. Antony remarks on Cleopatra&#x27;s power over him multiple times throughout the play, the most obvious being sexual innuendo: &quot;You did know / How much you were my conqueror, and that / My sword, made weak by my affection, would / Obey it on all cause.&quot;

==== Use of language in power dynamics ====
Manipulation and the quest for power are very prominent themes not only in the play but specifically in the relationship between Antony and Cleopatra. Both utilise language to undermine the power of the other and to heighten their own sense of power.

Cleopatra uses language to undermine Antony&#x27;s assumed authority over her. Cleopatra&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;Roman&#x27; language of command works to undermine Antony&#x27;s authority.&quot; By using a Romanesque rhetoric, Cleopatra commands Antony and others in Antony&#x27;s own style. In their first exchange in Act I, scene 1, Cleopatra says to Antony, &quot;I&#x27;ll set a bourn how far to be beloved.&quot; In this case Cleopatra speaks in an authoritative and affirming sense to her lover, which to Shakespeare&#x27;s audience would be uncharacteristic for a female lover.

Antony&#x27;s language suggests his struggle for power against Cleopatra&#x27;s dominion. Antony&#x27;s &quot;obsessive language concerned with structure, organization, and maintenance for the self and empire in repeated references to &#x27;measure,&#x27; &#x27;property,&#x27; and &#x27;rule&#x27; express unconscious anxieties about boundary integrity and violation.&quot; (Hooks 38) Furthermore, Antony struggles with his infatuation with Cleopatra and this paired with Cleopatra&#x27;s desire for power over him causes his eventual downfall. He states in Act I, scene 2, &quot;These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,/Or lose myself in dotage.&quot; Antony feels restrained by &quot;Egyptian fetters&quot; indicating that he recognises Cleopatra&#x27;s control over him. He also mentions losing himself in dotage—&quot;himself&quot; referring to Antony as Roman ruler and authority over people including Cleopatra.

Cleopatra also succeeds in causing Antony to speak in a more theatrical sense and therefore undermine his own true authority. In Act I, scene 1, Antony not only speaks again of his empire but constructs a theatrical image: &quot;Let Rome and Tiber melt, and the wide arch/Of the ranged empire fall... The nobleness of life/Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair/And such a twain can do&#x27;t—in which I bind/On pain of punishment the world to weet/We stand up peerless.&quot; Cleopatra immediately says, &quot;Excellent falsehood!&quot; in an aside, indicating to the audience that she intends for Antony to adopt this rhetoric.

Yachnin&#x27;s article focuses on Cleopatra&#x27;s usurping of Antony&#x27;s authority through her own and his language, while Hooks&#x27; article gives weight to Antony&#x27;s attempts to assert his authority through rhetoric. Both articles indicate the lovers&#x27; awareness of each other&#x27;s quests for power. Despite awareness and the political power struggle existent in the play, Antony and Cleopatra both fail to achieve their goals by the play&#x27;s conclusion.

==== Performing gender and crossdressing ====

===== The performance of gender =====
&quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; is essentially a male-dominated play in which the character of Cleopatra takes significance as one of few female figures and definitely the only strong female character. As Oriana Palusci says in her article &quot;When Boys or Women Tell Their Dreams: Cleopatra and the Boy Actor&quot;, &quot;Cleopatra constantly occupies the centre, if not of the stage, certainly of the discourse, often charged with sexual innuendos and disparaging tirades, of the male Roman world&quot;. We see the significance of this figure by the constant mention of her, even when she is not on stage.

What is said about Cleopatra is not always what one would normally say about a ruler; the image that is created makes the audience expect &quot;to see on stage not a noble Sovereign, but a dark, dangerous, evil, sensual and lewd creature who has harnessed the &#x27;captain&#x27;s heart&quot;. This dangerously beautiful woman is difficult for Shakespeare to create because all characters, male or female, were played by men. Phyllis Rackin points out that one of the most descriptive scenes of Cleopatra is spoken by Enobarbus: &quot;in his famous set speech, Enobarbus evokes Cleopatra&#x27;s arrival on the Cynus&quot;. It is an elaborate description that could never possibly be portrayed by a young boy actor. It is in this way that &quot;before the boy [playing Cleopatra] can evoke Cleopatra&#x27;s greatness, he must remind us that he cannot truly represent it&quot;. The images of Cleopatra must be described rather than seen on stage. Rackin points out that &quot;it is a commonplace of the older criticism that Shakespeare had to rely upon his poetry and his audience&#x27;s imagination to evoke Cleopatra&#x27;s greatness because he knew the boy actor could not depict it convincingly&quot;.

The constant comments of the Romans about Cleopatra often undermine her, representing the Roman thought on the foreign and particularly of Egyptians. From the perspective of the reason-driven Romans, Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Egyptian queen repeatedly violates the rules of decorum&quot;. It is because of this distaste that Cleopatra &quot;embodies political power, a power which is continuously underscored, denied, nullified by the Roman counterpart&quot;. To many of Antony&#x27;s crew, his actions appear extravagant and over the top: &quot;Antony&#x27;s devotion is inordinate and therefore irrational&quot;. It is no wonder, then, that she is such a subordinated queen.

And yet she is also shown as having real power in the play. When threatened to be made a fool and fully overpowered by Octavius, she takes her own life: &quot;She is not to be silenced by the new master, she is the one who will silence herself: &#x27;My resolution and my hands I&#x27;ll trust/ None about Caesar&#x27; (IV. 15.51–52)&quot;. From this, connections can be made between power and the performance of the female role as portrayed by Cleopatra.

===== Interpretations of crossdressing within the play =====
Scholars have speculated that Shakespeare&#x27;s original intention was to have Antony appear in Cleopatra&#x27;s clothes and vice versa in the beginning of the play. This possible interpretation seems to perpetuate the connections being made between gender and power. Gordon P. Jones elaborates on the importance of this detail:

Such a saturnalian exchange of costumes in the opening scene would have opened up a number of important perspectives for the play&#x27;s original audience. It would immediately have established the sportiveness of the lovers. It would have provided a specific theatrical context for Cleopatra&#x27;s later reminiscence about another occasion on which she &quot;put my tires and mantles on him, whilst / I wore his sword Philippan&quot; (II.v.22–23). It would have prepared the ground for Cleopatra&#x27;s subsequent insistence on appearing &quot;for a man&quot; (III.vii.18) to bear a charge in the war; in doing so, it would also have prepared the audience for Antony&#x27;s demeaning acquiescence in her usurpation of the male role.

The evidence that such a costume change was intended includes Enobarbus&#x27; false identification of Cleopatra as Antony:
&lt;poem&gt;
Domitius Enobarbus: Hush! here comes Antony.
Charmian: Not he; the queen.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Enobarbus could have made this error because he was used to seeing Antony in the queen&#x27;s garments. It can also be speculated that Philo was referring to Antony cross-dressing in Act 1, scene 1:
&lt;poem&gt;
Philo: Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,
He comes too short of that great property
Which still should go with Antony.
&lt;/poem&gt;

In the context of cross-dressing, &quot;not Antony&quot; could mean &quot;when Antony is dressed as Cleopatra.&quot;

If Shakespeare had indeed intended for Antony to crossdress, it would have drawn even more similarities between Antony and Hercules, a comparison that many scholars have noted many times before. Hercules (who is said to be an ancestor of Antony) was forced to wear Queen Omphale&#x27;s clothing while he was her indentured servant. The Omphale myth is an exploration of gender roles in Greek society. Shakespeare might have paid homage to this myth as a way of exploring gender roles in his own.

However, it has been noted that, while women dressing as men (i.e., a boy actor acting a female character who dresses as a man) are common in Shakespeare, the reverse (i.e., a male adult actor dressing as a woman) is all but non-existent, leaving aside Antony&#x27;s debated case.

===== Critics&#x27; interpretations of boys portraying female characters =====
&quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; also contains self-references to the crossdressing as it would have been performed historically on the London stage. For instance, in Act Five, Scene Two, Cleopatra exclaims, &quot;Antony/ Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see/ Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness/ I&#x27;th&#x27; posture of a whore&quot; (ll. 214–217). Many scholars interpret these lines as a metatheatrical reference to Shakespeare&#x27;s own production, and by doing so comments on his own stage. Shakespeare critics such as Tracey Sedinger interpret this as Shakespeare&#x27;s critique of the London stage, which, by the perpetuation of boy actors playing the part of the woman, serves to establish the superiority of the male spectator&#x27;s sexuality. The male-male relationship, some critics have offered, between the male audience and the boy actor performing the female sexuality of the play would have been less threatening than had the part been played by a woman. It is in this manner that the London stage cultivated in its audience a chaste and obedient female subject, while positioning male sexuality as dominant. Shakespeare critics argue that the metatheatrical references in &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; seem to critique this trend and the presentation of Cleopatra as a sexually empowered individual supports their argument that Shakespeare seems to be questioning the oppression of female sexuality in London society. The crossdresser, then, is not a visible object but rather a structure &quot;enacting the failure of a dominant epistemology in which knowledge is equated with visibility&quot;. What is being argued here is that the cross-dressing on the London stage challenges the dominant epistemology of Elizabethan society that associated sight with knowledge. The boy actors portraying female sexuality on the London stage contradicted such a simple ontology.

Critics such as Rackin interpret Shakespeare&#x27;s metatheatrical references to the crossdressing on stage with less concern for societal elements and more of a focus on the dramatic ramifications. Rackin argues in her article on &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Boy Cleopatra&quot; that Shakespeare manipulates the crossdressing to highlight a motif of the play—recklessness—which is discussed in the article as the recurring elements of acting without properly considering the consequences. Rackin cites the same quote, &quot;Antony/ Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see/ Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness/ I&#x27;th&#x27; posture of a whore&quot; to make the argument that here the audience is reminded of the very same treatment Cleopatra is receiving on Shakespeare&#x27;s stage (since she is being portrayed by a boy actor) (V.ii.214–217). Shakespeare, utilizing the metatheatrical reference to his own stage, perpetuates his motif of recklessness by purposefully shattering &quot;the audience&#x27;s acceptance of the dramatic illusion&quot;.

Other critics argue that the crossdressing as it occurs in the play is less of a mere convention, and more of an embodiment of dominant power structures. Critics such as Charles Forker argue that the boy actors were a result of what &quot;we may call androgyny&quot;. His article argues that &quot;women were barred from the stage for their own sexual protection&quot; and because &quot;patriarchally acculturated audiences presumably found it intolerable to see English women—those who would represent mothers, wives, and daughters—in sexually compromising situations&quot;. Essentially, the crossdressing occurs as a result of the patriarchally structured society.

==== Empire ====

===== Sexuality and empire =====

The textual motif of empire within &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; has strong gendered and erotic undercurrents. Antony, the Roman soldier characterised by a certain effeminacy, is the main article of conquest, falling first to Cleopatra and then to Caesar (Octavius). Cleopatra&#x27;s triumph over her lover is attested to by Caesar himself, who gibes that Antony &quot;is not more manlike/ Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy/ More womanly than he&quot; (1.4.5–7). That Cleopatra takes on the role of male aggressor in her relationship with Antony should not be surprising; after all, &quot;a culture attempting to dominate another culture will [often] endow itself with masculine qualities and the culture it seeks to dominate with feminine ones&quot;—appropriately, the queen&#x27;s romantic assault is frequently imparted in a political, even militaristic fashion. Antony&#x27;s subsequent loss of manhood seemingly &quot;signifies his lost Romanness, and Act 3, Scene 10, is a virtual litany of his lost and feminised self, his &quot;wounder chance&quot;. Throughout the play, Antony is gradually bereaved of that Roman quality so coveted in his nostalgic interludes—by the centremost scenes, his sword (a plainly phallic image), he tells Cleopatra, has been &quot;made weak by his affection&quot; (3.11.67). In Act 4, Scene 14, &quot;an un-Romaned Antony&quot; laments, &quot;O, thy vile lady!/ She has robb&#x27;d me of my sword&quot;, (22–23)—critic Arthur L. Little Jr. writes that here &quot;he seems to echo closely the victim of raptus, of bride theft, who has lost the sword she wishes to turn against herself. By the time Antony tries to use his sword to kill himself, it amounts to little more than a stage prop&quot;. Antony is reduced to a political object, &quot;the pawn in a power game between Caesar and Cleopatra&quot;.

Having failed to perform Roman masculinity and virtue, Antony&#x27;s only means with which he might &quot;write himself into Rome&#x27;s imperial narrative and position himself at the birth of empire&quot; is to cast himself in the feminine archetype of the sacrificial virgin; &quot;once [he] understands his failed virtus, his failure to be Aeneas, he then tries to emulate Dido&quot;. &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; can be read as a rewrite of Virgil&#x27;s epic, with the sexual roles reversed and sometimes inverted. James J Greene writes on the subject: &quot;If one of the seminally powerful myths in the cultural memory of our past is Aeneas&#x27; rejection of his African queen in order to go on and found the Roman Empire, than it is surely significant that Shakespeare&#x27;s ... depicts precisely and quite deliberately the opposite course of action from that celebrated by Virgil. For Antony... turned his back for the sake of his African queen on that same Roman state established by Aeneas&quot;. Antony even attempts to commit suicide for his love, falling short in the end. He is incapable of &quot;occupying the... politically empowering place&quot; of the female sacrificial victim. The abundant imagery concerning his person—&quot;of penetration, wounds, blood, marriage, orgasm, and shame&quot;—informs the view of some critics that the Roman &quot;figures Antony&#x27;s body as queer, that is, as an open male body... [he] not only &#x27;bends&#x27; in devotion&#x27; but... bends over&quot;. In reciprocal contrast, &quot;in both Caesar and Cleopatra we see very active wills and energetic pursuit of goals&quot;. While Caesar&#x27;s empirical objective can be considered strictly political, however, Cleopatra&#x27;s is explicitly erotic; she conquers carnally—indeed, &quot;she made great Caesar lay his sword to bed;/ He plough&#x27;d her, and she cropp&#x27;d&quot; (2.2.232–233). Her mastery is unparalleled when it comes to the seduction of certain powerful individuals, but popular criticism supports the notion that &quot;as far as Cleopatra is concerned, the main thrust of the play&#x27;s action might be described as a machine especially devised to bend her to the Roman will... and no doubt Roman order is sovereign at the end of the play. But instead of driving her down to ignominy, the Roman power forces her upward to nobility&quot;. Caesar says of her final deed, &quot;Bravest at the last,/ She levelled at our purposes, and, being royal,/ Took her own way&quot; (5.2.325–327).

Arthur L. Little, in agitative fashion, suggests that the desire to overcome the queen has a corporeal connotation: &quot;If a black—read foreign—man raping a white woman encapsulates an iconographic truth... of the dominant society&#x27;s sexual, racial, national, and imperial fears, a white man raping a black woman becomes the evidentiary playing out of its self-assured and cool stranglehold over these representative foreign bodies&quot;. Furthermore, he writes, &quot;Rome shapes its Egyptian imperial struggle most visually around the contours of Cleopatra&#x27;s sexualised and racialised black body—most explicitly her &quot;tawny front&quot;, her &quot;gipsy&#x27;s lust&quot;, and her licentious climactic genealogy, &quot;with Phoebus&#x27; amorous pinches black&quot;. In a similar vein, essayist David Quint contends that &quot;with Cleopatra the opposition between East and West is characterised in terms of gender: the otherness of the Easterner becomes the otherness of the opposite sex&quot;. Quint argues that Cleopatra (not Antony) fulfils Virgil&#x27;s Dido archetype; &quot;woman is subordinated as is generally the case in &quot;The Aeneid&quot;, excluded from power and the process of Empire-building: this exclusion is evident in the poem&#x27;s fiction where Creusa disappears and Dido is abandoned... woman&#x27;s place or displacement is therefore in the East, and epic features a series of oriental heroines whose seductions are potentially more perilous than Eastern arms&quot;, i.e., Cleopatra.

===== Politics of empire =====

&quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; deals ambiguously with the politics of imperialism and colonization. Critics have long been invested in untangling the web of political implications that characterise the play. Interpretations of the work often rely on an understanding of Egypt and Rome as they respectively signify Elizabethan ideals of East and West, contributing to a long-standing conversation about the play&#x27;s representation of the relationship between imperializing western countries and colonised eastern cultures. Despite Octavius Caesar&#x27;s concluding victory and the absorption of Egypt into Rome, &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; resists clear-cut alignment with Western values. Indeed, Cleopatra&#x27;s suicide has been interpreted as suggesting an indomitable quality in Egypt, and reaffirming Eastern culture as a timeless contender to the West. However, particularly in earlier criticism, the narrative trajectory of Rome&#x27;s triumph and Cleopatra&#x27;s perceived weakness as a ruler have allowed readings that privilege Shakespeare&#x27;s representation of a Roman worldview. Octavius Caesar is seen as Shakespeare&#x27;s portrayal of an ideal governor, though perhaps an unfavourable friend or lover, and Rome is emblematic of reason and political excellence. According to this reading, Egypt is viewed as destructive and vulgar; the critic Paul Lawrence Rose writes: &quot;Shakespeare clearly envisages Egypt as a political hell for the subject, where natural rights count for nothing.&quot; Through the lens of such a reading, the ascendancy of Rome over Egypt does not speak to the practice of empire-building as much as it suggests the inevitable advantage of reason over sensuality.

More contemporary scholarship on the play, however, has typically recognised the allure of Egypt for &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;″s audiences. Egypt&#x27;s magnetism and seeming cultural primacy over Rome have been explained by efforts to contextualise the political implications of the play within its period of production. The various protagonists&#x27; ruling styles have been identified with rulers contemporary to Shakespeare. For example, there appears to be continuity between the character of Cleopatra and the historical figure of Queen Elizabeth I, and the unfavourable light cast on Caesar has been explained as deriving from the claims of various 16th-century historians.

The more recent influence of New Historicism and post-colonial studies have yielded readings of Shakespeare that typify the play as subversive, or challenging the status quo of Western imperialism. The critic Abigail Scherer&#x27;s claim that &quot;Shakespeare&#x27;s Egypt is a holiday world&quot; recalls the criticisms of Egypt put forth by earlier scholarship and disputes them. Scherer and critics who recognise the wide appeal of Egypt have connected the spectacle and glory of Cleopatra&#x27;s greatness with the spectacle and glory of the theatre itself. Plays, as breeding grounds of idleness, were subject to attack by all levels of authority in the 1600s; the play&#x27;s celebration of pleasure and idleness in a subjugated Egypt makes it plausible to draw parallels between Egypt and the heavily censored theatre culture in England. In the context of England&#x27;s political atmosphere, Shakespeare&#x27;s representation of Egypt, as the greater source of poetry and imagination, resists support for 16th century colonial practices. Importantly, King James&#x27; sanction of the founding of Jamestown occurred within months of &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;″s debut on stage. England during the Renaissance found itself in an analogous position to the early Roman Republic. Shakespeare&#x27;s audience may have made the connection between England&#x27;s westward expansion and &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;″s convoluted picture of Roman imperialism. In support of the reading of Shakespeare&#x27;s play as subversive, it has also been argued that 16th century audiences would have interpreted &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;″s depiction of different models of government as exposing inherent weaknesses in an absolutist, imperial, and by extension monarchical, political state.

===== Empire and intertextuality =====

One of the ways to read the imperialist themes of the play is through a historical, political context with an eye for intertextuality. Many scholars suggest that Shakespeare possessed an extensive knowledge of the story of Antony and Cleopatra through the historian Plutarch, and used Plutarch&#x27;s account as a blueprint for his own play. A closer look at this intertextual link reveals that Shakespeare used, for instance, Plutarch&#x27;s assertion that Antony claimed a genealogy that led back to Hercules, and constructed a parallel to Cleopatra by often associating her with Dionysus in his play. The implication of this historical mutability is that Shakespeare is transposing non-Romans upon his Roman characters, and thus his play assumes a political agenda rather than merely committing itself to a historical recreation. Shakespeare deviates from a strictly obedient observation of Plutarch, though, by complicating a simple dominant/dominated dichotomy with formal choices. For instance, the quick exchange of dialogue might suggest a more dynamic political conflict. Furthermore, certain characteristics of the characters, like Antony whose &quot;legs bestrid the ocean&quot; (5.2.82) point to constant change and mutability. Plutarch, on the other hand, was given to &quot;tendencies to stereotype, to polarise, and to exaggerate that are inherent in the propaganda surrounding his subjects.&quot;

Furthermore, because of the unlikelihood that Shakespeare would have had direct access to the Greek text of Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Parallel Lives&quot; and probably read it through a French translation from a Latin translation, his play constructs Romans with an anachronistic Christian sensibility that might have been influenced by St. Augustine&#x27;s &quot;Confessions&quot; among others. As Miles writes, the ancient world would not have been aware of interiority and the contingence of salvation upon conscience until Augustine. For the Christian world, salvation relied on and belonged to the individual, while the Roman world viewed salvation as political. So, Shakespeare&#x27;s characters in &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, particularly Cleopatra in her belief that her own suicide is an exercise of agency, exhibit a Christian understanding of salvation.

Another example of deviance from the source material is how Shakespeare characterises the rule of Antony and Cleopatra. While Plutarch singles out the &quot;order of exclusive society&quot; that the lovers surrounded themselves with—a society with a specifically defined and clear understanding of the hierarchies of power as determined by birth and status—Shakespeare&#x27;s play seems more preoccupied with the power dynamics of pleasure as a main theme throughout the play. Once pleasure has become a dynamic of power, then it permeates society and politics. Pleasure serves as a differentiating factor between Cleopatra and Antony, between Egypt and Rome, and can be read as the fatal flaw of the heroes if &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot; is a tragedy. For Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, the exclusivity and superiority supplied by pleasure created the disconnect between the ruler and the subjects. Critics suggest that Shakespeare did similar work with these sources in &quot;Othello&quot;, &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, and &quot;Coriolanus&quot;.

====Fortune and chance: politics and nature====

The concept of luck, or Fortune, is frequently referenced throughout &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, portrayed as an elaborate &quot;game&quot; that the characters participate in. An element of Fate lies within the play&#x27;s concept of Chance, as the subject of Fortune/Chance&#x27;s favour at any particular moment becomes the most successful character. Shakespeare represents Fortune through elemental and astronomical imagery that recalls the characters&#x27; awareness of the &quot;unreliability of the natural world&quot;. This calls into question the extent to which the characters&#x27; actions influence the resulting consequences, and whether the characters are subject to the preferences of Fortune or Chance. Antony eventually realises that he, like other characters, is merely &quot;Fortune&#x27;s knave&quot;, a mere card in the game of Chance rather than a player. This realization suggests that Antony realises that he is powerless in relation to the forces of Chance, or Fortune. The manner in which the characters deal with their luck is of great importance, therefore, as they may destroy their chances of luck by taking advantage of their fortune to excessive lengths without censoring their actions, as Antony did. Scholar Marilyn Williamson notes that the characters may spoil their Fortune by, &quot;riding too high&quot; on it, as Antony did by ignoring his duties in Rome and spending time in Egypt with Cleopatra. While Fortune does play a large role in the characters&#x27; lives, they do have ability to exercise free will, however; as Fortune is not as restrictive as Fate. Antony&#x27;s actions suggest this, as he is able to use his free will to take advantage of his luck by choosing his own actions. Like the natural imagery used to describe Fortune, scholar Michael Lloyd characterises it as an element itself, which causes natural occasional upheaval. This implies that fortune is a force of nature that is greater than mankind, and cannot be manipulated. The &#x27;game of chance&#x27; that Fortune puts into play can be related to that of politics, expressing the fact that the characters must play their luck in both fortune and politics to identify a victor. The play culminates, however, in Antony&#x27;s realization that he is merely a card, not a player in this game.

The motif of &quot;card playing&quot; has a political undertone, as it relates to the nature of political dealings. Caesar and Antony take action against each other as if playing a card game; playing by the rules of Chance, which sways in its preference from time to time. Although Caesar and Antony may play political cards with each other, their successes rely somewhat on Chance, which hints at a certain limit to the control they have over political affairs. Furthermore, the constant references to astronomical bodies and &quot;sublunar&quot; imagery connote a Fate-like quality to the character of Fortune, implying a lack of control on behalf of the characters. Although the characters do exercise free will to a certain extent, their success in regard to their actions ultimately depends on the luck that Fortune bestows upon them. The movement of the &quot;moon&quot; and the &quot;tides&quot; is frequently mentioned throughout the play, such as when Cleopatra states that, upon Antony&#x27;s death, there is nothing of importance left &quot;beneath the moon.&quot; The elemental and astronomical &quot;sublunar&quot; imagery frequently referred to throughout the play is thus intertwined with the political manipulation that each character incites, yet the resulting winner of the political &quot;game&quot; relies in part on Chance, which has a supreme quality that the characters cannot maintain control over, and therefore must submit to.

<text>The Deobandi movement or Deobandism is a revivalist movement within Sunni Islam that adheres to the Hanafi school of law. It was formed in the late 19th century around the Darul Uloom Madrassa in Deoband, India, from which the name derives, by Muhammad Qasim Nanautavi, Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, Ashraf Ali Thanwi and Khalil Ahmad Saharanpuri after the Indian Rebellion of 1857–58. They opposed the influence of non-Muslim cultures on the Muslims living in South Asia. The movement pioneered education in religious sciences through the &quot;Dars-i-Nizami&quot; associated with the Lucknow-based of Firangi Mahal with the goal of preserving traditional Islamic teachings from the influx of modernist and secular ideas during British colonial rule. The Deobandi movement&#x27;s Indian clerical wing, Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, was founded in 1919 and played a major role in the Indian independence movement through its participation in the Pan-Islamist &quot;Khilafat&quot; movement and propagation of the doctrine of composite nationalism.

In terms of jurisprudence, the Deobandis uphold the doctrine of &quot;&quot; (conformity to a school of thought) and adhere to the Hanafi school. Founders of the Deobandi school Nanautavi and Gangohi drew inspiration from the religious and political doctrines of the South Asian Islamic scholar, Salafi-oriented Sufi and theologian Ismail Dehlawi (26 April 1779 – 6 May 1831). In its early years, Deobandi scholars engaged in theological debates with Christian and Hindu scholars; with the objective of defending Islamic faith, and to form a popular struggle to overthrow British colonialism. Deobandi theologians of Jamiat Ulema e-Hind, in particular, discussed multiculturalism and opposition to the partition of India, with a strategic vision to safeguard the religious freedom of Muslims in India.

The movement has spread from India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh to the United Kingdom, and has a presence in South Africa. The Pakistani and Afghan branches and the original Indian seminaries have far less contact since the Partition of India, for political reasons related to the India–Pakistan border. Followers of the Deobandi movement are extremely diverse; some advocate for non-violence and others are militant.

== Foundation and expansion ==
British colonialism in India was seen by a group of Indian scholars—consisting of Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, Muhammad Yaqub Nanautawi, Shah Rafi al-Din, Sayyid Muhammad Abid, Zulfiqar Ali, Fazlur Rahman Usmani and Muhammad Qasim Nanotvi—to be corrupting Islam. The group founded an Islamic seminary (&quot;madrassa&quot;) known as Darul Uloom Deoband, here the Islamic revivalist and anti-imperialist ideology of the Deobandis began to develop. In time, the Darul Uloom Deoband became the second largest focal point of Islamic teaching and research after the Al-Azhar University, Cairo. Towards the time of the Indian independence movement and afterward in post-colonial India, the Deobandis advocated a notion of composite nationalism by which Muslims and Hindus were seen as one nation who were asked to be united in the struggle against the British rule.

In 1919, a large group of Deobandi scholars formed the political party Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind and opposed the partition of India. Deobandi scholar Maulana Syed Husain Ahmad Madani helped to spread these ideas through his text &quot;Muttahida Qaumiyat Aur Islam&quot;. A group later dissented from this position and joined Muhammad Ali Jinnah&#x27;s Muslim League, including Ashraf Ali Thanwi, Shabbir Ahmad Usmani, Zafar Ahmad Usmani and Muhammad Shafi Deobandi, who formed the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam in 1945.

Through the organisations such as Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind and Tablighi Jamaat, the Deobandi movement began to spread. Graduates of Darul Uloom Deoband in India from countries such as South Africa, China, and Malaysia opened thousands of &quot;madaaris&quot; throughout the world.

=== India ===
The Deobandi movement in India is managed and spread by Darul Uloom Deoband and the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind.

=== Pakistan ===

Of Pakistan&#x27;s estimated 230 million Muslims, some 15-30% or 40-80 million Pakistani Muslims consider themselves Deobandi, forming majority in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. It is the most followed Movement among Pashtuns and Balochs According to Heritage Online, nearly 65% of the total seminaries (Madrasah) in Pakistan are run by Deobandis, whereas 25% are run by Barelvis, 6% by Ahl-i Hadith and 3% by various Shia organizations. The Deobandi movement in Pakistan was a major recipient of funding from Saudi Arabia from the early 1980s up until the early 2000s, where after this funding was diverted to the rival Ahl-i Hadith movement. Having seen Deoband as a counterbalance to Iranian influence in the region, Saudi funding is now strictly reserved for the Ahl-i Hadith.

Deobandi-affiliated groups such as the TTP, SSP, Let, etc. have a militant character and have attacked and destroyed Sufi sites holy to Sunni Muslims of the Barelvi movement, such as Data Darbar in Lahore, Abdullah Shah Ghazi&#x27;s tomb in Karachi, Khal Magasi in Balochistan, and Rahman Baba&#x27;s tomb in Peshawar.

=== Afghanistan ===
Deobandi Islam is the most popular movement in the Pashtun belt on both sides of the Durand Line that separates Afghanistan and Pakistan. Moreover, prominent Afghan and Pakistani Taliban leaders have studied in Deobandi seminaries.

=== South Africa ===

The Deobandi Movement has an international presence today, with its full-fledged manifestation in South Africa, a country where the movement was initiated through the Indian Gujarati merchant class. The Islamic education system of the Deobandi movement, as well as the necessary components of social and political organizations such as the Tablighi Jamat and Jamiatul Ulama South Africa are fully functioning effectively in South Africa, as they do in India. Madrasas in South Africa provide Islamic higher education and are now centers for Islamic education for foreigners who are interested in receiving a Deobandi-style education. Many of their graduates, especially from Western countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, are Western students. Some of South African madrasas are recognized globally, providing fatwa services. South Africa is now known for producing exceptional Islamic literature through translation and compilation. Similarly, the Tabligh Jamaat is a hub in South Africa that spreads throughout South and East Africa. Graduates of South African madrassas spend their time in service of the Tablighi Jamaat, among them are Muhammad Zakariyya al-Kandhlawi, Masihullah Khan, Mahmood Hasan Gangohi and Asad Madni. South African Deobandi Muslims have many important and influential educational and socio-political organizations that educate the people and play an important role in religious and social activities. Among them are Jamiatul Ulama South Africa and the Muslim Judicial Council.

=== Iran ===

Students from various regions, including Sistan and Baluchestan in Iran, attended Deoband, which led to the spread of its founders ideas. This movement had a significant impact on some of the new generation of Iranian intellectuals in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. After entering Iran, the students of this school continued to expand this thinking and with the formation of missionary groups. These thoughts have been strengthened on one hand due to the cultural relationships between the Baloch tribes and on the other hand due to the connection of Sistan and Baluchestan&#x27;s Iran and India&#x27;s Hanafi religious leaders in Iran. Today, Deobandi thinking is one of the intellectual currents in Sistan and Baluchestan and preaching groups are active in different cities and villages. Its playing a crucial role in Iran&#x27;s political landscape. The Deobandis aimed to homogenize religious schools and were opposed to certain popular practices. The Naqshbandi order played an important role for the Deobandi movement in the Persian-speaking world.

=== United Kingdom ===

In the 1970s, Deobandis opened the first British-based Muslim religious seminaries (Darul-Ulooms), educating imams and religious scholars. Deobandis &quot;have been quietly meeting the religious and spiritual needs of a significant proportion of British Muslims, and are perhaps the most influential British Muslim group.&quot; In 2015 Ofsted highlighted the Deobandi seminary in Holcombe as a good example of a school &quot;promoting British values, preventing radicalisation and protecting children&quot;. The journalist, Andrew Norfolk, did not agree with this assessment.

According to a 2007 report by Andrew Norfolk, published in &quot;The Times&quot;, about 600 of Britain&#x27;s nearly 1,500 mosques were under the control of &quot;a hardline sect&quot;, whose leading preacher loathed Western values, called on Muslims to &quot;shed blood&quot; for Allah and preached contempt for Jews, Christians and Hindus. The same investigative report further said that 17 of the country&#x27;s 26 Islamic seminaries follow the ultra-conservative Deobandi teachings which &quot;The Times&quot; said had given birth to the Taliban. According to &quot;The Times&quot;, almost 80% of all domestically trained Ulema were being trained in these hardline seminaries. An opinion column in &quot;The Guardian&quot; described this report as &quot;a toxic mixture of fact, exaggeration and outright nonsense&quot;.

In 2014 it was reported that 45 per cent of Britain&#x27;s mosques and nearly all the UK-based training of Islamic scholars are controlled by the Deobandis, the largest single Islamic group.

==Beliefs==
The Deobandi movement sees itself as a scholastic tradition that grew out of the Islamic scholastic traditions of the pre-colonial Indian subcontinent and Afghanistan, and it considers its visionary forefather to be Ismail Dehlawi (26 April, 1779 – 6 May, 1831). Dehlawi was a contemporary of Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, and they studied in Medina under some of the same teachers. Muhammad Iqbal said: &quot;The Deobandi movement is neither a creed (Aqidah) nor a denomination (Tayifa) – terms by which its antagonists try to incite the masses against it – but it is a comprehensive picture and a complete edition of the tack of the Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama’ah in which all the offshoots of the Ahl al-Sunnah wal-Jama’ah are seen joined with their root.&quot;

===Theology===

In tenets of faith, the Deobandis follow the Maturidi school of Islamic theology. Their schools teach a short text on beliefs known as &quot;al-&#x27;Aqa&#x27;id al-Nasafiyya&quot; by the Hanafi-Maturidi scholar Najm al-Din &#x27;Umar al-Nasafi.

The official Deobandi book, &quot;al-Muhannad &#x27;ala al-Mufannad&quot; (The Sword on the Disproved), also known as: &quot;al-Tasdiqat li-Daf&#x27; al-Talbisat&quot; (Endorsements Repelling Deceits), is a work that summarizes the beliefs generally held by the Deobandis. It was authored by Khalil Ahmad al-Saharanpuri (d. 1346/1927) in order to defend and remit the Deobandis from the charge of kufr (unbelief or blasphemy) levied against them by their opponents.

According to Brannon D. Ingram, Deobandis differ from Barelvis on three theological positions. Gangohi stated that God has the ability to lie. This doctrine is called &quot;Imkan-i Kizb&quot;. According to this doctrine, because God is omnipotent, God is capable of lying. Gangohi also supported the doctrine that God has the ability to make additional prophets after Muhammad (&quot;Imkan-i Nazir&quot;) and other prophets equal to Muhammad. Gangohi clarifies that although God has the ability to make prophets on &quot;par&quot; with Muhammad, he &quot;would never do so&quot;.

===Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence)===

Deobandis are strong proponents of the doctrine of &quot;Taqlid&quot;. In other words, they believe that a Deobandi must adhere to one of the four schools (madhhabs) of Sunni Islamic Law and discourage inter-school eclecticism. They themselves claim to be the followers of the Hanafi school. Students at madrasas affiliated with the Deobandi movement study the classic books of Hanafi Law such as &quot;Nur al-Idah&quot;, &quot;Mukhtasar al-Quduri&quot;, &quot;Sharh al-Wiqayah&quot;, and &quot;Kanz al-Daqa’iq&quot;, culminating their study of the madhhab with the &quot;Hidayah&quot; of &quot;al-Marghinani&quot;.

With regard to views on &quot;Taqlid&quot;, one of their main opposing reformist groups are the Ahl-i-Hadith, also known as the &quot;Ghair Muqallid&quot;, the nonconformists, because they eschewed &quot;taqlid&quot; in favor of the direct use of Quran and Hadith. They often accuse those who adhere to the rulings of one scholar or legal school of blind imitation&quot;,&quot; and frequently demand scriptural evidence for every argument and legal ruling. Almost since the very beginnings of the movement, Deobandi scholars have generated a copious amount of scholarly output in an attempt to defend their adherence to a &quot;madhhab&quot; in general. In particular, Deobandis have penned much literature in defense of their argument that the Hanafi madhhab is in complete accordance with the &quot;Quran&quot; and &quot;Hadith&quot;.

=== Hadith ===

In response to this need to defend their &quot;madhhab&quot; in the light of scripture, Deobandis became particularly distinguished for their unprecedented salience to the study of &quot;Hadith&quot; in their madrasas. Their &quot;madrasa&quot; curriculum incorporates a feature unique among the global arena of Islamic scholarship, the &quot;Daura-e Hadis&quot;, the capstone year of a student&#x27;s advanced madrasa training, in which all six canonical collections of the Sunni Hadith (the &quot;Sihah Sittah&quot;) are reviewed.

In a Deobandi madrasa, the position of &quot;Shaykh al-Hadith&quot;, or the resident professor of Sahih Bukhari, is held in much reverence. Their views were widely shared by a broad range of Islamic reform movements of the colonial period.

=== Sufism ===

Khalil Ahmad al-Saharanpuri outlined the creedal beliefs of Deobandis in his &quot;Al-Muhannad ala al-Mufannad&quot; where he stated that

However, Deobandis are strictly opposed to celebrating the birthday of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, the celebration of &quot;Urs&quot;, and the &quot;Mourning of Ashura&quot;.&quot;&quot;
Deobandis also reject the building of structures over graves, visitation to the shrines of Sufi saints, as well as the practice of loud &quot;Dhikr, Qawwali, Wajd&quot; and &quot;Sama -&quot; seeing them as too &quot;innovative&quot; in nature&quot;.&quot; Deobandis oppose various forms of Tawassul and Istighatha, which they label as Kufr and Shirk.

Deoband&#x27;s curriculum combined the study of Islamic holy scriptures (Quran, hadith and law) with rational subjects (logic, philosophy and science). At the same time it was hugely Sufi in orientation and affiliated with the Chishti order. Taqi Usmani - the most famous Deobandi scholar was trained in the Chishti order as were the four founders of the Deoband madrassa. Mahmood Ashraf Usmani, the former head of Darul Ulum Karachi, defended the concept of Tariqa and Bay&#x27;ah based on the Pledge of the Tree incident. Ashraf Ali Thanwi graduated from Darul Uloom Deoband and was widely considered a preeminent Sufi of modern India. 

Founders of the Deobandi school, Muhammad Qasim Nanautavi and Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, were inspired by the doctrine of Shah Waliullah amongst other sources of inspiration. Gangohi studied under the Sufi shaykh Haji Imdadullah Muhajir Makki, although he differed with his views in many ways. However Gangohi&#x27;s &quot;Fatawa-yi Rashidiyya&quot; opposed traditional Sufi practices such as loud &quot;dhikr&quot;, visiting the tombs of Sufi saints, celebrating &quot;Urs&quot;, visualizing or contemplating on a Sufi master (&quot;tasawwur-e-shaykh&quot;), reciting the &quot;Fatihah&quot; on special occasions, and engaging in &quot;Sema&quot;.

Gangohi opposed the Sufi doctrine that Muhammad has knowledge of the unseen (&quot;ilm e ghaib&quot;). This belief of the Deobandis conflicts with traditional Sufi views of Muhammad having unparalleled and unequal knowledge that encompasses the unseen realm. Gangohi also issued multiple fatwas against the Mawlid and stated it is an innovation (&quot;bidah&quot;), and opposed the practice of standing up in honour of Muhammad during Mawlid.

Muhammad Zakariyya Kandhlawi, noted hadith scholar and Sufi Shaykh of Deobandis, says that, 

== Scholarship ==
=== Deobandi fiqh ===

Deobandi fiqh, originating from the Hanafi school of Islamic law, is a distinctive school of Islamic jurisprudence that highly values the strict adherence to the Hanafi school of jurisprudence, also known as Taqlid. Deobandi scholars view Taqlid as a crucial means of ensuring the proper interpretation and application of Islamic law, especially for individuals without the necessary knowledge and expertise to engage in Ijtihad. However, Ijtihad is also recognized as necessary for the evolution of Islamic law, but it should be approached with caution and respect for Islamic scholarship traditions. Darul Uloom Deoband established the first Department of Fatwa, or Darul Ifta, in 1892, followed by other Deobandi madrasas and organizations such as the Islamic Fiqh Academy (India), which constitute the bedrock for the development of the Deobandi fiqh. Rashid Ahmad Gangohi is considered the founder of Deobandi fiqh, with Ashraf Ali Thanwi and Aziz-ul-Rahman Usmani regarded as key figures. The earliest text of Deobandi fiqh is &quot;Fatawa-e-Rashidiya&quot;, with other important texts including &quot;Imdad-ul-Fatawa&quot; and &quot;Fatawa Darul Uloom Deoband&quot;. Deobandi fiqh plays a vital role in Afghanistan&#x27;s judiciary system, with Taqi Usmani and Khalid Saifullah Rahmani recognized as prominent contemporary faqihs of the Deobandi school. Digital initiatives such as Darulifta-Deoband.com and Askimam demonstrate the digitization of Deobandi fiqh. A significant fatwa in Deobandi fiqh is the &quot;Fatwa of Peace for Humanity&quot;, issued by Farid Uddin Masood in 2016, endorsed by over 100,000 Islamic scholars from Bangladesh, declaring terrorism as haram or forbidden, based on Islamic scripture and tradition.

== Politics ==
=== Deobandi jihadism ===

Deobandi jihadism pertains to a militant interpretation of Islam that draws upon the teachings of the Deobandi movement. The Deobandi movement underwent three waves of armed conflict. The first wave resulted in the establishment of an Islamic territory centered on Thana Bhawan by the movement&#x27;s elders during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, prior to the founding of Darul Uloom Deoband. Imdadullah Muhajir Makki served as the Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin of this Islamic territory, Rashid Ahmad Gangohi as the Chief justice, and Muhammad Qasim Nanautavi as the Commander-in-chief. However, following the British victory over the Deobandi forces in the Battle of Shamli, the territory fell. After the establishment of Darul Uloom Deoband, Mahmud Hasan Deobandi initiated the second wave. He attempted to mobilize an armed resistance against the British through various initiatives, including the formation of the Samratut Tarbiat. When the British uncovered his Silk Letter Movement, they arrested him and held him captive in Malta. Following his release, he and his followers entered mainstream politics and actively participated in the democratic process. In the late 1970s, the Pakistan–Afghan border became the epicenter of the Deobandi jihadist movement&#x27;s third wave, which was fueled by the Soviet–Afghan War. Under the auspices of President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, its expansion occurred through various madrasas, such as Darul Uloom Haqqania and Jamia Uloom-ul-Islamia, with political support provided by Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (S). Trained militants from the Pakistan–Afghan border participated in the Afghan jihad and later formed various organizations, including the Taliban. The most prominent example of Deobandi jihadism is the Taliban, who established Islamic rule in Afghanistan. Sami-ul-Haq, the head of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (S), is regarded as the &quot;father of the Taliban.&quot;

==Organizations==
===Jamiat Ulema-I-Hind===

Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind is one of the leading Deobandi organizations in India. It was founded in British India in 1919 by Ahmad Saeed Dehlavi, Sanaullah Amritsari and several other scholars including Kifayatullah Dehlawi who was elected its first interim president. The Jamiat has propounded a theological basis for its nationalistic philosophy. Their thesis is that Muslims and non-Muslims have entered upon a mutual contract in India since independence, to establish a secular state. The Constitution of India represents this contract.

===Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam===
Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) is a Deobandi organization, part of the Deobandi movement. The JUI formed when members broke from the Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind in 1945 after that organization backed the Indian National Congress against the Muslim League&#x27;s lobby for a separate Pakistan. The first president of the JUI was Shabbir Ahmad Usmani.

===Majlis-e-Ahrar-e-Islam===
Majlis-e-Ahrar-e-Islam (), also known in short as Ahrar, was a conservative Deobandi political party in the Indian subcontinent during the British Raj (prior to the independence of Pakistan) founded 29 December 1929 at Lahore. Chaudhry Afzal Haq, Syed Ata Ullah Shah Bukhari, Habib-ur-Rehman Ludhianvi, Mazhar Ali Azhar, Zafar Ali Khan and Dawood Ghaznavi were the founders of the party. The Ahrar was composed of Indian Muslims disillusioned by the Khilafat Movement, which cleaved closer to the Congress Party. The party was associated with opposition to Muhammad Ali Jinnah and against establishment of an independent Pakistan as well as criticism of the Ahmadiyya movement. After the independence of Pakistan in 1947, Majlis-e-Ahrar divided in two parts. Now, Majlis-e-Ahrar-e-Islam is working for the sake of Muhammad, nifaaz Hakomat-e-illahiyya and Khidmat-e-Khalq. In Pakistan, Ahrar secretariat is in Lahore and in India it is based in Ludhiana.

=== Tablighi Jamaat ===
Tablighi Jamaat, a non-political Deobandi missionary organisation, began as an offshoot of the Deobandi movement. Its inception is believed to be a response to Hindu reform movements, which were considered a threat to vulnerable and non-practising Deobandi Muslims. It gradually expanded from a local to a national organisation, and finally to a transnational movement with followers in over 200 countries. Although its beginnings were from the Deobandi movement, it has now established an independent identity though it still maintains close ties with Deobandi ulema in many countries with large South Asian Muslim populations such as the UK.

===Associated militant organizations===

====Lashkar-e-Jhangvi====
Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LJ) (Army of Jhangvi) was a Deobandi militant organization. Formed in 1996, it operated in Pakistan as an offshoot of Sipah-e-Sahaba (SSP). Riaz Basra broke away from the SSP over differences with his seniors. The group, now practically defunct since the unsuccessful Operation Zarb-e-Azab, is considered a terrorist group by Pakistan and the United States, It was involved in attacks on civilians and protectors of them. Lashkar-e-Jhangvi is predominantly Punjabi. The group has been labelled by intelligence officials in Pakistan as a major security threat.

====Taliban====
The Taliban (&quot;students&quot;), alternative spelling Taleban, is an Islamic fundamentalist political and militant movement in Afghanistan. It spread into Afghanistan and formed a government, ruling as the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan from September 1996 until December 2001, with Kandahar as the capital.
While in power, it enforced its strict interpretation of Sharia law. While many leading Muslims and Islamic scholars have been highly critical of the Taliban&#x27;s interpretations of Islamic law, the Darul Uloom Deoband has consistently supported the Taliban in Afghanistan, including their 2001 destruction of the Buddhas of Bamiyan, and the majority of the Taliban&#x27;s leaders were influenced by Deobandi fundamentalism. Pashtunwali, the Pashtun tribal code, also played a significant role in the Taliban&#x27;s legislation. The Taliban were condemned internationally for their brutal treatment of women.

====Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan====
Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (the TTP), alternatively referred to as the Pakistani Taliban, is an umbrella organization of various Islamist militant groups based in the northwestern Federally Administered Tribal Areas along the Afghan border in Pakistan. In December 2007 about 13 groups united under the leadership of Baitullah Mehsud to form the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan. Among the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan&#x27;s stated objectives are resistance against the Pakistani state, enforcement of their interpretation of sharia and a plan to unite against NATO-led forces in Afghanistan.

The TTP is not directly affiliated with the Afghan Taliban movement led by Mullah Omar, with both groups differing greatly in their histories, strategic goals and interests although they both share a primarily Deobandi interpretation of Islam and are predominantly Pashtun.

====Sipah-e-Sahaba====
Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan (SSP) is a banned Pakistani militant organization, and a formerly registered Pakistani political party. Established in the early 1980s in Jhang by the militant leader Haq Nawaz Jhangvi, its stated goal is primarily to deter major Shiite influence in Pakistan in the wake of the Iranian Revolution. The organization was banned by President Pervez Musharraf in 2002 as being a terrorist group under the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1997.
In October 2000 Masood Azhar, another militant leader, and founder of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), was quoted as saying that &quot;Sipah-e-Sahaba stands shoulder to shoulder with Jaish-e-Muhammad in Jehad.&quot; A leaked U.S. diplomatic cable described JeM as &quot;another SSP breakaway Deobandi organization.&quot;

==Institutions==

<doc id="65173" wikidata="Q229556" url="?curid=65173" title="Patty Hearst">
<text>Patricia Campbell Hearst (born February 20, 1954) is an American actress and member of the Hearst family. She is the granddaughter of American publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst. 

She first became known for the events following her 1974 kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army. She was found and arrested 19 months after being abducted, by which time she was a fugitive wanted for serious crimes committed with members of the group. She was held in custody, and there was speculation before trial that her family&#x27;s resources would enable her to avoid time in prison.

At her trial, the prosecution suggested that Hearst had joined the Symbionese Liberation Army of her own volition. However, she testified that she had been raped and threatened with death while held captive. In 1976, she was convicted for the crime of bank robbery and sentenced to 35 years in prison, later reduced to seven years. Her sentence was commuted by President Jimmy Carter, and she was later pardoned by President Bill Clinton.

In the 1990s, she began acting in films and television after being approached by film director John Waters.

==Early life ==
Hearst, who prefers to be called Patricia rather than Patty, was born on February 20, 1954, in San Francisco, California, the third of five daughters of Randolph Apperson Hearst and Catherine Wood Campbell. She was raised primarily in Hillsborough and attended the private Crystal Springs School for Girls there, Sacred Heart in Atherton, and the Santa Catalina School in Monterey. She attended Menlo College in Atherton, California before transferring to the University of California, Berkeley. 

Hearst&#x27;s grandfather William Randolph Hearst created the largest newspaper, magazine, newsreel and film business in the world. Her great-grandmother was philanthropist Phoebe Hearst. The family wielded immense political influence and had opposed organized labor, gold mine workers&#x27; interests, and communism since before World War II. Hearst&#x27;s father was among a number of heirs to the family fortune and did not control the Hearst interests. Her parents had not considered it necessary to take preventive measures to ensure their children&#x27;s personal security. At the time of her abduction, Hearst was a sophomore at Berkeley studying art history. She lived with her fiancé Steven Weed in an apartment in Berkeley.

==Symbionese Liberation Army==
===Kidnapping===
On February 4, 1974, 19-year-old Hearst was kidnapped from her Berkeley apartment. A small urban guerrilla left-wing group called the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) claimed responsibility for the abduction. Hearst&#x27;s kidnapping was partly opportunistic, as she resided near the SLA hideout. According to testimony at trial, the group&#x27;s main intention was to leverage the Hearst family&#x27;s political influence to free SLA members Russ Little and Joe Remiro, who had been arrested for the November 1973 murder of Marcus Foster, superintendent of Oakland public schools.

After the state refused to free the men, the SLA demanded that Hearst&#x27;s family distribute $70 worth of food to every needy Californian, an operation that would cost an estimated $400 million. In response, Hearst&#x27;s father obtained a loan and arranged the immediate donation of $2 million worth of food to the poor of the Bay Area for one year in a project called People in Need. After the distribution descended into chaos, the SLA refused to release Hearst.

According to Hearst&#x27;s testimony at her 1976 trial, she was held for a week in a closet, blindfolded and with her hands tied. During this time, SLA founder Cinque (Donald DeFreeze) repeatedly threatened her with death. She was allowed to leave the closet for meals, still blindfolded, and began to participate in the group&#x27;s political discussions. She was given a flashlight for reading and SLA political tracts to memorize. Hearst was confined in the closet for weeks. She said, &quot;DeFreeze told me that the war council had decided or was thinking about killing me or me staying with them, and that I better start thinking about that as a possibility. ... I accommodated my thoughts to coincide with theirs.&quot; In an April 1974 account, Hearst claimed that she had been offered the choice of being released or joining the SLA.

When asked for her decision, Hearst elected to remain and fight with the SLA. The blindfold was removed, allowing her to see her captors for the first time. After this, she was given daily lessons on her duties, especially weapon drills. Angela Atwood told Hearst that the others wanted Hearst to share in the sexual freedom among the unit. Hearst later claimed to have been raped by William &quot;Willie&quot; Wolfe and DeFreeze.

===Bank robbery===
On April 3, 1974, two months after she had been abducted, Hearst announced on an audiotape released to the media that she had joined the SLA and adopted the name Tania, a tribute to Che Guevara&#x27;s comrade Haydée Tamara Bunke Bider.
On April 15, 1974, Hearst was recorded on surveillance video wielding an M1 carbine while robbing the Sunset District branch of the Hibernia Bank at 1450 Noriega Street in San Francisco. Hearst, identified under her pseudonym of &quot;Tania&quot;, yelled, &quot;I&#x27;m Tania. Up, up, up against the wall, motherfuckers!&quot; Two men entered the bank while the robbery was occurring and were shot and wounded by the SLA. According to testimony at her trial, a witness thought that Hearst had been several paces behind the others when running to the getaway car.

Attorney General William B. Saxbe said that Hearst was a &quot;common criminal&quot; and &quot;not a reluctant participant&quot; in the bank robbery. James L. Browning Jr. said that her participation in the robbery may have been voluntary, contrasting with an earlier comment in which he said that she might have been coerced into taking part. The FBI agent heading the investigation said that SLA members were photographed pointing guns at Hearst during the robbery. A grand jury indicted her in June 1974 for the robbery.

===Rescue of Harris===
On May 16, 1974, the manager at Mel&#x27;s Sporting Goods in Inglewood, California, observed a minor theft by William Harris, who had been shopping with his wife Emily while Hearst waited across the road in a van. The manager and an employee followed Harris out and confronted him. There was a scuffle and the manager restrained Harris, when a pistol fell out of Harris&#x27;s waistband. Hearst discharged the entire magazine of an automatic carbine into the overhead storefront, causing the manager to dive behind a lightpost. He tried to shoot back, but Hearst began aiming closer.

===Fugitive===
Hearst and the Harris couple hijacked two cars and abducted the owners. One was a young man who found Hearst so personable that he was reluctant to report the incident. He testified at the trial to her discussing the effectiveness of cyanide-tipped bullets and repeatedly asking if he was okay. Police had surrounded the main base of the SLA in Los Angeles before these three returned, so they hid elsewhere.

The six SLA members inside the hideout died. There was an hourslong gunfight with police, and two members were fatally shot; a fire broke out in the house, in which the remainder died, but DeFreeze first killed himself by gunshot. It was initially thought that Hearst had also died during this confrontation. Warrants were issued for the arrest of Hearst and the Harrises for several , including two counts of kidnapping.

Emily Harris went to a Berkeley rally to commemorate the deaths of Angela Atwood, Soltysik, DeFreeze, and other founding members of the SLA who had died in Los Angeles during the police siege. Harris recognized Atwood&#x27;s acquaintance Kathy Soliah among the radicals whom she had known from civil rights groups. Soliah introduced the three fugitives to Jack Scott, an athletics reformer and radical, and he agreed to provide them help and money.

===Involvement in later SLA crimes===
Hearst helped make improvised explosive devices. These were used in two unsuccessful attempts to kill police officers during August 1975; one of the devices failed to detonate.

Marked money found in the apartment when she was arrested linked Hearst to the SLA armed robbery of Crocker National Bank in Carmichael, California; she was the getaway car driver for the robbery. Myrna Opsahl, a mother of four who was at the bank making a deposit, was shot dead by a masked Emily Harris. Hearst was potentially at risk for felony murder charges and could testify as a witness against Harris for a capital offense.

==Legal consequences==

On September 18, 1975, Hearst was arrested in a San Francisco apartment with Wendy Yoshimura, another SLA member, by San Francisco Police Inspector Timothy F. Casey and his partner, Police Officer Laurence R. Pasero, and FBI Special Agent Thomas J. Padden and his partners, FBI agents Jason Moulton, Frank Doyle, Jr., Larry Lawler, Monte Hall, Dick Vitamonte, Leo Brenneissen, and Ray Campos. While being booked into jail, Hearst listed her occupation as &quot;Urban Guerilla&quot;. She asked her attorney to relay the following message: &quot;Tell everybody that I&#x27;m smiling, that I feel free and strong and I send my greetings and love to all the sisters and brothers out there.&quot;

===Brainwashing claims===
At the time of her arrest, Hearst&#x27;s weight had dropped to 87 pounds (40 kg), and she was described by psychologist Margaret Singer in October 1975 as &quot;a low-IQ, low-affect zombie&quot;. Shortly after her arrest, doctors recorded signs of trauma: her IQ was measured as 112, whereas it had previously been 130; there were huge gaps in her memory regarding her pre-Tania life; she was smoking heavily and had nightmares. Without a mental illness or defect, a person is considered to be fully responsible for any criminal action not done under duress, which is defined as a clear and present threat of death or serious injury. For Hearst to secure an acquittal on the grounds of having been brainwashed would have been completely unprecedented.

Psychiatrist Louis Jolyon West, a professor at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), was appointed by the court in his capacity as a brainwashing expert and worked without a fee. After the trial, he wrote a newspaper article asking President Carter to release Hearst from prison.
Hearst wrote in her memoir, &quot;Every Secret Thing&quot; (1982), &quot;I spent fifteen hours going over my SLA experiences with Robert Jay Lifton of Yale University. Lifton, author of several books on coercive persuasion and thought reform, [...] pronounced me a &#x27;classic case&#x27; which met all the psychological criteria of a coerced prisoner of war. [...] If I had reacted differently, that would have been suspect, he said.&quot;
After some weeks in custody, Hearst repudiated her SLA allegiance. Her first lawyer, Terence Hallinan, had advised Hearst not to talk to anyone, including psychiatrists. He advocated a defense of involuntary intoxication: that the SLA had given her drugs that affected her judgment and recollection.

He was replaced by attorney F. Lee Bailey, who asserted a defense of coercion or duress affecting intent at the time of the offense. This was similar to the brainwashing defense which Hallinan had warned was not a defense in law. Hearst gave long interviews to various psychiatrists.

===Trial===
Hearst alone was arraigned for the Hibernia Bank robbery; the trial commenced on January 15, 1976. Judge Oliver Jesse Carter ruled that Hearst&#x27;s taped and written statements after the bank robbery, while she was a fugitive with the SLA members, were voluntary. He did not allow expert testimony that stylistic analysis indicated the &quot;Tania&quot; statements and writing were not wholly composed by Hearst. He permitted the prosecution to introduce statements and actions Hearst made long after the Hibernia robbery, as evidence of her state of mind at the time of the robbery. Judge Carter also allowed into evidence a recording made by jail authorities of a friend&#x27;s jail visit with Hearst, in which Hearst used profanities and spoke of her radical and feminist beliefs, but he did not allow tapes of psychiatrist Louis Jolyon West&#x27;s interviews of Hearst to be heard by the jury. Judge Carter was described as &quot;resting his eyes&quot; during testimony favorable to the defense by West and others.

According to Hearst&#x27;s testimony, her captors had demanded she appear enthusiastic during the robbery and warned she would pay with her life for any mistake. Her defense lawyer F. Lee Bailey provided photographs showing that SLA members, including Camilla Hall, had pointed guns at Hearst during the robbery. In reference to the shooting at Mel&#x27;s Sporting Goods Store and her decision to not escape, Hearst testified that she was instructed throughout her captivity on what to do in an emergency. She said one class in particular had a situation similar to the store manager&#x27;s detention of the Harrises. Hearst testified that &quot;when it happened I didn&#x27;t even think. I just did it, and if I had not done it and if they had been able to get away they would have killed me.&quot;

Testifying for the prosecution, Dr. Harry Kozol said Hearst had been &quot;a rebel in search of a cause&quot;, and her participation in the Hibernia robbery had been &quot;an act of free will.&quot; Prosecutor James L. Browning Jr. asked the other psychiatrist testifying for the prosecution, Dr. Joel Fort, if Hearst was in fear of death or great bodily injury during the robbery, to which he answered, &quot;No&quot;. Bailey angrily objected. Fort assessed Hearst as amoral, and said she had voluntarily had sex with Wolfe and DeFreeze, which Hearst denied both in court and outside. Prosecutor Browning tried to show that writings by Hearst indicated her testimony had misrepresented her interactions with Wolfe. She said she had been writing the SLA version of events, and had been punched in the face by William Harris when she refused to be more effusive about what she regarded as sexual abuse by Wolfe. Judge Carter allowed testimony from the prosecution psychiatrists about Hearst&#x27;s early sexual experiences, although these had occurred years before her kidnapping and the bank robbery.

In court, Hearst made a poor impression and appeared lethargic. An Associated Press report attributed this state to drugs she was given by jail doctors. Bailey was strongly criticized for his decision to put Hearst on the stand, then having her repeatedly decline to answer questions. According to Alan Dershowitz, Bailey was wrong-footed by the judge, who had appeared to indicate she would have Fifth Amendment privilege: the jury would not be present for some of her testimony, or would be instructed not to draw inferences, on matters subsequent to the Hibernian Bank charges for which she was being tried, but he changed his mind.

After a few months, Hearst provided information to the authorities, not under oath (sworn testimony could have been used to convict her) of SLA activities. A bomb exploded at Hearst Castle in February 1976. After Hearst testified that Wolfe had raped her, Emily Harris gave a magazine interview from jail alleging that Hearst&#x27;s keeping a trinket given to her by Wolfe was an indication that she had been in a romantic relationship with him. Hearst said she had kept the stone carving because she thought it was a Pre-Columbian artifact of archeological significance. The prosecutor James L. Browning Jr. used Harris&#x27;s interpretation of the item. Some jurors later said they regarded the carving, which Browning waved in front of them, as powerful evidence that Hearst was lying.

===Closing arguments===
In his closing argument, prosecutor Browning suggested that Hearst had taken part in the bank robbery without coercion. Browning, who later became a judge, also suggested to the jury that as the female SLA members were feminists, they would not have allowed Hearst to be raped.

In her autobiography, Hearst expressed disappointment with what she saw as Bailey&#x27;s lack of focus in the crucial end stage of her trial. She described him as having the appearance of someone with a hangover, and spilling water down the front of his pants while making a &quot;disjointed&quot; closing argument. Bailey&#x27;s final statement to the court was, &quot;But simple application of the rules, I think, will yield one decent result, and, that is, there is not anything close to proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Patty Hearst wanted to be a bank robber. What you know, and you know in your hearts to be true is beyond dispute. There was talk about her dying, and she wanted to survive.&quot;

===Conviction and sentencing===

On March 20, 1976, Hearst was convicted of bank robbery and using a firearm during the commission of a felony. She was given the maximum sentence possible of 35 years&#x27; imprisonment, pending a reduction at final sentence hearing, which Carter declined to specify.

Because Judge Carter had died, Judge William H. Orrick Jr. determined Hearst&#x27;s sentence. He gave her seven years&#x27; imprisonment, commenting that &quot;rebellious young people who, for whatever reason become revolutionaries, and voluntarily commit criminal acts will be punished&quot;.

==Prison life==

Hearst was imprisoned at the Federal Correctional Institution, Dublin (California). She suffered a collapsed lung in prison, the beginning of a series of medical problems, and she underwent emergency surgery. This prevented her from appearing to testify against the Harrises on 11 charges, including robbery, kidnapping, and assault; she was also arraigned for those charges. She was held in solitary confinement for security reasons; she was granted bail for an appeal hearing in November 1976 on the condition that she was protected on bond. Her father hired dozens of bodyguards.

Superior Court judge Talbot Callister gave her probation on the sporting goods store charge when she pleaded no contest, saying that he believed that she had been subject to coercion amounting to torture. California Attorney General Evelle J. Younger said that, if there was a double standard for the wealthy, it was the opposite of what was generally believed and that Hearst had received a stiffer sentence than a person of lesser means might have. He said that she had no legal brainwashing defense, but pointed out that the events had started with her being kidnapped.

Hearst&#x27;s bail was revoked in May 1978 when appeals failed, and the Supreme Court declined to hear her case. The prison took no special security measures for her safety until she found a dead rat on her bunk on the day when William and Emily Harris were arraigned for her abduction. The Harrises were convicted on a simple kidnapping charge, as opposed to the more serious kidnapping for ransom or kidnapping with bodily injury, and they were released after serving a total of eight years each.

Representative Leo Ryan was collecting signatures on a petition for Hearst&#x27;s release several weeks before he was murdered while visiting the Jonestown settlement in Guyana. Actor John Wayne spoke after the Jonestown cult deaths, stating that people had accepted that Jim Jones had brainwashed 900 individuals into mass suicide but would not accept that the Symbionese Liberation Army could have brainwashed a kidnapped teenage girl.

===Commutation, release, and pardon===
President Jimmy Carter commuted Hearst&#x27;s federal sentence to the 22 months served, freeing her eight months before she was eligible for her first parole hearing. Her release (on February 1, 1979) was under stringent conditions, and she remained on probation for the state sentence on the sporting goods store plea. She recovered full civil rights when President Bill Clinton granted her a pardon on January 20, 2001, his last day in office.

==Life after release==

Two months after her release from prison, Hearst married Bernard Lee Shaw (1945–2013), a policeman who was part of her security detail during her time on bail. They had two children, Gillian and Lydia Hearst-Shaw. Hearst became involved in a foundation helping children with AIDS, and was active in other charities and fund-raising activities.

===Media and other activities===
Hearst published the memoir &quot;Every Secret Thing&quot;, co-written with Alvin Moscow, in 1981. Her accounts resulted in authorities considering bringing new charges against her. She was interviewed in 2009 on NBC and said that the prosecutor had suggested that she had been in a consensual relationship with Wolfe. She described that as &quot;outrageous&quot; and an insult to rape victims.

Hearst produced a special for the Travel Channel titled &quot;Secrets of San Simeon with Patricia Hearst&quot;, in which she took viewers inside her grandfather&#x27;s mansion Hearst Castle, providing unprecedented access to the property. She collaborated with Cordelia Frances Biddle on writing the novel &quot;Murder at San Simeon&quot; (Scribner, 1996), based upon the death of Thomas H. Ince on her grandfather&#x27;s yacht.

She has appeared in feature films for director John Waters, who cast her in &quot;Cry-Baby&quot; (1990), &quot;Serial Mom&quot; (1994), &quot;Pecker&quot; (1998), &quot;Cecil B. DeMented&quot; (2000) and &quot;A Dirty Shame&quot; (2004). Hearst also made a cameo in Pauly Shore&#x27;s film &quot;Bio-Dome&quot; (1996) and had a small role in the 2004 film &quot;Second Best&quot;. She was also a producer on the film &quot;Pottersville&quot; and made an appearance in the 2000 documentary, &quot;Pie in the Sky: The Brigid Berlin Story&quot;.

Her television acting roles include episodes of &quot;The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete&quot;, &quot;Boston Common&quot;, &quot;Son of the Beach&quot; and &quot;Tripping the Rift&quot;. She was also a guest caller on the TV series &quot;Frasier&quot; on season 1 episode 23 &quot;Frasier Crane&#x27;s Day Off&quot; (1994), as Janice. She also appeared in the episode &quot;Lord of the Pi&#x27;s&quot; in season 3 of &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;. The character was the heiress of a fictionalized Hearst family, loosely based on aspects of her life.

Hearst has participated with her dogs in dog shows, and her Shih Tzu Rocket won the &quot;Toy&quot; group at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show at Madison Square Garden on February 16, 2015. At the 2017 show, Hearst&#x27;s French bulldog Tuggy won Best of Breed, and Rubi won Best of Opposite Sex.

<doc id="65174" wikidata="Q7304" url="?curid=65174" title="Gustav Mahler">
<text>Gustav Mahler (; 7 July 1860 – 18 May 1911) was an Austro-Bohemian Romantic composer, and one of the leading conductors of his generation. As a composer he acted as a bridge between the 19th-century Austro-German tradition and the modernism of the early 20th century. While in his lifetime his status as a conductor was established beyond question, his own music gained wide popularity only after periods of relative neglect, which included a ban on its performance in much of Europe during the Nazi era. After 1945 his compositions were rediscovered by a new generation of listeners; Mahler then became one of the most frequently performed and recorded of all composers, a position he has sustained into the 21st century.

Born in Bohemia (then part of the Austrian Empire) to Jewish parents of humble origins, the German-speaking Mahler displayed his musical gifts at an early age. After graduating from the Vienna Conservatory in 1878, he held a succession of conducting posts of rising importance in the opera houses of Europe, culminating in his appointment in 1897 as director of the Vienna Court Opera (Hofoper). During his ten years in Vienna, Mahler—who had converted to Catholicism to secure the post—experienced regular opposition and hostility from the anti-Semitic press. Nevertheless, his innovative productions and insistence on the highest performance standards ensured his reputation as one of the greatest of opera conductors, particularly as an interpreter of the stage works of Wagner, Mozart, and Tchaikovsky. Late in his life he was briefly director of New York&#x27;s Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic.

Mahler&#x27;s &quot;œuvre&quot; is relatively limited; for much of his life composing was necessarily a part-time activity while he earned his living as a conductor. Aside from early works such as a movement from a piano quartet composed when he was a student in Vienna, Mahler&#x27;s works are generally designed for large orchestral forces, symphonic choruses and operatic soloists. These works were frequently controversial when first performed, and several were slow to receive critical and popular approval; exceptions included his Second Symphony, and the triumphant premiere of his Eighth Symphony in 1910. Some of Mahler&#x27;s immediate musical successors included the composers of the Second Viennese School, notably Arnold Schoenberg, Alban Berg and Anton Webern. Dmitri Shostakovich and Benjamin Britten are among later 20th-century composers who admired and were influenced by Mahler. The International Gustav Mahler Society was established in 1955 to honour the composer&#x27;s life and achievements.

==Biography==

===Early life===

====Family background====

The Mahler family came from eastern Bohemia, now in the Czech Republic, and were of humble circumstances—the composer&#x27;s grandmother had been a street pedlar. Bohemia was then part of the Austrian Empire; the Mahler family belonged to a German-speaking minority among Bohemians, and was also Jewish. From this background the future composer developed early on a permanent sense of exile, &quot;always an intruder, never welcomed&quot;. The pedlar&#x27;s son Bernhard Mahler, the composer&#x27;s father, elevated himself to the ranks of the petite bourgeoisie by becoming a coachman and later an innkeeper. He bought a modest house in the village of Kaliště (), and in 1857 married Marie Herrmann, the 19-year-old daughter of a local soap manufacturer. In the following year Marie gave birth to the first of the couple&#x27;s 14 children, a son named Isidor, who died in infancy. Two years later, on 1860, their second son, Gustav, was born.

====Childhood====
In December 1860, Bernhard Mahler moved with his wife and infant son to the city of Jihlava (), where Bernhard built up a successful distillery and tavern business. The family grew rapidly, but of the 12 children born to the family in the city, only six survived infancy. Jihlava was then a thriving commercial city of 20,000 people, in which Gustav was introduced to music through the street songs of the day, through dance tunes, folk melodies and the trumpet calls and marches of the local military band. All of these elements would later contribute to his mature musical vocabulary.

When he was four years old, Gustav discovered his grandparents&#x27; piano and took to it immediately. He developed his performing skills sufficiently to be considered a local and gave his first public performance at the town theatre when he was ten years old. Although Gustav loved making music, his school reports from the Jihlava portrayed him as absent-minded and unreliable in academic work. In 1871, in the hope of improving the boy&#x27;s results, his father sent him to the New Town Gymnasium in Prague, but Gustav was unhappy there and soon returned to Jihlava. On 13 April 1875 he suffered a bitter personal loss when his younger brother Ernst (b. 18 March 1862) died after a long illness. Mahler sought to express his feelings in music: with the help of a friend, Josef Steiner, he began work on an opera, (&quot;Duke Ernest of Swabia&quot;), as a memorial to his lost brother. Neither the music nor the libretto of this work has survived.

====Student days====
Bernhard Mahler supported his son&#x27;s ambitions for a music career, and agreed that the boy should try for a place at the Vienna Conservatory. The young Mahler was auditioned by the renowned pianist Julius Epstein, and accepted for 1875–76. He made good progress in his piano studies with Epstein and won prizes at the end of each of his first two years. For his final year, 1877–78, he concentrated on composition and harmony under Robert Fuchs and Franz Krenn. Few of Mahler&#x27;s student compositions have survived; most were abandoned when he became dissatisfied with them. He destroyed a symphonic movement prepared for an end-of-term competition, after its scornful rejection by the autocratic director Joseph Hellmesberger on the grounds of copying errors. Mahler may have gained his first conducting experience with the Conservatory&#x27;s student orchestra, in rehearsals and performances, although it appears that his main role in this orchestra was as a percussionist.
Among Mahler&#x27;s fellow students at the Conservatory was the future song composer Hugo Wolf, with whom he formed a close friendship. Wolf was unable to submit to the strict disciplines of the Conservatory and was expelled. Mahler, while sometimes rebellious, avoided the same fate only by writing a penitent letter to Hellmesberger. He attended occasional lectures by Anton Bruckner and, though never formally his pupil, was influenced by him. On 16 December 1877, he attended the disastrous premiere of Bruckner&#x27;s Third Symphony, at which the composer was shouted down, and most of the audience walked out. Mahler and other sympathetic students later prepared a piano version of the symphony, which they presented to Bruckner. Along with many music students of his generation, Mahler fell under the spell of Richard Wagner, though his chief interest was the sound of the music rather than the staging. It is not known whether he saw any of Wagner&#x27;s operas during his student years.

Mahler left the conservatory in 1878 with a diploma but without the silver medal given for outstanding achievement. He then enrolled in the University of Vienna (he had, at his father&#x27;s insistence, sat and with difficulty passed the , a highly demanding final exam at a , which was a precondition for university studies) and followed courses which reflected his developing interests in literature and philosophy. After leaving the university in 1879, Mahler made some money as a piano teacher, continued to compose, and in 1880 finished a dramatic cantata, (&quot;The Song of Lamentation&quot;). This, his first substantial composition, shows traces of Wagnerian and Brucknerian influences, yet includes many musical elements which musicologist Deryck Cooke describes as &quot;pure Mahler&quot;. Its first performance was delayed until 1901, when it was presented in a revised, shortened form.

Mahler developed interests in German philosophy, and was introduced by his friend Siegfried Lipiner to the works of Arthur Schopenhauer, Friedrich Nietzsche, Gustav Fechner and Hermann Lotze. These thinkers continued to influence Mahler and his music long after his student days were over. Mahler&#x27;s biographer Jonathan Carr says that the composer&#x27;s head was &quot;not only full of the sound of Bohemian bands, trumpet calls and marches, Bruckner chorales and Schubert sonatas. It was also throbbing with the problems of philosophy and metaphysics he had thrashed out, above all, with Lipiner&quot;.

===Early conducting career 1880–1888===

====First appointments====
From June to August 1880, Mahler took his first professional conducting job, in a small wooden theatre in the spa town of Bad Hall, south of Linz. The repertory was exclusively operetta; it was, in Carr&#x27;s words &quot;a dismal little job&quot;, which Mahler accepted only after Julius Epstein told him he would soon work his way up. In 1881, he was engaged for six months (September to April) at the Landestheater in Laibach (now Ljubljana, in Slovenia), where the small but resourceful company was prepared to attempt more ambitious works. Here, Mahler conducted his first full-scale opera, Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, one of 10 operas and a number of operettas that he presented during his time in Laibach. After completing this engagement, Mahler returned to Vienna and worked part-time as chorus-master at the Vienna Carltheater.

From the beginning of January 1883, Mahler became conductor at the Royal Municipal Theatre in Olmütz (now Olomouc) in Moravia. He later wrote: &quot;From the moment I crossed the threshold of the Olmütz theatre I felt like one awaiting the wrath of God.&quot; Despite poor relations with the orchestra, Mahler brought nine operas to the theatre, including Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;, and won over the press that had initially been sceptical of him. After a week&#x27;s trial at the Royal Theatre in the Hessian town of Kassel, Mahler became the theatre&#x27;s &quot;Musical and Choral Director&quot; from August 1883. The title concealed the reality that Mahler was subordinate to the theatre&#x27;s Kapellmeister, Wilhelm Treiber, who disliked him (and vice versa) and set out to make his life miserable. Despite the unpleasant atmosphere, Mahler had moments of success at Kassel. He directed a performance of his favourite opera, Weber&#x27;s , and 25 other operas. On 23 June 1884, he conducted his own incidental music to Joseph Victor von Scheffel&#x27;s play (&quot;The Trumpeter of Säckingen&quot;), the first professional public performance of a Mahler work. An ardent, but ultimately unfulfilled, love affair with soprano Johanna Richter led Mahler to write a series of love poems which became the text of his song cycle (&quot;Songs of a Wayfarer&quot;).

In January 1884, the distinguished conductor Hans von Bülow brought the Meiningen Court Orchestra to Kassel and gave two concerts. Hoping to escape from his job in the theatre, Mahler unsuccessfully sought a post as Bülow&#x27;s permanent assistant. However, in the following year his efforts to find new employment resulted in a six-year contract with the prestigious Leipzig Opera, to begin in August 1886. Unwilling to remain in Kassel for another year, Mahler resigned on 22 June 1885, and applied for, and through good fortune was offered, a standby appointment as conductor at the Royal in Prague by the theatre&#x27;s newly appointed director, the famous Angelo Neumann.

====Prague and Leipzig====

In Prague, the emergence of the Czech National Revival had increased the popularity and importance of the new Czech National Theatre, and had led to a downturn in the &#x27;s fortunes. Mahler&#x27;s task was to help arrest this decline by offering high-quality productions of German opera. He enjoyed early success presenting works by Mozart and Wagner, composers with whom he would be particularly associated for the rest of his career, but his individualistic and increasingly autocratic conducting style led to friction, and a falling out with his more experienced fellow-conductor, Ludwig Slansky. During his 12 months in Prague he conducted 68 performances of 14 operas (12 titles were new in his repertory), and he also performed Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony for the first time in his life. By the end of the season, in July 1886, Mahler left Prague to take up his post at the in Leipzig, where rivalry with his senior colleague Arthur Nikisch began almost at once. This conflict was primarily over how the two should share conducting duties for the theatre&#x27;s new production of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Ring&quot; cycle. Nikisch&#x27;s illness, from February to April 1887, meant that Mahler took charge of the whole cycle (except ), and scored a resounding public success. This did not, however, win him popularity with the orchestra, who resented his dictatorial manner and heavy rehearsal schedules.

In Leipzig, Mahler befriended Captain (1849–1897), grandson of the composer, and agreed to prepare a performing version of Carl Maria von Weber&#x27;s unfinished opera (&quot;The Three Pintos&quot;). Mahler transcribed and orchestrated the existing musical sketches, used parts of other Weber works, and added some composition of his own. The premiere at the Stadttheater, on 20 January 1888, was an important occasion at which several heads of various German opera houses were present. (The Russian composer Tchaikovsky attended the third performance on 29 January.) The work was well-received; its success did much to raise Mahler&#x27;s public profile, and brought him financial rewards. Mahler&#x27;s involvement with the Weber family was complicated by Mahler&#x27;s alleged romantic attachment to Carl von Weber&#x27;s wife Marion Mathilde (1857–1931) which, though intense on both sides – so it was rumoured by for example English composer Ethel Smyth – ultimately came to nothing. In February and March 1888 Mahler sketched and completed his First Symphony, then in five movements. At around the same time Mahler discovered the German folk-poem collection (&quot;The Youth&#x27;s Magic Horn&quot;), which would dominate much of his compositional output for the following 12 years.

On 17 May 1888, Mahler suddenly resigned his Leipzig position after a dispute with the &#x27;s chief stage manager, Albert Goldberg. However, Mahler had secretly been invited by Angelo Neumann in Prague (and accepted the offer) to conduct the premiere there of &quot;his&quot; , and later also a production of by Peter Cornelius. This short stay (July to September) ended unhappily, with Mahler&#x27;s dismissal following his outburst during a rehearsal. However, through the efforts of an old Viennese friend, Guido Adler, and cellist David Popper, Mahler&#x27;s name went forward as a potential director of the Royal Hungarian Opera in Budapest. He was interviewed, made a good impression, and was offered and accepted (with some reluctance) the post from 1 October 1888.

====Apprentice composer====
In the early years of Mahler&#x27;s conducting career, composing was a spare time activity. Between his Laibach and Olmütz appointments he worked on settings of verses by Richard Leander and Tirso de Molina, later collected as Volume I of (&quot;Songs and Airs&quot;). Mahler&#x27;s first orchestral song cycle, , composed at Kassel, was based on his own verses, although the first poem, &quot;&quot; (&quot;When my love becomes a bride&quot;) closely follows the text of a poem. The melodies for the second and fourth songs of the cycle were incorporated into the First Symphony, which Mahler finished in 1888, at the height of his relationship with Marion von Weber. The intensity of Mahler&#x27;s feelings is reflected in the music, which originally was written as a five-movement symphonic poem with a descriptive programme. One of these movements, the &quot;Blumine&quot;, later discarded, was based on a passage from his earlier work . After completing the symphony, Mahler composed a 20-minute symphonic poem, &quot;Funeral Rites&quot;, which later became the first movement of his Second Symphony.

There has been frequent speculation about lost or destroyed works from Mahler&#x27;s early years. The Dutch conductor Willem Mengelberg believed that the First Symphony was too mature to be a first symphonic work, and must have had predecessors. In 1938, Mengelberg revealed the existence of the so-called &quot;Dresden archive&quot;, a series of manuscripts in the possession of the widowed Marion von Weber. According to the Mahler historian Donald Mitchell, it was highly likely that important Mahler manuscripts of early symphonic works had been held in Dresden; this archive, if it existed, was almost certainly destroyed in the bombing of Dresden in 1945.

===Budapest and Hamburg, 1888–1897===

====Royal Opera, Budapest====
On arriving in Budapest in October 1888, Mahler encountered a cultural conflict between conservative Hungarian nationalists who favoured a policy of Magyarisation, and progressives who wanted to maintain and develop the country&#x27;s Austro-German cultural traditions. In the opera house a dominant conservative caucus, led by the music director Sándor Erkel, had maintained a limited repertory of historical and folklore opera. By the time that Mahler began his duties, the progressive camp had gained ascendancy following the appointment of the liberal-minded Ferenc von Beniczky as intendant. Aware of the delicate situation, Mahler moved cautiously; he delayed his first appearance on the conductor&#x27;s stand until January 1889, when he conducted Hungarian-language performances of Wagner&#x27;s and to initial public acclaim. However, his early successes faded when plans to stage the remainder of the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle and other German operas were frustrated by a renascent conservative faction which favoured a more traditional &quot;Hungarian&quot; programme. In search of non-German operas to extend the repertory, Mahler visited in spring 1890 Italy where among the works he discovered was Mascagni&#x27;s recent sensation (Budapest premiere on 26 December 1890).

On 18 February 1889, Bernhard Mahler died; this was followed later in the year by the deaths both of Mahler&#x27;s sister Leopoldine (27 September) and his mother (11 October). From October 1889 Mahler took charge of his four younger brothers and sisters (Alois, Otto, Justine, and Emma). They were installed in a rented flat in Vienna. Mahler himself suffered poor health, with attacks of haemorrhoids and migraine and a recurrent septic throat. Shortly after these family and health setbacks the premiere of the First Symphony, in Budapest on 20 November 1889, was a disappointment. The critic August Beer&#x27;s lengthy newspaper review indicates that enthusiasm after the early movements degenerated into &quot;audible opposition&quot; after the Finale. Mahler was particularly distressed by the negative comments from his Vienna Conservatory contemporary, Viktor von Herzfeld, who had remarked that Mahler, like many conductors before him, had proved not to be a composer.

In 1891, Hungary&#x27;s move to the political right was reflected in the opera house when Beniczky on 1 February was replaced as intendant by Count Géza Zichy, a conservative aristocrat determined to assume artistic control over Mahler&#x27;s head. However, Mahler had foreseen that and had secretly been negotiating with Bernhard Pollini, the director of the Stadttheater Hamburg since summer and autumn of 1890, and a contract was finally signed in secrecy on 15 January 1891. Mahler more or less &quot;forced&quot; himself to be sacked from his Budapest post, and he succeeded on 14 March 1891. By his departure he received a large sum of indemnity. One of his final Budapest triumphs was a performance of Mozart&#x27;s (16 September 1890) which won him praise from Brahms, who was present at the performances on 16 December 1890. During his Budapest years Mahler&#x27;s compositional output had been limited to a few songs from the song settings that became Volumes II and III of , and amendments to the First Symphony.

====Stadttheater Hamburg====

Mahler&#x27;s Hamburg post was as chief conductor, subordinate to the director, Bernhard Pohl (known as Pollini) who retained overall artistic control. Pollini was prepared to give Mahler considerable leeway if the conductor could provide commercial as well as artistic success. This Mahler did in his first season, when he conducted Wagner&#x27;s for the first time and gave acclaimed performances of the same composer&#x27;s and . Another triumph was the German premiere of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot;, in the presence of the composer, who called Mahler&#x27;s conducting &quot;astounding&quot;, and later asserted in a letter that he believed Mahler was &quot;positively a genius&quot;. Mahler&#x27;s demanding rehearsal schedules led to predictable resentment from the singers and orchestra in whom, according to music writer Peter Franklin, the conductor &quot;inspired hatred and respect in almost equal measure&quot;. He found support, however, from Hans von Bülow, who was in Hamburg as director of the city&#x27;s subscription concerts. Bülow, who had spurned Mahler&#x27;s approaches in Kassel, had come to admire the younger man&#x27;s conducting style, and on Bülow&#x27;s death in 1894 Mahler took over the direction of the concerts.
In the summer of 1892 Mahler took the Hamburg singers to London to participate in an eight-week season of German opera—his only visit to Britain. His conducting of &quot;Tristan&quot; enthralled the young composer Ralph Vaughan Williams, who &quot;staggered home in a daze and could not sleep for two nights.&quot; However, Mahler refused further such invitations as he was anxious to reserve his summers for composing. In 1893 he acquired a retreat at Steinbach, on the banks of Lake Attersee in Upper Austria, and established a pattern that persisted for the rest of his life; summers would henceforth be dedicated to composition, at Steinbach or its successor retreats. Now firmly under the influence of the folk-poem collection, Mahler produced a stream of song settings at Steinbach, and composed his Second and Third Symphonies there.

Performances of Mahler works were still comparatively rare (he had not composed very much). On 27 October 1893, at Hamburg&#x27;s Konzerthaus Ludwig, Mahler conducted a revised version of his First Symphony; still in its original five-movement form, it was presented as a (tone poem) under the descriptive name &quot;Titan&quot;. This concert also introduced six recent settings. Mahler achieved his first relative success as a composer when the Second Symphony was well-received on its premiere in Berlin, under his own baton, on 13 December 1895. Mahler&#x27;s conducting assistant Bruno Walter, who was present, said that &quot;one may date [Mahler&#x27;s] rise to fame as a composer from that day.&quot; That same year Mahler&#x27;s private life had been disrupted by the suicide of his younger brother Otto on 6 February.

At the Stadttheater Mahler&#x27;s repertory consisted of 66 operas of which 36 titles were new to him. During his six years in Hamburg, he conducted 744 performances, including the debuts of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot;, Humperdinck&#x27;s &quot;Hänsel und Gretel&quot;, and works by Smetana. However, he was forced to resign his post with the subscription concerts after poor financial returns and an ill-received interpretation of his re-scored Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony. Already at an early age Mahler had made it clear that his ultimate goal was an appointment in Vienna, and from 1895 onward was manoeuvring, with the help of influential friends, to secure the directorship of the Vienna Hofoper. He overcame the bar that existed against the appointment of a Jew to this post by what may have been a pragmatic conversion to Catholicism in February 1897. Despite this event, Mahler has been described as a lifelong agnostic.

===Vienna, 1897–1907===

====Hofoper director====
As he waited for the Emperor&#x27;s confirmation of his directorship, Mahler shared duties as a resident conductor with Joseph Hellmesberger Jr. (son of the former conservatory director) and Hans Richter, an internationally renowned interpreter of Wagner and the conductor of the original &quot;Ring&quot; cycle at Bayreuth in 1876. Director Wilhelm Jahn had not consulted Richter about Mahler&#x27;s appointment; Mahler, sensitive to the situation, wrote Richter a complimentary letter expressing unswerving admiration for the older conductor. Subsequently, the two were rarely in agreement, but kept their divisions private.

Vienna, the imperial Habsburg capital, had recently elected an anti-Semitic conservative mayor, Karl Lueger, who had once proclaimed: &quot;I myself decide who is a Jew and who isn&#x27;t.&quot; In such a volatile political atmosphere Mahler needed an early demonstration of his German cultural credentials. He made his initial mark in May 1897 with much-praised performances of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot; and Mozart&#x27;s . Shortly after the triumph, Mahler was forced to take sick leave for several weeks, during which he was nursed by his sister Justine and his long-time companion, the viola player Natalie Bauer-Lechner. Mahler returned to Vienna in late July to prepare for Vienna&#x27;s first uncut version of the &quot;Ring&quot; cycle. This performance took place on 24–27 August, attracting critical praise and public enthusiasm. Mahler&#x27;s friend Hugo Wolf told Bauer-Lechner that &quot;for the first time I have heard the &quot;Ring&quot; as I have always dreamed of hearing it while reading the score&quot;.

On 8 October Mahler was formally appointed to succeed Jahn as the Hofoper&#x27;s director. His first production in his new office was Smetana&#x27;s Czech nationalist opera &quot;Dalibor&quot;, with a reconstituted finale that left the hero Dalibor alive. This production caused anger among the more extreme Viennese German nationalists, who accused Mahler of &quot;fraternising with the anti-dynastic, inferior Czech nation.&quot; The Austrian author Stefan Zweig, in his memoirs &quot;The World of Yesterday&quot; (1942), described Mahler&#x27;s appointment as an example of the Viennese public&#x27;s general distrust of young artists: &quot;Once, when an amazing exception occurred and Gustav Mahler was named director of the Court Opera at thirty-eight years old, a frightened murmur and astonishment ran through Vienna, because someone had entrusted the highest institute of art to &#x27;such a young person&#x27; ... This suspicion—that all young people were &#x27;not very reliable&#x27;—ran through all circles at that time.&quot; Zweig also wrote that &quot;to have seen Gustav Mahler on the street [in Vienna] was an event that one would proudly report to his comrades the next morning as it if were a personal triumph.&quot; During Mahler&#x27;s tenure a total of 33 new operas were introduced to the Hofoper; a further 55 were new or totally revamped productions. However, a proposal to stage Richard Strauss&#x27;s controversial opera &quot;Salome&quot; in 1905 was rejected by the Viennese censors.

Early in 1902 Mahler met Alfred Roller, an artist and designer associated with the Vienna Secession movement. A year later, Mahler appointed him chief stage designer to the Hofoper, where Roller&#x27;s debut was a new production of . The collaboration between Mahler and Roller created more than 20 celebrated productions of, among other operas, Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot;, Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Iphigénie en Aulide&quot; and Mozart&#x27;s . In the &quot;Figaro&quot; production, Mahler offended some purists by adding and composing a short recitative scene to Act III.

In spite of numerous theatrical triumphs, Mahler&#x27;s Vienna years were rarely smooth; his battles with singers and the house administration continued on and off for the whole of his tenure. While Mahler&#x27;s methods improved standards, his histrionic and dictatorial conducting style was resented by orchestra members and singers alike. In December 1903 Mahler faced a revolt by stagehands, whose demands for better conditions he rejected in the belief that extremists were manipulating his staff. The anti-Semitic elements in Viennese society, long opposed to Mahler&#x27;s appointment, continued to attack him relentlessly, and in 1907 instituted a press campaign designed to drive him out. By that time he was at odds with the opera house&#x27;s administration over the amount of time he was spending on his own music, and was preparing to leave. In May 1907 he began discussions with Heinrich Conried, director of the New York Metropolitan Opera, and on 21 June signed a contract, on very favourable terms, for four seasons&#x27; conducting in New York. At the end of the summer he submitted his resignation to the Hofoper, and on 15 October 1907 conducted &quot;Fidelio&quot;, his 645th and final performance there. During his ten years in Vienna, Mahler had brought new life to the opera house and cleared its debts, but had won few friends—it was said that he treated his musicians in the way a lion tamer treated his animals. His departing message to the company, which he pinned to a notice board, was later torn down and scattered over the floor. After conducting the Hofoper orchestra in a farewell concert performance of his Second Symphony on 24 November, Mahler left Vienna for New York in early December.

====Philharmonic concerts====

When Richter resigned as head of the Vienna Philharmonic subscription concerts in September 1898, the concerts committee had unanimously chosen Mahler as his successor. The appointment was not universally welcomed; the anti-Semitic press wondered if, as a non-German, Mahler would be capable of defending German music. Attendances rose sharply in Mahler&#x27;s first season, but members of the orchestra were particularly resentful of his habit of re-scoring acknowledged masterpieces, and of his scheduling of extra rehearsals for works with which they were thoroughly familiar. An attempt by the orchestra to have Richter reinstated for the 1899 season failed, because Richter was not interested. Mahler&#x27;s position was weakened when, in 1900, he took the orchestra to Paris to play at the Exposition Universelle. The Paris concerts were poorly attended and lost money—Mahler had to borrow the orchestra&#x27;s fare home from the Rothschilds. In April 1901, dogged by a recurrence of ill-health and wearied by more complaints from the orchestra, Mahler relinquished the Philharmonic concerts conductorship. In his three seasons he had performed around 80 different works, which included pieces by relatively unknown composers such as Hermann Goetz, Wilhelm Kienzl and the Italian Lorenzo Perosi.

====Mature composer====

The demands of his twin appointments in Vienna initially absorbed all Mahler&#x27;s time and energy, but by 1899 he had resumed composing. The remaining Vienna years were to prove particularly fruitful. While working on some of the last of his settings he started his Fourth Symphony, which he completed in 1900. By this time he had abandoned the composing hut at Steinbach and had acquired another, at Maiernigg on the shores of the Wörthersee in Carinthia, where he later built a villa. In this new venue Mahler embarked upon what is generally considered as his &quot;middle&quot; or post- compositional period. Between 1901 and 1904 he wrote ten settings of poems by Friedrich Rückert, five of which were collected as . The other five formed the song cycle (&quot;Songs on the Death of Children&quot;). The trilogy of orchestral symphonies, the Fifth, the Sixth and the Seventh were composed at Maiernigg between 1901 and 1905, and the Eighth Symphony written there in 1906, in eight weeks of furious activity.

Within this same period Mahler&#x27;s works began to be performed with increasing frequency. In April 1899 he conducted the Viennese premiere of his Second Symphony; 17 February 1901 saw the first public performance of his early work , in a revised two-part form. Later that year, in November, Mahler conducted the premiere of his Fourth Symphony, in Munich, and was on the rostrum for the first complete performance of the Third Symphony, at the festival at Krefeld on 9 June 1902. Mahler &quot;first nights&quot; now became increasingly frequent musical events; he conducted the first performances of the Fifth and Sixth Symphonies at Cologne and Essen respectively, in 1904 and 1906. Four of the , and , were introduced in Vienna on 29 January 1905.

====Marriage, family, tragedy====

During his second season in Vienna, Mahler acquired a spacious modern apartment on the Auenbruggergasse and built a summer villa on land he had acquired next to his new composing studio at Maiernigg. In November 1901, he met Alma Schindler, the stepdaughter of painter Carl Moll, at a social gathering that included the theatre director Max Burckhard. Alma was not initially keen to meet Mahler, on account of &quot;the scandals about him and every young woman who aspired to sing in opera.&quot; The two engaged in a lively disagreement about a ballet by Alexander von Zemlinsky (Alma was one of Zemlinsky&#x27;s pupils), but agreed to meet at the Hofoper the following day. This meeting led to a rapid courtship; Mahler and Alma were married at a private ceremony on 9 March 1902. Alma was by then pregnant with her first child, a daughter Maria Anna, who was born on 3 November 1902. A second daughter, Anna, was born in 1904.
Friends of the couple were surprised by the marriage and dubious of its wisdom. Burckhard called Mahler &quot;that rachitic degenerate Jew&quot;, unworthy for such a good-looking girl of good family. On the other hand, Mahler&#x27;s family considered Alma to be flirtatious, unreliable, and too fond of seeing young men fall for her charms. Mahler was by nature moody and authoritarian—Natalie Bauer-Lechner, his earlier partner, said that living with him was &quot;like being on a boat that is ceaselessly rocked to and fro by the waves.&quot; Alma soon became resentful because of Mahler&#x27;s insistence that there could only be one composer in the family and that she had given up her music studies to accommodate him. &quot;The role of composer, the worker&#x27;s role, falls to me, yours is that of a loving companion and understanding partner ... I&#x27;m asking a very great deal – and I can and may do so because I know what I have to give and will give in exchange.&quot; She wrote in her diary: &quot;How hard it is to be so mercilessly deprived of ... things closest to one&#x27;s heart.&quot; Mahler&#x27;s requirement that their married life be organized around his creative activities imposed strains, and precipitated rebellion on Alma&#x27;s part; the marriage was nevertheless marked at times by expressions of considerable passion, particularly from Mahler.

In the summer of 1907 Mahler, exhausted from the effects of the campaign against him in Vienna, took his family to Maiernigg. Soon after their arrival both daughters fell ill with scarlet fever and diphtheria. Anna recovered, but after a fortnight&#x27;s struggle Maria died on 12 July. Immediately following this devastating loss, Mahler learned that his heart was defective, a diagnosis subsequently confirmed by a Vienna specialist, who ordered a curtailment of all forms of vigorous exercise. The extent to which Mahler&#x27;s condition disabled him is unclear; Alma wrote of it as a virtual death sentence, though Mahler himself, in a letter written to her on 30 August 1907, said that he would be able to live a normal life, apart from avoiding over-fatigue. The illness was, however, a further depressing factor. Mahler and his family left Maiernigg and spent the rest of the summer at Schluderbach. At the end of the summer the villa at Maiernigg was closed and never revisited.
===Last years, 1908–1911===

====New York====

Mahler made his New York debut at the Metropolitan Opera on 1 January 1908, when he conducted Wagner&#x27;s . In a busy first season Mahler&#x27;s performances were widely praised, especially his &quot;Fidelio&quot; on 20 March 1908, in which he insisted on using replicas that were at the time being made of Alfred Roller&#x27;s Vienna sets. On his return to Austria for the summer of 1908, Mahler established himself in the third and last of his composing studios, in the pine forests close to Toblach in Tyrol. Here, using a text by Hans Bethge based on ancient Chinese poems, he composed (&quot;The Song of the Earth&quot;). Despite the symphonic nature of the work, Mahler refused to number it, hoping thereby to escape the &quot;curse of the Ninth Symphony&quot; that he believed had affected fellow-composers Beethoven, Schubert and Bruckner. On 19 September 1908 the premiere of the Seventh Symphony, in Prague, was deemed by Alma Mahler a critical rather than a popular success.
For its 1908–09 season the Metropolitan management brought in the Italian conductor Arturo Toscanini to share duties with Mahler, who made only 19 appearances in the entire season. One of these was a much-praised performance of Smetana&#x27;s &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot; on 19 February 1909. In the early part of the season Mahler conducted three concerts with the New York Symphony Orchestra. This renewed experience of orchestral conducting inspired him to resign his position with the opera house and accept the conductorship of the re-formed New York Philharmonic. He continued to make occasional guest appearances at the Met, his last performance being Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot; on 5 March 1910.

Back in Europe for the summer of 1909, Mahler worked on his Ninth Symphony and made a conducting tour of the Netherlands. The 1909–10 New York Philharmonic season was long and taxing; Mahler rehearsed and conducted 46 concerts, but his programmes were often too demanding for popular tastes. His own First Symphony, given its American debut on 16 December 1909, was one of the pieces that failed with critics and public, and the season ended with heavy financial losses. The highlight of Mahler&#x27;s 1910 summer was the first performance of the Eighth Symphony at Munich on 12 September, the last of his works to be premiered in his lifetime. The occasion was a triumph—&quot;easily Mahler&#x27;s biggest lifetime success&quot;, according to Carr—but it was overshadowed by the composer&#x27;s discovery, before the event, that Alma had begun an affair with the young architect Walter Gropius. Greatly distressed, Mahler sought advice from Sigmund Freud, and appeared to gain some comfort from his meeting with the psychoanalyst. One of Freud&#x27;s observations was that much damage had been done by Mahler&#x27;s insisting that Alma give up her composing. Mahler accepted this, and started to positively encourage her to write music, even editing, orchestrating and promoting some of her works. Alma agreed to remain with Mahler, although the relationship with Gropius continued surreptitiously. In a gesture of love, Mahler dedicated his Eighth Symphony to her.

====Illness and death====

In spite of the emotional distractions, during the summer of 1910 Mahler worked on his Tenth Symphony, completing the Adagio and drafting four more movements. He and Alma returned to New York in late October 1910, where Mahler threw himself into a busy Philharmonic season of concerts and tours. Around Christmas 1910 he began suffering from a sore throat, which persisted. On 21 February 1911, with a temperature of 40 °C (104 °F), Mahler insisted on fulfilling an engagement at Carnegie Hall, with a program of mainly new Italian music, including the world premiere of Busoni&#x27;s . This was Mahler&#x27;s last concert. After weeks confined to bed he was diagnosed with bacterial endocarditis, a disease to which people with defective heart valves were particularly prone and which could be fatal. Mahler did not give up hope; he talked of resuming the concert season, and took a keen interest when one of Alma&#x27;s compositions was sung at a public recital by the soprano Frances Alda, on 3 March. On 8 April the Mahler family and a permanent nurse left New York on board SS &quot;Amerika&quot; bound for Europe. They reached Paris ten days later, where Mahler entered a clinic at Neuilly, but there was no improvement; on 11 May he was taken by train to the Löw sanatorium in Vienna, where he developed pneumonia and slipped into a coma. Hundreds had come to the sanitorium during this brief period to show their admiration for the great composer. After receiving treatments of radium to reduce swelling on his legs and morphine for his general ailments, he died on 18 May.

On 22 May 1911 Mahler was buried in the , as he had requested, next to his daughter Maria. His tombstone was inscribed only with his name because &quot;any who come to look for me will know who I was and the rest don&#x27;t need to know.&quot; Alma, on doctors&#x27; orders, was absent, but among the mourners at a relatively pomp-free funeral were Arnold Schoenberg (whose wreath described Mahler as &quot;the holy Gustav Mahler&quot;), Bruno Walter, Alfred Roller, the Secessionist painter Gustav Klimt, and representatives from many of the great European opera houses. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, reporting Mahler&#x27;s death, called him &quot;one of the towering musical figures of his day&quot;, but discussed his symphonies mainly in terms of their duration, incidentally exaggerating the length of the Second Symphony to &quot;two hours and forty minutes&quot;. In London, &quot;The Times&quot; obituary said his conducting was &quot;more accomplished than that of any man save Richter&quot;, and that his symphonies were &quot;undoubtedly interesting in their union of modern orchestral richness with a melodic simplicity that often approached banality&quot;, though it was too early to judge their ultimate worth.

Alma Mahler survived her husband by more than 50 years, dying in 1964. She married Walter Gropius in 1915, divorced him five years later, and married the writer Franz Werfel in 1929. In 1940 she published a memoir of her years with Mahler, entitled &quot;Gustav Mahler: Memories and Letters&quot;. This account was criticised by later biographers as incomplete, selective and self-serving, and for providing a distorted picture of Mahler&#x27;s life. The composer&#x27;s daughter Anna Mahler became a well-known sculptor; she died in 1988. The International Gustav Mahler Society was founded in 1955 in Vienna, with Bruno Walter as its first president and Alma Mahler as an honorary member. The Society aims to create a complete critical edition of Mahler&#x27;s works, and to commemorate all aspects of the composer&#x27;s life.

==Music==
===Three creative periods===

Deryck Cooke and other analysts have divided Mahler&#x27;s composing life into three distinct phases: a long &quot;first period&quot;, extending from in 1880 to the end of the phase in 1901; a &quot;middle period&quot; of more concentrated composition ending with Mahler&#x27;s departure for New York in 1907; and a brief &quot;late period&quot; of elegiac works before his death in 1911.

The main works of the first period are the first four symphonies, the song cycle and various song collections in which the songs predominate. In this period songs and symphonies are closely related and the symphonic works are programmatic. Mahler initially gave the first three symphonies full descriptive programmes, all of which he later repudiated. He devised, but did not publish, titles for each of the movements for the Fourth Symphony; from these titles the German music critic Paul Bekker conjectured a programme in which Death appears in the Scherzo &quot;in the friendly, legendary guise of the fiddler tempting his flock to follow him out of this world.&quot;

The middle period comprises a triptych of purely instrumental symphonies (the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh), the &quot;Rückert&quot; songs and the , two final settings and, in some reckonings, Mahler&#x27;s last great affirmative statement, the choral Eighth Symphony. Cooke believes that the Eighth stands on its own, between the middle and final periods. Mahler had by now abandoned all explicit programmes and descriptive titles; he wanted to write &quot;absolute&quot; music that spoke for itself. Cooke refers to &quot;a new granite-like hardness of orchestration&quot; in the middle-period symphonies, while the songs have lost most of their folk character, and cease to fertilise the symphonies as explicitly as before.

The three works of the brief final period—, the Ninth and (incomplete) Tenth Symphonies—are expressions of personal experience, as Mahler faced death. Each of the pieces ends quietly, signifying that aspiration has now given way to resignation. Cooke considers these works to be a loving (rather than a bitter) farewell to life; the composer Alban Berg called the Ninth &quot;the most marvellous thing that Mahler ever wrote&quot;. None of these final works were performed in Mahler&#x27;s lifetime.

===Antecedents and influences===
Mahler was a &quot;late Romantic&quot;, part of an ideal that placed Austro-German classical music on a higher plane than other types, through its supposed possession of particular spiritual and philosophical significance. He was one of the last major composers of a line which includes, among others, Beethoven, Schubert, Liszt, Wagner, Bruckner and Brahms. From these antecedents Mahler drew many of the features that were to characterise his music. Thus, from Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony came the idea of using soloists and a choir within the symphonic genre. From Beethoven, Liszt and (from a different musical tradition) Berlioz came the concept of writing music with an inherent narrative or &quot;programme&quot;, and of breaking away from the traditional four-movement symphony format. The examples of Wagner and Bruckner encouraged Mahler to extend the scale of his symphonic works well beyond the previously accepted standards, to embrace an entire world of feeling.

Early critics maintained that Mahler&#x27;s adoption of many different styles to suit different expressions of feeling meant that he lacked a style of his own; Cooke on the other hand asserts that Mahler &quot;redeemed any borrowings by imprinting his [own] personality on practically every note&quot; to produce music of &quot;outstanding originality.&quot; The music critic Harold Schonberg sees the essence of Mahler&#x27;s music in the theme of struggle, in the tradition of Beethoven. However, according to Schonberg, Beethoven&#x27;s struggles were those of &quot;an indomitable and triumphant hero&quot;, whereas Mahler&#x27;s are those of &quot;a psychic weakling, a complaining adolescent who ... enjoyed his misery, wanting the whole world to see how he was suffering.&quot; Yet, Schonberg concedes, most of the symphonies contain sections in which Mahler the &quot;deep thinker&quot; is transcended by the splendour of Mahler the musician.

===Genre===
Except for his juvenilia, little of which has survived, Mahler composed only in the media of song and symphony, with a close and complex interrelationship between the two. Donald Mitchell writes that this interaction is the backcloth against which all Mahler&#x27;s music can be considered. The initial connection between song and symphony occurs with the song cycle and the First Symphony. Although this early evidence of cross-fertilisation is important, it is during Mahler&#x27;s extended phase, in which his Second, Third and Fourth Symphonies were written, that the song and symphony genres are consistently intermingled. Themes from the song (&quot;The Heavenly Life&quot;), composed in 1892, became a key element in the Third Symphony completed in 1896; the song itself forms the finale to the Fourth (1900) and its melody is central to the whole composition. For the Second Symphony, written between 1888 and 1894, Mahler worked simultaneously on the song, (&quot;The Sermon of St Anthony of Padua to the Fishes&quot;), and on the Scherzo based on it which became the symphony&#x27;s third movement. Another setting from 1892, (&quot;Primal Light&quot;), is used as the Second Symphony&#x27;s fourth (penultimate) movement.

In Mahler&#x27;s middle and late periods, the song–symphony relationship is less direct. However, musicologist Donald Mitchell notes specific relationships between the middle period songs and their contemporaneous symphonies—the second song and the Adagietto from the Fifth Symphony, the last song and the Sixth Symphony finale. Mahler&#x27;s last work employing vocal and orchestral forces, , is subtitled &quot;A Symphony ...&quot;—Mitchell categorises it as a &quot;song &quot;and&quot; symphony.&quot;

===Style===
The union of song and symphonic form in Mahler&#x27;s music is, in Cooke&#x27;s view, organic; &quot;his songs flower naturally into symphonic movements, being already symphonic in cast.&quot; To Sibelius, Mahler expressed the belief that &quot;The symphony must be like the world. It must embrace everything.&quot; True to this belief, Mahler drew material from many sources into his songs and symphonic works: bird calls and cow-bells to evoke nature and the countryside, bugle fanfares, street melodies and country dances to summon the lost world of his childhood. Life&#x27;s struggles are represented in contrasting moods: the yearning for fulfilment by soaring melodies and chromatic harmony, suffering and despair by discord, distortion and grotesquerie. Amid all this is Mahler&#x27;s particular hallmark—the constant intrusion of banality and absurdity into moments of deep seriousness, typified in the second movement of the Fifth Symphony when a trivial popular tune suddenly cuts into a solemn funeral march. The trite melody soon changes its character, and in due course re-emerges as one of the majestic Brucknerian chorales which Mahler uses to signify hope and the resolution of conflict. Mahler himself recognised the idiosyncrasies in his work, calling the Scherzo in the Third Symphony &quot;the most farcical and at the same time the most tragic piece that ever existed ... It is as though all nature is making faces and sticking out its tongue.&quot;

The range of musical moods, Cooke maintains, comes from Mahler&#x27;s &quot;amazing orchestration&quot; which, in the writer&#x27;s view, defies analysis—&quot;it speaks for itself.&quot; Franklin lists specific features which are basic to Mahler&#x27;s style: extremes of volume, the use of off-stage ensembles, unconventional arrangement of orchestral forces, and frequent recourse to popular music and dance forms such as the ländler and the waltz. Musicologist Vladimír Karbusický maintains that the composer&#x27;s Jewish roots had lasting effects on his creative output; he pinpoints the central part of the third movement of the First Symphony as the most characteristically &quot;Yiddish&quot; music in Mahler&#x27;s work. The Czech composer-journalist Max Brod has also identified Jewish tunes and rhythms in Mahler&#x27;s music.

A technical device much used by Mahler is that of &quot;progressive tonality&quot;, which Deryck Cooke describes as &quot;the procedure of resolving a symphonic conflict in a different key from that in which it was stated&quot;, and which is often used &quot;to symbolise the gradual ascendancy of a certain value by progress from one key to another over the whole course of a symphony&quot;. This technique was also used by Mahler&#x27;s Danish contemporary Carl Nielsen. Mahler first employed the device in an early song, (&quot;Memory&quot;), and thereafter used it freely in his symphonies. For example, the predominant key of the First Symphony is D major; at the beginning of the Finale, the &quot;conflict&quot; movement, the key switches to F minor, and only after a lengthy battle gets back to D, near the end. The Second Symphony begins in C minor and ends in E-flat. The movements of the Fifth Symphony progress successively from C-sharp minor to A minor, then D major, F major and finally to D major. The Sixth Symphony, unusually for Mahler, begins and ends in the same key, A minor, signifying that in this case the conflict is unresolved.

===Reception===

====Early responses, 1889–1911====
Mahler&#x27;s friend Guido Adler calculated that at the time of the composer&#x27;s death in 1911 there had been more than 260 performances of the symphonies in Europe, Russia and America, the Fourth Symphony with 61 performances given most frequently (Adler did not enumerate performances of the songs). In his lifetime, Mahler&#x27;s works and their performances attracted wide interest, but rarely unqualified approval; for years after its 1889 premiere critics and public struggled to understand the First Symphony, described by one critic after an 1898 Dresden performance as &quot;the dullest [symphonic] work the new epoch has produced&quot;. The Second Symphony was received more positively, one critic calling it &quot;the most masterly work of its kind since Mendelssohn&quot;. Such generous praise was rare, particularly after Mahler&#x27;s accession to the Vienna Hofoper directorship. His many enemies in the city used the anti-Semitic and conservative press to denigrate almost every performance of a Mahler work; thus the Third Symphony, a success in Krefeld in 1902, was treated in Vienna with critical scorn: &quot;Anyone who has committed such a deed deserves a couple of years in prison.&quot;

A mix of enthusiasm, consternation and critical contempt became the normal response to new Mahler symphonies, although the songs were better received. After his Fourth and Fifth Symphonies failed to gain general public approval, Mahler was convinced that his Sixth would finally succeed. However, its reception was dominated by satirical comments on Mahler&#x27;s unconventional percussion effects—the use of a wooden mallet, birch rods and a huge square bass drum. Viennese critic Heinrich Reinhardt dismissed the symphony as &quot;Brass, lots of brass, incredibly much brass! Even more brass, nothing but brass!&quot; The one unalloyed performance triumph within Mahler&#x27;s lifetime was the premiere of the Eighth Symphony in Munich, on 12 September 1910, advertised by its promoters as the &quot;Symphony of a Thousand&quot;. At its conclusion, applause and celebrations reportedly lasted for half an hour.

====Relative neglect, 1911–1950====
Performances of Mahler&#x27;s works became less frequent after his death. In the Netherlands the advocacy of Willem Mengelberg ensured that Mahler remained popular there, and Mengelberg&#x27;s engagement with the New York Philharmonic from 1922 to 1928 brought Mahler regularly to American audiences. However, much American critical reaction in the 1920s was negative, despite a spirited effort by the young composer Aaron Copland to present Mahler as a progressive, 30 years ahead of his time and infinitely more inventive than Richard Strauss. Earlier, in 1916, Leopold Stokowski had given the American premieres of the Eighth Symphony and in Philadelphia. The Eighth was a sensationally successful performance that was immediately taken to New York where it scored a further triumph.

An early proponent of Mahler&#x27;s work in Britain was Adrian Boult, who as conductor of the City of Birmingham Orchestra performed the Fourth Symphony in 1926 and in 1930. The Hallé Orchestra brought and the Ninth Symphony to Manchester in 1931; Sir Henry Wood staged the Eighth in London in 1930, and again in 1938 when the young Benjamin Britten found the performance &quot;execrable&quot; but was nevertheless impressed by the music. British critics during this period largely treated Mahler with condescension and faint praise. Thus Dyneley Hussey, writing in 1934, thought the &quot;children&#x27;s songs&quot; were delightful, but that the symphonies should be let go. Composer-conductor Julius Harrison described Mahler&#x27;s symphonies as &quot;interesting at times, but laboriously put together&quot; and as lacking creative spark. Bernard Shaw reported that the younger generation of the 1930s found Mahler (and Bruckner) &quot;expensively second-class&quot;.

Before Mahler&#x27;s music was banned as &quot;degenerate&quot; during the Nazi era, the symphonies and songs were played in the concert halls of Germany and Austria, often conducted by Bruno Walter or Mahler&#x27;s younger assistant Otto Klemperer, and also by Willem Mengelberg. In Austria, Mahler&#x27;s work experienced a brief renaissance between 1934 and 1938, a period known today as &#x27;Austrofascism&#x27;, when the authoritarian regime with the help of Alma Mahler and Bruno Walter, who were both on friendly terms with the new chancellor Kurt Schuschnigg, sought to make Mahler into a national icon (with a status comparable to that of Wagner in Germany). Mahler&#x27;s music was performed during the Nazi era in Berlin in early 1941 and in Amsterdam during the German occupation of the Netherlands by Jewish orchestras and for Jewish audiences alone; works performed included the Second Symphony (Berlin), the First and Fourth Symphonies, and the &quot;Songs of a Wayfarer&quot; (Amsterdam).

====Modern revival====
According to American composer David Schiff, his compatriot Leonard Bernstein used to imply that he had single-handedly rescued Mahler from oblivion in 1960, after 50 years of neglect. Schiff points out that such neglect was only relative—far less than the (incomplete) disregard of Bach in the years after his death. Although Bernstein gave the Mahler revival further impetus, it was well under way before 1960, sustained by conductors such as Stokowski, Dimitri Mitropoulos and John Barbirolli, and by the long-time Mahler advocate Aaron Copland. Mahler himself predicted his place in history, once commenting: &quot;Would that I could perform my symphonies for the first time 50 years after my death!&quot;

Deryck Cooke argues that Mahler&#x27;s popularity escalated when a new, postwar generation of music lovers arose, untainted by &quot;the dated polemics of anti-romanticism&quot; which had affected Mahler&#x27;s reputation in the inter-war years. In this more-liberated age, enthusiasm for Mahler expanded even into places—Spain, France, Italy—which had long been resistant to him. Jonathan Carr&#x27;s simpler explanation for the 1950s Mahler revival is that &quot;it was the long-playing record [in the early 1950s] rather than the which made a comprehensive breakthrough possible. Mahler&#x27;s work became accessible and repeatable in the home.&quot; In the years following his centenary in 1960, Mahler rapidly became one of the most performed and most recorded of all composers, and has largely remained thus. In Britain and elsewhere, Carr notes, the extent of Mahler performances and recordings has replaced a relative famine with a glut, bringing problems of over-familiarity. Harold Schonberg comments that &quot;it is hard to think of a composer who arouses equal loyalty&quot;, adding that &quot;a response of anything short of rapture to the Mahler symphonies will bring [to the critic] long letters of furious denunciation.&quot;

In a letter to Alma dated 16 February 1902, Mahler wrote, with reference to Richard Strauss: &quot;My day will come when his is ended. If only I might live to see it, with you at my side!&quot; Carr observes that Mahler could conceivably have lived to see &quot;his day&quot;; his near-contemporary Richard Strauss survived until 1949, while Sibelius, just five years younger than Mahler, lived until 1957.

===Later influence===
 Donald Mitchell writes that Mahler&#x27;s influence on succeeding generations of composers is &quot;a complete subject in itself&quot;. Mahler&#x27;s first disciples included Arnold Schoenberg and his pupils Alban Berg and Anton Webern, who together founded the Second Viennese School. Mahler&#x27;s music influenced the trio&#x27;s move from progressive tonalism to atonality (music without a key); although Mahler rejected atonality, he became a fierce defender of the bold originality of Schoenberg&#x27;s work. At the premiere of the latter&#x27;s First String Quartet in February 1907, Mahler reportedly was held back from physically attacking the hecklers. Schoenberg&#x27;s Serenade, Op. 24 (1923), Berg&#x27;s Three Pieces for Orchestra (1915) and Webern&#x27;s Six Pieces (1928) all carry echoes of Mahler&#x27;s Seventh Symphony. Mahler has also influenced the film scores of John Williams and other Hollywood composers.

Among other composers whose work carries the influence of Mahler, Mitchell lists America&#x27;s Aaron Copland, the German song and stage composer Kurt Weill, Italy&#x27;s Luciano Berio, Russia&#x27;s Dmitri Shostakovich and England&#x27;s Benjamin Britten. The American composers Leonard Bernstein and Samuel Barber were also influenced by Mahler&#x27;s work. In a 1989 interview the pianist-conductor Vladimir Ashkenazy said that the connection between Mahler and Shostakovich was &quot;very strong and obvious&quot;; their music represented &quot;the individual versus the vices of the world.&quot; Mitchell highlights Britten&#x27;s &quot;marvellously keen, spare and independent writing for the wind in ... the first movement of the Cello Symphony of 1963 [which] clearly belongs to that order of dazzling transparency and instrumental emancipation which Mahler did so much to establish.&quot; Mitchell concludes with the statement: &quot;Even were his own music not to survive, Mahler would still enjoy a substantial immortality in the music of these pre-eminent successors who have embraced his art and assimilated his techniques.&quot; A 2016 &quot;BBC Music Magazine&quot; survey of 151 conductors ranked three of his symphonies in the top ten symphonies of all time.

== Memorials and museums ==
In Hamburg, the Gustav Mahler Museum is dedicated to Gustav Mahler&#x27;s life and work. It is situated in the Composers Quarter. In Altschluderbach, near Toblach in South Tyrol, Italy, there remains a little museum and memorial in the former composer&#x27;s hut of Mahler. It is situated in the animal park next to the Gustav Mahler Stube. The &quot;Stube&quot; formerly had a museum on the first floor. There, Mahler and his wife Alma resided from 1907 to 1910. 
Two of the other composer&#x27;s huts used by Mahler still exist; both are equipped as little museums. There is one composing hut at the Attersee, Upper Austria, and one at the Wörthersee in Carinthia. Mount Mahler in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado is named in honour of the composer.

<doc id="65178" wikidata="Q843281" url="?curid=65178" title="Hobo">
<text>A hobo is a migrant worker in the United States. Hoboes, tramps, and bums are generally regarded as related, but distinct: a hobo travels and is willing to work; a tramp travels, but avoids work if possible; a bum neither travels nor works.

==Etymology==

The origin of the term is unknown. According to etymologist Anatoly Liberman, the only certain detail about its origin is the word was first noticed in American English circa 1890. The term has also been dated to 1889 in the Western—probably Northwestern—United States, and to 1888. Liberman points out that many folk etymologies fail to answer the question: &quot;Why did the word become widely known in California (just there) by the early Nineties (just then)?&quot; Author Todd DePastino mentions possible derivations from &quot;hoe-boy&quot;, meaning &quot;farmhand&quot;, or a greeting &quot;Ho, boy&quot;, but that he does not find these convincing. Bill Bryson suggests in &quot;Made in America&quot; (1998) that it might come from the railroad greeting, &quot;Ho, beau!&quot; or a syllabic abbreviation of &quot;homeward bound&quot;. It could also come from the words &quot;homeless boy&quot; or &quot;homeless Bohemian&quot;. H. L. Mencken, in his &quot;The American Language&quot; (4th ed., 1937), wrote:

Tramps and hobos are commonly lumped together, but in their own sight they are sharply differentiated. A &quot;hobo&quot; or &quot;bo&quot; is simply a migratory laborer; he may take some longish holidays, but soon or late he returns to work. A &quot;tramp&quot; never works if it can be avoided; he simply travels. Lower than either is the &quot;bum&quot;, who neither works nor travels, save when impelled to motion by the police.

==History==

While there have been drifters in every society, the term became common only after the broad adoption of railroads provided free, though illegal, travel by hopping aboard train cars (so-called &quot;freighthopping&quot;). With the end of the American Civil War in the 1860s, many discharged veterans returning home began to hop freight trains. Others looking for work on the American frontier followed the railways west aboard freight trains in the late 19th century.

In 1906, Professor Layal Shafee, after an exhaustive study, put the number of tramps in the United States at about 500,000 (about 0.6% of the US population at the time). His article &quot;What Tramps Cost Nation&quot; was published by &quot;The New York Telegraph&quot; in 1911, when he estimated the number had surged to 700,000.

The number of hoboes increased greatly during the Great Depression era of the 1930s. With no work and no prospects at home, many decided to try their luck elsewhere by freight train.

Hobo life was dangerous. Itinerant, poor, far from home and support, hoboes also faced the hostility of many train crews and the railroad police, nicknamed &quot;bulls&quot;, who often dealt violently with trespassers. British poet W. H. Davies, author of &quot;The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp&quot;, lost a foot when he fell under the wheels trying to jump aboard a train. It was easy to get trapped between cars, and one could freeze to death in cold weather. When freezer cars were loaded at an ice factory, any hobo inside was likely to be killed.

Around the end of World War II, railroads began to move from steam to diesel locomotives, making jumping freight trains more difficult. This, along with postwar prosperity, led to a decline in the number of hoboes. In the 1970s and 1980s hobo numbers were augmented by returning Vietnam War veterans, many of whom were disillusioned with settled society. Overall, the national economic demand for a mobile surplus labor force has declined over time, leading to fewer hoboes.

==Culture==

===Expressions used through the 1940s===

Hoboes were noted for, among other things, the distinctive lingo that arose among them. Some examples follow:
Many hobo terms have become part of common language, such as &quot;big house&quot;, &quot;glad rags&quot;, &quot;main drag&quot;, and others.

===Hobo signs and graffiti===
Almost from the beginning of the existence of hoboes, as early as the 1870s, it was reported that they communicated with each other by way of a system of cryptic &quot;hobo signs&quot;, which would be chalked in prominent or relevant places to clandestinely alert future hoboes about important local information. Many listings of these symbols have been made. A few symbols include:
* A triangle with hands, signifying that the homeowner has a gun.
* A horizontal zigzag signifying a barking dog.
* A circle with two parallel arrows meaning &quot;Get out fast,&quot; as hoboes are not welcome in the area.
* A cat signifying that a kind lady lives here.

Reports of hoboes using these symbols appeared in newspapers and popular books straight through the Depression, and continue to turn up in American popular culture; for example, John Hodgman&#x27;s book &quot;The Areas of My Expertise&quot; features a section on hobo signs listing signs found in newspapers of the day as well as several whimsical ones invented by Hodgman, and the Free Art and Technology Lab released a QR Hobo Code, with a QR stenciler, in July 2011. Displays on hobo signs have been exhibited in the Steamtown National Historic Site at Scranton, Pennsylvania, operated by the National Park Service, and in the National Cryptologic Museum in Annapolis Junction, Maryland, and Webster&#x27;s &quot;Third New International Dictionary&quot; supplies a listing of hobo signs under the entry for &quot;hobo&quot;.
Despite an apparently strong record of authentication, however, there is doubt as to whether hobo signs were ever actually in practical use by hoboes. They may simply have been invented early on by a writer or writers seeking to add to the folklore surrounding hoboes soon after they acquired the name, an invention perpetuated and embellished by others over the years, aided occasionally by amenable hoboes themselves. Several hoboes during the days that the signs were reportedly most in use asserted that they were in fact a &quot;popular fancy&quot; or &quot;a fabrication&quot;. Nels Anderson, who both hoboed himself and studied hoboes extensively for a University of Chicago master&#x27;s thesis, wrote in 1932,Another merit of the book [Godfrey Irwin&#x27;s 1931 &quot;American Tramp and Underworld Slang&quot;] is that the author has not subscribed to the fiction that American tramps have a sign language, as so many professors are wont to believe. Though newspapers in the early and peak days of hoboing (1870s through the Depression) printed photos and drawings of hoboes leaving these signs, these may have been staged in order to add color to the story.

Nonetheless, it is certain that hoboes have used some graffiti to communicate, in the form of &quot;monikers&quot; (sometimes &quot;monicas&quot;). These generally consisted simply of a road name (moniker), a date, and the direction the hobo was heading then. This would be written in a prominent location where other hoboes would see it. Jack London, in recounting his hobo days, wrote,Water-tanks are tramp directories. Not all in idle wantonness do tramps carve their monicas, dates, and courses. Often and often have I met hoboes earnestly inquiring if I had seen anywhere such and such a &quot;stiff&quot; or his monica. And more than once I have been able to give the monica of recent date, the water-tank, and the direction in which he was then bound. And promptly the hobo to whom I gave the information lit out after his pal. I have met hoboes who, in trying to catch a pal, had pursued clear across the continent and back again, and were still going.The use of monikers persists to this day, although since the rise of cell phones a moniker is more often used simply to &quot;tag&quot; a train car or location. Some moniker writers have tagged train cars extensively; one who tagged under the name Bozo Texino during the 1970s and ’80s estimated that in one year (&quot;where I went overboard&quot;) he marked over 30,000 train cars. However, not all moniker writers (or &quot;boxcar artists&quot;) are hoboes; Bozo Texino in fact worked for the railroad, though others such as &quot;A No. 1&quot; and &quot;Palm Tree Herby&quot; rode trains as tramps or hoboes.

===Ethical code===

Hobo culture—though it has always had many points of contact with the mainstream American culture of its day—has also always been somewhat separate and distinct, with different cultural norms. Hobo culture&#x27;s ethics have always been subject to disapproval from the mainstream culture; for example, hopping freight trains, an integral part of hobo life, has always been illegal in the U.S. Nonetheless, the ethics of hobo culture can be regarded as fairly coherent and internally consistent, at least to the extent that any culture&#x27;s various individual people maintain the same ethical standards. That is to say, any attempt at an exhaustive enumeration of hobo ethics is bound to be foiled at least to some extent by the diversity of hoboes and their ideas of the world. This difficulty has not kept hoboes themselves from attempting the exercise. An ethical code was created by Tourist Union #63 (a hobo union created in the mid-1800s to dodge anti-vagrancy laws, which did not apply to union members) during its 1889 National Hobo Convention:

# Decide your own life; don&#x27;t let another person run or rule you.
# When in town, always respect the local law and officials, and try to be a gentleman at all times.
# Don&#x27;t take advantage of someone who is in a vulnerable situation, locals or other hoboes.
# Always try to find work, even if temporary, and always seek out jobs nobody wants. By doing so you not only help a business along, but ensure employment should you return to that town again.
# When no employment is available, make your own work by using your added talents at crafts.
# Do not allow yourself to become a stupid drunk and set a bad example for locals&#x27; treatment of other hoboes.
# When jungling in town, respect handouts and do not wear them out; another hobo will be coming along who will need them as badly, if not worse than you.
# Always respect nature; do not leave garbage where you are jungling.
# If in a community jungle, always pitch in and help.
# Try to stay clean, and boil up wherever possible.
# When traveling, ride your train respectfully. Take no personal chances. Cause no problems with operating crew or host railroad. Act like an extra crew member.
# Do not cause problems in a train yard; another hobo will be coming along who will need passage through that yard.
# Do not allow other hoboes to molest children; expose all molesters to authorities – they are the worst garbage to infest any society.
# Help all runaway children, and try to induce them to return home.
# Help your fellow hoboes whenever and wherever needed; you may need their help someday.
# If present at a hobo court and you have testimony, give it. Whether for or against the accused, your voice counts!
== Conventions ==

===General===

There are numerous hobo conventions throughout the United States each year. The ephemeral ways of hobo conventions are mostly dependent on the resources of their hosts. Some conventions are part of railroad conventions or &quot;railroad days&quot;; others quasi-private affairs hosted by long-time hoboes; still others surreptitious affairs on private land, as in abandoned quarries along major rivers.

Most non-mainstream conventions are held at current or historical railroad stops. The most notable is the National Hobo Convention held in Britt, Iowa. The town first hosted the Convention in 1900, but there followed a hiatus of thirty-three years. Since 1934 the convention has been held annually in Britt, on the second weekend in August.

<text>Nyarlathotep is a fictional character created by H. P. Lovecraft. The character is a malign deity in the Cthulhu Mythos, a shared universe. First appearing in Lovecraft&#x27;s 1920 prose poem &quot;Nyarlathotep&quot;, he was later mentioned in other works by Lovecraft and by other writers, to the point of often being considered the main antagonist of the Cthulhu Mythos as a whole. He is presented as the messenger of Azathoth. He is later described by other authors as being part of the Other Gods, an alien pantheon.

== Appearances ==
=== In the works of H. P. Lovecraft ===
In his first appearance in &quot;Nyarlathotep&quot; (1920), he is described as a &quot;tall, swarthy man&quot; who resembles an ancient Egyptian pharaoh. In this story he wanders the Earth, seemingly gathering legions of followers, the narrator of the story among them, through his demonstrations of strange and seemingly magical instruments. These followers lose awareness of the world around them, and through the narrator&#x27;s increasingly unreliable accounts, the reader gets an impression of the world&#x27;s collapse. Fritz Leiber proposes three interpretations of the character based on this appearance: the universe&#x27;s mockery of man&#x27;s attempts to understand it; a negative view of the commercial world, represented by Nyarlathotep&#x27;s self-promotion and contemptuous attitude; and man&#x27;s self-destructive rationality.

Nyarlathotep subsequently appears as a major character in &quot;The Dream Quest of Unknown Kadath&quot; (1926/27), in which he again manifests in the form of an Egyptian pharaoh when he confronts protagonist Randolph Carter. Leiber describes Nyarlathotep as &quot;evilly intelligent&quot; in this story, in contrast to the mindless Azathoth, his master.

The 21st sonnet of Lovecraft&#x27;s poem-cycle &quot;Fungi from Yuggoth&quot; (1929/30) is essentially a retelling of the original prose poem.

In &quot;The Dreams in the Witch House&quot; (1933), Nyarlathotep appears to Walter Gilman and witch Keziah Mason (who has made a pact with the entity) in the form of &quot;the &#x27;Black Man&#x27; of the witch-cult&quot;, a black-skinned avatar of the Devil described by witch hunters. Although inhuman, some characters mistake him as a human of African descent, though his facial features are described as Caucasian.

Finally, in &quot;The Haunter of the Dark&quot; (1936), the nocturnal, tentacled, bat-winged monster dwelling in the steeple of the Starry Wisdom sect&#x27;s church is identified as another manifestation of Nyarlathotep. This avatar cannot tolerate light.

Lovecraft suggests that the fake Henry Akeley that appears at the end of &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot; (1930) is also Nyarlathotep. In the story, the Mi-Go chant his name in reverential tones, stating &quot;To Nyarlathotep, Mighty Messenger, must all things be told. And he shall put on the semblance of man, the waxen mask and the robes that hide, and come down from the world of Seven Suns to mock.&quot; At the end of &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot;, the main character to his horror discovers a loose dressing gown and the dismembered head and arms of Akeley lying on the couch, presumed in the story to have been a Mi-Go in disguise. But due to the mention in the chant to Nyarlathotep wearing the &quot;waxen mask and the robes that hide&quot;, S. T. Joshi writes that &quot;this seems a clear allusion to Nyarlathotep disguised with Akeley&#x27;s face and hands; but if so, it means that at this time Nyarlathotep is, in bodily form, one of the fungi — especially if, as seems likely, Nyarlathotep is one of the two buzzing voices Albert Wilmarth overhears at the end.&quot; Joshi notes this is problematic, because &quot;if Nyarlathotep is (as critics have termed it) a &#x27;shapeshifter&#x27;, why would he have to don the face and hands of Akeley instead of merely reshaping himself as Akeley?&quot;

Though Nyarlathotep appears as a character in only four stories and two sonnets, his name is mentioned frequently in other works. In &quot;The Rats in the Walls&quot; (1924), Nyarlathotep is mentioned as a faceless god in the caverns of Earth&#x27;s center. In &quot;The Shadow Out of Time&quot; (1936), the &quot;hideous secret of Nyarlathotep&quot; is revealed to the protagonist by Khephnes during their imprisonment by the Great Race of Yith.

Nyarlathotep does not appear in Lovecraft&#x27;s story &quot;The Crawling Chaos&quot; (1920/21), despite the similarity of the title to the character&#x27;s epithet. Lovecraft wrote to a correspondent that he reused the phrase because he &quot;liked the sound of it&quot;.

=== Other appearances ===
Nyarlathotep has also appeared outside of Lovecraft&#x27;s own writings. The light novel and anime series &quot;Haiyore! Nyaruko-san&quot; (2009) is based on the Cthulhu mythos, with the main character Nyaruko directly referring to Nyarlathotep.

Nyarlathotep appears in the guise of the Dark Man in Larry Correia&#x27;s story &quot;Dead Waits Dreaming&quot; (2013).

Though he does not appear in Lovecraft&#x27;s original short story, Nyarlathotep in his &quot;Black Man&quot; form appears in the 1993 Caliber Comics adaption of &quot;The Music of Erich Zann&quot;, in flashbacks for the eponymous Erich Zann.

Alan Moore&#x27;s limited comic series &quot;Neonomicon&quot; (2010–2011) utilizes Nyarlathotep in the form of Johnny Carcosa, a masked drug dealer who frequents Cthulhu-themed clubs and occult shops. His manner of converting new followers is to place them in a vegetative state, susceptible to &quot;Aklo&quot;—words related to Lovecraft&#x27;s work, which alter the consciousness of those who listen to them. In Moore&#x27;s story, he serves the allegorical role of the Archangel Gabriel at the Annunciation, informing the protagonist that she has been impregnated and will soon give birth to Cthulhu. Carcosa takes a more active role in Moore&#x27;s follow-up volume &quot;Providence&quot;, &quot;rewarding&quot; the protagonist, Robert Black, for his work as the &quot;herald&quot; of H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s effects on the world and later overseeing the birth of Cthulhu.

In the video game &quot;Dusk&quot;, Nyarlathotep appears as the final enemy encounter. Instead of taking the form of a humanoid in the fight, however, he takes the form of a leviathan eldritch beast. How he has been worked into the plot is deliberately very vague, as he only appears at the very end, though it is clear that he was up to the trickery and manipulation of his past portrayals.

In the manga series &quot;Ghost Reaper Girl&quot; the head of the Eastern Branch is a woman called Nyarlathotep who uses the title &quot;The Chaos&quot;. She is a dark skinned woman, with the lower half of the eye of Horus below her right eye.

Nyarlathotep is featured in several of the &quot;Shin Megami Tensei&quot; video games, as well as the &quot;Persona&quot; spin-offs, including &quot;&quot; and also the &quot;Persona 2&quot; duology, in which he is the main antagonist. He showcases shape shifting abilities there, by donning several characters&#x27; appearances and when fought as &quot;himself&quot;, changes to a more unsettling and tentacled appearance. Although it can be noted that when defeated for the last time, he switches back to the human appearance of one of the playable characters.

In Charles Stross&#x27; series &quot;The Laundry Files&quot;, a human avatar of Nyarlathotep under the name Fabian Everyman becomes UK&#x27;s prime minister.

In the mobile video game &quot;Dragalia Lost&quot;, there is a dragon named Nyarlathotep who appears in the Accursed Archives raid event.

Nyarlathotep appears as a playable unit in the 2016 Japanese mobile game &quot;Tokyo Afterschool Summoners&quot;, where he is depicted as a popular DJ with a rep for causing chaos simply to cause chaos.

Nyarlathotep is the focus of an augmented reality game distributed by The Mysterious Package Company.

Nyarlathotep appears in the loosely-based &#x27;Azathoth Rising&#x27; by Joseph S. Dale, as the guardian of the Necronomicon, as he tries to make wizards and other people of power use the spells in the book ostensibly to gain power.

In the 2007 visual novel &quot;Shikkoku no Sharnoth: What a Beautiful Tomorrow&quot;, Nyarlathotep is revealed to be the true identity of the character simply named &#x27;the M&#x27;. The dimension of Sharnoth which is closely associated with Nyarlathotep also plays a significant part in the game&#x27;s story.

In the 2017 game &quot;Sundered&quot;, Nyarlathotep appears as the final boss, the god of a group of worshippers based on Lovecraftian mythology.

In the podcast &quot;Malevolent&quot; created by Harlan Guthrie, Nyarlathotep appears as an enigmatic, manic, unpredictable and dramatic antagonist. In the podcast he uses the name Kayne, but is later revealed to be Nyarlathotep.

Nyarlathotep makes an appearance in the 2022 video game Sucker for Love: First Date, as well as in its 2024 sequel, Sucker for Love: Date to Die For, as a character named Nyanlahotep, a female catgirl version of Nyarlathotep.

== Inspiration ==
In a 1921 letter to Reinhardt Kleiner, Lovecraft related the dream he had had—described as &quot;the most realistic and horrible [nightmare] I have experienced since the age of ten&quot;—that served as the basis for his prose poem &quot;Nyarlathotep&quot;. In the dream, he received a letter from his friend Samuel Loveman that read:

Don&#x27;t fail to see Nyarlathotep if he comes to Providence. He is horrible—horrible beyond anything you can imagine—but wonderful. He haunts one for hours afterwards. I am still shuddering at what he showed.

Lovecraft commented:

I had never heard the name NYARLATHOTEP before, but seemed to understand the allusion. Nyarlathotep was a kind of itinerant showman or lecturer who held forth in public halls and aroused widespread fear and discussion with his exhibitions. These exhibitions consisted of two parts—first, a horrible—possibly prophetic—cinema reel; and later some extraordinary experiments with scientific and electrical apparatus. As I received the letter, I seemed to recall that Nyarlathotep was already in Providence... I seemed to remember that persons had whispered to me in awe of his horrors, and warned me not to go near him. But Loveman&#x27;s dream letter decided me... As I left the house I saw throngs of men plodding through the night, all whispering affrightedly and bound in one direction. I fell in with them, afraid yet eager to see and hear the great, the obscure, the unutterable Nyarlathotep.

Will Murray has speculated that this dream image of Nyarlathotep may have been inspired by the inventor Nikola Tesla, whose well-attended lectures did involve extraordinary experiments with electrical apparatus and whom some saw as a sinister figure.

Robert M. Price proposes that the name Nyarlathotep may have been subconsciously suggested to Lovecraft by two names from Lord Dunsany, an author he much admired. Alhireth-Hotep, a false prophet, appears in Dunsany&#x27;s &quot;The Gods of Pegana&quot;, and Mynarthitep, a god described as &quot;angry&quot;, appears in Dunsany&#x27;s &quot;The Sorrow of Search&quot;.

== Summary ==
Nyarlathotep differs from the other beings in a number of ways. Most of them are exiled to stars, like Yog-Sothoth and Hastur, or sleeping and dreaming like Cthulhu; Nyarlathotep, however, is active and frequently walks the Earth in the guise of a human being, usually a tall, slim, joyous man. He has &quot;a thousand&quot; other forms, most of these reputed to be maddeningly horrific. Most of the Outer Gods have their own cults serving them; Nyarlathotep seems to serve these cults and take care of the deities&#x27; affairs in their absence. Most of the gods use strange alien languages, but Nyarlathotep uses human languages and can be mistaken for a human being. The other Outer Gods and Great Old Ones are often described as mindless or unfathomable rather than truly malevolent, but Nyarlathotep delights in cruelty, is deceptive and manipulative, and even cultivates followers and uses propaganda to achieve his goals.

Nyarlathotep enacts the will of the Outer Gods, and is their messenger, heart and soul; he is also a servant of Azathoth, his father, whose wishes he immediately fulfills. Unlike the other Outer Gods, causing madness is more important and enjoyable than death and destruction to Nyarlathotep. It is suggested by some that he will destroy the human race and possibly the Earth as well.

Nyarlathotep is an immensely powerful being, as he is able take anything to the throne of Azathoth, which is at the center of Ultimate Chaos. He also envelops the world in darkness and causes waves of destruction to emanate from &quot;ultimate space&quot;, and he also causes groups of people to go insane. Nyarlathotep also knows the truths and futures of things that are incomprehensible to the human mind.

<text>QNX ( or ) is a commercial Unix-like real-time operating system, aimed primarily at the embedded systems market.

The product was originally developed in the early 1980s by Canadian company Quantum Software Systems, founded March 30, 1980, and later renamed QNX Software Systems.

, it is used in a variety of devices including automobiles, medical devices, program logic controllers, automated manufacturing, trains, and more.

== History ==
Gordon Bell and Dan Dodge, both students at the University of Waterloo in 1980, took a course in real-time operating systems, in which the students constructed a basic real-time microkernel and user programs. Both were convinced there was a commercial need for such a system, and moved to the high-tech planned community Kanata, Ontario, to start Quantum Software Systems that year. In 1982, the first version of QUNIX was released for the Intel 8088 CPU. In 1984, Quantum Software Systems renamed QUNIX to QNX in an effort to avoid any trademark infringement challenges.

One of the first widespread uses of the QNX real-time OS (RTOS) was in the nonembedded world when it was selected as the operating system for the Ontario education system&#x27;s own computer design, the Unisys ICON. Over the years QNX was used mostly for larger projects, as its 44k kernel was too large to fit inside the one-chip computers of the era. The system garnered a reputation for reliability and became used in running machinery in many industrial applications.

In the late-1980s, Quantum realized that the market was rapidly moving towards the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) model and decided to rewrite the kernel to be much more compatible at a low level. The result was QNX 4. During this time Patrick Hayden, while working as an intern, along with Robin Burgener (a full-time employee at the time), developed a new windowing system. This patented concept was developed into the embeddable graphical user interface (GUI) named the QNX Photon microGUI. QNX also provided a version of the X Window System.

To demonstrate the OS&#x27;s capability and relatively small size, in the late 1990s QNX released a demo image that included the POSIX-compliant QNX 4 OS, a full graphical user interface, graphical text editor, TCP/IP networking, web browser and web server that all fit on a bootable 1.44 MB floppy disk for the 386 PC.

Toward the end of the 1990s, the company, then named QNX Software Systems, began work on a new version of QNX, designed from the ground up to be symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) capable, and to support all current POSIX application programming interfaces (APIs) and any new POSIX APIs that could be anticipated while still retaining the microkernel architecture. This resulted in QNX Neutrino, released in 2001.

Along with the Neutrino kernel, QNX Software Systems became a founding member of the Eclipse (integrated development environment) consortium. The company released a suite of Eclipse plug-ins packaged with the Eclipse workbench in 2002, and named QNX Momentics Tool Suite.

In 2004, the company announced it had been sold to Harman International Industries. Before this acquisition, QNX software was already widely used in the automotive industry for telematics systems. Since the purchase by Harman, QNX software has been designed into over 200 different automobile makes and models, in telematics systems, and in infotainment and navigation units. The QNX CAR Application Platform was running in over 20 million vehicles as of mid-2011. The company has since released several middleware products including the QNX Aviage Multimedia Suite, the QNX Aviage Acoustic Processing Suite and the QNX HMI Suite.

The microkernels of Cisco Systems&#x27; IOS-XR (ultra high availability IOS, introduced 2004) and IOS Software Modularity (introduced 2006) were based on QNX. IOS Software Modularity never gained traction and was limited only to small run for Catalyst 6500, while IOS XR moved to Linux as of release 6.x.

In September 2007, QNX Software Systems announced the availability of some of its source code.

On April 9, 2010, Research In Motion (later renamed to BlackBerry Limited) announced they would acquire QNX Software Systems from Harman International Industries. On the same day, QNX source code access was restricted from the public and hobbyists.

In September 2010, the company announced a tablet computer, the BlackBerry PlayBook, and a new operating system BlackBerry Tablet OS based on QNX to run on the tablet.

On October 18, 2011, Research In Motion announced &quot;BBX&quot;, which was later renamed &quot;BlackBerry 10&quot;, in December 2011. Blackberry 10 devices build upon the BlackBerry PlayBook QNX based operating system for touch devices, but adapt the user interface for smartphones using the Qt based Cascades Native User-Interface framework.

At the Geneva Motor Show, Apple demonstrated CarPlay which provides an iOS-like user interface to head units in compatible vehicles. Once configured by the automaker, QNX can be programmed to hand off its display and some functions to an Apple CarPlay device.

On December 11, 2014, Ford Motor Company stated that it would replace Microsoft Auto with QNX.

In January 2017, QNX announced the upcoming release of its SDP 7.0, with support for Intel and ARM 32- and 64-bit platforms, and support for C++14. It was released in March 2017.

In December 2023, QNX released QNX SDP 8.0 which is powered by a next generation microkernel with support for the latest Intel and ARM [v8 and v9] 64 bit platforms, GCC12 based toolchain and a QNX toolkit for Visual Studio Code.

== Technology ==

As a microkernel-based OS, QNX is based on the idea of running most of the operating system kernel in the form of a number of small tasks, named Resource Managers. This differs from the more traditional monolithic kernel, in which the operating system kernel is one very large program composed of a huge number of parts, with special abilities. In the case of QNX, the use of a microkernel allows users (developers) to turn off any functions they do not need without having to change the OS. Instead, such services will simply not run.

The QNX kernel, codice_1 (also name of the binary executable program for the QNX Neutrino (&#x27;nto&#x27;) process (&#x27;proc&#x27;) itself), contains only CPU scheduling, interprocess communication, interrupt redirection and timers. Everything else runs as a user process, including a special process known as codice_2 which performs process creation and memory management by operating in conjunction with the microkernel. This is made possible by two key mechanisms: subroutine-call type interprocess communication, and a boot loader which can load an image containing the kernel and any desired set of user programs and shared libraries. There are no device drivers in the kernel. The network stack is based on NetBSD code. Along with its support for its own, native, device drivers, QNX supports its legacy, &quot;io-net manager&quot; server, and the network drivers ported from NetBSD.

QNX interprocess communication consists of sending a message from one process to another and waiting for a reply. This is a single operation, called codice_3. The message is copied, by the kernel, from the address space of the sending process to that of the receiving process. If the receiving process is waiting for the message, control of the CPU is transferred at the same time, without a pass through the CPU scheduler. Thus, sending a message to another process and waiting for a reply does not result in &quot;losing one&#x27;s turn&quot; for the CPU. This tight integration between message passing and CPU scheduling is one of the key mechanisms that makes QNX message passing broadly usable. Most Unix and Linux interprocess communication mechanisms lack this tight integration, although a user space implementation of QNX-type messaging for Linux does exist. Mishandling of this subtle issue is a primary reason for the disappointing performance of some other microkernel systems such as early versions of Mach. The recipient process need not be on the same physical machine.

All I/O operations, file system operations, and network operations were meant to work through this mechanism, and the data transferred was copied during message passing. Later versions of QNX reduce the number of separate processes and integrate the network stack and other function blocks into single applications for performance reasons.

Message handling is prioritized by thread priority. Since I/O requests are performed using message passing, high priority threads receive I/O service before low priority threads, an essential feature in a hard real-time system.

The boot loader is the other key component of the minimal microkernel system. Because user programs can be built into the boot image, the set of device drivers and support libraries needed for startup need not be, and are not, in the kernel. Even such functions as program loading are not in the kernel, but instead are in shared user-space libraries loaded as part of the boot image. It is possible to put an entire boot image into ROM, which is used for diskless embedded systems.

Neutrino supports symmetric multiprocessing and processor affinity, called bound multiprocessing (BMP) in QNX terminology. BMP is used to improve cache hitting and to ease the migration of non-SMP safe applications to multi-processor computers.

Neutrino supports strict priority-preemptive scheduling and adaptive partition scheduling (APS). APS guarantees minimum CPU percentages to selected groups of threads, even though others may have higher priority. The adaptive partition scheduler is still strictly priority-preemptive when the system is underloaded. It can also be configured to run a selected set of critical threads strictly real time, even when the system is overloaded.

The QNX operating system also contained a web browser known as &#x27;Voyager&#x27;.

Due to its microkernel architecture QNX is also a distributed operating system. Dan Dodge and Peter van der Veen hold based on the QNX operating system&#x27;s distributed processing features known commercially as Transparent Distributed Processing. This allows the QNX kernels on separate devices to access each other&#x27;s system services using effectively the same communication mechanism as is used to access local services.

== Uses ==

The BlackBerry PlayBook tablet computer designed by BlackBerry uses a version of QNX as the primary operating system. The BlackBerry 10 operating system is also based on QNX.

QNX is also used in car infotainment systems with many major car makers offering variants that include an embedded QNX architecture. It is supported by popular SSL/TLS libraries such as wolfSSL.

Since the introduction of its &quot;Safe Kernel 1.0&quot; in 2010, QNX was projected and used subsequently in automated drive or ADAS systems for automotive projects that require a functional safety certified RTOS. QNX provides this with its QNX OS for Safety products.

QNX Neutrino (2001) has been ported to a number of platforms and now runs on practically any modern central processing unit (CPU) family that is used in the embedded market. This includes the PowerPC, x86, MIPS, SH-4, and the closely interrelated group of ARM, StrongARM, and XScale.

As of June 26, 2023, QNX software is now embedded in over 255 million vehicles worldwide, including most leading OEMs and Tier 1s, such as BMW, Bosch, Continental, Dongfeng Motor, Geely, Ford, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Subaru, Toyota, Volkswagen, Volvo, and more.

== Licensing ==
On Jan 06, 2005, QNX made its software development platform available for non-commercial use.

QNX offers a license for noncommercial and academic users. In January 2024, BlackBerry introduced QNX Everywhere to make QNX more accessible to Hobbyists. QNX Everywhere was made publicly accessible in early 2024.

== Community ==

* &quot;OpenQNX&quot; is a QNX Community Portal established and run independently. An IRC channel and Newsgroups access via web is available. Diverse industries are represented by the developers on the site.
* &quot;Foundry27&quot; is a web-based QNX community established by the company. It serves as a hub to QNX Neutrino development where developers can register, choose the license, and get the source code and related toolkit of the RTOS.
