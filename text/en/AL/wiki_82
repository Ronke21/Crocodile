<text>Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree (17 December 1852 – 2 July 1917) was an English actor and theatre manager.

Tree began performing in the 1870s. By 1887, he was managing the Haymarket Theatre in the West End, winning praise for adventurous programming and lavish productions, and starring in many of its productions. In 1899, he helped fund the rebuilding, and became manager, of His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre. Again, he promoted a mix of Shakespeare and classic plays with new works and adaptations of popular novels, giving them spectacular productions in this large house, and often playing leading roles. His wife, actress Helen Maud Holt, often played opposite him and assisted him with management of the theatres.

Although Tree was regarded as a versatile and skilled actor, particularly in character roles, by his later years his technique was seen as mannered and old-fashioned. He founded the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in 1904 and was knighted for his contributions to theatre in 1909. His famous family includes his siblings, explorer Julius Beerbohm, author Constance Beerbohm and half-brother caricaturist Max Beerbohm. His daughters were Viola, an actress, Felicity, a socialite and Iris, a poet. His illegitimate children included film director Carol Reed. He was a grandfather of the actor Oliver Reed.

==Early life and career==
Born in Kensington, London as Herbert Draper Beerbohm, Tree was the second son and second child of Julius Ewald Edward Beerbohm (1810–1892) and his wife Constantia () Beerbohm. The senior Beerbohm was of Lithuanian origin; he had come to the United Kingdom in about 1830 and set up and prospered as a cereal merchant. Draper was an Englishwoman. They had four children. Tree&#x27;s younger brother was the author and explorer Julius Beerbohm, and his sister was author Constance Beerbohm. A younger half-brother was the parodist and caricaturist Max Beerbohm, born from their father&#x27;s second marriage. Max jokingly claimed that Herbert added the &quot;Tree&quot; to his name because it was easier for audiences than shouting &quot;Beerbohm! Beerbohm!&quot; at curtain calls. The latter part of his surname, &quot;bohm&quot;, is north German dialect for &quot;tree&quot;.

Tree&#x27;s early education included Mrs Adams&#x27;s Preparatory School at Frant, East Sussex, Dr Stone&#x27;s school in King&#x27;s Square, Bristol, and Westbourne Collegiate School in Westbourne Grove, London. After these, he attended the Salzmann Schnepfenthal School in Thuringia, Germany, where his father had been educated. Upon his return to England, he began performing with amateur troupes, eventually using the name Herbert Beerbohm Tree, while working in his father&#x27;s business.

==Actor==
In 1878, Tree played Grimaldi in Dion Boucicault&#x27;s &quot;The Life of an Actress&quot; at the Globe Theatre; shortly after, he began his professional career. For the next six years, he performed mainly on tour in the British provinces, playing character roles. He made his London debut late in 1878 at the Olympic Theatre under the management of Henry Neville. His first real success was as the elderly Marquis de Pontsablé in &quot;Madame Favart&quot;, in which he toured towards the end of 1879. Another London engagement was as Prince Maleotti in a revival of &quot;Forget-me-Not&quot; at the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Theatre in 1880.

His first London success came in 1884 as the Rev. Robert Spalding in Charles Hawtrey&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;The Private Secretary.&quot; Tree embellished the comic elements of the role, which added to the popularity of the play. His next role was Paolo Marcari in &quot;Called Back&quot; by Hugh Conway. The contrast between this dashing Italian spy and his timid parson in Hawtrey&#x27;s play, showed his versatility as a character actor. Other appearances over the next two years included roles in revivals of A. W. Pinero&#x27;s &quot;The Magistrate&quot; and W. S. Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;Engaged&quot;. In 1886, he played Iago in &quot;Othello&quot; and Sir Peter Teazle in &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; with F. R. Benson&#x27;s company at Bournemouth. The same year, in London, he made a success at the Haymarket Theatre, in the character role of Baron Harzfeld in &quot;Jim the Penman&quot; by Charles Young.

==Theatre manager and leading roles==

In 1887, at age thirty-four, Tree took over the management of the Comedy Theatre in the West End of London. His first production was a successful run of the Russian revolutionary play &quot;The Red Lamp&quot; by W. Outram Tristram, in which Tree took the role of Demetrius.

Later in the year, he became the manager of the prestigious Haymarket Theatre. Since the departure of the Bancrofts in 1885, that theatre&#x27;s reputation had suffered. Tree restored it during his tenure. He produced and appeared on stage in some thirty plays during the following decade. While popular farces and melodramas like &quot;Trilby&quot; anchored the repertoire (the production ran for an extraordinary 260 performances), Tree also encouraged the new drama, staging Maeterlinck&#x27;s &quot;The Intruder&quot; (1890), Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;An Enemy of the People&quot; (1893) and Wilde&#x27;s &quot;A Woman of No Importance&quot; (1893), among others. He supported new playwrights by producing special &quot;Monday night&quot; performances of their new plays.

Tree also mounted critically acclaimed productions of &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1892), &quot;Henry IV, Part 1&quot; (1896) and &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot; (1889), establishing himself as a Shakespearean leading man. &quot;The Times&quot; thought his Hamlet a &quot;notable success&quot;, but not everyone agreed: W. S. Gilbert said of it, &quot;I never saw anything so funny in my life, and yet it was not in the least vulgar.&quot; His Haymarket seasons were broken by visits to the United States in January 1895 and November 1896, and occasional visits to the provinces.

With the profits he had accumulated at the Haymarket, Tree helped finance the rebuilding of Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in grand Louis XV style. He owned and managed it. He lived in the theatre for two decades following its completion in 1897 until his death in 1917. For his personal use, he had a banqueting hall and living room installed in the massive, central, square French-style dome. The theatre historian W. J. MacQueen-Pope, wrote of the theatre, 
Simply to go to His Majesty&#x27;s was a thrill. As soon as you entered it, you sensed the atmosphere ... In Tree&#x27;s time it was graced by footmen in powdered wigs and liveries ... Everything was in tone, nothing cheap, nothing vulgar.Tree opened his theatre in 1897 during Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee year, associating the new structure with an imperial celebration.

Over the next two decades, Tree staged approximately sixty plays there, programming a repertory at least as varied as he had at the Haymarket. His first production at Her Majesty&#x27;s was a dramatisation of Gilbert Parker&#x27;s &quot;The Seats of the Mighty&quot;. Tree mounted new plays by prominent British playwrights, such as &quot;Carnac Sahib&quot; (1899) by Henry Arthur Jones. His productions were exceptionally profitable; they were famous, most of all, for their elaborate and often spectacular scenery and effects. Unlike some other famous actor-managers, Tree engaged the best actors available to join his company and hired the best designers and composers for the plays with incidental music. His productions starred such noted actors as Constance Collier, Ellen Terry, Madge Kendal, Winifred Emery, Julia Neilson, Violet Vanbrugh, Oscar Asche, Arthur Bourchier, and Lewis Waller.

Tree often starred in the theatre&#x27;s dramatisations of popular nineteenth-century novels, such as Sydney Grundy&#x27;s adaptation of Dumas&#x27;s &quot;Musketeers&quot; (1898); Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;Resurrection&quot; (1903); Dickens&#x27;s &quot;Oliver Twist&quot; (1905), &quot;The Mystery of Edwin Drood&quot; (1908) and &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1914); and Morton&#x27;s dramatisation of Thackeray&#x27;s &quot;The Newcomes&quot;, called &quot;Colonel Newcome&quot; (1906), among others. Tree staged many contemporary verse dramas by Stephen Phillips and others, including &quot;Herod&quot; (1900), &quot;Ulysses&quot; (1902), &quot;Nero&quot; (1906) and &quot;Faust&quot; (1908). Adaptations of classic foreign plays included &quot;Beethoven&quot; by Louis Parker, an adaptation of the play by René Fauchois (1909); &quot;A Russian Tragedy&quot;, an English version by Henry Hamilton of the play by Adolph Glass (1909); and &quot;The Perfect Gentleman&quot; by W. Somerset Maugham, an adaptation of the classic Molière play, &quot;Le bourgeois gentilhomme&quot; (1913). The classical repertory included such works as &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; (1909). Tree also programmed popular melodramas, farces, romantic comedies and premieres, such as Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, in 1914. Tree played Henry Higgins opposite the Eliza of Mrs Patrick Campbell. The actor John Gielgud wrote, &quot;Rehearsing &quot;Pygmalion&quot; with Tree she must have been impossible. They were both such eccentrics. They kept ordering each other out of the theatre with Shaw in the middle, trying to cope with them.&quot; Tree also took his productions on tour to the United States many times. In 1907 he visited Berlin&#x27;s Royal Opera House at the invitation of Kaiser Wilhelm II. Gilbert remarked that Tree had been invited by the Kaiser &quot;with the malignant motive of showing the Germans what impostors we all are.&quot;

==Shakespeare==

Under Tree, however, Her (later His) Majesty&#x27;s Theatre was most famous for its work with Shakespeare, building an international reputation as the premier British playhouse for his works during the Edwardian era, which had for so long belonged to Henry Irving at the Lyceum Theatre during the Victorian period. Tree worked untiringly to make Shakespeare popular with the theatregoing public. He mounted sixteen Shakespeare productions, many of which earned enough success to justify revivals during subsequent seasons. He also established an annual Shakespeare festival from 1905 to 1913 that showcased a total over two hundred performances by his company and other acting troupes. Tree overturned the popular wisdom at the time that Shakespeare productions would lose money, creating stagings that appealed widely to patrons. In fact, the theatre&#x27;s first Shakespearian play, &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, was its first commercial success in 1898, running for 165 consecutive performances and selling 242,000 tickets. The next two years saw two more hits, &quot;King John&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Tree&#x27;s longest-running revival, &quot;Henry VIII&quot;, ran for a sensational 254 consecutive performances from 1 September 1910 to 8 April 1911. Many of the others were similar hits.

Tree staged the Shakespeare plays, in particular, to appeal to the broad public taste for realistic scenery and scenic effects and lavish spectacle, mirroring the Edwardian fashion for luxury and extravagance. For example, in &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; (1906), there was a woodland glade with a shepherd&#x27;s cottage and babbling brook; in &quot;The Tempest&quot; (1904), a replica of a sixteenth-century vessel was tossed in a storm; in &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; (1908), he recreated an authentic Renaissance ghetto. Tree expounded his views on staging in 1897:

Tree sometimes interpolated scenes of famous historical events into the plays to provide even more spectacle, such as King John&#x27;s granting of Magna Carta or Anne Boleyn&#x27;s coronation in Westminster Abbey.

Tree also pursued four Shakespeare film projects during his career at Her Majesty&#x27;s. Of great historical interest is the filming, in 1899, of three brief segments from his production of &quot;King John&quot;, in which he starred and directed. This is the first film record of a Shakespeare play. Charles Urban filmed the opening shipwreck from the 1904 revival of &quot;The Tempest&quot; at the theatre in 1905; Tree, whose role in the production was Caliban, did not appear in this scene. Tree played Cardinal Wolsey in a 1911 studio film by William Barker of a five-scene version of &quot;Henry VIII&quot;, based on the theatre&#x27;s 1910 production. Tree was paid the unprecedented sum of £1,000 lest the film prove unsatisfactory, or damage ticket sales of the theatre presentation. Filming took place at studios in Ealing, west London and took only one day, thanks to careful preparation beforehand. The film was presented to the public on 27 February 1911 in various theatres in London and in the provinces, and was a huge success. &quot;The Moving Picture World&quot; wrote, &quot;The picture is without doubt the greatest that has even been attempted in this country, and I am almost tempted to say in any other ... the acting passes anything ever seen in moving pictures before... The effect on the moving picture industry here will be enormous.&quot; In California in 1916, Tree played the title role in a film of &quot;Macbeth&quot;, by D. W. Griffith (considered a lost film).

==Reputation and last years==

According to Tree&#x27;s biographers, critics and audiences considered Tree to be the best character actor of his day. He himself detested the term &quot;character actor&quot;, saying: 
All acting should be character acting. What is Shylock? A character part. What are Macbeth and Richard III but character parts? What are Hamlet, Iago, or Othello but character parts? What are Brutus, Mark Antony and Cassius? Such characters as Romeo of course require the appearance of youth and those graces of person which will alone commend the Mantuan lover to his Juliet. But even here, an audience will be more moved by the intellectual suggestion of a Jean de Reszke, than by the inadequate posturings of a youthful nincompoop.

He was an exceptional mime and demonstrated unrivalled versatility in creating individual characterisations. He was particularly praised for his vivid characters with eccentric and idiosyncratic and habits, including Fagin, Falstaff and Svengali. His diligent preparation and attention to detail in make-up, gesture, body position and facial expression allowed him to inhabit these roles. He used his expressive eyes to project such varied emotions as &quot;the dreamy languor of Hamlet during his moments of reflection and the baleful hatred of Shylock towards his persecutors to the nervous fear of Richard II during his surrender at Flint Castle. His Malvolio was a swaggering and conceited fool, King John a superstitious and deceitful coward, and Macbeth a neurotic and self-torturing monarch.&quot; The literary critic Desmond MacCarthy wrote of Tree: &quot;He could make himself look like Falstaff. He understood and revelled in the character of Falstaff, but his performance lacked fundamental force. Hence the contradiction in his acting: his performance as a whole often fell short of high excellence, yet these same impersonations were lit by insight and masterly strokes of interpretation, which made the spectator feel that he was watching the performance of the most imaginative of living actors.&quot;

In the great tragic Shakespearean roles, however, Tree was overshadowed by earlier actors such as Henry Irving. During performance, Tree allowed inspiration to suggest to him appropriate stage business, which sometimes lead to inconsistent interpretations in his portrayals of a role. &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; wrote, &quot;The wonderful thing about him was his amazing versatility, and there was an intellectual virility, an untiring earnestness about the man, which was irresistibly stimulating.&quot; Tree&#x27;s versatility, however, was a two edged sword: he quickly tired of characters after a brief run and sought to add business and details to the part to sustain his interest, which led to further character inconsistencies in long runs. Tree&#x27;s voice was described as thin, and he was sometimes criticised for struggling to project it in a manner that made his performance seem unnatural. In the last decade of his career, Tree&#x27;s technique was seen as mannered and old fashioned. His spectacles, too, in comparison with the experimental methods of Poel and other producers, seemed outdated, although Tree responded to his critics by noting that his productions remained profitable and well attended.

==Personal life ==

Tree married actress Helen Maud Holt (1863–1937) in 1882; she often played opposite him and assisted him with management of the theatres. Her charm also assisted the couple&#x27;s entry into prominent social and élite artistic and intellectual circles. Their daughters were actresses Viola Tree (who married theatre critic Alan Parsons) and Felicity Tree (who married Sir Geoffrey Cory-Wright, third baronet) and poet Iris Tree (who married Curtis Moffat, becoming Countess Ledebur). Tree also fathered several illegitimate children (six with Beatrice May Pinney), including film director Carol Reed and Peter Reed, father of the British actor Oliver Reed. He was also the grandfather of Hollywood screenwriter and producer Ivan Moffat.

Tree founded the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) in 1904. He also served as president of the Theatrical Managers&#x27; Association and assisted the Actors&#x27; Benevolent Fund and the Actors&#x27; Association. For his contributions to theatre, he was knighted in 1909. During World War I, Tree contributed his celebrity by delivering patriotic addresses. He wrote several books discussing the importance of the theatre and the arts in modern society.

Tree&#x27;s last professional undertaking was a visit to Los Angeles in 1915 fulfilling a contract with a film company. He was in America for the greater part of 1915 and 1916. He returned to England in 1917 and died, aged 64, from pulmonary blood clots. According to writer Vera Brittain, he died suddenly in the arms of her friend, the novelist Winifred Holtby, then aged 19 and working as a nursing assistant at a fashionable London nursing home where Tree was recuperating from surgery to repair a broken leg. His remains were cremated, and his ashes are buried at the additional burial ground of St John-at-Hampstead church.

<text>Brigadoon is a musical with book and lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner and score by Frederick Loewe. The plot features two American tourists who stumble upon Brigadoon, a mysterious Scottish village that appears for only one day every 100 years; one tourist soon falls in love with a young woman from Brigadoon. The show&#x27;s song &quot;Almost Like Being in Love&quot; subsequently became a standard.

The original production opened at the Ziegfeld Theatre on Broadway in 1947 and ran for 581 performances, starring David Brooks, Marion Bell, Pamela Britton, and Lee Sullivan. &quot;Brigadoon&quot; opened at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in the West End in 1949 and ran for 685 performances; many revivals have followed. The 1954 film adaptation starred Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse, while the 1966 television version starred Robert Goulet, Sally Ann Howes, and Peter Falk.

==Background==
Lyricist and book writer Alan Jay Lerner and composer Frederick Loewe had previously collaborated on three musicals; the first, &quot;Life of the Party&quot;, closed during pre-Broadway tryouts, and the second and third, &quot;What&#x27;s Up?&quot; and &quot;The Day Before Spring&quot;, had met with moderate success. Inspired by Rodgers and Hammerstein&#x27;s successful collaborations &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; and &quot;Carousel&quot;, they created &quot;Brigadoon&quot;, about a magical village in the Scottish highlands.

Like &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; and &quot;Carousel&quot;, &quot;Brigadoon&quot; included a serious love story as the main plot and a lighter romance as subplot. Thematically, the musical depicted the contrast between empty city life and the warmth and simplicity of the country, focusing on a theme of love transcending time. Agnes de Mille, who had previously choreographed &quot;Oklahoma!&quot; and &quot;Carousel&quot;, was hired as choreographer, and her work for &quot;Brigadoon&quot; incorporated elements of traditional Scottish folk dance: a traditional sword dance, a chase scene, and a funeral dance.

Though Lerner and Loewe originally took &quot;Brigadoon&quot; to producer Billy Rose, Cheryl Crawford was the producer who actually brought &quot;Brigadoon&quot; to Broadway. Lerner explained the change in producer by saying: &quot;The contract which [Billy Rose] wished us to sign negated Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Emancipation Proclamation that freed the slaves.&quot; Under Loewe&#x27;s guidance, Ted Royal received a sole orchestrator credit for his work on the original production. His atmospheric arrangements have been frequently used for the revivals.

Though the Highland village of Brigadoon is fictional, it is named after the (Lowland) Brig o&#x27; Doon, a bridge located south of Alloway, Ayrshire, Scotland, which is the setting for the final verse of Robert Burns&#x27;s poem &quot;Tam o&#x27; Shanter&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; theater critic George Jean Nathan wrote that Lerner&#x27;s book was based on a German story, published in 1860 by Friedrich Gerstäcker, later translated by Charles Brandon Schaeffer, about the mythical village of Germelshausen that fell under a magic curse. However, Lerner denied that he had based the book on an older story, and, in an explanation published in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, stated that he did not learn of the existence of the Germelshausen story until after he had completed the first draft of &quot;Brigadoon&quot;. Lerner said that in his subsequent research, he found many other legends of disappearing towns in various countries&#x27; folklore, and he pronounced their similarities &quot;unconscious coincidence&quot;.

==Plot==
===Act I===
New Yorkers Tommy Albright and Jeff Douglas have travelled to the Scottish Highlands on a game-hunting vacation, but they get lost on their first night out. They begin to hear music (&quot;Brigadoon&quot;) coming from a nearby village that does not appear on their map of the area. They head over there to get directions back to their inn and find a fair in progress (&quot;McConnachy Square&quot;), with villagers dressed in traditional Scottish tartan. Andrew MacLaren and his daughters arrive at the fair to purchase supplies for younger daughter Jean&#x27;s wedding to Charlie Dalrymple. Archie Beaton&#x27;s son Harry madly loves Jean and is depressed at the thought of her marrying another, unable to find comfort in Maggie Anderson&#x27;s devotion to him. One of the girls asks Jean&#x27;s older sister Fiona when she&#x27;ll marry, and Fiona answers she&#x27;s waiting for the right person (&quot;Waitin&#x27; for My Dearie&quot;).

Tommy and Jeff wander into the village and ask where they are; Archie informs them that they are in &quot;Brigadoon&quot;. Fiona invites the wanderers to have a meal and rest at the MacLaren home. Flirtatious dairymaid Meg Brockie immediately falls for Jeff and leads him off. Charlie Dalrymple appears, rejoicing in his impending nuptials. He shares a drink with Tommy, toasting to a Mr. Forsythe whom he thanks for &quot;postponing the miracle&quot;. When Tommy asks what that means, Fiona shushes him and leads him away as Charlie celebrates the end of his bachelorhood (&quot;Go Home with Bonnie Jean&quot;). Tommy tells Fiona that he has a fiancée, Jane, in New York, but he&#x27;s in no hurry to marry her, and Fiona reveals that she likes Tommy very much. Tommy insists on accompanying Fiona to gather heather for the wedding (&quot;The Heather on the Hill&quot;). Meanwhile, Meg takes Jeff to a place in the forest with a shack and a cot. She tells him she&#x27;s &quot;highly attracted&quot; to him, but he spurns her advances, wanting only to sleep. She reflects on her &quot;eventful&quot; love life (&quot;The Love of My Life&quot;).

At the MacLarens&#x27;, Jean&#x27;s friends help her pack her things to move into Charlie&#x27;s home (&quot;Jeannie&#x27;s Packin&#x27; Up&quot;). Charlie arrives to sign the MacLarens&#x27; family Bible. He wants to see Jean; told that it&#x27;s bad luck to see her on the wedding day, he begs for her to come out anyway (&quot;Come to Me, Bend to Me&quot;). Tommy and Fiona return with a basket full of heather, and Fiona goes upstairs to help Jean dress for the wedding. Jeff arrives wearing a pair of Highland trews (trousers); apparently his own pants have been damaged on a &quot;thistle&quot;. Jeff finds that Tommy is so happy that he can barely contain it (&quot;Almost Like Being in Love&quot;). Tommy notices that all the events listed in the family Bible, including Jean&#x27;s wedding, are listed as if they had happened 200 years earlier. When he asks Fiona about this, she sends him to the schoolmaster, Mr. Lundie.

Fiona, Tommy, and Jeff arrive at Mr. Lundie&#x27;s home, where he relates a story that the two New Yorkers can hardly believe: to protect Brigadoon from being changed by the outside world, 200 years ago the local minister prayed to God to have Brigadoon disappear, only to reappear for one day every 100 years. All citizens of Brigadoon are forbidden to leave the town, or it will disappear forever. Tommy asks hypothetically if an outsider could be permitted to stay. Mr. Lundie replies, &quot;A stranger can stay if he loves someone here – not jus&#x27; Brigadoon, mind ye, but someone in Brigadoon – enough to want to give up everythin&#x27; an&#x27; stay with that one person. Which is how it should be. &#x27;Cause after all, lad, if ye love someone deeply, anythin&#x27; is possible.&quot;

The group leaves to go to the wedding, which opens with the clans coming in from the hills. Mr. Lundie marries Charlie and Jean, and they perform a traditional celebratory wedding dance. Sword dancers appear, led by Harry, and they perform an elaborate dance over their weapons. All the town joins in the dance, but it abruptly halts when Jean screams as Harry tries to kiss her. In anguish over Jean&#x27;s wedding, he announces that he&#x27;s leaving the town (which would end the miracle, causing Brigadoon to disappear forever into the Highland mists) and sprints away.

===Act II===
The men of the town, including Tommy and a reluctant Jeff, frantically try to find Harry before he can depart the town (&quot;The Chase&quot;). Suddenly an agonized scream is heard. Harry, who appears to have fallen on a rock and crushed his skull, is found dead by the other men. Deciding not to tell the rest of the town until the next morning, the men carry Harry&#x27;s body away. Fiona and her father arrive to see if everything is all right. As Mr. MacLaren leaves, Tommy sees Fiona, and they embrace. She reveals her love for him, and he tells her he believes he feels the same way (&quot;There But For You Go I&quot;). Fiona reminds him that the end of the day is near, and Tommy tells her he wants to stay in Brigadoon with her. They go to find Mr. Lundie.

Meanwhile, in the village, Meg tells about the day her parents were drunkenly married (&quot;My Mother&#x27;s Wedding Day&quot;), and the townsfolk dance until the sound of Highland pipes pierces the air. The gaiety is interrupted as Archie Beaton enters carrying Harry&#x27;s body, led by the pipers playing a lament. Maggie, who loved Harry, performs a funeral dance for her unrequited love. The men of Brigadoon help Archie carry his son to the burial place.

Tommy finds Jeff and announces his intention to stay. Jeff thinks the idea is absurd and argues with Tommy until he has convinced him that Brigadoon is only a dream. Jeff also reveals that he tripped Harry and accidentally killed him. Fiona and Mr. Lundie arrive, and Tommy, shaken by Jeff&#x27;s confession, tells Fiona that he loves her, but he can&#x27;t stay; he still has doubts (&quot;From This Day On&quot;). Fiona tells Tommy, as she fades away into darkness, that she will love him forever.

Four months later, Jeff is drinking heavily at a hotel bar in New York. Tommy, who has been living on a farm in New Hampshire, enters and greets Jeff, but is still in love with Fiona and cannot stop thinking about her. His fiancée Jane Ashton, a beautiful socialite, talks to him about their impending wedding, but everything she says causes him to hear Fiona&#x27;s voice and dream of Brigadoon (&quot;Come to Me, Bend to Me&quot; (reprise) and &quot;Heather on the Hill&quot; (reprise)). Tommy tells Jane that he cannot marry her, and she argues with him, but he continues to daydream about his true love (&quot;Go Home With Bonnie Jean&quot; (reprise) and &quot;From This Day On&quot; (reprise)). Jane leaves, and Tommy tells Jeff that he wants to return to Scotland, although he knows the village will not be there.

The pair return to the spot where they found Brigadoon and, as they expected, see nothing there. Just as they turn to leave, they hear the music again (&quot;Brigadoon&quot;), and Mr. Lundie appears and says, &quot;My my! You must really love her. You woke me up!&quot; Tommy waves goodbye to Jeff and disappears with Mr. Lundie into the Highland mist to be reunited with Fiona.

==Productions==
The show opened in Philadelphia pre-Broadway (tryout) at the Forrest Theatre on February 24, 1947, for two weeks. The original Broadway production, directed by Robert Lewis and choreographed by Agnes de Mille, opened March 13, 1947, at the Ziegfeld Theatre, where it ran for 581 performances. It starred David Brooks as Tommy, George Keane as Jeff, Marion Bell as Fiona, Lee Sullivan as Charlie, Virginia Bosler as Jeannie, James Mitchell as Harry, and Pamela Britton as Meg. The concertmistress of the orchestra was noted American violinist Joan Field. De Mille won the Tony Award for Best Choreography, and Bell and Mitchell won the Theatre World Award. The show returned to Philadelphia post-Broadway at the Shubert Theatre on Monday, September 6, 1948, for two weeks. The production then enjoyed an extended North American tour.

The musical&#x27;s original West End production opened on April 14, 1949, at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, running for 685 performances. It starred Philip Hanna as Tommy, Patricia Hughes as Fiona, James Jamieson as Harry, and Noele Gordon as Meg. Bruce Trent took the leading role in 1949 at His Majesty&#x27;s Theatre. Two telegrams, one from impresario Emile Littler and another where the signature is difficult to identify, to Bruce Trent are dated 24 February 1949.

David Brooks reprised his role of Tommy in the Summertime Light Opera&#x27;s production in Houston, Texas in 1950, with Gregg Juarez as Jeff and Dorothy MacNeil of the New York City Opera as Fiona. Stage direction was by John Brownlee, principal baritone of the Metropolitan Opera, and the musical director and conductor was Frederick Fennell of the Rochester Eastman Kodak Symphony.

The musical was revived at New York City Center in May 1950. It was revived on Broadway seven years later, directed by George H. Englund and choreographed by De Mille, opening on April 15, 1957, at the Adelphi Theatre, where it ran for 24 performances. The cast included David Atkinson, Helen Gallagher, Patricia Birch, and Marilyn Cooper. Another Broadway revival, directed by John Fearnley and choreographed by De Mille, opened on January 30, 1963, at New York City Center, where it ran for 16 performances. The cast included Peter Palmer, Russell Nype, Sally Ann Howes, and Edward Villella. It was Tony-nominated for Best Actress in a Musical (Howes), Best Direction of a Musical, and Best Conductor and Musical Director.

The next Broadway revival, directed by Vivian Matalon and choreographed by De Mille, opened on October 16, 1980, at the Majestic Theatre, where it ran for 133 performances and eight previews. The cast included Meg Bussert, Martin Vidnovic, and John Curry. Vidnovic received Tony and Drama Desk Award nominations, Bussert earned a Tony nomination and won the Theatre World Award, and the production was Tony-nominated for Best Reproduction.

New York City Opera staged the musical in 1986 and 1991.

The musical was revived in the West End at the Victoria Palace Theatre, opening on October 25, 1988, and closing August 5, 1989, starring Robert Meadmore (Tommy), Jacinta Mulcahy, and Lesley Mackie. The director was Roger Redfarn and de Mille&#x27;s dances were rechoreographed by Tommy Shaw. &quot;The Times&quot; reviewer noted that those dances were &quot;the main source of the magic&quot;.

In 2014, a major revival was staged at the Goodman Theater in Chicago. Directed and choreographed by Rachel Rockwell, with a revised book by Brian Hill, Charles Isherwood of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the production &quot;a first-class revival that boasts an infectious buoyancy of spirit and a welcome absence of postmodern flourishes&quot;. This version with the revised book by Hill was staged at the Shaw Festival in 2019.

The 2017 Melbourne production by The Production Company at the State Theatre, with Rohan Browne, Genevive Kingsford and Nancye Hayes and directed by Jason Langley, updated the setting of the world outside Brigadoon to contemporary times.

A staged concert was presented at New York City Center from November 15 to 19, 2017, with Stephanie J. Block as Meg Brockie, Aasif Mandvi as Jeff Douglas, Kelli O&#x27;Hara as Fiona and Patrick Wilson as Tommy Albright. It was directed and choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon. Reviews for this production were uniformly positive.

==Characters and original cast==
==Adaptations==

===Film===
A Cinemascope film version of &quot;Brigadoon&quot;, directed by Vincente Minnelli, was released by MGM in 1954 with Gene Kelly, Van Johnson, and Cyd Charisse in leading roles.

===Television===
On October 15, 1966, a television film version was broadcast on ABC. This version won five Primetime Emmy Awards.

The 1966 television version used a modernized, abbreviated script that accommodated much more of the score than the 1954 film version had, though the entire production ran only ninety minutes with commercials. &quot;My Mother&#x27;s Wedding Day&quot; was restored to this version, though &quot;Once in the Highlands&quot;, &quot;Jeannie&#x27;s Packin&#x27; Up&quot;, and &quot;The Love of My Life&quot; were still absent. In this version, Tommy and Jeff were participating in an auto race when their car stalled just outside Brigadoon.

The TV film starred Robert Goulet as Tommy, Peter Falk as Jeff, and Sally Ann Howes as Fiona. Also appearing were Finlay Currie, in one of his last roles, as Mr. Lundie, Edward Villella as Harry Beaton, and Marlyn Mason as Meg. The TV film was directed by Fielder Cook.

The 1966 telecast of &quot;Brigadoon&quot; has not been shown since its 1968 rebroadcast, nor has it ever been released on videocassette or DVD. It may, however, be viewed on the Internet Archive and on YouTube. In addition, the soundtrack of this TV adaptation was released by Columbia Records (under its &quot;Columbia Special Products&quot; banner) on the same year as the original broadcast.

=== &quot;Schmigadoon!&quot; ===

&quot;Schmigadoon!&quot; is a musical comedy television series which premiered on Apple TV+ on July 16, 2021. The series title indicates an ironic take on &quot;Brigadoon&quot;, while the premise offers an update of the classic plot.

==Reception==
&quot;Brigadoon&quot; opened to very positive reviews with praise for its originality, and for integration of song and story, though some critics had minor points of criticism.

Brooks Atkinson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the musical&#x27;s integration, saying: &quot;For once, the modest label &#x27;musical play&#x27; has a precise meaning. For it is impossible to say where the music and dancing leave off and the story begins. Under Bob Lewis&#x27;s direction all the arts of the theatre have been woven into a singing pattern of enchantment&quot;. Atkinson also emphasized Agnes de Mille&#x27;s contributions as choreographer: &quot;Some of the dances are merely illustrations for the music. One or two of them are conventional, if lovely, maiden round dances. But some of them, like the desperate chase in the forest, are fiercely dramatic. The funeral dance to the dour tune of bagpipes brings the footstep of doom into the forest. And the sword dance, done magnificently by James Mitchell, is tremendously exciting with its stylization of primitive ideas&quot;.

Robert Coleman of the &quot;New York Daily Mirror&quot; said: &quot;It took courage to produce &quot;Brigadoon&quot;, an unconventional musical show of marked originality... [that] still manages to pack a tartan full of popular appeal&quot;. In the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, Howard Barnes pronounced &quot;Brigadoon&quot;: &quot;A bonny thing for Broadway, a scintillating song and dance fantasy that has given theatregoers reason to toss tamoshanters in air&quot;. Robert Garland of the &quot;New York Journal American&quot; particularly praised Pamela Britton as Meg Brockie: &quot;Pamela Britton escaped from both M.G.M. and Frank Sinatra in time to be tough as a Scottish temptress, and rough as a singer of raffish songs&quot;. He also opined that Russian choreographer George Balanchine should watch &quot;Brigadoon&quot; to learn how a musical should be choreographed. Ward Morehouse of &quot;The New York Sun&quot; deemed it &quot;A stunning show&quot;, saying: &quot;It has whimsy, beguiling music, exciting dancing – and it has a book... &quot;Brigadoon&quot; is by far the best musical play the season has produced, and it is certainly one of the best within my entire play-going experience&quot;.

John Chapman of the &quot;Daily News&quot; enjoyed the dances but thought there were too many and that they interrupted the story: &quot;Just when I get pleasantly steamed up about the love of Mr. Brooks and Miss Bell, I don&#x27;t want to be cooled off by watching a herd of gazelles from Chorus Equity running around&quot;. He particularly praised William Hansen&#x27;s performance as Mr. Lundie, declaring that he &quot;is so irresistibly able to persuade you that if there isn&#x27;t a village named &quot;Brigadoon&quot;, there ought to be&quot;.

Louis Kronenberger of &quot;PM&quot; said: &quot;the musical fantasy [&quot;Brigadoon&quot;] not only has charm; it shows a good deal of independence... its charm must lie less in any story it tells than in the general mood it creates; and it has created that mood by fusing a number of theatre elements as densely as possible&quot;. Kronenberger, however, disliked the ending, calling it &quot;an outright blunder&quot; done &quot;in the corniest Broadway fashion&quot;.

Richard Watts Jr. of the &quot;New York Post&quot; wrote: &quot;I have seen other musical comedies that I enjoyed more, but few for which I have a deeper admiration&quot;. He opined that Lerner and Loewe&#x27;s score for &quot;The Day Before Spring&quot; the previous year was better than theirs for &quot;Brigadoon&quot;, explaining that: &quot;If my first emotion last night was admiration rather than sheer enjoyment, it was because the proceedings seemed to me more marked by taste and style than by emotional warmth in book and music, but there is no denying that the authors have matured as theatrical craftsmen&quot;.

&quot;Brigadoon&quot; was awarded the New York Drama Critics&#x27; Circle Award for Best Musical for the 1946-1947 season.

* The &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Meridian&quot; is about a planet that periodically disappears, and is based on Brigadoon. &quot;The Orville&quot; episode &quot;Mad Idolatry&quot; and the &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; episode &quot;The Stars at Night&quot; also feature planets that periodically disappear. In &quot;The Stars at Night&quot;, a character refers to the planet as &quot;one of those Brigadoon-type planets&quot;.
*In Four Weddings and a Funeral, Gareth (Simon Callow) sees a Highland-themed dance party break out and exclaims in delight &quot;It&#x27;s bloody Brigadoon&quot; as he grabs his partner and joins in the revelry.
*In the novel Witches of East End, the eponymous town is referred to as Brigadoon, as it is hidden by a power spell that makes it hard to find.
*In the &quot;Drew&#x27;s Inheritance&quot; episode of The Drew Carey Show, Drew&#x27;s father, giving his son advice before a wedding, tells him not to bother looking for his future wife&#x27;s G-spot because &quot;it&#x27;s like Brigadoon, you know.&quot; Drew quickly corrects him.

<text>Peter Lorre (; born László Löwenstein, ; June 26, 1904 – March 23, 1964) was a Hungarian and American actor, active first in Europe and later in the United States. Known for his timidly devious characters, his appearance, and accented voice, he was frequently typecast as a sinister foreigner. He has been caricatured throughout his life and his cultural legacy remains in media today.

He began his stage career in Vienna, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, before moving to Germany, where he worked first on the stage, then in film, in Berlin during the late 1920s and early 1930s. Lorre, who was Jewish, left Germany after Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party came to power. Lorre caused an international sensation in the Weimar Republic–era film &quot;M&quot; (1931) where he portrayed a serial killer who preys on little girls. His second English-language film was Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot; (1934), made in the United Kingdom. 

Eventually settling in Hollywood, he later became a featured player in many Warner Bros. crime and mystery films. He acted in &quot;Mad Love&quot; (1935), &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; (1935), &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941), &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942), &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; (1944), &quot;Passage to Marseille&quot; (1944), and &quot;My Favorite Brunette&quot; (1947). During this time he acted in several films acting alongside actors Humphrey Bogart and Sydney Greenstreet.

Lorre played Mr. Moto, the Japanese detective, in a series of B-pictures from 1937 to 1939, and was the first actor to play a James Bond villain as Le Chiffre in a TV version of &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1954). He later starred in films such as &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; (1954), &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (1956), &quot;Silk Stockings&quot; (1957), and &quot;The Comedy of Terrors&quot; (1963). Some of his last roles were in horror films directed by Roger Corman. In 2017, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; named him one of the best actors never to have received an Academy Award nomination.

== Early life ==
Lorre was born László Löwenstein () on June 26, 1904, the first child of Alajos Löwenstein and his wife Elvira Freischberger, in the town of Rózsahegy in Liptó County, Kingdom of Hungary (German: &quot;Rosenberg&quot;; Slovak: &quot;Ružomberok&quot;, now in Slovakia). His parents, German-speaking Jews, had recently moved there following his father&#x27;s appointment as chief bookkeeper at a local textile mill. Alajos also served as a lieutenant in the Austrian Army Reserve, and was often away on military maneuvers.

László&#x27;s mother died when he was four years old, leaving Alajos with three very young sons. He soon married his wife&#x27;s best friend Melanie Klein, with whom he had two more children. However, Lorre and his stepmother never got along, and this colored his childhood memories. Anticipating that he might be conscripted following the outbreak of the Second Balkan War, Alajos moved the family to Vienna. He served on the Eastern Front during the winter of 1914–15, before being put in charge of a prison camp due to heart trouble.

== Acting career ==

=== In Europe (1922–1934) ===

Lorre began acting on stage in Vienna aged 17, where he worked with Viennese Art Nouveau artist and puppeteer Richard Teschner. He then moved to Breslau and later to Zürich. In the late 1920s, the actor moved to Berlin, where he worked with Bertolt Brecht, including a role in Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Man Equals Man&quot; and as Dr. Nakamura in the musical &quot;Happy End&quot;.

The actor became much better known after director Fritz Lang cast him as child-killer Hans Beckert in &quot;M&quot; (1931), a film reputedly inspired by the Peter Kürten case. Lang said that he had Lorre in mind for the part and did not give him a screen test because he was already convinced Lorre was perfect for the part. He also stated that the actor gave his best performance in &quot;M&quot; and that it was among the most distinguished in film history. Sharon Packer observed that Lorre played the &quot;loner, [and] schizotypal murderer&quot; with &quot;raspy voice, bulging eyes, and emotive acting (a holdover from the silent screen) [which] always make him memorable.&quot; 

In 1932, Lorre appeared alongside Hans Albers in the science fiction film &quot;F.P.1 antwortet nicht&quot; about an artificial island in the mid-Atlantic.

When the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933, Lorre took refuge first in Paris and then London, where he was noticed by Ivor Montagu, associate producer for &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot; (1934), who reminded the film&#x27;s director, Alfred Hitchcock, about Lorre&#x27;s performance in &quot;M&quot;. They considered him to play the assassin, but wanted to use him in a larger role despite his limited command of English, which Lorre overcame by learning much of his part phonetically. In &quot;The Guardian,&quot; September 2014, Michael Newton wrote, &quot;Lorre cannot help but steal each scene; he&#x27;s a physically present actor, often, you feel, surrounded as he is by the pallid English, the only one in the room with a body.&quot; 

Lorre and his first wife, actress Celia Lovsky, boarded the Cunard-White Star Liner RMS Majestic in Southampton on July 18, 1934, to sail for New York a day after shooting had been completed on &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot;, having gained visitor&#x27;s visas to the United States.

After his first two American films, Lorre returned to England to feature in Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Secret Agent&quot; (1936). 

=== First years in Hollywood (1935–1940) ===
Lorre settled in Hollywood and was soon under contract to Columbia Pictures, which had difficulty finding parts suitable for him. After some months of research, Lorre decided on &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; by Dostoevsky as a suitable project with himself in the central role. Columbia&#x27;s head Harry Cohn agreed to make the film adaptation on the condition that he could lend Lorre to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, possibly as a means of recouping the cost of Lorre not appearing in any of his films.

For MGM&#x27;s &quot;Mad Love&quot; (1935), set in Paris and directed by Karl Freund, Lorre&#x27;s head was shaved for the role of Dr. Gogol, a demented surgeon who replaces the wrecked hands of a concert pianist with those of an executed knife murderer. An actress who works at the nearby Grand Guignol theater, who happens to be the pianist&#x27;s wife, is the subject of Gogol&#x27;s unwelcome infatuation. &quot;Lorre triumphs superbly in a characterization that is sheer horror&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; commented. &quot;There is perhaps no one who can be so repulsive and so utterly wicked. No one who can smile so disarmingly and still sneer. His face is his fortune&quot;.

Lorre followed &quot;Mad Love&quot; with the lead role in &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; (also 1935) directed by Josef von Sternberg. &quot;Although Peter Lorre is occasionally able to give the film a frightening pathological significance,&quot; wrote Andre Sennwald in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on the film&#x27;s release, &quot;this is scarcely Dostoievsky&#x27;s drama of a tortured brain drifting into madness with a terrible secret.&quot; Columbia offered him a five-year contract at $1,000 a week (), but he declined.

Returning from England after appearing in a second Hitchcock picture (&quot;Secret Agent&quot;, 1936), he was offered and accepted a 3-year contract with 20th Century Fox. Starring in a series of Mr. Moto movies, Lorre played John P. Marquand&#x27;s character, a Japanese detective and spy. Initially positive about the films, he soon grew frustrated. &quot;The role is childish,&quot; he said, and eventually tended to dismiss the films entirely. He twisted his shoulder during a stunt in &quot;Mr. Moto Takes a Vacation&quot; (1939), the penultimate entry of the series. In 1939, he attended a lunch at the request of some visiting Japanese officials; Lorre wore a badge that read &quot;Boycott Japanese goods.&quot;

Late in 1938, Universal Pictures wanted to borrow Lorre from Fox for the top-billed titular role ultimately performed by Basil Rathbone in &quot;Son of Frankenstein&quot; (1939) starring Boris Karloff as Frankenstein&#x27;s monster and Bela Lugosi as Ygor. Lorre declined the role because he thought his menacing parts were now behind him, although he was ill at this time. He had tested successfully in 1937 for the role of Quasimodo in an aborted MGM version of &quot;The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&quot;, according to a Fox publicist one of two roles Lorre most wanted to play (the other was Napoleon). Frustrated by broken promises from Fox, Lorre managed to end his contract.

After a brief period as a freelance, he signed for two pictures at RKO in May 1940. In the first of these, Lorre appeared as the anonymous lead in the B-picture &quot;Stranger on the Third Floor&quot; (1940), reputedly the first film noir. The second RKO film, also in 1940, was &quot;You&#x27;ll Find Out&quot;, a musical comedy mystery vehicle for bandleader Kay Kyser in which Lorre spoofed his sinister image alongside horror stars Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff.

=== Mainly at Warner Bros. (1941–1946) ===


In 1941, Lorre became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Director John Huston saved him from more B-pictures by casting him in &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;. Although Warner Bros. was lukewarm, Huston was keen for him to play Joel Cairo, observing that Lorre &quot;had that clear combination of braininess and real innocence, and sophistication... He&#x27;s always doing two things at the same time, thinking one thing and saying something else.&quot; Lorre himself reminisced fondly in 1962 about the &quot;stock company&quot; he now found himself working with: Humphrey Bogart, Sydney Greenstreet and Claude Rains. In his view, the four of them had the rare ability to &quot;switch an audience from laughter to seriousness.&quot; 

Lorre was contracted to Warner on a picture-by-picture basis until 1943 when he signed a five-year contract, renewable each year, which lasted until 1946.

The year after &quot;Maltese Falcon&quot;, he portrayed the character Ugarte in &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942). While Ugarte is a small part, it is he who provides Rick with the &quot;Letters of Transit&quot;, a key plot device. Lorre made nine movies with Sydney Greenstreet counting &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; and &quot;Casablanca&quot;, a team which came to be called &quot;Little Pete-Big Syd&quot;, although they did not always have much screen time in joint scenes. Most of these motion pictures were variations on &quot;Casablanca&quot;, including &quot;Background to Danger&quot; (1943, with George Raft); &quot;Passage to Marseille&quot; (1944), reuniting them with Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains; &quot;The Mask of Dimitrios&quot; (1944); &quot;The Conspirators&quot; (1944, with Hedy Lamarr and Paul Henreid); &quot;Hollywood Canteen&quot; (1944); &quot;Three Strangers&quot; (1946), a suspense film about three people who are joint partners on a winning lottery ticket, with third-billed Lorre cast against type by director Jean Negulesco as the romantic lead, also starring Geraldine Fitzgerald; and Greenstreet and Lorre&#x27;s final film together, suspense thriller &quot;The Verdict&quot; (1946), director Don Siegel&#x27;s first feature, with Greenstreet and Lorre finally billed first and second, respectively.

Lorre returned to comedy with the role of Dr. Einstein in Frank Capra&#x27;s version of &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; (released in 1944) starring Cary Grant and Raymond Massey. Writing in 1944, film critic Manny Farber described what he called Lorre&#x27;s &quot;double-take job&quot;, a characteristic dramatic flourish &quot;where the actor&#x27;s face changes rapidly from laughter, love or a security that he doesn&#x27;t really feel to a face more sincerely menacing, fearful or deadpan.&quot;

Lorre&#x27;s last film for Warner was &quot;The Beast with Five Fingers&quot; (1946), a horror film in which he played a crazed astrologer who falls in love with a character played by Andrea King. Daniel Bubbeo, in &quot;The Women of Warner Brothers&quot;, thought Lorre&#x27;s &quot;wildly over-the top performance&quot; had &quot;elevated the movie from minor horror to first-rate camp.&quot;

Lorre said his continuing friendship with Bertolt Brecht, in exile in California since 1941, had led studio head Jack L. Warner to &#x27;graylist&#x27; him, and his contract with Warner Bros. was terminated on May 13, 1946. Warner would be a &quot;friendly&quot; witness at his appearance before the House Un-American Activities Committee in May 1947. Lorre himself was sympathetic to the short-lived Committee for the First Amendment, set up by John Huston and others, and added his name to advertisements in the trade press in support of the committee.

=== After World War II (1947–1964) ===

After World War II and the end of his Warner contract, Lorre&#x27;s acting career in Hollywood experienced a downturn He concentrated on radio and stage work. In 1949, he filed for bankruptcy. In the autumn of 1950, he traveled to West Germany to make the film noir &quot;Der Verlorene&quot; (&quot;The Lost One&quot;, 1951) which Lorre co-wrote, directed and starred in. According to Gerd Gemünden in &quot;Continental Strangers: German Exile Cinema, 1933–1951&quot;, with the exception of Josef von Báky&#x27;s &quot;Der Ruf&quot; (&quot;The Last Illusion&quot;, 1949), it is the only film by an emigrant from Germany which uses a return to the country &quot;addressing questions of guilt and responsibility; of accountability and justice.&quot; While it gained some critical approval, audiences avoided it and it did badly at the box office.

In February 1952, Lorre returned to the United States, where he resumed appearances as a character actor in television and feature films, often parodying his &quot;creepy&quot; image. He was the first actor to play a &quot;James Bond&quot; villain when he portrayed Le Chiffre in a 1954 television adaptation of Ian Fleming&#x27;s novel &quot;Casino Royale&quot;, opposite Barry Nelson as an American James Bond referred to as &quot;Jimmy Bond&quot;. Lorre starred alongside Kirk Douglas and James Mason in &quot;20,000 Leagues Under the Sea&quot; (1954) around this time. Lorre appeared in NBC&#x27;s espionage drama &quot;Five Fingers&quot; (1959), starring David Hedison, in the episode &quot;Thin Ice&quot;, and, in 1960, in &quot;Rawhide&quot; as Victor Laurier in &quot;The Incident of the Slavemaster&quot; and in &quot;Wagon Train&quot; as Alexander Portlass in &quot;The Alexander Portlass Story&quot;. Lorre appeared in six episodes of &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; as well as two episodes of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; broadcast in 1957 and 1960, the latter a version of the Roald Dahl short story &quot;Man from the South&quot; starring Steve McQueen, Lorre and McQueen&#x27;s wife Neile Adams. He had a supporting role in the film &quot;Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea&quot; (1961).

In Lorre&#x27;s last years, he worked with Roger Corman on several low-budget films, including two of the director&#x27;s Edgar Allan Poe cycle: &quot;Tales of Terror&quot; (1962) with Vincent Price and Basil Rathbone; and &quot;The Raven&quot; (1963), again with Price, as well as Boris Karloff and Jack Nicholson. He again worked with Price, Karloff and Rathbone in the Jacques Tourneur-directed &quot;The Comedy of Terrors&quot; (1963). He also appeared in a memorable 1962 episode of &quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;Lizard&#x27;s Leg and Owlet&#x27;s Wing&quot;, with Lon Chaney Jr. and Boris Karloff.

== Marriages and family ==
Lorre was married three times: Celia Lovsky (1934 – March 13, 1945, divorced); Kaaren Verne (May 25, 1945 – 1950, divorced) and Anne Marie Brenning (July 21, 1953 – March 23, 1964, his death). In 1953, Brenning bore Lorre&#x27;s only child, Catharine. Anne Marie Brenning died in 1971. His daughter later made headlines after serial killer Kenneth Bianchi confessed to police investigators that he and his cousin and fellow &quot;Hillside Strangler&quot; Angelo Buono, posing as undercover police officers, had stopped her in 1977 with the intent of abduction and murder, but let her go on learning that she was the daughter of Peter Lorre. It was only after Bianchi was arrested that Catharine realized whom she had met. Catharine died of complications from diabetes, on May 7, 1985, aged 32.

== Failing health and death ==

Lorre had suffered from chronic gallbladder troubles, for which doctors had prescribed morphine. Lorre became trapped between the constant pain and addiction to morphine to ease the problem. It was during the period of the Mr. Moto films that Lorre struggled with and overcame his addiction. Having quickly gained 100 lb (45 kg) and not fully recovering from his addiction to morphine, Lorre suffered personal and career disappointments in his later life.

He died in Los Angeles on March 23, 1964, from a stroke. His body was cremated and his ashes were interred at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood. Vincent Price read the eulogy at his funeral.

== Legacy and honors ==

Lorre was inducted into the Grand Order of Water Rats, the world&#x27;s oldest theatrical fraternity, in 1942. Lorre was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6619 Hollywood Boulevard in February 1960.

Being Warner Bros. cartoonists&#x27; favorite characterization, Lorre was regularly caricatured in numerous &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; animated film shorts, including &quot;Hollywood Steps Out&quot; (1941), &quot;Horton Hatches the Egg&quot; (1942), &quot;Hair-Raising Hare&quot; (1946), and many more through the 1940s and 1950s. Future caricatures of Lorre have persisted in film and television for decades afterwards, including live-action and animated bit characters in numerous films and television programs. Vocal impressions of Lorre have been used to create the voices of cartoon characters such as Morocco Mole on &quot;The Secret Squirrel Show&quot; in the 1960s, Ren Höek in &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; in the 1990s, and Kamek the magician in &quot;The Super Mario Bros. Movie&quot; in 2023.

Actor Eugene Weingand, who was unrelated to Lorre, attempted in 1963 to trade on his slight resemblance to the actor by changing his name to &quot;Peter Lorie&quot;, but his petition was rejected by the courts. After Lorre&#x27;s death, however, he referred to himself as &quot;Peter Lorre Jr.&quot;, claiming to be Lorre&#x27;s son. He obtained a few small acting roles as a result, including a brief uncredited appearance as a cab driver in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Torn Curtain&quot; (1966) starring Paul Newman and Julie Andrews.

Filk songwriter Tom Smith (1988) wrote a tribute to Lorre&#x27;s acting called &quot;I Want to Be Peter Lorre&quot;, which was nominated for the &quot;Best Tribute&quot; Pegasus Award in 1992 and 2004, and which won the award for &quot;Best Classic Filk Song&quot; in 2006.

Punk cabaret band The World/Inferno Friendship Society&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Addicted to Bad Ideas: Peter Lorre&#x27;s Twentieth Century&quot; is a concept album written as a tribute to Lorre, focusing on the transition from Weimar Germany to the Third Reich, and Lorre&#x27;s later career and death. The World/Inferno Friendship Society&#x27;s lead singer Jack Terricloth describes Lorre as &quot;a strangely charismatic, extremely creepy person, which I think most punk rockers can identify with ... It&#x27;s the lure of the other. He&#x27;s the underdog, the outsider.&quot;

In her career spanning over six decades, she has garnered numerous accolades, including an Academy Award, a Tony Award, two Primetime Emmy Awards and an Olivier Award, making her one of the few performers to achieve the Triple Crown of Acting. She has also received various honorary awards, including the BAFTA Fellowship Award, the Golden Lion Honorary Award, and an induction into the American Theatre Hall of Fame.

Redgrave made her acting debut on stage with the production of &quot;&quot; in 1958. She rose to prominence in 1961 playing Rosalind in the Shakespearean comedy &quot;As You Like It&quot; with the Royal Shakespeare Company, and has since starred in numerous productions on the West End and on Broadway. She won the Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Revival for &quot;The Aspern Papers&quot; (1984), and received nominations for &quot;A Touch of the Poet&quot; (1988), &quot;John Gabriel Borkman&quot; (1997), and &quot;The Inheritance&quot; (2019).

Redgrave made her film debut co-starring her father in the 1958 medical drama &quot;Behind the Mask&quot;. She rose to prominence as a film actor with the satire &quot;&quot; (1966), which garnered her first of her six Academy Award nominations, winning Best Supporting Actress for &quot;Julia&quot; (1977). Her other nominations are for &quot;Isadora&quot; (1968), &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots&quot; (1971), &quot;The Bostonians&quot; (1984), and &quot;Howards End&quot; (1992).

A member of the Redgrave family of actors, she is the daughter of Sir Michael Redgrave and Lady Redgrave (Rachel Kempson), the sister of Lynn Redgrave and Corin Redgrave, the wife of Italian actor Franco Nero, the mother of actresses Joely Richardson and Natasha Richardson and screenwriter and director Carlo Gabriel Nero, the aunt of British actress Jemma Redgrave, the mother-in-law of actor Liam Neeson and film producer Tim Bevan, and the grandmother of Daisy Bevan, Micheál Richardson and Daniel Neeson.

== Early life ==

Vanessa Redgrave was born on 30 January 1937 in Blackheath, London, the daughter of actors Sir Michael Redgrave and Rachel Kempson. Laurence Olivier announced her birth to the audience at a performance of &quot;Hamlet&quot; at the Old Vic, when he said that Laertes (played by Sir Michael) had a daughter. Accounts say Olivier announced, &quot;A great actress has been born this night.&quot;

In her autobiography, Redgrave recalls the East End and Coventry Blitzes among her earliest memories. Following the East End Blitz, Redgrave relocated with her family to Bromyard, Herefordshire before returning to London in 1943. She was educated at two independent schools for girls: the Alice Ottley School in Worcester, and Queen&#x27;s Gate School in London, before &quot;coming out&quot; as a debutante. Her siblings Lynn Redgrave and Corin Redgrave were also actors.

== Career ==

=== Early stage and film career ===
Vanessa Redgrave entered the Central School of Speech and Drama in 1954. She first appeared in the West End, playing opposite her brother, in 1958.

In 1959, she appeared at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre under the direction of Peter Hall as Helena in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; opposite Charles Laughton as Bottom and &quot;Coriolanus&quot; opposite Laurence Olivier (in the title role), Albert Finney and Edith Evans.

In 1960, Redgrave had her first starring role in Robert Bolt&#x27;s &quot;The Tiger and the Horse&quot;, in which she co-starred with her father. In 1961, she played Rosalind in &quot;As You Like It&quot; for the Royal Shakespeare Company. In 1962, she played Imogen in William Gaskill&#x27;s production of &quot;Cymbeline&quot; for the RSC. In 1966, Redgrave created the role of Jean Brodie in the Donald Albery production of &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot;, adapted for the stage by Jay Presson Allen from the novel by Muriel Spark.

Redgrave had her first credited film role, in which she co-starred with her father, in Brian Desmond Hurst&#x27;s &quot;Behind the Mask&quot; (1958). Redgrave&#x27;s first starring film role was in &quot;Morgan – A Suitable Case for Treatment&quot; (1966), co-starring David Warner and directed by Karel Reisz, for which she received an Oscar nomination, a Cannes award, a Golden Globe nomination and a BAFTA Film Award nomination. Following this, she portrayed a mysterious woman in &quot;Blowup&quot; (1966). Co-starring David Hemmings, it was the first English-language film of the Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni. Reunited with Karel Reisz for the biographical film of dancer Isadora Duncan in &quot;Isadora&quot; (1968), her portrayal of Duncan led her gaining a National Society of Film Critics&#x27; Award for Best Actress, a second Prize for the Best Female Performance at the Cannes Film Festival, along with a Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination. In 1970 and 1971, Vanessa was directed by Italian filmmaker Tinto Brass in two films: &quot;Dropout&quot; and &quot;La vacanza&quot;.
In the same period came other portrayals of historical (or semi-mythical) figures – ranging from Andromache in &quot;The Trojan Women&quot; (1971) to the lead in &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots&quot; (1971), the latter earning her a third Oscar nomination. She also played the role of Guinevere in the film &quot;Camelot&quot; (1967) with Richard Harris and Franco Nero, and briefly as Sylvia Pankhurst in &quot;Oh! What a Lovely War&quot; (1969). She portrayed the character of Mother Superior Jeanne des Anges (Joan of the Angels) in &quot;The Devils&quot; (1971), the once controversial film directed by Ken Russell.

=== &quot;Julia&quot; (1977) ===
In the film &quot;Julia&quot; (1977), she starred in the title role as a woman murdered by the Nazi German regime in the years prior to World War II for her anti-Fascist activism. Her co-star in the film was Jane Fonda (playing writer Lillian Hellman). In her 2005 autobiography, Fonda wrote that:
When Redgrave was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress in 1977 for her role in &quot;Julia&quot;, members of the Jewish Defense League (JDL), led by Rabbi Meir Kahane, burned effigies of Redgrave and picketed the Academy Awards ceremony to protest against what they saw as her support for the Palestine Liberation Organization.

This film opened in 1977, the same year she produced and appeared in the film &quot;The Palestinian&quot;, which followed the activities of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in Lebanon. The film was criticised by many Jewish groups for its perceived anti-Israel slant, and members of the Jewish Defense League (JDL) picketed Redgrave&#x27;s nomination outside the Academy Awards ceremony while counter-protestors waved PLO flags. Redgrave won the Oscar and in her acceptance speech, she thanked Hollywood for having &quot;refused to be intimidated by the threats of a small bunch of Zionist hoodlums – whose behaviour is an insult to the stature of Jews all over the world and to their great and heroic record of struggle against fascism and oppression&quot;. Her remarks brought an on-stage response later in the ceremony from Academy Award–winning screenwriter and award presenter at that year&#x27;s ceremony Paddy Chayefsky and sparked controversy. In his biography of Redgrave, Dan Callahan wrote, &quot;The scandal of her awards speech and the negative press it occasioned had a destructive effect on her acting opportunities that would last for years to come&quot;.

=== Later career ===

==== Film and television ====
Later film roles include those of Agatha Christie in &quot;Agatha&quot; (1979), Helen in &quot;Yanks&quot; (1979), a Holocaust survivor in &quot;Playing for Time&quot; (1980), Leenie Cabrezi in &quot;My Body, My Child&quot; (1982), The Queen in &quot;Sing, Sing&quot; (1983), suffragist Olive Chancellor in &quot;The Bostonians&quot; (1984, a fourth Best Actress Academy Award nomination), transsexual tennis player Renée Richards in &quot;Second Serve&quot; (1986), Blanche Hudson in the television remake of &quot;What Ever Happened to Baby Jane&quot; (1991), Mrs. Wilcox in &quot;Howards End&quot; (1992, her sixth Academy Award nomination, this time in a supporting role); arms dealer Max in &quot;&quot; (1996, when discussing the role of Max, Brian DePalma and Tom Cruise thought it would be fun to cast an actor like Redgrave; they then decided to go with the real thing); Oscar Wilde&#x27;s mother in &quot;Wilde&quot; (1997); Clarissa Dalloway in &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; (1997); and Dr. Sonia Wick in &quot;Girl, Interrupted&quot; (1999). Many of these roles and others garnered her widespread accolades.

Her performance as a lesbian mourning the loss of her longtime partner in the HBO series &quot;If These Walls Could Talk 2&quot; (2000) earned her a Golden Globe for Best TV Series Supporting Actress, as well as earning an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a TV Film or Miniseries. This same performance also led to an Excellence in Media Award from the Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD). In 2004, Redgrave joined the second-season cast of the FX series &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;, portraying Dr. Erica Noughton, the mother of Julia McNamara, who was played by her real-life daughter Joely Richardson. She also made appearances in the third and sixth seasons. In 2006, Redgrave starred opposite Peter O&#x27;Toole in the film &quot;Venus&quot;. A year later, Redgrave starred in &quot;Evening&quot; and &quot;Atonement&quot;, in which she received a Broadcast Film Critics Association award nomination for a performance that took up only seven minutes of screen time.

In 2008, Redgrave appeared as a narrator in an Arts Alliance production, id – Identity of the Soul. In 2009, Redgrave starred in the BBC remake of &quot;The Day of the Triffids&quot;, with her daughter Joely. In the midst of losing her daughter, Natasha Richardson, Redgrave signed on to play Eleanor of Aquitaine in Ridley Scott&#x27;s version of &quot;Robin Hood&quot; (2010), which began filming shortly after Natasha&#x27;s death. Redgrave later withdrew from the film for personal reasons. The part was given to her &quot;Evening&quot; co-star Eileen Atkins. She was next seen in &quot;Letters to Juliet&quot; opposite her husband Franco Nero.

She had small roles in &quot;Eva&quot; (2009), a Romanian drama film that premiered at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, as well as in Julian Schnabel&#x27;s Palestinian drama &quot;Miral&quot; (2010), which was screened at the 67th Venice International Film Festival. She voiced the character of Winnie the Giant Tortoise in the environmental animated film &quot;Animals United&quot; (also 2010), and played a supporting role in the Bosnia-set political drama, &quot;The Whistleblower&quot; (2010), which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival. Redgrave also narrated Patrick Keiller&#x27;s semi-fictional documentary, &quot;Robinson in Ruins&quot; (2010). Since 2012, Redgrave has narrated the BBC series &quot;Call The Midwife&quot;.

She also played leading roles in two historical films: Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Coriolanus&quot; (which marked actor Ralph Fiennes&#x27; directorial debut), in which she plays Volumnia; and Roland Emmerich&#x27;s &quot;Anonymous&quot; (both 2011), as .

Subsequently, she starred with Terence Stamp and Gemma Arterton in the British comedy-drama &quot;Song for Marion&quot; (US: &quot;Unfinished Song&quot;, 2012) and with Forest Whitaker in &quot;The Butler&quot; (2013), directed by Lee Daniels. She also appeared with Steve Carell and Channing Tatum in the drama &quot;Foxcatcher&quot; (2014).

In 2017, at the age of 80, Redgrave made her directorial debut with the feature documentary &quot;Sea Sorrow&quot;, which covers the plight of child migrants in the Calais refugee camps and the broader European migrant crisis. It premiered at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival. Critics praised the documentary&#x27;s message but criticised the structure for a &quot;scattershot lack of focus&quot; and the &quot;ungainliness of its production values.&quot;

In June 2024, principal photography was completed on &quot;The Estate,&quot; a feature drama, executive produced by Redgrave, her husband Franco Nero, and son Carlo Gabriel Nero. The film is written and directed by her son, and stars Redgrave and Franco Nero.

==== Theatre ====
Redgrave won four Evening Standard Awards for Best Actress in four decades. She was awarded the Laurence Olivier Award for Actress of the Year in a Revival in 1984 for &quot;The Aspern Papers&quot;.

In 2000, her theatre work included Prospero in &quot;The Tempest&quot; at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe in London. In 2003, she won a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play for her performance in the Broadway revival of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Long Day&#x27;s Journey Into Night&quot;. In January 2006, Redgrave was presented the Ibsen Centennial Award for her &quot;outstanding work in interpreting many of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s works over the last decades&quot;. Previous recipients of the award include Liv Ullmann, Glenda Jackson and Claire Bloom.

In 2007, Redgrave played Joan Didion in her Broadway stage adaptation of her 2005 book, &quot;The Year of Magical Thinking&quot;, which played 144 regular performances in a 24-week limited engagement at the Booth Theatre. For this, she won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One-Person Show and was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play. She reprised the role at the Lyttelton Theatre at the Royal National Theatre in London to mixed reviews. She also spent a week performing the work at the Theatre Royal in Bath in September 2008. She once again performed the role of Joan Didion for a special benefit at Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York on 26 October 2009. The performance was originally slated to debut on 27 April, but was pushed due to the death of Redgrave&#x27;s daughter Natasha. The proceeds for the benefit were donated to the United Nations Children&#x27;s Fund (UNICEF) and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). Both charities work to provide help for the children of Gaza.

In October 2010, she starred in the Broadway premiere of &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; starring in the title role opposite James Earl Jones. The show premiered on 25 October 2010 at the John Golden Theatre in New York City to rave reviews. The production was originally scheduled to run to 29 January 2011 but due to a successful response and high box office sales, was extended to 9 April 2011. In May 2011, she was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Play for the role of Daisy in &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot;. The play transferred to the Wyndham&#x27;s Theatre in London from 26 September to 17 December 2011.

In 2013, Redgrave starred alongside Jesse Eisenberg in Eisenberg&#x27;s &quot;The Revisionist&quot;. The New York production ran from 15 February to 27 April. Redgrave played a Polish holocaust survivor in the play. In September 2013, Redgrave once again starred opposite James Earl Jones in a production of &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; at The Old Vic, London, directed by Mark Rylance.

In 2016, Redgrave played Queen Margaret in &quot;Richard III&quot; with Ralph Fiennes in the title role, at the Almeida Theatre, London.

In February 2022, it was confirmed that she would be playing Mrs Higgins in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; at the London Coliseum from May to August 2022.

In a poll of &quot;industry experts&quot; and readers conducted by &quot;The Stage&quot; in 2010, Redgrave was ranked as the ninth greatest stage actor/actress of all time.

== Personal life ==
Redgrave was married to film and theatre director Tony Richardson from 1962 to 1967; the couple had two daughters: actresses Natasha Richardson (1963–2009), and Joely Richardson (b. 1965). In 1967, the year Redgrave divorced Richardson, who left her for the French actress Jeanne Moreau, she became romantically involved with Italian actor Franco Nero when they met on the set of &quot;Camelot&quot;. In 1969, they had a son, Carlo Gabriel Redgrave Sparanero (known professionally as Carlo Gabriel Nero), a screenwriter and director. From 1971 to 1986, she had a long-term relationship with actor Timothy Dalton, with whom she had appeared in the film &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots&quot; (1971). Redgrave later reunited with Franco Nero, and they married on 31 December 2006. Carlo Nero directed Redgrave in &quot;The Fever&quot; (2004), a film adaptation of the Wallace Shawn play. Redgrave has six grandchildren.

Within 14 months in 2009 and 2010, Redgrave lost both a daughter and her two younger siblings. Her daughter Natasha Richardson died on 18 March 2009 from a traumatic brain injury caused by a skiing accident. On 6 April 2010, her brother, Corin Redgrave, died, and on 2 May 2010, her sister, Lynn Redgrave, died.

Redgrave had a near-fatal heart attack in April 2015. In September 2015, she revealed that her lungs are only working at 30 per cent capacity due to emphysema caused by years of smoking.

Redgrave has described herself as a person of faith and said that she &quot;sometimes&quot; attends a Catholic church.

== Political activism ==
In 1961, Vanessa Redgrave was an active member of the Committee of 100 and its working group. Redgrave and her brother Corin joined the Workers Revolutionary Party (WRP) in the 1970s. She ran for parliament several times as a party member but never received more than a few hundred votes. The party disbanded in 1985 amid allegations that chairman Gerry Healy was implicated in sexual abuse of female supporters.

On 17 March 1968, Redgrave participated in the anti-Vietnam War protest outside United States Embassy in Grosvenor Square. She was allowed to enter the embassy to deliver a protest.

Redgrave used her wage from &quot;Mary, Queen of Scots&quot; to build a nursery school, near her home in west London. She donated the school to the state.

After the 1973 Old Bailey bombing, Redgrave volunteered to post bond for the defendants and offered up her own house in West Hampstead, should any of them need a place to stay. None of the defendants were released from custody to take her up on her offer.

In 1977, Redgrave produced and starred in a controversial documentary film, &quot;The Palestinian&quot;, about the activities of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). She funded the documentary by selling her house. The Anti-Defamation League&#x27;s honorary chairman criticised the film, highlighting that some of the responses of the people she interviews were not translated from Arabic, that the film showed children training with guns and that the phrase, &quot;Kill the enemy!&quot; kept being repeated. The president of Actors Equity in the United States criticised the film&#x27;s interview with the chairman of the PLO, Yasser Arafat, in which he said that the only solution to the Middle East problem is the liquidation of the State of Israel, and Redgrave responded with, &quot;Certainly&quot;. In June 1978, at one theatre showing the film, a bomb exploded, causing damage to property, but screening of the film resumed the following day. Two months later, a Jewish Defence League member was convicted of the bombing and sentenced to a three-month &quot;thorough psychological examination&quot; with the California Youth Authority. In a 2018 interview, Redgrave stood by her acceptance speech (which included the &quot;Zionist hoodlums&quot; remark) during the 1978 Academy Awards ceremony.

In 1977, Redgrave offered a resolution asking the British actors union to boycott Israel, allegedly including the selling of any taped material. The resolution was reportedly not brought to a vote.

In 1980, Redgrave made her American TV debut as concentration camp survivor Fania Fénelon in the Arthur Miller-scripted TV movie &quot;Playing for Time&quot;, a part for which she won an Emmy as Outstanding Lead Actress in 1981. The decision to cast Redgrave as Fénelon was, however, a source of controversy. In light of Redgrave&#x27;s support for the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), Fénelon herself and the Jewish groups the Simon Wiesenthal Center, the Anti-Defamation League, and the American Jewish Congress objected to Redgrave&#x27;s casting. Rabbi Marvin Hier of the Simon Wiesenthal Center wrote in a telegram that, &quot;Your selection shows utter callous disregard of the tens of thousands of survivors for whom Miss Redgrave&#x27;s portrayal would desecrate the memory of the martyred millions. Your decision could only be compared to selecting J. Edgar Hoover to portray Martin Luther King Jr.&quot; Producer David L. Wolper in a telephone interview compared it to letting the head of the Ku Klux Klan play a sympathetic white man in &quot;Roots&quot;, a miniseries about the slave trade. Arthur Miller said &quot;She&#x27;s a Marxist; this is a political matter. Turning her down because of her ideas was unacceptable to me; after all I suffered the blacklist myself&quot;.

In 1984, Redgrave sued the Boston Symphony Orchestra, claiming that the orchestra had fired her from a 1982 performance because of her support of the PLO. Lillian Hellman testified in court on Redgrave&#x27;s behalf. Redgrave won on a count of breach of contract, but did not win on the claim that the Boston orchestra had violated her civil rights by firing her.

In 1995, Redgrave was elected to serve as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador. In December 2002, Redgrave paid £50,000 bail for Chechen separatist Deputy Premier and special envoy Akhmed Zakayev, who had sought political asylum in the United Kingdom and was accused by the Russian government of aiding and abetting hostage-takings in the Moscow Hostage Crisis of 2002 and guerrilla warfare against Russia. 

At a press conference, Redgrave said she feared for Zakayev&#x27;s safety if he were extradited to Russia on terrorism charges. He would &quot;die of a heart attack&quot; or some other mysterious explanation offered by Russia, she said. On 13 November 2003, a London court rejected the Russian government&#x27;s request for Zakayev&#x27;s extradition. Instead, the court accepted a plea by lawyers for Zakayev that he would not get a fair trial, and could even face torture, in Russia. &quot;It would be unjust and oppressive to return Mr Zakayev to Russia,&quot; Judge Timothy Workman ruled. Due to her support of Zakayev and Chechen independence, she was awarded the Order of Friendship by the Chechen government in exile in 2024.

In 2004, Vanessa Redgrave and her brother Corin Redgrave launched the Peace and Progress Party, which campaigned against the Iraq War and for human rights. Redgrave left the party in 2005.

Redgrave has been an outspoken critic of the &quot;war on terrorism&quot;. During a June 2005 interview on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, Redgrave was challenged on this criticism and on her political views. In response she questioned whether there can be true democracy if the political leadership of the United States and Britain does not &quot;uphold the values for which my father&#x27;s generation fought the Nazis, [and] millions of people gave their lives against the Soviet Union&#x27;s regime. [Such sacrifice was made] because of democracy and what democracy meant: no torture, no camps, no detention forever or without trial... [Such] techniques are not just alleged [against the governments of the U.S. and Britain], they have actually been written about by the FBI. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s being &#x27;far left&#x27;...to uphold the rule of law.&quot;

In March 2006, Redgrave remarked in an interview with US broadcast journalist Amy Goodman: &quot;I don&#x27;t know of a single government that actually abides by international human rights law, not one, including my own. In fact, [they] violate these laws in the most despicable and obscene way, I would say.&quot; Goodman&#x27;s interview with Redgrave took place in the actress&#x27;s West London home on the evening of 7 March, and covered a range of subjects, particularly the cancellation by the New York Theatre Workshop of the Alan Rickman production &quot;My Name is Rachel Corrie&quot;. Such a development, said Redgrave, was an &quot;act of catastrophic cowardice&quot; as &quot;the essence of life and the essence of theatre is to communicate about lives, either lives that have ended or lives that are still alive, [and about] beliefs, and what is in those beliefs.&quot;

In June 2006, she was awarded a lifetime achievement award from the Transilvania International Film Festival, one of whose sponsors is a mining company named Gabriel Resources. She dedicated the award to a community organisation from Roşia Montană, Romania, which is campaigning against a gold mine that Gabriel Resources was seeking to build near the village. Gabriel Resources placed an &quot;open letter&quot; in &quot;The Guardian&quot; on 23 June 2006, attacking Redgrave, arguing the case for the mine. The open letter was signed by 77 villagers.

In December 2007, Redgrave was named as one of the possible suretors who paid the £50,000 bail for Jamil al-Banna, one of three British residents arrested after landing back in the UK following four years&#x27; captivity at Guantanamo Bay. Redgrave has declined to be specific about her financial involvement but said she was &quot;very happy&quot; to be of &quot;some small assistance for Jamil and his wife&quot;, adding, &quot;It is a profound honour and I am glad to be alive to be able to do this. Guantanamo Bay is a concentration camp.&quot;

In 2009, Redgrave together with artist Julian Schnabel and playwright Martin Sherman opposed the cultural boycott of Israel in the Toronto Film Festival.

In March 2014, Redgrave took part in a protest outside Pentonville Prison in North London after new prison regulations were introduced which forbade sending books to prisoners. She and fellow actor Samuel West, playwright David Hare and Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy took turns reading poetry and making speeches. Redgrave stated that the ban was &quot;vicious and deplorable...Literature is something that stirs us beyond our immediate problems, it can help us to learn better our own problems, our own faults or to have a goal to live for, an aspiration.&quot; The ban was overturned by the Ministry of Justice the following December.

In 2017, Redgrave made her directorial debut with the movie &quot;Sea Sorrow&quot;, a documentary about the European migrant crisis and the plight of migrants encamped outside Calais, France, trying to reach Britain. She has heavily criticised the exclusionary policy of the British government towards refugees, stating that the British Government &quot;... has violated these principles (of the Declaration of Human Rights), and it continues to do so, which I find deeply shameful. The UN signed the Declaration of Human Rights, and now we have to employ lawyers to take the government to court to force them to obey the law. Just thinking about that makes my mind go berserk.&quot;

<text>Johann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller ( ; 10 November 17599 May 1805) was a German playwright, poet, philosopher and historian. Schiller is considered by most Germans to be Germany&#x27;s most important classical playwright.

He was born in Marbach to a devoutly Protestant family. Initially intended for the priesthood, in 1773 he entered a military academy in Stuttgart and ended up studying medicine. His first play, &quot;The Robbers&quot;, was written at this time and proved very successful. After a brief stint as a regimental doctor, he left Stuttgart and eventually wound up in Weimar. In 1789, he became professor of History and Philosophy at Jena, where he wrote historical works.

During the last seventeen years of his life (1788–1805), Schiller developed a productive, if complicated, friendship with the already famous and influential Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. They frequently discussed issues concerning aesthetics, and Schiller encouraged Goethe to finish works that he had left as sketches. This relationship and these discussions led to a period now referred to as Weimar Classicism. Together they founded the Weimar Theater.

They also worked together on &quot;Xenien&quot;, a collection of short satirical poems in which both Schiller and Goethe challenge opponents of their philosophical vision.

==Early life and career==
Friedrich Schiller was born on 10 November 1759, in Marbach, Württemberg, as the only son of military doctor Johann Kaspar Schiller (1723–1796) and Elisabetha Dorothea Schiller (1732–1802). They also had five daughters, including Christophine, the eldest. Schiller grew up in a very religious Protestant family and spent much of his youth studying the Bible, which would later influence his writing for the theatre. His father was away in the Seven Years&#x27; War when Friedrich was born. He was named after king Frederick the Great, but he was called Fritz by nearly everyone. Kaspar Schiller was rarely home during the war, but he did manage to visit the family once in a while. His wife and children also visited him occasionally wherever he happened to be stationed. When the war ended in 1763, Schiller&#x27;s father became a recruiting officer and was stationed in Schwäbisch Gmünd. The family moved with him. Due to the high cost of living—especially the rent—the family moved to the nearby town of Lorch.

Although the family was happy in Lorch, Schiller&#x27;s father found his work unsatisfying. He sometimes took his son with him. In Lorch, Schiller received his primary education. The quality of the lessons was fairly bad, and Friedrich regularly cut class with his older sister. Because his parents wanted Schiller to become a priest, they had the priest of the village instruct the boy in Latin and Greek. Father Moser was a good teacher, and later Schiller named the cleric in his first play &quot;Die Räuber&quot; (&quot;The Robbers&quot;) after him. As a boy, Schiller was excited by the idea of becoming a cleric and often put on black robes and pretended to preach.

In 1766, the family left Lorch for the Duke of Württemberg&#x27;s principal residence, Ludwigsburg. Schiller&#x27;s father had not been paid for three years, and the family had been living on their savings but could no longer afford to do so. So Kaspar Schiller took an assignment to the garrison in Ludwigsburg.

There the boy Schiller came to the attention of Karl Eugen, Duke of Württemberg. He entered the Karlsschule Stuttgart (an elite military academy founded by the Duke), in 1773, where he eventually studied medicine. During most of his short life, he suffered from illnesses that he tried to cure himself.

While at the Karlsschule, Schiller read Rousseau and Goethe and discussed Classical ideals with his classmates. At school, he wrote his first play, &quot;The Robbers&quot;, which dramatizes the conflict between two aristocratic brothers: the elder, Karl Moor, leads a group of rebellious students into the Bohemian forest where they become Robin Hood-like bandits, while Franz Moor, the younger brother, schemes to inherit his father&#x27;s considerable estate. The play&#x27;s critique of social corruption and its affirmation of proto-revolutionary republican ideals astounded its original audience. Schiller became an overnight sensation. Later, Schiller would be made an honorary member of the French Republic because of this play. The play was inspired by Leisewitz&#x27; earlier play &quot;Julius of Taranto&quot;, a favourite of the young Schiller.

In 1780, he obtained a post as regimental doctor in Stuttgart, a job he disliked. In order to attend the first performance of &quot;The Robbers&quot; in Mannheim, Schiller left his regiment without permission. As a result, he was arrested, sentenced to 14 days of imprisonment, and forbidden by Karl Eugen from publishing any further works.

He fled Stuttgart in 1782, going via Frankfurt, Mannheim, Leipzig, and Dresden to Weimar. During the journey, he had an affair with Charlotte von Kalb, an army officer&#x27;s wife. At the centre of an intellectual circle, she was known for her cleverness and instability. To extricate himself from a dire financial situation and attachment to a married woman, Schiller eventually sought help from family and friends. In 1787, he settled in Weimar and in 1789, was appointed professor of History and Philosophy in Jena, where he wrote only historical works.

==Marriage and family==

On 22 February 1790, Schiller married Charlotte von Lengefeld (1766–1826), sister of writer Caroline von Wolzogen (1763–1847) and daughter of forest administrator of Louis Günther II, Prince of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt (1715–1775) and his wife , nee Wurmb (1743–1823). Two sons Karl Friedrich Ludwig (1793–1857) and Ernst Friedrich Wilhelm (1796–1841) and two daughters Karoline Luise Henriette (1799–1850) and Luise Henriette Emilie (1804–1872) were born between 1793 and 1804. The last living descendant of Schiller was a grandchild of Emilie, Baron Alexander von Gleichen-Rußwurm (1865–1947), who died at Baden-Baden, Germany, in 1947.

==Weimar and later career==
Schiller returned with his family to Weimar from Jena in 1799. Goethe convinced him to return to playwriting. He and Goethe founded the Weimar Theater, which became the leading theater in Germany. Their collaboration helped lead to a renaissance of drama in Germany.

For his achievements, Schiller was ennobled in 1802 by the Duke of Saxe-Weimar, adding the nobiliary particle &quot;von&quot; to his name. He remained in Weimar, Saxe-Weimar until his death at 45 from tuberculosis in 1805.

==Legacy and honors==

The first authoritative biography of Schiller was by his sister-in-law Caroline von Wolzogen in 1830, &quot;&quot; (Schiller&#x27;s Life).

The coffin containing what was purportedly Schiller&#x27;s skeleton was brought in 1827 into the Weimarer Fürstengruft (Weimar&#x27;s Ducal Vault), the burial place of the house of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach in the Historical Cemetery of Weimar and later also Goethe&#x27;s resting place. On 3 May 2008, scientists announced that DNA tests have shown that the skull of this skeleton is not Schiller&#x27;s, and his tomb is now vacant. The physical resemblance between this skull and the extant death mask as well as to portraits of Schiller, had led many experts to believe that the skull was Schiller&#x27;s.
The city of Stuttgart erected in 1839 a statue in his memory on a square renamed Schillerplatz. A Schiller monument was unveiled on Berlin&#x27;s Gendarmenmarkt in 1871.

The German-American community of New York City donated a bronze sculpture of Schiller to Central Park in 1859. It was Central Park&#x27;s first installed sculpture.

Chicago dedicated a statue to Schiller in its Lincoln Park.

Schiller Park in Columbus, Ohio is named for Schiller, and has been centered on a statue of his likeness since it was donated in 1891. During the First World War, the name of the park was changed to Washington Park in response to anti-German sentiment, but was changed back several years later. It is the primary park for the South Side neighborhood of German Village.

There is a Friedrich Schiller statue on Belle Isle in Detroit, Michigan. This statue of the German playwright was commissioned by Detroit&#x27;s German-American community in 1908 at a cost of $12,000; the designer was Herman Matzen.

An Ignatium Taschner bronze of Johann Christoph Friedrich von Schiller stands in Como Park - Saint Paul, MN. It was dedicated in 1907. The sculpture was donated by U.S. German Societies of Saint Paul and private citizens of German descent to commemorate the renowned Johann von Schiller.

His image has appeared on several coins and banknotes in Germany, including the 1964 German Democratic Republic 10 Mark banknotes, 1972 German Democratic Republic 20 Mark commemorative coins, and 1934 German Reich 5 Reichsmark commemorative coins.

In September 2008, the German-French TV channel Arte conducted a poll among its viewers to determine the greatest European playwright (&quot;King of Drama&quot;). Schiller was voted in second place after William Shakespeare.

On 10 November 2019, Google celebrated his 260th birthday with a Google Doodle.

==Siblings ==
Friedrich Schiller had five sisters, two of whom died in childhood and three of whom lived to adulthood:
* Elizabeth Christophine Friederike Schiller (1757–1847) – painter, was married librarian (1737–1815), no children.
* Louisa Dorothea Catharina Schiller (1766–1836) – married the pastor Johann Gottlieb Franckh (1760–1834).
* Marie Charlotte Schiller (1768–1774)
* Beata Friederike Schiller (1773)
* Caroline Christiane Schiller (1777–1796)

==Writing==
===Philosophical papers===

Schiller wrote many philosophical papers on ethics and aesthetics. He synthesized the thought of Immanuel Kant with the thought of the German idealist philosopher, Karl Leonhard Reinhold. He elaborated upon Christoph Martin Wieland&#x27;s concept of &#x27; (the beautiful soul), a human being whose emotions have been educated by reason, so that &#x27; (duty and inclination) are no longer in conflict with one another; thus beauty, for Schiller, is not merely an aesthetic experience, but a moral one as well: the Good is the Beautiful. The link between morality and aesthetics also occurs in Schiller&#x27;s controversial poem, &quot;Die Götter Griechenlandes&quot; (The Gods of Greece). The &quot;gods&quot; in Schiller&#x27;s poem are thought by modern scholars to represent moral and aesthetic values, which Schiller tied to Paganism and an idea of enchanted nature. In this respect, Schiller&#x27;s aesthetic doctrine shows the influence of Christian theosophy.

There is general consensus among scholars that it makes sense to think of Schiller as a liberal, and he is frequently cited as a cosmopolitan thinker. Schiller&#x27;s philosophical work was particularly concerned with the question of human freedom, a preoccupation which also guided his historical research, such as on the Thirty Years&#x27; War and the Dutch Revolt, and then found its way as well into his dramas: the &quot;Wallenstein&quot; trilogy concerns the Thirty Years&#x27; War, while &quot;Don Carlos&quot; addresses the revolt of the Netherlands against Spain. Schiller wrote two important essays on the question of the sublime (&quot;), entitled &quot; and &quot;&quot;; these essays address one aspect of human freedom—the ability to defy one&#x27;s animal instincts, such as the drive for self-preservation, when, for example, someone willingly sacrifices themselves for conceptual ideals.

===Plays===
Schiller is considered by most Germans to be Germany&#x27;s most important classical playwright. Critics like F. J. Lamport and Erich Auerbach have noted his innovative use of dramatic structure and his creation of new forms, such as the melodrama and the bourgeois tragedy. What follows is a brief chronological description of the plays.
* &quot;The Robbers&quot; (&quot;Die Räuber&quot;): The language of &quot;The Robbers&quot; is highly emotional, and the depiction of physical violence in the play marks it as a quintessential work of Germany&#x27;s Romantic &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; movement. &quot;The Robbers&quot; is considered by critics like Peter Brooks to be the first European melodrama. The play pits two brothers against each other in alternating scenes, as one quests for money and power, while the other attempts to create revolutionary anarchy in the Bohemian Forest. The play strongly criticises the hypocrisies of class and religion, and the economic inequities of German society; it also conducts a complicated inquiry into the nature of evil. Schiller was inspired by the play &quot;Julius of Taranto&quot; by Johann Anton Leisewitz.
* &quot;Fiesco&quot; (&quot;Die Verschwörung des Fiesco zu Genua&quot;):
* &quot;Intrigue and Love&quot; (&quot;Kabale und Liebe&quot;): The aristocratic Ferdinand von Walter wishes to marry Luise Miller, the bourgeois daughter of the city&#x27;s music instructor. Court politics involving the duke&#x27;s beautiful but conniving mistress Lady Milford and Ferdinand&#x27;s ruthless father create a disastrous situation reminiscent of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. Schiller develops his criticisms of absolutism and bourgeois hypocrisy in this bourgeois tragedy. Act 2, scene 2 is an anti-British parody that depicts a firing-squad massacre. Young Germans who refused to join the Hessians and British to quash the American Revolutionary War are fired upon.
* &quot;Don Carlos&quot;: This play marks Schiller&#x27;s entrée into historical drama. Very loosely based on the events surrounding the real Don Carlos of Spain, Schiller&#x27;s Don Carlos is another republican figure—he attempts to free Flanders from the despotic grip of his father, King Phillip. The Marquis Posa&#x27;s famous speech to the king proclaims Schiller&#x27;s belief in personal freedom and democracy.
* The &quot;Wallenstein&quot; trilogy: Consisting of &quot;Wallenstein&#x27;s Camp&quot;, &quot;The Piccolomini&quot;, and &quot;Wallenstein&#x27;s Death&quot;, these plays tell the story of the last days and assassination of the treasonous commander Albrecht von Wallenstein during the Thirty Years&#x27; War.
* &quot;Mary Stuart&quot; (&quot;Maria Stuart&quot;): This history of the Scottish queen, who was Elizabeth I&#x27;s rival, portrays Mary Stuart as a tragic heroine, misunderstood and used by ruthless politicians, including and especially, Elizabeth.
* &quot;The Maid of Orleans&quot; (&quot;Die Jungfrau von Orleans&quot;): about Joan of Arc
* &quot;The Bride of Messina&quot; (&quot;Die Braut von Messina&quot;)
* &quot;William Tell&quot; (&quot;Wilhelm Tell&quot;)
* &quot;Demetrius&quot; (unfinished)

===&quot;Aesthetic Letters&quot;===

A pivotal work by Schiller was &quot;On the Aesthetic Education of Man in a Series of Letters&quot; (&quot;Über die ästhetische Erziehung des Menschen in einer Reihe von Briefen&quot;), first published 1794, which was inspired by the great disenchantment Schiller felt about the French Revolution, its degeneration into violence and the failure of successive governments to put its ideals into practice. Schiller wrote that &quot;a great moment has found a little people&quot;; he wrote the &quot;Letters&quot; as a philosophical inquiry into what had gone wrong, and how to prevent such tragedies in the future. In the &quot;Letters&quot; he asserts that it is possible to elevate the moral character of a people, by first touching their souls with beauty, an idea that is also found in his poem &quot;Die Künstler&quot; (&quot;The Artists&quot;): &quot;Only through Beauty&#x27;s morning-gate, dost thou penetrate the land of knowledge.&quot;

On the philosophical side, &quot;Letters&quot; put forth the notion of &quot;der sinnliche Trieb / Sinnestrieb&quot; (&quot;the sensuous drive&quot;) and &quot;Formtrieb&quot; (&quot;the formal drive&quot;). In a comment to Immanuel Kant&#x27;s philosophy, Schiller transcends the dualism between &quot;Formtrieb&quot; and &quot;Sinnestrieb&quot; with the notion of &quot;Spieltrieb&quot; (&quot;the play drive&quot;), derived from, as are a number of other terms, Kant&#x27;s &quot;Critique of the Faculty of Judgment&quot;. The conflict between man&#x27;s material, sensuous nature and his capacity for reason (&quot;Formtrieb&quot; being the drive to impose conceptual and moral order on the world), Schiller resolves with the happy union of &quot;Formtrieb&quot; and &quot;Sinnestrieb&quot;, the &quot;play drive&quot;, which for him is synonymous with artistic beauty, or &quot;living form&quot;. Modern interpretations consider Schiller to be one of the earliest known pansexual figures due to these ideals. On the basis of &quot;Spieltrieb&quot;, Schiller sketches in &quot;Letters&quot; a future &quot;ideal state&quot; (a eutopia), where everyone will be content, and everything will be beautiful, thanks to the free play of &quot;Spieltrieb&quot;. Schiller&#x27;s focus on the dialectical interplay between &quot;Formtrieb&quot; and &quot;Sinnestrieb&quot; has inspired a wide range of succeeding aesthetic philosophical theory, including notably Jacques Rancière&#x27;s conception of the &quot;aesthetic regime of art&quot;, as well as social philosophy in Herbert Marcuse. In the second part of his important work &quot;Eros and Civilization&quot;, Marcuse finds Schiller&#x27;s notion of &quot;Spieltrieb&quot; useful in thinking a social situation without the condition of modern social alienation. He writes, &quot;Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Letters&quot; ... aim at remaking of civilization by virtue of the liberating force of the aesthetic function: it is envisaged as containing the possibility of a new reality principle.&quot;

===Freemasonry===
Some Freemasons speculate that Schiller was a Freemason, but this has not been proven. In 1787, in his tenth letter about &quot;Don Carlos&quot;, Schiller wrote: &quot;I am neither Illuminatus nor Mason, but if the fraternization has a moral purpose in common with one another, and if this purpose for human society is the most important, ...&quot; In a letter from 1829, two Freemasons from Rudolstadt complain about the dissolving of their Lodge &quot;Günther zum stehenden Löwen&quot; that was honoured by the initiation of Schiller. According to Schiller&#x27;s great-grandson Alexander von Gleichen-Rußwurm, Schiller was brought to the lodge by Wilhelm Heinrich Karl von Gleichen-Rußwurm. No membership document has been found.

==Musical settings==
Ludwig van Beethoven said that a great poem is more difficult to set to music than a merely good one because the composer must rise higher than the poet – &quot;who can do that in the case of Schiller? In this respect Goethe is much easier,&quot; wrote Beethoven.

There are relatively few famous musical settings of Schiller&#x27;s poems. Notable exceptions are Beethoven&#x27;s setting of &quot;An die Freude&quot; (&quot;Ode to Joy&quot;) in the final movement of his Ninth Symphony, Johannes Brahms&#x27; choral setting of &quot;Nänie&quot;, and &quot;Des Mädchens Klage&quot; by Franz Schubert, who set 44 of Schiller&#x27;s poems as Lieder, mostly for voice and piano, also including &quot;Die Bürgschaft&quot;.

The Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi admired Schiller greatly and adapted several of his stage plays for his operas:
* &quot;I masnadieri&quot; is based on &quot;The Robbers&quot;
* &quot;Giovanna d&#x27;Arco&quot; is based on &quot;The Maid of Orleans&quot;
* &quot;Luisa Miller&quot; is based on &quot;Intrigue and Love&quot;
* &quot;La forza del destino&quot; is based partly on &quot;Wallenstein&#x27;s Camp&quot;
* &quot;Don Carlos&quot; is based on the play of the same title
Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Maria Stuarda&quot; is based on &quot;Mary Stuart&quot;; Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Guillaume Tell&quot; is an adaptation of &quot;William Tell&quot;. Nicola Vaccai&#x27;s &quot;Giovanna d&#x27;Arco&quot; (1827) is based on &quot;The Maid of Orleans&quot;, and his &quot;La sposa di Messina&quot; (1839) on &quot;The Bride of Messina&quot;. Bruch’s The Lay of the Bell is also based on a poem by Schiller. Elise Schmezer (1810–1856) used Schiller’s text for her Lied “Das Geheimnis”. Tchaikovsky&#x27;s 1881 opera &quot;The Maid of Orleans&quot; is partly based on Schiller&#x27;s work. In 1923, German composer Frieda Schmitt-Lermann wrote the music for a theatre production (&quot;Das Lied von der Glocke)&quot; based on Schiller&#x27;s text. German-Russian composer Zinaida Petrovna Ziberova created a musical setting for Schiler&#x27;s &quot;William Tell&quot; in 1935.

<text>Jean Marie Lucien Pierre Anouilh (; ; 23 June 1910 – 3 October 1987) was a French dramatist and screenwriter whose career spanned five decades. Though his work ranged from high drama to absurdist farce, Anouilh is best known for his 1944 play &quot;Antigone&quot;, an adaptation of Sophocles&#x27; classical drama, that was seen as an attack on Marshal Pétain&#x27;s Vichy government. His plays are less experimental than those of his contemporaries, having clearly organized plot and eloquent dialogue. One of France&#x27;s most prolific writers after World War II, much of Anouilh&#x27;s work deals with themes of maintaining integrity in a world of moral compromise.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Anouilh was born in Cérisole, a small village on the outskirts of Bordeaux, France and had Basque ancestry. His father, François Anouilh, was a tailor, and Anouilh maintained that he inherited from him a pride in conscientious craftmanship. He may owe his artistic bent to his mother, Marie-Magdeleine, a violinist who supplemented the family&#x27;s meager income by playing summer seasons in the casino orchestra in the nearby seaside resort of Arcachon. Marie-Magdeleine worked the night shifts in the music-hall orchestras and sometimes accompanied stage presentations, affording Anouilh ample opportunity to absorb the dramatic performances from backstage. He often attended rehearsals and solicited the resident authors to let him read scripts until bedtime. He first tried his hand at playwriting here, at the age of 12, though his earliest works do not survive.

In 1918 the family moved to Paris where the young Anouilh received his secondary education at the Lycée Chaptal. Jean-Louis Barrault, later a major French director, was a pupil there at the same time and recalls Anouilh as an intense, rather dandified figure who hardly noticed a boy some two years younger than himself. He earned acceptance into the law school at the Sorbonne but, unable to support himself financially, he left after just 18 months to seek work as a copywriter at the advertising agency Publicité Damour. He liked the work, and spoke more than once with wry approval of the lessons in the classical virtues of brevity and precision of language he learned while drafting advertising copy.

Anouilh&#x27;s financial troubles continued after he was called up to military service in 1929. Supported by only his meager conscription salary, Anouilh married the actress Monelle Valentin in 1931. Though Valentin starred in many of his plays, Anouilh&#x27;s daughter Caroline (from his second marriage), claims that the marriage was not a happy one. Anouilh&#x27;s youngest daughter Colombe even claims that there was never an official marriage between Anouilh and Valentin. She allegedly had multiple extramarital affairs, which caused Anouilh much pain and suffering. The infidelity weighed heavily on the dramatist as a result of the uncertainty about his own parentage. According to Caroline, Anouilh had learned that his mother had had a lover at the theatre in Arcachon who was actually his biological father. In spite of this, Anouilh and Valentin had a daughter, Catherine, in 1934 who followed the pair into theatre work at an early age. Anouilh&#x27;s growing family placed further strain on his already limited finances. Determined to break into writing full-time, he began to write comic scenes for the cinema to supplement their income.

===Theatre work===
At the age of 25, Anouilh found work as a secretary to the French actor and director Louis Jouvet at the Comédie des Champs-Elysées. Though Anouilh&#x27;s boss had happily lent him some of the set furniture left over from the production of Jean Giraudoux&#x27;s play &quot;Siegfried&quot; to furnish his modest home, the director was not interested in encouraging his assistant&#x27;s attempts at playwriting. Jouvet had risen to fame in the early 1930s through his collaborations with the playwright Giraudoux, and together the two worked to shift focus from the authorial voice of the director (which had dominated the French stage since the early twentieth century) back to the playwright and his text.

Giraudoux was an inspiration to Anouilh and, with the encouragement of the acclaimed playwright, he began writing again in 1929. Before the end of the year he made his theatrical debut with &quot;Humulus le muet&quot;, a collaborative project with Jean Aurenche. It was followed by his first solo projects, &quot;L&#x27;Hermine&quot; (&quot;The Ermine&quot;) in 1932 and &quot;Mandarine&quot; in 1933, both produced by Aurélien Lugné-Poe, an innovative actor and stage manager who was then head of the Théâtre de l&#x27;Œuvre. Ruled by the philosophy, &quot;the word creates the decor,&quot; Lugné-Poe let Anouilh&#x27;s lyrical prose shine in front of a backdrop of simple compositions of line and color that created a unity of style and mood.

The plays were not great successes, closing after 37 and 13 performances respectively, but Anouilh persevered, following it up with a string of productions, most notably &quot;Y&#x27;avait un prisonnier&quot; (1935). These works, most in collaboration with the experimental Russian director Georges Pitoëff, were considered promising despite their lack of commercial profits, and the duo continued to work together until they had their first major success in 1937 with &quot;Le voyageur sans bagage&quot; (&quot;Traveller Without Luggage&quot;). In subsequent years, there was rarely a season in Paris that did not prominently feature a new Anouilh play and many of these were also being exported to England and America. After 1938, however, much of Anouilh&#x27;s later work was directed by the prominent Paris scenic designer André Barsacq, who had taken over as director of the Théâtre de l&#x27;Atelier after Charles Dullin&#x27;s retirement in 1940. Barsacq was a champion for Anouilh and their affiliation was a major factor in the playwright&#x27;s continued success after the war.

===Playwright===
In the 1940s, Anouilh turned from contemporary tales to more mythical, classic, and historic subjects. With protagonists who asserted their independence from the fated past, themes during this period are more closely related to the existential concerns of such writers as Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus. The most famous play of this group is &quot;Antigone&quot;, which &quot;established Anouilh as a leading dramatist, not only because of the power with which he drew the classic confrontation between the uncompromising Antigone and the politically expedient Creon, but also because French theatre-goers under the occupation read the play as a contemporary political parable.&quot; His post-war plays dealt with similar concerns and included &quot;Roméo et Jeannette&quot;, &quot;Médée&quot; (&quot;Medea&quot;), and Anouilh&#x27;s Joan of Arc story &quot;L&#x27;Alouette&quot; (&quot;The Lark&quot;), which, in its distinct optimism, rivalled the commercial success of &quot;Antigone&quot;.

Anouilh himself grouped his plays of this period on the basis of their dominant tone, publishing his later works in collected volumes to reflect what he felt &quot;represented the phases of his evolution and loosely resembled the distinction between comedy and tragedy.&quot; &quot;Pièces noires&quot; or &quot;Black plays&quot; were tragedies or realistic dramas and included &quot;Antigone&quot;, &quot;Jézabel&quot;, and &quot;La Sauvage&quot; (&quot;The Restless Heart&quot;). This category typically featured &quot;young, idealistic, and uncompromising protagonists [who] are able to maintain their integrity only by choosing death.&quot; By contrast, Anouilh&#x27;s &quot;pièces roses&quot; or &quot;pink plays&quot; were comedies where fantasy dominated with an atmosphere similar to that of fairy tales. In these plays such as &quot;Le Bal des voleurs&quot; (&quot;Carnival of Thieves&quot;), &quot;Le Rendez-vous de Senlis&quot; (&quot;Dinner with the Family&quot;) and &quot;Léocadia&quot; (&quot;Time Remembered&quot;), the focus is on &quot;the burden of the environment and especially of the past on a protagonist seeking a happier, freer existence.&quot;

Most of Anouilh&#x27;s plays of the late 1940s and into the 1950s become darker and distinctly cruel and, in contrast with his earlier works, begin to feature middle-aged characters who must view life more practically than Anouilh&#x27;s former idealistic youths. The playwright divided the works of this period into &quot;pièces brillantes&quot; (&quot;brilliant plays&quot;) and &quot;pièces grinçantes&quot; (&quot;grating plays&quot;). The first group includes works such as &quot;L&#x27;Invitation au château&quot; (Ring Round the Moon) and &quot;Colombe&quot;, and are typified by aristocratic settings and witty banter. The grating plays like &quot;La Valse des toréadors&quot; (&quot;Waltz of the Toreadors&quot;) and &quot;Le Réactionnaire amoureux&quot; (&quot;The Fighting Cock&quot;) are more bitterly funny, trading clever word play for a darker tone of disillusionment.

Another category Anouilh specifies are his &quot;pièces costumées&quot; (&quot;costume plays&quot;) which include &quot;The Lark&quot;, &quot;La Foire d&#x27;Empoigne&quot; (&quot;Catch as Catch Can&quot;), and &quot;Becket&quot;, an international success, depicting the historical martyr Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury who sought to defend the church against the monarch (and his friend), Henry II of England, who had appointed him to his see. So classified because they share historical &quot;costumed&quot; settings, Anouilh also specifies that these plays must also prominently feature an enlightened protagonist seeking &quot;a moral path in a world of corruption and manipulation.&quot;

Anouilh&#x27;s final period begins with &quot;La Grotte&quot; (&quot;The Cavern&quot;), in which he comments on his own progress as a writer and a theatre artist. The central character is a playwright suffering from writer&#x27;s block who in his frustration recalls the foibles of Luigi Pirandello&#x27;s &quot;Six Characters in Search of an Author&quot;. Anouilh&#x27;s work had always contained hints of metatheatricality, or commentary on the business of theatre within the world of the play, but in his late works these structures became more fully developed as he begins to write primarily about characters who are dramatists or theatre directors. There is also a pronounced link, during this time, of Anouilh&#x27;s emphasis of theatre and the family, displaying intimate relationships that are &quot;more profound and more important than the traditional heightened action of &#x27;theatre. Antoine, the playwright-protagonist of &quot;Cher Antoine; ou, L&#x27;Amour raté&quot; (&quot;Dear Antoine; or, The Love That Failed&quot;), asserts that the world must take notice of these &quot;pièces secrètes&quot; (secret dramas) and Anouilh scholars have proposed this name, &quot;pièces secrètes&quot;, to classify the collected works of his latest period.&quot;

===Political controversy===
Anouilh remained staunchly apolitical for most of his life and career. He served in the military during at least two periods, having been drafted into the French Army in 1931 and 1939. He was a prisoner of war for a short time when the Germans conquered France and willingly lived and worked in Paris during the subsequent German occupation. Because he refused to take sides during France&#x27;s collaboration with the Axis Alliance, some critics have branded him as a potential Nazi sympathiser. This controversy escalated as a result of Anouilh&#x27;s public clashes with the leader of the Free French Forces (and later president of the Fifth Republic), General Charles de Gaulle. In the mid-1940s, Anouilh and several other intellectuals signed a petition for clemency to save the writer Robert Brasillach, who was condemned to death for being a Nazi collaborator. Brasillach was executed by firing squad in February 1945, despite the outcry from Anouilh and his peers that the new government had no right to persecute individuals for &quot;intellectual crimes&quot; in the absence of military or political action. Nevertheless, Anouilh refused to comment on his political views, writing in a letter to the Belgian critic Hubert Gignoux in 1946, &quot;I do not have a biography and I am very happy about it. The rest of my life, as long as God wills it, will remain my personal business, and I will withhold the details of it.&quot;
Anouilh&#x27;s plays provide the most important clues about his political point of view, though their reputation for ambiguity further complicates the matter. For instance, &quot;Antigone&quot; provides an allegorical representation of the debate between the idealistic members of the French Resistance and the pragmatism of the collaborationists. Though many have read the play as having a strong anti-Nazi sentiment, the fact that the Vichy Regime allowed the piece to be performed without censure testifies to the fact that it was potentially seen as supportive of the occupation in its time. Though the playwright romanticizes Antigone&#x27;s sense of honor and duty to what is morally right, in this case resisting the Nazi forces, it can also be said that Anouilh, like Sophocles before him, makes a convincing argument for Creon&#x27;s method of leadership.

===Awards and recognition===
In 1970 his work was recognized with the &quot;Prix mondial Cino Del Duca&quot;. In 2012, the Nobel Records were opened after 50 years and it was revealed that Anouilh was among a shortlist of authors considered for the 1962 Nobel Prize in Literature, along with John Steinbeck (winner), Robert Graves, Lawrence Durrell and Karen Blixen. According to a report in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;It is not clear why Anouilh was passed over, but the French poet Saint-John Perse had taken the Nobel in 1960, meaning that France was well represented on the roster of winners, and &quot;Svenska Dagbladet&quot; reveals that Jean-Paul Sartre, who won the prize in 1964, was starting to be seriously considered as a candidate.&quot;

In 1980, Anouilh was the first recipient of the Grand Prix du Théâtre de l&#x27;Académie française established that year.

==Critical discussion==
By the end of his career, Anouilh&#x27;s reputation outstripped those of some of his contemporaries despite his repertoire remaining mostly confined to theatre and film. Most French dramatists of the 1930s and 1940s, including Anouilh&#x27;s most significant contemporary influence, Giraudoux, not only wrote for the stage but also composed poetry, novels, or essays. Nevertheless, he remained prolific, consistently producing and publishing performance works for more than fifty years.

Anouilh&#x27;s early works were &quot;naturalistic studies of a sordid and corrupt world.&quot; Many of these plays present the reader with the striking and inescapable dichotomy between pragmatism and a sort of transcendent idealism. There is little to no &quot;middle ground of ambiguity&quot; that exists where this conflict asserts itself. This is evidenced in &quot;Le Voyageur Sans Bagage.&quot; The main character Gaston, a World War I veteran who suffers from amnesia, cannot remember the moral depravity of his youth (he slept with his brother&#x27;s wife and severely injured his best friend). This checkered past is invariably at odds with the near-angelic behavior that he now exhibits, and recognition of this truth forces him to leave his former identity behind, unable to reconcile the two sides of himself. In denouncing his past, Gaston reclasses his freedom as an illusion, but one of his own making. He befriends a young English boy and shows him his identifying scar; this gesture allows the boy to describe Gaston to the authorities, thereby claiming him as kin. With a new life and a new family, Gaston has a fresh start. David I. Grossvogel, describes this situation as the &quot;restoration of a childhood paradise lost,&quot; attributing &quot;Le Voyageur Sans Bagage&quot; as the beginning of Anouilh&#x27;s search to justify the unhappiness of his youth. Theatre historian Marvin Carlson agrees, noting that this play epitomizes the &quot;complex tonality and deft dramatic technique&quot; that remained throughout his work, though, he asserts, it was only as the playwright matured that his &quot;dark view of the human condition [reached] its final expression.&quot;

Anouilh disagreed with these somber readings of his best works, however, arguing that, like all great French literature, his plays had found ways to laugh at misfortune. &quot;Thanks to Molière,&quot; Anouilh said, &quot;the true French theatre is the only one that is not gloomy, in which we laugh like men at war with our misery and our horror. This humor is one of France&#x27;s messages to the world.&quot;

Disclosing his thoughts on French theatre and his personal perspective as a playwright, he said that the perception of his work was often misguided:

In the 1950s, Anouilh examined his antagonism with General de Gaulle in &quot;L&#x27;Hurluberlu, ou Le Reactionnaire amoureux&quot; (1958) and &quot;Le Songe du critique&quot; (1960). He began to lose the favor of audiences and critics alike, however, with the emergence of such playwrights as Eugène Ionesco and Samuel Beckett. Though he shared with these authors a &quot;similar desperate vision of human existence,&quot; these new absurdist theatres&#x27; pursuit of alternative dramaturgies made Anouilh&#x27;s semi-realistic plays seem dull and old-fashioned. In the 1980s Anouilh reinvented himself as a director, staging his own plays as well as those of other authors. He died of a heart attack in Lausanne, Switzerland on 3 October 1987. By then divorced from Monelle Valentin, he was survived by his second wife, Nicole Lançon, and four children.

<text>The Hawker Typhoon is a British single-seat fighter-bomber, produced by Hawker Aircraft. It was intended to be a medium-high altitude interceptor, as a replacement for the Hawker Hurricane, but several design problems were encountered and it never completely satisfied this requirement.

The Typhoon was originally designed to mount twelve .303 inch (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns and be powered by the latest engines. Its service introduction in mid-1941 was plagued with problems and for several months the aircraft faced a doubtful future. When the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; brought the new Focke-Wulf Fw 190 into service in 1941, the Typhoon was the only RAF fighter capable of catching it at low altitudes; as a result it secured a new role as a low-altitude interceptor.

The Typhoon became established in roles such as night-time intruder and long-range fighter. From late 1942 the Typhoon was equipped with bombs, these bomb-carrying aircraft being nicknamed &quot;Bomphoon&quot; by the press. From late 1943 RP-3 rockets were added to its armoury. With those weapons and its four 20 mm Hispano autocannon, the Typhoon became one of the Second World War&#x27;s most successful ground-attack aircraft.

==Design and development==

===Origins===

Even as Hurricane production began in March 1937, Sydney Camm embarked on designing its successor. Camm had contacted the Air Ministry and asked what projects Hawker could consider, number two on their list was a single-engined fighter. Two preliminary designs were similar and larger than the Hurricane. These later became known as the &quot;N&quot; and &quot;R&quot; (from the initial of the engine manufacturers), because they were designed for the newly developed Napier Sabre and Rolls-Royce Vulture, engines respectively. Both engines used 24 cylinders and were designed for over ; the difference between the two was primarily in the arrangement of the cylinders – an H-block in the Sabre, and an X-block in the Vulture. Hawker submitted these preliminary designs in July 1937, but were advised by the Director of Technical Development to wait until a formal specification for a new fighter to replace the Spitfire and Hurricane was issued. He also cautioned that while they liked the design, they did not think the wing would be stiff enough. 

In March 1938, Hawker received the complete Specification F.18/37 and invitation to tender for a fighter which would be able to achieve at least at , a ceiling of not less than 35,000 ft and specified a British engine with a two-speed supercharger. The armament fitted was to be twelve .303 inch (7.7 mm) Browning machine guns with 500 rounds per gun, with a provision for alternative combinations of weaponry. As well as Hawker, Gloster, Supermarine and Bristol submitted one or more designs each. Two prototypes of both the Type N and R were ordered on 3 March 1938 Camm and his design team started formal development of the designs and construction of prototypes.

A contract for 500 Vulture and 500 Sabre engined fighters to F.9/37 was placed with Hawker on 10 July 1939. The official names &#x27;Tornado&#x27; and &#x27;Typhoon&#x27; were issued in August and December respectively.

The basic design of the Typhoon was a combination of traditional Hawker construction, as used in the earlier Hawker Hurricane, and more modern construction techniques; the front fuselage structure, from the engine mountings to the rear of the cockpit, was made up of bolted and welded duralumin or steel tubes covered with skin panels, while the rear fuselage was a flush-riveted, semi-monocoque structure. The forward fuselage and cockpit skinning was made up of large, removable duralumin panels, allowing easy external access to the engine and engine accessories and most of the important hydraulic and electrical equipment.

The wing had a span of , with a wing area of . It was designed with a small amount of inverted gull wing bend; the inner sections had a 1° anhedral, while the outer sections, attached just outboard of the undercarriage legs, had a dihedral of °. The airfoil was a NACA 22 wing section, with a thickness-to-chord ratio of 19.5% at the root tapering to 12% at the tip.

The wing possessed great structural strength, provided plenty of room for fuel tanks and a heavy armament, while allowing the aircraft to be a steady gun platform. Each of the inner wings incorporated two fuel tanks; the &quot;main&quot; tanks, housed in a bay outboard and to the rear of the main undercarriage bays, had a capacity of ; while the &quot;nose&quot; tanks, built into the wing leading edges, forward of the main spar, had a capacity of each. Also incorporated into the inner wings were inward-retracting landing gear with a wide track of 13 ft in.

By contemporary standards, the new design&#x27;s wing was very &quot;thick&quot;, similar to the Hurricane before it. Although the Typhoon was expected to achieve over in level flight at 20,000 ft, the thick wings created a large drag rise and prevented higher speeds than the 410 mph at achieved in tests. The climb rate and performance above that level was also considered disappointing. When the Typhoon was dived at speeds of over , the drag rise caused buffeting and trim changes. These compressibility problems led to Camm designing the Typhoon II, later known as the Tempest, which used much thinner wings with a laminar flow airfoil.

===Prototypes===

The first flight of the first Typhoon prototype, &quot;P5212&quot;, made by Hawker&#x27;s Chief test Pilot Philip Lucas from Langley, was delayed until 24 February 1940 because problems with the development of the Sabre engine meant a flight engine did not arrive until December 1939. Although unarmed for its first flights, &quot;P5212&quot; later carried twelve .303 in (7.7 mm) Brownings, set in groups of six in each outer wing panel; this was the armament fitted to the first 110 Typhoons, known as the Typhoon IA. &quot;P5212&quot; also had a small tail-fin, triple exhaust stubs and no wheel doors fitted to the centre-section. On 9 May 1940 the prototype had a mid-air structural failure, at the join between the forward fuselage and rear fuselage, just behind the pilot&#x27;s seat. Philip Lucas could see daylight through the split but instead of bailing out, landed the Typhoon and was later awarded the George Medal.

On 15 May 1940, the Minister of Aircraft Production, Lord Beaverbrook, ordered that resources should be concentrated on the production of five main aircraft types: the Spitfire and Hurricane fighters and the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley, Vickers Wellington and Bristol Blenheim bombers. As a result, development of the Typhoon was slowed, production plans were postponed and test flying continued at a reduced rate.

As a result of the delays the second prototype, &quot;P5216&quot;, first flew on 3 May 1941: &quot;P5216&quot; carried an armament of four belt-fed 20 mm (0.79 in) Hispano Mk II cannon, with 140 rounds per gun and was the prototype of the Typhoon IB series. Specification F.9/37 had been modified to include cannon armament as progress with the Westland Whirlwind cannon fighter (to F.37/35) and Boulton Paul&#x27;s twin-engined turret fighter (F.11/37) with cannon was slow.

In the interim between construction of the first and second prototypes, the Air Ministry had given Hawker an instruction to proceed with the construction of 1,000 of the new fighters. It was felt that the Vulture engine was more promising, so the order covered 500 Tornadoes and 250 Typhoons, with the balance to be decided once the two had been compared.

It was also decided that because Hawker was concentrating on Hurricane production, the Tornado would be built by Avro and Gloster would build the Typhoons at Hucclecote. Avro and Gloster were aircraft companies within the Hawker Siddeley group. As a result of good progress by Gloster, the first production Typhoon &quot;R7576&quot; was first flown on 27 May 1941 by Michael Daunt, just over three weeks after the second prototype.

==Operational service==

===Low-level interceptor===

In 1941, the Spitfire Mk Vs, which equipped the bulk of Fighter Command squadrons, were outclassed by the new Focke-Wulf Fw 190 and suffered many losses. The Typhoon was rushed into service with Nos. 56 and 609 Squadrons in late 1941, to counter the Fw 190. This decision proved to be a disaster, as several Typhoons were lost for unknown reasons and the Air Ministry began to consider halting production of the type.

In August 1942, Hawker&#x27;s second test pilot, Ken Seth-Smith, while deputising for Lucas, carried out a straight and level speed test from Hawker&#x27;s test centre at Langley, and the aircraft broke up over Thorpe, killing the pilot. Sydney Camm and the design team immediately ruled out pilot error, which had been suspected in earlier crashes. Investigation revealed that the elevator mass-balance had torn away from the fuselage structure. Intense flutter developed, the structure failed and the tail broke away. Modification 286 to the structure and the control runs partially solved the structural problem. (The 1940 Philip Lucas test flight incident had been due to an unrelated failing.) Mod 286, which involved fastening external fishplates, or reinforcing plates, around the tail of the aircraft, and eventually internal strengthening, was only a partial remedy, and there were still failures right up to the end of the Typhoon&#x27;s service life. The Sabre engine was also a constant source of problems, notably in colder weather, when it was very difficult to start, and it suffered problems with wear of its sleeve valves, with consequently high oil consumption. The 24-cylinder engine also produced a very high-pitched engine note, which pilots found very fatiguing.

The Typhoon did not begin to mature as a reliable aircraft until the end of 1942, when its excellent qualities – seen from the start by S/L Roland Beamont of 609 Squadron – became apparent. Beamont had worked as a Hawker production test pilot while resting from operations, and had stayed with Seth-Smith, having his first flight in the aircraft at that time. During late 1942 and early 1943, the Typhoon squadrons were based on airfields near the south and south-east coasts of England and, alongside two squadrons with the Griffon-engined Spitfire XII, countered the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s &quot;tip and run&quot; low-level nuisance raids, shooting down a score or more bomb-carrying Fw 190s. Typhoon squadrons kept at least one pair of aircraft on standing patrols over the south coast, with another pair kept at &quot;readiness&quot; (ready to take off within two minutes) throughout daylight hours. These sections of Typhoons flew at or lower, with enough height to spot and then intercept the incoming enemy fighter-bombers. The Typhoon finally proved itself in this role; for example, while flying patrols against these low-level raids, 486 (NZ) Squadron claimed 20 fighter-bombers, plus three bombers shot down, between mid-October 1942 and mid-July 1943.

The first two Messerschmitt Me 210 fighter-bombers to be destroyed over the British Isles were shot down by Typhoons in August 1942. During a daylight raid by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; on London on 20 January 1943, four Messerschmitt Bf 109G-4s and one Fw 190A-4 of JG 26 were destroyed by Typhoons. As soon as the aircraft entered service, it was apparent the profile of the Typhoon resembled a Fw 190 from some angles, which caused more than one friendly fire incident involving Allied anti-aircraft units and other fighters. This led to Typhoons first being marked up with all-white noses, and later with high visibility black and white stripes under the wings, a precursor of the markings applied to all Allied aircraft on D-Day.

===Switch to ground attack===

By 1943, the RAF needed a ground attack fighter more than a &quot;pure&quot; fighter and the Typhoon was suited to the role (and less-suited to the pure fighter role than competing aircraft such as the Spitfire Mk IX). The powerful engine allowed the aircraft to carry a load of up to two bombs, equal to the light bombers of only a few years earlier. The bomb-equipped aircraft were nicknamed &quot;Bombphoons&quot; and entered service with No. 181 Squadron, formed in September 1942.

From September 1943, Typhoons were also armed with four &quot;60 lb&quot; RP-3 rockets under each wing. In October 1943, No. 181 Squadron made the first Typhoon rocket attacks. Although the rocket projectiles were inaccurate and took considerable skill to aim and allow for ballistic drop after firing, &quot;the sheer firepower of just one Typhoon was equivalent to a destroyer&#x27;s broadside&quot;. By the end of 1943, eighteen rocket-equipped Typhoon squadrons formed the basis of the RAF Second Tactical Air Force (2nd TAF) ground attack arm in Europe. In theory, the rocket rails and bomb-racks were interchangeable; in practice, to simplify supply, some 2nd TAF Typhoon squadrons (such as 198 Squadron) used the rockets only, while other squadrons were armed exclusively with bombs (this also allowed individual units to more finely hone their skills with their assigned weapons).

By the Normandy landings in June 1944, 2 TAF had eighteen operational squadrons of Typhoon IBs, while RAF Fighter Command had a further nine. The aircraft proved itself to be the most effective RAF tactical strike aircraft, on interdiction raids against communications and transport targets deep in North Western Europe prior to the invasion and in direct support of the Allied ground forces after D-Day. A system of close liaison with the ground troops was set up by the RAF and army: RAF radio operators in vehicles equipped with VHF radio telegraphy (R/T) travelled with the troops close to the front line and called up Typhoons operating in a &quot;cab rank&quot;, which attacked the targets, marked for them by smoke shells fired by mortar or artillery, until they were destroyed.
Against some of Germany&#x27;s heavier tanks, the rockets needed to hit the thin-walled engine compartment or the tracks to have any chance of destroying or disabling the tank. Analysis of destroyed tanks after the Normandy battle showed a hit-rate for the air-fired rockets of only 4%. In Operation Goodwood (18–21 July), the 2nd Tactical Air Force claimed 257 tanks destroyed. A total of 222 were claimed by Typhoon pilots using rocket projectiles. Once the area was secured, the British &quot;Operational Research Section 2&quot; analysts could confirm only ten out of the 456 knocked out German AFVs found in the area were attributable to Typhoons using rocket projectiles.

At Mortain, in the Falaise pocket, a German counter-attack (Operation Luttich) that started on 7 August threatened Patton&#x27;s break-out from the beachhead; this counter-attack was repulsed by 2nd Tactical Air Force Typhoons and the 9th USAAF. During the course of the battle, pilots of the 2nd Tactical Air Force and 9th USAAF claimed to have destroyed a combined total of 252 tanks. Only 177 German tanks and assault guns participated in the battle and only 46 were lost – of which nine were verified as destroyed by Typhoons, four percent of the total claimed.

However, after-action studies at the time were based on random sampling of wrecks rather than exhaustive surveys, and the degree of overclaim attributed to Typhoon pilots as a result was statistically improbable in view of the far lower known level of overclaim by Allied pilots in air-to-air combat, where claims were if anything more likely to be mistaken. Allied and German witness accounts of Typhoon attacks on German armour indicate that RPs did kill tanks with fair probability. Horst Weber, an SS &quot;panzergrenadier&quot; serving with Kampfgruppe Knaust south of Arnhem in the later stages of Operation Market Garden, recalled that, during a battle with British 43rd Wessex Division on 23 September 1944, &quot;We had four Tiger tanks and three Panther tanks ... We were convinced that we would gain another victory here, that we would smash the enemy forces. But then Typhoons dropped these rockets on our tanks and shot all seven to bits. And we cried... We would see two black dots in the sky and that always meant rockets. Then the rockets would hit the tanks which would burn. The soldiers would come out all burnt and screaming with pain.&quot;

The effect on the morale of German troops caught up in a Typhoon RP and cannon attack was decisive, with many tanks and vehicles being abandoned, in spite of superficial damage, such that, at Mortain, a signal from the German Army&#x27;s Chief of Staff stated that the attack had been brought to a standstill by 13:00 &quot;due to the employment of fighter-bombers by the enemy, and the absence of our own air-support&quot;. The 20 mm cannon also destroyed a large number of (unarmoured) support vehicles, laden with fuel and ammunition for the armoured vehicles. On 10 July at Mortain, flying in support of the US 30th Infantry Division, Typhoons flew 294 sorties in the afternoon that day. They engaged the German formations while the US 9th Air Force prevented German fighters from intervening. Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander, said of the Typhoons; &quot;The chief credit in smashing the enemy&#x27;s spearhead, however, must go to the rocket-firing Typhoon aircraft of the Second Tactical Air Force ... The result of the strafing was that the enemy attack was effectively brought to a halt, and a threat was turned into a great victory.&quot;

Another form of attack carried out by Typhoons was &quot;Cloak and Dagger&quot; operations, using intelligence sources to target German HQs. With medium bombers, 42 Typhoons carried out an attack on 10 June against the headquarters of &quot;Panzergruppe West&quot; wounding the general, killing several staff officers and disrupting a planned counterattack against the Allied forces. One of the most effective of these was carried out on 24 October 1944, when 146 Typhoon Wing attacked a building in Dordrecht, where senior members of the German 15th Army staff were meeting; 17 staff officers and 36 other officers were killed and the operations of the 15th Army were adversely affected for some time afterwards.
On 24 March 1945, over 400 Typhoons were sent on several sorties each, to suppress German anti-aircraft guns and Wehrmacht resistance to Operation Varsity, the Allied airborne crossing of the Rhine that involved two full divisions of 16,600 troops and 1,770 gliders sent across the river. On 3 May 1945, the &quot;Cap Arcona&quot;, the , and the &quot;Deutschland&quot;, large passenger ships in peacetime now in military service, were sunk in four attacks by RAF Hawker Typhoon 1Bs of No. 83 Group RAF, 2nd Tactical Air Force: the first by 184 Squadron, second by 198 Squadron led by Wing Commander John Robert Baldwin, the third by 263 Squadron led by Squadron Leader Martin T. S. Rumbold and the fourth by 197 Squadron led by Squadron Leader K. J. Harding.

The top-scoring Typhoon ace was Group Captain J. R. Baldwin (609 Squadron and Commanding Officer 198 Squadron, 146 (Typhoon) Wing and 123 (Typhoon) Wing), who claimed 15 aircraft shot down from 1942 to 1944. Some 246 Axis aircraft were claimed by Typhoon pilots during the war.

3,317 Typhoons were built, almost all by Gloster. Hawker developed what was originally an improved Typhoon II, but the differences between it and the Mk I were so great that it was effectively a different aircraft, and was renamed the Hawker Tempest. Once the war in Europe was over Typhoons were quickly removed from front-line squadrons; by October 1945 the Typhoon was no longer in operational use, with many of the wartime Typhoon units such as 198 Squadron being either disbanded or renumbered.

===Captured Typhoons===
By 1943, with its change of role to ground attack, the Typhoon was constantly operating over enemy territory: inevitably some flyable examples fell into German hands. The first Typhoon to be flown by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was &quot;EJ956&quot; SA-I of 486 (NZ) Sqn. On 23 March 1943, two aircraft flown by F/O Smith and F/S Mawson were on a &quot;Rhubarb&quot; over France. Just as they were crossing the coast at low altitude, Mawson&#x27;s Typhoon was hit by light flak. He managed to belly-land in a field near Cany-Barville but the aircraft was captured before he could destroy it. The Typhoon was repaired and test flown at Rechlin a German equivalent to RAE Farnborough, and later served as T9+GK with &quot;Zirkus Rosarius&quot;. EJ956 overturned and was written off during a forced landing near Meckelfeld, on 10 August 1944. On 14 February 1944, another Typhoon was captured and later flown in Zirkus Rosarius. JP548 of 174 Squadron force landed after engine failure near Blois, France; the pilot, F/O Proddow, evaded capture. This Typhoon crashed at Reinsehlen on 29 July 1944, killing Feldwebel Gold.

==Modifications 1941–1945==

As was usual with many front line Second World War RAF aircraft, the Typhoon was modified and updated regularly, so that a 1945 production example looked quite different from one built in 1941. In the last months of the war, a number of older aircraft were taken out of storage and overhauled, sometimes seeing active service for the first time; for example, R7771 was from one of the first production batches, built in 1942 with the car-door canopy and other early production features. This Typhoon was delivered to, and served on the Fighter Interception Unit in 1942. In February 1945 &quot;R7771&quot; was listed as being in front line service on 182 Sqn.; by then it was fitted with a clear-view &quot;bubble&quot; hood, rocket rails and other late series features.

===Carbon monoxide seepage===
The first problem encountered with the Typhoon after its entry into service was the seepage of carbon monoxide fumes into the cockpit. In an attempt to alleviate this, longer exhaust stubs were fitted in November 1941 (&quot;Mod [modification] 239&quot;), and at about the same time the port (left) cockpit doors were sealed. The Pilot&#x27;s Notes for the Typhoon recommended that &quot;Unless Mod. No. 239 has been embodied it is most important that oxygen be used &quot;at all times&quot; as a precaution against carbon monoxide poisoning.&quot; Despite the modifications, the problem was never entirely solved, and the standard procedure throughout the war was for Typhoon pilots to use oxygen from engine start-up to engine shut down. In addition to carbon monoxide seepage, pilots were experiencing unpleasantly high cockpit temperatures; eventually a ventilation tube helped alleviate, but did not solve the problem. In addition two small, rear opening vents were added below the port side radio hatch, just below the canopy.

===Tail===
A major problem, afflicting early production Typhoons in particular, was a series of structural failures leading to loss of the entire tail sections of some aircraft, mainly during high-speed dives. Eventually a combination of factors was identified, including harmonic vibration, which could quickly lead to metal fatigue, and a weak transport joint just forward of the horizontal tail unit. The loss of the tailplane of R7692 (having only 11 hours of flight recorded) on 11 August 1942, in the hands of an experienced test pilot (Seth-Smith), caused a major reassessment which concluded that the failure of the bracket holding the elevator mass balance bell crank linkage had allowed unrestrained flutter which led to structural failure of the fuselage at the transport joint.

Starting in September 1942, a steel strap was fitted internally across the rear fuselage transport joint, although this was soon superseded by Mod 286 (modification number 286), in which 20 alloy &quot;fishplates&quot; were riveted externally across the rear fuselage transport joint, while internally some of the rear fuselage frames were strengthened. This was a permanent measure designed to stop rear fuselage structural failures and was introduced on the production line from the 820th aircraft; between December 1942 and March 1943, all Typhoons without Mod 286 were taken out of service and modified. Modified balance weight assemblies were fitted from May 1943. Finally the entire unit was replaced with a redesigned assembly from August 1944.

Although these modifications reduced the numbers of Typhoons being lost due to tail assembly failure, towards the end of the Typhoon&#x27;s life there were more tail failures, this time caused by a change to the undercarriage latch mechanism in late 1944; in high-speed flight the undercarriage fairings were pulled into the slipstream, creating an uneven airflow over the elevators and rudder resulting in tailplane and then rear fuselage structural failure. In total 25 aircraft were lost and 23 pilots killed due to tail failures.

===Canopy===

The Typhoon was first produced with forward-opening &quot;car door&quot; style cockpit doors (complete with wind-down windows), with a transparent &quot;roof&quot; hinged to open to the left. The first 162 Typhoons featured a built-up metal-skinned dorsal fairing behind the pilot&#x27;s armoured headrest; the mast for the radio aerial protruded through the fairing. From mid- to late 1941 the solid metal aft dorsal fairing was replaced with a transparent structure (later nicknamed &quot;The Coffin Hood&quot;), the pilot&#x27;s head armour plate was modified to a triangular shape and the side cut-outs were fitted with armoured glass; the first production Typhoon to be fitted with this new structure was &quot;R7803&quot;. All earlier aircraft were quickly withdrawn and modified. From early 1942 a rear-view mirror was mounted in a perspex blister moulded into the later &quot;car-door&quot; canopy roofs. This modification was not very successful, because the mirror was subject to vibration. Despite the new canopy structure, the pilot&#x27;s visibility was still restricted by the heavy frames and the clutter of equipment under the rear canopy; from August 1943, as an interim measure, pending the introduction of the new &quot;bubble&quot; canopy and cut-down dorsal fairing, the aerial mast and its associated bracing was removed and replaced with a whip aerial further back on the rear fuselage.

Starting in January 1943, &quot;R8809&quot; was used to test a new, clear, one piece sliding &quot;bubble&quot; canopy and its associated new windscreen structure which had slimmer frames which, together with the &quot;cut-down&quot; rear dorsal fairing, provided a far superior all-around field of view to the car-door type. From November 1943 all production aircraft, starting with &quot;JR333&quot;, were to be so fitted. However, the complex modifications required to the fuselage and a long lead time for new components to reach the production line meant that it took some time before the new canopy became standard. In order to have as many Typhoons of 2nd TAF fitted before &quot;Operation Overlord&quot; as possible, conversion kits were produced and used by Gloster, Hawker and Cunliffe-Owen to modify older Typhoons still fitted with the car-door canopy. 

===Long-range fighter and fighter-bomber===

From early 1943 the wings were plumbed and adapted to carry cylindrical drop tanks, increasing the Typhoon&#x27;s range from to up to . This enabled Typhoons to range deep into France, the Netherlands and Belgium. Some units, such as 609 Squadron and 198 Squadron, were able to achieve notable success in air combat and ground attack operations using these long-range Typhoons.

As production continued, the Typhoon&#x27;s role changed from a low-level interceptor fighter to a fighter bomber. Racks capable of carrying bombs were fitted to the wings from October 1942 and were first used operationally by 181 Squadron. By mid-1943, all Typhoons off the production line were capable of carrying bombs. Bigger, solid rubber, grooved &quot;anti-shimmy&quot; tail wheel tyres were introduced in March 1943 on all Typhoons from the 1,001st production aircraft, &quot;EK238&quot;. The new tyres helped to make heavier, bomb-laden Typhoons more manageable during ground manoeuvres. With the introduction of the bomb racks, small extensions were added to the cannon shell case ejector slots. These allowed the casings to drop clear of bombs or drop tanks suspended from the wing racks. Because of the vulnerability of the Typhoon&#x27;s liquid-cooled engine cooling system to ground fire, some of armour was added, lining the sides and bottom of the cockpit and engine compartments, as well as the radiator bath.

With the added weight of the bombs and armour, bigger brake discs were fitted to the main wheels. At first this only applied to &quot;Bombphoons&quot;, but eventually all Typhoons used these brakes. After tests conducted in 1943, it was determined that the Typhoon was capable of carrying a bomb under each wing. With the increased load, it was decided that the extra take-off performance conferred by a four-bladed propeller was an advantage. This led to the adoption of a four-bladed propeller unit (de Havilland or Rotol) from early 1944. Coinciding with the new propeller, it was also decided that the larger tailplanes of the Hawker Tempest were to be fitted when tests showed that they improved the handling characteristics of the Typhoon when carrying bombs. Problems were experienced with oil seal leaks from the new propeller unit and a growing number of Typhoons were held in Maintenance Units (MUs) awaiting the arrival of new seals from the U.S. Some 200 Typhoons were manufactured with the new Tempest tails and the three-bladed propeller. A modification programme was inaugurated but it took several months before a majority of operational Typhoons had the four-bladed propeller and enlarged tailplane.

In June 1943, Hawker fitted a Typhoon with four steel &quot;Mark I&quot; rocket rails under each wing. Trials at the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A &amp; AEE) and Air Fighting Development Unit (AFDU) showed that the combination of the RP-3 rocket and the stable, high-speed platform of the Typhoon was promising. Carrying the eight rails and rockets, it was found that the top speed was reduced by , with no adverse handling effects. As a result, the Mk I rails and RP-3s were first fitted to production aircraft of 181 Squadron in October 1943. At first attempts were made to arm Typhoons with either bombs or rockets depending on requirements but it was soon decided that squadrons would specialise. By D-Day, the 2nd TAF was able to field 11 RP (&quot;Rockphoon&quot;) Typhoon squadrons and seven &quot;Bombphoon&quot; squadrons.

Later in 1944, attempts were made to increase the firepower by &quot;double banking&quot; rockets on each rail, enabling the Typhoon to carry 16 rockets. The problems involved in operating Typhoons from 2nd TAF airstrips meant that this was not much used, although some Typhoons did fly operationally with 12 rockets, using double-banked rockets on the inner rails. When extra range was required, Typhoons could also operate carrying a drop tank and two rockets outboard of the tank under each wing. From December 1944, aluminium &quot;Mark III&quot; rails, which weighed per set, replaced the steel Mk Is, which weighed .

In late 1943, Mk III IFF replaced the Mk I and the tailplane tip to fuselage Identification friend or foe (IFF) aerials were replaced by a &quot;bayonet&quot; aerial under the wing&#x27;s centre section. A Beam Approach Beacon System (&quot;Rebecca&quot;) transponder unit was fitted in 1944, with the associated aerial appearing under the centre section.

Once Typhoons started operating from forward landing grounds in Normandy, it was found that the dust clouds stirred up by propeller wash consisted of over 80 percent of hard, abrasive material which was damaging the Sabre engines. The sleeve valves in particular were subject to excessive wear and it was calculated that engines would last for three take-offs. As a result, a &quot;dome deflector&quot; was designed and manufactured at great speed by Napier, and within a week most Typhoons had been fitted with it. In operational service these mushroom-shaped air filters, which became red hot, had a propensity for being blown off the air intake at high speed whenever a Sabre engine backfired. They were soon replaced by drum-shaped filters designed by the RAE and Vokes. These had &quot;cuckoo clock&quot; doors in front, which swung open with the pressure changes caused by engine backfires. This standardised filter became Typhoon Mod.420.

At the end of June 1944, a decision was taken to fit tropical air filters as standard, similar to those fitted to the three Typhoons which had been sent to North Africa in 1943. One thousand sets of the filters were to be manufactured and fitted to front line Typhoons as Mod. 421. It was estimated that these could be fitted to all Typhoons on the production lines by the end of September. Research shows that late Typhoons starting in the &quot;RB---&quot; series were fitted with the filters, as were some rebuilt aircraft from earlier production batches. Mod. 421 appeared as a streamlined rectangular &quot;hump&quot;, just behind the main radiator fairing and between the inner wheel doors, where the updraught carburettor intake was located.

A small, elongated oval static port appeared on the rear starboard fuselage in late 1944. This was apparently used to more accurately measure the aircraft&#x27;s altitude.

One Typhoon, &quot;R8694&quot;, was used by Napier for trials with the more powerful Sabre IV, cooled using an annular radiator and driving a four-bladed propeller. The new engine and radiator arrangement required substantial modifications to the forward fuselage and engine bearer structures. Although a maximum speed of was claimed by Napier, it was decided that the modifications would not be worthwhile, mainly because of the promising development of the Tempest, and because the disruption to Typhoon production would not be sufficiently outweighed by any benefit achieved.

===Sub-variants===
In 1943, one Typhoon, &quot;R7881&quot; was converted to a prototype night fighter (N.F. Mk. IB), fitted with aircraft interception radar (A.I.) equipment, a special night-flying cockpit and other modifications.
Also in 1943, five Typhoons were modified to &quot;Tropical&quot; standard by fitting of an air filter in a fairing behind the main radiator housing. Three underwent trials in Egypt with No. 451 Squadron RAAF, during 1943.

The Typhoon FR IB was developed in early 1944 and was used as a tactical reconnaissance fighter. In this version the port inner cannon was removed and three (one forward-facing and two vertical five-inch) F24 cameras were carried in its place. Few FR IBs were built, and most served with 268 Squadron, starting in July 1944. The aircraft was never popular with the pilots, who preferred the older Mustang Is and IAs, and the inherent engine and airframe vibrations meant that photos were invariably blurred. As a consequence of these problems, the FR IB was phased out in January 1945..

===Naval designs===
In 1941, as Blackburn&#x27;s specification N.11/40 high performance base defence fighter (that was carrier transportable) was delayed, the Admiralty looked at navalised version of the Typhoon as an alternative. The Hawker P.1009 design modified for the purpose had a new centre section, extending the wingspan to over , and thus increasing the wing area; the wings themselves were to be folding units, which swung and folded parallel to the fuselage, with the leading edges pointing upwards, much as did the Grumman F6F Hellcat. The rear fuselage was to be longer and a v-style arrestor hook and associated catapult-launching gear was to be fitted. However it was not thought that the redesign and production would be any faster than proceeding with the N.11/40 and the Hawker &quot;Sea Typhoon&quot; submission was not taken up. The N.11/40, after changes to its role and Centaurus engine replacing the Sabre entered service postwar as the Blackburn Firebrand.

A Typhoon (&quot;DW419&quot;) was later allocated for carrier trials when the idea for using Typhoons (or Tempests) as carrier aircraft due to their stronger construction over the Seafires then in use came up in November 1942. &quot;DW419&quot; crashed in February 1943; by December the view was that the Typhoon was not suited to carrier use due to long take-off run and high stall speed.

==Flight characteristics==

Flight Lieutenant Ken Trott flew Typhoons with 197 Squadron and recalled:

In early March 1943, at Tangmere, the then new Squadron Leader of 486 (NZ) Squadron, Des Scott, flew a Typhoon for the first time:

The performance limitations for speed were noted on the pilot&#x27;s notes, published by the Air Ministry. Indicated airspeed for diving was set at . The Typhoon could, if needed, be flown at with the cockpit &quot;hood&quot; open. Flight with undercarriage and flaps down could be made without incident, at the respective speeds of . Owing to stability problems, when the aircraft was carrying bombs, the speed could not exceed .

Notes for the management of the fuel system stated that indicated airspeeds (IAS) in excess of were not advisable when fitted with auxiliary drop tanks. Tanks were jettisoned at about , but in an emergency, a release at was permitted. Tanks were to be ejected in straight and level flight only. General flying ability was positive. The maximum climbing rate was up to reducing speed by per above this mark. In stability terms, the aircraft was stable &quot;directionally&quot; and &quot;laterally&quot; but slightly unstable longitudinally, except at high speed, when it was just stable. Aileron control was light and effective up to maximum speed, but at very low speed response was sluggish, particularly when carrying ordnance. The elevator control was rather light and should not be used harshly. There was a tendency to &quot;tighten up&quot; in a looping aircraft. If &quot;black out&quot; conditions were accidentally induced in steep turns or aerobatics, the control column was to be pushed forward &quot;firmly&quot;.

Stalling speeds were quite low. The typical Typhoon trait, as with most aircraft at the time, was to drop a wing sharply with flaps either up or down. The stalling speeds varied. The various loads depended on external fittings. All-up weight plus two bombs ( in total) with flaps up could induce a stall at . With flaps down, stall was initiated at . Normal all-up weight () would see stall at and respectively. With all ammunition and nearly all fuel expended () stall occurred at and .

==Surviving aircraft==
Only one complete Hawker Typhoon still survives: serial number &quot;MN235&quot;. Originally on display at the National Air and Space Museum (part of the Smithsonian Institution) in the United States, it was presented to the RAF Museum in Hendon, North London in commemoration of the RAF&#x27;s 50th Anniversary in exchange for a Hawker Hurricane. The aircraft was on loan to the Canada Aviation and Space Museum in Ottawa, Canada. It was briefly on show in the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight hangar at RAF Coningsby, but returned to the Royal Air Force Museum London in November 2018.

Several other partial airframes are extant:
* Typhoon Ib &quot;EJ922&quot;, previously privately-owned, bought by Hawker Typhoon Preservation Group, UK, for incorporation into &quot;RB396&quot;.
* Typhoon Ib &quot;JP843&quot;, Typhoon Legacy Co. Ltd., Canada, undergoing long term airworthy restoration; formerly of the Roger Marley Collection
* Typhoon Ia &quot;JR505&quot;, Brian Barnes Collection, UK
* Typhoon Ib &quot;RB396&quot;/G-TIFY, Hawker Typhoon Preservation Group, undergoing airworthy restoration by Airframe Assemblies on the Isle of Wight and the Aircraft Restoration Company at Duxford

An unidentified cockpit section is on display at the Imperial War Museum Duxford, and another – the only known original &quot;car door&quot; example – is subject to a static restoration by the Jet Age Museum in Gloucester.

A Hawker Typhoon replica on display at the &quot;Mémorial de la Paix&quot; at Caen, France, was constructed using some original components.

===Memorial===
On 9 June 1994, in recognition of the aircraft and crew&#x27;s role in the liberation of Normandy, a Typhoon memorial was dedicated by Major M. Roland Heudier at Noyers-Bocage, France. Also present at the ceremony were General Yves Paul Ezanno DFC and bar and Squadron Leader Denis Sweeting, both former Squadron Leaders of No. 198 Squadron RAF.

<doc id="63747" wikidata="Q36107" url="?curid=63747" title="Muhammad Ali">
<text>Muhammad Ali (; born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr.; January 17, 1942 – June 3, 2016) was an American professional boxer and social activist. A global cultural icon, widely known by the epithet &quot;The Greatest&quot;, he is frequently cited as the greatest boxer of all time. He held the &quot;Ring&quot; magazine heavyweight title from 1964 to 1970, was the undisputed champion from 1974 to 1978, and was the WBA and &quot;Ring&quot; heavyweight champion from 1978 to 1979. In 1999, he was named Sportsman of the Century by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; and the Sports Personality of the Century by the BBC.

Born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky, he began training as an amateur boxer at age 12. At 18, he won a gold medal in the light heavyweight division at the 1960 Summer Olympics and turned professional later that year. He joined the Nation of Islam in the early 1960s, but later disavowed it in the mid-1970s. He won the world heavyweight championship, defeating Sonny Liston in a major upset on February 25, 1964, at age 22. During that year, he denounced his birth name as a &quot;slave name&quot; and formally changed his name to Muhammad Ali. In 1967, Ali refused to be drafted into the military, owing to his religious beliefs and ethical opposition to the Vietnam War, and was found guilty of draft evasion and stripped of his boxing titles. He stayed out of prison while appealing the decision to the Supreme Court, where his conviction was overturned in 1971. He did not fight for nearly four years and lost a period of peak performance as an athlete. Ali&#x27;s actions as a conscientious objector to the Vietnam War made him an icon for the larger counterculture of the 1960s generation, and became a prominent, high-profile figure of racial pride for African Americans during the civil rights movement and throughout his career. 

He fought in several historic boxing matches, including his highly publicized fights with Sonny Liston, Joe Frazier (including the Fight of the Century, the biggest boxing event up until then), the Thrilla in Manila, and his fight with George Foreman in The Rumble in the Jungle. Ali thrived in the spotlight at a time when many boxers let their managers do the talking, and he became renowned for his provocative and outlandish persona. He was famous for trash-talking, often free-styled with rhyme schemes and spoken word poetry, and has been recognized as a pioneer in hip hop. He often predicted in which round he would knock out his opponent. As a boxer, Ali was known for his unorthodox movement, fancy footwork, head movement, and rope-a-dope technique, among others.

Outside boxing, Ali attained success as a spoken word artist, releasing two studio albums: &quot;I Am the Greatest!&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Adventures of Ali and His Gang vs. Mr. Tooth Decay&quot; (1976). Both albums received Grammy Award nominations. He also featured as an actor and writer, releasing two autobiographies. Ali retired from boxing in 1981 and focused on religion, philanthropy, and activism. In 1984, he made public his diagnosis of Parkinson&#x27;s syndrome, which some reports attributed to boxing-related injuries, though he and his specialist physicians disputed this. He remained an active public figure globally, but in his later years made fewer public appearances as his condition worsened, and was cared for by his family.

==Early life==
Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. () was born on January 17, 1942, in Louisville, Kentucky. He had one brother. He was named after his father, Cassius Marcellus Clay Sr. (1912–1990), who had a sister and four brothers and who himself was named in honor of the 19th-century Republican politician and staunch abolitionist Cassius Marcellus Clay, also from the state of Kentucky. Clay&#x27;s father&#x27;s paternal grandparents were John Clay and Sallie Anne Clay; Clay&#x27;s sister Eva claimed that Sallie was a native of Madagascar. He was a descendant of slaves of the antebellum South, and was predominantly of African descent, with Irish and English family heritage. His maternal great-grandfather, Abe Grady, emigrated from Ennis, County Clare, Ireland. DNA testing performed in 2018 showed that, through his paternal grandmother, Clay was a descendant of the former slave Archer Alexander, who had been chosen from the building crew as the model of a freed man for the &quot;Emancipation Memorial&quot;, and was the subject of abolitionist William Greenleaf Eliot&#x27;s book, &quot;The Story of Archer Alexander: From Slavery to Freedom&quot;.

His father was a sign and billboard painter, and his mother, Odessa O&#x27;Grady Clay (1917–1994), was a domestic helper. Although Cassius Sr. was a Methodist, he allowed Odessa to bring up both Cassius Jr. and his younger brother, Rudolph &quot;Rudy&quot; Clay (later renamed Rahaman Ali), as Baptists. Cassius Jr. attended Central High School in Louisville. He was dyslexic, which led to difficulties in reading and writing, at school and for much of his life.

He grew up amid racial segregation. His mother recalled one occasion when he was denied a drink of water at a store: &quot;They wouldn&#x27;t give him one because of his color. That really affected him.&quot; He was also strongly affected by the 1955 murder of Emmett Till, which led to young Clay and a friend taking out their frustration by vandalizing a local rail yard. He once told his daughter Hana, &quot;Nothing would ever shake me up (more) than the story of Emmett Till.&quot;

==Amateur career==
Clay was first directed toward boxing by Louisville police officer and boxing coach Joe E. Martin, who encountered the 12-year-old fuming over a thief having taken his bicycle. He told the officer he was going to &quot;whup&quot; the thief. The officer told Clay he had better learn how to box first. Initially, Clay did not take up Martin&#x27;s offer, but after seeing amateur boxers on a local television boxing program called &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Champions&quot;, Clay was interested in the prospect of fighting. He then began to work with trainer Fred Stoner, whom he credits with giving him the &quot;real training&quot;, eventually molding &quot;my style, my stamina and my system&quot;. For the last four years of Clay&#x27;s amateur career he was trained by boxing cutman Chuck Bodak.

Clay made his amateur boxing debut in 1954 against local amateur boxer Ronnie O&#x27;Keefe. He won by split decision. He went on to win six Kentucky Golden Gloves titles, two national Golden Gloves titles, an Amateur Athletic Union national title, and the light heavyweight gold medal in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. Clay&#x27;s amateur record was 100 wins with five losses. In his 1975 autobiography he recalled that shortly after his return from the Rome Olympics, he threw his gold medal into the Ohio River after he and a friend were refused service at a &quot;whites-only&quot; restaurant and fought with a white gang. The story was later disputed, and several of his friends, including Bundini Brown and photographer Howard Bingham, denied it. Brown told &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; writer Mark Kram, &quot;Honkies sure bought into that one!&quot; Thomas Hauser&#x27;s biography of Ali stated that Ali was refused service at the diner but that he lost his medal a year after he won it. Ali received a replacement medal at the Georgia Dome during the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, where he lit the torch to start the Games.

==Professional career==
===Early career===

Clay made his professional debut on October 29, 1960, winning a six-round decision over Tunney Hunsaker. From then until the end of 1963, Clay amassed a record of 19–0 with 15 wins by knockout. He defeated boxers including Tony Esperti, Jim Robinson, Donnie Fleeman, Alonzo Johnson, George Logan, Willi Besmanoff, LaMar Clark, Doug Jones, and Henry Cooper. Clay also beat his former trainer and veteran boxer Archie Moore in a 1962 match.

These early fights were not without trials. Clay was knocked down by both Sonny Banks and Cooper. In the Cooper fight, Clay was floored by a left hook at the end of round four and was saved by the bell, going on to win in the predicted fifth round due to Cooper&#x27;s severely cut eye. The fight with Doug Jones on March 13, 1963, was Clay&#x27;s toughest fight during this stretch. The number two and three heavyweight contenders respectively, Clay and Jones fought on Jones&#x27; home turf at New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. Jones staggered Clay in the first round, and the unanimous decision for Clay was greeted by boos and a rain of debris thrown into the ring. Watching on closed-circuit TV, heavyweight champ Sonny Liston quipped that if he fought Clay he (Liston) might get locked up for murder. The fight was later named &quot;Fight of the Year&quot; by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine.

In each of these fights, Clay vocally belittled his opponents and vaunted his abilities. He called Jones &quot;an ugly little man&quot; and Cooper a &quot;bum&quot;. He said he was embarrassed to get in the ring with Alex Miteff and claimed that Madison Square Garden was &quot;too small for me&quot;. Ali&#x27;s trash talk was inspired by professional wrestler &quot;Gorgeous George&quot; Wagner&#x27;s, after he saw George&#x27;s talking ability attract huge crowds to events. In a 1969 interview he stated that he met with George in Las Vegas in 1961, that George told him that talking a big game would earn paying fans who either wanted to see him win or wanted to see him lose, thus Clay transformed himself into a self-described &quot;big-mouth and a bragger&quot;.

In 1960, Clay left Moore&#x27;s camp, partially due to Clay&#x27;s refusal to do chores such as washing dishes and sweeping. To replace Moore, Clay hired Angelo Dundee to be his trainer. Clay had met Dundee in February 1957 during Clay&#x27;s amateur career. Around this time, Clay sought longtime idol Sugar Ray Robinson to be his manager, but was rebuffed.

===World heavyweight champion===
====Fights against Liston====

By late 1963, Clay had become the top contender for Sonny Liston&#x27;s title. The fight was set for February 25, 1964, in Miami Beach. Liston was an intimidating personality, a dominating fighter with a criminal past and ties to the mob. Based on Clay&#x27;s uninspired performance against Jones and Cooper in his previous two fights, and Liston&#x27;s destruction of former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson in two first-round knockouts, Clay was an 8:1 underdog. Despite this, Clay taunted Liston during the pre-fight buildup, dubbing him &quot;the big ugly bear&quot;, claiming &quot;Liston even smells like a bear&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m gonna give him to the local zoo after I whup him.&quot; Clay turned the pre-fight weigh-in into a circus, shouting at Liston that &quot;someone is going to die at ringside tonight.&quot; Clay&#x27;s pulse rate was measured at 120, more than double his normal 54. Many of those in attendance thought Clay&#x27;s behavior stemmed from fear, and some commentators wondered if he would show up for the bout.

The outcome of the fight was a major upset. At the opening bell, Liston rushed at Clay, seemingly angry and looking for a quick knockout. However, Clay&#x27;s superior speed and mobility enabled him to elude Liston, making the champion miss and look awkward. At the end of the first round, Clay opened up his attack and hit Liston repeatedly with jabs. Liston fought better in round two, but at the beginning of the third round Clay hit Liston with a combination that buckled his knees and opened a cut under his left eye. This was the first time Liston had ever been cut. At the end of round four, Clay was returning to his corner when he began experiencing blinding pain in his eyes and asked his trainer, Angelo Dundee, to cut off his gloves. Dundee refused. It has been speculated that the problem was due to ointment used to seal Liston&#x27;s cuts, perhaps deliberately applied by his corner to his gloves. Though unconfirmed, boxing historian Bert Sugar said that two of Liston&#x27;s opponents also complained about their eyes &quot;burning&quot;.

Despite Liston&#x27;s attempts to knock out a blinded Clay, Clay was able to survive the fifth round until sweat and tears rinsed the irritation from his eyes. In the sixth, Clay dominated, hitting Liston repeatedly. Liston did not answer the bell for the seventh round, and Clay was declared the winner by TKO. Liston stated that the reason he quit was an injured shoulder. Following the win, a triumphant Clay rushed to the edge of the ring and, pointing to the ringside press, shouted: &quot;Eat your words!&quot; He added, &quot;I am the greatest! I shook up the world. I&#x27;m the prettiest thing that ever lived.&quot;

At ringside post fight, Clay appeared unconvinced that the fight was stopped due to a Liston shoulder injury, saying that the only injury Liston had was &quot;an open eye, a big cut eye!&quot; When told by Joe Louis that the injury was a &quot;left arm thrown out of its socket,&quot; Clay quipped, &quot;Yeah, swinging at nothing, who wouldn&#x27;t?&quot;

In winning this fight at the age of 22, Clay became the youngest boxer to take the title from a reigning heavyweight champion. However, Floyd Patterson remained the youngest to win the heavyweight championship, doing so at the age 21 during an elimination bout following Rocky Marciano&#x27;s retirement. Mike Tyson broke both records in 1986 when he defeated Trevor Berbick to win the heavyweight title at age 20. The feat also made Clay the fastest boxer to win the championship (non-vacant) in the modern era, doing so in 20 bouts.

Soon after the Liston fight, Clay changed his name to Cassius X, and then later to Muhammad Ali upon converting to the Nation of Islam. Ali then faced a rematch with Liston scheduled for May 1965 in Lewiston, Maine. It had been scheduled for Boston the previous November, but was postponed for six months due to Ali&#x27;s emergency surgery for a hernia three days before. The fight was controversial. Midway through the first round, Liston was knocked down by a difficult-to-see blow the press dubbed a &quot;phantom punch&quot;. Referee Jersey Joe Walcott did not begin the count immediately after the knockdown, as Ali refused to retreat to a neutral corner. Liston rose after he had been down for about 20 seconds, and the fight momentarily continued. However a few seconds later Walcott, having been informed by the timekeepers that Liston had been down for a count of 10, stopped the match and declared Ali the winner by knockout. The entire fight lasted less than two minutes.

It has since been speculated that Liston purposely dropped to the ground. Proposed motivations include threats on his life from the Nation of Islam, that he had bet against himself and that he &quot;took a dive&quot; to pay off debts. Slow-motion replays show that Liston was jarred by a chopping right from Ali, although it is unclear whether the blow was a genuine knockout punch.

====Fight against Patterson====
Ali defended his title against former heavyweight champion Floyd Patterson on November 22, 1965. Before the match, Ali mocked Patterson, who was widely known to call him by his former name Cassius Clay, as an &quot;Uncle Tom&quot;, calling him &quot;The Rabbit&quot;. Although Ali had the better of Patterson, who appeared injured during the fight, the match lasted 12 rounds before being called on a technical knockout. Patterson later said he had strained his sacroiliac. Ali was criticized in the sports media for appearing to have toyed with Patterson during the fight. Patterson biographer W. K. Stratton claims that the conflict between Ali and Patterson was not genuine but was staged to increase ticket sales and the closed-circuit viewing audience, with both men complicit in the theatrics. Stratton also cites an interview by Howard Cosell in which Ali explained that rather than toying with Patterson, he refrained from knocking him out after it became apparent Patterson was injured. Patterson later said that he had never been hit by punches as soft as Ali&#x27;s. Stratton states that Ali arranged the second fight, in 1972, with the financially struggling Patterson to help the former champion earn enough money to pay a debt to the IRS.

====Main Bout====

After the Patterson fight, Ali founded his own promotion company, Main Bout. The company mainly handled Ali&#x27;s boxing promotions and pay-per-view closed-circuit television broadcasts. The company&#x27;s stockholders were mainly fellow Nation of Islam members, along with several others, including Bob Arum.

Ali and then-WBA heavyweight champion boxer Ernie Terrell had agreed to meet for a bout in Chicago on March 29, 1966 (the WBA, one of two boxing associations, had stripped Ali of his title following his joining the Nation of Islam). But in February Ali was reclassified by the Louisville draft board as 1-A from 1-Y, and he indicated that he would refuse to serve, commenting to the press, &quot;I ain&#x27;t got nothing against no Viet Cong; no Viet Cong never called me nigger.&quot;, although the second part is probably apocryphal. Amidst the media and public outcry over Ali&#x27;s stance, the Illinois Athletic Commission refused to sanction the fight, citing technicalities.

Instead, Ali traveled to Canada and Europe and won championship bouts against George Chuvalo, Henry Cooper, Brian London, and Karl Mildenberger.

Ali returned to the United States to fight Cleveland Williams at the Astrodome in Houston on November 14, 1966. The bout drew a record-breaking indoor crowd of 35,460 people. Williams had once been considered among the hardest punchers in the heavyweight division, but in 1964 he had been shot at point-blank range by a Texas policeman, resulting in the loss of one kidney and of his small intestine. Ali dominated Williams, winning a third-round technical knockout in what some consider the finest performance of his career.

Ali fought Terrell in Houston on February 6, 1967. Terrell, who was unbeaten in five years and had defeated many of the boxers Ali had faced, was billed as Ali&#x27;s toughest opponent since Liston; he was big, strong and had a three-inch reach advantage over Ali. During the lead up to the bout, Terrell repeatedly called Ali &quot;Clay&quot;, much to Ali&#x27;s annoyance. The two almost came to blows over the name issue in a pre-fight interview with Howard Cosell. Ali seemed intent on humiliating Terrell. &quot;I want to torture him&quot;, he said. &quot;A clean knockout is too good for him.&quot; The fight was close until the seventh round, when Ali bloodied Terrell and almost knocked him out. In the eighth round, Ali taunted Terrell, hitting him with jabs and shouting between punches, &quot;What&#x27;s my name, Uncle Tom ... what&#x27;s my name?&quot; Ali won a unanimous 15-round decision. Terrell claimed that early in the fight Ali deliberately thumbed him in the eye, forcing him to fight half-blind, and then, in a clinch, rubbed the wounded eye against the ropes. Because of Ali&#x27;s apparent intent to prolong the fight to inflict maximum punishment, critics described the bout as &quot;one of the ugliest boxing fights&quot;. Tex Maule later wrote: &quot;It was a wonderful demonstration of boxing skill and a barbarous display of cruelty.&quot; Ali denied the accusations of cruelty but, for Ali&#x27;s critics, the fight provided more evidence of his arrogance.

After Ali&#x27;s title defense against Zora Folley on March 22, he was stripped of his title due to his refusal to be drafted to army service. His boxing license was also suspended by the state of New York. He was convicted of draft evasion on June 20 and sentenced to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. He paid a bond and remained free while the verdict was being appealed.

==Draft resistance==
Ali registered for conscription in the United States military on his 18th birthday and was listed as 1-A in 1962. In 1964, he was reclassified as Class 1-Y (fit for service only in times of national emergency) after he failed the U.S. Armed Forces qualifying test because his writing and spelling skills were sub-standard, due to his dyslexia. (He was quoted as saying, &quot;I said I was the greatest, not the smartest!&quot;) By early 1966, the army lowered its standards to permit soldiers above the 15th percentile and Ali was again classified as 1-A. This classification meant he was now eligible for the draft and induction into the U.S. Army at a time when the U.S. was involved in the Vietnam War, a war which put him further at odds with the white establishment.

When notified of this status, Ali declared that he would refuse to serve in the army and publicly considered himself a conscientious objector. Ali stated: &quot;War is against the teachings of the Qur&#x27;an. I&#x27;m not trying to dodge the draft. We are not supposed to take part in no wars unless declared by Allah or The Messenger. We don&#x27;t take part in Christian wars or wars of any unbelievers&quot;. He also said, &quot;We are not to be the aggressor but we will defend ourselves if attacked.&quot; He stated: &quot;Man, I ain&#x27;t got no quarrel with them Vietcong.&quot; Ali elaborated: &quot;Why should they ask me to put on a uniform and go ten thousand miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on brown people in Vietnam while so-called Negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs and denied simple human rights?&quot; Ali antagonized the white establishment in 1966 by refusing to be drafted into the U.S. military, citing his religious beliefs and opposition to American involvement in the Vietnam War.

On April 28, 1967, Ali appeared in Houston for his scheduled induction into the U.S. Armed Forces, but he refused three times to step forward when his name was called. An officer warned him that he was committing a felony punishable by five years in prison and a fine of $10,000. Once more, Ali refused to budge when his name was called, and he was arrested. Later that same day, the New York State Athletic Commission suspended his boxing license and the World Boxing Association stripped him of his title. Other boxing commissions followed suit. Ali remained unable to obtain a license to box in any state for over three years. On June 4, 1967, in a first for sports professionals, a group of high-profile African-American athletes including Jim Brown, Bill Russell, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, as well as one political leader, Carl Stokes, assembled with Ali at the Negro Industrial Economic Union in Cleveland for what became known as the &quot;Cleveland Summit&quot; or the &quot;Muhammad Ali Summit&quot;. The meeting was organized by Brown for his peers to question Ali about the seriousness of his convictions, and to decide whether to support him, which they ultimately did.

At the trial on June 20, 1967, the jury found Ali guilty after only 21minutes of deliberation of the criminal offense of violating the Selective Service laws by refusing to be drafted. After a Court of Appeals upheld the conviction, the case was reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1971.

Ali remained free in the years between the Appellate Court decision and the Supreme Court ruling. As public opinion began turning against the war and the Civil Rights Movement continued to gather momentum, Ali became a popular speaker at colleges and universities across the country; this itinerary was rare if not unprecedented for a prizefighter. At Howard University, for example, he gave his popular &quot;Black Is Best&quot; speech to 4,000 cheering students and community intellectuals, after he was invited to speak by sociology professor Nathan Hare on behalf of the Black Power Committee, a student protest group.

On June 28, 1971, the Supreme Court of the United States in &quot;Clay v. United States&quot; overturned Ali&#x27;s conviction by a unanimous 8–0 decision (Justice Thurgood Marshall recused himself, as he had been the U.S. Solicitor General at the time of Ali&#x27;s conviction). The decision was not based on, nor did it address, the merits of Ali&#x27;s claims per se. Rather, the Court held that since the appeal board gave no reason for the denial of a conscientious objector exemption to Ali, that it was therefore impossible to determine which of the three basic tests for conscientious objector status (offered in the Justice Department&#x27;s brief) the appeal board relied on, and Ali&#x27;s conviction must be reversed.

In a 1974 interview, Ali said, &quot;If they say stand and salute the flag I do that out of respect, because I&#x27;m in the country&quot;. Ali would later say, &quot;If America was in trouble and real war came, I&#x27;d be on the front line if we had been attacked. But I could see that [the Vietnam War] wasn&#x27;t right.&quot; He also said, &quot;Black men would go over there and fight, but when they came home, they couldn&#x27;t even be served a hamburger.&quot;

===Impact of Ali&#x27;s draft refusal===
Ali&#x27;s example inspired many black Americans and others. However, initially when he refused induction, he became arguably the most hated man in the country and received many death threats. People who supported Ali during this time were also threatened, including sports journalist Jerry Izenberg, whose columns defended Ali&#x27;s decision not to serve. He wrote, &quot;Bomb threats emptied our office, making the staff stand out in the snow. My car windshield was smashed with a sledgehammer.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; columnist William Rhoden wrote, &quot;Ali&#x27;s actions changed my standard of what constituted an athlete&#x27;s greatness. Possessing a killer jump shot or the ability to stop on a dime was no longer enough. What were you doing for the liberation of your people? What were you doing to help your country live up to the covenant of its founding principles?&quot;

Recalling Ali&#x27;s anti-war position, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar said: &quot;I remember the teachers at my high school didn&#x27;t like Ali because he was so anti-establishment and he kind of thumbed his nose at authority and got away with it. The fact that he was proud to be a black man and that he had so much talent... made some people think that he was dangerous. But for those very reasons I enjoyed him.&quot;

Civil rights figures came to believe that Ali had an energizing effect on the freedom movement as a whole. Al Sharpton spoke of his bravery at a time when there was still widespread support for the Vietnam War:
Ali was honored with the annual Martin Luther King Award in 1970 by civil rights leader Ralph Abernathy, who called him &quot;a living example of soul power, the March on Washington in two fists&quot;. Coretta Scott King added that Ali was &quot;a champion of justice and peace and unity&quot;.

In speaking of the cost on Ali&#x27;s career of his refusal to be drafted, his trainer Angelo Dundee said, &quot;One thing must be taken into account when talking about Ali: He was robbed of his best years, his prime years.&quot; Ali&#x27;s promoter Bob Arum did not support Ali&#x27;s choice at the time, but in 2016 Arum stated: &quot;when I look back at his life, and I was blessed to call him a friend and spent a lot of time with him, it&#x27;s hard for me to talk about his exploits in boxing because as great as they were they paled in comparison to the impact that he had on the world. ... He did what he thought was right. And it turned out he was right, and I was wrong.&quot;

Ali&#x27;s resistance to the draft was covered in the 2013 documentary &quot;The Trials of Muhammad Ali&quot;.

===NSA and FBI monitoring of Ali&#x27;s communications===
In a secret operation code-named &quot;Minaret&quot;, the National Security Agency (NSA) intercepted the communications of leading Americans, including Ali, Senators Frank Church and Howard Baker, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., prominent U.S. journalists, and others who criticized the U.S. war in Vietnam. A review by the NSA of the Minaret program concluded that it was &quot;disreputable if not outright illegal&quot;.

In 1971, Ali&#x27;s Fight of the Century with Frazier was used by an activist group, the Citizens&#x27; Commission to Investigate the FBI, to pull off a burglary at an FBI office in Pennsylvania; the anticipation for the fight was unlike anything else, so they believed the security would also be focused on the fight. This raid exposed the COINTELPRO operations that included illegal spying on activists involved with the civil rights and anti-war movements. One of the COINTELPRO targets was Ali, and their activities included the FBI gaining access to his records as far back as elementary school; one such record mentioned him loving art as a child.

==Exile and comeback==
In March 1966, Ali refused to be inducted into the armed forces. He was systematically denied a boxing license in every state and stripped of his passport. As a result, he did not fight from March 1967 to October 1970—from ages 25 to almost 29—as his case worked its way through the appeals process before his conviction was overturned in 1971.

=== Protesting while exiled ===
During this time of inactivity, as opposition to the Vietnam War began to grow and Ali&#x27;s stance gained sympathy, he spoke at colleges across the nation, criticizing the Vietnam War and advocating African American pride and racial justice. Ali based himself in Chicago. According to most close to him, his Chicago years were formative.

At the time, Ali was widely condemned by the American media, with fears that his actions could potentially lead to mass civil disobedience. Despite this, &quot;Ebony&quot; magazine noted in the late 1960s that Ali&#x27;s popularity had increased during this time, especially among black people.

===&quot;The Super Fight&quot;===

While banned from sanctioned bouts, Ali settled a $1 million lawsuit against radio producer Murray Woroner by accepting $10,000 to appear in a privately staged fantasy fight against retired champion Rocky Marciano. In 1969 the boxers were filmed sparring for about 75 one-minute rounds; they produced several potential outcomes. A computer program purportedly determined the winner, based on data about the fighters, along with the opinions of approximately 250 boxing experts. Edited versions of the bout were shown in movie theaters in 1970. In the U.S. version Ali lost in a simulated 13th-round knockout, but in the European version Marciano lost due to cuts, also simulated.

Ali suggested that prejudice determined his defeat in the U.S. version; he was reported to have jokingly said, &quot;That computer was made in Alabama.&quot;

==Return==
On August 11, 1970, with his case still in appeal, Ali was granted a license to box by the City of Atlanta Athletic Commission. Leroy Johnson, Jesse Hill Jr. and Harry Pett had used their local political influence and set up the company House of Sports to organize the fight, underlining the influential power of Georgia&#x27;s black politics in Ali&#x27;s comeback. Ali&#x27;s first return bout was against Jerry Quarry on October 26, resulting in a win after three rounds after Quarry was cut.

A month earlier, a victory in federal court forced the New York State Boxing Commission to reinstate Ali&#x27;s license. He fought Oscar Bonavena at Madison Square Garden in December, an uninspired performance that ended in a dramatic technical knockout of Bonavena in the 15th round. The win left Ali as a top contender against heavyweight champion Joe Frazier.

===Fight against Joe Frazier===

Ali and Frazier&#x27;s first fight, held at the Garden, was on March 8, 1971, while Ali&#x27;s Supreme Court appeal was still pending. It was nicknamed the &quot;Fight of the Century&quot; due to the tremendous excitement surrounding a bout between two undefeated fighters, each with a legitimate claim to be heavyweight champion. Veteran U.S. boxing writer John Condon called it &quot;the greatest event I&#x27;ve ever worked on in my life.&quot; The bout was broadcast to 36 countries; promoters granted 760 press passes.

Adding to the atmosphere were the considerable pre-fight theatrics and name calling. Before the fight, Frazier called Ali &quot;Cassius Clay,&quot; angering Ali who responded by calling Frazier a &quot;dumb tool of the white establishment&quot; and saying &quot;Frazier is too ugly to be champ. Frazier is too dumb to be champ.&quot; Ali also frequently called Frazier an &quot;Uncle Tom.&quot; Dave Wolf, who worked in Frazier&#x27;s camp, recalled that &quot;Ali was saying &#x27;the only people rooting for Joe Frazier are white people in suits, Alabama sheriffs, and members of the Ku Klux Klan. I&#x27;m fighting for the little man in the ghetto.&#x27; Joe was sitting there, smashing his fist into the palm of his hand, saying, &#x27;What the fuck does he know about the ghetto?

Ali began training at a farm near Reading, Pennsylvania, in 1971 and, finding the country setting to his liking, sought to develop a real training camp in the countryside. He found a five-acre site on a Pennsylvania country road in the village of Deer Lake, Pennsylvania. On this site, Ali carved out what was to become his training camp, where he trained for all his fights from 1972 to the end of his career in 1981.

The Monday night fight lived up to its billing. In a preview of their two other fights, a crouching, bobbing and weaving Frazier constantly pressured Ali, getting hit regularly by Ali jabs and combinations, but relentlessly attacking and scoring repeatedly, especially to Ali&#x27;s body. The fight was even in the early rounds, but Ali was taking more punishment than ever in his career up until that point. On several occasions in the early rounds, he played to the crowd and shook his head &quot;no&quot; after he was hit. In the later rounds—in what was the first appearance of the &quot;rope-a-dope strategy&quot;—Ali leaned against the ropes and absorbed punishment from Frazier, hoping to tire him. In the 11th round, Frazier connected with a left hook that wobbled Ali, but because it appeared that Ali might be clowning as he staggered backwards across the ring, Frazier hesitated to press his advantage, fearing an Ali counterattack. In the final round, Frazier knocked Ali down with a vicious left hook, which referee Arthur Mercante said was as hard as a man can be hit. Ali was back on his feet in three seconds. Nevertheless, Ali lost by unanimous decision, his first professional defeat.

=== After his loss ===
====Chamberlain challenge and Ellis fight====

In 1971, basketball star Wilt Chamberlain challenged Ali to a fight, and a bout was scheduled for July 26. Although the seven-foot-one-inch-tall Chamberlain had formidable physical advantages over Ali—weighing 60pounds more and able to reach 14inches further—Ali was able to influence Chamberlain into calling off the bout by taunting him with calls of &quot;Timber!&quot; and &quot;The tree will fall&quot; during a shared interview. These statements of confidence unsettled his taller opponent, whom Los Angeles Lakers owner Jack Kent Cooke had offered a record-setting contract, conditional on Chamberlain agreeing to abandon what Cooke termed &quot;this boxing foolishness&quot;, and he did exactly that.

Meanwhile, on June 28, 1971, the Supreme Court overturned Ali&#x27;s draft evasion conviction. To replace Ali&#x27;s opponent, promoter Bob Arum quickly booked a former sparring partner of Ali&#x27;s, Jimmy Ellis, who was a childhood friend from Louisville, Kentucky, to fight him. Ali won the bout through a technical knockout when the referee stopped the fight in the twelfth round.

====Fights against Quarry, Patterson, Foster, Bugner and Norton====
After Ellis, Ali fought Jerry Quarry, had a second bout with Floyd Patterson, and faced Bob Foster in 1972, winning a total of six fights that year. During two bouts he had in 1973 with Joe Bugner and Ken Norton, he wore a &quot;People&#x27;s Choice&quot; robe given to him by Elvis Presley. In 1973, before his fight with Norton, Tom Cushman, a boxing writer for the &quot;Philadelphia Daily News&quot;, said Ali was &quot;gloriously overconfident&quot; and didn&#x27;t consider Norton &quot;a threat at all&quot;. But during the fight, either in the second round according to most press reports, or the final round according to Norton, Norton broke Ali&#x27;s jaw and inflicted by decision the second loss of his career. After considering retirement, Ali won a controversial decision against Norton in their second bout. This led to a rematch with Joe Frazier at Madison Square Garden on January 28, 1974; Frazier had recently lost his title to George Foreman.

====Second fight against Joe Frazier====
Ali was strong in the early rounds of the fight, and staggered Frazier in the second round. Referee Tony Perez mistakenly thought he heard the bell ending the round and stepped between the two fighters as Ali was pressing his attack, giving Frazier time to recover. However, Frazier came on in the middle rounds, snapping Ali&#x27;s head in round seven and driving him to the ropes at the end of round eight. The last four rounds saw round-to-round shifts in momentum between the two fighters. Throughout most of the bout, however, Ali was able to circle away from Frazier&#x27;s dangerous left hook and to tie Frazier up when he was cornered, the latter a tactic that Frazier&#x27;s camp complained of bitterly. Judges awarded Ali a unanimous decision.

===World heavyweight champion (second reign)===
====&quot;The Rumble in the Jungle&quot;====

The defeat of Frazier set the stage for a title fight against heavyweight champion George Foreman in Kinshasa, Zaire, on October 30, 1974—a bout nicknamed &quot;The Rumble in the Jungle&quot;. Foreman was considered one of the hardest punchers in heavyweight history. In assessing the fight, analysts pointed out that Joe Frazier and Ken Norton, who had given Ali four tough battles and won two of them, had both been devastated by Foreman in second-round knockouts. Ali was 32 years old and had lost speed and reflexes since his twenties. Contrary to his later persona, Foreman was at the time a brooding and intimidating presence. Almost no one associated with the sport, not even Ali&#x27;s long-time supporter Howard Cosell, gave the former champion a chance of winning.

As usual, Ali was confident and colorful before the fight. He told interviewer David Frost, &quot;If you think the world was surprised when Nixon resigned, wait till I whup Foreman&#x27;s behind!&quot; He told the press, &quot;I&#x27;ve done something new for this fight. I done wrestled with an alligator, I done tussled with a whale; handcuffed lightning, thrown thunder in jail; only last week, I murdered a rock, injured a stone, hospitalized a brick; I&#x27;m so mean I make medicine sick.&quot; Ali was wildly popular in Zaire, with crowds chanting &quot;Ali, bomaye&quot; (&quot;Ali, kill him&quot;) wherever he went.

Ali opened the fight moving and scoring with right crosses to Foreman&#x27;s head. Then, beginning in the second round, and to the consternation of his corner, Ali retreated to the ropes and invited Foreman to hit him while covering up, clinching and counterpunching, all while verbally taunting Foreman. The move, which would later become known as the &quot;Rope-a-dope&quot;, so violated conventional boxing wisdom—letting one of the hardest hitters in boxing strike at will—that at ringside writer George Plimpton thought the fight had to be fixed. Foreman, increasingly angered, threw punches that were deflected and did not land squarely. Midway through the fight, as Foreman began tiring, Ali countered more frequently and effectively with punches and flurries, which electrified the pro-Ali crowd. In the eighth round, Ali dropped an exhausted Foreman with a combination at center ring; Foreman failed to make the count. Against the odds, and amidst pandemonium in the ring, Ali had regained the title by knockout. Reflecting on the fight, George Foreman later said: &quot;I thought Ali was just one more knockout victim until, about the seventh round, I hit him hard to the jaw and he held me and whispered in my ear: &#x27;That all you got, George?&#x27; I realized that this ain&#x27;t what I thought it was.&quot;
It was a major upset victory, after Ali came in as a 41 underdog against the previously unbeaten, heavy-hitting Foreman. The fight became famous for Ali&#x27;s introduction of the rope-a-dope tactic. The fight was watched by a record estimated television audience of 1billion viewers worldwide. It was the world&#x27;s most-watched live television broadcast at the time.

====Fights against Wepner, Lyle and Bugner====
Ali&#x27;s next opponents included Chuck Wepner, Ron Lyle, and Joe Bugner. Wepner, a journeyman known as &quot;The Bayonne Bleeder&quot;, stunned Ali with a knockdown in the ninth round; Ali would later say he tripped on Wepner&#x27;s foot. The fight inspired Sylvester Stallone to create the acclaimed film &quot;Rocky&quot;.

====Third fight against Joe Frazier====

Ali then agreed to a third match with Joe Frazier in Manila. The bout, known as the &quot;Thrilla in Manila&quot;, was held on October 1, 1975, in temperatures approaching . In the first rounds, Ali was aggressive, moving and exchanging blows with Frazier. However, Ali soon appeared to tire and adopted the &quot;rope-a-dope&quot; strategy, frequently resorting to clinches. During this part of the bout Ali did some effective counterpunching, but for the most part absorbed punishment from a relentlessly attacking Frazier. In the 12th round, Frazier began to tire, and Ali scored several sharp blows that closed Frazier&#x27;s left eye and opened a cut over his right eye. With Frazier&#x27;s vision now diminished, Ali dominated the 13th and 14th rounds, at times conducting what boxing historian Mike Silver called &quot;target practice&quot; on Frazier&#x27;s head. The fight was stopped when Frazier&#x27;s trainer, Eddie Futch, refused to allow Frazier to answer the bell for the 15th and final round, despite Frazier&#x27;s protests. Frazier&#x27;s eyes were both swollen shut. Ali, in his corner, winner by TKO, slumped on his stool, spent.

An ailing Ali said afterwards that the fight &quot;was the closest thing to dying that I know&quot;, and, when later asked if he had viewed the fight on videotape, reportedly said, &quot;Why would I want to go back and see Hell?&quot; After the fight he cited Frazier as &quot;the greatest fighter of all times next to me&quot;.

After the third fight with Frazier, Ali considered retirement. He said, &quot;I&#x27;m sore all over. My arms, my face, my sides all ache. I&#x27;m so, so tired. There is a great possibility that I will retire. You might have seen the last of me. I want to sit back and count my money, live in my house and my farm, work for my people and concentrate on my family.&quot;

===Later career===

On February 2, 1976, Ali defeated Jean-Pierre Coopman by 5th round knockout. The WBC Heavyweight title was not on the line for this fight. On April 30, 1976, Ali would fight Jimmy Young and win a controversial unanimous decision. Howard Cosell would remark that he had &quot;never seen Ali so off in his timing&quot; and when asked on his performance against Young in the post-fight interview, Ali stated that he was &quot;getting old&quot; and that he was &quot;preserving his energy&quot; for Ken Norton. On May 24, 1976, Ali defeated Richard Dunn, winning by 5th round technical knockout. The punch used to knock Dunn out was taught to Ali by Taekwondo Grandmaster Jhoon Rhee. Rhee called that punch the &quot;Accupunch&quot;; he learned it from Bruce Lee. The Dunn fight was the last time Ali would knock an opponent out in his boxing career.

Ali fought Ken Norton for the third time in September 1976. The bout, which was held at Yankee Stadium, resulted in Ali winning a controversial decision that ringside commentators had scored in favor of Norton. Afterwards, he announced he was retiring from boxing to practice his faith, having converted to Sunni Islam after falling out with the Nation of Islam the previous year.

After returning to beat Alfredo Evangelista in May 1977, Ali struggled in his next fight against Earnie Shavers that September, getting pummeled a few times by punches to the head. Ali won the fight by another unanimous decision, but the bout caused his longtime doctor Ferdie Pacheco to quit after he was rebuffed for telling Ali he should retire. Pacheco was quoted as saying, &quot;the New York State Athletic Commission gave me a report that showed Ali&#x27;s kidneys were falling apart. I wrote to Angelo Dundee, Ali&#x27;s trainer, his wife and Ali himself. I got nothing back in response. That&#x27;s when I decided enough is enough.&quot;

In February 1978, Ali faced Leon Spinks at the Hilton Hotel in Las Vegas. At the time, Spinks had only seven professional fights to his credit, and had recently fought a draw with journeyman Scott LeDoux. Ali sparred less than two dozen rounds in preparation for the fight and was seriously out of shape by the opening bell. He lost the title by split decision. A rematch occurred in September at the Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. 70,000 people attended the bout and paid a total of $6 million admission, making it the largest live gate in boxing history at that time. Ali won a unanimous decision in an uninspiring fight, with referee Lucien Joubert scoring rounds 10–4, judge Ernie Cojoe 10–4, and judge Herman Preis 11–4. This made Ali the first heavyweight champion to win the belt three times.

Following this win, on July 27, 1979, Ali announced his retirement from boxing. His retirement was short-lived, however; Ali announced his comeback to face Larry Holmes for the WBC belt in an attempt to win the heavyweight championship an unprecedented fourth time. The fight was largely motivated by Ali&#x27;s need for money. Boxing writer Richie Giachetti said, &quot;Larry didn&#x27;t want to fight Ali. He knew Ali had nothing left; he knew it would be a horror.&quot;

It was around this time that Ali started struggling with vocal stutters and trembling hands. The Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) ordered that he undergo a complete physical in Las Vegas before being allowed to fight again. Ali chose instead to check into the Mayo Clinic, who declared him fit to fight. Their opinion was accepted by the NAC on July 31, 1980, paving the way for Ali&#x27;s return to the ring.

====Fight stoppage vs. Larry Holmes====

On October 2, 1980, Ali returned to the ring to fight Holmes at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas. Holmes, who fought under the nickname &quot;The Easton Assassin&quot;, easily dominated Ali. After the tenth round, Angelo Dundee stepped into the ring and instructed the referee to stop the fight. It was the only time Ali ever lost by stoppage.

Immediately after the fight, Ali was given painkillers and antidepressants, in violation of World Boxing Council rules prohibiting the administration of any drug before the postfight urinalysis.

Giachetti called the fight &quot;awful...the worst sports event I ever had to cover&quot;. Actor Sylvester Stallone was ringside for the fight and said that it was like watching an autopsy on a man who is still alive. The Holmes fight is said to have contributed to Ali&#x27;s Parkinson&#x27;s syndrome. Despite pleas to definitively retire, Ali fought one last time on December 11, 1981, in Nassau, Bahamas, against Trevor Berbick, losing a ten-round decision.

==Exhibition bouts==
Ali boxed both well-known boxers and celebrities from other walks of life, including Antonio Inoki, Michael Dokes, Sammy Davis Jr., Richard Pryor, Marvin Gaye, Burt Young, Lyle Alzado, Dave Semenko, and Puerto Rican comedian Jose Miguel Agrelot (with Iris Chacon acting as Agrelot&#x27;s corner-woman).

===Ali vs Inoki===
On June 26, 1976, Ali participated in an exhibition bout in Tokyo against Japanese professional wrestler and martial artist Antonio Inoki. Ali was only able to land two jabs while Inoki&#x27;s kicks caused two blood clots and an infection that almost resulted in Ali&#x27;s leg being amputated, as a result of Ali&#x27;s team insisting on rules restricting Inoki&#x27;s ability to wrestle. Because of this, the fight has been criticized for causing Ali trouble healthwise, mostly in terms of movement, later down the line; Ferdie Pacheco stated &quot;Ali was still feeling the effects of his leg injury, and his mobility was not what it had been&quot;. The match was not scripted and ultimately declared a draw. After Ali&#x27;s death, &quot;The New York Times&quot; declared it his least memorable fight. Most boxing commentators at the time viewed the fight negatively and hoped it would be forgotten as some considered it a &quot;15-round farce&quot;. Today it is considered by some to be one of Ali&#x27;s most influential fights and CBS Sports said the attention the mixed-style bout received &quot;foretold the arrival of standardized MMA years later&quot;. Ali and Inoki began a friendship after the fight.

===Ali vs Alzado===
In 1979, Ali fought an exhibition match against NFL player Lyle Alzado. The fight went 8 rounds and was declared a draw.

===Ali vs Semenko===
Ali fought NHL player, Dave Semenko in an exhibition on June 12, 1983. The match was officially a draw after going three rounds, but the Canadian Press reported Ali was not seriously trying for most of the bout, instead just toying with Semenko.

==Personal life==
===Marriages and children===

Ali was married four times and had seven daughters and two sons. Ali was introduced to cocktail waitress Sonji Roi by Herbert Muhammad, who was to become Ali&#x27;s long-time manager, and asked her to marry him after their first date. They married approximately one month later on August 14, 1964. They quarreled over Sonji&#x27;s refusal to join the Nation of Islam. According to Ali, &quot;She wouldn&#x27;t do what she was supposed to do. She wore lipstick; she went into bars; she dressed in clothes that were revealing and didn&#x27;t look right.&quot; The marriage was childless and they divorced on January 10, 1966. Just before the divorce was finalized, Ali sent Sonji a note: &quot;You traded heaven for hell, baby.&quot; Ali&#x27;s brother Rahaman said that she was Ali&#x27;s only true love and the Nation of Islam made Ali divorce her and Ali never got over it.

On August 17, 1967, Ali married 17-year-old Belinda Boyd. In an interview with NBC 6, Boyd recounted meeting Ali when she was 10 years old at her hometown mosque. Boyd stated Ali signed an autograph for her while humorously remarking on his future fame, saying, “Listen here little girl. This is my name. Imma be famous. You need to keep that &#x27;cause it&#x27;s gone be worth a lot of money.” Boyd said, &quot;You&#x27;ll never be famous with that name. And, I walked away.” Born into a Chicago family that had converted to the Nation Of Islam, she later changed her name to Khalilah Ali, though she was still called Belinda by old friends and family. They had four children: author and rapper Maryum &quot;May May&quot; (born 1968); twins Jamillah and Rasheda (born 1970); and Muhammad Ali Jr. (born 1972). Rasheda married Robert Walsh and has two sons: Biaggio Ali (born 1998), who is an amateur MMA fighter, and Nico Ali (born 2000), who is a professional boxer.

Ali was a resident of Cherry Hill, New Jersey in suburban Philadelphia in the early 1970s. At age 31 in 1973, Ali began an extramarital relationship with 16-year-old Wanda Bolton (who subsequently changed her name to Aaisha Ali) with whom he fathered another daughter, Khaliah (born June 1974). While still married to Belinda, Ali married Aaisha a year later in an Islamic ceremony that was not legally recognized. According to Khaliah, Aaisha and her mother lived at Ali&#x27;s Deer Lake training camp alongside Belinda and her children. In January 1985, Aaisha sued Ali for unpaid palimony. The case was settled when Ali agreed to set up a $200,000 trust fund for Khaliah. In 2001 Khaliah was quoted as saying she believed her father viewed her as &quot;a mistake&quot;. He had another daughter, Miya (born 1972), from an extramarital relationship with Patricia Harvell.
By the summer of 1977, his second marriage ended due to Ali&#x27;s repeated infidelity, and he had married actress and model Veronica Porché. At the time of their marriage, they had a daughter, Hana, and Veronica was pregnant with their second child. Their second daughter, Laila Ali, was born in December 1977, and went on to become a professional boxer. By 1986, Ali and Porché were divorced due to Ali&#x27;s continuous infidelity. Porché said of Ali&#x27;s infidelity, &quot;It was too much temptation for him, with women who threw themselves at him. It didn&#x27;t mean anything. He didn&#x27;t have affairs – he had one-night stands. I knew beyond a doubt there were no feelings involved. It was so obvious, It was easy to forgive him.&quot;

On November 19, 1986, Ali married Yolanda &quot;Lonnie&quot; Williams. Lonnie first met Ali at the age of 6 when her family moved to Louisville in 1963. In 1982, she became Ali&#x27;s primary caregiver and in return, he paid for her to attend graduate school at UCLA. Together they adopted a son, Asaad Amin (born 1986), when Asaad was five months old. In 1992, Lonnie incorporated Greatest of All Time, Inc. (G.O.A.T. Inc) to consolidate and license his intellectual properties for commercial purposes. She served as the vice president and treasurer until the sale of the company in 2006.
Ali then lived in Scottsdale, Arizona with Lonnie. In January 2007, it was reported that they had put their home in Berrien Springs, Michigan, which they had bought in 1975, up for sale and had purchased a home in eastern Jefferson County, Kentucky for $1,875,000. Both homes were subsequently sold after Ali&#x27;s death with Lonnie living in their remaining home in Paradise Valley, Arizona. Lonnie converted to Islam from Catholicism in her late twenties.

Ali&#x27;s daughter Laila was a professional boxer from 1999 until 2007, despite her father&#x27;s previous opposition to women&#x27;s boxing. In 1978, he said &quot;Women are not made to be hit in the breast, and face like that.&quot; Ali still attended a number of his daughter&#x27;s fights. Ali&#x27;s daughter Hana is married to Bellator middleweight fighter Kevin Casey. Hana wrote about her father, &quot;His love for people was extraordinary. I would get home from school to find homeless families sleeping in our guest room. He&#x27;d see them on the street, pile them into his Rolls-Royce and bring them home. He&#x27;d buy them clothes, take them to hotels and pay the bills for months in advance.&quot; She also said celebrities like Michael Jackson and Clint Eastwood would often visit Ali.

====Paternity claims====
Kiiursti Mensah-Ali claims she is Ali&#x27;s biological daughter with Barbara Mensah, with whom he allegedly had a 20-year relationship, citing photographs and a paternity test conducted in 1988. She said he accepted responsibility and took care of her, but all contacts with him were cut off after he married his fourth wife Lonnie. Kiiursti says she has a relationship with his other children. After his death she again made passionate appeals to be allowed to mourn at his funeral.

In 2010, Osmon Williams came forward claiming to be Ali&#x27;s biological son. His mother Temica Williams (also known as Rebecca Holloway) launched a $3 million lawsuit against Ali in 1981 for sexual assault, claiming that she had started a sexual relationship with him when she was 12, and that her son Osmon (born 1977) was fathered by Ali when she was 17. She further alleged that Ali had originally supported her and her son financially, but stopped doing so after four years. The case went on until 1986 and was eventually thrown out as her allegations were deemed to be barred by the statute of limitations. According to Veronica, Ali admitted to the affair with Williams, but did not believe Osmon was his son which Veronica supported by saying &quot;Everybody in the camp was going with that girl.&quot; Ali&#x27;s biographer and friend Thomas Hauser has said this claim was of &quot;questionable veracity&quot;.

===Religion and beliefs===
====Affiliation with the Nation of Islam====
Ali said that he first heard of the Nation of Islam when he was fighting in the Golden Gloves tournament in Chicago in 1959 and attended his first Nation of Islam meeting in 1961. He continued to attend meetings, although he kept his involvement hidden from the public. In 1962, Clay met Malcolm X, who soon became his spiritual and political mentor. By the time of the first Liston fight, Nation of Islam members, including Malcolm X, were visible in his entourage. This led to a story in &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; just before the fight disclosing that Clay had joined the Nation of Islam, which nearly caused the bout to be canceled. The article quoted Cassius Clay Sr. as saying that his son had joined the Black Muslims when he was 18.
In fact, Clay was initially refused entry to the Nation of Islam (often called the Black Muslims at the time) due to his boxing career. However, after he won the championship from Liston in 1964, the Nation of Islam was more receptive and agreed to publicize his membership. Shortly afterwards on March 6, Elijah Muhammad gave a radio address that Clay would be renamed Muhammad (one who is worthy of praise) Ali (most high). Around that time Ali moved to the south side of Chicago and lived in a series of houses, always near the Nation of Islam&#x27;s Mosque Maryam or Elijah Muhammad&#x27;s residence. He stayed in Chicago for about 12 years.

Only a few journalists, most notably Howard Cosell, accepted the new name at that time. Ali stated that his earlier name was a &quot;slave name&quot; and a &quot;white man&#x27;s name&quot; and added that &quot;I didn&#x27;t choose it and I don&#x27;t want it. I am Muhammad Ali, a free name&quot;. The person he was formerly named after was a white slave owner turned abolitionist. Ali explained in his autobiography after studying his works, &quot;he may have gotten rid of his slaves, but (he) held on to white supremacy.&quot; Ali concluded: &quot;Why should I keep my white slavemaster&#x27;s name visible and my black ancestors invisible, unknown, unhonored?&quot;

Not afraid to antagonize the white establishment, Ali stated, &quot;I am America. I am the part you won&#x27;t recognize. But get used to me. Black, confident, cocky; my name, not yours; my religion, not yours; my goals, my own; get used to me.&quot; Ali&#x27;s friendship with Malcolm X ended as Malcolm split with the Nation of Islam a couple of weeks after Ali joined, and Ali remained with the Nation of Islam. Ali later said that turning his back on Malcolm was one of the mistakes he regretted most in his life.

Aligning himself with the Nation of Islam, its leader Elijah Muhammad, and a narrative that labeled the white race as the perpetrator of genocide against African Americans made Ali a target of public condemnation. The Nation of Islam was widely viewed by whites and some African Americans as a black separatist &quot;hate religion&quot; with a propensity toward violence; Ali had few qualms about using his influential voice to speak Nation of Islam doctrine. In a press conference articulating his opposition to the Vietnam War, Ali stated, &quot;My enemy is the white people, not Vietcong or Chinese or Japanese.&quot; In relation to integration, he said: &quot;We who follow the teachings of Elijah Muhammad don&#x27;t want to be forced to integrate. Integration is wrong. We don&#x27;t want to live with the white man; that&#x27;s all.&quot;

Writer Jerry Izenberg once noted that, &quot;the Nation became Ali&#x27;s family and Elijah Muhammad became his father. But there is an irony to the fact that while the Nation branded white people as devils, Ali had more white colleagues than most African American people did at that time in America, and continued to have them throughout his career.&quot;

====Conversion to Sunni Islam====
In Hauser&#x27;s biography &quot;Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times&quot;, Ali stated that he was not a Christian as he thought the idea of God having a son sounded wrong and did not make sense to him, stating, &quot;God don&#x27;t beget; man begets&quot;. However, he still believed that even good Christians or good Jews could receive God&#x27;s blessing and enter heaven as he stated, &quot;God created all people, no matter what their religion&quot;. He also stated, &quot;If you&#x27;re against someone because he&#x27;s a Muslim that&#x27;s wrong. If you&#x27;re against someone because he&#x27;s a Christian or a Jew, that&#x27;s wrong&quot;.

In a 2004 autobiography, Ali attributed his conversion to mainstream Sunni Islam to Warith Deen Muhammad, who assumed leadership of the Nation of Islam upon the death of his father Elijah Muhammad and persuaded the Nation&#x27;s followers to become adherents of Sunni Islam. He said some people did not like the change and stuck to Elijah&#x27;s teachings, but he admired it, and so left Elijah&#x27;s teachings and became a follower of Sunni Islam.

Ali had gone on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in 1972, which inspired him in a similar manner to Malcolm X, meeting people of different colors from all over the world giving him a different outlook and greater spiritual awareness. In 1977, he said that, after he retired, he would dedicate the rest of his life to getting &quot;ready to meet God&quot; by helping people, charitable causes, uniting people and helping to make peace. He went on another Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca in 1988.

After the September 11 attacks in 2001, he stated that &quot;Islam is a religion of peace&quot; and &quot;does not promote terrorism or killing people&quot;, and that he was &quot;angry that the world sees a certain group of Islam followers who caused this destruction, but they are not real Muslims. They are racist fanatics who call themselves Muslims.&quot; In December 2015, after the November 2015 Paris attacks, he stated that &quot;True Muslims know that the ruthless violence of so-called Islamic jihadists goes against the very tenets of our religion&quot;, that &quot;We as Muslims have to stand up to those who use Islam to advance their own personal agenda&quot;, and that &quot;political leaders should use their position to bring understanding about the religion of Islam, and clarify that these misguided murderers have perverted people&#x27;s views on what Islam really is.&quot;

He also developed an interest in Sufism, which he referenced in his autobiography, &quot;The Soul of a Butterfly&quot;. According to Ali&#x27;s daughter, Hana Yasmeen Ali, who co-authored &quot;The Soul of a Butterfly&quot; with him, Ali was attracted to Sufism after reading the books of Inayat Khan, which contain Sufi teachings.

Muhammad Ali received guidance from Islamic scholars such as Grand Mufti of Syria Al Marhum Al Sheikh Ahmed Kuftaro, Hisham Kabbani, Imam Zaid Shakir, Hamza Yusuf, and Timothy J. Gianotti, who planned his funeral.

===Health===
During his amateur career, Ali refrained from smoking, drugs, and drinking alcohol and soda pop, and adopted an idiosyncratic diet. Upon his acceptance of the dietary restrictions of Islam, the Nation of Islam recruited cooks to prepare his meals.

==Entertainment career==

===Acting===
Ali had a cameo role in the 1962 film version of &quot;Requiem for a Heavyweight&quot;, and during his exile from boxing, he starred in the short-lived 1969 Broadway musical, &quot;Buck White&quot;. He also appeared in the documentary film &quot;Black Rodeo&quot; (1972) riding both a horse and a bull.

His autobiography &quot;The Greatest: My Own Story&quot;, written with Richard Durham, was published in 1975. In 1977 the book was adapted into a film called &quot;The Greatest&quot;, in which Ali played himself and Ernest Borgnine played Angelo Dundee.

The film &quot;Freedom Road&quot;, made in 1978, features Ali in a rare acting role as Gideon Jackson, a former slave and Union (American Civil War) soldier in 1870s Virginia, who gets elected to the U.S. Senate and battles alongside former slaves and white sharecroppers to keep the land they have tended all their lives.

===Spoken word poetry===
In 1963, Ali released an album of spoken word music on Columbia Records titled, &quot;I Am the Greatest&quot;, and in 1964, he recorded a cover version of the rhythm and blues song &quot;Stand by Me&quot;. &quot;I Am the Greatest&quot; sold 500,000 copies, and has been identified as an early example of rap music and a precursor to hip hop. It reached number 61 on the album chart and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album at the 6th Annual Grammy Awards in 1964. He later received a second Grammy nomination, for &quot;Best Recording for Children&quot;, with his 1976 spoken word novelty record, &quot;The Adventures of Ali and His Gang vs. Mr. Tooth Decay&quot;.

===Professional wrestling===
Ali was involved with professional wrestling at different times in his career.

On June 1, 1976, as Ali was preparing for his bout with Inoki, he attended a match featuring Gorilla Monsoon. After the match was over, Ali removed his shirt and jacket and confronted professional wrestler Gorilla Monsoon in the ring after his match at a World Wide Wrestling Federation show in Philadelphia Arena. After dodging a few punches, Monsoon put Ali in an airplane spin and dumped him to the mat. Ali stumbled to the corner, where his associate Butch Lewis convinced him to walk away.
On March 31, 1985, Ali was the special guest referee for the main event of the inaugural WrestleMania event.

In 1995, Ali led a group of Japanese and American professional wrestlers, including his 1976 opponent Antonio Inoki and Ric Flair, on a sports diplomacy mission to North Korea. Ali was guest of honor at the record-breaking Collision in Korea, a wrestling event with the largest attendance of all time.

Ali was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame by The Undertaker at the 2024 ceremony.

===Television appearances===
Muhammad Ali&#x27;s fights were some of the world&#x27;s most-watched television broadcasts, setting television viewership records. His most-watched fights drew an estimated 12 billion viewers worldwide between 1974 and 1980, and were the world&#x27;s most-watched live television broadcasts at the time. Outside of fights, he made many other television appearances. The following table lists known viewership figures of his non-fight television appearances. For television viewership figures of his fights, see &quot;Boxing career of Muhammad Ali: Television viewership&quot;.

=== Art ===
Ali was also an amateur artist and made dozens of drawings and paintings in the 1970s. In 1977, Rodney Hilton Brown, who owned an art gallery in NYC, asked Ali if he was interested in painting. Ali took him up on the offer and produced several paintings for him to sell. Brown is the author of &quot;Muhammad Ali: The Untold Story: Painter, Poet and Prophet&quot;. In October 2021, 26 of his drawings and arts were placed on auction and sold for close to US$1 Million.

==Later life==
By the end of his boxing career Ali had absorbed an estimated 200,000 hits.

In 1984, Ali was diagnosed with Parkinson&#x27;s syndrome, which sometimes results from head trauma from violent physical activities such as boxing. Ali still remained active during this time, later participating as a guest referee at WrestleMania I.

===Philanthropy, humanitarianism and politics===

Ali was known for being a humanitarian and philanthropist. He focused on practicing his Islamic duty of charity and good deeds, donating millions to charity organizations and disadvantaged people of all religious backgrounds. It is estimated that Ali helped to feed more than 22million people afflicted by hunger across the world. Early in his career, one of his main focuses was youth education. He spoke at several historically black colleges and universities about the importance of education and became the largest single black donor to the United Negro College Fund in 1967 by way of a $10,000 donation ($78,000 in 2020 USD). In late 1966, he also pledged to donate a total of $100,000 to the UNCF (specifically promising to donate much of the proceeds of his title defense against Cleveland Williams) and paid $4,500 per closed circuit installation at six HBCUs so they could watch his fights.

Ali began visiting Africa, starting in 1964 when he visited Nigeria and Ghana. In 1974, he visited a Palestinian refugee camp in Southern Lebanon, where Ali declared &quot;support for the Palestinian struggle to liberate their homeland&quot;. During that visit Ali also declared that the &quot;United States is the stronghold of Zionism and imperialism.&quot; In 1978, following his loss to Spinks and before winning the rematch, Ali visited Bangladesh and received honorary citizenship there. The same year, he participated in The Longest Walk, a protest march in the United States in support of Native American rights, along with singer Stevie Wonder and actor Marlon Brando.

In early 1980, Ali was recruited by President Jimmy Carter for a diplomatic mission to Africa, in an effort to persuade a number of African governments to join the US-led boycott of the Moscow Olympics in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Having arrived in Tanzania, Ali told cameras, &quot;Russia is invading a Muslim country, Asiatic country,&quot; and that its probable intention to head to oil-rich Persia to take wells and ports &quot;could lead to nuclear war. My purpose in coming here was to try to stop that.&quot; However, according to Ali biographer Thomas Hauser, &quot;at best, it was ill-conceived; at worst, a diplomatic disaster.&quot; The Tanzanian government was insulted that Carter had sent an athlete to discuss a serious political issue. One official asked whether the United States would &quot;send Chris Evert to negotiate with London&quot;. Consequently, Ali was only received by the youth and culture minister, rather than President Julius Nyerere. Ali was unable to explain why the African countries should join the US boycott when it had failed to support the African boycott of the 1976 Olympics (in protest of Apartheid in South Africa), although neither did the Soviet Union, and was unaware of the sentiment that the Soviet Union had backed some popular revolutions on the continent, although none of the countries on the itinerary were Soviet allies. The Nigerian government also rebuffed him and confirmed that they would be participating in the Moscow Games. Ali did, however, convince the government of Kenya to boycott the Soviet Olympics.

On January 19, 1981, in Los Angeles, Ali talked a suicidal man down from jumping off a ninth-floor ledge, an event that made national news.
In 1984, Ali announced his support for the re-election of United States President Ronald Reagan. When asked to elaborate on his endorsement of Reagan, Ali told reporters, &quot;He&#x27;s keeping God in schools and that&#x27;s enough.&quot; In 1985, he visited Israel to request the release of Muslim prisoners at Atlit detainee camp, which Israel declined.

Around 1987, the California Bicentennial Foundation for the U.S. Constitution selected Ali to personify the vitality of the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights. Ali rode on a float at the following year&#x27;s Tournament of Roses Parade, launching the U.S. Constitution&#x27;s 200th birthday commemoration. In 1988, during the First Intifada, Ali participated in a Chicago rally in support of Palestine. The same year, he visited Sudan to raise awareness about the plight of famine victims. According to &quot;Politico&quot;, Ali supported Orrin Hatch politically. In 1989, he participated in an Indian charity event with the Muslim Educational Society in Kozhikode, Kerala, along with Bollywood actor Dilip Kumar. 
In 1990, Ali traveled to Iraq prior to the Gulf War and met with president Saddam Hussein in an attempt to negotiate the release of American hostages. Ali secured the release of the hostages, in exchange for promising Hussein that he would bring America &quot;an honest account&quot; of Iraq. Despite arranging the hostages&#x27; release, he received criticism from president George H. W. Bush, and Joseph C. Wilson, the highest-ranking American diplomat in Baghdad.

In 1994, Ali campaigned to the United States government to come to the aid of refugees afflicted by the Rwandan genocide, and to donate to organizations helping Rwandan refugees.

In 1996, he lit the flame at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. It was watched by an estimated 3.5billion viewers worldwide.

After Ali met a lesbian couple who were fans of his in 1997, he smiled and said to friend and biographer Thomas Hauser, &quot;They look like they&#x27;re happy together.&quot; Hauser wrote about the story, &quot;The thought that Liz and Roz (the lesbian couple he met) were happy pleased Muhammad. Ali wanted people to be happy.&quot;

On November 17, 2002, Ali went to Afghanistan as the &quot;U.N. Messenger of Peace&quot;. He was in Kabul for a three-day goodwill mission as a special guest of the UN.

On September 1, 2009, Ali visited Ennis, County Clare, Ireland, the home of his great-grandfather, Abe Grady, who emigrated to the U.S. in the 1860s, eventually settling in Kentucky.

On July 27, 2012, Ali was a titular bearer of the Olympic flag during the opening ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. He was helped to his feet by his wife Lonnie to stand before the flag due to his Parkinson&#x27;s syndrome rendering him unable to carry it into the stadium. The same year, he was awarded the Philadelphia Liberty Medal in recognition of his lifelong efforts in activism, philanthropy and humanitarianism.

=== Earnings ===
By 1978, Ali&#x27;s total fight purse earnings were estimated to be nearly $60million (inflation-adjusted ), including an estimated $47.45million grossed between 1970 and 1978. By 1980, his total fight purse earnings were estimated to be up to $70million (inflation-adjusted $million).

In 1978, Ali revealed that he was &quot;broke&quot; and several news outlets reported his net worth to be an estimated (inflation-adjusted $million). The press attributed his decline in wealth to several factors, including taxes consuming at least half of his income, management taking a third of his income, his lifestyle, and spending on family, charity and religious causes.

In 2006, Ali sold his name and image for $50million, after which &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated his net worth to be $55million in 2006. Following his death in 2016, his fortune was estimated to be between $50million and $80million.

===Declining health===

Ali&#x27;s Parkinson&#x27;s syndrome led to a gradual decline in his health, though he was still active into the early 2000s, promoting his own biopic, &quot;Ali&quot;, in 2001. That year he also contributed an on-camera segment to the &quot;&quot; benefit concert.

In 1998, Ali began working with actor Michael J. Fox, who has Parkinson&#x27;s disease, to raise awareness and fund research for a cure. They made a joint appearance before Congress to push the case in 2002. In 2000, Ali worked with the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson&#x27;s Research to raise awareness and encourage donations for research.

In February 2013, Ali&#x27;s brother Rahaman Ali said Muhammad could no longer speak and could be dead within days. Ali&#x27;s daughter May May Ali responded to the rumors, stating that she had talked to him on the phone the morning of February 3 and he was fine. On December 20, 2014, Ali was hospitalized for a mild case of pneumonia. Ali was once again hospitalized on January 15, 2015, for a urinary tract infection after being found unresponsive at a guest house in Scottsdale, Arizona. He was released the next day.

==Death==
Ali was hospitalized in Scottsdale, Arizona, on June 2, 2016, with a respiratory illness. Though his condition was initially described as fair, it worsened, and he died the following day at the age of 74 from septic shock.

===News coverage and tributes===
Following Ali&#x27;s death, he was the number-one trending topic on Twitter for over 12 hours and on Facebook for several days. BET played their documentary &quot;Muhammad Ali: Made In Miami&quot;. ESPN played four hours of non-stop commercial-free coverage of Ali. News networks, such as ABC News, BBC, CNN, and Fox News, also covered him extensively.

He was mourned globally, and a family spokesman said the family &quot;certainly believes that Muhammad was a citizen of the world ... and they know that the world grieves with him&quot;. Politicians such as Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, David Cameron and more paid tribute to Ali. Ali also received numerous tributes from the world of sports including Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Floyd Mayweather, Mike Tyson, the Miami Marlins, LeBron James, Steph Curry and more. Then-Louisville mayor Greg Fischer stated, &quot;Muhammad Ali belongs to the world. But he only has one hometown.&quot;

The day after Ali&#x27;s death, the UFC paid tribute to Ali at their UFC 199 event in a lengthy video tribute package, crediting Ali for his accomplishments and inspiring multiple UFC champions.

===Memorial===
Ali&#x27;s funeral had been pre-planned by himself and others for several years prior to his actual death. The services began in Louisville on June 9, 2016, with an Islamic Janazah prayer service at Freedom Hall on the grounds of the Kentucky Exposition Center. The Janazah prayer was attended by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. On June 10, 2016, the funeral procession passed through the streets of Louisville ending at Cave Hill Cemetery, where his body was interred during a private ceremony. A public memorial service for Ali at downtown Louisville&#x27;s KFC Yum! Center was held during the afternoon of June 10. Billy Crystal, his wife Lonnie Ali, sports journalist Bryant Gumbel and former President Bill Clinton all gave the eulogies. The pallbearers included Will Smith, Lennox Lewis and Mike Tyson, with honorary pallbearers including George Chuvalo, Larry Holmes and George Foreman. Ali&#x27;s memorial was watched by an estimated 1billion viewers worldwide.

==Legacy==
===In boxing===
Ali remains the only three-time lineal heavyweight champion. He is the only boxer to be named &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine Fighter of the Year six times and was involved in more &quot;Ring&quot; &quot;Fight of the Year&quot; bouts than any other fighter. He was one of only three boxers to be named &quot;Sportsman of the Year&quot; by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. He was also named BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year three times.

Ali was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in its first year and held wins over seven other Hall of Fame inductees during an era that has been called the golden age of heavyweight boxing. His joint records of beating 21 boxers for the world heavyweight title and winning 14 unified title bouts stood for 35 years.

===In hip-hop===
Ali often used rhyme schemes and spoken word poetry when trash talking in boxing, and also delivered political poetry in his activism outside of boxing. He played a role in the shaping of the black poetic tradition, paving the way for The Last Poets in 1968, Gil Scott-Heron in 1970, and the emergence of rap music in the 1970s. Ali has been referred to as &quot;the first rapper&quot;. As a &quot;rhyming trickster&quot;, he was noted for his boasts, &quot;funky delivery&quot;, &quot;comical trash talk&quot;, and &quot;endless quotables&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; notes his &quot;freestyle skills&quot; and his &quot;rhymes, flow, and braggadocio&quot; would &quot;one day become typical of old school MCs like Run DMC and LL Cool J&quot;, and his &quot;outsized ego foreshadowed the vainglorious excesses of Kanye West, while his Afrocentric consciousness and cutting honesty pointed forward to modern bards like Rakim, Nas, Jay-Z, and Kendrick Lamar.&quot;

In 2006, the documentary &quot;Ali Rap&quot; was produced by ESPN, with Chuck D of Public Enemy as the host. Other rappers narrated the documentary as well, including Doug E Fresh, Ludacris and Rakim who all spoke on Ali&#x27;s behalf in the film.

Ali has been cited as an inspiration by many celebrated rappers, throughout the following decades, such as LL Cool J, Chuck D, Jay-Z, Eminem, Sean Combs, Slick Rick, Nas and MC Lyte, and is frequently mentioned in popular hip-hop songs.

===In Ali&#x27;s hometown===
In 1978, shortly after becoming heavyweight champion of the world for the third time, and three years before his permanent retirement, Ali received a round of accolades in his hometown of Louisville. In September, at a tribute ceremony held at Fairgrounds Stadium, then-Governor of Kentucky Julian Carroll proclaimed 1978 the &quot;Year of Ali&quot; and presented to Ali the Governor&#x27;s Distinguished Service Award. Carroll said he signed the proclamation because &quot;no single day or week – or even month – ever could contain the deeds of this man.&quot; In November, the Louisville Board of Aldermen voted 6–5 to rename downtown thoroughfare Walnut Street to Muhammad Ali Boulevard, via an ordinance shortly signed into law by then-Mayor William B. Stansbury. This was controversial at the time, as within a week 12 of the 70 street signs were stolen.
As the street renaming was under consideration, a committee of the Jefferson County Public Schools (Kentucky) considered renaming Ali&#x27;s alma mater, Central High School, in his honor. Despite an initial endorsement by then-Jefferson County Judge/Executive and current U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, and an affirmative vote by the Jefferson County Fiscal Court, the committee decided not to proceed, citing long-time school tradition and alumni disagreement, even though they urged other ways to honor Ali in the community. In time, Muhammad Ali Boulevard—and Ali himself—came to be well accepted in his hometown.

In November 2005, Ali and his wife Lonnie Ali opened the $54million, 93,000ft2, non-profit Muhammad Ali Center in downtown Louisville. In addition to displaying his boxing memorabilia, the center focuses on core themes of peace, social responsibility, respect, and personal growth.

On January 16, 2019, the Louisville Regional Airport Authority voted to change the name of the city&#x27;s main airport to &quot;Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport&quot; in honor of Ali. Then-Louisville mayor Greg Fischer upon the occasion said: On June 6, 2019, the airport unveiled its new logo, featuring &quot;Ali&#x27;s silhouette, arms up and victorious, against the background of a butterfly.&quot;

===Around the US and world===
Martial artist and actor Bruce Lee was influenced by Ali, whose footwork he studied and incorporated into his own style while developing Jeet Kune Do in the 1960s.

Opened in 1976, Ali Mall, located in Araneta Center, Quezon City, Philippines, is named after Ali. Construction of the mall, the first of its kind in the Philippines, began shortly after his victory in a match with Joe Frazier in nearby Araneta Coliseum in 1975. Ali attended its opening. The Muhammad Ali vs. Antonio Inoki fight the same year played an important role in the history of mixed martial arts. In Japan, the match inspired Inoki&#x27;s students Masakatsu Funaki and Minoru Suzuki to found Pancrase in 1993, which in turn inspired the foundation of Pride Fighting Championships in 1997. Pride was acquired by its rival, Ultimate Fighting Championship, in 2007.
Ali was the recipient of the 1997 Arthur Ashe Courage Award. He was presented with the Presidential Citizens Medal by President Bill Clinton in January 2001 and with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush in November 2005. For his work with the civil rights movement and the United Nations, he received the Otto Hahn Peace Medal in Gold from the UN Association of Germany (DGVN) in Berlin in December 2005.

The Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform Act was introduced in 1999 and passed in 2000, to protect the rights and welfare of boxers in the United States. In May 2016, a bill was introduced to United States Congress by Markwayne Mullin, a politician and former MMA fighter, to extend the Ali Act to mixed martial arts. In June 2016, US senator Rand Paul proposed an amendment to the US draft laws named after Ali, a proposal to eliminate the Selective Service System.

In June 2007, Ali received an honorary doctorate of humanities at Princeton University&#x27;s 260th graduation ceremony.

In 2015, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; renamed its Sportsman Legacy Award to the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Muhammad Ali Legacy Award. The annual award was originally created in 2008 and honors former &quot;sports figures who embody the ideals of sportsmanship, leadership and philanthropy as vehicles for changing the world&quot;. Ali first appeared on the magazine&#x27;s cover in 1963 and went on to be featured on numerous covers during his storied career.

The Society of Voice Arts and Sciences created the Muhammad Ali Voice of Humanity Honor in 2016, which is presented at its annual Voice Arts Awards. The award was created in collaboration with the Muhammad Ali Center and is presented to &quot;an individual whose voice, through humanitarianism, activism or personal sacrifice, has made a decidedly positive impact on our national or global condition as a society&quot;. Sculptor Marc Mellon created the bronze sculpture for the award, which depicts Ali mid-speech. Recipients of the honor include Dr. Henry Louis Gates, Ken Burns, Vance Jones, Lonnie Ali, Stacey Abrams, Wes Studi, and Manuela Testolini.

In January 2017, the Muhammad Ali Commemorative Coin Act was introduced into the 115th Congress but was not enacted.

===20th-century superlatives===
By the end of the 20th century, Ali had made it onto several superlatives lists or otherwise was mentioned in superlative terms covering the century or a large portion thereof.

Ali was ranked at or near the top of most lists of the 20th century&#x27;s greatest boxers. He was crowned Sportsman of the Century by &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. Named BBC&#x27;s Sports Personality of the Century, he received more votes than the other five candidates combined. The Associated Press ranked him as the second best boxer and best heavyweight of the 20th century. He was named Athlete of the Century by &quot;USA Today&quot;, and ranked as the third greatest North American athlete of the 20th century by ESPN &quot;SportsCentury&quot;. Ali was named &quot;Kentucky Athlete of the Century&quot; by the Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame in ceremonies at the Galt House East.

Ali was named one of the 100 most influential Americans of the 20th century by Life magazine in 1990. In 1993, the Associated Press reported that Ali was tied with Babe Ruth as the most recognized athlete, out of over 800 dead or living athletes, in America. The study found that over 97% of Americans over 12 years of age identified both Ali and Ruth. In 1999, he was one of three athletes, alongside Pelé and Jackie Robinson, named in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 Most Important People of the 20th Century.

==In media and popular culture==
As a world champion boxer, social activist, heartthrob and pop culture icon, Ali was the subject of numerous creative works including books, films, music, video games, TV shows, and other. Muhammad Ali was often dubbed the world&#x27;s &quot;most famous&quot; person in the media. Several of his fights were watched by an estimated 12 billion viewers between 1974 and 1980, and his lighting of the torch at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics was watched by an estimated 3.5billion viewers.
Ali appeared on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; on 38 different occasions, second only to Michael Jordan&#x27;s 50. He also appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine 5 times. In 2015, Harris Poll found that Ali was one of the three most recognizable athletes in the United States, along with Michael Jordan and Babe Ruth.

On the set of &quot;Freedom Road&quot; Ali met Canadian singer-songwriter Michel, and subsequently helped create Michel&#x27;s album &quot;The First Flight of the Gizzelda Dragon&quot; and an unaired television special featuring them both.
Ali was the subject of the British television program &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1978 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews. Ali was featured in &quot;Superman vs. Muhammad Ali&quot;, a 1978 DC Comics comic book pitting the champ against the superhero. In 1979, Ali guest starred as himself in an episode of the NBC sitcom &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot;. The show&#x27;s title itself was inspired by the quote &quot;Different strokes for different folks&quot; popularized in 1966 by Ali, who also inspired the title of the 1967 Syl Johnson song &quot;Different Strokes&quot;, one of the most sampled songs in pop music history.

He also wrote several bestselling books about his career, including &quot;The Greatest: My Own Story&quot; and &quot;The Soul of a Butterfly&quot;. The Muhammad Ali effect, named after Ali, is a term that came into use in psychology in the 1980s, as he stated in &quot;The Greatest: My Own Story&quot;: &quot;I only said I was the greatest, not the smartest.&quot; According to this effect, when people are asked to rate their intelligence and moral behavior in comparison to others, people will rate themselves as more moral, but not more intelligent than others. Ali cooperated with Thomas Hauser on a biography, &quot;Muhammad Ali: His Life and Times&quot;. The oral history was released in 1991.

&quot;When We Were Kings&quot;, a 1996 documentary about the &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot;, won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. The 2001 biopic &quot;Ali&quot; garnered a Best Actor Oscar nomination for Will Smith for his portrayal of Ali. Prior to making the film, Smith rejected the role until Ali requested that he accept it. Smith said the first thing Ali told him was: &quot;Man, you&#x27;re almost pretty enough to play me.&quot;

In 2002, Ali was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his contributions to the entertainment industry. His star is the only one to be mounted on a vertical surface, out of deference to his request that the name Muhammad—a name he shares with the Islamic prophet—not be walked upon.

His 1966 fight against George Chuvalo was the subject of the 2003 documentary film &quot;The Last Round: Chuvalo vs. Ali&quot;. A decade later, &quot;The Trials of Muhammad Ali&quot;, a documentary directed by Bill Siegel that focuses on Ali&#x27;s refusal of the draft during the Vietnam War, opened in Manhattan in August 2013. A 2013 made-for-TV movie titled &quot;Muhammad Ali&#x27;s Greatest Fight&quot; dramatized the same aspect of Ali&#x27;s life.

Antoine Fuqua&#x27;s documentary &quot;What&#x27;s My Name: Muhammad Ali&quot; was released in 2019. Then in September 2021, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns released the four-part docuseries &quot;Muhammad Ali&quot;, spanning over eight hours on Ali&#x27;s life. The series, which Burns began developing in early 2016, was broadcast on PBS. Dave Zirin, who watched an 8-hour rough cut of this documentary, called it &quot;utterly outstanding&quot; and said &quot;the footage they found will blow minds&quot;.

In spring 2025, the officially authorized musical &quot;Ali&quot;, based on Ali&#x27;s life, will be debuting. Originally expected to debut at The Kentucky Center in Ali&#x27;s hometown of Louisville, it will instead have its premiere at the Nederlander Theatre in Chicago, before later moving on to Broadway. The musical is being directed and written by Clint Dyer, deputy artistic director of London&#x27;s National Theatre, and scored by Louisville Orchestra&#x27;s music director and conductor Teddy Abrams. Rapper and record producer Q-Tip has joined the production as music director and co-lyricist, along with Rich + Tone Talauega as choreographers.

<doc id="63750" wikidata="Q332388" url="?curid=63750" title="The Two Towers">
<text>The Two Towers, first published in 1954, is the second volume of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s high fantasy novel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. It is preceded by &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and followed by &quot;The Return of the King&quot;. The volume&#x27;s title is ambiguous, as five towers are named in the narrative, and Tolkien himself gave conflicting identifications of the two towers. The narrative is interlaced, allowing Tolkien to build in suspense and surprise. The volume was largely welcomed by critics, who found it exciting and compelling, combining epic narrative with heroic romance. It formed the basis for the 2002 film &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot;, directed by Peter Jackson.

== Publication ==

&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is composed of six &quot;books&quot;, aside from an introduction, a prologue and six appendices. However, the novel was originally published as three separate volumes, to reduce the cost of publication. &quot;The Two Towers&quot; covers Books Three and Four.

==Contents==

Some editions of the volume contain a Synopsis for readers who have not read the earlier volume. The body of the volume consists of Book Three: The Treason of Isengard, and Book Four: The Ring Goes East.

=== Book III: The Treason of Isengard ===

A party of large Orcs, Uruk-hai, sent by Saruman, and other Orcs sent by Sauron and led by Grishnákh, attack the Fellowship. Boromir tries to protect Merry and Pippin from the Orcs, but they kill him and capture the two hobbits. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas decide to pursue the Orcs taking Merry and Pippin to Saruman. In the kingdom of Rohan, the Orcs are killed by Riders of Rohan, led by Éomer. Merry and Pippin escape into Fangorn Forest, where they are befriended by Treebeard, the oldest of the tree-like Ents. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas track the hobbits to Fangorn. There they unexpectedly meet Gandalf, resurrected from the dead.

Gandalf explains that he killed the Balrog. He was also killed in the fight, but was sent back to Middle-earth to complete his mission. He is clothed in white and is now Gandalf the White, for he has taken Saruman&#x27;s place as the chief of the wizards. Gandalf assures his friends that Merry and Pippin are safe. Together they ride to Edoras, capital of Rohan. Gandalf frees Théoden, King of Rohan, from the influence of Saruman&#x27;s spy Gríma Wormtongue. Théoden musters his fighting strength and rides with his men to the ancient fortress of Helm&#x27;s Deep, while Gandalf departs to seek help from Treebeard.

Meanwhile, the Ents, roused by Merry and Pippin from their peaceful ways, attack and destroy Isengard, Saruman&#x27;s stronghold, and flood it, trapping the wizard in the tower of Orthanc. Gandalf convinces Treebeard to send an army of Huorns to Théoden&#x27;s aid. He brings an army of Rohirrim to Helm&#x27;s Deep, and they defeat the Orcs, who flee into the forest of Huorns, never to be seen again. Gandalf, Théoden, Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli ride to Isengard, and are surprised to find Merry and Pippin relaxing amidst the ruins. Gandalf offers Saruman a chance to turn away from evil. When Saruman refuses to listen, Gandalf strips him of his rank and most of his powers. After Saruman leaves, Wormtongue throws down a hard round object to try to kill Gandalf. It misses and Pippin picks it up; Gandalf swiftly takes it, but Pippin steals it in the night. It is revealed to be a &quot;palantír&quot;, a seeing-stone that Saruman used to speak with Sauron, and that Sauron used to ensnare him. Pippin begins to be entranced by its power. While Gandalf sleeps, Pippin examines the &quot;palantír&quot;, inadvertently causing Sauron to see him; as Pippin is a hobbit, Sauron believes Pippin has the One Ring. Gandalf is awoken by the commotion and is able to save the incapacitated Pippin. Gandalf immediately rides for Minas Tirith, the chief city of Gondor, taking Pippin with him.

=== Book IV: The Ring Goes East ===

Frodo and Sam, heading for Mordor to destroy the One Ring, struggle through the barren hills and cliffs of the Emyn Muil. They become aware they are being watched and tracked; on a moonlit night they capture Gollum, who has followed them from Moria. Frodo makes Gollum swear to serve him, as Ringbearer, and asks him to guide them to Mordor. Gollum leads them across the Dead Marshes. Sam overhears Gollum debating with his alter ego, Sméagol, whether to break his promise and steal the Ring.

They find that the Black Gate of Mordor is too well guarded to pass through, so instead they travel south through the land of Ithilien to a secret pass that Gollum knows. On the way, they are captured by rangers led by Faramir, Boromir&#x27;s younger brother, and brought to the secret fastness of Henneth Annûn. Unlike his brother, Faramir resists the temptation to seize the Ring and, disobeying standing orders to arrest strangers found in Ithilien, releases them.

Gollum – who is torn between his loyalty to Frodo and his desire for the Ring – guides the hobbits to the pass of Cirith Ungol, but leads them into the lair of the great spider Shelob in the tunnels there. Frodo holds up the gift given to him in Lothlórien: the Phial of Galadriel, which holds the light of Eärendil&#x27;s star. The light drives Shelob away, and Frodo and Sam are able to get through the pass safely. However, after they leave the pass, Shelob appears and attacks Frodo; before he can help his master, Sam is attacked by Gollum. After fighting off Gollum, Sam picks up Frodo&#x27;s sword, Sting; and the Phial. He seriously wounds and drives off Shelob, but after the fight, he finds Frodo unresponsive. Believing him to be dead, Sam takes the Ring to continue the quest alone. Before Sam gets far, however, Orcs find Frodo; Sam overhears them and learns that Frodo is still alive.

== Meaning of title ==

In a letter to Rayner Unwin in August 1953, Tolkien proposed the volume&#x27;s title and considered leaving it vague, naming the ambiguous two as Orthanc and Barad-dûr, or Minas Tirith and Barad-dûr, or Orthanc and the Tower of Cirith Ungol. In another letter, in January 1954, he stated that he was &quot;not at all happy about the title &quot;The Two Towers&quot;&quot;, writing that if the title had &quot;any real reference in it to Vol II&quot; it would have to &quot;refer to &quot;Orthanc&quot; and the &quot;Tower of Cirith Ungol&quot; (his italics). He at once added that this would however be &quot;very misleading&quot;, since there was &quot;so much made of the basic opposition of the Dark Tower and Minas Tirith&quot;. However, a month later, he wrote a note that is included at the end of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, and later drew a cover illustration, both of which identified the pair as Minas Morgul and Orthanc. In the illustration, Minas Morgul is a white tower, with a thin waning moon above it, in reference to its original name, Minas Ithil, the Tower of the Rising Moon. Orthanc is shown as a black tower, three-horned, with Saruman&#x27;s sign of the White Hand beside it. A Nazgûl flies between the two towers.

== Interwoven narratives ==

The narrative in the volume is interlaced, unlike the largely linear narrative in &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, as the Fellowship is broken and the different groups pursue their own quests. The main quest, to destroy the One Ring, does not progress at all in book 3; conversely, the other quests do not make progress in book 4 as Frodo and Sam continue their dangerous journey towards Mordor. The timeline is more complex than this would suggest, as many smaller-scale interlacings occur as the characters travel through Middle-earth.

Interlacing allowed Tolkien to weave an elaborately intricate story, presented through the eyes of the Hobbit protagonists, &quot;underscoring [their] frequent bewilderment and disorientation&quot;. Most directly, this is achieved by letting the reader know only what one character sees as he struggles forwards, not knowing what lies ahead, where his friends are, or whether the quest has already failed. The bewilderment of the reader is minimized by the use of synchronizing &#x27;narrative landmarks&#x27;, such as the brooch dropped by Pippin and discovered by Aragorn. Equally, interlacing enables Tolkien to create suspense and &quot;cliffhanger&quot; section endings, as when the Ents and Huorns appear suddenly and decisively in the eucatastrophe on the battlefield of Helm&#x27;s Deep.

The Tolkien scholar Richard C. West writes that every reader must notice to some degree &quot;the apparently meandering manner of the plot&quot;, where things happen apparently casually, as if by chance, as in real life. West illustrates this by examining Merry and Pippin&#x27;s meeting with the Ents. This causes the Ents to overthrow their enemy Saruman, who was also the enemy of the kingdom of Rohan. This frees up Rohan to go to the aid of Gondor in their war with Sauron. The two Hobbits would never have met the Ents unless Saruman&#x27;s Orcs had captured them. The Hobbits would not have escaped the Orcs unless Éomer&#x27;s band of Riders of Rohan, disobeying orders from the King, had hunted the Orc intruders down. West states that each group and character has their own motivation, but their stories interact. It feels natural, and may appear &quot;loose&quot;, but &quot;everything is interconnected.&quot; The interlacing allows Tolkien to make hidden connections that can only be grasped retrospectively, as the reader realizes on reflection that certain events happened at the same time. Interlace, West notes, can &quot;show purpose or pattern behind change&quot;. This can appear, Shippey writes, as luck, where in daily life it is uncertain whether this is &quot;something completely humdrum and practical or something mysterious and supernatural&quot;.

== Reception ==

Donald Barr in &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the book a positive review, calling it &quot;an extraordinary work – pure excitement, unencumbered narrative, moral warmth, barefaced rejoicing in beauty, but excitement most of all&quot;.

Anthony Boucher, reviewing the volume in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, wrote that &quot;The Two Towers&quot; &quot;makes inordinate demands upon the patience of its readers&quot; with passages which &quot;could be lopped away without affecting form or content&quot;. Nevertheless, he lavished praise on the volume, saying &quot;no writer save E. R. Eddison has ever so satisfactorily and compellingly created his own mythology and made it come vividly alive ... described in some of the most sheerly beautiful prose that this harsh decade has seen in print.&quot;

&quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; called it a &quot;prose epic in praise of courage&quot; and stated that Tolkien&#x27;s Westernesse &quot;comes to rank in the reader&#x27;s imagination with Asgard and Camelot&quot;.

John Jordan, admiring the book&#x27;s narrative in the &quot;Irish Press&quot;, wrote of its &quot;weaving of epic, heroic romance, parable, and fairy tale, and the more adventurous kind of detective story, into a pattern at once strange and curiously familiar to our experience&quot;. He compared the wizard Gandalf&#x27;s death and reappearance to Christ&#x27;s resurrection, writing that this could be done &quot;without irreverence&quot; because of Tolkien&#x27;s seriousness about good and evil.

Mahmud Manzalaoui, in the &quot;Egyptian Gazette&quot;, wrote that the book &quot;has not pleased readers of the staple modern psychological novel&quot;, but that it signified a new trend in fiction.

In &quot;The Observer&quot;, the Scottish poet Edwin Muir, who had praised &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, called Tolkien&#x27;s invention of the Ents and his account of the Battle of Helm&#x27;s Deep magnificent. He wrote that contrary to some people&#x27;s assumption, one could not equate the Ring to the atomic bomb; rather, it directly represented evil.

== Adaptations ==

Peter Jackson&#x27;s 2002 film &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; is based on &quot;The Two Towers&quot;. It adds some new material, such as the scene where Aragorn falls over a cliff; it imports some material from the preceding volume, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, such as the Wargs&#x27; attack on refugees from Edoras; and it leaves some material to be covered in the following film, such as the scene with the giant spider Shelob. The film was acclaimed by critics and was highly successful at the box office.

<text>The Return of the King is the third and final volume of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, following &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; and &quot;The Two Towers&quot;. It was published in 1955. The story begins in the kingdom of Gondor, which is soon to be attacked by the Dark Lord Sauron.

The volume was praised by literary figures including W. H. Auden, Anthony Price, and Michael Straight, but attacked by Edwin Muir, who had praised &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;.

The chapter &quot;The Scouring of the Shire&quot;, and a chapter-length narrative in the appendices, &quot;The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen&quot;, have attracted discussion by scholars and critics. &quot;The Scouring of the Shire&quot; has been called the most important chapter in the whole novel, providing in its internal quest to restore the Shire a counterbalance to the main quest to destroy the Ring. Commentators have read into it a variety of contemporary political allusions including a satire of socialism and a strand of environmentalism. Tolkien described &quot;The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen&quot; as essential to the plot of the novel. It covers events both before and after the main narrative, and differs from it in not being from the hobbits&#x27; point of view. Scholars have discussed the tale&#x27;s themes including love and death, Tolkien&#x27;s balance between open Christianity and treating the characters as pagan; and the fact that having the tale as an appendix deprives the main story of much of its love-interest.

== Title and publication ==

Tolkien conceived of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as a single work comprising six &quot;books&quot; plus extensive appendices. In 1953, he proposed titles for the six books to his publisher, Rayner Unwin; Book Five was to be &quot;The War of the Ring&quot;, while Book Six was to be &quot;The End of the Third Age&quot;. These titles were eventually used in the (2000) &quot;Millennium edition&quot;. Unwin however split the work into three volumes, publishing the fifth and sixth books with the appendices into the final volume with the title &quot;The Return of the King&quot;. Tolkien felt the chosen title revealed too much of the story, and indicated that he preferred &quot;The War of the Ring&quot; as a title for the volume.

&quot;The Return of the King&quot; was in the end published as the third and final volume of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, on 20 October 1955 in the UK.

== Contents ==

Some editions of the volume contain a synopsis for readers who have not read the earlier volumes. The body of the volume consists of books five and six. Book six has variously been titled &quot;The Return of the King&quot; (clashing with the title of the third volume) and &quot;The End of the Third Age&quot;, though in many editions the Books are untitled. The volume ends with a set of appendices and an index, varying in different editions.

=== Book V: The War of the Ring ===

Sauron sends a great army against Gondor. Gandalf arrives at Minas Tirith to warn Denethor of the attack, while Théoden musters the Rohirrim to ride to Gondor&#x27;s aid. Minas Tirith is besieged; the Lord of the Nazgûl uses a spell-wound battering ram to destroy the city&#x27;s gates. Denethor, deceived by Sauron, falls into despair. He burns himself alive on a pyre; Pippin and Gandalf rescue his son Faramir from the same fate.

Aragorn, accompanied by Legolas, Gimli, and the Rangers of the North, takes the Paths of the Dead to recruit the Dead Men of Dunharrow, oathbreakers who are bound by an ancient curse which denies them rest until they fulfil their oath to fight for the King of Gondor. Aragorn unleashes the Army of the Dead on the Corsairs of Umbar invading southern Gondor. With that threat eliminated, Aragorn uses the Corsairs&#x27; ships to transport the men of southern Gondor up the Anduin, reaching Minas Tirith just in time to turn the tide of battle. Théoden&#x27;s niece Éowyn, who joined the army in disguise, kills the Lord of the Nazgûl with help from Merry; both are wounded. Together, Gondor and Rohan defeat Sauron&#x27;s army in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, though at great cost; Théoden is among the dead.

Aragorn enters Minas Tirith and heals Faramir, Éowyn, and Merry. He leads an army of men from Gondor and Rohan, marching through Ithilien to the Black Gate to distract Sauron from his true danger. At the Battle of the Morannon, his army is vastly outnumbered.

=== Book VI: The End of the Third Age ===

Meanwhile, Sam rescues Frodo from the tower of Cirith Ungol. They set out across Mordor. When they reach the edge of the Cracks of Doom, Frodo cannot resist the Ring any longer. He claims it for himself and puts it on. Gollum suddenly reappears. He struggles with Frodo and bites off Frodo&#x27;s finger with the Ring still on it. Celebrating wildly, Gollum loses his footing and falls into the Fire, taking the Ring with him. When the Ring is destroyed, Sauron loses his power forever. All he created collapses, the Nazgûl perish, and his armies are thrown into such disarray that Aragorn&#x27;s forces emerge victorious.

Aragorn is crowned King of Arnor and Gondor, and weds Arwen, daughter of Elrond. Théoden is buried and Éomer is crowned King of Rohan. His sister Éowyn is engaged to marry Faramir, now Steward of Gondor and Prince of Ithilien. Galadriel, Celeborn, and Gandalf meet and say farewell to Treebeard, and to Aragorn.

The four hobbits make their way back to the Shire, only to find that it has been taken over by men directed by &quot;Sharkey&quot; (whom they later discover to be Saruman). The hobbits, led by Merry, raise a rebellion and scour the Shire of Sharkey&#x27;s evil. Gríma Wormtongue turns on Saruman and kills him in front of Bag End, Frodo&#x27;s home. He is killed in turn by hobbit archers. Merry and Pippin are celebrated as heroes. Sam marries Rosie Cotton and uses his gifts from Galadriel to help heal the Shire. But Frodo is still wounded in body and spirit, having borne the Ring for so long. A few years later, in the company of Bilbo and Gandalf, Frodo sails from the Grey Havens west over the Sea to the Undying Lands to find peace.

=== Appendices ===

The appendices outline more details of the history, cultures, genealogies, and languages that Tolkien imagined for the peoples of Middle-earth. They provide background details for the narrative, with much detail for Tolkien fans who want to know more about the stories.

==== &quot;Annals of the Kings and Rulers&quot; ====

Provides extensive background to the larger world of Middle-earth, with brief overviews of the events of the first two Ages of the world, and then more detailed histories of the nations of Men in Gondor and Rohan, as well as a history of the royal Dwarvish line of Durin during the Third Age.

The embedded &quot;Tale of Aragorn and Arwen&quot; tells how it happened that an immortal elf came to marry a man, as told in the main story, which Arwen&#x27;s ancestor Lúthien had done in the First Age, giving up her immortality.

==== &quot;The Tale of Years&quot; (Chronology of the Westlands) ====

Provides a timeline of events throughout the series, and ancient events affecting the narrative, and in lesser detail, it gives the stories&#x27; context in the fictional chronology of the larger mythology.

It tells that Sam gives his daughter Elanor the fictional &quot;Red Book of Westmarch&quot; – which contains the autobiographical stories of Bilbo&#x27;s adventures at the opening of the war, and Frodo&#x27;s role in the full-on War of the Ring, and serves as Tolkien&#x27;s source for &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (with Tolkien representing himself as a translator, rather than an epic novelist). It says that there was &quot;a tradition&quot; that after handing over the book, Sam crossed west over the sea himself, the last of the ring-bearers; and that some years later, after the deaths of Aragorn and Arwen, Legolas and Gimli also sailed together &quot;over Sea&quot;.

==== &quot;Family Trees&quot; (Hobbits) ====

Gives hobbit genealogies – not only for Bilbo and Frodo&#x27;s Baggins family, but also their relations the Tooks and Brandybucks, which connect them to Pippin and Merry.

==== &quot;Calendars&quot; ====

Describes some of the calendars used by the characters in the story, and explains that the Roman month names in the text are &quot;translations&quot; of the names in the hobbits&#x27; calendar. (Tolkien was a linguist, and provided Germanic-sounding names for the hobbit calendar by extrapolating names of German and Old English months forward to what he thought they might have become if all were still used in modern English, as &quot;Yule&quot; and &quot;Easter&quot; are.)

==== &quot;Writing and Spelling&quot; ====

Describes dwarves&#x27; runes and the elvish runes used by the other peoples of Middle-earth; the names of the runes and letters incidentally give some information about dwarvish and elvish languages.

==== &quot;Languages and Peoples of the Third Age&quot; and &quot;On Translation&quot; ====

Presented as two sections. In addition to outlines of the various languages in current use during the narrative, and mentioned or seen in the story, it discusses hobbits&#x27; names at length. It sorts out names which Tolkien pretended to have translated into English, and names which he said he had left in their original form (since they had no meaning in hobbits&#x27; everyday language).

== Reception ==

=== Of the volume ===


In a review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the poet W. H. Auden praised &quot;The Return of the King&quot; and found &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; a &quot;masterpiece of the genre&quot;.
The science fiction author and critic Anthony Boucher, in a review for &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction&quot;, praised the volume as &quot;a masterly narration of tremendous and terrible climactic events&quot;, but wrote that Tolkien&#x27;s prose &quot;seems sometimes to be protracted for its own sake&quot;.
The author Anthony Price, reviewing the novel for &quot;The Oxford Mail&quot;, called it &quot;more than immense; it is complete&quot;, praising Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth as &quot;an absolutely real and unendingly exciting world&quot;. He admired the characterization of Tom Bombadil, the Ents, and Gollum. In his view, the One Ring was destroyed &quot;with terrifying logic&quot;, though he did not demand that the text end there, noting that the hobbits&#x27; return to the Shire put the larger events in perspective.

The novelist and publisher Michael Straight, reviewing the whole of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in &quot;The New Republic&quot;, wrote that the devastated landscapes in the work recalled Tolkien&#x27;s First World War experiences, just as the snowstorm in the Misty Mountains recalled his climbing trip in Switzerland, and the Shire reflected England. He concluded by calling the novel a work of genius.

The Scottish poet and critic Edwin Muir, who had praised &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; in 1954, attacked the completed book in 1955 in &quot;The Sunday Observer&quot; as &quot;a boy&#x27;s adventure story&quot;. He compared it to the works of Rider Haggard, and stated that &quot;except for a few old wizards&quot;, all the characters &quot;are boys masquerading as adult[s]&quot;.

=== Of &quot;The Scouring of the Shire&quot; ===

Critics have considered the volume&#x27;s penultimate chapter, &quot;The Scouring of the Shire&quot;, the most important chapter in the whole of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Although Tolkien denied that the chapter was an allegory for Britain in the aftermath of World War II, commentators have argued that it can be applied to that period, with clear contemporary political references that include a satire of socialism, echoes of Nazism, allusions to the shortages in postwar Britain, and a strand of environmentalism. According to Tolkien, the idea of such a chapter was planned from the outset as part of the overall formal structure of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, though its details were not worked out until much later. The chapter was intended to counterbalance the larger plot, concerning the physical journey to destroy the One Ring, with a moral quest upon the return home, to purify the Shire and to take personal responsibility. Tolkien considered other identities for the wicked Sharkey before settling on Saruman late in his composition process. The chapter has been called one of the most famous anticlimaxes in literature.

=== Of &quot;The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen&quot; ===

Tolkien called &quot;The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen&quot;, in the appendices at the end of the volume, &quot;really essential to the story&quot;. In contrast to the non-narrative appendices it extends the main story of the book to cover events both before and after it, one reason it would not fit in the main text. Tolkien gave another reason for its exclusion, namely that the main text is told from the hobbits&#x27; point of view. The tale to some extent mirrors the &quot;Tale of Beren and Lúthien&quot;, also a story of the love between a Man and an Elf, set in an earlier age of Middle-earth. This creates a feeling of historical depth, in what scholars note is an approach similar to that of Dante in his &quot;Inferno&quot;. Aspects of the tale discussed by scholars include the nature of love and death; the balance Tolkien strikes between open Christianity and his treatment of his characters as pagan; and the resulting paradox that although Tolkien was a Roman Catholic and considered the book fundamentally Catholic, Middle-earth societies lack religions of their own. It has been noted also that the tale&#x27;s relegation to an appendix deprives the main story of much of its love-interest, shifting the book&#x27;s emphasis towards action.

<text>A cemetery, burial ground, gravesite, graveyard, or a green space called a memorial park, is a place where the remains of many dead people are buried or otherwise interred. The word &quot;cemetery&quot; (from Greek ) implies that the land is specifically designated as a burial ground and originally applied to the Roman catacombs. The term &quot;graveyard&quot; is often used interchangeably with cemetery, but a graveyard primarily refers to a burial ground within a churchyard.

The intact or cremated remains of people may be interred in a grave, commonly referred to as burial, or in a tomb, an &quot;above-ground grave&quot; (resembling a sarcophagus), a mausoleum, a columbarium, a niche, or another edifice. In Western cultures, funeral ceremonies are often observed in cemeteries. These ceremonies or rites of passage differ according to cultural practices and religious beliefs. Modern cemeteries often include crematoria, and some grounds previously used for both continue as crematoria as a principal use long after the interment areas have been filled.

==History==
===Palaeolithic===
The Taforalt cave in Morocco is possibly the oldest known cemetery in the world. It was the resting place of at least 34 Iberomaurusian individuals, the bulk of whom have been dated to 15,100 to 14,000 years ago.

===Neolithic===

Neolithic cemeteries are sometimes referred to by the term &quot;grave field&quot;. They are one of the chief sources of information on ancient and prehistoric cultures, and numerous archaeological cultures are defined by their burial customs, such as the
Urnfield culture of the European Bronze Age.

===Middle Ages===
During the Early Middle Ages, the reopening of graves and manipulation of the corpses or artifacts contained within them was a widespread phenomenon and a common part of the life course of early medieval cemeteries across Western and Central Europe. The reopening of furnished or recent burials occurred over the broad zone of European row-grave-style furnished inhumation burial, especially from the 5th to the 8th centuries CE, which comprised the regions of today&#x27;s Romania, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, the Low Countries, France, and south-eastern England.

===Early Christianity===


From about the 7th century CE, in Europe a burial was under the control of the Church and could only take place on consecrated church ground. Practices varied, but in continental Europe, bodies were usually buried in a mass grave until they had decomposed. The bones were then exhumed and stored in ossuaries, either along the arcaded bounding walls of the cemetery or within the church under floor slabs and behind walls.

In most cultures those who were vastly rich, had important professions, were part of the nobility or were of any other high social status were usually buried in individual crypts inside or beneath the relevant place of worship with an indication of their name, date of death and other biographical data. In Europe, this was often accompanied by a depiction of their coat of arms.

Most others were buried in graveyards again divided by social status. Mourners who could afford the work of a stonemason had a headstone engraved with a name, dates of birth and death and sometimes other biographical data, and set up over the place of burial. Usually, the more writing and symbols carved on the headstone, the more expensive it was. As with most other human property such as houses and means of transport, richer families used to compete for the artistic value of their family headstone in comparison to others around it, sometimes adding a statue (such as a weeping angel) on the top of the grave.

Those who could not pay for a headstone at all usually had some religious symbol made from wood on the place of burial such as a Christian cross; however, this would quickly deteriorate under the rain or snow. Some families hired a blacksmith and had large crosses made from various metals put on the places of burial.

===Modernity===

Starting in the early 19th century, the burial of the dead in graveyards began to be discontinued, due to rapid population growth in the early stages of the Industrial Revolution, continued outbreaks of infectious disease near graveyards and the increasingly limited space in graveyards for new interments. In many European states, burial in graveyards was eventually outlawed altogether through legislation.

Instead of graveyards, completely new places of burial were established away from heavily populated areas and outside of old towns and city centers. Many new cemeteries became municipally owned or were run by their own corporations, and thus independent from churches and their churchyards.

In some cases, skeletons were exhumed from graveyards and moved into ossuaries or catacombs. A large action of this type occurred in 18th century Paris when human remains were transferred from graveyards all over the city to the Catacombs of Paris. The bones of an estimated six million people are to be found there.

An early example of a landscape-style cemetery is Père Lachaise in Paris. This embodied the idea of state- rather than church-controlled burial, a concept that spread through the continent of Europe with the Napoleonic invasions. This could include the opening of cemeteries by private or joint stock companies. The shift to municipal cemeteries or those established by private companies was usually accompanied by the establishing of landscaped burial grounds outside the city (e.g. extramural).

In Britain the movement was driven by dissenters and public health concerns. The Rosary Cemetery in Norwich was opened in 1819 as a burial ground for all religious backgrounds. Similar private non-denominational cemeteries were established near industrialising towns with growing populations, such as Manchester (1821) and Liverpool (1825). Each cemetery required a separate Act of Parliament for authorisation, although the capital was raised through the formation of joint-stock companies.

In the first 50 years of the 19th century the population of London more than doubled from 1 million to 2.3 million. The small parish churchyards were rapidly becoming dangerously overcrowded, and decaying matter infiltrating the water supply was causing epidemics. The issue became particularly acute after the cholera epidemic of 1831, which killed 52,000 people in Britain alone, putting unprecedented pressure on the country&#x27;s burial capacity. Concerns were also raised about the potential public health hazard arising from the inhalation of gases generated from human putrefaction under the then prevailing miasma theory of disease.

Legislative action was slow in coming, but in 1832 Parliament finally acknowledged the need for the establishment of large municipal cemeteries and encouraged their construction outside London. The same bill also closed all inner London churchyards to new deposits. The Magnificent Seven, seven large cemeteries around London, were established in the following decade, starting with Kensal Green in 1832.

Urban planner and author John Claudius Loudon was one of the first professional cemetery designers, and his book &quot;On the Laying Out, Planting and Managing of Cemeteries&quot; (1843) was very influential on designers and architects of the period. Loudon himself designed three cemeteries – Bath Abbey Cemetery, Histon Road Cemetery, Cambridge, and Southampton Old Cemetery.

The Metropolitan Burial Act 1852 legislated for the establishment of the first national system of government-funded municipal cemeteries across the country, opening the way for a massive expansion of burial facilities throughout the late 19th century.

In the United States, rural cemeteries became recreational areas in a time before public parks, hosting events from casual picnics to hunts and carriage races.

==Types==


There are a number of different styles of cemetery in use. Many cemeteries have areas based on different styles, reflecting the diversity of cultural practices around death and how it changes over time.

===Urban===

The urban cemetery is a burial ground located in the interior of a village, town, or city. Early urban cemeteries were churchyards, which filled quickly and exhibited a haphazard placement of burial markers as sextons tried to squeeze new burials into the remaining space. As new burying grounds were established in urban areas to compensate, burial plots were often laid out in a grid to replace the chaotic appearance of the churchyard. Urban cemeteries developed over time into a more landscaped form as part of civic development of beliefs and institutions that sought to portray the city as civilized and harmonious.

Urban cemeteries were more sanitary (a place to safely dispose of decomposing corpses) than they were aesthetically pleasing. Corpses were usually buried wrapped in cloth, since coffins, burial vaults, and above-ground crypts inhibited the process of decomposition. Nonetheless, urban cemeteries which were heavily used were often very unhealthy. Receiving vaults and crypts often needed to be aired before entering, as decomposing corpses used up so much oxygen that even candles could not remain lit. The sheer stench from decomposing corpses, even when buried deeply, was overpowering in areas adjacent to the urban cemetery. Decomposition of the human body releases significant pathogenic bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and viruses which can cause disease and illness, and many urban cemeteries were located without consideration for local groundwater. Modern burials in urban cemeteries also release toxic chemicals associated with embalming, such as arsenic, formaldehyde, and mercury. Coffins and burial equipment can also release significant amounts of toxic chemicals such as arsenic (used to preserve coffin wood) and formaldehyde (used in varnishes and as a sealant) and toxic metals such as copper, lead, and zinc (from coffin handles and flanges).

Urban cemeteries relied heavily on the fact that the soft parts of the body would decompose in about 25 years (although, in moist soil, decomposition can take up to 70 years). If room for new burials was needed, older bones could be dug up and interred elsewhere (such as in an ossuary) to make space for new interments. It was not uncommon in some places, such as England, for fresher corpses to be chopped up to aid decomposition, and for bones to be burned to create fertilizer. The re-use of graves allowed for a steady stream of income, which enabled the cemetery to remain well-maintained and in good repair. Not all urban cemeteries engaged in re-use of graves, and cultural taboos often prevented it. Many urban cemeteries have fallen into disrepair and become overgrown, as they lacked endowments to fund perpetual care. Many urban cemeteries today are thus home to wildlife, birds, and plants which cannot be found anywhere else in the urban area, and many urban cemeteries in the late 20th century touted their role as an environmental refuge.

Many urban cemeteries are characterized by multiple burials in the same grave. Multiple burials is a consequence of the limited size of the urban cemetery, which cannot easily expand due to adjacent building development. It was not uncommon for an urban cemetery to begin adding soil to the top of the cemetery to create new burial space.

===Monumental===

A &quot;monumental cemetery&quot; is the traditional style of cemetery where headstones or other monuments made of marble, granite or similar materials rise vertically above the ground (typically around 50 cm but some can be over 2 metres high). Often the entire grave is covered by a slab, commonly concrete, but it can be more expensive materials such as marble or granite, and/or has its boundaries delimited by a fence which may be made of concrete, cast iron or timber. Where a number of family members are buried together (either vertically or horizontally), the slab or boundaries may encompass a number of graves.

Monumental cemeteries are often regarded as unsightly due to the random collection of monuments and headstones they contain. Also, as maintenance of the headstones is the responsibility of family members (in the absence of a proscribed Perpetual Care and Maintenance Fund), over time many headstones are forgotten about and decay and become damaged. For cemetery authorities, monumental cemeteries are difficult to maintain. While cemeteries often have grassed areas between graves, the layout of graves makes it difficult to use modern equipment such as ride-on lawn mowers in the cemetery. Often the maintenance of grass must be done by more labour-intensive (and therefore expensive) methods. In order to reduce the labour cost, devices such as string trimmers are increasingly used in cemetery maintenance, but such devices can damage the monuments and headstones. Cemetery authorities dislike the criticism they receive for the deteriorating condition of the headstones, arguing that they have no responsibility for the upkeep of headstones, and typically disregard their own maintenance practices as being one of the causes of that deterioration. 

===Rural or garden===



The rural cemetery or garden cemetery is a style of burial ground that uses landscaping in a park-like setting. It was conceived in 1711 by the British architect Sir Christopher Wren, who advocated the creation of landscaped burial grounds which featured well-planned walkways which gave extensive access to graves and planned plantings of trees, bushes, and flowers. Wren&#x27;s idea was not immediately accepted. But by the early 1800s, existing churchyards were growing overcrowded and unhealthy, with graves stacked upon each other or emptied and reused for new burials. As a reaction to this, the first &quot;garden&quot; cemetery – Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris – opened in 1804. Because these cemeteries were usually on the outskirts of town (where land was plentiful and cheap), they were called &quot;rural cemeteries&quot;, a term still used to describe them today. The concept quickly spread across Europe.
Garden/rural cemeteries were not necessarily outside city limits. When land within a city could be found, the cemetery was enclosed with a wall to give it a garden-like quality. These cemeteries were often not sectarian, nor co-located with a house of worship. Inspired by the English landscape garden movement, they often looked like attractive parks. The first garden/rural cemetery in the United States was Mount Auburn Cemetery near Boston, Massachusetts, founded by the Massachusetts Horticultural Society in 1831. Following the establishment of Mount Auburn, dozens of other &quot;rural&quot; cemeteries were established in the United States – perhaps in part because of Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story&#x27;s dedication address – and there were dozens of dedication addresses, including the famous Gettysburg Address of President Abraham Lincoln.

The cost of building a garden/rural cemetery often meant that only the wealthy could afford burial there. Subsequently, garden/rural cemeteries often feature above-ground monuments and memorials, mausoleums, and columbaria. The excessive filling of rural/garden cemeteries with elaborate above-ground memorials, many of dubious artistic quality or taste, created a backlash which led to the development of the lawn cemetery.

===Lawn cemetery===
In a review of British burial and death practises, Julie Rugg wrote that there were &quot;four closely interlinked factors that explain the &#x27;invention&#x27; and widespread adoption of the lawn cemetery: the deterioration of the Victorian cemetery; a self-conscious rejection of Victorian aesthetics in favour of modern alternatives; resource difficulties that, particularly after World War II, increasingly constrained what might be achieved in terms of cemetery maintenance; and growing professionalism in the field of cemetery management.&quot;

Typically, lawn cemeteries comprise a number of graves in a lawn setting with trees and gardens on the perimeter. Adolph Strauch introduced this style in 1855 in Cincinnati.
While aesthetic appeal to family members has been the primary driver for the development of lawn cemeteries, cemetery authorities initially welcomed this new style of cemetery enthusiastically, expecting easier maintenance. Selecting (or grading) the land intended for a lawn cemetery so that it is completely flat allows the use of large efficient mowers (such as ride-on mowers or lawn tractors) - the plaques (being horizontally set in the ground) lie below the level of the blades and are not damaged by the blades. In practice, while families are often initially attracted to the uncluttered appearance of a lawn cemetery, the common practice of placing flowers (sometimes in vases) and increasingly other items (e.g. small toys on children&#x27;s graves) re-introduces some clutter to the cemetery and makes it difficult to use the larger mowers. While cemetery authorities increasingly impose restrictions on the nature and type of objects that can be placed on lawn graves and actively remove prohibited items, grieving families are often unwilling to comply with these restrictions and become very upset if the items are removed. Another problem with lawn cemeteries involves grass over-growth over time: the grass can grow over and cover the plaque, to the distress of families who can no longer easily locate the grave. Grasses that propagate by an above-ground stolon (runner) can cover a plaque very quickly. Grasses that propagate by a below-ground rhizome tend not to cover the plaque as easily.


==== Lawn beam ====

The lawn beam cemetery, a recent development, seeks to solve the problems of the lawn cemetery while retaining many of its benefits. Low (10–15 cm) raised concrete slabs (beams) are placed across the cemetery. Commemorative plaques (usually standardised in terms of size and materials similar to lawn cemeteries) stand on these beams adjacent to each grave. As in a lawn cemetery, grass grows over the graves themselves. The areas between the beams are wide enough to permit easy mowing with a larger mower. As the mower blades are set lower than the top of the beam and the mowers do not go over the beam, the blades cannot damage the plaques. Up on the beam, the plaques cannot be easily overgrown by grass, and spaces between the plaques permit families to place flowers and other objects out of reach of the mowing.

===Natural===
A &quot;natural cemetery,&quot; &quot;eco-cemetery,&quot; &quot;green cemetery&quot; or &quot;conservation cemetery&quot;, is a new style of cemetery as an area set aside for natural burials (with or without coffins). Natural burials are motivated by a desire to be environmentally conscious with the body rapidly decomposing and becoming part of the natural environment without incurring the environmental cost of traditional burials. Certifications may be granted for various levels of green burial. Green burial certifications are issued in a tiered system reflecting level of natural burial practice. Green burial certification standards designate a cemetery as Hybrid, Natural, or Conservation Burial Grounds.

Many scientists have argued that natural burials would be a highly efficient use of land if designed specifically to save endangered habitats, ecosystems and species.

The opposite has also been proposed. Instead of letting natural burials permanently protect wild landscapes, others have argued that the rapid decomposition of a natural burial, in principle, allows for the quick re-use of grave sites in comparison with conventional burials. However, it is unclear if reusing cemetery land will be culturally acceptable to most people.

In keeping with the intention of &quot;returning to nature&quot; and the early re-use potential, natural cemeteries do not normally have conventional grave markings such as headstones. Instead, exact GPS recordings and or the placing of a tree, bush or rock often marks the location of the dead, so grieving family and friends can visit the precise location of a grave.

===Columbarium wall===

&quot;Columbarium walls&quot; are a common feature of many cemeteries, reflecting the increasing use of cremation rather than burial. While cremated remains can be kept at home by families in urns or scattered in some significant or attractive place, neither of these approaches allows for a long-lasting commemorative plaque to honour the dead nor provide a place for the wider circle of friends and family to come to mourn or visit. Therefore, many cemeteries now provide walls (typically of brick or rendered brick construction) with a rectangular array of niches, with each niche being big enough to accommodate a person&#x27;s cremated remains. Columbarium walls are a very space-efficient use of land in a cemetery compared with burials and a niche in a columbarium wall is a much cheaper alternative to a burial plot. A small plaque (about 15 cm x 10 cm) can be affixed across the front of each niche and is generally included as part of the price of a niche. As the writing on the plaques has to be fairly small to fit on the small size of the plaque, the design of columbarium walls is constrained by the ability of visitors to read the plaques. Thus, the niches are typically placed between 1 metre to 2 metres above the ground so the plaques can be easily read by an adult. Some columbarium walls have niches going close to ground level, but these niches are usually unpopular with families as it is difficult to read the plaque without bending down very low (something older people in particular find difficult or uncomfortable to do).

As with graves, the niches may be assigned by the cemetery authorities or families may choose from the unoccupied niches available. It is usually possible to purchase (or pay a deposit) to reserve the use of adjacent niches for other family members. The use of adjacent niches (vertically or horizontally) usually permits a larger plaque spanning all the niches involved, which provides more space for the writing. As with graves, there may be separate columbarium walls for different religions or for war veterans. As with lawn cemeteries, the original expectation was that people would prefer the uncluttered simplicity of a wall of plaques, but the practice of leaving flowers is very entrenched. Mourners leave flowers (and other objects) on top of columbarium walls or at the base, as close as they can to the plaque of their family member. In some cases, it is possible to squeeze a piece of wire or string under the plaque allowing a flower or small posy to be placed on the plaque itself or clips are glued onto the plaque for that purpose. Newer designs of columbarium walls take this desire to leave flowers into account by incorporating a metal clip or loop beside each plaque, typically designed to hold a single flower stem or a small posy. As the flowers decay, they simply fall to the ground and do not create a significant maintenance problem.

===Family===

While uncommon today, family (or private) cemeteries were a matter of practicality during the settlement of America. If a municipal or religious cemetery had not been established, settlers would seek out a small plot of land, often in wooded areas bordering their fields, to begin a family plot. Sometimes, several families would arrange to bury their dead together. While some of these sites later grew into true cemeteries, many were forgotten after a family moved away or died out.

Today, it is not unheard of to discover groupings of tombstones, ranging from a few to a dozen or more, on undeveloped land. As late 20th-century suburban sprawl pressured the pace of development in formerly rural areas, it became increasingly common for larger exurban properties to be encumbered by &quot;religious easements&quot;, which are legal requirements for the property owner to permit periodic maintenance of small burial plots located on the property but technically not owned with it. Often, cemeteries are relocated to accommodate building. However, if the cemetery is not relocated, descendants of people buried there may visit the cemetery.

There is also the practice of families with large estates choosing to create private cemeteries in the form of burial sites, monuments, crypts, or mausoleums on their property; the mausoleum at Fallingwater is an example of this practice. Burial of a body at a site may protect the location from redevelopment, with such estates often being placed in the care of a trust or foundation. In the United States, state regulations have made it increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to start private cemeteries; many require a plan to care for the site in perpetuity. Private cemeteries are nearly always forbidden on incorporated residential zones.
Many people will bury a beloved pet on the family property.

===Arabian tribal===
All of the Saudis in Al Baha are Muslims, and this is reflected in their cemetery and funeral customs. &quot;The southern tribal hinterland of Baha – home to especially the Al-Ghamdi and Al-Zahrani tribes – has been renowned for centuries for their tribal cemeteries that are now slowly vanishing&quot;, according to the &quot;Asharq Al-Awsat&quot; newspaper: &quot;One old villager explained how tribal cemeteries came about. &#x27;People used to die in large numbers and very rapidly one after the other because of diseases. So the villagers would dig graves close by burying members of the same family in one area. That was how the family and tribal burial grounds came about... If the family ran out of space, they would open old graves where family members had been buried before and add more people to them.

This process is known as &quot;khashf&quot;. During famines and outbreaks of epidemics huge numbers of people would die and many tribes faced difficulties in digging new graves because of the difficult weather. In the past, some Arab winters lasted for more than six months and would be accompanied with much rain and fog, impeding movement. But due to tribal rivalries many families would guard their cemeteries and put restrictions on who was buried in them. Across Baha, burial grounds have been constructed in different ways. Some cemeteries consist of underground vaults or concrete burial chambers with the capacity of holding many bodies simultaneously. Such vaults include windows for people to peer through and are usually decorated ornately with text, drawings, and patterns. At least one resident believes that the graves unique in the region because many are not oriented toward Mecca, and therefore must pre-date Islam.

===Terraced===
Graves are terraced in Yagoto Cemetery, which is an urban cemetery situated in a hilly area in Nagoya, Japan, effectively creating stone walls blanketing hillsides.

===Miscellaneous===
The Cross Bones is a burial ground for prostitutes in London. The Neptune Memorial Reef is an underwater columbarium near Key Biscayne.

=== Online memorials ===
In the 2000s and 2010s, it has become increasingly common for cemeteries and funeral homes to offer online services. There are also stand-alone online &quot;cemeteries&quot; such as DiscoverEverAfter Find a Grave, Canadian Headstones, Interment.net, and the World Wide Cemetery.

==Customs and practices==
===Flowers===

In Western countries, and many others, visitors to graves commonly leave cut flowers, especially during major holidays and on birthdays or relevant anniversaries. Cemeteries usually dispose of these flowers after a few weeks in order to keep the space maintained. Some companies offer perpetual flower services, to ensure a grave is always decorated with fresh flowers. Flowers may often be planted on the grave as well, usually immediately in front of the gravestone. For this purpose roses are highly common.

In some regions flowers are put out at specific times called Decoration Days.

===Stones===

Visitors to loved ones interred in Jewish cemeteries often leave a small stone on the top of the headstone. There are prayers said at the gravesite, and the stone is left on the visitor&#x27;s departure. It is done as a show of respect; as a general rule, flowers are not placed at Jewish graves. Flowers are fleeting; the symbology inherent in the use of a stone is to show that the love, honor, memories, and soul of the loved one are eternal. This practice is seen in the closing scene of the film &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;, although in that case it is not on a Jewish grave.

===Crosses===

War graves will commonly have small timber remembrance crosses left with a red poppy attached to its centre. These will often have messages written on the cross. More formal visits will often leave a poppy wreath. Jewish war graves are sometimes marked by a timber Star of David.

===Candles===

Placing burning grave candles on the cemetery to commemorate the dead is a very common tradition in Catholic nations, for example, Poland. It is mostly practised on All Souls&#x27; Day. The traditional grave candles are called &quot;znicz&quot; in Polish. A similar practice of grave candles is also used in Eastern Orthodox Christian nations, as well as the Lutheran Christian Nordic countries.

===Toys===
In the American South, graves of children are often decorated with emblems of childhood. These include favorite toys, balloons, seasonal decorations, religious figurines, and more.

== Contemporary management ==

Traditionally, cemetery management only involves the allocation of land for burial, the digging and filling of graves, and the maintenance of the grounds and landscaping. The construction and maintenance of headstones and other grave monuments are usually the responsibilities of surviving families and friends. However, increasingly, many people regard the resultant collection of individual headstones, concrete slabs and fences (some of which may be decayed or damaged) to be aesthetically unappealing, leading to new cemetery developments either standardising the shape or design of headstones or plaques, sometimes by providing a standard shaped marker as part of the service provided by the cemetery.

=== Grave digging ===
Cemetery authorities normally employ a full-time staff of caretakers to dig graves. The term &quot;gravedigger&quot; is still used in casual speech, though many cemeteries have adopted the term &quot;caretaker&quot;, since their duties often involve maintenance of the cemetery grounds and facilities. The employment of skilled personnel for the preparation of graves is done not only to ensure the grave is dug in the correct location and at the correct depth, but also to relieve families from having to dig the grave for a recently dead relative, and as a matter of public safety, in order to prevent inexperienced visitors from injuring themselves, to ensure unused graves are properly covered, and to avoid legal liability that would result from an injury related to an improperly dug or uncovered grave.

Preparation of the grave usually begins before mourners arrive for the burial. The cemetery caretakers fill the grave after the burial, generally after the mourners have departed. Mechanical equipment, such as backhoes, are used to reduce labour cost of digging and filling, but some hand shovelling may still be required.

In the United Kingdom the minimum depth from the surface to the highest lid is . There must be between each coffin, which on average is high. If the soil is free-draining and porous, only of soil on top is required. Coffins may be interred at lesser depths or even above ground as long as they are encased in a concrete chamber. Before 1977, double graves were dug to and singles to . As a single grave is now dug to , old cemeteries contain many areas where new single graves can be dug on &quot;old ground&quot;. This is considered a valid method of resource management and provides income to keep older cemeteries viable, thus forestalling the need for permanent closure, which would result in a reduction of their work force.

=== Cemetery key ===

The key is a central element of Christianity. Keys of death and hell as a metaphor and synonym for these often stands the cemetery key. Today it is also integrated in many games as the &quot;graveyard key holder&quot;.

=== Burial registers ===
Usually there is a legal requirement to maintain records regarding the burials (or interment of ashes) within a cemetery. These burial registers usually contain (at a minimum) the name of the person buried, the date of burial and the location of the burial plots within the cemetery, although some contain far more detail. The Arlington National Cemetery, one of the United States&#x27; largest military cemeteries, has a registry, &quot;The ANC Explorer&quot;, which contains details such as photographs of the front and back of the tombstones. Burial registers are an important resource for genealogy.

=== Land use ===
In order to physically manage the space within the cemetery (to avoid burials in existing graves) and to record locations in the burial register, most cemeteries have some systematic layout of graves in rows, generally grouped into larger sections as required. Often the cemetery displays this information in the form of a map, which is used both by the cemetery administration in managing their land use and also by friends and family members seeking to locate a particular grave within the cemetery.

=== Pressures ===

Cemetery authorities face a number of tensions in regard to the management of cemeteries.

One issue relates to cost. Traditionally, a single payment is made at the time of burial, but the cemetery authority incurs expenses in cemetery maintenance over many decades. Many cemetery authorities find that their accumulated funds are not sufficient for the costs of long-term maintenance. This shortfall in funds for maintenance results in three main options: charge much higher prices for new burials, obtain some other kind of public subsidy, or neglect maintenance. For cemeteries without space for new burials, the options are even more limited. Public attitudes towards subsidies are highly variable. People with family buried in local cemeteries are usually quite concerned about neglect of cemetery maintenance and will usually argue in favour of public subsidy of local cemetery maintenance, whereas other people without personal connection to the cemetery often argue that public subsidies of private cemeteries is an inappropriate use of their taxes. Some jurisdictions require a certain amount of money be set aside in perpetuity and invested so that the interest earned can be used for maintenance.

Another issue relates to limited amount of land. In many larger towns and cities, the older cemeteries which were initially considered to be large often run out of space for new burials and there is no vacant adjacent land available to extend the cemetery or even land in the same general area to create new cemeteries. New cemeteries are generally established on the periphery of towns and cities, where large tracts of land are still available. However, people often wish to be buried in the same cemetery as other relatives, and are not interested in being buried in new cemeteries with which there is no sense of connection to their family, creating pressure to find more space in existing cemeteries.

A third issue is the maintenance of monuments and headstones, which are generally the responsibility of families, but often become neglected over time. Decay and damage through vandalism or cemetery maintenance practices can render monuments and headstones either unsafe or at least unsightly. On the other hand, some families do not forget the grave but constantly visit, leaving behind flowers, plants, and other decorative items that create their own maintenance problem.

===Re-use of graves===
All of these issues tend to put pressure on the re-use of grave sites within cemeteries. The re-use of graves already used for burial can cause considerable upset to family members. Although the authorities might declare that the grave is sufficiently old that there will be no human remains still present, nonetheless many people regard the re-use of graves (particularly their family&#x27;s graves) as a desecration. Also re-use of a used grave involves the removal of any monuments and headstones, which may cause further distress to families (although families will typically be allowed to take away the monuments and headstones if they wish).

On the other hand, cemetery authorities are well aware that many old graves are forgotten and not visited and that their re-use will not cause distress to anyone. However, there may be some older graves in a cemetery for whom there are local and vocal descendants who will mount a public campaign against re-use. One pragmatic strategy is to publicly announce plans to re-use older graves and invite families to respond if they are willing or not. Re-use then only occurs where there are no objections allowing the &quot;forgotten&quot; graves to be re-used. Sometimes the cemetery authorities request a further payment to avoid re-use of a grave, but often this backfires politically.

A practical problem with regard to contacting families is that the person who initially purchased the burial plot(s) may have subsequently died and locating living family members, if any, many decades later is virtually impossible (or at least prohibitively expensive). Public notice about the proposed re-use of graves may or may not reach family members living further afield who may object to such practices. Therefore, it is possible that re-use could occur without family awareness.

Some cemeteries did foresee the need for re-use and included in their original terms and conditions a limited tenure on a grave site and most new cemeteries follow this practice, having seen the problems faced by older cemeteries. Common practice in Europe is to place bones in an ossuary after the proscribed burial period is over.

However, even when the cemetery has the legal right to re-use a grave, strong public opinion often forces the authorities to back down on that re-use. Also, even when cemeteries have a limited tenure provision in place, funding shortages can force them to contemplate re-use earlier than the original arrangements provided for.

Another type of grave site considered for re-use are empty plots purchased years ago but never used. In principle it would seem easier to &quot;re-use&quot; such grave sites as there can be no claims of desecration, but often this is made complicated by the legal rights to be buried obtained by the pre-purchase, as any limited tenure clause only takes effect after there has been a burial. Again, cemetery authorities suspect that in many cases the holders of these burial rights are probably dead and that nobody will exercise that burial right, but again some families are aware of the burial rights they possess and do intend to exercise them as and when family members die. Again the difficulty of being unable to locate the holders of these burial rights complicates the re-use of those graves.

As historic cemeteries begin to reach their capacity for full burials, alternative memorialization, such as collective memorials for cremated individuals, is becoming more common. Different cultures have different attitudes to destruction of cemeteries and use of the land for construction. In some countries it is considered normal to destroy the graves, while in others the graves are traditionally respected for a century or more. In many cases, after a suitable period of time has elapsed, the headstones are removed and the now former cemetery is converted to a recreational park or construction site. A more recent trend, particularly in South American cities, involves constructing high-rise buildings to house graves.

Cemeteries in the US may be relocated if the land is required for other reasons. For instance, many cemeteries in the southeastern United States were relocated by the Tennessee Valley Authority from areas about to be flooded by dam construction. Cemeteries may also be moved so that the land can be reused for transportation structures, public buildings, or even private development. Cemetery relocation is not necessarily possible in other parts of the world; in Alberta, Canada, for instance, the &quot;Cemetery Act&quot; expressly forbids the relocation of cemeteries or the mass exhumation of marked graves for any reason whatsoever. This has caused significant problems in the provision of transportation services to the southern half of Calgary, as the main southbound road connecting the south end of the city with downtown threads through a series of cemeteries founded in the 1930s. The light rail transit line running to the south end eventually had to be built directly under the road.

In Singapore, burials are limited to 15 years before graves are exhumed. This has led to a preference of cremation over burial among Singaporeans.

==Superstitions==
In many countries, cemeteries are places believed to hold both superstition and legend characteristics, being used, usually at night times, as an altar in supposed black magic ceremonies or similarly clandestine happenings, such as devil worshipping, grave-robbing (gold teeth and jewelry are preferred), thrilling sex encounters, or drug and alcohol abuse not related to the cemetery aura.

The legend of zombies, as romanticized by Wade Davis in &quot;The Serpent and the Rainbow&quot;, is not exceptional among cemetery myths, as cemeteries are believed to be places where witches and sorcerers get skulls and bones needed for their sinister rituals.

In the Afro-Brazilian urban mythos (such as Umbanda), there is a character loosely related to cemeteries and its aura: the Zé Pilintra (in fact, Zé Pilintra is more related to bohemianism and night life than with cemeteries, where the reigning entity is &quot;Exu Caveira&quot; or &quot;Exu Cemitério&quot;, similar to Voodoo Baron Samedi).

<text>In philosophy, rationalism is the epistemological view that &quot;regards reason as the chief source and test of knowledge&quot; or “the position that reason has precedence over other ways of acquiring knowledge”, often in contrast to other possible sources of knowledge such as faith, tradition, or sensory experience. More formally, rationalism is defined as a methodology or a theory &quot;in which the criterion of truth is not sensory but intellectual and deductive&quot;.

In a major philosophical debate during the Enlightenment, rationalism (sometimes here equated with innatism) was opposed to empiricism. On the one hand, rationalists like René Descartes emphasized that knowledge is primarily innate and the intellect, the inner faculty of the human mind, can therefore directly grasp or derive logical truths; on the other hand, empiricists like John Locke emphasized that knowledge is not primarily innate and is best gained by careful observation of the physical world outside the mind, namely through sensory experiences. Rationalists asserted that certain principles exist in logic, mathematics, ethics, and metaphysics that are so fundamentally true that denying them causes one to fall into contradiction. The rationalists had such a high confidence in reason that empirical proof and physical evidence were regarded as unnecessary to ascertain certain truthsin other words, &quot;there are significant ways in which our concepts and knowledge are gained independently of sense experience&quot;.

Different degrees of emphasis on this method or theory lead to a range of rationalist standpoints, from the moderate position &quot;that reason has precedence over other ways of acquiring knowledge&quot; to the more extreme position that reason is &quot;the unique path to knowledge&quot;. Given a pre-modern understanding of reason, rationalism is identical to philosophy, the Socratic life of inquiry, or the zetetic (skeptical) clear interpretation of authority (open to the underlying or essential cause of things as they appear to our sense of certainty).

==Background==

Rationalism has a philosophical history dating from antiquity. The analytical nature of much of philosophical enquiry, the awareness of apparently a priori domains of knowledge such as mathematics, combined with the emphasis of obtaining knowledge through the use of rational faculties (commonly rejecting, for example, direct revelation) have made rationalist themes very prevalent in the history of philosophy.

Since the Enlightenment, rationalism is usually associated with the introduction of mathematical methods into philosophy as seen in the works of Descartes, Leibniz, and Spinoza. This is commonly called continental rationalism, because it was predominant in the continental schools of Europe, whereas in Britain empiricism dominated.

Even then, the distinction between rationalists and empiricists was drawn at a later period and would not have been recognized by the philosophers involved. Also, the distinction between the two philosophies is not as clear-cut as is sometimes suggested; for example, Descartes and Locke have similar views about the nature of human ideas.

Proponents of some varieties of rationalism argue that, starting with foundational basic principles, like the axioms of geometry, one could deductively derive the rest of all possible knowledge. Notable philosophers who held this view most clearly were Baruch Spinoza and Gottfried Leibniz, whose attempts to grapple with the epistemological and metaphysical problems raised by Descartes led to a development of the fundamental approach of rationalism. Both Spinoza and Leibniz asserted that, &quot;in principle&quot;, all knowledge, including scientific knowledge, could be gained through the use of reason alone, though they both observed that this was not possible &quot;in practice&quot; for human beings except in specific areas such as mathematics. On the other hand, Leibniz admitted in his book &quot;Monadology&quot; that &quot;we are all mere Empirics in three fourths of our actions.&quot;

===Political usage===
In politics, rationalism, since the Enlightenment, historically emphasized a &quot;politics of reason&quot; centered upon rationality, deontology, utilitarianism, secularism, and irreligionthe latter aspect&#x27;s antitheism was later softened by the adoption of pluralistic reasoning methods practicable regardless of religious or irreligious ideology. In this regard, the philosopher John Cottingham noted how rationalism, a methodology, became socially conflated with atheism, a worldview:
==Philosophical usage==
Rationalism is often contrasted with empiricism. Taken very broadly, these views are not mutually exclusive, sinceon some definitionsa philosopher can be both rationalist and empiricist. Taken to extremes, the empiricist view holds that all ideas come to us &quot;a posteriori&quot;, that is to say, through experience; either through the external senses or through such inner sensations as pain and gratification. The empiricist essentially believes that knowledge is based on or derived directly from experience. The rationalist believes we come to knowledge &quot;a priori&quot;through the use of logic and is thus independent of sensory experience. In other words, as Galen Strawson once wrote, &quot;you can see that it is true just lying on your couch. You don&#x27;t have to get up off your couch and go outside and examine the way things are in the physical world. You don&#x27;t have to do any science.&quot;

Between both philosophies, the issue at hand is the fundamental source of human knowledge and the proper techniques for verifying what we think we know. Whereas both philosophies are under the umbrella of epistemology, their argument lies in the understanding of the warrant, which is under the wider epistemic umbrella of the theory of justification. Part of epistemology, this theory attempts to understand the justification of propositions and beliefs. Epistemologists are concerned with various epistemic features of belief, which include the ideas of justification, warrant, rationality, and probability. Of these four terms, the term that has been most widely used and discussed by the early 21st century is &quot;warrant&quot;. Loosely speaking, justification is the reason that someone (probably) holds a belief.

If &quot;A&quot; makes a claim and then &quot;B&quot; casts doubt on it, &quot;A&quot;″s next move would normally be to provide justification for the claim. The precise method one uses to provide justification is where the lines are drawn between rationalism and empiricism (among other philosophical views). Much of the debate in these fields are focused on analyzing the nature of knowledge and how it relates to connected notions such as truth, belief, and justification.

At its core, rationalism consists of three basic claims. For people to consider themselves rationalists, they must adopt at least one of these three claims: the intuition/deduction thesis, the innate knowledge thesis, or the innate concept thesis. In addition, a rationalist can choose to adopt the claim of Indispensability of Reason and or the claim of Superiority of Reason, although one can be a rationalist without adopting either thesis.

The indispensability of reason thesis: &quot;The knowledge we gain in subject area, &quot;S&quot;, by intuition and deduction, as well as the ideas and instances of knowledge in &quot;S&quot; that are innate to us, could not have been gained by us through sense experience.&quot; In short, this thesis claims that experience cannot provide what we gain from reason.

The superiority of reason thesis: &#x27;&quot;The knowledge we gain in subject area &quot;S&quot; by intuition and deduction or have innately is superior to any knowledge gained by sense experience&quot;. In other words, this thesis claims reason is superior to experience as a source for knowledge.

Rationalists often adopt similar stances on other aspects of philosophy. Most rationalists reject skepticism for the areas of knowledge they claim are knowable &quot;a priori&quot;. When you claim some truths are innately known to us, one must reject skepticism in relation to those truths. Especially for rationalists who adopt the Intuition/Deduction thesis, the idea of epistemic foundationalism tends to crop up. This is the view that we know some truths without basing our belief in them on any others and that we then use this foundational knowledge to know more truths.

===Intuition/deduction thesis===


Generally speaking, intuition is &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge or experiential belief characterized by its immediacy; a form of rational insight. We simply &quot;see&quot; something in such a way as to give us a warranted belief. Beyond that, the nature of intuition is hotly debated. In the same way, generally speaking, deduction is the process of reasoning from one or more general premises to reach a logically certain conclusion. Using valid arguments, we can deduce from intuited premises.

For example, when we combine both concepts, we can intuit that the number three is prime and that it is greater than two. We then deduce from this knowledge that there is a prime number greater than two. Thus, it can be said that intuition and deduction combined to provide us with &quot;a priori&quot; knowledgewe gained this knowledge independently of sense experience.

To argue in favor of this thesis, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, a prominent German philosopher, says,

Empiricists such as David Hume have been willing to accept this thesis for describing the relationships among our own concepts. In this sense, empiricists argue that we are allowed to intuit and deduce truths from knowledge that has been obtained &quot;a posteriori&quot;.

By injecting different subjects into the Intuition/Deduction thesis, we are able to generate different arguments. Most rationalists agree mathematics is knowable by applying the intuition and deduction. Some go further to include ethical truths into the category of things knowable by intuition and deduction. Furthermore, some rationalists also claim metaphysics is knowable in this thesis. Naturally, the more subjects the rationalists claim to be knowable by the Intuition/Deduction thesis, the more certain they are of their warranted beliefs, and the more strictly they adhere to the infallibility of intuition, the more controversial their truths or claims and the more radical their rationalism.

In addition to different subjects, rationalists sometimes vary the strength of their claims by adjusting their understanding of the warrant. Some rationalists understand warranted beliefs to be beyond even the slightest doubt; others are more conservative and understand the warrant to be belief beyond a reasonable doubt.

Rationalists also have different understanding and claims involving the connection between intuition and truth. Some rationalists claim that intuition is infallible and that anything we intuit to be true is as such. More contemporary rationalists accept that intuition is not always a source of certain knowledgethus allowing for the possibility of a deceiver who might cause the rationalist to intuit a false proposition in the same way a third party could cause the rationalist to have perceptions of nonexistent objects.

===Innate knowledge thesis===
The Innate Knowledge thesis is similar to the Intuition/Deduction thesis in the regard that both theses claim knowledge is gained &quot;a priori&quot;. The two theses go their separate ways when describing how that knowledge is gained. As the name, and the rationale, suggests, the Innate Knowledge thesis claims knowledge is simply part of our rational nature. Experiences can trigger a process that allows this knowledge to come into our consciousness, but the experiences do not provide us with the knowledge itself. The knowledge has been with us since the beginning and the experience simply brought into focus, in the same way a photographer can bring the background of a picture into focus by changing the aperture of the lens. The background was always there, just not in focus.

This thesis targets a problem with the nature of inquiry originally postulated by Plato in &quot;Meno&quot;. Here, Plato asks about inquiry; how do we gain knowledge of a theorem in geometry? We inquire into the matter. Yet, knowledge by inquiry seems impossible. In other words, &quot;If we already have the knowledge, there is no place for inquiry. If we lack the knowledge, we don&#x27;t know what we are seeking and cannot recognize it when we find it. Either way we cannot gain knowledge of the theorem by inquiry. Yet, we do know some theorems.&quot; The Innate Knowledge thesis offers a solution to this paradox. By claiming that knowledge is already with us, either consciously or unconsciously, a rationalist claims we don&#x27;t really learn things in the traditional usage of the word, but rather that we simply use words we know.

===Innate concept thesis===
Similar to the Innate Knowledge thesis, the Innate Concept thesis suggests that some concepts are simply part of our rational nature. These concepts are &quot;a priori&quot; in nature and sense experience is irrelevant to determining the nature of these concepts (though, sense experience can help bring the concepts to our conscious mind).

In his book &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot;, René Descartes postulates three classifications for our ideas when he says, &quot;Among my ideas, some appear to be innate, some to be adventitious, and others to have been invented by me. My understanding of what a thing is, what truth is, and what thought is, seems to derive simply from my own nature. But my hearing a noise, as I do now, or seeing the sun, or feeling the fire, comes from things which are located outside me, or so I have hitherto judged. Lastly, sirens, hippogriffs and the like are my own invention.&quot;

Adventitious ideas are those concepts that we gain through sense experiences, ideas such as the sensation of heat, because they originate from outside sources; transmitting their own likeness rather than something else and something you simply cannot will away. Ideas invented by us, such as those found in mythology, legends and fairy tales, are created by us from other ideas we possess. Lastly, innate ideas, such as our ideas of perfection, are those ideas we have as a result of mental processes that are beyond what experience can directly or indirectly provide.

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz defends the idea of innate concepts by suggesting the mind plays a role in determining the nature of concepts, to explain this, he likens the mind to a block of marble in the &quot;New Essays on Human Understanding&quot;,

Some philosophers, such as John Locke (who is considered one of the most influential thinkers of the Enlightenment and an empiricist), argue that the Innate Knowledge thesis and the Innate Concept thesis are the same. Other philosophers, such as Peter Carruthers, argue that the two theses are distinct from one another. As with the other theses covered under the umbrella of rationalism, the more types and greater number of concepts a philosopher claims to be innate, the more controversial and radical their position; &quot;the more a concept seems removed from experience and the mental operations we can perform on experience the more plausibly it may be claimed to be innate. Since we do not experience perfect triangles but do experience pains, our concept of the former is a more promising candidate for being innate than our concept of the latter.

==History==
===Rationalist philosophy in Western antiquity===

Although rationalism in its modern form post-dates antiquity, philosophers from this time laid down the foundations of rationalism. In particular, the understanding that we may be aware of knowledge available only through the use of rational thought.

====Pythagoras (570–495 BCE)====

Pythagoras was one of the first Western philosophers to stress rationalist insight. He is often revered as a great mathematician, mystic and scientist, but he is best known for the Pythagorean theorem, which bears his name, and for discovering the mathematical relationship between the length of strings on lute and the pitches of the notes. Pythagoras &quot;believed these harmonies reflected the ultimate nature of reality. He summed up the implied metaphysical rationalism in the words &#x27;All is number&#x27;. It is probable that he had caught the rationalist&#x27;s vision, later seen by Galileo (1564–1642), of a world governed throughout by mathematically formulable laws&quot;. It has been said that he was the first man to call himself a philosopher, or lover of wisdom.

====Plato (427–347 BCE)====
Plato held rational insight to a very high standard, as is seen in his works such as Meno and The Republic. He taught on the Theory of Forms (or the Theory of Ideas) which asserts that the highest and most fundamental kind of reality is not the material world of change known to us through sensation, but rather the abstract, non-material (but substantial) world of forms (or ideas). For Plato, these forms were accessible only to reason and not to sense. In fact, it is said that Plato admired reason, especially in geometry, so highly that he had the phrase &quot;Let no one ignorant of geometry enter&quot; inscribed over the door to his academy.

====Aristotle (384–322 BCE)====

Aristotle&#x27;s main contribution to rationalist thinking was the use of syllogistic logic and its use in argument. Aristotle defines syllogism as &quot;a discourse in which certain (specific) things having been supposed, something different from the things supposed results of necessity because these things are so.&quot; Despite this very general definition, Aristotle limits himself to categorical syllogisms which consist of three categorical propositions in his work &quot;Prior Analytics&quot;. These included categorical modal syllogisms.

===Middle Ages===

Although the three great Greek philosophers disagreed with one another on specific points, they all agreed that rational thought could bring to light knowledge that was self-evidentinformation that humans otherwise could not know without the use of reason. After Aristotle&#x27;s death, Western rationalistic thought was generally characterized by its application to theology, such as in the works of Augustine, the Islamic philosopher Avicenna (Ibn Sina), Averroes (Ibn Rushd), and Jewish philosopher and theologian Maimonides. The Waldensians sect also incorporated rationalism into their movement. One notable event in the Western timeline was the philosophy of Thomas Aquinas who attempted to merge Greek rationalism and Christian revelation in the thirteenth-century. Generally, the Roman Catholic Church viewed Rationalists as a threat, labeling them as those who &quot;while admitting revelation, reject from the word of God whatever, in their private judgment, is inconsistent with human reason.&quot;

===Classical rationalism===
====René Descartes (1596–1650)====
Descartes was the first of the modern rationalists and has been dubbed the &#x27;Father of Modern Philosophy.&#x27; Much subsequent Western philosophy is a response to his writings, which are studied closely to this day.

Descartes thought that only knowledge of eternal truthsincluding the truths of mathematics, and the epistemological and metaphysical foundations of the sciences could be attained by reason alone; other knowledge, the knowledge of physics, required experience of the world, aided by the scientific method. He also argued that although dreams appear as real as sense experience, these dreams cannot provide persons with knowledge. Also, since conscious sense experience can be the cause of illusions, then sense experience itself can be doubtable. As a result, Descartes deduced that a rational pursuit of truth should doubt every belief about sensory reality. He elaborated these beliefs in such works as &quot;Discourse on the Method&quot;, &quot;Meditations on First Philosophy&quot;, and &quot;Principles of Philosophy&quot;. Descartes developed a method to attain truths according to which nothing that cannot be recognised by the intellect (or reason) can be classified as knowledge. These truths are gained &quot;without any sensory experience,&quot; according to Descartes. Truths that are attained by reason are broken down into elements that intuition can grasp, which, through a purely deductive process, will result in clear truths about reality.

Descartes therefore argued, as a result of his method, that reason alone determined knowledge, and that this could be done independently of the senses. For instance, his famous dictum, &quot;cogito ergo sum&quot; or &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;, is a conclusion reached &quot;a priori&quot; i.e., prior to any kind of experience on the matter. The simple meaning is that doubting one&#x27;s existence, in and of itself, proves that an &quot;I&quot; exists to do the thinking. In other words, doubting one&#x27;s own doubting is absurd. This was, for Descartes, an irrefutable principle upon which to ground all forms of other knowledge. Descartes posited a metaphysical dualism, distinguishing between the substances of the human body (&quot;&quot;res extensa&quot;) and the mind or soul (&quot;res cogitans&quot;&quot;). This crucial distinction would be left unresolved and lead to what is known as the mind–body problem, since the two substances in the Cartesian system are independent of each other and irreducible.

====Baruch Spinoza (1632–1677)====

The philosophy of Baruch Spinoza is a systematic, logical, rational philosophy developed in seventeenth-century Europe. Spinoza&#x27;s philosophy is a system of ideas constructed upon basic building blocks with an internal consistency with which he tried to answer life&#x27;s major questions and in which he proposed that &quot;God exists only philosophically.&quot; He was heavily influenced by Descartes, Euclid and Thomas Hobbes, as well as theologians in the Jewish philosophical tradition such as Maimonides. But his work was in many respects a departure from the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition. Many of Spinoza&#x27;s ideas continue to vex thinkers today and many of his principles, particularly regarding the emotions, have implications for modern approaches to psychology. To this day, many important thinkers have found Spinoza&#x27;s &quot;geometrical method&quot; difficult to comprehend: Goethe admitted that he found this concept confusing. His &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;Ethics&quot;, contains unresolved obscurities and has a forbidding mathematical structure modeled on Euclid&#x27;s geometry. Spinoza&#x27;s philosophy attracted believers such as Albert Einstein and much intellectual attention.

====Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716)====

Leibniz was the last major figure of seventeenth-century rationalism who contributed heavily to other fields such as metaphysics, epistemology, logic, mathematics, physics, jurisprudence, and the philosophy of religion; he is also considered to be one of the last &quot;universal geniuses&quot;. He did not develop his system, however, independently of these advances. Leibniz rejected Cartesian dualism and denied the existence of a material world. In Leibniz&#x27;s view there are infinitely many simple substances, which he called &quot;monads&quot; (which he derived directly from Proclus).

Leibniz developed his theory of monads in response to both Descartes and Spinoza, because the rejection of their visions forced him to arrive at his own solution. Monads are the fundamental unit of reality, according to Leibniz, constituting both inanimate and animate objects. These units of reality represent the universe, though they are not subject to the laws of causality or space (which he called &quot;well-founded phenomena&quot;). Leibniz, therefore, introduced his principle of pre-established harmony to account for apparent causality in the world.

====Immanuel Kant (1724–1804)====
Kant is one of the central figures of modern philosophy, and set the terms by which all subsequent thinkers have had to grapple. He argued that human perception structures natural laws, and that reason is the source of morality. His thought continues to hold a major influence in contemporary thought, especially in fields such as metaphysics, epistemology, ethics, political philosophy, and aesthetics.

Kant named his brand of epistemology &quot;Transcendental Idealism&quot;, and he first laid out these views in his famous work &quot;The Critique of Pure Reason&quot;. In it he argued that there were fundamental problems with both rationalist and empiricist dogma. To the rationalists he argued, broadly, that pure reason is flawed when it goes beyond its limits and claims to know those things that are necessarily beyond the realm of every possible experience: the existence of God, free will, and the immortality of the human soul. Kant referred to these objects as &quot;The Thing in Itself&quot; and goes on to argue that their status as objects beyond all possible experience by definition means we cannot know them. To the empiricist, he argued that while it is correct that experience is fundamentally necessary for human knowledge, reason is necessary for processing that experience into coherent thought. He therefore concludes that both reason and experience are necessary for human knowledge. In the same way, Kant also argued that it was wrong to regard thought as mere analysis. &quot;In Kant&#x27;s views, a priori concepts do exist, but if they are to lead to the amplification of knowledge, they must be brought into relation with empirical data&quot;.

===Contemporary rationalism===
Rationalism has become a rarer label of philosophers today; rather many different kinds of specialised rationalisms are identified. For example, Robert Brandom has appropriated the terms &quot;rationalist expressivism&quot; and &quot;rationalist pragmatism&quot; as labels for aspects of his programme in &quot;Articulating Reasons&quot;, and identified &quot;linguistic rationalism&quot;, the claim that the contents of propositions &quot;are essentially what can serve as both premises and conclusions of inferences&quot;, as a key thesis of Wilfred Sellars.

Outside of academic philosophy, some participants in the internet communities surrounding LessWrong and Slate Star Codex have described themselves as &quot;rationalists&quot; in reference to rationality, rather than rationalism. The term has also been used in this way by critics such as Timnit Gebru.

==Criticism==
Rationalism was criticized by American psychologist William James for being out of touch with reality. James also criticized rationalism for representing the universe as a closed system, which contrasts with his view that the universe is an open system.

Proponents of emotional choice theory criticize rationalism by drawing on new findings from emotion research in psychology and neuroscience. They point out that the rationalist paradigm is generally based on the assumption that decision-making is a conscious and reflective process based on thoughts and beliefs. It presumes that people decide on the basis of calculation and deliberation. However, cumulative research in neuroscience suggests that only a small part of the brain&#x27;s activities operate at the level of conscious reflection. The vast majority of its activities consist of unconscious appraisals and emotions. The significance of emotions in decision-making has generally been ignored by rationalism, according to these critics. Moreover, emotional choice theorists contend that the rationalist paradigm has difficulty incorporating emotions into its models, because it cannot account for the social nature of emotions. Even though emotions are felt by individuals, psychologists and sociologists have shown that emotions cannot be isolated from the social environment in which they arise. Emotions are inextricably intertwined with people&#x27;s social norms and identities, which are typically outside the scope of standard rationalist accounts. Emotional choice theory seeks to capture not only the social but also the physiological and dynamic character of emotions. It represents a unitary action model to organize, explain, and predict the ways in which emotions shape decision-making.

<text>The  (; &quot;Music of the Ainur&quot;) is the creation account in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium, published posthumously as the first part of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; in 1977. The sets out a central part of the cosmology of Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium, telling how the Ainur, a class of angelic beings, perform a great music prefiguring the creation of the material universe, &quot;Eä&quot;, including Middle-Earth.
The creator Eru Ilúvatar introduces the theme of the sentient races of Elves and Men, not anticipated by the Ainur, and gives physical being to the prefigured universe. Some of the Ainur decide to enter the physical world to prepare for their arrival, becoming the Valar and Maiar.

Tolkien wrote the initial version of the between November 1919 and the spring of 1920 as &quot;Music of the Ainur&quot;, and then completely rewrote it in 1930. He continued to make further revisions throughout his life. The early version was eventually published by his son Christopher in &quot;The Book of Lost Tales 1&quot;.

== Context ==

J. R. R. Tolkien was an English author and philologist of ancient Germanic languages, specialising in Old English, and a devout Roman Catholic; he spent much of his career as a professor at the University of Oxford. He is best known for his novels about his invented Middle-earth, &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. He described &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as &quot;a fundamentally religious and Catholic work&quot;, rich in Christian symbolism. He however spent much of his life working on his Middle-earth legendarium, which was unpublished when he died in 1973. That large body of stories was edited after his death by his son Christopher, initially in 1977 as a single text, &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, containing a version of the . That was followed, between 1983 and 1996, by the twelve volumes of &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot;, which revealed and annotated the many drafts of the overlapping stories of the legendarium, including other versions of the .

== Synopsis ==

The recounts the creation of Arda by the deity Eru Ilúvatar. The story begins with a description of the Ainur as &quot;children of Ilúvatar&#x27;s thought&quot;. They are taught the art of music, which becomes the subject of their immortal lives. The Ainur sing alone or in small groups about themes given to each of them by Ilúvatar, who proposes a &quot;great&quot; plan for them all: a collaborative symphony where they would sing together in harmony. Although the Ainur embody Ilúvatar&#x27;s thoughts, they are expected to use their freedom to assist the development of the &quot;great&quot; plan.

The most powerful of the Ainur, Melkor, is introduced to the music. Although his &quot;loud, and vain&quot; music disrupts the harmony, Ilúvatar stands, smiles and raises his left hand to begin a new theme. When Melkor again spoils the second theme, Ilúvatar rises sternly and raises his right hand to begin a third. Melkor tries to corrupt this theme with the volume of his music, but it is powerful enough to prevent him from succeeding. Ilúvatar ends the music, chastises Melkor and leaves the Ainur to their thoughts.

The deity takes the Ainur to see how music, at the end of the Void, created Arda. When the third theme results in the arrival of the Children of Ilúvatar, the Elves and the Men, many Ainur want to go into the world to visit them. Although Melkor was the first of the Ainur to be named, Ulmo was the first to take action in Arda. Despite Melkor&#x27;s efforts, Ulmo&#x27;s water cannot be ruined by heat or cold; he and Manwë are revealed as the primary agents of Ilúvatar&#x27;s plans.

Some Ainur remain in the Timeless Halls with Ilúvatar, and others go into Arda as the Valar and Maiar. The Ainur begin to prepare for the arrival of the Children of Ilúvatar; Melkor repeatedly thwarts their preparations, desiring to rule Arda. Manwë summons the Ainur to resist Melkor, who retreats. When the Valar later assume bodily form, the first war of Eä begins, but Manwë&#x27;s efforts make the Earth habitable for Elves and Men.

== Writing ==

Tolkien initially intended the (&quot;The Music of the Ainur&quot;) to be part of &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot;, which he wrote in the 1910s and 1920s. In a letter, Tolkien stated that he had written the first version of the between November 1918 and the spring of 1920, while he was working on the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.

The first draft of the story, written in pencil, does not vary significantly from the published version; future changes involved the addition of Manwë and Aulë. The narrator in the earlier version is the elf Rúmil of Tirion and the language differs from that of the &quot;Silmarillion&quot; version. &quot;Melkor&quot; is spelt &quot;Melko&quot;, and Ilúvatar weeps before he creates the third theme. At the end is a section about the Valar, which was later moved to the &quot;Valaquenta&quot;.

Tolkien abandoned the for many years. Although it did not appear in the &quot;Sketch of the Mythology&quot;, in which he summarised his legendarium in 1926, the subject was briefly mentioned in &quot;Annals of Valinor&quot; and &quot;Quenta Silmarillion&quot;. Tolkien rewrote &quot;The Music of the Ainur&quot; during the 1930s, leaving most of its storyline intact.

In 1946, while he was drafting &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Tolkien wrote a new version of the of which only half a torn page survives. His legendarium then changed radically, so that Arda had always existed, the Sun existed when the world was formed, and the Moon was formed as a result of Melkor&#x27;s destruction. Tolkien&#x27;s concept of the Lamps of the Valar was abandoned in favour of a more coherent creation myth, with scientific elements. The idea of a spherical world was abandoned after a reader said that she preferred a flat one.

In 1948 Tolkien began a new version, eliminating mentions of the Sun and the Moon, and introducing the concept that Ilúvatar created the world after the visions of the Ainur died away. In this version, which added several new details, the story is framed by a fictional narrator, the elf Pengoloð.

== Analysis ==

The , written early in Tolkien&#x27;s career, demonstrates the importance of music in his legendarium. According to John Gardner, &quot;Music is the central symbol and the total myth of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, a symbol that becomes interchangeable with light (music&#x27;s projection).&quot; The scholar Verlyn Flieger, too, stresses the pervasive themes of music and light from the creation onwards.

&quot;The Music of the Ainur&quot;, as it appears in &quot;The Book of Lost Tales&quot;, is based on Norse mythology. Like Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; or the &quot;Gylfaginning&quot; in the &quot;Prose Edda&quot;, it answers questions of cosmogony, and its style has been compared to that of old Norse texts. Although the wording differs substantially, the Valar and the Æsir are alike in influencing the world and being influenced by their actions; Manwë has been compared to Odin in this context.

Despite the story&#x27;s Norse pagan elements, such as the Ainur performing the creative work of Ilúvatar, other aspects of the reflect Tolkien&#x27;s Catholicism. His pre-Christian story has been called &quot;Tolkien&#x27;s Genesis essay&quot;; according to another source, &quot;The Biblical parallels evinced by the creation account of the  ... are inescapable.&quot;

The Tolkien scholar Marjorie Burns, who studied the different versions of the , said that Tolkien increasingly Christianised the Valar and reduced the influence of Norse mythology in successive revisions. In the story, Tolkien expresses a global view of Christianity, with good and evil parallelling the stories in the Book of Genesis. As Tolkien has Elrond say in &quot;The Council of Elrond&quot; in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;For nothing is evil in the beginning. Even Sauron was not so.&quot; In the , Ilúvatar creates everything good; evil intrudes later. Though evil is brought about in the creation song by Melkor&#x27;s pride, Ilúvatar incorporates it into the conclusion of his divine plan. The theme of evil being a perversion of good correlates to Christian theology regarding the existence of evil in a world made by a benevolent creator. Even Melkor&#x27;s pride is Eru&#x27;s will. As Eru himself declares &quot;no theme may be played that hath not its uttermost source in me, nor can any alter the music in my despite&quot;.

Although commentary on &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; has primarily focused on the work as a whole, the reaction to the has been generally positive. Joseph Pearce, a Roman Catholic commentator, called it &quot;the most important part of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;&quot; and said, &quot;The myth of creation is perhaps the most significant and most beautiful of Tolkien&#x27;s works.&quot; The scholar of humanities Brian Rosebury considered the a success, with &quot;appropriately &#x27;scriptural&#x27;&quot; prose. Several Jesuits have praised the story; James V. Schall said, &quot;I have never read anything as beautiful as the first page of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;&quot; and Robert Murray said, &quot;In all literature, from the formation of the sacred books of humanity, it is very difficult to find a comparable mythological story of creation by its beauty and imaginative power.&quot;

According to &quot;Fantasy Literature: A Core Collection and Reference Guide&quot;, &quot;Every part of [&quot;The Silmarillion&quot;] benefits from the power and audacity of imaginative genius Tolkien and his brilliant style&quot; and the has &quot;organ tones&quot;. Although Ralph C. Wood called it &quot;one of the finest and most original of [Tolkien&#x27;s] writings&quot;, the stylistic differences between this story and the rest of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; have been the subject of debate.

The American opera singer Adam C. J. Klein composed an opera, &quot;Leithian&quot;, based on &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, while the American contemporary classical composer Frank Felice wrote an orchestral version of the . According to the Tolkien scholar Colin Duriez, the may have inspired C. S. Lewis to have his fictional world of Narnia created from a song.

<text>The Pale (Irish: &quot;An Pháil&quot;) or the English Pale (&#x27; or&#x27;) was the part of Ireland directly under the control of the English government in the Late Middle Ages. It had been reduced by the late 15th century to an area along the east coast stretching north from Dalkey, south of Dublin, to the garrison town of Dundalk. The inland boundary went to Naas and Leixlip around the Earldom of Kildare, towards Trim and north towards Kells. In this district, many townlands have English or Norman-French names, the latter associated with Anglo-Norman influence in England.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;pale&quot;, meaning a fence, is derived from the Latin word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;stake&quot;, specifically a stake used to support a fence. A paling fence is made of pales ganged side by side, and the word &quot;palisade&quot; is derived from the same root. From this came the figurative meaning of &quot;boundary&quot;. The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; is dubious about the popular notion that the phrase &quot;&quot;, as something outside the boundary—i.e., uncivilised, derives from this specific Irish meaning. Also derived from the &quot;boundary&quot; concept was the idea of a pale as an area within which local laws were valid. The term was used not only for the Pale in Ireland but also for various other English overseas settlements, notably English Calais. The term was also used to refer to specific regions in other nations: the term Pale of Settlement was applied to the area in the west of Imperial Russia where Jews were permitted to reside.

==History==

The Pale was a strip of land that stretched north from Dalkey in Dublin to Dundalk in Louth; it became the base of English rule in Ireland. The Norman invasion of Ireland, beginning in 1169, created the Lordship of Ireland and brought Ireland under the theoretical control of the Plantagenet Kings of England. From the 13th century onwards, the Hiberno-Norman occupation in Ireland at first faltered, then waned. Across most of Ireland, the Normans increasingly assimilated into Irish culture after 1300. They made alliances with neighbouring autonomous Gaelic lords. In the long periods when there was no large royal army in Ireland, the Norman lords, like their Gaelic neighbours in the provinces, acted essentially as independent rulers in their own areas.

The Lordship controlled by the English king shrank accordingly, and as parts of its perimeter in counties Meath and Kildare were fenced or ditched, it became known as the Pale, deriving from the Latin word , a stake, or, synecdochically, a fence. Parts can still be seen west of Clane on the grounds of what is now Clongowes Wood College. The military power of the crown itself was greatly weakened by the Hundred Years War (1337–1453), and the Wars of the Roses (1455–85). The Parliament of Ireland was created, often sitting at Drogheda until the Tudors took a greater interest in Irish affairs from 1485 and moved it back to Dublin. The Pale generally consisted of fertile lowlands which were easier for the garrison to defend from ambush than hilly or wooded ground. For reasons of trade and administration, a version of English became the official language. Its closest modern derivative is said to be the accent used by natives of Fingal.

In 1366, so that the English Crown could assert its authority over the settlers, a parliament was assembled in Kilkenny and the Statute of Kilkenny was enacted. The statute decreed that intermarriage between English settlers and Irish natives was forbidden. It also forbade the settlers from using the Irish language and adopting Irish modes of dress or other customs, as such practices were already common. The adoption of Gaelic Brehon property law, in particular, undermined the feudal nature of the Lordship. The Act was never implemented successfully, even in the Pale itself. This inability to enforce the statute indicated that Ireland was withdrawing from English cultural norms.

By the Tudor period, the Irish culture and language had reestablished itself in regions conquered by the Anglo-Normans: &quot;even in the Pale, all the common folk ... for the most part are of Irish birth, Irish habit and of Irish language&quot;. At a higher social level, there was extensive intermarriage between the Gaelic Irish aristocracy and Anglo-Norman lords, beginning not long after the invasion.

By the late 15th century, the Pale became the only part of Ireland that remained subject to the English king, with most of the island paying only token recognition of the overlordship of the English crown. The tax base shrank to a fraction of what it had been in 1300. A proverb quoted by Sir John Davies said that &quot;whoso lives by west of the Barrow, lives west of the law.&quot; The earls of Kildare ruled as lords deputy from 1470 (with more or less success), aided by alliances with the Gaelic lords. This lasted until the 1520s, when the earls passed out of royal favour, but the 9th earl was reinstated in the 1530s. The brief revolt by his son &quot;Silken Thomas&quot; in 1534–35 served in the following decades to hasten the Tudor conquest of Ireland, in which Dublin and the surviving Pale were used as the crown&#x27;s main military base. A book &quot;A Perambulation of Leinster, Meath, and Louth, of which consist the English Pale&quot; (1596) expressed contemporary usage.

The Pale was composed of Dublin and its surrounding area, the population of which was mainly made of Old English merchants who were loyal to the crown.

==Fortification==

The Pale boundary essentially consisted of a fortified ditch and rampart built around parts of the medieval counties of Louth, Meath, Dublin and Kildare, leaving out half of Meath, most of Kildare, and southwest County Dublin. Border or garrison towns of the pale included Ardee, Siddan, Kells, Athboy, Trim, Kilcock, Clane, Naas, Harristown, Ballymore Eustace, Rathmore, Kilteel, Saggart, Tallaght and Dalkey. The northern frontier of the Pale was marked by the De Verdon fortress of Castle Roche, while the southern border lay slightly south of the present day M50 motorway in Dublin, which crosses the site of what was Carrickmines Castle. The following description is from &quot;The Parish of Taney: A History of Dundrum, near Dublin, and Its Neighbourhood&quot; (1895):
In the period immediately after the Norman Settlement was constructed the barrier, known as the &quot;Pale,&quot; separating the lands occupied by the settlers from those remaining in the hands of the Irish. This barrier consisted of a ditch, raised some ten or twelve feet from the ground, with a hedge of thorn on the outer side. It was constructed, not so much to keep out the Irish, as to form an obstacle in their way in their raids on the cattle of the settlers, and thus give time for a rescue. The Pale began at Dalkey, and followed a southwesterly direction towards Kilternan; then turning northwards passed Kilgobbin, where a castle still stands, and crossed the Parish of Taney to the south of that part of the lands of Balally now called Moreen, and thence in a westerly direction to Tallaght, and on to Naas in the County of Kildare. In the wall bounding Moreen is still to be seen a small watch-tower and the remains of a guard-house adjoining it. From this point a beacon-fire would raise the alarm as far as Tallaght, where an important castle stood. A portion of the Pale is still to be seen in Kildare between Clane and Clongowes Wood College at Sallins.
Within the confines of the Pale, the leading gentry and merchants lived lives not too different from those of their counterparts in England, save for the constant fear of attack from the Gaelic Irish.

Portions of the Pale Ditch can still be seen in the Sandyford/Kilgobbin/Ballyogan areas of South Dublin. The most well-preserved section can be visited and lies just south of the Ballyogan Road within the Ballyogan Recycling Park. It consists of pair of ditches on either side of a high flat-topped bank. The bank is 2 to 3 meters wide on the top and is approximately 2 meters above the bottom of the ditches. The entire length of this section is roughly 500 meters and the top of the bank is planted with hedgerow shrubs, indicating that the Pale Ditch subsequently served as a field boundary. Another section of the Pale Ditch lies in the Clay Farm Ecopark, near the Ballyogan Road. This section is very different from the previous section, in that it does not consist of a double ditch and bank. Rather, the builders made use of an existing shallow escarpment, steepening the slope to create a 2 meter high barrier to movement from north to south. The purpose of this was probably to make it hard for Irish raiders to herd stolen cattle from the Pale to the Wicklow mountains to the south. That this feature was part of the Pale Ditch was originally proposed by Rob Goodbody in the 1990s, and recently confirmed by archaeology during the building of the Clay Farm housing development. Both the sections described above are part of a single linear earthwork, designed to connect Kilgobbin and Carrickmines castles, fortifications built by the Walsh Family during the medieval period to defend the southern marches of the Pale. Another, slightly less well-preserved section of the Pale Ditch can be seen at Kilcross Crescent within the Kilcross housing estate near Sandyford village. This section consists of a bank approximately 200 metres long, although the associated ditches are no longer clearly visible.

==End==

The idea of the Pale was inseparable from the notion of a separate Anglo-Irish polity and culture. After the 17th century, and especially after the Anglican Reformation and the Plantation of Ulster, the &quot;Old English&quot; settlers were gradually assimilated into the Irish population. This was in large part due to their relative reluctance to give up Roman Catholicism (those who did not worship in the Church of Ireland bore a variety of legal disabilities). They kept their version of the English language, though by that time many of them also spoke Irish. Several of these men were notable contributors to literature in Irish, including Pierce Ferriter and Geoffrey Keating. Christopher Nugent, 6th Baron Delvin, wrote an Irish-language primer for Elizabeth I.

==Modern usage==
The term continues to be used in contemporary Irish speech to refer to County Dublin and nearby counties, generally critically—for example, a government department may be criticised for concentrating its resources on the Pale.

<text>A solved game is a game whose outcome (win, lose or draw) can be correctly predicted from any position, assuming that both players play perfectly. This concept is usually applied to abstract strategy games, and especially to games with full information and no element of chance; solving such a game may use combinatorial game theory or computer assistance.

==Overview==
A two-player game can be solved on several levels:

===Ultra-weak solution===
: Prove whether the first player will win, lose or draw from the initial position, given perfect play on both sides . This can be a non-constructive proof (possibly involving a strategy-stealing argument) that need not actually determine any details of the perfect play.

===Weak solution===
: Provide an algorithm that secures a win for one player, or a draw for either, against any possible play by the opponent, from the beginning of the game.

===Strong solution===
: Provide an algorithm that can produce perfect play for both players from any position, even if imperfect play has already occurred on one or both sides.

Despite their name, many game theorists believe that &quot;ultra-weak&quot; proofs are the deepest, most interesting and valuable. &quot;Ultra-weak&quot; proofs require a scholar to reason about the abstract properties of the game, and show how these properties lead to certain outcomes if perfect play is realized.

By contrast, &quot;strong&quot; proofs often proceed by brute force—using a computer to exhaustively search a game tree to figure out what would happen if perfect play were realized. The resulting proof gives an optimal strategy for every possible position on the board. However, these proofs are not as helpful in understanding deeper reasons why some games are solvable as a draw, and other, seemingly very similar games are solvable as a win.

Given the rules of any two-person game with a finite number of positions, one can always trivially construct a minimax algorithm that would exhaustively traverse the game tree. However, since for many non-trivial games such an algorithm would require an infeasible amount of time to generate a move in a given position, a game is not considered to be solved weakly or strongly unless the algorithm can be run by existing hardware in a reasonable time. Many algorithms rely on a huge pre-generated database and are effectively nothing more.

As a simple example of a strong solution, the game of tic-tac-toe is easily solvable as a draw for both players with perfect play (a result manually determinable). Games like nim also admit a rigorous analysis using combinatorial game theory.

Whether a game is solved is not necessarily the same as whether it remains interesting for humans to play. Even a strongly solved game can still be interesting if its solution is too complex to be memorized; conversely, a weakly solved game may lose its attraction if the winning strategy is simple enough to remember (e.g., Maharajah and the Sepoys). An ultra-weak solution (e.g., Chomp or Hex on a sufficiently large board) generally does not affect playability.

==Perfect play==

In game theory, perfect play is the behavior or strategy of a player that leads to the best possible outcome for that player regardless of the response by the opponent. Perfect play for a game is known when the game is solved. Based on the rules of a game, every possible final position can be evaluated (as a win, loss or draw). By backward reasoning, one can recursively evaluate a non-final position as identical to the position that is one move away and best valued for the player whose move it is. Thus a transition between positions can never result in a better evaluation for the moving player, and a perfect move in a position would be a transition between positions that are equally evaluated. As an example, a perfect player in a drawn position would always get a draw or win, never a loss. If there are multiple options with the same outcome, perfect play is sometimes considered the fastest method leading to a good result, or the slowest method leading to a bad result.

Perfect play can be generalized to non-perfect information games, as the strategy that would guarantee the highest minimal expected outcome regardless of the strategy of the opponent. As an example, the perfect strategy for rock paper scissors would be to randomly choose each of the options with equal (1/3) probability. The disadvantage in this example is that this strategy will never exploit non-optimal strategies of the opponent, so the expected outcome of this strategy versus any strategy will always be equal to the minimal expected outcome.

Although the optimal strategy of a game may not (yet) be known, a game-playing computer might still benefit from solutions of the game from certain endgame positions (in the form of endgame tablebases), which will allow it to play perfectly after some point in the game. Computer chess programs are well known for doing this.

==Solved games==
; Awari (a game of the Mancala family)
: The variant of Oware allowing game ending &quot;grand slams&quot; was strongly solved by Henri Bal and John Romein at the Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam, Netherlands (2002). Either player can force the game into a draw.
; Chopsticks
: Strongly solved. If two players both play perfectly, the game will go on indefinitely.
; Connect Four
: Solved first by James D. Allen on October 1, 1988, and independently by Victor Allis on October 16, 1988. The first player can force a win. Strongly solved by John Tromp&#x27;s 8-ply database (Feb 4, 1995). Weakly solved for all boardsizes where width+height is at most 15 (as well as 8×8 in late 2015) (Feb 18, 2006). Solved for all boardsizes where width+height equals 16 on May 22, 2024.
; Free gomoku
: Solved by Victor Allis (1993). The first player can force a win without opening rules.
; Ghost
: Solved by Alan Frank using the &quot;Official Scrabble Players Dictionary&quot; in 1987.
; Hexapawn
:3×3 variant solved as a win for black, several other larger variants also solved.
; Kalah
: Most variants solved by Geoffrey Irving, Jeroen Donkers and Jos Uiterwijk (2000) except Kalah (6/6). The (6/6) variant was solved by Anders Carstensen (2011). Strong first-player advantage was proven in most cases.
; L game
: Easily solvable. Either player can force the game into a draw.
; Maharajah and the Sepoys
: This asymmetrical game is a win for the sepoys player with correct play.
; Nim
: Strongly solved.
; Nine men&#x27;s morris
: Solved by Ralph Gasser (1993). Either player can force the game into a draw.
; Order and Chaos
: Order (First player) wins.
; Ohvalhu
: Weakly solved by humans, but proven by computers. (Dakon is, however, not identical to Ohvalhu, the game which actually had been observed by de Voogt)
;Pangki
:Strongly solved by Jason Doucette (2001). The game is a draw. There are only two unique first moves if you discard mirrored positions. One forces the draw, and the other gives the opponent a forced win in 15 moves.
;Pentago
: Strongly solved by Geoffrey Irving with use of a supercomputer at NERSC. The first player wins.
; Quarto
: Solved by Luc Goossens (1998). Two perfect players will always draw. 
; Renju-like game without opening rules involved
: Claimed to be solved by János Wagner and István Virág (2001). A first-player win.
; Teeko
: Solved by Guy Steele (1998). Depending on the variant either a first-player win or a draw.
; Three men&#x27;s morris
: Trivially solvable. Either player can force the game into a draw.
; Three musketeers
: Strongly solved by Johannes Laire in 2009, and weakly solved by Ali Elabridi in 2017. It is a win for the blue pieces (Cardinal Richelieu&#x27;s men, or, the enemy).
; Tic-tac-toe
: Trivially strongly solvable because of the small game tree. The game is a draw if no mistakes are made, with no mistake possible on the opening move.
; Wythoff&#x27;s game
: Strongly solved by W. A. Wythoff in 1907.

==Weak-solves==
; English draughts (checkers)
: This 8×8 variant of draughts was weakly solved on April 29, 2007, by the team of Jonathan Schaeffer. From the standard starting position, both players can guarantee a draw with perfect play. Checkers has a search space of 5×1020 possible game positions. The number of calculations involved was 1014, which were done over a period of 18 years. The process involved from 200 desktop computers at its peak down to around 50.

; Fanorona
: Weakly solved by Maarten Schadd. The game is a draw.

; Losing chess
: Weakly solved in 2016 as a win for White beginning with 1. e3.

;Othello (Reversi)
:Weakly solved in 2023 by Hiroki Takizawa, a researcher at Preferred Networks. From the standard starting position on an 8×8 board, a perfect play by both players will result in a draw. Othello is the largest game solved to date, with a search space of 1028 possible game positions. 

; Pentominoes
: Weakly solved by H. K. Orman. It is a win for the first player.

; Qubic
: Weakly solved by Oren Patashnik (1980) and Victor Allis. The first player wins.

; Sim
: Weakly solved: win for the second player.

;Lambs and tigers
:Weakly solved by Yew Jin Lim (2007). The game is a draw.

==Partially solved games==

; Chess
: Fully solving chess remains elusive, and it is speculated that the complexity of the game may preclude it ever being solved. Through retrograde computer analysis, endgame tablebases (strong solutions) have been found for all three- to seven-piece endgames, counting the two kings as pieces.
: Some variants of chess on a smaller board with reduced numbers of pieces have been solved. Some other popular variants have also been solved; for example, a weak solution to Maharajah and the Sepoys is an easily memorable series of moves that guarantees victory to the &quot;sepoys&quot; player.
; Go
: The 5×5 board was weakly solved for all opening moves in 2002. The 7×7 board was weakly solved in 2015. Humans usually play on a 19×19 board, which is over 145 orders of magnitude more complex than 7×7.
; Hex
: A strategy-stealing argument (as used by John Nash) shows that all square board sizes cannot be lost by the first player. Combined with a proof of the impossibility of a draw, this shows that the game is a first player win (so it is ultra-weak solved). On particular board sizes, more is known: it is strongly solved by several computers for board sizes up to 6×6. Weak solutions are known for board sizes 7×7 (using a swapping strategy), 8×8, and 9×9; in the 8×8 case, a weak solution is known for all opening moves. Strongly solving Hex on an &quot;N&quot;×&quot;N&quot; board is unlikely as the problem has been shown to be PSPACE-complete. If Hex is played on an &quot;N&quot;×(&quot;N&quot; + 1) board then the player who has the shorter distance to connect can always win by a simple pairing strategy, even with the disadvantage of playing second.

; International draughts
: All endgame positions with two through seven pieces were solved, as well as positions with 4×4 and 5×3 pieces where each side had one king or fewer, positions with five men versus four men, positions with five men versus three men and one king, and positions with four men and one king versus four men. The endgame positions were solved in 2007 by Ed Gilbert of the United States. Computer analysis showed that it was highly likely to end in a draw if both players played perfectly.
; &quot;m&quot;,&quot;n&quot;,&quot;k&quot;-game
: It is trivial to show that the second player can never win; see strategy-stealing argument. Almost all cases have been solved weakly for &quot;k&quot; ≤ 4. Some results are known for &quot;k&quot; = 5. The games are drawn for &quot;k&quot; ≥ 8.

<text>Dysentery ( , ), historically known as the bloody flux, is a type of gastroenteritis that results in bloody diarrhea. Other symptoms may include fever, abdominal pain, and a feeling of incomplete defecation. Complications may include dehydration.

The cause of dysentery is usually the bacteria from genus &quot;Shigella&quot;, in which case it is known as shigellosis, or the amoeba &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot;; then it is called amoebiasis. Other causes may include certain chemicals, other bacteria, other protozoa, or parasitic worms. It may spread between people. Risk factors include contamination of food and water with feces due to poor sanitation. The underlying mechanism involves inflammation of the intestine, especially of the colon.

Efforts to prevent dysentery include hand washing and food safety measures while traveling in countries of high risk. While the condition generally resolves on its own within a week, drinking sufficient fluids such as oral rehydration solution is important. Antibiotics such as azithromycin may be used to treat cases associated with travelling in the developing world. While medications used to decrease diarrhea such as loperamide are not recommended on their own, they may be used together with antibiotics.

&quot;Shigella&quot; results in about 165 million cases of diarrhea and 1.1 million deaths a year with nearly all cases in the developing world. In areas with poor sanitation nearly half of cases of diarrhea are due to &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot;. &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot; affects millions of people and results in more than 55,000 deaths a year. It commonly occurs in less developed areas of Central and South America, Africa, and Asia. Dysentery has been described at least since the time of Hippocrates.

== Signs and symptoms ==
The most common form of dysentery is bacillary dysentery, which is typically a mild sickness, causing symptoms normally consisting of mild abdominal pains and frequent passage of loose stools or diarrhea. Symptoms normally present themselves after 1–3 days, and are usually no longer present after a week. The frequency of urges to defecate, the large volume of liquid feces ejected, and the presence of blood, mucus, or pus depends on the pathogen causing the disease. Temporary lactose intolerance can occur, as well. In some occasions, severe abdominal cramps, fever, shock, and delirium can all be symptoms.

In extreme cases, people may pass more than one liter of fluid per hour. More often, individuals will complain of diarrhea with blood, accompanied by extreme abdominal pain, rectal pain and a low-grade fever. Rapid weight loss and muscle aches sometimes also accompany dysentery, while nausea and vomiting are rare.

On rare occasions, the amoebic parasite will invade the body through the bloodstream and spread beyond the intestines. In such cases, it may more seriously infect other organs such as the brain, lungs, and most commonly the liver.

==Cause==

Dysentery results from bacterial or parasitic infections. Viruses do not generally cause the disease. These pathogens typically reach the large intestine after entering orally, through ingestion of contaminated food or water, oral contact with contaminated objects or hands, and so on. Each specific pathogen has its own mechanism or pathogenesis, but in general, the result is damage to the intestinal linings, leading to the inflammatory immune responses. This can cause elevated physical temperature, painful spasms of the intestinal muscles (cramping), swelling due to fluid leaking from capillaries of the intestine (edema) and further tissue damage by the body&#x27;s immune cells and the chemicals, called cytokines, which are released to fight the infection. The result can be impaired nutrient absorption, excessive water and mineral loss through the stools due to breakdown of the control mechanisms in the intestinal tissue that normally remove water from the stools, and in severe cases, the entry of pathogenic organisms into the bloodstream. Anemia may also arise due to the blood loss through diarrhea.

Bacterial infections that cause bloody diarrhea are typically classified as being either invasive or toxogenic. Invasive species cause damage directly by invading into the mucosa. The toxogenic species do not invade, but cause cellular damage by secreting toxins, resulting in bloody diarrhea. This is also in contrast to toxins that cause watery diarrhea, which usually do not cause cellular damage, but rather they take over cellular machinery for a portion of life of the cell.

Definitions of dysentery can vary by region and by medical specialty. The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) limits its definition to &quot;diarrhea with visible blood&quot;. Others define the term more broadly. These differences in definition must be taken into account when defining mechanisms. For example, using the CDC definition requires that intestinal tissue be so severely damaged that blood vessels have ruptured, allowing visible quantities of blood to be lost with defecation. Other definitions require less specific damage.

===Amoebic dysentery===
Amoebiasis, also known as amoebic dysentery, is caused by an infection from the amoeba &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot;, which is found mainly in tropical areas. Proper treatment of the underlying infection of amoebic dysentery is important; insufficiently treated amoebiasis can lie dormant for years and subsequently lead to severe, potentially fatal, complications.

When amoebae inside the bowel of an infected person are ready to leave the body, they group together and form a shell that surrounds and protects them. This group of amoebae is known as a cyst, which is then passed out of the person&#x27;s body in the feces and can survive outside the body. If hygiene standards are poor – for example, if the person does not dispose of the feces hygienically – then it can contaminate the surroundings, such as nearby food and water.
If another person then eats or drinks food or water that has been contaminated with feces containing the cyst, that person will also become infected with the amoebae. Amoebic dysentery is particularly common in parts of the world where human feces are used as fertilizer.
After entering the person&#x27;s body through the mouth, the cyst travels down into the stomach. The amoebae inside the cyst are protected from the stomach&#x27;s digestive acid. From the stomach, the cyst travels to the intestines, where it breaks open and releases the amoebae, causing the infection. The amoebae can burrow into the walls of the intestines and cause small abscesses and ulcers to form. The cycle then begins again.

===Bacillary dysentery===
Dysentery may also be caused by shigellosis, an infection by bacteria of the genus &quot;Shigella&quot;, and is then known as bacillary dysentery (or Marlow syndrome). The term &quot;bacillary dysentery&quot; etymologically might seem to refer to any dysentery caused by any bacilliform bacteria, but its meaning is restricted by convention to &quot;Shigella&quot; dysentery.

===Other bacteria===

Some strains of &quot;Escherichia coli&quot; cause bloody diarrhea. The typical culprits are enterohemorrhagic &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, of which O157:H7 is the best known. These types of &quot;E. coli&quot; also make Shiga toxin.

==Diagnosis==
A diagnosis may be made by taking a history and doing a brief examination. Dysentery should not be confused with hematochezia, which is the passage of fresh blood through the anus, usually in or with stools.

===Physical exam===
The mouth, skin, and lips may appear dry due to dehydration. Lower abdominal tenderness may also be present.

===Stool and blood tests===

Cultures of stool samples are examined to identify the organism causing dysentery. Usually, several samples must be obtained due to the number of amoebae, which changes daily. Blood tests can be used to measure abnormalities in the levels of essential minerals and salts.

==Prevention==
Efforts to prevent dysentery include hand washing and food safety measures while traveling in areas of high risk.

===Vaccine===
Although there is currently no vaccine that protects against &quot;Shigella&quot; infection, several are in development. Vaccination may eventually become a part of the strategy to reduce the incidence and severity of diarrhea, particularly among children in low-resource settings. For example, &quot;Shigella&quot; is a longstanding World Health Organization (WHO) target for vaccine development, and sharp declines in age-specific diarrhea/dysentery attack rates for this pathogen indicate that natural immunity does develop following exposure; thus, vaccination to prevent this disease should be feasible. The development of vaccines against these types of infection has been hampered by technical constraints, insufficient support for coordination, and a lack of market forces for research and development. Most vaccine development efforts are taking place in the public sector or as research programs within biotechnology companies.

== Treatment ==
Dysentery is managed by maintaining fluids using oral rehydration therapy. If this treatment cannot be adequately maintained due to vomiting or the profuseness of diarrhea, hospital admission may be required for intravenous fluid replacement. In ideal situations, no antimicrobial therapy should be administered until microbiological microscopy and culture studies have established the specific infection involved. When laboratory services are not available, it may be necessary to administer a combination of drugs, including an amoebicidal drug to kill the parasite, and an antibiotic to treat any associated bacterial infection. Laudanum (Deodorized Tincture of Opium)] may be used for severe pain and to combat severe diarrhea.

If shigellosis is suspected and it is not too severe, letting it run its course may be reasonable – usually less than a week. If the case is severe, antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin or TMP-SMX may be useful. However, many strains of &quot;Shigella&quot; are becoming resistant to common antibiotics, and effective medications are often in short supply in developing countries. If necessary, a doctor may have to reserve antibiotics for those at highest risk for death, including young children, people over 50, and anyone suffering from dehydration or malnutrition.

Amoebic dysentery is often treated with two antimicrobial drugs such as metronidazole and paromomycin or iodoquinol.

==Prognosis==

With correct treatment, most cases of amoebic and bacterial dysentery subside within 10 days, and most individuals achieve a full recovery within two to four weeks after beginning proper treatment. If the disease is left untreated, the prognosis varies with the immune status of the individual patient and the severity of disease. Extreme dehydration can delay recovery and significantly raises the risk for serious complications including death.

==Epidemiology==

Insufficient data exists, but &quot;Shigella&quot; is estimated to have caused the death of 34,000 children under the age of five in 2013, and 40,000 deaths in people over five years of age. Amoebiasis infects over 50 million people each year, of whom 50,000 die (one per thousand).

==History==
Shigella evolved with the human expansion out of Africa 50,000 to 200,000 years ago.

The seed, leaves, and bark of the kapok tree have been used in traditional medicines by indigenous peoples of the rainforest regions in the Americas, west-central Africa, and Southeast Asia in the treatment of this disease.

In 1915, Australian bacteriologist Fannie Eleanor Williams was serving as a medic in Greece with the Australian Imperial Force, receiving casualties directly from Gallipoli. In Gallipoli, dysentery was severely affecting soldiers and causing significant loss of manpower. Williams carried out serological investigations into dysentery, co-authoring several groundbreaking papers with Sir Charles Martin, director of the Lister Institute. The result of their work into dysentery was increased demand for specific diagnostics and curative sera.

&quot;Bacillus subtilis&quot; was marketed throughout America and Europe from 1946 as an immunostimulatory aid in the treatment of gut and urinary tract diseases such as rotavirus and &quot;Shigella&quot;, but declined in popularity after the introduction of consumer antibiotics.

<text>Uncertainty or incertitude refers to situations involving imperfect or unknown information. It applies to predictions of future events, to physical measurements that are already made, or to the unknown, and is particularly relevant for decision-making. Uncertainty arises in partially observable or stochastic environments, as well as due to ignorance, indolence, or both. It arises in any number of fields, including insurance, philosophy, physics, statistics, economics, finance, medicine, psychology, sociology, engineering, metrology, meteorology, ecology and information science.

==Concepts==
Although the terms are used in various ways among the general public, many specialists in decision theory, statistics and other quantitative fields have defined uncertainty, risk, and their measurement as:

=== Uncertainty ===
The lack of certainty, a state of limited knowledge where it is impossible to exactly describe the existing state, a future outcome, or more than one possible outcome. 

====Measurement====
Uncertainty can be measured through a set of possible states or outcomes where probabilities are assigned to each possible state or outcome – this also includes the application of a probability density function to continuous variables.

==== Second-order uncertainty ====
In statistics and economics, second-order uncertainty is represented in probability density functions over (first-order) probabilities.

Opinions in subjective logic carry this type of uncertainty.

==== Risk ====
Risk is a state of uncertainty, where some possible outcomes have an undesired effect or significant loss. Measurement of risk includes a set of measured uncertainties, where some possible outcomes are losses, and the magnitudes of those losses. This also includes loss functions over continuous variables.

=== Uncertainty versus variability ===
There is a difference between uncertainty and variability. Uncertainty is quantified by a probability distribution which depends upon knowledge about the likelihood of what the single, true value of the uncertain quantity is. Variability is quantified by a distribution of frequencies of multiple instances of the quantity, derived from observed data.

=== Knightian uncertainty ===
In economics, in 1921 Frank Knight distinguished uncertainty from risk with uncertainty being lack of knowledge which is immeasurable and impossible to calculate. Because of the absence of clearly defined statistics in most economic decisions where people face uncertainty, he believed that we cannot measure probabilities in such cases; this is now referred to as Knightian uncertainty.


Knight pointed out that the unfavorable outcome of known risks can be insured during the decision-making process because it has a clearly defined expected probability distribution. Unknown risks have no known expected probability distribution, which can lead to extremely risky company decisions.

Other taxonomies of uncertainties and decisions include a broader sense of uncertainty and how it should be approached from an ethics perspective:


===Risk and uncertainty===
For example, if it is unknown whether or not it will rain tomorrow, then there is a state of uncertainty. If probabilities are applied to the possible outcomes using weather forecasts or even just a calibrated probability assessment, the uncertainty has been quantified. Suppose it is quantified as a 90% chance of sunshine. If there is a major, costly, outdoor event planned for tomorrow then there is a risk since there is a 10% chance of rain, and rain would be undesirable. Furthermore, if this is a business event and $100,000 would be lost if it rains, then the risk has been quantified (a 10% chance of losing $100,000). These situations can be made even more realistic by quantifying light rain vs. heavy rain, the cost of delays vs. outright cancellation, etc.

Some may represent the risk in this example as the &quot;expected opportunity loss&quot; (EOL) or the chance of the loss multiplied by the amount of the loss (10% × $100,000 = $10,000). That is useful if the organizer of the event is &quot;risk neutral&quot;, which most people are not. Most would be willing to pay a premium to avoid the loss. An insurance company, for example, would compute an EOL as a minimum for any insurance coverage, then add onto that other operating costs and profit. Since many people are willing to buy insurance for many reasons, then clearly the EOL alone is not the perceived value of avoiding the risk.

Quantitative uses of the terms &quot;uncertainty&quot; and &quot;risk&quot; are fairly consistent among fields such as probability theory, actuarial science, and information theory. Some also create new terms without substantially changing the definitions of uncertainty or risk. For example, surprisal is a variation on uncertainty sometimes used in information theory. But outside of the more mathematical uses of the term, usage may vary widely. In cognitive psychology, uncertainty can be real, or just a matter of perception, such as expectations, threats, etc.

Vagueness is a form of uncertainty where the analyst is unable to clearly differentiate between two different classes, such as &#x27;person of average height&#x27; and &#x27;tall person&#x27;. This form of vagueness can be modelled by some variation on Zadeh&#x27;s fuzzy logic or subjective logic.

Ambiguity is a form of uncertainty where even the possible outcomes have unclear meanings and interpretations. The statement &quot;He returns from the bank&quot; is ambiguous because its interpretation depends on whether the word &#x27;bank&#x27; is meant as &quot;the side of a river&quot; or &quot;a financial institution&quot;. Ambiguity typically arises in situations where multiple analysts or observers have different interpretations of the same statements.

At the subatomic level, uncertainty may be a fundamental and unavoidable property of the universe. In quantum mechanics, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle puts limits on how much an observer can ever know about the position and velocity of a particle. This may not just be ignorance of potentially obtainable facts but that there is no fact to be found. There is some controversy in physics as to whether such uncertainty is an irreducible property of nature or if there are &quot;hidden variables&quot; that would describe the state of a particle even more exactly than Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle allows.

=== Radical uncertainty ===
The term &#x27;radical uncertainty&#x27; was popularised by John Kay and Mervyn King in their book &quot;Radical Uncertainty: Decision-Making for an Unknowable Future,&quot; published in March 2020. It is distinct from Knightian uncertainty, by whether or not it is &#x27;resolvable&#x27;. If uncertainty arises from a lack of knowledge, and that lack of knowledge is resolvable by acquiring knowledge (such as by primary or secondary research) then it is not radical uncertainty. Only when there are no means available to acquire the knowledge which would resolve the uncertainty, is it considered &#x27;radical&#x27;.

=== In measurements ===

The most commonly used procedure for calculating measurement uncertainty is described in the &quot;Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement&quot; (GUM) published by ISO. A derived work is for example the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Technical Note 1297, &quot;Guidelines for Evaluating and Expressing the Uncertainty of NIST Measurement Results&quot;, and the Eurachem/Citac publication &quot;Quantifying Uncertainty in Analytical Measurement&quot;. The uncertainty of the result of a measurement generally consists of several components. The components are regarded as random variables, and may be grouped into two categories according to the method used to estimate their numerical values:
* Type A, those evaluated by statistical methods
* Type B, those evaluated by other means, e.g., by assigning a probability distribution
By propagating the variances of the components through a function relating the components to the measurement result, the combined measurement uncertainty is given as the square root of the resulting variance. The simplest form is the standard deviation of a repeated observation.

In metrology, physics, and engineering, the uncertainty or margin of error of a measurement, when explicitly stated, is given by a range of values likely to enclose the true value. This may be denoted by error bars on a graph, or by the following notations:
* &quot;measured value&quot; ± &quot;uncertainty&quot;
* &quot;measured value&quot; 
* &quot;measured value&quot; (&quot;uncertainty&quot;)
In the last notation, parentheses are the concise notation for the ± notation. For example, applying 10 meters in a scientific or engineering application, it could be written or , by convention meaning accurate to &quot;within&quot; one tenth of a meter, or one hundredth. The precision is symmetric around the last digit. In this case it&#x27;s half a tenth up and half a tenth down, so 10.5 means between 10.45 and 10.55. Thus it is &quot;understood&quot; that 10.5 means , and 10.50 means , also written and respectively. But if the accuracy is within two tenths, the uncertainty is ± one tenth, and it is &quot;required&quot; to be explicit: and or and . The numbers in parentheses &quot;apply&quot; to the numeral left of themselves, and are not part of that number, but part of a notation of uncertainty. They apply to the least significant digits. For instance, stands for , while stands for . This concise notation is used for example by IUPAC in stating the atomic mass of elements.

The middle notation is used when the error is not symmetrical about the value – for example . This can occur when using a logarithmic scale, for example.

Uncertainty of a measurement can be determined by repeating a measurement to arrive at an estimate of the standard deviation of the values. Then, any single value has an uncertainty equal to the standard deviation. However, if the values are averaged, then the mean measurement value has a much smaller uncertainty, equal to the standard error of the mean, which is the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of measurements. This procedure neglects systematic errors, however.

When the uncertainty represents the standard error of the measurement, then about 68.3% of the time, the true value of the measured quantity falls within the stated uncertainty range. For example, it is likely that for 31.7% of the atomic mass values given on the list of elements by atomic mass, the true value lies outside of the stated range. If the width of the interval is doubled, then probably only 4.6% of the true values lie outside the doubled interval, and if the width is tripled, probably only 0.3% lie outside. These values follow from the properties of the normal distribution, and they apply only if the measurement process produces normally distributed errors. In that case, the quoted standard errors are easily converted to 68.3% (&quot;one sigma&quot;), 95.4% (&quot;two sigma&quot;), or 99.7% (&quot;three sigma&quot;) confidence intervals.

In this context, uncertainty depends on both the accuracy and precision of the measurement instrument. The lower the accuracy and precision of an instrument, the larger the measurement uncertainty is. Precision is often determined as the standard deviation of the repeated measures of a given value, namely using the same method described above to assess measurement uncertainty. However, this method is correct only when the instrument is accurate. When it is inaccurate, the uncertainty is larger than the standard deviation of the repeated measures, and it appears evident that the uncertainty does not depend only on instrumental precision.

==In the media==
Uncertainty in science, and science in general, may be interpreted differently in the public sphere than in the scientific community. This is due in part to the diversity of the public audience, and the tendency for scientists to misunderstand lay audiences and therefore not communicate ideas clearly and effectively. One example is explained by the information deficit model. Also, in the public realm, there are often many scientific voices giving input on a single topic. For example, depending on how an issue is reported in the public sphere, discrepancies between outcomes of multiple scientific studies due to methodological differences could be interpreted by the public as a lack of consensus in a situation where a consensus does in fact exist. This interpretation may have even been intentionally promoted, as scientific uncertainty may be managed to reach certain goals. For example, climate change deniers took the advice of Frank Luntz to frame global warming as an issue of scientific uncertainty, which was a precursor to the conflict frame used by journalists when reporting the issue.

&quot;Indeterminacy can be loosely said to apply to situations in which not all the parameters of the system and their interactions are fully known, whereas ignorance refers to situations in which it is not known what is not known.&quot; These unknowns, indeterminacy and ignorance, that exist in science are often &quot;transformed&quot; into uncertainty when reported to the public in order to make issues more manageable, since scientific indeterminacy and ignorance are difficult concepts for scientists to convey without losing credibility. Conversely, uncertainty is often interpreted by the public as ignorance. The transformation of indeterminacy and ignorance into uncertainty may be related to the public&#x27;s misinterpretation of uncertainty as ignorance.

Journalists may inflate uncertainty (making the science seem more uncertain than it really is) or downplay uncertainty (making the science seem more certain than it really is). One way that journalists inflate uncertainty is by describing new research that contradicts past research without providing context for the change. Journalists may give scientists with minority views equal weight as scientists with majority views, without adequately describing or explaining the state of scientific consensus on the issue. In the same vein, journalists may give non-scientists the same amount of attention and importance as scientists.

Journalists may downplay uncertainty by eliminating &quot;scientists&#x27; carefully chosen tentative wording, and by losing these caveats the information is skewed and presented as more certain and conclusive than it really is&quot;. Also, stories with a single source or without any context of previous research mean that the subject at hand is presented as more definitive and certain than it is in reality. There is often a &quot;product over process&quot; approach to science journalism that aids, too, in the downplaying of uncertainty. Finally, and most notably for this investigation, when science is framed by journalists as a triumphant quest, uncertainty is erroneously framed as &quot;reducible and resolvable&quot;.

Some media routines and organizational factors affect the overstatement of uncertainty; other media routines and organizational factors help inflate the certainty of an issue. Because the general public (in the United States) generally trusts scientists, when science stories are covered without alarm-raising cues from special interest organizations (religious groups, environmental organizations, political factions, etc.) they are often covered in a business related sense, in an economic-development frame or a social progress frame. The nature of these frames is to downplay or eliminate uncertainty, so when economic and scientific promise are focused on early in the issue cycle, as has happened with coverage of plant biotechnology and nanotechnology in the United States, the matter in question seems more definitive and certain.

Sometimes, stockholders, owners, or advertising will pressure a media organization to promote the business aspects of a scientific issue, and therefore any uncertainty claims which may compromise the business interests are downplayed or eliminated.

==Applications==
* Uncertainty is designed into games, most notably in gambling, where chance is central to play.
* In scientific modelling, in which the prediction of future events should be understood to have a range of expected values
* In computer science, and in particular data management, uncertain data is commonplace and can be modeled and stored within an uncertain database
* In optimization, uncertainty permits one to describe situations where the user does not have full control on the outcome of the optimization procedure, see scenario optimization and stochastic optimization.
* In weather forecasting, it is now commonplace to include data on the degree of uncertainty in a weather forecast.
* Uncertainty or error is used in science and engineering notation. Numerical values should only have to be expressed in those digits that are physically meaningful, which are referred to as significant figures. Uncertainty is involved in every measurement, such as measuring a distance, a temperature, etc., the degree depending upon the instrument or technique used to make the measurement. Similarly, uncertainty is propagated through calculations so that the calculated value has some degree of uncertainty depending upon the uncertainties of the measured values and the equation used in the calculation.
* In physics, the Heisenberg uncertainty principle forms the basis of modern quantum mechanics.
* In metrology, measurement uncertainty is a central concept quantifying the dispersion one may reasonably attribute to a measurement result. Such an uncertainty can also be referred to as a measurement error. 
* In daily life, measurement uncertainty is often implicit (&quot;He is 6 feet tall&quot; give or take a few inches), while for any serious use an explicit statement of the measurement uncertainty is necessary. The expected measurement uncertainty of many measuring instruments (scales, oscilloscopes, force gages, rulers, thermometers, etc.) is often stated in the manufacturers&#x27; specifications.
* In engineering, uncertainty can be used in the context of validation and verification of material modeling.
* Uncertainty has been a common theme in art, both as a thematic device (see, for example, the indecision of Hamlet), and as a quandary for the artist (such as Martin Creed&#x27;s difficulty with deciding what artworks to make).
* Uncertainty is an important factor in economics. According to economist Frank Knight, it is different from risk, where there is a specific probability assigned to each outcome (as when flipping a fair coin). Knightian uncertainty involves a situation that has unknown probabilities.
* Investing in financial markets such as the stock market involves Knightian uncertainty when the probability of a rare but catastrophic event is unknown.

==Philosophy==

In Western philosophy the first philosopher to embrace uncertainty was Pyrrho resulting in the Hellenistic philosophies of Pyrrhonism and Academic Skepticism, the first schools of philosophical skepticism. Aporia and acatalepsy represent key concepts in ancient Greek philosophy regarding uncertainty.

William MacAskill, a philosopher at Oxford University, has also discussed the concept of Moral Uncertainty. Moral Uncertainty is &quot;uncertainty about how to act given lack of certainty in any one moral theory, as well as the study of how we ought to act given this uncertainty.&quot;

That would mean taking much bigger and more transformative steps: all but eliminating fossil fuels... and prioritizing democratic institutions over markets. The burden of this effort must fall almost entirely on the richest people and richest parts of the world, because it is they who continue to gamble with everyone else&#x27;s fate.&quot; (p. 19.)

<text>The Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) was an Ulster loyalist paramilitary group in Northern Ireland. It was formed by Billy Wright in 1996 when he and his unit split from the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) after breaking its ceasefire. Most of its members came from the UVF&#x27;s Mid-Ulster Brigade, which Wright had commanded. 

In a two-year period from August 1996, the LVF waged a paramilitary campaign in opposition to Irish republicanism and the Northern Ireland peace process. During this time it killed at least 14 people in gun and bomb attacks, almost all of them Catholic civilians killed at random. The LVF called off its campaign in August 1998 and decommissioned some of its weapons, but in the early 2000s a loyalist feud led to several killings. 

Since then, the LVF has been largely inactive, but its members are believed to have been involved in rioting and organized crime. In 2015, the security forces stated that the LVF &quot;exists only as a criminal group&quot; in Mid-Ulster and Antrim.

The LVF is designated a terrorist group by the United Kingdom and United States.

==Goals==
In a document, the LVF outlined its goals as follows:

*The use of the Ulster conflict as a crucible for far-reaching, fundamental and decisive change in the United Kingdom constitution. 
*To restore Ulster&#x27;s right to self-determination. 
*To end Irish nationalist aggression against Ulster in whatever form.
*To end all forms of Irish interference in Ulster&#x27;s internal affairs.
*To thwart the creation and/or implementation of any All-Ireland/All-Island political super-structure regardless of the powers vested in such institutions.
*To defeat the campaign of de-Britishisation and Gaelicisation of Ulster&#x27;s daily life.

There is also a Christian fundamentalist element within the LVF. 

Its leader, Billy Wright, was a born again Christian and former preacher. Professor Peter Shirlow, of Queen&#x27;s University Belfast, noted that many LVF members believed that Irish nationalism/republicanism and Catholicism were interlinked. They believed that Ulster Protestants were a persecuted people and Ulster was their &quot;God-given land&quot;, which must be defended from these &quot;dark and satanic forces&quot;.

The LVF published a magazine called &quot;Leading the Way&quot;.

==History==

===Early days===
Billy Wright was the leader of the Mid-Ulster Brigade of the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF), having taken over the command from Robin &quot;the Jackal&quot; Jackson in the early 1990s upon the latter&#x27;s retirement. In October 1994, the UVF and other loyalist paramilitary groups called a ceasefire. 

Internal differences between Wright and the UVF&#x27;s Brigade Staff in Belfast came to a head in July 1996, during the Drumcree parade dispute. The Orange Order was being stopped from marching through the Catholic Garvaghy area of Portadown. There was a standoff at Drumcree Church between thousands of Orangemen and their supporters on one side, and the security forces on the other. Wright was angered that the march was being blocked, and was often seen at Drumcree with Harold Gracey, head of the Portadown Orange Lodge.

Wright&#x27;s brigade smuggled homemade weaponry to Drumcree, apparently unhindered by the Orangemen. On 7 July, a day into the standoff, members of Wright&#x27;s brigade shot dead Catholic taxi driver Michael McGoldrick near Aghagallon. The man who killed McGoldrick said he had also planned, along with Billy Wright and Mark Fulton, to kidnap three priests from a parochial house in County Armagh and shoot them unless the march was allowed to continue. Allegedly, the brigade also planned to drive petrol tankers into the Catholic area and blow them up. After four days of loyalist protests and violence throughout Northern Ireland, the police reversed their decision and allowed the march to continue.

For breaking the ceasefire, Wright and the Portadown unit of the Mid-Ulster Brigade were &quot;stood down&quot; by the UVF leadership on 2 August 1996. 

Wright and his unit left the UVF and formed the Looyalist Volunteer Force (LVF). He personally chose its codename of &quot;Covenant&quot;, which was used to claim LVF attacks.
Although behind many attacks in the Mid-Ulster area, especially in Portadown and Lurgan, Wright was arrested in January 1997 on charges of issuing death threats and perverting the course of justice. He was convicted in March 1997 and sentenced to eight years in the Maze Prison. There he demanded a separate wing for LVF prisoners. The authorities agreed and the wing became a gathering point for loyalists opposed to the Northern Ireland peace process, including many men from Belfast and north Down.

===Death of Billy Wright===
On 27 December 1997, Wright was assassinated by Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) prisoners inside the Maze Prison: Christopher &quot;Crip&quot; McWilliams, John Glennon and John Kennaway. The three were imprisoned in the same block as Wright. He was shot as he travelled in a prison van. After killing Wright, the three surrendered to prison guards. They also delivered a statement: &quot;Billy Wright was executed [...] for directing and waging his campaign of terror against the nationalist people from his prison cell&quot;.

That night, LVF gunmen opened fire on the dance hall of the Glengannon Hotel, near Dungannon. The hotel was owned by Catholics and about 400 teenagers were attending a disco there. Three civilians were wounded and one, a former Provisional IRA volunteer, was killed. Police believed that the disco was the intended target, rather than the ex-volunteer. Witnesses said it was &quot;an attempt at mass-murder&quot;.

Some believed that prison authorities colluded with the INLA in Wright&#x27;s killing. The INLA strongly denied these rumours. It published a detailed account of the assassination in the March/April 1999 issue of &quot;The Starry Plough&quot; newspaper.

===Good Friday Agreement and ceasefire===
In March 1998, during the negotiations for the Good Friday Agreement, the LVF issued a statement backing the anti-agreement Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), saying the party&#x27;s leader, Ian Paisley, had got it &quot;absolutely right&quot;. DUP Member of Parliament Willie McCrea appeared on public platforms with LVF leaders.

In May 1998 the LVF called a ceasefire and urged people to vote &#x27;No&#x27; in the referendum on the Agreement. The Northern Ireland Office accepted its ceasefire in November, making LVF prisoners eligible for early release under the Agreement. Later, it handed over a small amount of weapons to the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning. The decommissioned weapons were as follows:
*4 sub-machine guns
*2 rifles
*2 pistols
*1 sawn-off shotgun
*2 pipe bombs
*various ammunition and detonators

The destruction of some of the LVF arms were recorded by video. However, since the weapons were decommissioned in mid-1998, the LVF has killed four people. 

===Post-ceasefire activities===
In early 2000, an LVF-UVF feud began, and there were several tit-for-tat killings. The Secretary of State declared on 12 October 2001 that the government no longer recognised their ceasefire.

After its ceasefire, the LVF continued supporting the Orangemen in their protests at Drumcree. In July 2000, it was revealed that members of neo-Nazi group Combat 18 were travelling from England to join the protest. They were given shelter by LVF volunteers in Portadown and Tandragee. Combat 18 had opposed the LVF&#x27;s ceasefire, but this trip was said to mark a &quot;healing of the rift&quot;.

In 2002, Wright&#x27;s successor as LVF leader, Mark Fulton, was found hanged in Maghaberry prison. It is believed that he committed suicide.

In July 2005 the IRA declared it had ended its armed campaign and would disarm. In September 2005 weapons inspectors declared that the IRA had fully disarmed. In response, on 30 October that year, the LVF stated that it was standing down.

In February 2006, the Independent Monitoring Commission confirmed that the LVF-UVF feud was over. But, it said that the LVF&#x27;s involvement with organised crime and drug trafficking continued, describing it as a &quot;deeply criminal organisation&quot;. The twentieth IMC report stated that the group was small and without political purpose. Most of its violence was &quot;more criminal than paramilitary&quot; in nature. LVF members who continued violent activity were said to do so &quot;for personal gain&quot; and associated with the organisation at large only when it was helpful to do so. The report added that simple aggressive police work could damage the group&#x27;s continuance.

==Timeline of attacks==
According to the Conflict Archive on the Internet&#x27;s Sutton Database, the LVF have killed 19 people, who included:
*14 civilians (12 Catholics and 2 Protestants)
*3 UVF members
*1 former Provisional IRA member
*1 of its own members

Two further killings of Catholics were claimed by the LVF, but the RUC believed that UDA members were responsible.

The following is a timeline of attacks and attempted attacks that have been claimed by, or blamed on, the LVF.

===1996===
* 7 July: in Aghagallon, the LVF shot dead Catholic taxi driver Michael McGoldrick (31) in his car. The gunmen then set it on fire. This attack was believed to be related to the Drumcree conflict; at the time, the Orange Order was being stopped from marching through the Catholic area of Portadown in their annual &#x27;celebration&#x27;. Members of the group smuggled home-made weaponry to the protests at Drumcree church, apparently unhindered by the Orangemen.
* 10 July: The LVF was responsible for hijacking a postal van and planting a hoax bomb during rioting in Portadown.
* 25 October: LVF members carried out a failed armed robbery at the home of an Ulster Bank manager in Newcastle County Down.

===1997===
* 3 January: three men (James Buchanan, Jonathan Birney and Andrew Doran) accused of drug dealing by the UDA were kneecapped by members of the LVF. This was apparently an effort to punish them but prevent them being killed by other loyalist paramilitaries.
* 6 January: The LVF shot and injured a man in the Glandore Terrace estate, Portadown. UDA member Derek Wray had been the original intended target.
* 20 January: the LVF was believed to be behind a bomb that exploded under a van owned by a Catholic in Larne, County Antrim.
* 8 March: the LVF carried out firebomb attacks on Northern Ireland Tourist Board (NITB) offices in Banbridge and Newcastle, County Down. The attacks were believed to be a response to the NITB&#x27;s marketing of the whole of Ireland as a tourist destination together with Bord Fáilte (the tourist board of the Republic of Ireland).
*1 April: Mountpottinger Baptist Tabernacle, a Protestant church in East Belfast, was damaged in an arson attack. Although DUP press officer Sammy Wilson blamed Catholics, on 20 April Progressive Unionist Party leader David Ervine asserted it was an LVF attempt to raise sectarian tension.
* 27 April: Robert Hamill (25), a Catholic civilian, was kicked to death by a loyalist mob in Portadown town centre while walking home. Police parked nearby did not intervene. The six men charged with his murder were placed in the LVF wing of the Maze Prison at their own request.
* 12 May: the LVF kidnapped Catholic civilian Seán Brown (61) after he left the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) club in Bellaghy, County Londonderry. He was beaten and shot dead; his body was found the next day by a burnt-out car on Moneynick Road near Randalstown.
* 14 May: the LVF was alleged to have tried to kill a Catholic taxi driver in Milford, County Armagh. He escaped when the gunman&#x27;s weapon jammed.
* 24 May: the LVF claimed responsibility for planting a bomb in Dundalk, County Louth, Republic of Ireland. The time bomb was planted in an alleyway on Clanbrassil Street, the town&#x27;s main shopping street. However, after it partially exploded, it was defused by Gardaí (the Republic&#x27;s police). The LVF warned that further &quot;no-warning bomb attacks&quot; would take place &quot;as long as Dublin interferes in Ulster affairs&quot;.
* 2 July: the LVF threatened to kill Catholic civilians if an upcoming Orange march was banned from the Garvaghy Road in Portadown.
* 15 July: the LVF killed Catholic civilian Bernadette Martin (18) in Aghalee. She was shot four times in the head as she slept in her Protestant boyfriend&#x27;s home.
* 24 July: the LVF kidnapped Catholic civilian James Morgan (16) in Newcastle, County Down. He was tortured, beaten to death with a hammer, and his body was doused in petrol and set alight. His burnt and mutilated body was found three days later in a waterlogged ditch used for the disposal of animal carcasses near Clough. Norman Coopey was charged and convicted of the killing.
* 5 August: the LVF claimed responsibility for trying to kill a Catholic taxi driver in Lurgan. He escaped when the gun jammed.
* 12 August: twenty-seven LVF prisoners in the Maze Prison began a riot which caused severe damage to C and D wings of H-Block 6.
* 13-14 August: the LVF was blamed for attacks on the homes of four serving and former prison officers in Mid-Ulster.
* 17 November: the LVF claimed responsibility for planting four small bombs in Dundalk, Republic of Ireland, which were removed by police.
* 5 December: the LVF shot dead Catholic civilian Gerry Devlin (36) outside a GAA club in Glengormley, County Antrim.
* 27 December: the LVF launched a gun attack on the dance hall of the Catholic-owned Glengannon Hotel near Dungannon, County Tyrone. Hundreds of teenagers were attending a disco inside when gunmen fired on a crowd of people at the entrance. A doorman, Catholic civilian Seamus Dillon (45), was killed and three other people were wounded. This was believed to be revenge for the killing of Billy Wright in HM Maze prison earlier that day. The LVF said: &quot;This attack and future attacks lay squarely at the feet of republicans. For too long the Protestant people have watched their very faith, culture and identity being slowly eroded away&quot;.
* 31 December: the LVF claimed responsibility for a gun attack on the Clifton Tavern on Cliftonville Road, Belfast. Gunmen burst into the pub and sprayed it with gunfire. Catholic civilian Eddie Treanor (31) was killed and five others were wounded. The RUC believed that UDA members were involved.

===1998===

*10 January: the LVF launched a gun attack on the Space nightclub at Talbot Street, Belfast. Gunmen pulled up in a car and opened fire on people standing at the door. A doorman, Catholic civilian Terry Enright (28), was killed. He was a cross-community worker who helped steer young people away from violence. The LVF said it was revenge for the killing of Billy Wright by INLA.
*18 January: the LVF killed Catholic civilian Fergal McCusker (28) in Maghera, County Londonderry. He was kidnapped and shot dead while walking home. His body was found behind a youth center off Tircane Road.
*19 January: the LVF claimed responsibility for shooting dead Catholic taxi driver Larry Brennan (52) as he sat in his car on Ormeau Road, Belfast. The attack happened hours after the INLA killed UDA member Jim Guiney. Police believe UDA members were involved.
*23 January: the LVF shot dead Catholic construction worker Liam Conway (39) as he operated a digger on Hesketh Road, Belfast.
*24 January: the LVF shot dead Catholic taxi driver John McColgan (33) in Belfast. He had picked up a number of men on the Andersonstown Road, who told him to drive to Upper Glen Road. They shot him, dumped his body by the roadside, and drove off in the taxi.
*25 January: the LVF claimed responsibility for shooting and wounding a Catholic civilian in Lurgan. The man was sitting in the cab of a lorry when a lone gunman shot at him several times.
*27 January: the LVF was blamed for trying to kill a Catholic taxi driver in North Belfast. He escaped when the gun jammed.
*27 January: the Northern Ireland Council for Voluntary Action (NICVA) announced that the LVF had issued death threats against a number of Catholic cross-community workers in the Mid-Ulster area.
*4 February: the LVF admitted firing a shot at a Protestant man in Lurgan and warned him to leave the area.
*23 February: the LVF claimed responsibility for planting a small car bomb outside a Garda station in Dromad, County Louth, Republic of Ireland. It was spotted and defused by the security forces. The LVF threatened further attacks in the Republic.

*3 March: the LVF killed a Catholic and a Protestant civilian—Damian Trainor (26) and Philip Allen (34)—in the Railway Bar in Poyntzpass, County Armagh. Gunmen entered the Catholic-owned pub, told them to lie on the floor and then shot them dead. The two were close friends.
*5 March: the LVF was blamed for a gun attack on a house in a mainly-Protestant area of Antrim. A Catholic man and his Protestant wife lived there. She and her daughter were wounded.
*8 March: the LVF issued threats against Protestant churchmen, business leaders and politicians who it claimed were &quot;colluding&quot; with the peace process.
*17 March: the LVF claimed responsibility for an attempted bomb attack on St Comgall&#x27;s parish centre in Larne. The building was packed with people celebrating Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day when two men threw a bomb through the door. The bomb failed to explode and was defused.
*21 April: the LVF killed Catholic civilian Adrian Lamph (29) in Portadown. A gunman cycled into his workplace—the Fairgreen amenity site on Duke Street—then singled him out and shot him. He was the first victim of the conflict since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.
*25 April: the LVF shot dead a Catholic civilian, Ciaran Heffron (22), as he walked home in Crumlin, County Antrim. Meanwhile, 25 civilians escaped injury when a bomb was thrown into a Catholic-owned pub and restaurant at Aghinlig, County Armagh.
*15 May: the LVF announced an &quot;unequivocal ceasefire&quot; which it hoped would encourage people to vote against the Good Friday Agreement.
*2 July: the LVF was blamed for setting fire to ten Catholic churches in Northern Ireland. Churches were burnt over a ten-hour period in Crumlin, Lisburn, Dromore, Castlewellan, Banbridge, Laurencetown, Tandragee and Dungannon.

<text>A sporangium (from Late Latin, ); : sporangia) is an enclosure in which spores are formed. It can be composed of a single cell or can be multicellular. Virtually all plants, fungi, and many other groups form sporangia at some point in their life cycle. Sporangia can produce spores by mitosis, but in land plants and many fungi, sporangia produce genetically distinct haploid spores by meiosis.

==Fungi==
In some phyla of fungi, the sporangium plays a role in asexual reproduction, and may play an indirect role in sexual reproduction. The sporangium forms on the sporangiophore and contains haploid nuclei and cytoplasm. Spores are formed in the sporangiophore by encasing each haploid nucleus and cytoplasm in a tough outer membrane. During asexual reproduction, these spores are dispersed via wind and germinate into haploid hyphae. 

Although sexual reproduction in fungi varies between phyla, for some fungi the sporangium plays an indirect role in sexual reproduction. For Zygomycota, sexual reproduction occurs when the haploid hyphae from two individuals join to form a zygosporangium in response to unfavorable conditions. The haploid nuclei within the zygosporangium then fuse into diploid nuclei. When conditions improve, the zygosporangium germinates, undergoes meiosis and produces a sporangium, which releases spores.

==Land plants==
In mosses, liverworts and hornworts, an unbranched sporophyte produces a single sporangium, which may be quite complex morphologically. Most non-vascular plants, as well as many lycophytes and most ferns, are homosporous (only one kind of spore is produced). Some lycophytes, such as the Selaginellaceae and Isoetaceae, the extinct Lepidodendrales, and ferns, such as the Marsileaceae and Salviniaceae are heterosporous (two kinds of spores are produced). These plants produce both microspores and megaspores, which give rise to gametophytes that are functionally male or female, respectively. Most heterosporous plants there are two kinds of sporangia, termed microsporangia and megasporangia.

Sporangia can be terminal (on the tips) or lateral (placed along the side) of stems or associated with leaves. In ferns, sporangia are typically found on the surface (underside) of the leaf and are densely aggregated into clusters called sori. Sori may be covered by a structure called an indusium. Some ferns have their sporangia scattered along reduced leaf segments or along (or just in from) the margin of the leaf. Lycophytes, in contrast, bear their sporangia on the surface (the upper side) of leaves or laterally on stems. Leaves that bear sporangia are called sporophylls. If the plant is heterosporous, the sporangia-bearing leaves are distinguished as either microsporophylls or megasporophylls. In seed plants, sporangia are typically located within strobili or flowers.

Cycads form their microsporangia on microsporophylls which are aggregated into strobili. Megasporangia are formed into ovules, which are borne on megasporophylls, which are aggregated into strobili on separate plants (all cycads are dioecious). Conifers typically bear their microsporangia on microsporophylls aggregated into papery pollen strobili, and the ovules, are located on modified stem axes forming compound ovuliferous cone scales. Flowering plants contain microsporangia in the anthers of stamens (typically four microsporangia per anther) and megasporangia inside ovules inside ovaries. In all seed plants, spores are produced by meiosis and develop into gametophytes while still inside the sporangium. The microspores become microgametophytes (pollen). The megaspores become megagametophytes (embryo sacs).

===Eusporangia and leptosporangia===
Categorized based on developmental sequence, eusporangia and leptosporangia are differentiated in the vascular plants.
* In a leptosporangium, found only in leptosporangiate ferns, development involves a single initial cell that becomes the stalk, wall, and spores within the sporangium. There are around 64 spores in a leptosporangium.

* In a eusporangium, characteristic of all other vascular plants and some primitive ferns, the initials are in a layer (i.e., more than one). A eusporangium is larger (hence contain more spores), and its wall is multi-layered. Although the wall may be stretched and damaged, resulting in only one cell-layer remaining.

===Synangium===
A cluster of sporangia that have become fused in development is called a synangium (pl. synangia). This structure is most prominent in &quot;Psilotum&quot; and Marattiaceae such as &quot;Christensenia&quot;, &quot;Danaea&quot; and &quot;Marattia&quot;.

==Internal structures==
A columella (pl. columellae) is a sterile (non-reproductive) structure that extends into and supports the sporangium of some species. In fungi, the columella, which may be branched or unbranched, may be of fungal or host origin. &quot;Secotium&quot; species have a simple, unbranched columella, while in &quot;Gymnoglossum&quot; species, the columella is branched. In some &quot;Geastrum&quot; species, the columella appears as an extension of the stalk into the spore mass (gleba).

<doc id="63785" wikidata="Q2869400" url="?curid=63785" title="Atlantic League of Professional Baseball">
<text>The Atlantic League of Professional Baseball (ALPB) is a professional independent baseball league based in the United States. It is an official MLB Partner League based in the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern United States, and the headquarters are located at Penn Medicine Park in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

The Atlantic League operates in cities not served by Major League Baseball (MLB) or Minor League Baseball (MiLB) teams; most of its teams are within suburbs and exurbs too close to other teams in the organized baseball system to have minor league franchises of their own. The Atlantic League requires cities to have the market for a 4,000 to 7,500-seat ballpark and for the facility to be maintained at or above Triple-A standards. When Atlantic League professionals are signed by MLB clubs, they usually start in their Double-A or Triple-A affiliates.

The league uses a pitch clock and limits the time between innings in an effort to speed up the game. In 2019, the Atlantic League began a three-year partnership with Major League Baseball allowing MLB to implement changes to Atlantic League playing rules, in order to observe the effects of potential future rule changes and equipment. In 2020, the Atlantic League, together with the American Association, the Frontier League, and the Pioneer League, expanded this agreement to become an official MLB Partner League.

The Atlantic League is generally regarded as the most successful and highest level of baseball among independent leagues, and is comparable to the Double-A level. The Atlantic League has had more marquee players than any other independent league, including Jose Canseco, Mat Latos, Steve Lombardozzi Jr., Francisco Rodríguez, Chien-Ming Wang, Roger Clemens, Rich Hill, Scott Kazmir, Juan González, and Dontrelle Willis. Two former Atlantic League players are in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum, Tim Raines and Rickey Henderson. Gary Carter, another Hall of Famer, managed in the league. The Atlantic League has had many notable managers and coaches, including Wally Backman, Frank Viola, Tommy John, Sparky Lyle, and Bud Harrelson. The Atlantic League has consistently posted higher per game and per season attendance numbers than other independent circuits such the American Association, Frontier League and Pioneer League.

==History==
In 1998, the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball played its inaugural season, with teams in Bridgewater, Newark, and Atlantic City, New Jersey; Nashua, New Hampshire; Newburgh, New York; and Bridgeport, Connecticut. The creation of the league was the result of the New York Mets&#x27; objection to Frank Boulton&#x27;s proposal to move the former Albany-Colonie Yankees because of its territorial rights to the region. Boulton, a Long Island, New York native, decided to create a new league that would have a higher salary cap for its players and a longer season than most of the other independent baseball organizations. He modeled the Atlantic League after the older Pacific Coast League, with facilities that exceed AAA-level standards. Boulton also emphasized signing players of Major League Baseball experience for all Atlantic League teams, raising the level of play above other independent leagues.

In 2010, the league announced that it would be expanding to Sugar Land, Texas and adding its first franchise not located in an Atlantic coast state. The Sugar Land Skeeters began play in 2012. In 2010, amid financial struggles, the Newark Bears moved from the Atlantic League to the Can-Am League, leaving the Bridgeport Bluefish and Somerset Patriots as the only teams remaining from the league&#x27;s inaugural season. In the summer of 2013, then-ALPB President Frank Boulton announced that he would be resigning so that he could devote more time to operating the Long Island Ducks. He was replaced by longtime high-ranking Major League Baseball executive Rick White. On July 8, 2015, the Atlantic League began using Rawlings baseballs with red and blue seams, virtually unused in the sport since the American League swapped the blue in their seams for red in 1934.

On September 1, 2015, the Atlantic League announced conditional approval for an expansion team or a relocated team to play in New Britain, Connecticut for the 2016 season. On October 21, 2015, the Camden Riversharks announced they would cease operations immediately due to the inability to reach an agreement on lease terms with the owner of Campbell&#x27;s Field, the Camden County Improvement Authority. The team was replaced by the New Britain Bees for the 2016 season. On May 29, 2016, Jennie Finch was the guest manager for the league&#x27;s Bridgeport Bluefish, thus becoming the first woman to manage a professional baseball team.

Shortly before the conclusion of the 2017 season, the city of Bridgeport, Connecticut voted to not continue with professional baseball in the city and announced plans to convert The Ballpark at Harbor Yard into a music amphitheater; the Bridgeport Bluefish announced plans to relocate to High Point, North Carolina in 2019 when the construction of a new multipurpose facility in High Point is completed. League officials announced the return of the Pennsylvania Road Warriors, an all road game team, to keep the league at an even eight teams while the Bluefish go inactive for the 2018 season.

In 2015, the Atlantic League experienced a watershed moment for independent baseball when it signed a formal agreement with Major League Baseball which put into writing the rules which the ALPB would follow in selling its players&#x27; contracts to MLB clubs and their affiliates. This marked the first time that MLB, which has enjoyed a U.S. Supreme Court-granted antitrust exemption since 1922, had made any formal agreement with or acknowledgment of an independent baseball league.

===2020s===
In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the league announced that it would be unable to operate for the 2020 season with the current 8 member ballclubs, thereby canceling its season. Several teams (Somerset, York, and Lancaster) did not gain necessary approval from governmental and health officials to open their ballparks to the capacity level necessary for competition. They used their stadiums to host recreational and community-based events, as well as local baseball activities where allowed. Meanwhile, the Long Island Ducks, High Point Rockers, and Southern Maryland Blue Crabs initially attempted to partner with teams from other leagues in order to play a 70-game season from mid-July through the end of September. However, due to ongoing restrictions and capacity limitations, they ultimately decided to suspend all baseball activities for the 2020 season. The only teams that played in 2020 was the Sugar Land Skeeters, who would create a new 4-team independent league in Texas, with all 60 games played at Constellation Field, and the Somerset Patriots, who played weekend games with a second squad called the New Jersey Blasters.

In July 2020, the league announced the addition of a new franchise in Gastonia, North Carolina beginning in 2021; it is the league&#x27;s second team based in North Carolina.

In November 2020, the Atlantic League lost its last charter franchise and its westernmost franchise when both teams became official minor league affiliates. On November 7, the Somerset Patriots announced that they were leaving the league to join the MLB-affiliated Eastern League, where they will replace the Trenton Thunder as the Double-A affiliate of the New York Yankees. Approximately two weeks later, the Houston Astros announced that they had purchased a controlling stake in the Sugar Land Skeeters and, as a result, the Skeeters would become the Astros&#x27; Triple-A affiliate and join the Pacific Coast League.

On February 18, 2021, the league announced the addition of the Lexington Legends, previously the Class A South Atlantic League affiliate of the Kansas City Royals, for the 2021 season. The Charleston Dirty Birds, formerly the West Virginia Power of the South Atlantic League, announced their move to the league on February 24, 2021.

On September 1, 2021, the league announced the addition of a new Hagerstown, Maryland franchise with the intent to begin play in 2023 pending ballpark construction. In 2022 it was announced that the team wouldn&#x27;t begin play until 2024 due to construction delays.

In 2022, Kelsie Whitmore signed with the Staten Island FerryHawks of the Atlantic League, and started a game for them in left field; this made her the first woman to start an Atlantic League game. Later that year she became the first woman to pitch in an Atlantic League game when she made her first pitching appearance for Staten Island; entering the game with the bases loaded and two outs, she retired Ryan Jackson, a former major leaguer, on a fly out to end the inning.

On July 20, 2023, the Hagerstown team announced that they would be named the Hagerstown Flying Boxcars. In September 2023 it was announced that Spire City Ghost Hounds would be on hiatus during the 2024 season due to the league now having an odd number of teams with the addition of the Hagerstown franchise. The team was set to return for the 2025 season; however, the Ghost Hounds were not listed on the 2025 season schedule.

On November 22, 2023, the Atlantic League terminated the membership of the Gastonia Honey Hunters, citing significant unpaid debts to the league. Rick White, president of the Atlantic League, confirmed that the Honey Hunters were terminated, but said that the Atlantic League intended to field a team in Gastonia in 2024. In February 2024, the league named Zawyer Sports &amp; Entertainment as the new owners for the 2024 season with the team name, Gastonia Ghost Peppers, announced in October 2024. The Gastonia Ghost Peppers played their first game on April 25, 2024, a 3–2 loss to the Southern Maryland Blue Crabs.

===Experimental rules===
==== 2019 ====
In March 2019, the Atlantic League and Major League Baseball reached agreement to test multiple rule changes during the 2019 Atlantic League season:
* Use of a radar tracking system to assist umpires in calling balls and strikes
* Reducing the time between half innings by 20 seconds, from 2 minutes 5 seconds to 1:45
* Requiring pitchers to face at least three batters
** Exceptions: side is retired or injury
* Banning mound visits
** Exceptions: pitching change or for medical issues
* Restricting infield shifts
** Two infielders must be positioned on each side of second base
* Increasing the size of bases from to 
** The size of home plate is not altered
* Moving the pitching rubber on the pitcher&#x27;s mound back 
** This change would have taken effect in the second half of the season

In April 2019, implementation of two of the changes was delayed:
* The tracking system for calling balls and strikes &quot;will be implemented gradually over the course of the 2019 season&quot;
* Moving the pitching rubber back will not occur until the second half of the 2020 Atlantic League season; this rule change was never implemented.

The tracking system for calling balls and strikes was introduced at the league&#x27;s all-star game on July 10. In addition to rule changes noted above, additional changes being implemented for the second half of the league&#x27;s 2019 season are:
* Pitchers required to step off rubber to attempt pickoff
* One foul bunt permitted with two strikes
* Batters may &quot;steal&quot; first base
** &quot;Any pitched ball not caught by the catcher shall be subject to the same baserunning rules for the batter as an uncaught third strike, with the exception of the first base occupied with less than two out exclusion.&quot;
* &quot;Check swings&quot; more batter-friendly
** &quot;In making his ruling, the base umpire should determine whether the batter&#x27;s wrists &#x27;rolled over&#x27; during an attempt to strike at the ball and, if not, call the pitch a ball.&quot;

====2021====
The Atlantic League and MLB jointly announced that the former would adopt several additional experimental rules for the 2021 season:
* The automated ball-strike calling system introduced for 2019 remains in use, but has been tweaked. The strike zone, which had been a three-dimensional space above home plate in 2019, changed to a two-dimensional space measured at the front of home plate.
* A &quot;double-hook&quot; rule is in force for the entire season. Under this rule, once a team removes its starting pitcher, it loses the right to use a designated hitter for the rest of the game.
* During the second half of the season (starting on August 3), the pitcher&#x27;s rubber was moved back , making the distance between the front edge of the rubber to the rear point of home plate .

====2022====
In January 2022, the Atlantic League announced they would no longer be using the following rules for the 2022 season:
* The automated ball-strike system that was first introduced in 2019, would no longer be used to assist home plate umpires in making ball or strike decisions. While the Atlantic League discontinued the use of the system, MLB opted to use the system in Spring Training games and in Triple A for the 2022 season.
* The distance of the pitching rubber to home plate went back to its original length, 60 feet 6 inches, down from 61 feet 6 inches. The mound was first moved a foot back (from 60 feet 6 inches to 61 feet 6 inches) on August 3, 2021, half-way through the 2021 season.
In March 2022, the MLB announced modifications to the &quot;double-hook&quot; rule and reintroduced the &quot;dropped pitch&quot; rule for the 2023 season:

* The &quot;double-hook&quot; rule was modified so that clubs do not lose their designated hitter if their starting pitcher completes at least five innings.
* The &quot;dropped pitch&quot; rule allows batters to attempt to advance for first on any pitch not caught in the air by the catcher, even with a runner on first. Those that reach first base will be awarded a hit.

==== 2023 ====
In April 2023, it was announced that the Atlantic League would be testing three rules for the 2023 season:

* The &quot;designated pinch-runner&quot; rule will have clubs designate a pinch runner that is not in the starting line up. That player can be substituted into the game at any point as a baserunner, but unlike typical substitutions the player that is substituted for as well as the pinch-runner will be allowed to return to the game with no penalty.
* Pitchers will be allowed only one disengagement per at-bat. Any additional disengagements will be counted as a balk unless an out is recorded.
* The &quot;double-hook&quot; rule will continue being used in its 2022 form.
* The minimum salary for players will be increased to $30,250 per year.

==Major League Baseball players==
Some Atlantic League players have come from, or advanced to, the higher ranks of Major League Baseball. Some have resurrected their careers and returned to the majors, while others played in the independent league during the start or end of their careers. The following is a list of some of those players:

* Ruben Sierra - Played for the Atlantic City Surf in 1999 after more than a decade in MLB. Returned to the Texas Rangers in 2000 and named American League Comeback Player of the Year in 2001.

<doc id="63786" wikidata="Q908909" url="?curid=63786" title="Morepork">
<text>The morepork (Ninox novaeseelandiae), better known as the morepork owl, and also known by numerous other onomatopoeic names (such as boobook, mopoke or ruru), is a smallish, brown owl species found in New Zealand, and to the northwest, on Norfolk Island, an Australian territory. It was also, formerly, found on Lord Howe Island. Three subspecies of the morepork are recognised, one of which is extinct and another that exists only as a hybrid population.

First described by Johann Friedrich Gmelin in 1788, the morepork was thought to be the same species as the Australian boobook (&quot;N. boobook&quot;), native to Australia, Timor-Leste and New Guinea, something that endured for nearly two hundred years, until 1999. Similarly, it was also considered the same as the Tasmanian boobook (&quot;N. leucopsis&quot;) until 2022.

The morepork has dark-brown plumage with prominent pale spots and golden-yellow eyes. Like most owls, the species is generally nocturnal, though may be crepuscular at times (or active at dawn and dusk), retiring to roost in secluded spots within the branches of trees. The morepork feeds on larger insects and small vertebrates, hunting by pouncing on them from tree perches. As with all owls, the morepork has supreme night vision and excellent hearing, able to locate a tiny lizard or rodent from many metres above and away. They then stealthily approach their targeted prey with near-silent flight, without flapping their wings, the prey often not even aware they are being pursued. 

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the morepork&#x27;s population and its potential for decline, and ranked the species as being of least concern (not currently at-risk), owing to its presently large range and apparently stable population.

==Taxonomy==
The morepork was formally described in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the other owls in the genus &quot;Strix&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Strix novaeseelandiae&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;New Zeeland owl&quot; from Queen Charlotte Sound that had been described in 1781 by the English ornithologist John Latham in his multi-volume &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. Latham obtained his information from Johann Reinhold Forster who had accompanied James Cook on his second voyage to the Pacific Ocean. The morepork is now one of 37 owls placed in the genus &quot;Ninox&quot; that was introduced in 1837 by English naturalist Brian Houghton Hodgson. &quot;Morepork&quot; has been designated the official name by the International Ornithological Committee.

Three subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;N. n. novaeseelandiae&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1788) – North and South Islands of New Zealand and Stewart Island
* &quot;N. n. undulata&quot; (Latham, 1801) – the Norfolk boobook, Norfolk Island (east of Australia)
*† &quot;N. n. albaria&quot; Ramsay, EP, 1888 – the Lord Howe boobook, Lord Howe Island (east of Australia) extinct

Both Gerlof Fokko Mees and Ernst Mayr regarded the taxonomy of the boobook owl as extremely challenging, the latter remarking in 1943 that it was &quot;one of the most difficult problems I have ever encountered&quot;. In his 1968 book &quot;Nightwatchmen of the Bush and Plain&quot;, Australian naturalist David Fleay observed that the boobooks from Tasmania more closely resembled those of New Zealand than those from mainland Australia, though he followed Mees in treating them as a single species. 
Janette Norman and colleagues tested the cytochrome &quot;b&quot; DNA of three subspecies (as well as the powerful and rufous owls) to ascertain whether the closest relative was used in breeding with the last surviving female of the Norfolk boobook. They discovered that although the Norfolk boobook was similar in plumage to the Tasmanian boobook, it was genetically much closer to the New Zealand subspecies. In fact, the two were so close genetically that they considered whether the Norfolk boobook should be recognised as a separate taxon at all, although they conceded the two were easily distinguishable in appearance, so maintained the three as subspecies; the Tasmanian boobook only diverged by 2.7% from the other two, while the powerful and rufous owls diverged by 4.4% from each other. Leading from this, the Australian boobook was split from the Tasmanian boobook and morepork in volume 5 of the &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World&quot;; however, several authors, including Les Christidis and Walter Boles, contested that the data had been misinterpreted from the Norman study, which had not sampled any Australian mainland boobooks at all. They treated the three taxa (southern, Tasmanian boobooks, and moreporks) as a single species.

Examining both morphological and genetic (cytochrome &quot;b&quot;) characters, Michael Wink and colleagues concluded that the Australian boobook was distinct from the morepork, as was the Tasmanian boobook, which is raised to species status as &quot;Ninox leucopsis&quot;. In 2022, the International Ornithological Congress reclassified the Tasmanian boobook and morepork as distinct species.

==Description==

The morepork is long, with the female slightly larger than the male. Females are slightly heavier at compared with the male&#x27;s . The morepork has generally dark brown head and upperparts, with pale brown spots on head and neck and white markings on the rest of the upperparts, with a pale yellow-white supercilium (eyebrow), dark brown ear coverts, and buff cheeks. The eyes are yellow to golden-yellow. The feathers of the chin and throat are buff with dark brown shafts. The feathers of the underparts are mostly dark brown with buff and white spots and streaks, with the larger markings on the belly making it look paler overall. The upper tail is dark brown with lighter brown bars. The cere and bill is pale blue-grey with a black cutting edge. The feet are orange or yellow with blackish claws.

Young moreporks do not attain adult plumage properly until their third or fourth year. The tips of juvenile&#x27;s feathers are white and fluffy, remnants of the nestlings&#x27; down. These are worn away over time, persisting longest on the head. The feathers of the head, neck, and underparts are fluffier overall. Their plumage is a darker and more greyish brown overall than that of adults.

==Distribution and habitat==
In New Zealand&#x27;s North Island, it is common from Rangaunu Harbour south to southern Taranaki and west of Tauranga, Lake Taupō, and Whanganui, as well as between Murupara and the Hangaroa River in the northeast, and southern Manawatū, Wellington, and Wairarapa in the south, and uncommon outside these areas. In the South Island, it is more common west of the Southern Alps, around Marlborough and in Southland. It is common on Stewart Island and offshore islands.

In New Zealand, it primarily inhabits forests dominated by &quot;Podocarpus&quot;, &quot;Nothofagus&quot;, &quot;Metrosideros&quot;, and other hardwoods, up to the alpine tree line. On Norfolk Island, it lives in forests of Norfolk Island pine (&quot;Araucaria heterophylla&quot;).

==Behaviour==
They are usually seen singly, in pairs, or in small family groups of an adult pair and up to three young.

Swamp harriers could feasibly prey on young moreporks.

During the day, moreporks sleep in roosts. Although mainly nocturnal, they are sometimes active at dawn and dusk. The main hunting times are evenings and mornings, with brief bursts of activity through the night. On dark nights, they often perch through the middle hours, and particularly if the weather is bad, may hunt by daylight, instead.

===Breeding===

Moreporks nest anywhere the trees are large enough to have hollows.

===Feeding===
Although their main hunting technique is perch-and-pounce, they are agile birds with a swift, goshawk-like wing action and the ability to maneuver rapidly when pursuing prey or hawking for insects.

They hunt a variety of animals – mainly large invertebrates including scarab and huhu beetles, moths and caterpillars, spiders, grasshoppers, and in New Zealand, wētā. They also take almost any suitably sized prey, particularly small birds, rats, and mice. They can find suitable food in pine forests as well as native forest.

==Conservation status==
A widespread and generally common species, morepork is listed as being a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, on account of its large range and stable population, with no evidence of any significant decline. Like most species of owl, the morepork is protected under Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) meaning the international import and export of the species (including parts and derivatives) is regulated.

<doc id="63788" wikidata="Q186370" url="?curid=63788" title="Troubadour">
<text>A troubadour (, ; ) was a composer and performer of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages (1100–1350). Since the word &quot;troubadour&quot; is etymologically masculine, a female equivalent is usually called a &quot;trobairitz&quot;.

The troubadour school or tradition began in the late 11th century in Occitania, but it subsequently spread to the Italian and Iberian Peninsulas. Under the influence of the troubadours, related movements sprang up throughout Europe: the Minnesang in Germany, &quot;trovadorismo&quot; in Galicia and Portugal, and that of the trouvères in northern France. Dante Alighieri in his &quot;De vulgari eloquentia&quot; defined the troubadour lyric as &quot;fictio rethorica musicaque poita&quot;: rhetorical, musical, and poetical fiction. After the &quot;classical&quot; period around the turn of the 13th century and a mid-century resurgence, the art of the troubadours declined in the 14th century and around the time of the Black Death (1348) and since died out.

The texts of troubadour songs deal mainly with themes of chivalry and courtly love. Most were metaphysical, intellectual, and formulaic. Many were humorous or vulgar satires. Works can be grouped into three styles: the &quot;trobar leu&quot; (light), &quot;trobar ric&quot; (rich), and &quot;trobar clus&quot; (closed). Likewise there were many genres, the most popular being the &quot;canso&quot;, but &quot;sirventes&quot; and &quot;tensos&quot; were especially popular in the post-classical period.

==Etymology==
The English word &quot;troubadour&quot; was borrowed from the French word first recorded in 1575 in a historical context to mean &quot;langue d&#x27;oc poet at the court in the 12th and 13th century&quot; (Jean de Nostredame, &quot;Les vies des plus célèbres et anciens Poètes provençaux&quot;, p. 14 in Gdf. Compl.). The first use and earliest form of &quot;troubador&quot; is &quot;trobadors&quot;, found in a 12th-century Occitan text by Cercamon.

The French word itself is borrowed from the Occitan &quot;trobador&quot;. It is the oblique case of the nominative &quot;trobaire&quot; &quot;composer&quot;, related to &quot;trobar&quot; &quot;to compose, to discuss, to invent&quot; (Wace, &quot;Brut&quot;, editions I. Arnold, 3342). &quot;Trobar&quot; may come, in turn, from the hypothetical Late Latin *&quot;tropāre&quot; &quot;to compose, to invent a poem&quot; by regular phonetic change. This reconstructed form is based on the Latin root &quot;tropus&quot;, meaning a trope. In turn, the Latin word derives ultimately from Greek (&quot;trópos&quot;), meaning &quot;turn, manner&quot;. Intervocal Latin shifted regularly to in Occitan (cf. Latin &quot;sapere&quot; → Occitan &quot;saber&quot;, French &quot;savoir&quot; &quot;to know&quot;). The Latin suffix &quot;-ātor&quot;, &quot;-ātōris&quot; explains the Occitan suffix, according to its declension and accentuation: Gallo-Romance *&quot;tropātor&quot; → Occitan &quot;trobaire&quot; (subject case) and *&quot;tropātōre&quot; → Occitan &quot;trobador&quot; (oblique case).

There is an alternative theory to explain the meaning of &quot;trobar&quot; as &quot;to compose, to discuss, to invent&quot;. It has the support of some historians, specialists of literature, and musicologists to justify the troubadours&#x27; origins in Arabic Andalusian musical practices. According to them, the Arabic word &quot;ṭaraba&quot; &quot;music&quot; (from the triliteral root &quot;ṭ–r–b&quot; &quot;provoke emotion, excitement, agitation; make music, entertain by singing&quot; as in , &quot;ṭarab ʾandalusī&quot;) could partly be the etymon of the verb &quot;trobar&quot;. Another Arabic root had already been proposed before: &quot;ḍ–r–b&quot; () &quot;strike&quot;, by extension &quot;play a musical instrument&quot;.

In archaic and classical troubadour poetry, the word is only used in a mocking sense, having more or less the meaning of &quot;somebody who makes things up&quot;. Cercamon writes:
:&quot;Ist trobador, entre ver e mentir,&quot;
:&quot;Afollon drutz e molhers et espos,&quot;
:&quot;E van dizen qu&#x27;Amors vay en biays&quot;
::(These troubadours, between truth and lies/corrupt lovers, women and husbands, / and keep saying that Love proceeds obliquely).

Peire d&#x27;Alvernha also begins his famous mockery of contemporary authors &quot;cantarai d&#x27;aquest trobadors&quot;, after which he proceeds to explain why none of them is worth anything. When referring to themselves seriously, troubadours almost invariably use the word &quot;chantaire&quot; (&quot;singer&quot;).

==Origins==
The early study of the troubadours focused intensely on their origins. No academic consensus was ever achieved in the area. Today, one can distinguish at least eleven competing theories (the adjectives used below are a blend from the Grove Dictionary of Music and Roger Boase&#x27;s &quot;The Origins and Meaning of Courtly Love&quot;):

===Arabic===
The sixteenth century Italian historian Giammaria Barbieri was perhaps the first to suggest Arabian (also &quot;Arabist&quot; or &quot;Hispano-Arabic&quot;) influences on the music of the troubadours. Later scholars like J.B. Trend have asserted that the poetry of troubadours is connected to Arabic poetry written in the Iberian Peninsula, while others have attempted to find direct evidence of this influence. In examining the works of William IX of Aquitaine, Évariste Lévi-Provençal and other scholars found three lines that they believed were in some form of Arabic, indicating a potential Andalusian origin for his works. The scholars attempted to translate the lines in question, though the medievalist Istvan Frank contended that the lines were not Arabic at all, but instead the result of the rewriting of the original by a later scribe.

Scholars like Ramón Menéndez Pidal stated that the troubadour tradition was created by William, who had been influenced by Moorish music and poetry while fighting with the Reconquista. However, George T. Beech states that there is only one documented battle that William fought in the Iberian Peninsula, and it occurred towards the end of his life. Beech adds that while the sources of William&#x27;s inspirations are uncertain, he and his father did have individuals within their extended family with Iberian origins, and he may have been friendly with some Europeans who could speak the Arabic language. Regardless of William&#x27;s personal involvement in the tradition&#x27;s creation, Magda Bogin states that Arab poetry was likely one of several influences on European &quot;courtly love poetry&quot;, citing Ibn Hazm&#x27;s &quot;The Ring of the Dove&quot; as an example of a similar Arab tradition.

Methods of transmission from Arab Iberia to the rest of Europe did exist, such as the Toledo School of Translators, though it only began translating major romances from Arabic into Latin in the second half of the thirteenth century, with objectionable sexual content removed in deference to the Catholic Church. 

===Bernardine-Marianist===

According to the Bernardine-Marianist (or Christian) theory, it was the theology espoused by Bernard of Clairvaux and the increasingly important Mariology that most strongly influenced the development of the troubadour genre. Specifically, the emphasis on religious and spiritual love, disinterestedness, mysticism, and devotion to Mary explained &quot;courtly love&quot;. The emphasis of the reforming Robert of Arbrissel on &quot;matronage&quot; to achieve his ends can explain the troubadour attitude towards women.

Chronologically, however, this hypothesis is hard to sustain, as the forces believed to have given rise to the phenomenon arrived later than it, but the influence of Bernardine and Marian theology can be retained without the origins theory. This theory was advanced early by Eduard Wechssler and further by Dmitri Scheludko (who emphasises the Cluniac Reform) and Guido Errante. Mario Casella and Leo Spitzer have added &quot;Augustinian&quot; influence to it.

===Celtic or chivalric-matriarchal===
The survival of pre-Christian sexual &quot;mores&quot; and warrior codes from matriarchal societies, be they Celtic, Germanic, or Pictish, among the aristocracy of Europe can account for the idea (fusion) of &quot;courtly love&quot;. The existence of pre-Christian matriarchy has usually been treated with scepticism as has the persistence of underlying paganism in high medieval Europe, though the Celts and Germanic tribes were certainly less patriarchal than the Greco-Romans.

===Classical Latin===
The classical Latin theory emphasises parallels between Ovid, especially his &quot;Amores&quot; and &quot;Ars amatoria&quot;, and the lyric of courtly love. The &quot;aetas ovidiana&quot; that predominated in the 11th century in and around Orléans, the quasi-Ciceronian ideology that held sway in the Imperial court, and the scraps of Plato then available to scholars have all been cited as classical influences on troubadour poetry.

===Crypto-Cathar===
According to this thesis, troubadour poetry is a reflection of Cathar religious doctrine. While the theory is supported by the traditional and near-universal account of the decline of the troubadours coinciding with the suppression of Catharism during the Albigensian Crusade (first half of the 13th century), support for it has come in waves. The explicitly Catholic meaning of many early troubadour works also works against the theory.

===Liturgical===
The troubadour lyric may be a development of the Christian liturgy and hymnody. The influence of the Song of Songs has even been suggested. There is no preceding Latin poetry resembling that of the troubadours. On those grounds, no theory of the latter&#x27;s origins in classical or post-classical Latin can be constructed, but that has not deterred some, who believe that a pre-existing Latin corpus must merely be lost to us. That many troubadours received their grammatical training in Latin through the Church (from &quot;clerici&quot;, clerics) and that many were trained musically by the Church is well-attested. The musical school of Saint Martial&#x27;s at Limoges has been singled out in this regard. &quot;Para-liturgical&quot; tropes were in use there in the era preceding the troubadours&#x27; appearance.

===Feudal-social===
This theory or set of related theories has gained ground in the 20th century. It is more a methodological approach to the question than a theory; it asks not from where the content or form of the lyric came but rather in what situation or circumstances did it arise. Under Marxist influence, Erich Köhler, Marc Bloch, and Georges Duby have suggested that the &quot;essential hegemony&quot; in the castle of the lord&#x27;s wife during his absence was a driving force. The use of feudal terminology in troubadour poems is seen as evidence. This theory has been developed away from sociological towards psychological explanation.

===Folklore===
This theory may relate to spring folk rituals. According to María Rosa Menocal, Alfred Jeanroy first suggested that folklore and oral tradition gave rise to troubadour poetry in 1883. According to F. M. Warren, it was Gaston Paris, Jeanroy&#x27;s reviewer, in 1891 who first located troubadour origins in the festive dances of women hearkening the spring in the Loire Valley. This theory has since been widely discredited, but the discovery of the &quot;jarchas&quot; raises the question of the extent of literature (oral or written) in the 11th century and earlier.

===Medieval Latin or Goliardic===
Hans Spanke analysed the intertextual connexion between vernacular and medieval Latin (such as Goliardic) songs. This theory is supported by Reto Bezzola, Peter Dronke, and musicologist Jacques Chailley. According to them, &quot;trobar&quot; means &quot;inventing a trope&quot;, the trope being a poem where the words are used with a meaning different from their common signification, i.e. metaphor and metonymy. This poem was originally inserted in a serial of modulations ending a liturgic song. Then the trope became an autonomous piece organized in stanza form. The influence of late 11th-century poets of the &quot;Loire school&quot;, such as Marbod of Rennes and Hildebert of Lavardin, is stressed in this connexion by Brinkmann.

===Neoplatonic===
This theory is one of the more intellectualising. The &quot;ennobling effects of love&quot; in specific have been identified as neoplatonic. It is viewed either as a strength or weakness that this theory requires a second theory about how the neoplatonism was transmitted to the troubadours; perhaps it can be coupled with one of the other origins stories or perhaps it is just peripheral. Käte Axhausen has &quot;exploited&quot; this theory and A. J. Denomy has linked it with the Arabist (through Avicenna) and the Cathar (through John Scotus Eriugena).

==History==
===Early period===
The earliest troubadour whose work survives is Guilhèm de Peitieus, better known as Duke William IX of Aquitaine (1071–1126). Peter Dronke, author of &quot;The Medieval Lyric&quot;, however, believes that &quot;[his] songs represent not the beginnings of a tradition but summits of achievement in that tradition.&quot; His name has been preserved because he was the Duke of Aquitaine, but his work plays with already established structures; Eble II of Ventadorn is often credited as a predecessor, though none of his work survives. Orderic Vitalis referred to William composing songs about his experiences on his return from the Crusade of 1101 (c. 1102). This may be the earliest reference to troubadour lyrics. Orderic also provides us (1135) with what may be the first description of a troubadour performance: an eyewitness account of William of Aquitaine.

&quot;Picauensis uero dux ... miserias captiuitatis suae ... coram regibus et magnatis atque Christianis coetibus multotiens retulit rythmicis uersibus cum facetis modulationibus&quot;. (X.21)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Then the Poitevin duke ... the miseries of his captivity ... before kings, magnates, and Christian assemblies many times related with rhythmic verses and witty measures.
===Spread===

The first half of the 12th century saw relatively few recorded troubadours. Only in the last decades of the century did troubadour activity explode. Almost half of all troubadour works that survive are from the period 1180–1220.
In total, moreover, there are over 2,500 troubadour lyrics available to be studied as linguistic artifacts (Akehurst, 23).
The troubadour tradition seems to have begun in western Aquitaine (Poitou and Saintonge) and Gascony, from there spreading over into eastern Aquitaine (Limousin and Auvergne) and Provence. At its height it had become popular in Languedoc and the regions of Rouergue, Toulouse, and Quercy (c. 1200). Finally, in the early 13th century it began to spread into first Italy and then Catalonia, whence to the rest of modern Spain and then Portugal. This development has been called the &quot;rayonnement des troubadours&quot; ().

===Classical period===
The classical period of troubadour activity lasted from about 1170 until about 1213. The most famous names among the ranks of troubadours belong to this period. During this period the lyric art of the troubadours reached the height of its popularity and the number of surviving poems is greatest from this period. During this period the &quot;canso&quot;, or love song, became distinguishable as a genre. The master of the &quot;canso&quot; and the troubadour who epitomises the classical period is Bernart de Ventadorn. He was highly regarded by his contemporaries, as were Giraut de Bornelh, reputed by his biographer to be the greatest composer of melodies to ever live, and Bertran de Born, the master of the &quot;sirventes&quot;, or political song, which became increasingly popular in this period.

The classical period came to be seen by later generations, especially in the 14th and 15th centuries and outside of Occitania, as representing the high point of lyric poetry and models to be emulated. The language of the classic poets, its grammar and vocabulary, their style and themes, were the ideal to which poets of the troubadour revival in Toulouse (creation of the Consistori del Gay Saber in 1323) and their Catalan and Castilian contemporaries aspired. During the classical period the &quot;rules&quot; of poetic composition had first become standardised and written down, first by Raimon Vidal and then by Uc Faidit.

==Lives==

The 450 or so troubadours known to historians came from a variety of backgrounds. They made their living in a variety of ways, lived, and travelled in many different places, and were actors in many types of social context. The troubadours were not wandering entertainers. Typically, they stayed in one place for a lengthy period of time under the patronage of a wealthy nobleman or woman. Many did travel extensively, however, sojourning at one court and then another.

===Status===
The earliest known troubadour, the Duke of Aquitaine, came from the high nobility. He was followed immediately by two poets of unknown origins, known only by their sobriquets, Cercamon and Marcabru, and by a member of the princely class, Jaufre Rudel. Many troubadours are described in their &quot;vidas&quot; as poor knights. It was one of the most common descriptors of status. Berenguier de Palazol, Gausbert Amiel, Guilhem Ademar, Guiraudo lo Ros, Marcabru, Peire de Maensac, Peirol, Raimon de Miraval, Rigaut de Berbezilh, and Uc de Pena are all so described. Albertet de Sestaro is described as the son of a noble jongleur, presumably a petty noble lineage.

Later troubadours especially could belong to lower classes, ranging from the middle class of merchants and &quot;burgers&quot; (persons of urban standing) to tradesmen and others who worked with their hands. Salh d&#x27;Escola and Elias de Barjols were described as the sons of merchants and Elias Fonsalada was the son of a burger and jongleur. Perdigon was the son of a &quot;poor fisherman&quot; and Elias Cairel of a blacksmith. Arnaut de Mareuil is specified in his &quot;vida&quot; as coming from a poor family, but whether this family was poor by noble standards or materially is not apparent.

Many troubadours also possessed a clerical education. For some this was their springboard to composition, since their clerical education equipped them with an understanding of musical and poetic forms as well as vocal training. The &quot;vidas&quot; of the following troubadours note their clerical status: Aimeric de Belenoi, Folquet de Marselha (who became a bishop), Gui d&#x27;Ussel, Guillem Ramon de Gironella, Jofre de Foixà (who became an abbot), Peire de Bussignac, Peire Rogier, Raimon de Cornet, Uc Brunet, and Uc de Saint Circ.

===&quot;Trobadors&quot; and &quot;joglars&quot;===
The Occitan words &quot;trobador&quot; and &quot;trobaire&quot; are relatively rare compared with the verb &quot;trobar&quot; (compose, invent), which was usually applied to the writing of poetry. It signified that a poem was original to an author (&quot;trobador&quot;) and was not merely sung or played by one. The term was used mostly for poetry only and in more careful works, like the &quot;vidas&quot;, is not generally applied to the composition of music or to singing, though the troubadour&#x27;s poetry itself is not so careful. Sometime in the middle of the 12th century, however, a distinction was definitely being made between an inventor of original verse and the performers of others&#x27;. The latter were called &quot;joglars&quot; in both Occitan and Catalan, from the Latin &quot;ioculatores&quot;, giving rise also to the French &quot;jongleur&quot;, Castilian &quot;juglar&quot;, and English juggler, which has come to refer to a more specific breed of performer. The medieval &quot;jongleur/joglar&quot; is really a minstrel.

At the height of troubadour poetry (the &quot;classical period&quot;), troubadours are often found attacking &quot;jongleurs&quot; and at least two small genres arose around the theme: the &quot;ensenhamen joglaresc&quot; and the &quot;sirventes joglaresc&quot;. These terms are debated, however, since the adjective &quot;joglaresc&quot; seems to imply &quot;in the manner of the &quot;jongleurs&quot;&quot;. Inevitably, however, pieces of these genres are verbal attacks at &quot;jongleurs&quot;, in general and in specific, with named individuals being called out. It is clear, for example from the poetry of Bertran de Born, that &quot;jongleurs&quot; were performers who did not usually compose. They often performed the troubadours&#x27; songs: singing, playing instruments, dancing, and even doing acrobatics.

In the late 13th century Guiraut Riquier bemoaned the inexactness of his contemporaries and wrote a letter to Alfonso X of Castile, a noted patron of literature and learning of all kinds, for clarification on the proper reference of the terms &quot;trobador&quot; and &quot;joglar&quot;. According to Riquier, every vocation deserved a name of its own and the sloppy usage of &quot;joglar&quot; assured that it covered a multitude of activities, some, no doubt, with which Riquier did not wish to be associated. In the end Riquier argued—and Alfonso X seems to agree, though his &quot;response&quot; was probably penned by Riquier—that a &quot;joglar&quot; was a courtly entertainer (as opposed to popular or low-class one) and a troubadour was a poet and composer.

Despite the distinctions noted, many troubadours were also known as jongleurs, either before they began composing or alongside. Aimeric de Belenoi, Aimeric de Sarlat, Albertet Cailla, Arnaut de Mareuil, Elias de Barjols, Elias Fonsalada, Falquet de Romans, Guillem Magret, Guiraut de Calanso, Nicoletto da Torino, Peire Raimon de Tolosa, Peire Rogier, Peire de Valeira, Peirol, Pistoleta, Perdigon, Salh d&#x27;Escola, Uc de la Bacalaria, Uc Brunet, and Uc de Saint Circ were jongleur-troubadours.

===&quot;Vidas&quot; and &quot;razos&quot;===

A &quot;vida&quot; is a brief prose biography, written in Occitan, of a troubadour. The word &quot;vida&quot; means &quot;life&quot; in Occitan. In the chansonniers, the manuscript collections of medieval troubadour poetry, the works of a particular author are often accompanied by a short prose biography. The &quot;vidas&quot; are important early works of vernacular prose nonfiction. Nevertheless, it appears that many of them derive their facts from literal readings of their objects&#x27; poems, which leaves their historical reliability in doubt. Most of the &quot;vidas&quot; were composed in Italy in the 1220s, many by Uc de Saint Circ.

A &quot;razo&quot; (from Occitan for &quot;reason&quot;) was a similar short piece of Occitan prose detailing the circumstances of a particular composition. A &quot;razo&quot; normally introduced the poem it explained; it might, however, share some of the characteristics of a &quot;vida&quot;. The &quot;razos&quot; suffer from the same problems as the &quot;vidas&quot; in terms of reliability. Many are likewise the work of Uc de Saint Circ.

===&quot;Podestà&quot;-troubadours===
A phenomenon arose in Italy, recognised around the turn of the 20th century by Giulio Bertoni, of men serving in several cities as &quot;podestàs&quot; on behalf of either the Guelph or Ghibelline party and writing political verse in Occitan rhyme. These figures generally came from the urban middle class. They aspired to high culture and though, unlike the nobility, they were not patrons of literature, they were its disseminators and its readers.

The first &quot;podestà&quot;-troubadour was Rambertino Buvalelli, possibly the first troubadour native to the Italian Peninsula, who was &quot;podestà&quot; of Genoa between 1218 and 1221. Rambertino, a Guelph, served at one time or another as &quot;podestà&quot; of Brescia, Milan, Parma, Mantua, and Verona. It was probably during his three-year tenure there that he introduced Occitan lyric poetry to the city, which was later to develop a flourishing Occitan literary culture.

Among the &quot;podestà&quot;-troubadours to follow Rambertino, four were from Genoa: the Guelphs Luca Grimaldi, who also served in Florence, Milan, and Ventimiglia, and Luchetto Gattilusio, who served in Milan, Cremona, and Bologna, and the Ghibellines Perceval Doria, who served in Arles, Avignon, Asti, and Parma, and Simon Doria, sometime &quot;podestà&quot; of Savona and Albenga. Among the non-Genoese &quot;podestà&quot;-troubadours was Alberico da Romano, a nobleman of high rank who governed Vicenza and Treviso as variously a Ghibelline and a Guelph. He was a patron as well as a composer of Occitan lyric.

Mention should be made of the Provençal troubadour Isnart d&#x27;Entrevenas, who was &quot;podestà&quot; of Arles in 1220, though he does not fit the phenomenon Giulio Bertoni first identified in Italy.

===Trobairitz===

The &quot;trobairitz&quot; were the female troubadours, the first female composers of secular music in the Western tradition. The word &quot;trobairitz&quot; was first used in the 13th-century &quot;Romance of Flamenca&quot; and its derivation is the same as that of &quot;trobaire&quot; but in feminine form. There were also female counterparts to the &quot;joglars&quot;: the &quot;joglaresas&quot;. The number of trobairitz varies between sources: there were twenty or twenty-one named trobairitz, plus an additional poet known only as Domna H. There are several anonymous texts ascribed to women; the total number of trobairitz texts varies from twenty-two (Schultz-Gora), twenty-five (Bec), thirty-six (Bruckner, Shepard, and White), and forty-six (Rieger). Only one melody composed by a trobairitz (the Comtessa de Dia) survives. Out of a total of about 450 troubadours and 2,500 troubadour works, the trobairitz and their corpus form a minor but interesting and informative portion. They are, therefore, quite well studied.

The trobairitz were in most respects as varied a lot as their male counterparts, with the general exceptions of their poetic style and their provenance. They wrote predominantly &quot;cansos&quot; and &quot;tensos&quot;; only one &quot;sirventes&quot; by a named woman, Gormonda de Monpeslier, survives (though two anonymous ones are attributed to women). One &quot;salut d&#x27;amor&quot;, by a woman (Azalais d&#x27;Altier) to a woman (Clara d&#x27;Anduza) is also extant and one anonymous &quot;planh&quot; is usually assigned a female authorship. They wrote almost entirely within the &quot;trobar leu&quot; style; only two poems, one by Lombarda and another Alais, Yselda, and Carenza, are usually considered to belong to the more demanding &quot;trobar clus&quot;. None of the trobairitz were prolific, or if they were their work has not survived. Only two have left us more than one piece: the Comtessa de Dia, with four, and Castelloza, with three or four. One of the known trobairitz, Gaudairença, wrote a song entitled &quot;Coblas e dansas&quot;, which has not survived; no other piece of hers has either.

The trobairitz came almost to a woman from Occitania. There are representatives from the Auvergne, Provence, Languedoc, the Dauphiné, Toulousain, and the Limousin. One trobairitz, Ysabella, may have been born in Périgord, Northern Italy, Greece, or Palestine. All the trobairitz whose families we know were high-born ladies; only one, Lombarda, was probably of the merchant class. All the trobairitz known by name lived around the same time: the late 12th and the early 13th century (c. 1170 – c. 1260). The earliest was probably Tibors de Sarenom, who was active in the 1150s (the date of her known composition is uncertain). The latest was either Garsenda of Forcalquier, who died in 1242, though her period of poetic patronage and composition probably occurred a quarter century earlier, or Guilleuma de Rosers, who composed a &quot;tenso&quot; with Lanfranc Cigala, known between 1235 and 1257. There exist brief prose biographies—&quot;vidas&quot;—for eight trobairitz: Almucs de Castelnau (actually a &quot;razo&quot;), Azalais de Porcairagues, the Comtessa de Dia, Castelloza, Iseut de Capio (also a &quot;razo&quot;), Lombarda, Maria de Ventadorn, and Tibors de Sarenom.

===Schools and styles===

Three main styles of Occitan lyric poetry have been identified: the &quot;trobar leu&quot; (light), &quot;trobar ric&quot; (rich), and &quot;trobar clus&quot; (closed, hermetic). The first was by far the most common: the wording is straightforward and relatively simple compared to the &quot;ric&quot; and literary devices are less common than in the &quot;clus&quot;. This style was the most accessible and it was immensely popular. The most famous poet of the &quot;trobar leu&quot; was Bernart de Ventadorn. The &quot;trobar clus&quot; regularly escapes modern scholarly interpretation. Words are commonly used metaphorically and symbolically and what a poem appears to be about on its surface is rarely what is intended by the poet or understood by audiences &quot;in the know&quot;. The &quot;clus&quot; style was invented early by Marcabru but only favoured by a few masters thereafter. The &quot;trobar ric&quot; style is not as opaque as the &quot;clus&quot;, rather it employs a rich vocabulary, using many words, rare words, invented words, and unusual, colourful wordings.

Modern scholars recognise several &quot;schools&quot; in the troubadour tradition. Among the earliest is a school of followers of Marcabru, sometimes called the &quot;Marcabrunian school&quot;: Bernart Marti, Bernart de Venzac, Gavaudan, and Peire d&#x27;Alvernhe. These poets favoured the &quot;trobar clus&quot; or &quot;ric&quot; or a hybrid of the two. They were often moralising in tone and critical of contemporary courtly society. Another early school, whose style seems to have fallen out of favour, was the &quot;Gascon school&quot; of Cercamon, Peire de Valeira, and Guiraut de Calanso. Cercamon was said by his biographer to have composed in the &quot;old style&quot; (&quot;la uzansa antiga&quot;) and Guiraut&#x27;s songs were &quot;d&#x27;aquella saison&quot; (&quot;of that time&quot;). This style of poetry seems to be attached to early troubadours from Gascony and was characterised by references to nature: leaves, flowers, birds, and their songs. This Gascon &quot;literary fad&quot; was unpopular in Provence in the early 13th century, harming the reputation of the poets associated with it.

In the late 13th century a school arose at Béziers, once the centre of pre-Albigensian Languedoc and of the Trencavel lordships, in the 1260s–80s. Four poets epitomise this &quot;school&quot;: Bernart d&#x27;Auriac, Joan Esteve, Joan Miralhas, and Raimon Gaucelm. The latter three were natives of Béziers and all four lived there. All were members of the urban middle class and no courtesans: Miralhas was possibly a potter and Bernart was a &quot;mayestre&quot; (teacher). All wrote in Occitan but were supporters of the French king Louis IX and the French aristocracy against the native Occitan nobility. They have been described as &quot;Gallicised&quot;. Raimon Gaucelm supported the Eighth Crusade and even wrote a &quot;planh&quot;, the only known one of its kind, to a burgher of Béziers. Joan Esteve and Bernart both composed in support of the French in the Aragonese Crusade. The Béziers poets are a shining example of the transformation of Occitania in the aftermath of the Albigensian Crusade, but also of the ability of troubadours to survive it.

===Genres===
Troubadours, at least after their style became established, usually followed some set of &quot;rules&quot;, like those of the &quot;Leys d&#x27;amors&quot; (compiled between 1328 and 1337). Initially all troubadour verses were called simply &quot;vers&quot;, yet this soon came to be reserved for only love songs and was later replaced by &quot;canso&quot;, though the term lived on as an antique expression for the troubadours&#x27; early works and was even employed with a more technically meaning by the last generation of troubadours (mid-14th century), when it was thought to derive from the Latin word &quot;verus&quot; (truth) and was thus used to describe moralising or didactic pieces. The early troubadours developed many genres and these only proliferated as rules of composition came to be put in writing. The known genres are:
*&quot;Alba&quot; (morning song) – the song of a lover as dawn approaches, often with a watchman warning of the approach of a lady&#x27;s jealous husband
*&quot;Arlabecca&quot; – a song defined by poetic metre, but perhaps once related to the rebec
*&quot;Canso&quot;, originally &quot;vers&quot;, also &quot;chanso&quot; or &quot;canço&quot; – the love song, usually consisting of five or six stanzas with an envoi
*&quot;Cobla esparsa&quot; – a stand-alone stanza
*&quot;Comiat&quot; – a song renouncing a lover
*Crusade song (&quot;canso de crozada&quot;) – a song about the Crusades, usually encouraging them
*&quot;Dansa&quot; or &quot;balada&quot; – a lively dance song with a refrain
*&quot;Descort&quot; – a song heavily discordant in verse form and/or feeling
*&quot;Desdansa&quot; – a dance designed for sad occasions
*&quot;Devinalh&quot; – a riddle or cryptogram
*&quot;Ensenhamen&quot; – a long didactic poem, usually not divided into stanzas, teaching a moral or practical lesson
*&quot;Enuig&quot; – a poem expressing indignation or feelings of insult
*&quot;Escondig&quot; – a lover&#x27;s apology
*&quot;Estampida&quot; – a dance-like song
*&quot;Gap&quot; – a boasting song, often presented as a challenge, often similar to modern sports chants
*&quot;Maldit&quot; – a song complaining about a lady&#x27;s behaviour and character
*&quot;Partimen&quot; – a poetical exchange between two or more poets in which one is presented with a dilemma by another and responds
*&quot;Pastorela&quot; – the tale of the love request of a knight to a shepherdess
*&quot;Planh&quot; – a lament, especially on the death of some important figure
*&quot;Plazer&quot; – a poem expressing pleasure
*&quot;Salut d&#x27;amor&quot; – a love letter addressed to another, not always one&#x27;s lover
*&quot;Serena&quot; – the song of a lover waiting impatiently for the evening (to consummate his love)
*&quot;Sestina&quot; – highly structured verse form
*&quot;Sirventes&quot; – a political poem or satire, originally put in the mouth of a paid soldier (&quot;sirvens&quot;)
*Sonnet (&quot;sonet&quot;) – an Italian genre imported into Occitan verse in the 13th century
*&quot;Tenso&quot; – a poetical debate which was usually an exchange between two poets, but could be fictional
*&quot;Torneyamen&quot; – a poetical debate between three or more persons, often with a judge (like a tournament)
*&quot;Viadeira&quot; – a traveller&#x27;s complaint

All these genres were highly fluid. A cross between a &quot;sirventes&quot; and a &quot;canso&quot; was a &quot;meg-sirventes&quot; (half-&quot;sirventes&quot;). A &quot;tenso&quot; could be &quot;invented&quot; by a single poet; an &quot;alba&quot; or &quot;canso&quot; could be written with religious significance, addressed to God or the Virgin; and a &quot;sirventes&quot; may be nothing more than a political attack. The &quot;maldit&quot; and the &quot;comiat&quot; were often connected as a &quot;maldit-comiat&quot; and they could be used to attack and renounce a figure other than a lady or a lover, like a commanding officer (when combined, in a way, with the &quot;sirventes&quot;).

Peire Bremon Ricas Novas uses the term &quot;mieja chanso&quot; (half song) and Cerverí de Girona uses a similar phrase, &quot;miga canço&quot;, both to refer to a short &quot;canso&quot; and not a mixture of genres as sometimes supposed. Cerverí&#x27;s &quot;mig&quot; (or &quot;meig&quot;) &quot;vers e miga canço&quot; was a &quot;vers&quot; in the new sense (a moralising song) that was also highly critical and thus combined the &quot;canso&quot; and the &quot;sirventes&quot;. Among the more than one hundred works of Cerverí de Girona are many songs with unique labels, which may correspond more to &quot;titles&quot; than &quot;genres&quot;, but that is debatable: &quot;peguesca&quot; (nonsense), &quot;espingadura&quot; (flageolet song), &quot;libel&quot; (legal petition), &quot;esdemessa&quot; (leap), &quot;somni&quot; (dream), &quot;acuyndamen&quot; (challenge), &quot;desirança&quot; (nostalgia), &quot;aniversari&quot; (anniversary), &quot;serena&quot; (serene).

Most &quot;Crusading songs&quot; are classified either as &quot;cansos&quot; or &quot;sirventes&quot; but sometimes separately. Some styles became popular in other languages and in other literary or musical traditions. In French, the &quot;alba&quot; became the &quot;aubade&quot;, the &quot;pastorela&quot; the &quot;pastourelle&quot;, and the &quot;partimen&quot; the &quot;jeu parti&quot;. The &quot;sestina&quot; became popular in Italian literature. The troubadours were not averse to borrowing either. The &quot;planh&quot; developed out of the Latin &quot;planctus&quot; and the sonnet was stolen from the Sicilian School. The basse danse (&quot;bassa dansa&quot;) was first mentioned in the troubadour tradition (c. 1324), but only as being performed by jongleurs.

===Performance===
Troubadours performed their own songs. Jongleurs (performers) and &quot;cantaires&quot; (singers) also performed troubadours&#x27; songs. They could work from chansonniers, many of which have survived, or possibly from more rudimentary (and temporary) songbooks, none of which have survived, if they even existed. Some troubadours, like Arnaut de Maruelh, had their own jongleurs who were dedicated to singing their patron&#x27;s work. Arnaut&#x27;s &quot;joglar et cantaire&quot;, probably both a singer and a messenger, who carried his love songs to his lady, was Pistoleta. The messenger was commonplace in troubadour poetry; many songs reference a messenger who will bring it to its intended ear. A troubadour often stayed with a noble patron of his own and entertained his court with his songs. Court songs could be used not only as entertainment but also as propaganda, praising the patron, mocking his enemies, encouraging his wars, teaching ethics and etiquette, and maintaining religious unity.

The court was not the only venue for troubadour performance. Competitions were held from an early date. According to the &quot;vida&quot; of the Monge de Montaudon, he received a sparrow hawk, a prized hunting bird, for his poetry from the &quot;cour du Puy&quot;, some sort of poetry society associated with the court of Alfonso II of Aragon. The most famous contests were held in the twilight of the troubadours in the 14th and 15th centuries. The &quot;jocs florals&quot; held by the Consistori del Gay Saber at Toulouse, by Peter IV of Aragon at Lleida, and the Consistori de la Gaya Sciència at Barcelona awarded floral prizes to the best poetry in various categories, judging it by its accordance with a code called the &quot;Leys d&#x27;amors&quot;.

Troubadour songs are still performed and recorded today, albeit rarely.
===Music===
Troubadour songs were usually monophonic. Fewer than 300 melodies out of an estimated 2500 survive. Most were composed by the troubadours themselves. Some were set to pre-existing pieces of music. Raimbaut de Vaqueyras wrote his &quot;Kalenda maya&quot; (&quot;The Calends of May&quot;) to music composed by jongleurs at Montferrat.

===Grammars and dictionaries===
Beginning in the early 13th century, the spread of Occitan verse demanded grammars and dictionaries, especially for those whose native tongue was not Occitan, such as the Catalan and Italian troubadours, and their imitators. The production of such works only increased with the academisation of the troubadour lyric in the 14th century.
==Legacy==
===Transmission===
Some 2,600 poems or fragments of poems have survived from around 450 identifiable troubadours. They are largely preserved in songbooks called &quot;chansonniers&quot; made for wealthy patrons.

Troubadour songs are generally referred to by their incipits, that is, their opening lines. If this is long, or after it has already been mentioned, an abbreviation of the incipit may be used for convenience. A few troubadour songs are known by &quot;nicknames&quot;, thus &quot;D&#x27;un sirventes far&quot; by Guilhem Figueira is commonly called the &quot;Sirventes contra Roma&quot;. When a writer seeks to avoid using unglossed Occitan, the incipit of the song may be given in translation instead or a title may even be invented to reflect the theme of the work. Especially in translations designed for a popular audience, such as Ezra Pound&#x27;s, English titles are commonly invented by the translator/editor. There are examples, however, of troubadour songs given Occitan titles in the manuscripts, such as an anonymous &quot;pastorela&quot; that begins &quot;Mentre per una ribeira&quot;, which is entitled &quot;Porquieira&quot;.

===Table of chansonniers===
The number of Occitan parchment chansonniers given as extant varies between authors, depending on how they treat fragmentary and multilingual manuscripts. Conventionally, fragments are classified as fragments of the surviving chansonnier they most closely resemble and not as chansonniers in their own right. Some chansonniers have received both Occitan and French letters: troubadour D is trouvère H, W is M and X is U. The lettering (&quot;siglas&quot;) was introduced by Karl Bartsch, who placed sources he considered more reliable higher in the alphabet. This system is imperfect, however, since many of the chansonniers produced for an Italian audience are heavily edited and do not necessarily more closely resemble the original compositions. While parchment chansonniers are more durable, paper ones also exist and have received lower-case &quot;siglas&quot;.

<text>Bacteriocins are proteinaceous or peptidic toxins produced by bacteria to inhibit the growth of similar or closely related bacterial strain(s). They are similar to yeast and paramecium killing factors, and are structurally, functionally, and ecologically diverse. Applications of bacteriocins are being tested to assess their application as narrow-spectrum antibiotics.

Bacteriocins were first discovered by André Gratia in 1925. He was involved in the process of searching for ways to kill bacteria, which also resulted in the development of antibiotics and the discovery of bacteriophage, all within a span of a few years. He called his first discovery a &quot;colicine&quot; because it was made by &quot;E. coli.&quot;

== Classification ==
Bacteriocins are categorized in several ways, including producing strain, common resistance mechanisms, and mechanism of killing. There are several large categories of bacteriocin which are only phenomenologically related. These include the bacteriocins from gram-positive bacteria, the colicins, the microcins, and the bacteriocins from Archaea. The bacteriocins from &quot;E. coli&quot; are called &quot;colicins&quot; (formerly called &#x27;colicines&#x27;, meaning &#x27;coli killers&#x27;). These are the longest studied bacteriocins. They are a diverse group of bacteriocins and do not include all the bacteriocins produced by &quot;E. coli.&quot; In fact, one of the oldest known so-called colicins was called &quot;colicin V&quot; and is now known as &quot;microcin V&quot;. It is much smaller and produced and secreted in a different manner than the classic colicins.

This naming system is problematic for a number of reasons. First, naming bacteriocins by what they putatively kill would be more accurate if their killing spectrum were contiguous with genus or species designations. The bacteriocins frequently possess spectra that exceed the bounds of their named taxa and almost never kill the majority of the taxa for which they are named. Further, the original naming is generally derived not from the sensitive strain the bacteriocin kills, but instead the organism that produces the bacteriocin. This makes the use of this naming system a problematic basis for theory; thus the alternative classification systems.

Bacteriocins that contain the modified amino acid lanthionine as part of their structure are called lantibiotics. However, efforts to reorganize the nomenclature of the family of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide (RiPP) natural products have led to the differentiation of lantipeptides from bacteriocins based on biosynthetic genes.

===Methods of classification===
Alternative methods of classification include: method of killing (pore-forming, nuclease activity, peptidoglycan production inhibition, etc.), genetics (large plasmids, small plasmids, chromosomal), molecular weight and chemistry (large protein, peptide, with/without sugar moiety, containing atypical amino acids such as lanthionine), and method of production (ribosomal, post-ribosomal modifications, non-ribosomal).

===From Gram negative bacteria===

Gram negative bacteriocins are typically classified by size. Microcins are less than 20 kDa in size, colicin-like bacteriocins are 20 to 90 kDa in size and tailocins or so called high molecular weight bacteriocins which are multi subunit bacteriocins that resemble the tails of bacteriophages. This size classification also coincides with genetic, structural and functional similarities.

====Microcins====
See main article on microcins.

====Colicin-like bacteriocins====
Colicins are bacteriocins found in the Gram-negative &quot;E. coli&quot;. Similar bacteriocins (CLBs, colicin-like bacteriocins) occur in other Gram-negative bacteria. CLBs typically target same species and have species-specific names: klebicins from &quot;Klebsiella&quot; and pesticins from &quot;Yersia pestis&quot;. &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; -genus produces bacteriocins called pyocins. S-type pyocins belong to CLBs, but R- and F-type pyocins belong to tailocins.

CLBs are distinct from Gram-positive bacteriocins. They are modular proteins between 20 and 90 kDa in size. They often consist of a receptor binding domain, a translocation domain and a cytotoxic domain. Combinations of these domains between different CLBs occur frequently in nature and can be created in the laboratory. Due to these combinations further subclassification can be based on either import mechanism (group A and B) or on cytotoxic mechanism (nucleases, pore forming, M-type, L-type).

====Tailocins====
Most well studied are the tailocins of &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;. They can be further subdivided into R-type and F-type pyocins.
Some research was made to identify the pyocins and show how they are involved in the “cell-to-cell” competition of the closely related Pseudomonas bacteria.

The two types of tailocins differ by their structure; they are both composed of a sheath and a hollow tube forming a long helicoidal hexameric structure attached to a baseplate. There are multiple tail fibers that allow the viral particle to bind to the target cell. However, the R-pyocins are a large, rigid contractile tail-like structure whereas the F-pyocins are a small flexible, non-contractile tail-like structure.

The tailocins are coded by prophage sequences in the bacteria genome, and the production will happen when kin bacteria are spotted in the environment of the producer. 
The particles are synthesized in the center of the cells and after maturation they will migrate to the cell pole via tubulin structure. The tailocins will then be ejected in the medium with the cell lysis. They can be projected up to several tens of micrometers thanks to a very high turgor pressure of the cell. The tailocins released will then recognize and bind to the kin bacteria to kill them.

===From Gram positive bacteria===

Bacteriocins from Gram positive bacteria are typically classified into Class I, Class IIa/b/c, and Class III.
====Class I bacteriocins====
The class I bacteriocins are small peptide inhibitors and include nisin and other lantibiotics.

====Class II bacteriocins====
The class II bacteriocins are small (&lt;10 kDa) heat-stable proteins. This class is subdivided into five subclasses. The class IIa bacteriocins (pediocin-like bacteriocins) are the largest subgroup and contain an N-terminal consensus sequence -Tyr-Gly-Asn-Gly-Val-Xaa-Cys across this group. The C-terminal is responsible for species-specific activity, causing cell-leakage by permeabilizing the target cell wall.

:Class IIa bacteriocins have a large potential for use in food preservation as well medical applications due to their strong anti-&quot;Listeria&quot; activity and broad range of activity. One example of Class IIa bacteriocin is &quot;pediocin PA-1&quot;.
:The class IIb bacteriocins (two-peptide bacteriocins) require two different peptides for activity. One such an example is &quot;lactococcin G&quot;, which permeabilizes cell membranes for monovalent sodium and potassium cations, but not for divalent cations. Almost all of these bacteriocins have a GxxxG motifs. This motif is also found in transmembrane proteins, where they are involved in helix-helix interactions. Accordingly, the bacteriocin GxxxG motifs can interact with the motifs in the membranes of the bacterial cells, killing the cells.
:Class IIc encompasses cyclic peptides, in which the N-terminal and C-terminal regions are covalentely linked. &quot;Enterocin AS-48&quot; is the prototype of this group.
:Class IId cover single-peptide bacteriocins, which are not post-translationally modified and do not show the pediocin-like signature. The best example of this group is the highly stable &quot;aureocin A53&quot;. This bacteriocin is stable under highly acidic conditions, high temperatures, and is not affected by proteases.

The most recently proposed subclass is the Class IIe, which encompasses those bacteriocins composed of three or four non-pediocin like peptides. The best example is &quot;aureocin A70&quot;, a four-peptide bacteriocin, highly active against &quot;Listeria monocytogenes&quot;, with potential biotechnological applications. Recent work has identified that these bacteriocins are widespread across the bacterial domain and are present in the phylum Actinomycetota. 

====Class III bacteriocins====
Class III bacteriocins are large, heat-labile (&gt;10 kDa) protein bacteriocins. This class is subdivided in two subclasses: subclass IIIa (bacteriolysins) and subclass IIIb. 
Subclass IIIa comprises those peptides that kill bacterial cells by cell wall degradation, thus causing cell lysis. The best studied bacteriolysin is lysostaphin, a 27 kDa peptide that hydrolyzes the cell walls of several &quot;Staphylococcus&quot; species, principally &quot;S. aureus&quot;. Subclass IIIb, in contrast, comprises those peptides that do not cause cell lysis, killing the target cells by disrupting plasma membrane potential.

====Class IV bacteriocins====
Class IV bacteriocins are defined as complex bacteriocins containing lipid or carbohydrate moieties. 
Confirmation by experimental data was established with the characterisation of sublancin and glycocin F (GccF) by two independent groups.

===Databases===
Two databases of bacteriocins are available: BAGEL and BACTIBASE.

==Uses==
As of 2016, nisin was the only bacteriocin generally recognized as safe by the FDA and was used as a food preservative in several countries. Generally bacteriocins are not useful as food preservatives because they are expensive to make, are broken down in food products, they harm some proteins in food, and they target too narrow a range of microbes.

Furthermore, bacteriocins active against &quot;E. coli&quot;, &quot;Salmonella&quot; and &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; have been produced in plants with the aim for them to be used as food additives. The use of bacteriocins in food has been generally regarded as safe by the FDA.

Moreover, has been recently demonstrated that bacteriocins active against plant pathogenic bacteria can be expressed in plants to provide robust resistance against plant disease.

==Relevance to human health==
Bacteriocins are made by non-pathogenic &quot;Lactobacilli&quot; in the vagina and help maintain the stability of the vaginal microbiome.

==Research==
Bacteriocins have been proposed as a replacement for antibiotics to which pathogenic bacteria have become resistant. Potentially, the bacteriocins could be produced by bacteria intentionally introduced into the patient to combat infection. There are several strategies by which new bacteriocins can be discovered. In the past, bacteriocins had to be identified by intensive culture-based screening for antimicrobial activity against suitable targets and subsequently purified using fastidious methods prior to testing. However, since the advent of the genomic era, the availability of the bacterial genome sequences has revolutionized the approach to identifying bacteriocins. Recently developed &quot;in silico&quot;-based methods can be applied to rapidly screen thousands of bacterial genomes in order to identify novel antimicrobial peptides.

As of 2014 some bacteriocins had been studied in &quot;in vitro&quot; studies to see if they can stop viruses from replicating, namely staphylococcin 188 against Newcastle disease virus, influenza virus, and coliphage HSA virus; each of enterocin AAR-71 class IIa, enterocin AAR-74 class IIa, and erwiniocin NA4 against coliphage HSA virus; each of enterocin ST5Ha, enterocin NKR-5-3C, and subtilosin against HSV-1; each of enterocin ST4V and enterocin CRL35 class IIa against HSV-1 and HSV-2; labyrinthopeptin A1 against HIV-1 and HSV-1; and bacteriocin from &quot;Lactobacillus delbrueckii&quot; against influenza virus.

As of 2009, some bacteriocins, cytolysin, pyocin S2, colicins A and E1, and the microcin MccE492 had been tested on eukaryotic cell lines and in a mouse model of cancer.
