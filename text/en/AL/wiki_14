<text>On February 3, 1959, American rock and roll musicians Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and &quot;The Big Bopper&quot; J. P. Richardson were all killed in a plane crash near Clear Lake, Iowa, together with pilot Roger Peterson. The event became known as &quot;The Day the Music Died&quot; after singer-songwriter Don McLean referred to it as such in his 1971 song &quot;American Pie&quot;.

At the time, Holly and his band, consisting of Waylon Jennings, Tommy Allsup, and Carl Bunch, were playing on the &quot;Winter Dance Party&quot; tour across the American Midwest. Rising artists Valens, Richardson and vocal group Dion and the Belmonts had joined the tour as well. The long journeys between venues on board the cold, uncomfortable tour buses adversely affected the performers, with cases of flu and even frostbite.

After stopping at Clear Lake to perform, and frustrated by the conditions on the tour buses, Holly chose to charter a plane to reach their next venue in Moorhead, Minnesota. Richardson, suffering from flu, swapped places with Jennings, taking his seat on the plane, while Allsup lost his seat to Valens on a coin toss. Soon after takeoff, late at night and in poor, wintry weather conditions, pilot Peterson lost control of the light aircraft, a Beechcraft Bonanza, which crashed into a cornfield, killing all four on board.

The event has since been mentioned or referenced in various media. Various monuments have been erected at the crash site and in Clear Lake, where an annual memorial concert is held at the Surf Ballroom, the venue that hosted the artists&#x27; last performances.

==Background==
In November 1958, Buddy Holly terminated his association with The Crickets. According to Paul Anka, Holly realized he needed to go back on tour again for two reasons: he needed cash because the Crickets&#x27; manager Norman Petty had apparently stolen money from him, and he wanted to raise funds to move to New York City to live with his new wife, María Elena Holly, who was pregnant (although he already lived in New York when he started the tour). Holly signed up with General Artists Corporation (GAC) because &quot;he knew they were planning a British tour and he wanted to be in on that.&quot;

For the start of the &quot;Winter Dance Party&quot; tour, Holly assembled a band consisting of Waylon Jennings (bass), Tommy Allsup (guitar) and Carl Bunch (drums), with the opening vocals of Frankie Sardo. The tour was set to cover twenty-four Midwestern cities in as many daysthere were no off days. New hit artist Ritchie Valens, &quot;The Big Bopper&quot; J. P. Richardson and the vocal group Dion and the Belmonts joined the tour to promote their recordings and make an extra profit.
The tour began in Milwaukee on January 23, 1959, with the performance in Clear Lake, Iowa on February 2 being the eleventh of the twenty-four scheduled events. The amount of travel required soon posed a serious problem. The distances between venues had not been properly considered when the performances were scheduled. Instead of systematically circling around the Midwest through a series of venues in close proximity to one another, the tour erratically zigzagged back and forth across the region, with distances between some tour stops exceeding . As there were no off days, the bands had to travel most of each day, frequently for ten to twelve hours in freezing mid-winter temperatures. Most of the Interstate Highway System had not yet been built, so the routes between tour stops required far more driving time on narrow two-lane rural highways than would now be the case on modern expressways.

GAC, which booked the tour, received considerable criticism for their seemingly total disregard for the conditions they forced the touring musicians to endure:

The entire company of musicians traveled together in one bus, although the buses used for the tour were wholly inadequate, breaking down and being replaced frequently. Griggs estimates that five separate buses were used in the first eleven days of the tour—&quot;reconditioned school buses, not good enough for school kids.&quot; The artists themselves were responsible for loading and unloading equipment at each stop, as no road crew assisted them. Adding to the disarray, the buses were not equipped for the harsh weather, which consisted of waist-deep snow in several areas and varying temperatures from to as low as . One bus had a heating system that malfunctioned shortly after the tour began in Appleton, Wisconsin.
Richardson and Valens began experiencing flu-like symptoms, and drummer Bunch was hospitalized for severely frostbitten feet, after the tour bus stalled in the middle of the highway in subzero temperatures near Ironwood, Michigan. The musicians replaced that bus with another school bus and kept traveling. As Holly&#x27;s group had been the backing band for all of the acts, Holly, Valens and DiMucci (and Carlo Mastrangelo of the Belmonts who was a drummer) took turns playing drums for each other at the performances in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and Clear Lake, Iowa, with Holly playing drums for Dion, Dion playing drums for Ritchie, and Ritchie playing drums for Holly.

On Monday, February 2, the tour arrived in Clear Lake, west of Mason City, Iowa, having driven from the previous day&#x27;s concert in Green Bay. Clear Lake had not been a scheduled stop; tour promoters hoped to fill the open date and called Carroll Anderson, the manager of the local Surf Ballroom, and offered him the show. Anderson accepted and they set the show for that night. By the time Holly arrived at the venue that evening, he was frustrated with the ongoing problems with the bus. The next scheduled destination after Clear Lake was Moorhead, Minnesota, a drive north-northwest—and, as a reflection of the poor quality of the tour planning, a journey that would have taken them directly back through the two towns they had already played within the last week. No respite was in sight after that, as the following day, after having traveled from Iowa to Minnesota, they were scheduled to travel back to Iowa, specifically almost directly south to Sioux City, a trip.

Holly chartered a plane to fly himself and his band to Fargo, North Dakota, which is adjacent to Moorhead. The rest of the party would have picked him up in Moorhead, saving him the journey in the bus and leaving him time to get some rest. Their gig in Moorhead was to have been a radio performance at the station KFGO with disc jockey Charlie Boone.

==Flight arrangements==
Anderson chartered a plane from Dwyer Flying Service in Mason City, to fly to Fargo&#x27;s Hector Airport, the closest airport to Moorhead; the pilot was Roger Peterson, a 21-year-old married man who had &quot;built his life around flying&quot;.

Dwyer Flying Service charged a fee of $36 () per passenger for the flight on the 1947 single-engined, V-tailed Beechcraft 35 Bonanza (registration ), which seated three passengers and the pilot. A popular misconception, originating from Don McLean&#x27;s song about the crash, was that the plane was called &quot;American Pie&quot;; no record exists of any name ever having been given to N3794N.

The most widely accepted version of events was that Richardson had contracted the flu during the tour and asked Jennings for his seat on the plane. When Holly learned that Jennings was not going to fly, he said in jest: &quot;Well, I hope your damned bus freezes up.&quot; Jennings responded: &quot;Well, I hope your ol&#x27; plane crashes&quot;, a humorous but ill-fated response that would haunt Jennings for the rest of his life. Valens, who once had a fear of flying, asked Allsup for his seat on the plane. The two agreed to toss a coin to decide. Bob Hale, a disc jockey with Mason City&#x27;s KRIB-AM, was emceeing the concert that night and flipped the coin in the ballroom&#x27;s side-stage room shortly before the musicians departed for the airport. Valens won the coin toss for the seat on the flight. Valens is apocryphally said to have remarked, &quot;That&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever won anything in my life.&quot;

In contradiction to the testimony of Allsup and Jennings, Dion has since said that Holly approached him along with Valens and Richardson to join the flight, not Holly&#x27;s bandmates. In a 2009 interview, Dion said that Holly called him, Valens and Richardson into a vacant dressing room during Sardo&#x27;s performance and said, &quot;I&#x27;ve chartered a plane, we&#x27;re the guys making the money [we should be the ones flying ahead]...the only problem is there are only two available seats.&quot; According to Dion, it was Valens, not Richardson, who had fallen ill, so Valens and Dion flipped a coin for the seat. In his interview, no mention is made of Jennings or Allsup being invited on the plane. Dion said he won the toss, but ultimately decided that since the $36 fare equaled the monthly rent his parents paid for his childhood apartment, he could not justify the indulgence.

==Take-off and crash==

After the show ended, Anderson drove Holly, Valens and Richardson to nearby Mason City Municipal Airport, where the elevation is AMSL. The weather at the time of departure was reported as light snow, a ceiling of AMSL with sky obscured, visibility and winds from . Although deteriorating weather was reported along the planned route, the weather briefings Peterson received failed to relay the information.

The plane took off normally from runway 17 (today&#x27;s runway 18) at 00:55 (12:55 am) CST on Tuesday, February 3. Hubert Jerry Dwyer, owner of the flying service, watched the southbound take-off from a platform outside the control tower. He was able to clearly see the aircraft&#x27;s tail light for most of the brief flight, which started with an initial 180 degree left turn to pass east of the airport, climbing to approximately AGL. After an additional left turn to a northwesterly heading, the tail light was observed gradually descending until it disappeared. Around 1am, when Peterson failed to make the expected radio contact, repeated attempts were made to establish radio contact, without success. Later that morning at daylight, after several attempts to contact the plane were unsuccessful, Dwyer retraced Peterson&#x27;s planned route by air, and around 9:35 am he spotted the wreckage less than northwest of the airport.

The Bonanza had impacted terrain at high speed, estimated to have been around , banked 90° to the right and in a nose-down attitude. The right-wing tip struck the ground first, gouging a furrow, crumpling then breaking off. The fuselage then hit the ground right-side down and bounced a few feet back into the air, traveling another through the air, simultaneously rolling inverted due to the remaining left wing still generating lift. The plane struck the ground a final time, in an inverted, nose-down position, the nose hitting and flipping the plane over into a right-side up, tail-first position. The momentum of the heavy engine caused the fuselage, left wing remaining attached and intact to the end, to roll upon itself into a virtual ball, rolling nose-over-tail across the frozen field for , before coming to rest tail-first against a wire fence. The bodies of the performers had been ejected from the fuselage and lay near the plane&#x27;s wreckage, while Peterson&#x27;s body, which was entangled in the wreckage, could only be retrieved after the cockpit was cut open using blowtorches. With the rest of the entourage en route to Minnesota, Anderson, who had driven the party to the airport and witnessed the plane&#x27;s takeoff, had to identify the bodies of the musicians. The county coroner, Ralph Smiley, reported that all four victims died instantly, the cause of death being &quot;gross trauma to brain&quot; for the three musicians and &quot;brain damage&quot; for the pilot.

==Aftermath==

María Elena Holly learned of her husband&#x27;s death via a television news report. A widow after only six months of marriage, she suffered a miscarriage shortly after, reportedly due to &quot;psychological trauma&quot;. Holly&#x27;s mother, on hearing the news on the radio at home in Lubbock, Texas, screamed and collapsed.

Despite the tragedy, the &quot;Winter Dance Party&quot; tour continued. Fifteen-year-old Bobby Vee was given the task of filling in for Holly at the next scheduled performance in Moorhead, in part because he &quot;knew all the words to all the songs.&quot; Jennings and Allsup carried on for two more weeks, with Jennings taking Holly&#x27;s place as lead singer. Other performers who were recruited for the remainder of the tour were Jimmy Clanton, Fabian and Frankie Avalon.

Meanwhile, funerals for the victims were held individually. Holly and Richardson were buried in Texas, Valens in California and Peterson in Iowa. Holly&#x27;s widow, María Elena, did not attend his funeral. She said in an interview: &quot;In a way, I blame myself. I was not feeling well when he left. I was two weeks pregnant, and I wanted Buddy to stay with me, but he had scheduled that tour. It was the only time I wasn&#x27;t with him. And I blame myself because I know that, if only I had gone along, Buddy never would have gotten into that airplane.&quot;

==Official investigation==
The official investigation was carried out by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB, precursor to the NTSB). It emerged that Peterson had over four years of flying experience, of which one was with Dwyer Flying Service, and had accumulated 711 flying hours, of which 128 were on Bonanzas. He had also logged 52 hours of instrument flight training, although he had passed only his written examination, and was not yet qualified to operate in weather that required flying solely by reference to instruments. Peterson and Dwyer Flying Service itself were certified to operate only under visual flight rules, which essentially require that the pilot must be able to see where the aircraft is going. On the night of the accident visual flight would have been virtually impossible due to the low clouds, the lack of a visible horizon and the absence of ground lights over the sparsely populated area.
Furthermore, Peterson, who had failed an instrument checkride nine months before the accident, had received his instrument training on airplanes equipped with a conventional artificial horizon as a source of aircraft attitude information, while the accident aircraft was equipped with an older-type Sperry F3 attitude gyroscope. Crucially, the two types of instruments display the same aircraft pitch attitude information in graphically opposite ways. As a result, when the aircraft took off, Peterson, observing the older model Sperry F3 gyroscope, thought he was climbing when in fact he was descending.

Another contributing factor was the &quot;seriously inadequate&quot; nighttime weather briefing provided to Peterson, which &quot;failed to even mention adverse flying conditions which should have been highlighted&quot;. The CAB concluded that the probable cause of the accident was &quot;the pilot&#x27;s unwise decision&quot; to attempt a flight at night that required skills he did not have.

==Subsequent investigations==
On March 6, 2007, in Beaumont, Texas, Richardson&#x27;s body was exhumed for reburial. Forest Lawn Cemetery moved his body to a more suitable area after plans were made to erect a bronze statue near his gravesite to accompany a newly received historical marker. As the body was to be placed in a new casket while above ground, the musician&#x27;s son, Jay Perry Richardson, took the opportunity to have his father&#x27;s body re-examined to verify the original coroner&#x27;s findings and asked forensic anthropologist William M. Bass to carry out the procedure.

A longstanding rumor surrounding the accident, which this re-examination sought to confirm or dispel, asserted that an accidental firearm discharge took place on board the aircraft and caused the crash. It had also been speculated that Richardson initially survived the crash and crawled out of the wreckage in search of help before succumbing to his injuries, prompted by the fact that his body was found farther from the plane than the other victims. Bass and his team took several X-rays of Richardson&#x27;s body and eventually concluded that the musician had indeed died instantly from extensive, unsurvivable fractures to virtually every bone in his body. No traces of lead were found from any bullet, nor any indication that he had been shot. Coroner Smiley&#x27;s original 1959 report was, therefore, confirmed as accurate.

In March 2015, the NTSB received a request to reopen the investigation into the accident. The request was made by L. J. Coon, a retired pilot from New England who felt that the conclusion of the 1959 investigation was inaccurate. Coon suspected a possible failure of the right ruddervator, or a problem with the fuel system, as well as possible improper weight distribution. Coon argued that Peterson may have tried to land the plane and that his efforts should be recognized. The NTSB declined the request in April 2015, saying that the evidence presented by Coon was insufficient to merit the reconsideration of the original findings.

==Legacy==
=== Policies ===
A policy not to report on a person&#x27;s death until their family had been notified was implemented by authorities in the months after María Elena Holly suffered her miscarriage due to the psychological trauma of hearing about her husband&#x27;s death on television for the first time.

=== Memorials ===
A memorial service for Peterson was held at Redeemer Lutheran Church in Ventura, Iowa, on February 5. A funeral was held the next day at St. Paul Lutheran Church in his hometown of Alta; Peterson was buried in Buena Vista Memorial Cemetery in nearby Storm Lake.

=== Films ===
* The accident closes the biographical film &quot;The Buddy Holly Story&quot; (1978); the film ends as the Clear Lake concert concludes, and a freeze-frame shot is followed with a caption revealing their deaths later that night &quot;...and the rest is Rock &#x27;N Roll.&quot;
* The run-up to the accident (which happens entirely off-camera) and its aftermath, particularly the reactions of Ritchie Valens&#x27; immediate family and loved ones, are depicted in the Valens biopic &quot;La Bamba&quot; (1987).

=== Memorial concerts ===
Fans of Holly, Valens, and Richardson have been gathering for annual memorial concerts at the Surf Ballroom in Clear Lake since 1979. The fiftieth anniversary concert took place on February 2, 2009, with Delbert McClinton, Joe Ely, Wanda Jackson, Los Lobos, Chris Montez, Bobby Vee, Graham Nash, Peter and Gordon, Tommy Allsup, and a house band featuring Chuck Leavell, James &quot;Hutch&quot; Hutchinson, Bobby Keys, and Kenny Aronoff. Jay Perry Richardson, the son of the Big Bopper, was among the participating artists, and Bob Hale was the master of ceremonies, as he was at the 1959 concert.

=== Monuments ===
In June 1988, a tall granite memorial bearing the names of Peterson and the three entertainers was dedicated outside the Surf Ballroom with Peterson&#x27;s widow, parents, and sister in attendance; the event marked the first time that the families of Holly, Richardson, Valens, and Peterson had gathered together.

In 1989, Ken Paquette, a Wisconsin fan of the 1950s era, made a stainless-steel monument that depicts a guitar and a set of three records bearing the names of the three performers killed in the accident. The monument is on private farmland, about west of the intersection of 315th Street and Gull Avenue, north of Clear Lake. At that intersection, a large plasma-cut steel set of Wayfarer-style glasses, similar to those Holly wore, marks the access point to the crash site.

Paquette created a similar stainless-steel monument to the three musicians located outside the Riverside Ballroom in Green Bay, Wisconsin, where Holly, Richardson, and Valens played their penultimate show on February 1. This second memorial was unveiled on July 17, 2003. In February 2009, a further memorial made by Paquette for Peterson was unveiled at the crash site.

=== Roads ===
A road originating near the Surf Ballroom, extending north and passing to the west of the crash site, is now known as Buddy Holly Place.

=== Songs ===

* Tommy Dee recorded &quot;Three Stars&quot; (1959), commemorating the musicians.
* In 1961, Mike Berry recorded &quot;Tribute to Buddy Holly&quot;, which describes the night of the flight. It reached number 24 on the UK Singles Chart and was notoriously banned by the BBC for being &quot;too morbid&quot;.
* Don McLean, a fan of Buddy Holly, addressed the accident in his song &quot;American Pie&quot; (1971), dubbing it &quot;the Day the Music Died&quot;, which for McLean symbolized the &quot;loss of innocence&quot; of the early rock-and-roll generation.
* In 1978, Waylon Jennings briefly added his own memories of the incident onto his song &quot;A Long Time Ago&quot;, from the album &quot;I&#x27;ve Always Been Crazy&quot;. He sings the lines &quot;Don&#x27;t ask me who I gave my seat to on that plane, I think you already know, I told you that a long time ago.&quot;
* Dion recorded &quot;Hug My Radiator&quot; which references the &quot;broken-down bus&quot; and the chilling cold the performers experienced on the tour. The song does not directly reference the three performers who died, but Dion has said, in interviews, that the song is a memory of the tour and that he almost got on the airplane that crashed, but it was too expensive.
* In 1985, German punk rock band Die Ärzte released their second album &quot;Im Schatten der Ärzte&quot;, which includes the song &quot;Buddy Holly&#x27;s Brille&quot;. In their trademark humorous fashion, they treat the accident by asking where Holly&#x27;s glasses ended up.

=== Fiction ===
Howard Waldrop&#x27;s short story &quot;Save a Place in the Lifeboat for Me&quot; (collected in &quot;Howard Who?&quot;) describes a fictional attempt by a sextet of famous slapstick characters (Chico and Harpo Marx, Abbott and Costello, and Laurel and Hardy) to prevent the accident from occurring.

TJ Klune&#x27;s 2020 fantasy novel &quot;The House in the Cerulean Sea&quot; features an orphaned antichrist, Lucy, who collects records of Holly, the Big Bopper, and Valens, and discusses the crash with the protagonist, Linus.

<text>The Austronesian languages ( ) are a language family widely spoken throughout Maritime Southeast Asia, parts of Mainland Southeast Asia, Madagascar, the islands of the Pacific Ocean and Taiwan (by Taiwanese indigenous peoples). They are spoken by about 328 million people (4.4% of the world population). This makes it the fifth-largest language family by number of speakers. Major Austronesian languages include Malay (around 250–270 million in Indonesia alone in its own literary standard named &quot;Indonesian&quot;), Javanese, Sundanese, Tagalog (standardized as Filipino), Malagasy and Cebuano. According to some estimates, the family contains 1,257 languages, which is the second most of any language family.

In 1706, the Dutch scholar Adriaan Reland first observed similarities between the languages spoken in the Malay Archipelago and by peoples on islands in the Pacific Ocean. In the 19th century, researchers (e.g. Wilhelm von Humboldt, Herman van der Tuuk) started to apply the comparative method to the Austronesian languages. The first extensive study on the history of the phonology was made by the German linguist Otto Dempwolff. It included a reconstruction of the Proto-Austronesian lexicon. The term &quot;Austronesian&quot; was coined (as German &#x27;) by [[Wilhelm Schmidt (linguist)|Wilhelm Schmidt]], deriving it from [[Latin]]&#x27; &quot;south&quot; and Ancient Greek &quot;&quot; ( &quot;island&quot;), meaning the &quot;Southern Island languages&quot;.

Most Austronesian languages are spoken by the people of Insular Southeast Asia and Oceania. Only a few languages, such as Urak Lawoiʼ and the Chamic languages (except Acehnese), are indigenous to mainland Asia, or Malagasy which is the only Austronesian language indigenous to Insular East Africa. There are few Austronesian languages which have populations exceeding a few thousand, but a handful have speaking populations in the millions. For example, Indonesian is spoken by around 197.7 million people. This makes it the eleventh most-spoken language in the world. Approximately twenty Austronesian languages are official in their respective countries (see the list of major and official Austronesian languages).

By the number of languages they include, Austronesian and Niger–Congo are the two largest language families in the world. They each contain roughly one-fifth of the world&#x27;s languages. The geographical span of Austronesian was the largest of any language family in the first half of the second millennium CE, before the spread of Indo-European languages in the colonial period. It ranged from Madagascar to Easter Island in the eastern Pacific.

According to Robert Blust (1999), Austronesian is divided into several primary branches, all but one of which are found exclusively in Taiwan. The Formosan languages of Taiwan are grouped into as many as nine first-order subgroups of Austronesian. All Austronesian languages spoken outside the Taiwan mainland (including its offshore Yami language) belong to the Malayo-Polynesian (sometimes called &quot;Extra-Formosan&quot;) branch.

Most Austronesian languages lack a long history of written attestation. The oldest inscription in the Cham language, the Đông Yên Châu inscription dated to AD, is the first attestation of any Austronesian language.

==Typological characteristics==
===Phonology===
The Austronesian languages overall possess phoneme inventories which are smaller than the world average. Around 90% of the Austronesian languages have inventories of 19–25 sounds (15–20 consonants and 4–5 vowels), thus lying at the lower end of the global typical range of 20–37 sounds. However, extreme inventories are also found, such as Nemi (New Caledonia) with 43 consonants.

The canonical root type in Proto-Austronesian is disyllabic with the shape CV(C)CVC (C = consonant; V = vowel), and is still found in many Austronesian languages. In most languages, consonant clusters are only allowed in medial position, and often, there are restrictions for the first element of the cluster. There is a common drift to reduce the number of consonants which can appear in final position, e.g. Buginese, which only allows the two consonants /ŋ/ and /ʔ/ as finals, out of a total number of 18 consonants. Complete absence of final consonants is observed e.g. in Nias, Malagasy and many Oceanic languages.

Tonal contrasts are rare in Austronesian languages, although Moken–Moklen and a few languages of the Chamic, South Halmahera–West New Guinea and New Caledonian subgroups do show lexical tone.

===Morphology===
Most Austronesian languages are agglutinative languages with a relatively high number of affixes, and clear morpheme boundaries. Most affixes are prefixes (Malay and Indonesian &quot;ber-jalan&quot; &#x27;walk&#x27; &lt; &quot;jalan&quot; &#x27;road&#x27;), with a smaller number of suffixes (Tagalog &quot;titis-án&quot; &#x27;ashtray&#x27; &lt; &quot;títis&quot; &#x27;ash&#x27;) and infixes (Roviana &quot;t&lt;in&gt;avete&quot; &#x27;work (noun)&#x27; &lt; &quot;tavete&quot; &#x27;work (verb)&#x27;).

Reduplication is commonly employed in Austronesian languages. This includes full reduplication (Malay and Indonesian &quot;anak-anak&quot; &#x27;children&#x27; &lt; &quot;anak&quot; &#x27;child&#x27;; Karo Batak &quot;nipe-nipe&quot; &#x27;caterpillar&#x27; &lt; &quot;nipe&quot; &#x27;snake&#x27;) or partial reduplication (Agta &quot;taktakki&quot; &#x27;legs&#x27; &lt; &quot;takki&quot; &#x27;leg&#x27;, &quot;at-atu&quot; &#x27;puppy&#x27; &lt; &quot;atu&quot; &#x27;dog&#x27;).

===Syntax===

It is difficult to make generalizations about the languages that make up a family as diverse as Austronesian. Very broadly, one can divide the Austronesian languages into three groups: Philippine-type languages, Indonesian-type languages and post-Indonesian type languages:
* The first group includes, besides the languages of the Philippines, the Austronesian languages of Taiwan, Sabah, North Sulawesi and Madagascar. It is primarily characterized by the retention of the original system of Philippine-type voice alternations, where typically three or four verb voices determine which semantic role the &quot;subject&quot;/&quot;topic&quot; expresses (it may express either the actor, the patient, the location and the beneficiary, or various other circumstantial roles such as instrument and concomitant). The phenomenon has frequently been referred to as &quot;focus&quot; (not to be confused with the usual sense of that term in linguistics). Furthermore, the choice of voice is influenced by the definiteness of the participants. The word order has a strong tendency to be verb-initial.
* In contrast, the more innovative Indonesian-type languages, which are particularly represented in Malaysia and western Indonesia, have reduced the voice system to a contrast between only two voices (actor voice and &quot;undergoer&quot; voice), but these are supplemented by applicative morphological devices (originally two: the more direct *&quot;-i&quot; and more oblique *&quot;-an/-[a]kən&quot;), which serve to modify the semantic role of the &quot;undergoer&quot;. They are also characterized by the presence of preposed clitic pronouns. Unlike the Philippine type, these languages mostly tend towards verb-second word-orders. A number of languages, such as the Batak languages, Old Javanese, Balinese, Sasak and several Sulawesi languages seem to represent an intermediate stage between these two types.
* Finally, in some languages, which Ross calls &quot;post-Indonesian&quot;, the original voice system has broken down completely and the voice-marking affixes no longer preserve their functions.

==Lexicon==

The Austronesian language family has been established by the linguistic comparative method on the basis of cognate sets, sets of words from multiple languages, which are similar in sound and meaning which can be shown to be descended from the same ancestral word in Proto-Austronesian according to regular rules. Some cognate sets are very stable. The word for &quot;eye&quot; in many Austronesian languages is mata (from the most northerly Austronesian languages, Formosan languages such as Bunun and Amis all the way south to Māori).

Other words are harder to reconstruct. The word for &quot;two&quot; is also stable, in that it appears over the entire range of the Austronesian family, but the forms (e.g. Bunun dusa; Amis tusa; Māori rua) require some linguistic expertise to recognise. The Austronesian Basic Vocabulary Database gives word lists (coded for cognateness) for approximately 1000 Austronesian languages.

==Classification==

The internal structure of the Austronesian languages is complex. The family consists of many similar and closely related languages with large numbers of dialect continua, making it difficult to recognize boundaries between branches. The first major step towards high-order subgrouping was Dempwolff&#x27;s recognition of the Oceanic subgroup (called &quot;Melanesisch&quot; by Dempwolff). The special position of the languages of Taiwan was first recognized by André-Georges Haudricourt (1965), who divided the Austronesian languages into three subgroups: Northern Austronesian (= Formosan), Eastern Austronesian (= Oceanic), and Western Austronesian (all remaining languages).

In a study that represents the first lexicostatistical classification of the Austronesian languages, Isidore Dyen (1965) presented a radically different subgrouping scheme. He posited 40 first-order subgroups, with the highest degree of diversity found in the area of Melanesia. The Oceanic languages are not recognized, but are distributed over more than 30 of his proposed first-order subgroups. Dyen&#x27;s classification was widely criticized and for the most part rejected, but several of his lower-order subgroups are still accepted (e.g. the Cordilleran languages, the Bilic languages or the Murutic languages).

Subsequently, the position of the Formosan languages as the most archaic group of Austronesian languages was recognized by Otto Christian Dahl (1973), followed by proposals from other scholars that the Formosan languages actually make up more than one first-order subgroup of Austronesian. Robert Blust (1977) first presented the subgrouping model which is currently accepted by virtually all scholars in the field, with more than one first-order subgroup on Taiwan, and a single first-order branch encompassing all Austronesian languages spoken outside of Taiwan, viz. Malayo-Polynesian. The relationships of the Formosan languages to each other and the internal structure of Malayo-Polynesian continue to be debated.

===Primary branches on Taiwan (Formosan languages)===
In addition to Malayo-Polynesian, thirteen Formosan subgroups are broadly accepted. The seminal article in the classification of Formosan—and, by extension, the top-level structure of Austronesian—is . Prominent Formosanists (linguists who specialize in Formosan languages) take issue with some of its details, but it remains the point of reference for current linguistic analyses. Debate centers primarily around the relationships between these families. Of the classifications presented here, links two families into a Western Plains group, two more in a Northwestern Formosan group, and three into an Eastern Formosan group, while also links five families into a Northern Formosan group. Harvey (1982), Chang (2006) and Ross (2012) split Tsouic, and Blust (2013) agrees the group is probably not valid.

Other studies have presented phonological evidence for a reduced Paiwanic family of Paiwanic, Puyuma, Bunun, Amis, and Malayo-Polynesian, but this is not reflected in vocabulary. The Eastern Formosan peoples Basay, Kavalan, and Amis share a homeland motif that has them coming originally from an island called &quot;Sinasay&quot; or &quot;Sanasay&quot;. The Amis, in particular, maintain that they came from the east, and were treated by the Puyuma, amongst whom they settled, as a subservient group.

This classification retains Blust&#x27;s East Formosan, and unites the other northern languages. proposes a Proto-Formosan (F0) ancestor and equates it with Proto-Austronesian (PAN), following the model in Starosta (1995). Rukai and Tsouic are seen as highly divergent, although the position of Rukai is highly controversial.

==== (2004, 2021)====

Sagart (2004) proposes that the numerals of the Formosan languages reflect a nested series of innovations, from languages in the northwest (near the putative landfall of the Austronesian migration from the mainland), which share only the numerals 1–4 with proto-Malayo-Polynesian, counter-clockwise to the eastern languages (purple on map), which share all numerals 1–10. Sagart (2021) finds other shared innovations that follow the same pattern. He proposes that pMP *lima &#x27;five&#x27; is a lexical replacement (from &#x27;hand&#x27;), and that pMP *pitu &#x27;seven&#x27;, *walu &#x27;eight&#x27; and *Siwa &#x27;nine&#x27; are contractions of pAN *RaCep &#x27;five&#x27;, a ligature *a or *i &#x27;and&#x27;, and *duSa &#x27;two&#x27;, *telu &#x27;three&#x27;, *Sepat &#x27;four&#x27;, an analogical pattern historically attested from Pazeh. The fact that the Kradai languages share the numeral system (and other lexical innovations) of pMP suggests that they are a coordinate branch with Malayo-Polynesian, rather than a sister family to Austronesian.

Sagart&#x27;s resulting classification is:

********* Kra-Dai
********* Malayo-Polynesian
===Malayo-Polynesian===

The Malayo-Polynesian languages are—among other things—characterized by certain sound changes, such as the mergers of Proto-Austronesian (PAN) *t/*C to Proto-Malayo-Polynesian (PMP) *t, and PAN *n/*N to PMP *n, and the shift of PAN *S to PMP *h.

There appear to have been two great migrations of Austronesian languages that quickly covered large areas, resulting in multiple local groups with little large-scale structure. The first was Malayo-Polynesian, distributed across the Philippines, Indonesia, and Melanesia. The second migration was that of the Oceanic languages into Polynesia and Micronesia.

==Major languages==
==History==


From the standpoint of historical linguistics, the place of origin (in linguistic terminology, &quot;Urheimat&quot;) of the Austronesian languages (Proto-Austronesian language) is most likely the main island of Taiwan, also known as Formosa; on this island the deepest divisions in Austronesian are found along small geographic distances, among the families of the native Formosan languages.

According to Robert Blust, the Formosan languages form nine of the ten primary branches of the Austronesian language family. noted this when he wrote: ... the internal diversity among the... Formosan languages... is greater than that in all the rest of Austronesian put together, so there is a major genetic split within Austronesian between Formosan and the rest... Indeed, the genetic diversity within Formosan is so great that it may well consist of several primary branches of the overall Austronesian family.At least since , writing in 1949, linguists have generally accepted that the chronology of the dispersal of languages within a given language family can be traced from the area of greatest linguistic variety to that of the least. For example, English in North America has large numbers of speakers, but relatively low dialectal diversity, while English in Great Britain has much higher diversity; such low linguistic variety by Sapir&#x27;s thesis suggests a more recent spread of English in North America. While some scholars suspect that the number of principal branches among the Formosan languages may be somewhat less than Blust&#x27;s estimate of nine (e.g. ), there is little contention among linguists with this analysis and the resulting view of the origin and direction of the migration. For a recent dissenting analysis, see .

The protohistory of the Austronesian people can be traced farther back through time. To get an idea of the original homeland of the populations ancestral to the Austronesian peoples (as opposed to strictly linguistic arguments), evidence from archaeology and population genetics may be adduced. Studies from the science of genetics have produced conflicting outcomes. Some researchers find evidence for a proto-Austronesian homeland on the Asian mainland (e.g., ), while others mirror the linguistic research, rejecting an East Asian origin in favor of Taiwan (e.g., ). Archaeological evidence (e.g., ) is more consistent, suggesting that the ancestors of the Austronesians spread from the South Chinese mainland to Taiwan at some time around 8,000 years ago.

Evidence from historical linguistics suggests that it is from this island that seafaring peoples migrated, perhaps in distinct waves separated by millennia, to the entire region encompassed by the Austronesian languages. It is believed that this migration began around 6,000 years ago. However, evidence from historical linguistics cannot bridge the gap between those two periods. The view that linguistic evidence connects Austronesian languages to the Sino-Tibetan ones, as proposed for example by , is a minority one. As states:Implied in... discussions of subgrouping [of Austronesian languages] is a broad consensus that the homeland of the Austronesians was in Taiwan. This homeland area may have also included the P&#x27;eng-hu (Pescadores) islands between Taiwan and China and possibly even sites on the coast of mainland China, especially if one were to view the early Austronesians as a population of related dialect communities living in scattered coastal settlements.Linguistic analysis of the Proto-Austronesian language stops at the western shores of Taiwan; any related mainland language(s) have not survived. The only exceptions, the Chamic languages, derive from more recent migration to the mainland. However, according to Ostapirat&#x27;s interpretation of the seriously discussed Austro-Tai hypothesis, the Kra–Dai languages (also known as Tai–Kadai) are exactly those related mainland languages.

==Hypothesized relations==
Genealogical links have been proposed between Austronesian and various families of East and Southeast Asia.

===Austro-Tai===
An Austro-Tai proposal linking Austronesian and the Kra-Dai languages of the southeastern continental Asian mainland was first proposed by Paul K. Benedict, and is supported by Weera Ostapirat, Roger Blench, and Laurent Sagart, based on the traditional comparative method. proposes a series of regular correspondences linking the two families and assumes a primary split, with Kra-Dai speakers being the people who stayed behind in their Chinese homeland. suggests that, if the connection is valid, the relationship is unlikely to be one of two sister families. Rather, he suggests that proto-Kra-Dai speakers were Austronesians who migrated to Hainan Island and back to the mainland from the northern Philippines, and that their distinctiveness results from radical restructuring following contact with Hmong–Mien and Sinitic. An extended version of Austro-Tai was hypothesized by Benedict who added the Japonic languages to the proposal as well.

===Austric===
A link with the Austroasiatic languages in an &#x27;Austric&#x27; phylum is based mostly on typological evidence. However, there is also morphological evidence of a connection between the conservative Nicobarese languages and Austronesian languages of the Philippines. Robert Blust supports the hypothesis which connects the lower Yangtze neolithic Austro-Tai entity with the rice-cultivating Austro-Asiatic cultures, assuming the center of East Asian rice domestication, and putative Austric homeland, to be located in the Yunnan/Burma border area. Under that view, there was an east-west genetic alignment, resulting from a rice-based population expansion, in the southern part of East Asia: Austroasiatic-Kra-Dai-Austronesian, with unrelated Sino-Tibetan occupying a more northerly tier.

===Sino-Austronesian===

French linguist and Sinologist Laurent Sagart considers the Austronesian languages to be related to the Sino-Tibetan languages, and also groups the Kra–Dai languages as more closely related to the Malayo-Polynesian languages. Sagart argues for a north-south genetic relationship between Chinese and Austronesian, based on sound correspondences in the basic vocabulary and morphological parallels. Laurent Sagart (2017) concludes that the possession of the two kinds of millets in Taiwanese Austronesian languages (not just Setaria, as previously thought) places the pre-Austronesians in northeastern China, adjacent to the probable Sino-Tibetan homeland. Ko et al.&#x27;s genetic research (2014) appears to support Laurent Sagart&#x27;s linguistic proposal, pointing out that the exclusively Austronesian mtDNA E-haplogroup and the largely Sino-Tibetan M9a haplogroup are twin sisters, indicative of an intimate connection between the early Austronesian and Sino-Tibetan maternal gene pools, at least. Additionally, results from Wei et al. (2017) are also in agreement with Sagart&#x27;s proposal, in which their analyses show that the predominantly Austronesian Y-DNA haplogroup O3a2b*-P164(xM134) belongs to a newly defined haplogroup O3a2b2-N6 being widely distributed along the eastern coastal regions of Asia, from Korea to Vietnam. Sagart also groups the Austronesian languages in a recursive-like fashion, placing Kra-Dai as a sister branch of Malayo-Polynesian. His methodology has been found to be spurious by his peers.

===Japanese===

Several linguists have proposed that Japanese is genetically related to the Austronesian family, cf. Benedict (1990), Matsumoto (1975), Miller (1967).

Some other linguists think it is more plausible that Japanese is not genetically related to the Austronesian languages, but instead was influenced by an Austronesian substratum or adstratum.

Those who propose this scenario suggest that the Austronesian family once covered the islands to the north as well as to the south. Martine Robbeets (2017) claims that Japanese genetically belongs to the &quot;Transeurasian&quot; (= Macro-Altaic) languages, but underwent lexical influence from &quot;para-Austronesian&quot;, a presumed sister language of Proto-Austronesian.

The linguist Ann Kumar (2009) proposed that some Austronesians might have migrated to Japan, possibly an elite-group from Java, and created the Japanese-hierarchical society. She also identifies 82 possible cognates between Austronesian and Japanese, however her theory remains very controversial. The linguist Asha Pereltsvaig criticized Kumar&#x27;s theory on several points. The archaeological problem with that theory is that, contrary to the claim that there was no rice farming in China and Korea in prehistoric times, excavations have indicated that rice farming has been practiced in this area since at least 5000 BC. There are also genetic problems. The pre-Yayoi Japanese lineage was not shared with Southeast Asians, but was shared with Northwest Chinese, Tibetans and Central Asians. Linguistic problems were also pointed out. Kumar did not claim that Japanese was an Austronesian language derived from proto-Javanese language, but only that it provided a superstratum language for old Japanese, based on 82 plausible Javanese-Japanese cognates, mostly related to rice farming.

===East Asian===

In 2001, Stanley Starosta proposed a new language family named East Asian, that includes all primary language families in the broader East Asia region except Japonic and Koreanic. This proposed family consists of two branches, Austronesian and Sino-Tibetan-Yangzian, with the Kra-Dai family considered to be a branch of Austronesian, and &quot;Yangzian&quot; to be a new sister branch of Sino-Tibetan consisting of the Austroasiatic and Hmong-Mien languages. This proposal was further researched by linguists like Michael D. Larish in 2006, who also included the Japonic and Koreanic languages in the macrofamily. The proposal has since been adopted by linguists such as George van Driem, albeit without the inclusion of Japonic and Koreanic.

===Ongan===

 proposed that the Austronesian and the Ongan protolanguage are the descendants of an Austronesian–Ongan protolanguage. This view is not supported by mainstream linguists and remains very controversial. Robert Blust rejects Blevins&#x27; proposal as far-fetched and based solely on chance resemblances and methodologically flawed comparisons.

<doc id="58805" wikidata="Q143158" url="?curid=58805" title="Malayo-Polynesian languages">
<text>The Malayo-Polynesian languages are a subgroup of the Austronesian languages, with approximately 385.5 million speakers. The Malayo-Polynesian languages are spoken by the Austronesian peoples outside of Taiwan, in the island nations of Southeast Asia (Indonesia and the Philippine Archipelago) and the Pacific Ocean, with a smaller number in continental Asia in the areas near the Malay Peninsula, with Cambodia, Vietnam and the Chinese island Hainan as the northwest geographic outlier. Malagasy, spoken on the island of Madagascar off the eastern coast of Africa in the Indian Ocean, is the furthest western outlier.

Many languages of the Malayo-Polynesian family in insular Southeast Asia show the strong influence of Sanskrit, Tamil and Arabic, as the western part of the region has been a stronghold of Hinduism, Buddhism, and, later, Islam.

Two morphological characteristics of the Malayo-Polynesian languages are a system of affixation and reduplication (repetition of all or part of a word, such as &quot;wiki-wiki)&quot; to form new words. Like other Austronesian languages, they have small phonemic inventories; thus a text has few but frequent sounds. The majority also lack consonant clusters. Most also have only a small set of vowels, five being a common number.

==Major languages==

All major and official Austronesian languages belong to the Malayo-Polynesian subgroup. Malayo-Polynesian languages with more than five million speakers are: Indonesian, Javanese, Sundanese, Tagalog, Malagasy, Malay, Cebuano, Madurese, Ilocano, Hiligaynon, and Minangkabau.
Among the remaining more than 1,000 languages, several have national/official language status, e.g. Tongan, Samoan, Māori, Gilbertese, Fijian, Hawaiian, Palauan, and Chamorro.

== Typological characteristics ==
==Terminology==
The term &quot;Malayo-Polynesian&quot; was originally coined in 1841 by Franz Bopp as the name for the Austronesian language family as a whole, and until the mid-20th century (after the introduction of the term &quot;Austronesian&quot; by Wilhelm Schmidt in 1906), &quot;Malayo-Polynesian&quot; and &quot;Austronesian&quot; were used as synonyms. The current use of &quot;Malayo-Polynesian&quot; denoting the subgroup comprising all Austronesian languages outside of Taiwan was introduced in the 1970s, and has eventually become standard terminology in Austronesian studies.

==Classification==
===Relation to Austronesian languages on Taiwan===
In spite of a few features shared with the Eastern Formosan languages (such as the merger of proto-Austronesian *t, *C to /t/), there is no conclusive evidence that would link the Malayo-Polynesian languages to any one of the primary branches of Austronesian on Taiwan.

===Internal classification===
Malayo-Polynesian consists of a large number of small local language clusters, with the one exception being Oceanic, the only large group which is universally accepted; its parent language Proto-Oceanic has been reconstructed in all aspects of its structure (phonology, lexicon, morphology and syntax). All other large groups within Malayo-Polynesian are controversial.

The most influential proposal for the internal subgrouping of the Malayo-Polynesian languages was made by Robert Blust who presented several papers advocating a division into two major branches, viz. Western Malayo-Polynesian and Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian.

Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian is widely accepted as a subgroup, although some objections have been raised against its validity as a genetic subgroup. On the other hand, Western Malayo-Polynesian is now generally held (including by Blust himself) to be an umbrella term without genetic relevance. Taking into account the Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian hypothesis, the Malayo-Polynesian languages can be divided into the following subgroups (proposals for larger subgroups are given below):
*Malayo-Polynesian
**Philippine (disputed)
***Batanic languages
***Northern Luzon
***Central Luzon
***Northern Mindoro
***Greater Central Philippine
***Kalamian
***South Mindanao (also called Bilic languages)
***Sangiric
***Minahasan
***Umiray Dumaget
***Manide–Alabat
***Ati
***Klata
**Sama–Bajaw
**North Bornean
***Northeast Sabahan
***Southwest Sabahan
***North Sarawak
**Kayan–Murik
**Land Dayak
**Barito (including Malagasy)
**Moken–Moklen
**Malayo-Chamic
***Chamic
***Malayic
**Northwest Sumatra–Barrier Islands (probably including the Enggano language)
**Rejang
**Lampung-Komering
**Sundanese
**Javanese
**Madurese
**Bali-Sasak-Sumbawa
**Celebic
**South Sulawesi
**Palauan
**Chamorro
**Central–Eastern Malayo-Polynesian
***Central Malayo-Polynesian (dubious)
****Sumba–Flores
****Flores–Lembata
****Selaru
****Kei–Tanimbar
****Aru
****Central Maluku
****Timoric (also called Timor–Babar languages)
****Kowiai
****Teor-Kur
***Eastern Malayo-Polynesian (dubious)
****South Halmahera–West New Guinea
****Oceanic (approximately 450 languages)
====Nasal====
The position of the recently rediscovered Nasal language (spoken on Sumatra) is unclear; it shares features of lexicon and phonology with both Lampung and Rejang.

====Enggano====
Edwards (2015) argues that Enggano is a primary branch of Malayo-Polynesian. However, this is disputed by Smith (2017), who considers Enggano to have undergone significant internal changes, but to have once been much more like other Sumatran languages in Sumatra.

====Philippine languages====

The status of the Philippine languages as subgroup of Malayo-Polynesian is disputed. While many scholars (such as Robert Blust) support a genealogical subgroup that includes the languages of the Philippines and northern Sulawesi, Reid (2018) rejects the hypothesis of a single Philippine subgroup, but instead argues that the Philippine branches represent first-order subgroups directly descended from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian.

==== (Zobel 2002)==== 
Zobel (2002) proposes a &quot;Nuclear Malayo-Polynesian&quot; subgroup, based on putative shared innovations in the Austronesian alignment and syntax found throughout Indonesia apart from much of Borneo and the north of Sulawesi. This subgroup comprises the languages of the Greater Sunda Islands (Malayo-Chamic, Northwest Sumatra–Barrier Islands, Lampung, Sundanese, Javanese, Madurese, Bali-Sasak-Sumbawa) and most of Sulawesi (Celebic, South Sulawesi), Palauan, Chamorro and the Central–Eastern Malayo-Polynesian languages. This hypothesis is one of the few attempts to link certain Western Malayo-Polynesian languages with the Central-Eastern Malayo-Polynesian languages in a higher intermediate subgroup, but has received little further scholarly attention.

====Malayo-Sumbawan (Adelaar 2005)====

The Malayo-Sumbawan languages are a proposal by K. Alexander Adelaar (2005) which unites the Malayo-Chamic languages, the Bali-Sasak-Sumbawa languages, Madurese and Sundanese into a single subgroup based on phonological as well as lexical evidence.
*Malayo-Sumbawan
**Malayo-Chamic-BSS
***Malayic
***Chamic
***Bali-Sasak-Sumbawa
**Sundanese
**Madurese
====Greater North Borneo (Blust 2010; Smith 2017, 2017a)====

The Greater North Borneo hypothesis, which unites all languages spoken on Borneo except for the Barito languages together with the Malayo-Chamic languages, Rejang and Sundanese into a single subgroup, was first proposed by Blust (2010) and further elaborated by Smith (2017, 2017a).
*Greater North Borneo
**North Borneo
***Northeast Sabah
***Southwest Sabah
***North Sarawak
**Kayan–Murik
**Land Dayak
**Malayo-Chamic
**Moken (not included by Smith (2017))
**Rejang
**Sundanese
Because of the inclusion of Malayo-Chamic and Sundanese, the Greater North Borneo hypothesis is incompatible with Adelaar&#x27;s Malayo-Sumbawan proposal. Consequently, Blust explicitly rejects Malayo-Sumbawan as a subgroup. The Greater North Borneo subgroup is based solely on lexical evidence.

====Smith (2017)==== 
Based on a proposal initially brought forward by Blust (2010) as an extension of the Greater North Borneo hypothesis, Smith (2017) unites several Malayo-Polynesian subgroups in a &quot;Western Indonesian&quot; group, thus greatly reducing the number of primary branches of Malayo-Polynesian:
*Malayo-Polynesian
**Western Indonesian
***Greater North Borneo
****North Borneo
*****Northeast Sabah
*****Southwest Sabah
*****North Sarawak
****Central Sarawak
****Kayanic
****Land Dayak
****Malayic
****Chamic
****Sundanese
****Rejang
***Greater Barito (linkage)
****Sama–Bajaw
****Greater Barito (paraphyletic linkage)
***Lampung
***Javanese
***Madurese
***Bali-Sasak-Sumbawa
**Sumatran (an extended version of Northwest Sumatra–Barrier Islands that also comprises Nasal; the question of internal subgrouping is left open by Smith)
**Celebic
**South Sulawesi
**Palauan
**Chamorro
**Moklenic
**Central–Eastern Malayo-Polynesian
**Philippine (linkage) (according to Smith, &quot;not a subgroup as much as a loosely related group of languages that may contain multiple primary branches&quot;)

<text>New York divorce law changed on August 15, 2010, when Governor David Paterson signed no-fault divorce into law in New York state. Until 2010, New York recognized divorces only upon fault-based criteria or upon separation. The State Senate approved the No-Fault Divorce bill on June 30, and the State Assembly passed the bill on July 1.

==Overview==
Despite being generally considered a liberal state, New York has a history of being conservative on issues regarding marriage; it was the last state in the country to allow no-fault divorce and still maintains a (seldom enforced) law against adultery (Penal Law § 255.17). Until 1966, adultery was the only ground of divorce; cruelty, a ground that had long been available in most other states, was not available in New York.

==Divorce grounds==
New York is a mixed state that allows for both no-fault and at-fault divorce. In the US, about one-third of states, most of them in the West and Midwest, are only no-fault, having abolished at-fault divorce. A notable non-Western and non-Midwestern state that is only no fault is Florida.

===At fault divorce===
The state of New York is one of the states which allow the possibility of an &quot;at fault divorce&quot;. In this case, one party accuses the other of a wrongdoing (the &quot;fault&quot;). The other party may or may not contest. In the past, the parties might use the at fault grounds to obtain a mutually desired and agreed upon divorce: they can agree to an uncontested divorce as long as one of the parties is willing to allege one of the fault-based grounds and the other party accepts the &quot;fault&quot; without contesting it. The continued availability of fault grounds gives a spouse leverage in extracting a favorable settlement, as he or she can threaten to sue on a fault ground, which may have adverse social or business effects on the other spouse, unless he or she is given what he or she wants in the settlement.

An at fault divorce can be obtained due to the following:

* Cruel and inhuman treatment (Domestic Relations Law §170.1)
* Abandonment for a continuous period of one year or more (DRL §170.2)
* Imprisonment for more than three years subsequent to the marriage (DRL §170.3)
* Adultery (DRL §170.4)

&quot;Cruel and inhuman treatment&quot; must be behavior by the defendant that rises to the level such that it makes it improper for the plaintiff to continue to reside with the defendant as husband and wife. Allegations under this ground include allegations of domestic violence and repeated, extreme mental cruelty.

&quot;Abandonment&quot; may be actual or constructive. Actual abandonment is usually one spouse leaving the marital residence without the consent of the other spouse without intention to return. One spouse may also lock out the other spouse from the marital residence. Constructive abandonment is the refusal of &quot;basic obligation arising from the marital contract,&quot; including a cessation of sexual relations; establishing such a prior constructive abandonment may render the spouse who leaves, or locks out the other, as the innocent spouse.

&quot;Adultery&quot; is difficult to prove as it requires corroborating evidence from a third party; thus a statement by the defendant that he or she had sexual relations with a third party is not legally admissible to permit the court to grant a divorce to the plaintiff. Furthermore, if the adultery was &quot;condoned&quot;, i.e. the cheated-on party knew about the extra-marital sexual relationship but continued to stay in a marital, conjugal relationship with their spouse, the adultery cannot serve as a cause for divorce.

===Irretrievable breakdown (no fault)===
Since 2010, a new ground has been added, effectively permitting no-fault divorce in New York state:
* The relationship between husband and wife has broken down irretrievably for a period of at least six months (DRL §170.7)

The parties may also disagree over child support, custody, alimony, division of joint assets or who is going to pay legal fees. These are known as &quot;ancillary relief&quot; (see below) that are requested by one or both of the parties. No judgment of divorce may be granted under the no fault ground unless and until the economic issues of equitable distribution of marital property, the payment or waiver of spousal support, the payment of child support, the payment of counsel and experts’ fees and expenses as well as the custody and visitation with the minor children of the marriage have been resolved by the parties, or determined by the court, and incorporated into the judgment of divorce.

===Separation as ground of divorce===
Separation may also be a ground of divorce.
*Judgment of Separation: &quot;Decree of Separation&quot; or &quot;Judgment of Separation&quot;, given by the court, for at least one year
* Separation Agreement: Spouses have not lived together for at least one year, and have signed an &quot;Agreement of Separation&quot;.

==Procedure==

===Contested divorce===
The grounds for divorce may be decided by a jury or by a judge, all other ancillary relief is considered equitable in nature and must be decided by the judge alone.

The grounds in all cases must be specifically stated in the complaint, giving factual details, dates, and actual places of occurrence. Lack of proper content is not an affirmative defense; the plaintiff must prove the allegations even if uncontroverted; proof is made according to the general rules of evidence. Failure to state a cause of action will result in a judgment dismissing the complaint. Divorce may commence by means of filing and service of a Summons with Notice on the defendant. The defendant must then make an appearance and demand for the complaint by the plaintiff, or is at risk of having the plaintiff granted the divorce by default. Forms for filing or responding to a divorce are available on the state courts website.

Once the case is filed and served the parties must request a Preliminary Conference within ninety days if the case is to be treated as a contested divorce. Such Preliminary Conference will be scheduled if one of the parties files a &quot;Request for Judicial Intervention&quot; (RJI) with required fee. At the Preliminary Conference the court may deal with interim issues, (i.e. temporary custody, child support, attorney fees or spousal support) and will schedule discovery between the parties that includes the valuation of assets and pensions to be divided between the parties.

===Uncontested divorce===

If all the issues are decided between the parties they may agree to submit the papers to the court for approval; this is known as an uncontested divorce. When the defendant is served but does not answer the legal pleadings, the plaintiff may seek a default judgment by application to the court. If the divorce is started with a &quot;Summons with Notice&quot; then the grounds will either have to be proven by plaintiff&#x27;s affidavit, or by testimony at an inquest if the divorce is uncontested or to be granted by default. Uncontested divorces are also granted after the defendant appears and waives the right to answer the complaint. In these cases the defendant neither admits nor denies the plaintiff&#x27;s allegations, it is up to the plaintiff to prove the allegations by testimony or affidavit in such a case.

==Residency requirements==

For New York State Supreme Court to have jurisdiction over the parties (see DRL § 230) one of the following residency conditions must be satisfied:

# The marriage ceremony was performed in New York and either spouse is a resident of the state at the time of the commencement of the action for divorce and resided in the state for a continuous period of one year immediately before the action began.
# The couple lived as husband and wife in New York and either spouse is a resident of the state at the time of the commencement of the action for divorce and resided in this state for a continuous period of one year immediately before the action began.
# The grounds for divorce occurred in New York and either spouse is a resident of the state at the time of the commencement of the action for divorce and resided in the state for a continuous period of one year immediately before the action began.
# The grounds for divorce occurred in New York and both spouses are New York residents at the time the action is commenced.
# If the parties were married outside of New York and have never lived together as husband and wife in the state and the grounds for divorce did not occur in New York then, one spouse must presently be a resident of New York and have resided continuously in the state for at least two years prior to filing an action for divorce.

Residing &quot;continuously&quot; in the state does not mean that the party can not have left the state during the period of residency nor does it mean that the party does not have another residence elsewhere outside New York.

==Ancillary issues==

===Children===
There are three keys issues when children are involved in a divorce or separation:

# Child custody - physical custody (where is the child&#x27;s main residence) and legal custody (who makes decisions about the child) are the two elements of custody. Custody may be joint (shared by consent between the parties) or it may be sole as determined by agreement or by court order. Before custody is awarded the court usually undertakes various investigative steps to determine what is in the best interests of the child or children. If custody is not decided upon by consent (with the court and a court-appointed law guardian representing the child) then a hearing takes place at which both parties present evidence to determine who should have custody in the best interests of the child (or children). The forms for filing for custody and visitation can be found online.
# Child visitation - the parent who does not have physical custody has either: a) reasonable rights of visitation, b) a specified visitation schedule, or c) is limited to supervised visitation. Only in very rare cases may the non-custodial parent be denied visitation. Usually, this is for very specific reasons such as severe substance abuse, history of domestic violence or lack of interest in the child.
# Child support - In New York the amount of child support paid by the non-custodial parent to the custodial parent is determined by the state &quot;Child Support Standards Act.&quot; Based on an adjusted gross income formula the payments are 17% for one child and 25% for two children. There are limits that can be reached for individuals with very low income below the poverty level or very high income (statutorily above $80,000 but usually over $150,000) that will allow for deviations from these percentages. Over and above monthly or weekly child support, the court is also able to award a child support &quot;add-on&quot; for daycare costs if the custodial parent works, educational costs for the child (usually limited to college, not private or religious elementary or high school), and medical expenses, including the cost of medical insurance.

===Property===
Equitable distribution is the law in New York that determines the division of property at the end of a marriage. The court examines thirteen factors in determining the fair division of the property that was accumulated during the marriage and the debts of the parties. The courts have routinely held that equal distribution is the norm except in cases of egregious misconduct, or when dealing with businesses, professional licenses, and college &amp; advanced degrees.

===Spousal support===
Today alimony is known as &quot;maintenance&quot; or &quot;spousal support.&quot; Unlike child support, there is a set formula to calculate spousal support &quot;pendente lite&quot; (&quot;pending the litigation&quot;), but there is no post judgment formula. A grant of spousal support depends on the facts of the case, such as the disparity between the income of the parties, the duration of the marriage, the health of the parties, and the presence of very young children. In New York, spousal support is rarely granted on a permanent basis, except in cases of physical or mental disability or when the parties are elderly (about 60 years old or older). Generally, it is granted for a set period of time so the other party can get back on their feet after the termination of the marriage. The length of time depends on the facts of the case as the judge sees fit to award.

===Legal fees===
When one party to a divorce is unable to afford an attorney that party is allowed to request the court to order the spouse with the greater income or assets to pay all or part of the other spouse&#x27;s legal fees. These awards can be on a temporary basis at the beginning of the suit or at the end, as the judge sees fit in each case.

===Name change===
According to NY Civil Rights Law Section 65, people have the right to choose, and to change, their name without government approval or involvement; thus, people who chose to change their names in connection with marriage do so according to custom, not law. Legally, one can change one&#x27;s name at any time simply by using this newly chosen name consistently and without an intent to commit fraud. However, to give people easy &quot;legal proof&quot; of a name change made in connection with divorce, every divorce decree mentions the name change option and itself represents legal proof or documentation of any concomitant name change. (A parallel provision in the Domestic Relations Law (Section 15) also renders every marriage certificate legal &quot;proof&quot; of a name change upon marriage (if there is one).)

<text>Adultery is extramarital sex that is considered objectionable on social, religious, moral, or legal grounds. Although the sexual activities that constitute adultery vary, as well as the social, religious, and legal consequences, the concept exists in many cultures and shares some similarities in Judaism, Christianity and Islam. Adultery is viewed by many jurisdictions as offensive to public morals, undermining the marriage relationship.

Historically, many cultures considered adultery a very serious crime, some subject to severe punishment, usually for the woman and sometimes for the man, with penalties including capital punishment, mutilation, or torture. Such punishments have gradually fallen into disfavor, especially in Western countries from the 19th century. In countries where adultery is still a criminal offense, punishments range from fines to caning and even capital punishment. Since the 20th century, criminal laws against adultery have become controversial, with most Western countries decriminalising adultery.

However, even in jurisdictions that have decriminalised adultery, it may still have legal consequences, particularly in jurisdictions with fault-based divorce laws, where adultery almost always constitutes a ground for divorce and may be a factor in property settlement, the custody of children, the denial of alimony, etc. Adultery is not a ground for divorce in jurisdictions which have adopted a no-fault divorce model.

International organizations have called for the decriminalisation of adultery, especially in the light of several high-profile stoning cases that have occurred in some countries. The head of the United Nations expert body charged with identifying ways to eliminate laws that discriminate against women or are discriminatory to them in terms of implementation or impact, Kamala Chandrakirana, has stated that: &quot;Adultery must not be classified as a criminal offence at all&quot;. A joint statement by the United Nations Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice states that: &quot;Adultery as a criminal offence violates women’s human rights&quot;.

In Muslim countries that follow Sharia law for criminal justice, the punishment for adultery may be stoning. There are fifteen countries in which stoning is authorized as lawful punishment, though in recent times it has been legally carried out only in Iran and Somalia. Most countries that criminalize adultery are those where the dominant religion is Islam, and several Sub-Saharan African Christian-majority countries, but there are some notable exceptions to this rule, namely the Philippines, and several U.S. states. In some jurisdictions, having sexual relations with the king&#x27;s wife or the wife of his eldest son constitutes treason.

==Overview==

The term &quot;adultery&quot; refers to sexual acts between a married person and someone who is not that person&#x27;s spouse. It may arise in a number of contexts. In criminal law, adultery was a criminal offence in many countries in the past, and is still a crime in some countries today. In family law, adultery may be a ground for divorce, with the legal definition of adultery being &quot;physical contact with an alien and unlawful organ&quot;, while in some countries today, adultery is not in itself grounds for divorce. Extramarital sexual acts not fitting this definition are not &quot;adultery&quot; though they may constitute &quot;unreasonable behavior&quot;, also a ground of divorce.

Another issue is the issue of paternity of a child. The application of the term to the act appears to arise from the idea that &quot;criminal intercourse with a married woman ... tended to adulterate the issue [children] of an innocent husband ... and to expose him to support and provide for another man&#x27;s [children]&quot;. Thus, the &quot;purity&quot; of the children of a marriage is corrupted, and the inheritance is altered.

In archaic law, there was a common law tort of criminal conversation arising from adultery, &quot;conversation&quot; being an archaic euphemism for sexual intercourse. It was a tort action brought by a husband against a third party (“the other man”) who interfered with the marriage relationship.

Some adultery laws differentiate based on the sex of the participants, and as a result such laws are often seen as discriminatory, and in some jurisdictions they have been struck down by courts, usually on the basis that they discriminated against women.

The term &quot;adultery&quot;, rather than &quot;extramarital sex&quot;, implies a moral condemnation of the act; as such it is usually not a neutral term because it carries an implied judgment that the act is wrong.

Adultery refers to sexual relations which are not officially legitimized; for example it does not refer to having sexual intercourse with multiple partners in the case of polygamy (when a man is married to more than one wife at a time, called polygyny; or when a woman is married to more than one husband at a time, called polyandry).

==Definitions and legal constructs==

In the traditional English common law, adultery was a felony. Although the legal definition of &quot;adultery&quot; differs in nearly every legal system, the common theme is sexual relations outside of marriage, in one form or another.

Traditionally, many cultures, particularly Latin American ones, had strong double standards regarding male and female adultery, with the latter being seen as a much more serious violation.

Adultery involving a married woman and a man other than her husband was considered a very serious crime. In 1707, English Lord Chief Justice John Holt stated that a man having sexual relations with another man&#x27;s wife was &quot;the highest invasion of property&quot; and claimed, in regard to the aggrieved husband, that &quot;a man cannot receive a higher provocation&quot; (in a case of murder or manslaughter).

The &quot;Encyclopedia of Diderot &amp; d&#x27;Alembert&quot;, Vol. 1 (1751), also equated adultery to theft writing that, &quot;adultery is, after homicide, the most punishable of all crimes, because it is the most cruel of all thefts, and an outrage capable of inciting murders and the most deplorable excesses.&quot;

Legal definitions of adultery vary. For example, New York defines an adulterer as a person who &quot;engages in sexual intercourse with another person at a time when he has a living spouse, or the other person has a living spouse.&quot; North Carolina defines adultery as occurring when any man and woman &quot;lewdly and lasciviously associate, bed, and cohabit together.&quot;
Minnesota law (repealed in 2023) provided: &quot;when a married woman has sexual intercourse with a man other than her husband, whether married or not, both are guilty of adultery.&quot; In the 2003 New Hampshire Supreme Court case &quot;Blanchflower v. Blanchflower&quot;, it was held that female same-sex sexual relations did not constitute sexual intercourse, based on a 1961 definition from &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third New International Dictionary&quot;; and thereby an accused wife in a divorce case was found not guilty of adultery. In 2001, Virginia prosecuted an attorney, John R. Bushey, for adultery, a case that ended in a guilty plea and a $125 fine. Adultery is against the governing law of the U.S. military.

In common-law countries, adultery was also known as &quot;criminal conversation.&quot; This became the name of the civil tort arising from adultery, being based upon compensation for the other spouse&#x27;s injury. Criminal conversation was usually referred to by lawyers as &quot;crim. con.&quot;, and was abolished in England in 1857, and the Republic of Ireland in 1976. Another tort, alienation of affection, arises when one spouse deserts the other for a third person. This act was also known as desertion, which was often a crime as well. A small number of jurisdictions still allow suits for criminal conversation and/or alienation of affection. In the United States, six states still maintain this tort.

A marriage in which both spouses agree ahead of time to accept sexual relations by either partner with others is sometimes referred to as an open marriage or the swinging lifestyle. Polyamory, meaning the practice, desire, or acceptance of intimate relationships that are not exclusive with respect to other sexual or intimate relationships, with knowledge and consent of everyone involved, sometimes involves such marriages. Swinging and open marriages are both a form of non-monogamy, and the spouses would not view the sexual relations as objectionable. However, irrespective of the stated views of the partners, extramarital relations could still be considered a crime in some legal jurisdictions which criminalize adultery.

In Canada, though the written definition in the &quot;Divorce Act&quot; refers to extramarital relations with someone of the opposite sex, a British Columbia judge used the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot; in a 2005 case to grant a woman a divorce from her husband who had cheated on her with another man, which the judge felt was equal reasoning to dissolve the union.

In England and Wales, case law restricts the definition of adultery to penetrative sexual intercourse between a man and a woman, no matter the gender of the spouses in the marriage. Infidelity with a person of the same gender can be grounds for a divorce as unreasonable behavior; this situation was discussed at length during debates on the Marriage (Same-Sex Couples) Bill. However, the practical effect of this ceased with the introduction of no-fault divorce in April 2022, which meant that unreasonable behavior ceased to be grounds for divorce.

In India, adultery was the sexual intercourse of a man with a married woman without the consent of her husband when such sexual intercourse did not amount to rape, and it was a non-cognizable, non-bailable criminal offence; the adultery law was overturned by the Supreme Court of India on 27 September 2018.

==Prevalence==

Durex&#x27;s Global Sex Survey found that worldwide 22% of people surveyed admitted to have had extramarital sex. According to a 2015 study by Durex and Match.com, Thailand and Denmark were the most adulterous countries based on the percentage of adults who admitted having an affair.

In the United States Alfred Kinsey found in his studies that 50% of males and 26% of females had extramarital sex at least once during their lifetime. Depending on studies, it was estimated that 22.7% of men and 11.6% of women, had extramarital sex. Other authors say that between 20% and 25% of Americans had sex with someone other than their spouse.

Three 1990s studies in the United States, using nationally representative samples, have found that about 10–15% of women and 20–25% of men admitted to having engaged in extramarital sex.

The Standard Cross-Cultural Sample described the occurrence of extramarital sex by gender in over 50 pre-industrial cultures. The occurrence of extramarital sex by men is described as &quot;universal&quot; in 6 cultures, &quot;moderate&quot; in 29 cultures, &quot;occasional&quot; in 6 cultures, and &quot;uncommon&quot; in 10 cultures. The occurrence of extramarital sex by women is described as &quot;universal&quot; in 6 cultures, &quot;moderate&quot; in 23 cultures, &quot;occasional&quot; in 9 cultures, and &quot;uncommon&quot; in 15 cultures.

==Cultural and religious traditions==

===Greco-Roman world===
In the Greco-Roman world, there were stringent laws against adultery, but these applied to sexual intercourse with a married woman. In the early Roman Law, the &quot;jus tori&quot; belonged to the husband. It was therefore not illegal for a husband to have sex with a slave or an unmarried woman.

The Roman husband often took advantage of his legal immunity. Thus historian Spartianus said that Verus, the imperial colleague of Marcus Aurelius, did not hesitate to declare to his reproaching wife: &quot;Uxor enim dignitatis nomen est, non voluptatis.&quot; (&quot;&#x27;Wife&#x27; connotes rank, not sexual pleasure&quot;, or more literally &quot;Wife is the name of dignity, not bliss&quot;) (Verus, V).

Later in Roman history, as William E.H. Lecky has shown, the idea that the husband owed a fidelity similar to that demanded of the wife must have gained ground, at least in theory. Lecky gathers from the legal maxim of Ulpian: &quot;It seems most unfair for a man to require from a wife the chastity he does not himself practice&quot;.

According to Plutarch, the lending of wives practiced among some people was also encouraged by Lycurgus, though from a motive other than that which actuated the practice (Plutarch, Lycurgus, XXIX). The recognized license of the Greek husband may be seen in the following passage of the pseudo-Demosthenic &quot;Oration Against Neaera&quot;:

:&quot;We keep mistresses for our pleasures, concubines for constant attendance, and wives to bear us legitimate children and to be our faithful housekeepers. Yet, because of the wrong done to the husband only, the Athenian lawgiver Solon allowed any man to kill an adulterer whom he had taken in the act.&quot; (Plutarch, Solon)

The Roman Lex Julia, &quot;Lex Iulia de Adulteriis Coercendis&quot; (17 BC), punished adultery with banishment. The two guilty parties were sent to different islands (&quot;dummodo in &quot;diversas&quot; insulas relegentur&quot;), and part of their property was confiscated. Fathers were permitted to kill daughters and their partners in adultery. Husbands could kill the partners under certain circumstances and were required to divorce adulterous wives.

===Abrahamic religions===
====Biblical sources====

Both Judaism and Christianity base their injunction against adultery on passages in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament in Christianity), which firstly prohibits adultery in the Seventh Commandment: &quot;Thou shalt not commit adultery.&quot;
(). However, Judaism and Christianity differ on what actually constitutes adultery.

 defines what constitutes adultery in the Hebrew Bible, and it also prescribes the punishment as capital punishment. In this verse, and in the Jewish tradition, adultery consists of sexual intercourse between a man and a &quot;married&quot; woman who is not his lawful wife:

And the man that committeth adultery with another man&#x27;s wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour&#x27;s wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.

Thus, according to the Hebrew Bible, adultery is not committed if the female participant is unmarried (unless she is betrothed to be married), while the marital status of the male participant is irrelevant (he himself could be married or unmarried to another woman).

If a married woman was raped by a man who is not her husband, only the rapist is punished for adultery. The victim is not punished: as the Bible declares, &quot;this matter is similar to when a man rises up against his fellow and murders him&quot;; just as a murder victim is not guilty of murder, a rape victim is not guilty of adultery.

Michael Coogan writes that according to the text wives are the property of their husband, marriage meaning transfer of property (from father to husband), and adultery is violating the property right of the husband. However, in contrast to other ancient Near Eastern law collections which treat adultery as an offense against the husband alone, and allow the husband to waive or mitigate the punishment, Biblical law allows no such mitigation, on the grounds that God as well as the husband is offended by adultery, and an offense against God cannot be forgiven by man. In addition, Coogan&#x27;s book was criticized by Phyllis Trible, who argues that that patriarchy was not decreed, but only described by God. She claims that Paul the Apostle made the same mistake as Coogan.

David&#x27;s sexual intercourse with Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah, is described by the Bible as a &quot;sin&quot; whose punishment included the ravishment of David&#x27;s own wives. According to Jennifer Wright Knust, David&#x27;s act was adultery only according to the spirit and not the letter of the law, because Uriah was non-Jewish, and (according to Knust) the Biblical codes only technically applied to Israelites. However, according to Jacob Milgrom, Jews and resident foreigners received equal protection under Biblical law. In any case, according to the Babylonian Talmud, Uriah was indeed Jewish and wrote a provisional bill of divorce prior to going out to war, specifying that if he fell in battle, the divorce would take effect from the time the writ was issued.

====Judaism====
Though Leviticus 20:10 prescribes the death penalty for adultery, the legal procedural requirements were very exacting and required the testimony of two eyewitnesses of good character for conviction. The defendant also must have been warned immediately before performing the act. A death sentence could be issued only during the period when the Holy Temple stood, and only so long as the Sanhedrin court convened in its chamber within the Temple complex. Technically, therefore, no death penalty can now be applied.

The death penalty for adultery was generally strangulation, except in the case of a woman who was the daughter of a Kohen, which was specifically mentioned in Scripture as the penalty of burning (pouring molten lead down the throat), or a woman who was betrothed but not married, in which case the punishment for both man and woman was stoning.

At the civil level, Jewish law (halakha) forbids a man to continue living with an adulterous wife, and he is obliged to divorce her. Also, an adulteress is not permitted to marry the adulterer, but (to avoid any doubt as to her status as being free to marry another or that of her children) many authorities say he must give her a divorce as if they were married.

According to Judaism, the Seven laws of Noah apply to all of humankind; these laws prohibit adultery to non-Jews as well as Jews.

The extramarital intercourse of a married man is not in itself considered a crime in biblical or later Jewish law; it was considered akin to polygyny, which was permitted. Similarly, sexual intercourse between an unmarried man and a woman who was neither married nor betrothed was not considered adultery. This concept of adultery stems from the economic aspect of Israelite marriage whereby the husband has an exclusive right to his wife, whereas the wife, as the husband&#x27;s possession, did not have an exclusive right to her husband.

====Christianity====
Adultery is considered immoral by Christians and a sin, based primarily on passages like and . Although does say that &quot;and that is what some of you were. But you were washed&quot;, it still acknowledges adultery to be immoral and a sin.

Catholicism ties fornication with breaking the sixth commandment in its Catechism.

Until a few decades ago, adultery was a criminal offense in many countries where the dominant religion is Christianity, especially in Roman Catholic countries (for example, in Austria it was a criminal offense until 1997). Adultery was decriminalized in Chile in 1994, Argentina in 1995, Brazil in 2005 and Mexico in 2011, but in some predominantly Catholic countries, such as the Philippines, it remains illegal.

The Book of Mormon also prohibits adultery. For instance, Abinadi cites the Ten Commandments when he accuses King Noah&#x27;s priests of sexual immorality. When Jesus Christ visits the Americas he reinforces the law and teaches them the higher law (also found in the New Testament):

:&quot;Behold, it is written by them of old time, that thou shalt not commit adultery; but I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman, to lust after her, hath committed adultery already in his heart.&quot;

Some churches such as the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have interpreted &quot;adultery&quot; to include all sexual relationships outside of marriage, regardless of the marital status of the participants. Book of Mormon prophets and civil leaders often list adultery as an illegal activity along with murder, robbing, and stealing.

====Islam====

&quot;Zina&#x27;&quot; is an Arabic term for illegal intercourse, premarital or extramarital. Various conditions and punishments have been attributed to adultery. Under Islamic law, adultery in general is sexual intercourse by a person (whether man or woman) with someone to whom they are not married. Adultery is a violation of the marital contract and one of the major sins condemned by God in the Qur&#x27;an:

Qur&#x27;anic verses prohibiting adultery include:

Punishments are reserved to the legal authorities and false accusations are to be punished severely. It has been said that these legal procedural requirements were instituted to protect women from slander and false accusations: i.e. four witnesses of good character are required for conviction, who were present at that time and saw the deed taking place; and if they saw it they were not of good moral character, as they were looking at naked adults; thus no one can be convicted of adultery unless both of the accused also agree and give their confession under oath four times.

According to &quot;a hadith&quot; attributed to Muhammad, an unmarried person who commits adultery or fornication is punished by flogging 100 times; a married person will then be stoned to death. A survey conducted by the Pew Research Center found support for stoning as a punishment for adultery mostly in Arab countries; it was supported in Egypt (82% of respondents in favor of the punishment) and Jordan (70% in favor), as well as Pakistan (82% favor), whereas in Nigeria (56% in favor) and in Indonesia (42% in favor) opinion is more divided, perhaps due to diverging traditions and differing interpretations of Sharia.

===Eastern religions===

====Hinduism====
The Hindu Sanskrit texts present a range of views on adultery, offering widely differing positions. The hymn 4.5.5 of the &quot;Rigveda&quot; calls adultery &quot;pāpa&quot; (evil, sin). Other Vedic texts call adultery a sin, just like murder, incest, anger, evil thoughts and trickery. The Vedic texts, including the &quot;Rigveda&quot;, the &quot;Atharvaveda&quot; and the Upanishads, also acknowledge the existence of male lovers and female lovers as a basic fact of human life, followed by the recommendation that one should avoid such extramarital sex during certain ritual occasions (yajna). The Rigveda describes a woman&#x27;s eagerness to meet her lover, and one hymn asjs the gods to protect the embryo of a pregnant wife as she sleeps with her husband and other lovers.

Adultery and similar offenses are discussed under one of the eighteen &quot;vivādapadas&quot; (titles of laws) in the &quot;dharma&quot; literature of Hinduism. These texts generally condemn adultery, with some exceptions involving consensual sex and &quot;niyoga&quot; (levirate conception) in order to produce an heir. According to &quot;Apastamba Dharmasutra&quot;, the earliest dated Hindu law text, cross-varna adultery is a punishable crime, where the man receives a far more severe punishment than the woman. In &quot;Gautama Dharmasutra&quot;, the adulterous woman is liable to harsh punishment for the cross-class adultery. While &quot;Gautama Dharmasutra&quot; reserves the punishment in cases of cross-class adultery, it seems to have been generalized by &quot;Vishnu Dharmasastra&quot; and &quot;Manusmiriti&quot;. The recommended punishments in the text also vary between these texts.

The &quot;Manusmriti&quot;, also known as the &quot;Laws of Manu&quot;, deals with this in greater detail. Verse 4.134 declares adultery to be a heinous offense. The &quot;Manusmriti&quot; does not include adultery as a &quot;grievous sin&quot;, but includes it as a &quot;secondary sin&quot; that leads to a loss of caste. Intent and consent are a elements that determine the appropriate punishment. Rape is not considered adultery for the woman, while the rapist is punished severely. Lesser punishment is recommended for consensual adulterous sex. Manu recommends the death penalty for a man who rapes a virgin. Other penalties range from fines and head-shaving to the loss of a limb, depenon the relative social status of those involved. In verses 8.362-363, the author states that sexual relations with the wife of traveling performer is not a sin, and reduces the penalty to a small fine.
Verse 5.152 of says that a woman must constantly worship her husband as a god and be completely faithful even if he commits adultery. Although the &quot;Manusmrti&quot; recommends sexual fidelity in marriage, it also accepts that adulterous relationships happen and that children are born from such unions. According to Manu, a child conceived through adultery should belonf to its mother&#x27;s husband and not to its biological father.

Other &quot;dharmasastra&quot; texts describe adultery as a punishable crime but offer differing details. According to &quot;Naradasmriti&quot; , the term adultery in is not confined to the relationship of a married man with another man&#x27;s wife. It includes sex with any woman who is protected by another man, including wives, daughters, other relatives, and servants. Adultery is not a punishable offence for a man if &quot;the woman&#x27;s husband has abandoned her because she is wicked, or he is eunuch, or of a man who does not care, provided the wife initiates it of her own volition&quot;. Adultery is not a punishable offence if a married man engages in intercourse with woman who doesn&#x27;t belong to other man and is not a Brahmin, provided the woman is not of higher caste than the man. Brihaspati-smriti mention, among other things, adulterous local customs in ancient India and then states, &quot;for such practices these (people) incur neither penance nor secular punishment&quot;. Kautilya&#x27;s &quot;Arthashastra&quot; includes an exemption that in case the husband forgives his adulterous wife, the woman and her lover should be set free. If the offended husband does not forgive, the &quot;Arthashastra&quot; recommends the adulterous woman&#x27;s nose and ears be cut off, while her lover be executed.

In &quot;Kamasutra&quot;, which is not a religious text like Vedas or Puranas but an ancient text on love and sex, Vatsyayana discusses adultery and devotes &quot;not less than fifteen sutras (1.5.6–20) to enumerating the reasons (&quot;karana&quot;) for which a man is allowed to seduce a married woman&quot;. According to Wendy Doniger, the &quot;Kamasutra&quot; teaches adulterous sexual liaison as a means for a man to predispose the involved woman in assisting him, working against his enemies and facilitating his successes. It also explains the many signs and reasons a woman wants to enter into an adulterous relationship and when she does not want to commit adultery. The &quot;Kamasutra&quot; teaches strategies to engage in adulterous relationships, but concludes its chapter on sexual liaison stating that one should not commit adultery because adultery pleases only one of two sides in a marriage, hurts the other, it goes against both &quot;dharma&quot; and &quot;artha&quot;.

According to Werner Menski, the Sanskrit texts take &quot;widely different positions on adultery&quot;, with some considering it a minor offense that can be addressed with penance, but others treat it as a severe offense that depending on the caste deserves the death penalty for the man or the woman. According to Ramanathan and Weerakoon, in Hinduism, the sexual matters are left to the judgment of those involved and not a matter to be imposed through law.

According to Carl Olsen, the classical Hindu society considered adultery as a sexual transgression but treated it with a degree of tolerance. It is described as a minor transgression in &quot;Naradasmriti&quot; and other texts, one that a sincere penance could atone. Penance is also recommended to a married person who does not actually commit adultery, but carries adulterous thoughts for someone else or is thinking of committing adultery.

Other Hindu texts present a more complex model of behavior and mythology where gods commit adultery for various reasons. For example, Krishna commits adultery and the &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; justifies it as something to be expected when Vishnu took a human form, just like sages become uncontrolled. According to Tracy Coleman, Radha and other gopis are indeed lovers of Krishna, but this is &quot;prema&quot; or &quot;selfless, true love&quot; and not carnal craving. In Hindu texts, this relationship between gopis and Krishna involves secret nightly rendezvous. Some texts state it to be divine adultery, others as a symbolism of spiritual dedication and religious value. The example of Krishna&#x27;s adulterous behavior has been used by Sahajiyas Hindus of Bengal to justify their own behavior that is contrary to the mainstream Hindu norm, according to Doniger. Other Hindu texts state that Krishna&#x27;s adultery is not a license for other men to do the same, in the same way that men should not drink poison just because Rudra-Shiva drank poison during the Samudra Manthan. A similar teaching is found in Mahayana Buddhism, states Doniger.

The &quot;Linga Purana&quot; indicates that sexual hospitality existed in ancient India. The sage Sudarshana, asks his wife Oghavati to please their guests in this way. One day, he comes home while she is having sex with a mendicant who visits their house. Sudarshana tells them to continue. The mendicant turns out to be Dharma, the lord of righteous conduct, who blesses the couple for their upholding of social law.

====Buddhism====
Buddhist texts such as Digha Nikāya describe adultery as a form of sexual wrongdoing that is one link in a chain of immorality and misery. According to Wendy Doniger, this view of adultery as evil is postulated in early Buddhist texts as having originated from greed in a previous life. This idea combines Hindu and Buddhist thoughts then prevalent. Sentient beings without body, state the canonical texts, are reborn on earth due to their greed and craving, some people become beautiful and some ugly, some become men and some women. The ugly envy the beautiful and this triggers the ugly to commit adultery with the wives of the beautiful. Like in Hindu mythology, states Doniger, Buddhist texts explain adultery as a result from sexual craving; it initiates a degenerative process.

Buddhism considers celibacy as the monastic ideal. For he who feels that he cannot live in celibacy, it recommends that he never commit adultery with another&#x27;s wife. Engaging in sex outside of marriage, with the wife of another man, with a girl who is engaged to be married, or a girl protected by her relatives (father or brother), or extramarital sex with prostitutes, ultimately causes suffering to other human beings and oneself. It should be avoided, state the Buddhist canonical texts.

Buddhist Pali texts narrate legends where the Buddha explains the karmic consequences of adultery. For example, states Robert Goldman, one such story is of Thera Soreyya. Buddha states in the Soreyya story that &quot;men who commit adultery suffer hell for hundreds of thousands of years after rebirth, then are reborn a hundred successive times as women on earth, must earn merit by &quot;utter devotion to their husbands&quot; in these lives, before they can be reborn again as men to pursue a monastic life and liberation from &quot;samsara&quot;.

There are some differences between the Buddhist texts and the Hindu texts on the identification and consequences of adultery. According to José Ignacio Cabezón, for example, the Hindu text &quot;Naradasmriti&quot; considers consensual extra-marital sex between a man and a woman in certain circumstances (such as if the husband has abandoned the woman) as not a punishable crime, but the Buddhist texts &quot;nowhere exculpate&quot; any adulterous relationship. The term adultery in &quot;Naradasmriti&quot; is broader in scope than the one in Buddhist sources. In the text, various acts such as secret meetings, exchange of messages and gifts, &quot;inappropriate touching&quot; and a false accusation of adultery, are deemed adulterous, while Buddhist texts do not recognize these acts under adultery. Later texts such as the &quot;Dhammapada&quot;, &quot;Pancasiksanusamsa Sutra&quot; and a few Mahayana sutras state that &quot;heedless man who runs after other men&#x27;s wife&quot; acquire demerit, blame, discomfort and are reborn in hell. Other Buddhist texts make no mention of legal punishments for adultery.

===Other historical practices===
In some Native American cultures, severe penalties could be imposed on an adulterous wife by her husband. In many instances she was made to endure a bodily mutilation which would, in the mind of the aggrieved husband, prevent her from ever being a temptation to other men again. Among the Aztecs, wives caught in adultery were occasionally impaled, although the more usual punishment was to be stoned to death.

The Code of Hammurabi, a well-preserved Babylonian law code of ancient Mesopotamia, dating back to about 1772 BC, provided drowning as punishment for adultery.

Amputation of the noserhinotomywas a punishment for adultery among many civilizations, including ancient India, ancient Egypt, among Greeks and Romans, and in Byzantium and among the Arabs.

In the tenth century, the Arab explorer Ibn Fadlan noted that adultery was unknown among the pagan Oghuz Turks. Ibn Fadlan writes that &quot;adultery is unknown among them; but whomsoever they find by his conduct that he is an adulterer, they tear him in two. This comes about so: they bring together the branches of two trees, tie him to the branches and then let both trees go, so that he is torn in two.&quot;

In medieval Europe, early Jewish law mandated stoning for an adulterous wife and her partner.

In England and its successor states, it has been high treason to engage in adultery with the King&#x27;s wife, his eldest son&#x27;s wife and his eldest unmarried daughter. The jurist Sir William Blackstone writes that &quot;the plain intention of this law is to guard the Blood Royal from any suspicion of bastardy, whereby the succession to the Crown might be rendered dubious.&quot; Adultery was a serious issue when it came to succession to the crown. Philip IV of France had all three of his daughters-in-law imprisoned, two (Margaret of Burgundy and Blanche of Burgundy) on the grounds of adultery and the third (Joan of Burgundy) for being aware of their adulterous behaviour. The two brothers accused of being lovers of the king&#x27;s daughters-in-law were executed immediately after being arrested. The wife of Philip IV&#x27;s eldest son bore a daughter, the future Joan II of Navarre, whose paternity and succession rights were disputed all her life.

The christianization of Europe came to mean that, in theory, and unlike with the Romans, there was supposed to be a single sexual standard, where adultery was a sin and against the teachings of the church, regardless of the sex of those involved. In practice, however, the church seemed to have accepted the traditional double standard which punished the adultery of the wife more harshly than that of the husband. Among Germanic tribes, each tribe had its own laws for adultery, and many of them allowed the husband to &quot;take the law in his hands&quot; and commit acts of violence against a wife caught committing adultery. In the Middle Ages, adultery in Vienna was punishable by death through impalement. Austria was one of the last Western countries to decriminalize adultery, in 1997.

The &quot;Encyclopedia of Diderot &amp; d&#x27;Alembert&quot;, Vol. 1 (1751) noted the legal double standard from that period, it wrote:
&quot;Furthermore, although the husband who violates conjugal trust is guilty as well as the woman, it is not permitted for her to accuse him, nor to pursue him because of this crime&quot;.
==Adultery and the law==

Historically, many cultures considered adultery a very serious crime, some subject to severe punishment, especially for the married woman and sometimes for her sex partner, with penalties including capital punishment, mutilation, or torture. Such punishments have gradually fallen into disfavor, especially in Western countries from the 19th century. In countries where adultery is still a criminal offense, punishments range from fines to caning and even capital punishment. Since the 20th century, such laws have become controversial, with most Western countries repealing them.

However, even in jurisdictions that have decriminalised adultery, adultery may still have legal consequences, particularly in jurisdictions with fault-based divorce laws, where adultery almost always constitutes a ground for divorce and may be a factor in property settlement, the custody of children, the denial of alimony, etc. Adultery is not a ground for divorce in jurisdictions which have adopted a no-fault divorce model, but may still be a factor in child custody and property disputes.

International organizations have called for the decriminalising of adultery, especially in the light of several high-profile stoning cases that have occurred in some countries. The head of the United Nations expert body charged with identifying ways to eliminate laws that discriminate against women or are discriminatory to them in terms of implementation or impact, Kamala Chandrakirana, has stated that: &quot;Adultery must not be classified as a criminal offence at all&quot;. A joint statement by the United Nations Working Group on discrimination against women in law and in practice states that: &quot;Adultery as a criminal offence violates women’s human rights&quot;.

In Muslim countries that follow Sharia law for criminal justice, the punishment for adultery may be stoning. There are 15 countries in which stoning is authorized as lawful punishment, though in recent times it has been legally carried out only in Iran and Somalia. Most countries that criminalize adultery are those where the dominant religion is Islam, and several Sub-Saharan African Christian-majority countries, but there are some notable exceptions to this rule, namely, the Philippines and several U.S. states.

===Punishment===
In jurisdictions where adultery is illegal, punishments vary from fines (for example in the US state of Rhode Island) to caning in parts of Asia. In 15 countries the punishment includes stoning, although in recent times it has been legally enforced only in Iran and Somalia. Most stoning cases are the result of mob violence, and while technically illegal, no action is usually taken against perpetrators. Sometimes such stonings are ordered by informal village leaders who have &quot;de facto&quot; power in the community. Adultery may have consequences under civil law even in countries where it is not outlawed by the criminal law. For instance it may constitute &quot;fault&quot; in countries where the divorce law is fault based or it may be a ground for tort.

In some jurisdictions, the &quot;intruder&quot; (the third party) is punished, rather than the adulterous spouse. For instance art 266 of the Penal Code of South Sudan reads: &quot;Whoever, has consensual sexual intercourse with a man or woman who is and whom he or she has reason to believe to be the spouse of another person, commits the offence of adultery [...]&quot;. Similarly, under the adultery law in India (Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code, until overturned by the Supreme Court in 2018) it was a criminal offense for a man to have consensual sexual intercourse with a married woman, without the consent of her husband (no party was criminally punished in case of intercourse between a married man and an unmarried woman).

===Legal issues regarding paternity===
Historically, paternity of children born out of adultery has been seen as a major issue. Modern advances such as reliable contraception and paternity testing have changed the situation (in Western countries). Most countries nevertheless have a legal presumption that a woman&#x27;s husband is the father of her children who were born during that marriage. Although this is often merely a rebuttable presumption, many jurisdictions have laws which restrict the possibility of legal rebuttal (for instance by creating a legal time limit during which paternity may be challengedsuch as a certain number of years from the birth of the child). Establishing correct paternity may have major legal implications, for instance in regard to inheritance.

Children born out of adultery suffered, until recently, adverse legal and social consequences. In France, for instance, a law that stated that the inheritance rights of a child born under such circumstances were, on the part of the married parent, half of what they would have been under ordinary circumstances, remained in force until 2001, when France was forced to change it by a ruling of the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) (and in 2013, the ECtHR also ruled that the new 2001 regulations must be also applied to children born &quot;before&quot; 2001).

There has been, in recent years, a trend of legally favoring the right to a relation between the child and its biological father, rather than preserving the appearances of the &#x27;social&#x27; family. In 2010, the ECtHR ruled in favor of a German man who had fathered twins with a married woman, granting him right of contact with the twins, despite the fact that the mother and her husband had forbidden him from seeing the children.

===Criticism of adultery laws===
Laws against adultery have been named as invasive and incompatible with principles of limited government. Much of the criticism comes from libertarianism, the consensus among whose adherents is that government must not intrude into daily personal lives and that such disputes are to be settled privately rather than prosecuted and penalized by public entities. It is also argued that adultery laws are rooted in religious doctrines; which should not be the case for laws in a secular state.

Historically, in most cultures, laws against adultery were enacted only to prevent women—and not men—from having sexual relations with anyone other than their spouses, with adultery being often defined as sexual intercourse between a married woman and a man other than her husband. Among many cultures the penalty was—and to this day still is, as noted below—capital punishment. At the same time, men were free to maintain sexual relations with any women (polygyny) provided that the women did not already have husbands or &quot;owners&quot;. Indeed, (ba`al), Hebrew for &quot;husband&quot;, used throughout the Bible, is synonymous with &quot;owner&quot;. These laws were enacted in fear of cuckoldry and thus sexual jealousy. Many indigenous customs, such as female genital mutilation and even menstrual taboos, have been theorized to have originated as preventive measures against cuckolding. This arrangement has been deplored by many modern intellectuals.

Opponents of adultery laws argue that these laws maintain social norms which justify violence, discrimination and oppression of women; in the form of state sanctioned forms of violence such as stoning, flogging or hanging for adultery; or in the form of individual acts of violence committed against women by husbands or relatives, such as honor killings, crimes of passion, and beatings. UN Women has called for the decriminalization of adultery.

An argument against the criminal status of adultery is that the resources of the law enforcement are limited, and that they should be used carefully; by investing them in the investigation and prosecution of adultery (which is very difficult) the curbing of serious violent crimes may suffer.

Human rights organizations have stated that legislation on sexual crimes must be based on consent, and must recognize consent as central, and not trivialize its importance; doing otherwise can lead to legal, social or ethical abuses. Amnesty International, when condemning stoning legislation that targets adultery, among other acts, has referred to &quot;acts which should never be criminalized in the first place, including consensual sexual relations between adults&quot;. Salil Shetty, Amnesty International&#x27;s Secretary General, said: &quot;It is unbelievable that in the twenty-first century some countries are condoning child marriage and marital rape while others are outlawing abortion, sex outside marriage and same-sex sexual activityeven punishable by death.&quot; The &quot;My Body My Rights&quot; campaign has condemned state control over individual sexual and reproductive decisions; stating &quot;All over the world, people are coerced, criminalized and discriminated against, simply for making choices about their bodies and their lives&quot;.

==Consequences==

===General===
For various reasons, most couples who marry do so with the expectation of . Adultery is often seen as a breach of trust and of the commitment that had been made during the act of marriage. Adultery can be emotionally traumatic for both spouses and often results in divorce.

Adultery may lead to ostracization from certain religious or social groups.

Adultery can also lead to feelings of guilt and jealousy in the person with whom the affair is being committed. In some cases, this &quot;third person&quot; may encourage divorce (either openly or subtly). If the cheating spouse has hinted at divorce to continue the affair, the third person may feel deceived if that does not happen. They may simply withdraw with ongoing feelings of guilt, carry on an obsession with their lover, may choose to reveal the affair, or in rare cases, commit violence or other crimes.

There is correlation between divorces and children having struggles in later life.

===Sexually transmitted infections===

Like any sexual contact, extramarital sex opens the possibility of the introduction of sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) into a marriage. Since most married couples do not routinely use barrier contraceptives, STDs can be introduced to a marriage partner by a spouse engaging in unprotected extramarital sex. This can be a public health issue in regions of the world where STDs are common, but addressing this issue is very difficult due to legal and social barriersto openly talk about this situation would mean to acknowledge that adultery (often) takes place, something that is taboo in certain cultures, especially those strongly influenced by religion. In addition, dealing with the issue of barrier contraception in marriage in cultures where women have very few rights is difficult: the power of women to negotiate safer sex (or sex in general) with their husbands is often limited. The World Health Organization (WHO) found that women in violent relations were at increased risk of HIV/AIDS, because they found it very difficult to negotiate safe sex with their partners, or to seek medical advice if they thought they have been infected.

==Violence==

Historically, female adultery often resulted in extreme violence, including murder (of the woman, her lover, or both, committed by her husband). Today, domestic violence is outlawed in most countries.

Marital infidelity has been used, especially in the past, as a legal defence of provocation to a criminal charge, such as murder or assault. In some jurisdictions, the defence of provocation has been replaced by a partial defence or provocation or the behaviour of the victim can be invoked as a mitigating factor in sentencing.

In recent decades, feminists and women&#x27;s rights organizations have worked to change laws and social norms which tolerate crimes of passion against women. UN Women has urged states to review legal defenses of passion and provocation, and other similar laws, to ensure that such laws do not lead to impunity in regard to violence against women, stating that &quot;laws should clearly state that these defenses do not include or apply to crimes of &quot;honour&quot;, adultery, or domestic assault or murder.&quot;

The Council of Europe Recommendation Rec(2002)5 of the Committee of Ministers to member states on the protection of women against violence states that member states should &quot;preclude adultery as an excuse for violence within the family&quot;.

===Honor killings===

Honor killings are often connected to accusations of adultery. Honor killings continue to be practiced in some parts of the world, particularly (but not only) in parts of South Asia and the Middle East. Honor killings are treated leniently in some legal systems. Honor killings have also taken place in immigrant communities in Europe, Canada, and the U.S. In some parts of the world, honor killings enjoy considerable public support: in one survey, 33.4% of teenagers in Jordan&#x27;s capital city, Amman, approved of honor killings. A survey in Diyarbakir, Turkey, found that, when asked the appropriate punishment for a woman who has committed adultery, 37% of respondents said she should be killed, while 21% said her nose or ears should be cut off.

Until 2009, in Syria, it was legal for a husband to kill or injure his wife or his female relatives caught in flagrante delicto committing adultery or other illegitimate sexual acts. The law has changed to allow the perpetrator to only &quot;benefit from the attenuating circumstances, provided that he serves a prison term of no less than two years in the case of killing.&quot; Other articles also provide for reduced sentences. Article 192 states that a judge may opt for reduced punishments (such as short-term imprisonment) if the killing was done with an honorable intent. Article 242 says that a judge may reduce a sentence for murders that were done in rage and caused by an illegal act committed by the victim. In recent years, Jordan has amended its Criminal Code to modify its laws which used to offer a complete defense for honor killings.

According to the UN in 2002:

:&quot;The report of the Special Rapporteur ... concerning cultural practices in the family that are violent towards women (E/CN.4/2002/83), indicated that honour killings had been reported in Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Pakistan, the Syrian Arab Republic, Turkey, Yemen, and other Mediterranean and Persian Gulf countries, and that they had also taken place in western countries such as France, Germany and the United Kingdom, within migrant communities.&quot;

===Crimes of passion===

Crimes of passion are often triggered by jealousy, and, according to Human Rights Watch, &quot;have a similar dynamic [to honor killings] in that the women are killed by male family members and the crimes are perceived as excusable or understandable.&quot;

===Stoning===
Stoning, or lapidation, refers to a form of capital punishment whereby an organized group throws stones at an individual until the person dies, or the condemned person is pushed from a platform set high enough above a stone floor that the fall would probably result in instantaneous death.

Stoning continues to be practiced today, in parts of the world. Recently, several people have been sentenced to death by stoning after being accused of adultery in Iran, Somalia, Afghanistan, Sudan, Mali, and Pakistan by tribal courts.

===Flogging===

In some jurisdictions flogging is a punishment for adultery. There are also incidents of extrajudicial floggings, ordered by informal religious courts. In 2011, a 14-year-old girl in Bangladesh died after being publicly lashed, when she was accused of having an affair with a married man. Her punishment was ordered by villagers under Sharia law.

===Violence between the partners of an adulterous couple===
Married people who form relations with extramarital partners or people who engage in relations with partners married to somebody else may be subjected to violence in these relations. Because of the nature of adulteryillicit or illegal in many societiesthis type of intimate partner violence may go underreported or may not be prosecuted when it is reported; and in some jurisdictions this type of violence is not covered by the specific domestic violence laws meant to protect persons in legitimate couples.

==In fiction==
The theme of adultery has been used in many literary works, and has served as a theme for notable books such as &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;, &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;, &quot;Lady Chatterley&#x27;s Lover&quot;, &quot;The Scarlet Letter&quot; and &quot;Adultery&quot;. It has also been the theme of many movies.

<doc id="58810" wikidata="Q570532" url="?curid=58810" title="Gnaeus Marcius Coriolanus">
<text>Gnaeus (or Gaius) Marcius Coriolanus was a Roman general who is said to have lived in the 5th century BC. He received his toponymic cognomen &quot;Coriolanus&quot; following his courageous actions during a Roman siege of the Volscian city of Corioli. He was subsequently exiled from Rome, and led troops of Rome&#x27;s enemy the Volsci to besiege the city.

In later ancient times, it was generally accepted by historians that Coriolanus was a real historical individual, and a consensus narrative story of his life appeared, retold by leading historians such as Livy, Plutarch, and Dionysius of Halicarnassus. More recent scholarship has cast doubt on the historicity of Coriolanus, with some portraying him as either a wholly legendary figure or at least disputing the accuracy of the conventional story of his life or the timing of the events.

According to Plutarch, his ancestors included prominent patricians such as Censorinus and even an early King of Rome.

The story is the basis for the tragedy of &quot;Coriolanus&quot;, written by William Shakespeare, and a number of other works, including Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Coriolan Overture&quot; (based not on Shakespeare but on the play &quot;Coriolan&quot; by Heinrich Joseph von Collin).

==Consensus biography==
===Name===
Coriolanus&#x27;s first name is traditionally given as Gnaeus; this was the form given by the historian Livy and by later Latin authors. The Greek author Dionysius of Halicarnassus, on the other hand, calls him Gaius, which was followed by Plutarch and then Shakespeare. Ogilvie suggests Dionysius may have followed a separate tradition originated from the annalist Licinius Macer.

===Siege of Corioli===
Coriolanus came to fame as a young man serving in the army of the consul Postumus Cominius in 493 BC during the siege of the Volscian town of Corioli. While the Romans were focused on the siege, another Volscian force arrived from Antium and attacked the Romans, and at the same time the soldiers of Corioli launched a sally. Marcius held watch at the time of the Volscian attack. He quickly gathered a small force of Roman soldiers to fight against the Volscians who had sallied forth from Corioli. Not only did he repel the enemy, but he also charged through the town gates and then began setting fire to some of the houses bordering the town wall. The citizens of Corioli cried out, and the whole Volscian force was dispirited and defeated by the Romans. The town was captured, and Marcius gained the cognomen Coriolanus.

===Conflict and exile===
In 491 BC, two years after Coriolanus&#x27; victory over the Volscians, Rome was recovering from a grain shortage. A significant quantity of grain was imported from Sicily, and the senate debated the manner in which it should be distributed to the commoners. Coriolanus advocated that grain should be provided only upon the reversal of the pro-plebeian political reforms arising from the first &quot;secessio plebis&quot; in 494 BC.

The senate thought Coriolanus&#x27; proposal was too harsh. The populace were incensed at Coriolanus&#x27; proposal, and the tribunes put him on trial. The senators argued for the acquittal of Coriolanus, or at the least a merciful sentence. Coriolanus refused to attend on the day of his trial, and was convicted.

===Defection to the Volsci===
Coriolanus fled to the Volsci in exile. He was received and treated kindly, and resided with the Volscian leader Attius Tullus Aufidius.

Plutarch&#x27;s account of his defection tells that Coriolanus donned a disguise and entered the home of Aufidius as a supplicant.

Coriolanus and Aufidius then persuaded the Volscians to break their truce with Rome and raise an army to invade. Livy recounts that Aufidius tricked the Roman senate into expelling the Volsci from Rome during the celebration of the Great Games, thereby stirring up ill-will among the Volsci.

Coriolanus and Aufidius led the Volscian army against Roman towns, colonies and allies. Roman colonists were expelled from Circeii. They then retook the formerly Volscian towns of Satricum, Longula, Pollusca and Corioli. Then the Volscian army took Lavinium, then Corbio, Vitellia, Trebia, Lavici, and Pedum.

From there the Volsci marched on Rome and besieged it. The Volscians initially camped at the Cluilian trench, five miles outside Rome, and ravaged the countryside. Coriolanus directed the Volsci to target plebeian properties and to spare those of the patricians.

The consuls, now Spurius Nautius and Sextus Furius, readied the defences of the city. But the plebeians implored them to sue for peace. The senate was convened, and it was agreed to send supplicants to the enemy. Initially ambassadors were sent, but Coriolanus sent back a negative response. The ambassadors were sent to the Volsci a second time, but were refused entry to the enemy camp. Next priests, in their regalia, were sent by the Romans, but achieved nothing more than had the ambassadors.

Then Coriolanus&#x27; mother Veturia (known as Volumnia in Shakespeare&#x27;s play) and his wife Volumnia (known as Virgilia in Shakespeare&#x27;s play) and his two sons, together with the matrons of Rome, went out to the Volscian camp and implored Coriolanus to cease his attack on Rome. Coriolanus was overcome by their pleas, and moved the Volscian camp back from the city, ending the siege. Rome honoured the service of these women by the erection of a temple dedicated to Fortuna (a female deity).

Coriolanus&#x27; fate after this point is unclear, but it seems he took no further part in the war.

One version says that Coriolanus retired to Aufidius&#x27; home town of Antium. Coriolanus had committed acts of disloyalty to both Rome and the Volsci, and Aufidius raised support to have Coriolanus first put on trial by the Volscians, and then assassinated before the trial had ended.

Plutarch&#x27;s tale of Coriolanus&#x27; appeal to Aufidius is quite similar to a tale from the life of Themistocles, a leader of the Athenian democracy who was a contemporary of Coriolanus. During Themistocles&#x27; exile from Athens, he travelled to the home of Admetus, King of the Molossians, a man who was his personal enemy. Themistocles came to Admetus in disguise and appealed to him as a fugitive, just as Coriolanus appealed to Aufidius. Themistocles, however, never attempted military retaliation against Athens.

==Modern scepticism==
Some modern scholars question parts of the story of Coriolanus. It is notable that accounts of Coriolanus&#x27; life are first found in works from the third century BC, some two hundred years after Coriolanus&#x27; life, and there are few authoritative historical records prior to the Gallic sack of Rome in 390 BC. Whether or not Coriolanus himself is a historical figure, the saga preserves a genuine popular memory of the dark, unhappy decades of the early 5th century BC when the Volscians overran Latium and threatened the very existence of Rome.

==Cultural references==
Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Coriolanus&quot; is the last of his &quot;Roman plays&quot;. Its portrayal of the hero has led to a long tradition of political interpretation of Coriolanus as an anti-populist, or even proto-fascist leader. Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s version of &quot;Coriolanus&quot; (1951) stresses this aspect. Shakespeare&#x27;s play also forms the basis of the 2011 motion picture &quot;Coriolanus&quot;, starring and directed by Ralph Fiennes, in which Coriolanus is the protagonist.

John Dennis&#x27;s play &quot;The Invader of His Country&quot; was staged at the Drury Lane Theatre in 1719. Inspired by Shakespeare&#x27;s work, it made reference to the recent Jacobite uprisings against the Hanoverian Succession.

Heinrich Joseph von Collin&#x27;s 1804 play &quot;Coriolan&quot; portrayed him in the context of German romantic ideas of the tragic hero. Beethoven&#x27;s 1807 &quot;Coriolan Overture&quot; was written for a production of the von Collin play.
T. S. Eliot wrote a sequence of poems in 1931 entitled &quot;Coriolan&quot;.

&quot;Thunder of Battle&quot; is a 1963 Italian film based on the legend of Coriolanus.

Steven Saylor&#x27;s 2007 novel &quot;Roma&quot; presents Coriolanus as a plebeian, the child of a patrician mother and plebeian father. His attitudes toward the changes occurring in Rome during his lifetime are reflective of what has been described. He achieves Senatorial status thanks to his military valour and connections. When he calls for the abolition of the office of tribune, he becomes a target of the plebeians and their representatives. He flees before the trial which would ruin him and his family socially and financially, and seeks the alliance with the Volsci described above. His military campaign against Rome is successful and his forces are approaching the walls of the city until the appeal of the Roman women, including his patrician mother and his wife. When he orders his troops to withdraw, he is killed by them.

&quot;The 48 Laws of Power&quot; uses Coriolanus as an example of violating Law no. 4: &quot;Always Say Less Than Necessary&quot;, citing his constant insulting of the plebeians as the reason for his exile.

In Suzanne Collins&#x27; novel series &quot;The Hunger Games&quot; the lead antagonist is named Coriolanus Snow. The prequel, &quot;The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes&quot;, focuses solely on Coriolanus Snow, and Collins then references the similarities between the historical Coriolanus and the fictional Coriolanus.

<text>Teff (), also known as Eragrostis tef, Williams lovegrass, or annual bunch grass, is an annual grass, a species of lovegrass native to Ethiopia, where it first originated in the Ethiopian Highlands. It is cultivated for its edible seeds, also known as teff. Teff was one of the earliest plants domesticated. It is one of the most important staple crops in Ethiopia.

==Description==
&quot;Eragrostis tef&quot; is a self pollinated tetraploid annual cereal grass. Teff is a plant, which allows it to more efficiently fix carbon in drought and high temperatures, and is an intermediate between a tropical and temperate grass. The name teff is thought to originate from the Amharic word &quot;teffa&quot;, which means &quot;lost&quot;. This probably refers to its tiny seeds, which have a diameter smaller than . Teff is a fine-stemmed, tufted grass with large crowns and many tillers. Its roots are shallow, but develop a massive fibrous rooting system. The plant height varies depending on the cultivation variety and the environmental conditions. As with many ancient crops, teff is quite adaptive and can grow in various environmental conditions; particularly, teff can be cultivated in dry environments, but also under wet conditions on marginal soils.

Teff originated in the Ethiopian Highlands, and it is one of the most important cereals in Ethiopia and Eritrea. It is grown for its edible seeds and also for its straw to feed the cattle. The seeds are very small, about a millimeter in length, and a thousand grains weigh approximately . They can have a color from a white to a deep reddish brown. Teff is similar to millet and quinoa in cooking, but the seed is much smaller and cooks faster, thus using less fuel.

==Distribution==
Teff is mainly cultivated in Ethiopia and Eritrea. It is one of the most important staple crops in these two countries, where it is used to make injera. In 2016, Ethiopia grew more than 90 percent of the world&#x27;s teff. It is now also marginally cultivated in India, Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and the US, particularly in Idaho, California, Texas, and Nevada. Because of its very small seeds, a handful is enough to sow a large area. This property makes teff particularly suited to a seminomadic lifestyle.

==History==
Teff is believed to have originated in Ethiopia between 4000 BC and 1000 BC. Genetic evidence points to &quot;E. pilosa&quot; as the most likely wild ancestor. A 19th-century identification of teff seeds from an ancient Egyptian site is now considered doubtful; the seeds in question (no longer available for study) are more likely of &quot;E. aegyptiaca&quot;, a common wild grass in Egypt.

Teff is the most important commodity produced and consumed in Ethiopia where the flat pancake-like injera provides a livelihood for around 6.5 million small farmers in the country. In 2006, the Ethiopian government outlawed the export of raw teff, fearing export-driven domestic shortages like those suffered by South American countries after the explosion of quinoa consumption in Europe and the US. Processed teff, namely injera, could still be exported and was mainly bought by the Ethiopian and Eritrean diaspora living in northern Europe, the Middle East and North America. After a few years, fears of a domestic shortage of teff in the scenario of an international market opening decreased. Teff yields had been increasing by 40 to 50% over the five previous years while prices had remained stable in Ethiopia. This led the government to partially lift the export ban in 2015. To ensure that the domestic production would not be minimized, the export licenses have only been granted to 48 commercial farmers which had not cultivated the plant before. Lack of mechanization is a barrier to potential increases in teff exports. Yet the increasing demand, rising by 7–10% per year, and the subsequent increase in exports is encouraging the country to speed up the modernization of agriculture and is also boosting research. Because of its potential as an economic success, a few other countries, including the US and some European countries, are already cultivating teff and selling it on domestic markets.

==Uses==

Teff is a multipurpose crop which has a high importance for the Ethiopian diet and culture. In Ethiopia, teff provides two-thirds of the daily protein intake. It is not only important for human nutrition, but also as fodder for livestock, or as building material. Teff is the main ingredient to prepare injera, a sourdough-risen flatbread. During meals, it is often eaten with meat or ground pulses. Sometimes it is also eaten as porridge. Moreover, teff can be used to prepare alcoholic drinks, called &quot;arak&#x27;e&quot; or &quot;katikalla&quot; or beer, called &quot;t&#x27;ella&quot; or &quot;fersso&quot;. Finally, due to its high mineral content, teff is also mixed with soybeans, chickpeas or other grains to manufacture baby foods.

According to a study in Ethiopia, farmers indicated a preference among consumers for white teff over darker colored varieties. As a nutritious fodder, teff is used to feed ruminants in Ethiopia and horses in the United States. It is a source of animal feed, especially during the dry season, and it is often preferred over straw from other cereals. Teff grass can be used as a construction material when mixed with mud to plaster the walls of local grain storage facilities.

==Ecology==
Teff is adaptable and it can grow in various environments, at altitudes ranging from sea level to . However, it does not tolerate frost. Highest yields are obtained when teff is grown between , with an annual rainfall of , and daily temperatures range from . Yields decrease when annual rainfall falls below 250 mm and when the average temperature during pollination exceeds 22 °C. Despite its superficial root system, teff is quite drought-resistant thanks to its ability to regenerate rapidly after a moderate water stress and to produce fruits in a short time span. It is daylight-sensitive and flowers best with 12 hours of daylight. Teff is usually cultivated on pH neutral soils, but it was noticed that it could sustain acidity up to a pH below 5. Teff has a C4 photosynthesis mechanism.

==Cultivation==
The cultivation of teff is labor-intensive and the small size of its seeds makes it difficult to handle and transport without loss. In Ethiopia, teff is mostly produced during the main rain season, between July and November. It is known as an &quot;emergency crop&quot; because it is planted late in the season, when the temperatures are warmer, and most other crops have already been planted. Teff germination generally occurs 3–12 days after sowing. Optimal germination temperatures range from 15 to 35 °C; below 10 °C, germination almost does not occur. Teff is traditionally sown or broadcast by hand, on firm, humid soil. Usual sowing density ranges from 15 to 20 kg/ha, though farmers can sow up to 50 kg/ha, because the seeds are hard to spread equally and a higher sowing density helps to reduce weed competition at the early stage. Seeds are either left at the soil surface or slightly covered by a thin layer of soil, but must not be planted at a depth greater than 1 cm. The field can be subsequently rolled. Sowing can also be done mechanically; row planting reduces lodging.

Recommended fertilization doses are 25–60 kg/ha for N, and 10–18 kg/ha for P. Teff responds more to nitrogen than to phosphorus; thus, high nitrogen inputs increase the biomass production and size of the plants, thereby increasing lodging. To avoid this, farmers can decrease nitrogen input, cultivate teff after a legume crop or adjust sowing time so that the rains have stopped when the crop reaches heading stage. In Ethiopia, teff is commonly used in crop rotations with other cereals and legumes.
Teff is harvested 2–6 months after sowing, when the vegetative parts start to turn yellow. If teff is harvested past its maturation, seeds will fall off, especially in windy or rainy weather conditions. In Ethiopia, harvest lasts from November to January; harvest is usually done manually, with sickles. Farmers cut the plants at the soil surface, pile them up in the field and transport them to the threshing area. Teff is traditionally threshed by using animals walking on the harvest. Alternatively, some farmers rent threshing machines used for other cereals. The seeds are easy to store, as they are resistant to most pests during storage. Teff seeds can stay viable several years if direct contact with humidity and sun is avoided. Average yields in Ethiopia reach around two tonnes per ha. One single inflorescence can produce up to 1000 seeds, and one plant up to 10,000. Moreover, teff offers some promising opportunities for breeding programs: the first draft of the &quot;Eragrostis tef&quot; genome was published in 2014 and research institutes have started selecting for more resistant varieties. In 1996, the US National Research Council characterized teff as having the &quot;potential to improve nutrition, boost food security, foster rural development and support sustainable landcare.&quot;

===Challenges and prospects===
The major challenges in teff production are its low yield and high susceptibility to lodging. Efforts to conventionally breed teff towards higher yields started in the 1950s and led to an average annual increase in yield of 0.8%. However, no considerable improvements concerning the susceptibility of lodging have been made, due mainly to low demand outside of Ethiopia and Eritrea.

High-yielding varieties, such as &quot;Quencho&quot;, were widely adopted by farmers in Ethiopia. Sequencing of the teff genome improved breeding, and an ethyl methanesulphonate (EMS)-mutagenized population was then used to breed the first semi-dwarf lodging-tolerant teff line, called &quot;kegne&quot;. In 2015, researchers tested 28 new teff varieties and identified three promising lines that generated yields of up to 4.7 tonnes per ha.

The &quot;Teff Improvement Project&quot; marked a milestone by releasing the first teff variety &quot;Tesfa&quot; to the Ethiopian markets in March 2017. Areas of further development include: &quot;(i) improving productivity of teff; (ii) overcoming the lodging malady; (iii) developing climate-smart and appropriate crop and soil management options; (iv) developing tolerance to abiotic stresses such as drought and soil acidity; (v) developing suitable pre- and post-harvest mechanization technologies suitable for smallholder farmers as well as commercial farms; (vi) food processing and nutrition aspects with special attention to the development of different food recipes and value-added products; (vii) developing crop protection measures against diseases, insect pests and weeds; and (viii) improving or strengthening socio-economics and agricultural extension services.&quot;

===Pests===
The tef shoot fly (&quot;Atherigona hyalinipennis&quot;) is a major pest of the crop.

Other insect pests include:

*central shoot fly &quot;Delia arambourgi&quot; (seedling feeder)
*Wello-bush cricket &quot;Decticoides brevipennis&quot; (flower feeder)
*red tef worm &quot;Mentaxya ignicollis&quot;
*tef epilachna beetle &quot;Chnootriba similis&quot; (leaf feeder); also transmits rice yellow mottle virus in rice
*chrysomelid black beetle &quot;Erlangerius niger&quot; (adults feed on developing grains and leaves)
*stem-boring wasp &quot;Eurytomocharis eragrostidis&quot; in the United States

==Nutritional value==
Uncooked teff is 9% water, 73% carbohydrates, 13% protein, and 2% fat. Cooked teff is 75% water, 20% carbohydrates, 4% protein, and less than 1% fat (table). A reference serving of cooked teff provides of food energy, is a rich source of protein, dietary fiber, and manganese, and contains moderate amounts of thiamin, phosphorus, iron, magnesium, and zinc (table). The fiber content in teff is also higher than in most other cereals.

Teff is gluten free, and a method has been developed to process teff into a flour with a wider range of baking applications, such as for bread and pasta. 

==Patent and bio-piracy==
In 2003, a Dutch company, Health and Performance Food International (HPFI), paired with the Ethiopian Institute of Biodiversity Conservation to introduce teff to European markets. The original agreement was for Ethiopia to provide HPFI with a dozen strains of teff to market globally, and the two entities would split the proceeds.

HPFI&#x27;s CEO, Jans Roosjen, had taken out two patents on teff in 2003 and 2007, claiming that his way of milling and storing the flour was unique. HPFI went bankrupt in 2009, allowing Roosjen to continue to utilize those patents and the marketing rights for the grain while being freed from the original agreement with Ethiopia. Ethiopia only received 4,000 euros over five years of collaboration.

Roosjen ended up suing a Dutch bakery company, Bakers, for patent infringement because they were selling teff baked goods. The Dutch patent office declared that the patent was void, citing that the methods used to bake and mix flours were &quot;general professional knowledge&quot;. The deadline for Roosjen to appeal the decision expired in 2019, officially allowing Ethiopia access to Dutch teff markets.

However, Roosjen&#x27;s company Ancientgrains BV still maintains patent rights in Belgium, Germany, Britain, Austria and Italy.

Teff is inherent to Ethiopia&#x27;s national culture and identity, and the government of Ethiopia has expressed intent to hold Roosjen accountable to the fullest extent of international patent law, as well as to regain ownership over international markets of its most important food.

<text>Zula ግእዝ ዙላ saba ሰብኣ 𐩸𐩡 is a small town in central Eritrea. It is situated near the head of Annesley Bay (also known as the Gulf of Zula), on the Red Sea coast. Four kilometers away is the archeological site of Adulis, which was an emporium and the port of Axum.

==History==
The Eritrean Research Project Team composed of Eritrean, Canadian, American, Dutch and French scientists discovered a Paleolithic site with stone and obsidian tools dated to over 125,000 years old south of Massawa, along the Red Sea littoral. The tools are believed to have been used by early humans to harvest marine resources like clams and oysters.

The Kingdom of Aksum was a powerful trading empire centered in northern Ethiopia and Eritrea. It existed from approximately 100–940 AD, growing from the proto-Aksumite D&#x27;mt, of the Iron Age period c. 4th century BC to achieve prominence by the 1st century AD.

An important trade route led from Adulis, then on the coast, to the capital of the kingdom, Aksum, located in the Tigray Region of Ethiopia.

In 1857, an agreement was entered into by the Dejazmach of Tigray, in revolt against Emperor Tewodros II of Ethiopia, to cede Zula to the French. Agew Niguse was defeated by Emperor Tewodros, and the commander of a French cruiser sent to Annesley Bay in 1859 found the country in a state of anarchy. No further steps were taken by France to assert its sovereignty, and Zula with the neighbouring coast passed, nominally, to Egypt in 1866. Zula was the place where Robert Napier&#x27;s British expedition of 1867 – 1868 against Tewodros disembarked, Annesley Bay affording safe and ample anchorage for the largest ocean-going vessels. A road was built by the British from Zula to Senafe in the Eritrean Highlands.

The authority of Egypt having lapsed over Zula, an Italian protectorate was proclaimed in 1888, and in 1890 the town was incorporated into the colony of Eritrea. Along with Afta and Irafalo, it remains an important trade center for the Saho people.

==Geography==
Zula is a village on the Red Sea in central Eritrea. It stands on the right bank of the Aligede River, on a narrow coastal plain on the west side of the Gulf of Zula, some to the east of Asmara. The coast here is lined with mangroves, and there is an aircraft landing strip to the north.

The original port of Adulis is now inland, debris washed down from the mountains having accumulated along the coastline, extending it further out to sea. Napier built limited port facilities at Zula to enable his expedition; the remains of the railway tracks, laid by Napier&#x27;s Expedition to haul his heavy equipment ashore, can still be seen. However, modern port services are handled at Massawa.

<doc id="58816" wikidata="Q14436" url="?curid=58816" title="Lake Zug">
<text>Lake Zug () is a lake in Central Switzerland, situated between Lake Lucerne and Lake Zurich. It stretches for between Arth and the Cham-Zug bay. The Lorze as the main feeder river empties its waters into the lake at its northern extremity, but further west issues from the lake to pursue its course towards the Reuss. Due to this poor feeding, Environmental protection is very important as the lake would suffer long term damage if polluted as the second of the rivers, &quot;Rigiaa&quot;, feeds only a marginal amount into the lake at its southern end. Already a great part of the fauna in the deep parts of the lake has been lost.

==Background==
The lake is mostly within the borders of the Canton of Zug, with about at its southern end in the canton Schwyz, while the Canton of Lucerne claims about to the north of Immensee. Toward the south-west extremity of the lake the Rigi descends rather steeply to the water&#x27;s edge, while part of its east shore forms a narrow level band at the foot of the Rossberg, and the Zugerberg. The culminating point of the lake&#x27;s drainage basin is the summit of the Rigi at .

At its northern end, the shores are nearly level, while on the west shore the wooded promontory of Buonas (with its castles, old and new) projects picturesquely into the waters. The principal place on the lake is the town of Zug. Three railways follow the shore of the lake, one from Zürich via Zug and Arth-Goldau to Saint-Gotthard, one from Lucerne via Arth-Goldau to Saint-Gotthard, and the third from Zürich via Zug to Lucerne.

Many fish (including pike and carp of considerable weights) are taken in the lake, which is especially famous for an endemic kind of trout (&quot;Salmo salvelinus&quot;, locally called &quot;Rolheli&quot;).

== History ==
The first steamer was placed on the lake in 1852.

In the early 20th century, a railway (formerly part of the St. Gotthard main route) ran along its eastern shore past Walchwil to Arth at its south end, which was connected initially by a steam tramway with the Arth-Goldau station of the St. Gotthard line. This line runs from Arth along the western shore to Immensee, where it bears south-west to Lucerne, while from Immensee another railway leads (at first some way from the shore) to Cham, west of Zug.

== Settlements ==
*Arth
**Gängigen
*Buonas
*Cham
*Chämleten
*Immensee
*Risch
*Walchwil

==Public Transportation ==

Public transportation on Lake Zug is done by the Zugersee Schifffahrt / Schifffahrtsgesellschaft für den Zugersee AG (SGZ) .

<text>Zug ( , ; ; ; ; ) is the largest town and capital of the Swiss canton of Zug. Zug is renowned as a hub for some of the wealthiest individuals in the world and is known for its high concentration of wealth.

The municipality had a total population of on . The official language of Zug is the Swiss variety of Standard German, but the main spoken language is the local variant of the Alemannic Swiss German dialect.

==Etymology==
Its name, translating from German as &quot;pull&quot; or &quot;tug&quot;, originates from the fishing vocabulary; in the Middle Ages it referred to the right to &quot;pull up&quot; fishing nets and hence to the right to fish. 

==History==


===Prehistory===
The oldest evidence of humans in the area trace back to 14,000 BC. There have been Paleolithic finds on the north bank of Lake Zug, which come from nomadic hunters and gatherers. Archaeologists have also found over forty lake-shore settlements, known as pile dwellings, on the shores of Lake Zug from the epoch of the first settled farmers in the Neolithic period (5,500-2,200 BC). The peak in these lake-shore village settlements was between 3800 and 2450 BC. For the same epoch, the first pre-alpine land use has been found in Menzingen and in the Ägeri valley. The well-known, historically researched lake-shore village &quot;″Sumpf″&quot; (the swamp), dated from the late Bronze Age (up until 850 BC). Evidence from these finds resulted in a quite different picture of life in former times, which is on display at the Zug Museum for Prehistory. In addition, finds from the Iron Age (850-50 BC) and the Roman and Celtic-Roman time (from 50 BC) have been unearthed.

===Kyburg foundation===
In around AD 600, Alemannic families and tribes migrated to the area of present-day canton Zug. The name Blickensdorf, and place names with &#x27;-ikon&#x27; endings, prove this as the first Alemannic living space. The churches of Baar and Risch also date back to the early Middle Ages. The first written document on the area originates from the year 858, and refers to King Ludwig the German giving the farm &quot;Chama&quot; (Cham) to the Zürich Fraumünster convent. At this time, the area of present-day Zug belonged to completely different monastic and secular landlords, the most important of whom were the Habsburgs, and who, in 1264, inherited the Kyburg rights and remained a central political power until about 1400.

In the course of the high medieval town construction, the settlement of Zug also received a town wall at some point after 1200. The town founders were probably the counts of Kyburg. The town, first mentioned in AD 1240, was called an &quot;oppidum&quot; in 1242 and a &quot;castrum&quot; in 1255. In 1273, it was bought by Rudolph of Habsburg from Anna, the heiress of Kyburg and wife of Eberhard, head of the cadet line of Habsburg. Through this purchase it passed into the control of the Habsburgs and was placed under a Habsburg bailiff. The &quot;Aeusser Amt&quot; or Outer District consisted of the villages and towns surrounding Zug, which each had their own &quot;Landsgemeinden&quot; but were ruled by a single Habsburg bailiff. Zug was important as an administrative center of the Kyburg and the Habsburg district, then as a local market place, and, thereafter, as a stage town for the transport of goods (particularly salt and iron) over the Hirzel hill towards Lucerne.

===Joining the Swiss Confederation===
On 27 June 1352, both the town of Zug and the &quot;Aeusser Amt&quot; entered the Swiss Confederation, the latter being received on exactly the same terms as the town, and not, as was usual in the case of outer districts, as a subject land. However, in September 1352 Zug had to acknowledge its own lords again, and in 1355 was obliged to break off its connection with the league. About 1364, the town and the Aeusser Amt were recovered for the league by the men of Schwyz, and from this time Zug took part as a full member in all the acts of the league. In 1379, the Holy Roman Emperor Wenceslaus exempted Zug from all external jurisdictions, and in 1389 the Habsburgs renounced their claims, reserving only an annual payment of 20 silver marks, which came to an end in 1415. In 1400 Wenceslaus gave all criminal jurisdiction to the town only. The Aeusser Amt, in 1404, then claimed that the banner and seal of Zug should be kept in one of the country districts and were supported in this claim by Schwyz. The matter was finally settled in 1412 by arbitration, and the banner was to be kept in the town. Finally in 1415, the right of electing their &quot;landammann&quot; was given to Zug by the Confederation, and a share in the criminal jurisdiction was granted to the Aeusser Amt by German king Sigismund.

The alliance of the four forest cantons of Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden and Lucerne with the city of Zürich in 1351 set much in motion. The town of Zug was seen as having Habsburg ties with the cities of Zürich and Lucerne, and therefore had to be conquered. It is likely that this was more for political than economic reasons: the Lucerne market was very important for central Switzerland, but also strongly dependent on the city of Zürich. Zürich initiated a siege on Zug with the federal army in June 1352. Zug surrendered. On 27 June 1352 Zürich, Luzern, Zug, Uri, Schwyz and Unterwalden formed an alliance. Zürich&#x27;s saw this &#x27;Zugerbund&#x27; (Zug alliance) as an alliance of convenience. For the town of Zug, little changed, and Zug remained Habsburg. That same year, the Zug alliance was declared invalid by all parties. A period of Schwyz domination then followed. Only gradually did Zug become sovereign and federal.

Simultaneously, Zug expanded its territory, acquiring a number of rural areas in the form of bailiwicks (Walchwil, Cham, Gangolfswil [Risch] Hünenberg and Steinhausen, and Oberrüti, now part of the canton of Aargau). Zug became a confederation in itself – with the town and its subject territories, and the three outer (&#x27;free&#x27;) municipalities, Ägeri, Menzingen (with Neuheim) and Baar. This problematic dualism dominated until 1798, i.e. until the end of the old confederation, the political structure of the Canton Zug. The unifying element of this miniature confederation was, among others, the rural municipalities and the forty-member city council.

===Growth of the town===
In 1385, Zug joined the league of the Swabian cities against Leopold III of Austria and shared in the victory of Sempach, as well as in the various Argovian (1415) and Thurgovian (1460) conquests of the Confederates, and later in those of Italy (1512), having already taken part in the occupation of the Val d&#x27;Ossola. Between 1379 (Walchwil) and 1477 (Cham), Zug had acquired various districts in its own neighborhood, principally to the north and the west, which were ruled till 1798 by the town alone as subject lands.

In 1478, the building of a larger town wall began, which increased the town area six-fold – the same year as the building of the late gothic St. Oswald Church began. The building master of the new town wall was Hans Felder from Bavarian Swabia. The ground plan of the town wall is indicative of an ideal symmetric plan of the Renaissance period – something very rare at that time. The overall urban planning implemented in the small town of Zug was modern for its time.

===The Reformation and early modern era===
During the turmoil of the Reformation, Zug remained on the Catholic side of central Switzerland and retained the old faith. Warring religious confederates fought at Kappel am Albis (1531) and at Gubel in Menzingen. Its location on the edge of central Switzerland made Zug a confessional border town. During the Reformation, Zug clung to the old faith and was a member of the &quot;Christliche Vereinigung&quot; of 1529. In 1586, it became a member of the Golden League.

The period up until 1798 was marked by internal political rivalries and turbulence. The invasion of the French troops marked the end of the old order, and with the Helvetic order came a radical political change. Zug became part of the canton Waldstätten, and the cantonal capital for a short time. After a 50-year struggle between federalism and centralism, between confederation and central state, between conservative and liberal-radical vision, in 1848, today&#x27;s federal government of Switzerland emerged. Zug was given its current cantonal structure, consisting of eleven local municipalities.

===Industrialisation and internationalisation===
Until well into the 19th century, Zug consisted of agricultural land. Actual industrialization began with the entrepreneur Wolfgang Henggeler, who in 1834 built a cotton mill in Unterägeri. This was followed by the two companies in Neuägeri and Baar. In 1866, the American George Ham Page founded the first European condensed milk factory in Cham, which later merged with Nestlé. Industry in Zug was dominated by the company Landis+Gyr, founded in 1896, and now owned by Toshiba. The connection to the Swiss railway network in 1864 was important, as was the connection of mountain and valley with an electric tram at the beginning of the 20th century.

In the second half of the century, dynamic expansion took place and Zug became a national and international financial and trading centre, aided by its proximity to Zürich, and by an attractive tax policy. In parallel, large industrial and commercial zones evolved; employment increased rapidly; the population rose sharply, and the building boom skyrocketed. Canton Zug catapulted itself into being at the top of the financially strong cantons. And the town today has become, as the British Guardian once wrote, &#x27;a compass of the global economy&#x27;.

===Today===
Zug is a low tax region and is headquarters for a number of multinational enterprises. The Expat City Ranking in 2019, based on a study of more than 20,000 respondents, rated the quality of life in Zug highest among all cities in the survey. The town&#x27;s best-known agricultural product is Kirsch. 

On 27 September 2001, a mentally-ill 57-year-old resident shot 32 people, killing 14 before killing himself in the cantonal parliament building (Parlamentsgebäude Zug).

==Geography==
===Topography===

Zug has an area (as of the 2004 survey) of . Of this area, about 33.1% is used for agricultural purposes, while 37.9% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 26.6% is settled (buildings or roads) and 2.5% is unproductive land.

The older part of the town is rather crowded together, though only four of the wall towers and a small part of the town walls still survive.

The most striking old building in the town is the parish church of St Oswald (late 15th century), dedicated to St Oswald, king of Northumbria (d. 642), one of whose arms was brought to Zug in 1485. The town hall, also a 15th-century building, now houses the Historical and Antiquarian Museum. There are some quaint old painted houses close by. A little way higher up the hillside is a Capuchin convent in a striking position, close to the town wall and leaning against it. Still higher, and outside the old town, is the fine new parish church of St Michael, consecrated in 1902.

The business quarter is on the rising ground north of the old town, near the railway station. Several fine modern buildings rise on or close to the shore in the town and to its south, whilst to the southwest is a convent of Capuchin nuns, who manage a large girls&#x27; school and several other educational establishments.

<text>Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc. (also known as Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures, commonly shortened to MGM) is an American film and television production and distribution company headquartered in Beverly Hills, California. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer was founded on April 17, 1924, and has been owned by the Amazon MGM Studios subsidiary of Amazon since 2022.

MGM was formed by Marcus Loew by combining Metro Pictures, Goldwyn Pictures and Louis B. Mayer Pictures into one company. It hired a number of well-known actors as contract players—its slogan was &quot;more stars than there are in heaven&quot;—and soon became Hollywood&#x27;s most prestigious filmmaking company, producing popular musical films and winning many Academy Awards. MGM also owned film studios, movie lots, movie theaters and technical production facilities. Its most prosperous era, from 1926 to 1959, was bracketed by two productions of &quot;Ben Hur&quot;. It divested itself of the Loews movie theater chain and, in 1956, expanded into television production.

In 1969, businessman and investor Kirk Kerkorian bought 40% of MGM and dramatically changed the operation and direction of the studio.&lt;ref name=&quot;mango-madness/MGM&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He hired new management, reduced the studio&#x27;s output to about five films per year, and diversified its products, creating MGM Resorts International as a Las Vegas–based hotel and casino company (which it later divested in the 1980s). In 1981, the studio acquired United Artists. In 1986, Kerkorian sold MGM to Ted Turner, who retained the rights to the MGM film library, sold the studio lot in Culver City to Lorimar, and sold the remnants of MGM back to Kerkorian a few months later. After Kerkorian sold and reacquired the company again in the 1990s, he expanded MGM by purchasing Orion Pictures and the Samuel Goldwyn Company, including both of their film libraries. Finally, in 2005, Kerkorian sold MGM to a consortium that included Sony Pictures.

In 2010, MGM filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and reorganization. After reorganization, it emerged from bankruptcy later that year under its creditors&#x27; ownership. Two former executives at Spyglass Entertainment, Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, became co-chairmen and co-CEOs of MGM&#x27;s new holding company. After Barber&#x27;s departure in 2018, the studio sought to be acquired by another company to pay its creditors. In May 2021, Amazon acquired MGM for ; the deal closed in March 2022. In October 2023, Amazon Studios absorbed MGM Holdings and rebranded itself as Amazon MGM Studios. As of 2023, its most commercially successful film franchises include &quot;Rocky&quot; and &quot;James Bond&quot;, while its most recent television productions include &quot;Fargo&quot; and &quot;The Handmaid&#x27;s Tale&quot;.

As a subsidiary of Amazon MGM Studios, MGM is a member of the Motion Picture Association (MPA); it was a founding member before leaving in the 2005 acquisition.
==Overview==
MGM was the last studio to convert to sound pictures—nonetheless, from the end of the silent film era through the late 1950s, it was the dominant motion picture studio in Hollywood. It was slow to respond to the changing legal, economic, and demographic nature of the motion picture industry during the 1950s and 1960s; and although its films often did well at the box office, it lost significant amounts of money throughout the 1960s. In 1966, MGM was sold to Canadian investor Edgar Bronfman Sr., whose son Edgar Jr. would later buy Universal Studios. Three years later, an increasingly unprofitable MGM was bought by Kirk Kerkorian, who slashed staff and production costs, forced the studio to produce low-quality, low-budget fare, and then ceased theatrical distribution in 1973. The studio continued to produce five to six films a year that were distributed through other studios, usually United Artists. Kerkorian did, however, commit to increased production and an expanded film library when he bought United Artists in 1981.

MGM ramped up internal production, and kept production going at UA, which was continuing to thrive, particularly with the lucrative James Bond film franchise. It also incurred significant amounts of debt to increase production. The studio took on additional debt as a series of owners took charge in the 1980s and early 1990s. In 1986, Ted Turner bought MGM, but a few months later, sold the company back to Kerkorian to recoup massive debt, while keeping the library assets for himself. The series of deals left MGM even more heavily in debt. MGM was bought by Pathé Communications (led by Italian publishing magnate Giancarlo Parretti) in 1990, but Parretti lost control of Pathé and defaulted on the loans used to purchase the studio. The French banking conglomerate Crédit Lyonnais, the studio&#x27;s major creditor, then took control of MGM. Even more deeply in debt, MGM was purchased by a joint venture between Kerkorian, producer Frank Mancuso, and Australia&#x27;s Seven Network in 1996.

The debt load from these and subsequent business deals negatively affected MGM&#x27;s ability to survive as an independent motion picture studio. After a bidding war which included Time Warner (the current parent of Turner Broadcasting) and General Electric (the owners of the NBC television network at the time), MGM was acquired on September 23, 2004, by a partnership consisting of Sony Corporation of America, Comcast, Texas Pacific Group (now TPG Capital, L.P.), Providence Equity Partners, and other investors.

After its bankruptcy in 2010, MGM reorganized, with its creditors&#x27; $4 billion debt transferred to ownership. MGM&#x27;s creditors controlled MGM through MGM Holdings, a private company. New management of its film and television production divisions was installed.

==History==
===Founding and early years===

In 1924, movie theater magnate Marcus Loew had a problem. He had bought Metro Pictures Corporation in 1919 for $3 million, to provide a steady supply of films for his large Loew&#x27;s Theatres chain. However, he found that his new property only provided a lackluster assortment of films. Seeking to solve this problem, Loew purchased Goldwyn Pictures in 1924 for $5 million to improve the quality of the theaters&#x27; products. However, these purchases created a need for someone to oversee his new Hollywood operations, since longtime assistant Nicholas Schenck was needed in New York headquarters to oversee the 150 theaters. A solution came in the person of Louis B. Mayer, head of Louis B. Mayer Pictures. Loew bought the Mayer studio for $75,000. Loews Incorporated completed the merger of the Loews theater chain and the three studios on April 17, 1924, celebrated with a fete on April 26, 1924. Mayer became head of the renamed Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, with 24-year-old Irving Thalberg as head of production. Final approval over budgets and contracts rested with New York City-based Loews Inc., while production decisions rested with the production headquarters in Culver City.

MGM produced more than 100 feature films in its first two years. In 1925, MGM released the extravagant and successful &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, taking a $4.7 million profit that year, its first full year. Also in 1925, MGM, Paramount Pictures and UFA formed a joint German distributor, Parufamet.

Marcus Loew died in 1927, and control of Loew&#x27;s passed to Nicholas Schenck. In 1929, William Fox of Fox Film Corporation bought the Loew family&#x27;s holdings with Schenck&#x27;s assent. Mayer and Thalberg disagreed with the decision. Mayer was active in the California Republican Party and used his political connections to persuade the Justice Department to delay final approval of the deal on antitrust grounds. During this time, in the summer of 1929, Fox was badly hurt in an automobile accident. By the time he recovered, the stock market crash in the fall of 1929 had nearly wiped Fox out and ended any chance of the Loew&#x27;s merger going through. Schenck and Mayer had never gotten along (Mayer reportedly referred to his boss as &quot;Mr. Skunk&quot;), and the abortive Fox merger increased the animosity between the two men.

===1920s and 1930s===
From the outset, MGM tapped into the audience&#x27;s need for glamor and sophistication. Having inherited few big names from their predecessor companies, Mayer and Thalberg began at once to create and publicize a host of new stars, among them Joan Crawford, Greta Garbo, John Gilbert, William Haines, and Norma Shearer (who followed Thalberg from Universal and eventually married him). Established names such as Wallace Beery, Lon Chaney, Buster Keaton, and William Powell were hired from other studios. They also hired top directors such as Clarence Brown, Tod Browning, Victor Seastrom, King Vidor and Erich von Stroheim. The arrival of talking pictures in 1928–29 gave opportunities to other new stars, many of whom would carry MGM through the 1930s: Clark Gable, Nelson Eddy, Jean Harlow, Myrna Loy, Jeanette MacDonald (often paired with Eddy), Robert Montgomery, Robert Taylor, and Spencer Tracy among them.

MGM was one of the first studios to experiment with filming in Technicolor. Using the two-color Technicolor process then available, MGM filmed portions of &quot;The Uninvited Guest&quot; (1924), &quot;The Big Parade&quot; (1925), and &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1925), among others, in the process. MGM released &quot;The Viking&quot; (1928), the first complete Technicolor feature with a synchronized score and sound effects, but no spoken dialogue.

With the arrival of &quot;talkies&quot;, MGM moved slowly and reluctantly into the sound era, releasing features such as &quot;White Shadows in the South Seas&quot; (1928) with music and sound effects, and &quot;Alias Jimmy Valentine&quot; (1928) with limited dialogue sequences. Their first full-fledged talkie, the musical &quot;The Broadway Melody&quot; (1929), however, was both a box-office success and won the Academy Award as Best Picture of the Year.

MGM was the last major studio to convert to sound. The studio&#x27;s first all-color, &quot;all-talking&quot; sound feature with dialogue was the musical &quot;The Rogue Song&quot; in 1930. MGM included a sequence made in Technicolor&#x27;s superior new three-color process, a musical number in the otherwise black-and-white &quot;The Cat and the Fiddle&quot; (1934), starring Jeanette MacDonald and Ramon Novarro. The studio then produced a number of three-color short subjects including the musical &quot;La Fiesta de Santa Barbara&quot; (1935); the first complete Technicolor feature was &quot;Sweethearts&quot; (1938) with MacDonald and Nelson Eddy, the earlier of the popular singing team&#x27;s two films in color. From then on, MGM regularly produced several films a year in Technicolor with &quot;Northwest Passage&quot; (1939) being one of the most notable of this era.
In addition to a large short-subjects program of its own, MGM also distributed the shorts and features produced by Hal Roach Studios, including comedy shorts starring Laurel and Hardy, Our Gang and Charley Chase. The studio&#x27;s distribution deal with Roach lasted from 1927 to 1938, and MGM benefited in particular from the success of the popular Laurel and Hardy films. In 1938, MGM purchased the rights to the Our Gang series from Roach and production of the successful series moved to the MGM studios, where it continued until 1944. From 1929 to 1931, MGM produced a series of comedy shorts called &quot;All Barkie Dogville Comedies&quot;, in which trained dogs were dressed up to parody contemporary films and were voiced by actors. One of the shorts, &quot;The Dogway Melody&quot; (1930), spoofed MGM&#x27;s hit 1929 musical &quot;The Broadway Melody&quot;.

MGM entered the music industry by purchasing the &quot;Big Three&quot; starting with Miller Music Publishing Co. in 1934, then Robbins Music Corporation. In 1935, MGM acquired a controlling interest in the capital stock of Leo Feist, Inc., the last of the Big Three. In the 1934 California gubernatorial election Democratic nominee Upton Sinclair ran against Republican incumbent Frank Merriam, the latter of whom MGM supported. MGM and other film studios deducted a day&#x27;s pay from each of their employees to raise an anti-Sinclair fund that amounted to $500,000. Irving Thalberg was to lead MGM&#x27;s anti-Sinclair campaign and the studio recruited Carey Wilson to create a series of anti-Sinclair propaganda films. These films, directed by Felix E. Feist, included fake newsreels of Sinclair supporters who were portrayed as bums and criminals. They were shown in California movie theaters, with one episode featuring hired actors as Sinclair supporters speaking with foreign accents.

During the 1930s, MGM produced approximately 50 pictures a year, though it never met its goal of releasing a new motion picture each and every week (it was only able to release one feature film every nine days). Loew&#x27;s 153 theaters were mostly located in New York, the Northeast, and Deep South; &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939) had its world premiere at Loew&#x27;s Grand Theatre in Atlanta, Georgia. A fine reputation was gained for lavish productions that were sophisticated and polished to cater to an urban audience. Still, as the Great Depression deepened, MGM began to economize by &quot;recycling&quot; existing sets, costumes, and furnishings from previous projects. This recycling practice never let up once started. In addition, MGM saved money because it was the only one of the big five studios that did not own an off-site movie ranch. Until the mid-1950s, MGM could make a claim its rivals could not: the studio never lost money, although it did produce an occasional disaster such as &quot;Parnell&quot; (1937), Clark Gable&#x27;s biggest flop. MGM was the only Hollywood studio that continued to pay dividends during the 1930s.
MGM stars dominated the box office during the 1930s, and the studio was credited for inventing the Hollywood stable-of-stars system as well. MGM contracted with the American Musical Academy of Arts Association to handle all of their press and artist development. The AMAAA&#x27;s main function was to develop the budding stars and to make them appealing to the public. Stars such as Joan Crawford, Greta Garbo, Myrna Loy, Jeanette MacDonald and Norma Shearer, reigned as the top-paid figures at the studio. Another MGM actress of the era, Jean Harlow, who had previously appeared in the Howard Hughes film &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angels&quot; (1930), now had a big break and became a Hollywood sex symbol and one of MGM&#x27;s most admired stars. Despite Harlow&#x27;s gain, Garbo arguably remained the biggest star at MGM. Shearer was still a money maker despite her screen appearances becoming scarce, and Crawford continued her box-office popularity until 1937. MGM also received a boost through the man who would become known as &quot;King of Hollywood&quot;, Clark Gable. Gable&#x27;s career took off to new heights after he won an Oscar for the Columbia film &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; (1934).

Mayer and Irving Thalberg&#x27;s association began warmly, but eventually relations between the two became strained; Thalberg preferred literary works and expensive costume pictures over the lower-budget, family-oriented crowd pleasers Mayer wanted. Thalberg, always physically frail, was removed as head of production in 1932. Mayer encouraged other staff producers, among them his son-in-law David O. Selznick, but no one seemed to have the sure touch of Thalberg. As Thalberg&#x27;s health deteriorated in 1936, Mayer could now serve as his temporary replacement. Rumors had begun circulating for some time that Thalberg was leaving MGM to set up his own independent company; his premature death at age 37 in September 1936 cost MGM dearly.

After Thalberg&#x27;s untimely death, Mayer became head of production, as well as studio chief, becoming the first million-dollar executive in American history. The company remained profitable, and an increase in MGM&#x27;s &quot;series&quot; pictures (&quot;Andy Hardy&quot; starring Mickey Rooney, &quot;Maisie&quot; starring Ann Sothern, &quot;The Thin Man&quot; starring William Powell and Myrna Loy, and &quot;Dr. Kildare/Dr. Gillespie&quot; with Lew Ayres and Lionel Barrymore) is cited as evidence of Mayer&#x27;s restored influence. Also playing a huge role was Ida Koverman, Mayer&#x27;s secretary and right hand.
In 1937, Mayer hired Mervyn LeRoy, a former Warner Bros. producer/director as MGM&#x27;s top producer and Thalberg&#x27;s replacement. LeRoy convinced Mayer to acquire the film rights to the popular children&#x27;s book &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;; MGM purchased the rights from Samuel Goldwyn for $75,000 in 1938.

MGM&#x27;s hits in 1939 included &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;; &quot;Ninotchka&quot;, starring Greta Garbo; &quot;The Women&quot;, starring Joan Crawford and Norma Shearer; and &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, starring Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O&#x27;Hara and Clark Gable as Rhett Butler. Although &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; was produced by Selznick International Pictures, the film was distributed by MGM as part of a deal for producer David O. Selznick, Mayer&#x27;s son-in-law, to obtain the services of Gable as well as financial assistance necessary for Selznick to complete the film. After Selznick International foundered in 1944, MGM acquired the full rights to &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot;. While &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; was a critical hit, the production costs for the film were so expensive it took 20 years before it turned a profit.

===1940s===
Within one year, beginning in 1942, Mayer released his five highest-paid actresses from their MGM contracts: Joan Crawford, Greta Garbo, Myrna Loy, Jeanette MacDonald and Norma Shearer. After being labeled &quot;box office poison&quot;, Crawford&#x27;s MGM contract was terminated and she moved to Warner Brothers, where her career took a dramatic upturn. Garbo and Shearer never made another film after leaving the lot. Of the five stars, Loy and MacDonald were the only two whom Mayer later rehired, in 1947 and 1948 respectively; Crawford returned to MGM after Mayer&#x27;s departure for the musical drama &quot;Torch Song&quot; in 1953.

Increasingly, before and during World War II, Mayer came to rely on his &quot;College of Cardinals&quot;—senior producers who controlled the studio&#x27;s output. This management-by-committee resulted in MGM losing its momentum, developing few new stars, and relying on the safety of sequels and bland material. (Dorothy Parker memorably referred to the studio as &quot;Metro-Goldwyn-Merde&quot;.) Production values remained high, and even &quot;B&quot; pictures carried a polish and gloss that made them expensive to mount. After 1940, production was cut from 50 pictures a year to a more manageable 25 features per year. During this period, MGM released several very successful musicals with stars such as Fred Astaire, Judy Garland, Gene Kelly, and Frank Sinatra.

===1950s===
Audiences began drifting to television in the late 1940s, and MGM and the other studios were finding it increasingly difficult to attract them to theaters. With its high overhead expenses, MGM&#x27;s profit margins continued to decrease. Word came from Nicholas Schenck in New York to find &quot;a new Thalberg&quot; who could improve quality while paring costs. Mayer thought he had found this savior in Dore Schary, a writer and producer who had found success at running RKO Pictures. Lavish musicals were Schary&#x27;s focus, and hits like &quot;Easter Parade&quot; (1948) and the popular films of Mario Lanza (including &quot;The Toast of New Orleans&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Great Caruso&quot; (1951)) helped keep MGM profitable.

In August 1951, Mayer was fired by MGM&#x27;s East Coast executives and he was replaced by Schary. Gradually cutting loose expensive contract players (including $6,000-a-week Judy Garland in 1950 and &quot;King of Hollywood&quot; Clark Gable in 1954), saving money by recycling existing movie sets instead of building costly new scenery, and reworking expensive old costumes, Schary managed to keep the studio running much as it had through the early 1940s, though his sensibilities for hard-edged, message movies would never bear much fruit. One bright spot was MGM musical pictures, under the aegis of producer Arthur Freed, who was operating what amounted to an independent unit within the studio. MGM produced some well-regarded and profitable musicals that would later be acknowledged as classics, among them &quot;An American in Paris&quot; (1951), &quot;Singin&#x27; in the Rain&quot; (1952), and &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot; (1954). However, &quot;Brigadoon&quot; (1954), &quot;Deep in My Heart&quot; (1954), &quot;It&#x27;s Always Fair Weather&quot; (1955), &quot;Invitation to the Dance&quot; (1956), and &quot;Les Girls&quot; (1957) were extravagant song and dance flops, and even the now-classic &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (1953) and &quot;Silk Stockings&quot; (1957) lost money upon their initial releases.

In 1952, as a settlement of the government&#x27;s restraint-of-trade action, &quot;United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.&quot; 334 US 131 (1948), Loews, Inc. gave up control of MGM. It would take another five years before the interlocking arrangements were completely undone, by which time both Loews and MGM were losing money. In 1956, Schary was ousted from MGM in another power struggle against the New York-based executives. Cost overruns and the failure of the big-budget epic &quot;Raintree County&quot; (1957) prompted the studio to terminate Schary&#x27;s contract.

Schary&#x27;s reign at MGM had been marked with few legitimate hits, but his departure (along with the retirement of Schenck in 1955) left a power vacuum that would prove difficult to fill. Initially Joseph Vogel became president and Sol Siegel head of production. In 1957 (by coincidence, the year Mayer died), the studio lost money for the first time in its 34-year history. After Spencer Tracy left MGM in 1955, the only major star remaining under contract from MGM&#x27;s heyday was Robert Taylor; by 1960, MGM had released Taylor and the last of its contract players, with many either retiring or moving on to television.

In 1958, MGM released what is generally considered its last great musical, Arthur Freed&#x27;s Cinemascope color production of &quot;Gigi&quot;, starring Leslie Caron, Maurice Chevalier, and Louis Jourdan. It was adapted from the novel by Colette, and written by the team of Lerner and Loewe, who also wrote &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; and &quot;Camelot&quot;. &quot;Gigi&quot; was a box-office and critical success which won nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture. From it came several hit songs, including &quot;Thank Heaven For Little Girls&quot;, &quot;I Remember It Well&quot;, the &quot;Waltz at Maxim&#x27;s&quot;, and the Oscar-winning title song. The film was the last MGM musical to win a Best Picture Oscar, an honor that had previously gone to &quot;The Broadway Melody&quot; (1929), &quot;The Great Ziegfeld&quot; (1936), and &quot;An American in Paris&quot; (1951). The last musical film produced by the &quot;Freed Unit&quot; was an adaptation of the Broadway musical &quot;Bells Are Ringing&quot; (1960) with Judy Holliday and Dean Martin. However, MGM did release later musical films, including an adaptation of Meredith Willson&#x27;s &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot; (1964) with Debbie Reynolds and Harve Presnell.

===MGM enters television===
MGM&#x27;s first television program, &quot;The MGM Parade&quot;, was produced by MGM&#x27;s trailer department as one of the compilation and promotional shows that imitated Disney&#x27;s series &quot;Disneyland&quot; which was also on ABC. &quot;Parade&quot; was canceled by ABC in the 2nd quarter of 1956. MGM took bids for its movie library in 1956 from Lou Chesler and others, but decided on entering the TV market itself. Chesler had offered $50 million for the film library. MGM Television was started with the hiring of Bud Barry to head up the operation in June 1956. MGM Television was to distribute its films to TV (starting with the networks), TV production and purchasing TV stations. TV production was expected to start with the 1957–58 season and was to include half-hour remakes of, or series based on, its pictures. Initial feature film sales focused on selling to the networks.

The year 1957 also marked the end of MGM&#x27;s animation department, as the studio determined it could generate the same amount of revenue by reissuing older cartoons as it could by producing and releasing new ones. William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, by then the heads of the MGM cartoon studio, took most of their unit and made their own company, Hanna-Barbera Productions, a successful producer of television animation.

In 1956, MGM sold the television rights for &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; to CBS, which scheduled it to be shown in November of that year. In a landmark event, the film became the first American theatrical fiction film to be shown complete in one evening on prime time television over a major American commercial network. (Laurence Olivier&#x27;s version of &quot;Hamlet&quot; was shown on prime time network TV a month later, but split in half over two weeks, and the 1950 film, &quot;The Titan: Story of Michelangelo&quot; was telecast by ABC in 1952, but that was a documentary.) Beginning in 1959, and lasting until 1991, telecasts of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; became an annual tradition, drawing huge audiences in homes all over the U.S. and earning additional profits for MGM. The studio was all too happy to see &quot;Oz&quot; become, through television, one of the two or three most famous films MGM has ever made, and one of the few films that nearly everybody in the U.S. has seen at least once. Today &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; is regularly shown on the Turner-owned channels, no longer just once a year.

===MGM cartoons===

In animation, MGM purchased the rights in 1930 to distribute a series of cartoons that starred a character named Flip the Frog, produced by Ub Iwerks. The first cartoon in this series (titled &quot;Fiddlesticks&quot;) was the first sound cartoon to be produced in two-color Technicolor. In 1933, Ub Iwerks canceled the unsuccessful Flip the Frog series and MGM began to distribute its second series of cartoons, starring a character named Willie Whopper, that was also produced by Iwerks.

In 1934, after Iwerks&#x27; distribution contract expired, MGM contracted with animation producers/directors Hugh Harman and Rudolph Ising to produce a new series of color cartoons. Harman and Ising came to MGM after breaking ties with Leon Schlesinger and Warner Bros. and brought with them their popular &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; character, Bosko. These were known as &quot;Happy Harmonies&quot;, and in many ways resembled the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;″ sister series, &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot;. The &quot;Happy Harmonies&quot; regularly ran over budget, and MGM dismissed Harman and Ising in 1937 to start its own animation studio.

After initial struggles with a poorly received series of &quot;The Captain and the Kids&quot; cartoons, the studio rehired Harman and Ising in 1939, and Ising created the studio&#x27;s first successful animated character, Barney Bear. However, MGM&#x27;s biggest cartoon stars would come in the form of the cat-and-mouse duo Tom and Jerry, created by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera in 1940. The &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons won seven Academy Awards between 1943 and 1953. In 1941, Tex Avery, another Schlesinger alumnus, joined the animation department. Avery gave the unit its image, with successes such as &quot;Red Hot Riding Hood&quot;, &quot;Swing Shift Cinderella&quot;, and the &quot;Droopy&quot; series.

Avery left the studio in 1953, leaving Hanna and Barbera to focus on the popular &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; and &quot;Droopy&quot; series. After 1955, all cartoons were filmed in CinemaScope until MGM closed its cartoon division in 1957.

In 1961, MGM resumed the release of new &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; shorts, and production moved to Rembrandt Films in Prague, Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic) under the supervision of Gene Deitch, who had been hired away from Terrytoons. Although Deitch&#x27;s &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoons were considered to be vastly inferior to the earlier Hanna and Barbera shorts, they did receive positive reviews in some quarters. In 1963, the production of &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; returned to Hollywood under Chuck Jones and his Sib Tower 12 Productions studio (later absorbed by MGM and renamed MGM Animation/Visual Arts). Jones&#x27; group also produced its own works, winning an Oscar for &quot;The Dot and the Line&quot; (1965), as well as producing the classic television version of Dr. Seuss&#x27;s &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas!&quot; (1966) featuring the voice of Boris Karloff. &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; folded in 1967, and the animation department continued with television specials and one feature film, &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot;. A revived Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Animation was in existence from 1993 to 1999.

===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.===
====MGM in the 1960s====
In 1959, MGM enjoyed what is quite probably its greatest financial success of later years, with the release of its nearly four-hour Technicolor epic &quot;Ben–Hur&quot;, a remake of its 1925 silent film hit, loosely based on a true storydespite being adapted from the novel by General Lew Wallace. Starring Charlton Heston in the title role, the film was critically acclaimed, and won 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, a record that held until &quot;Titanic&quot; matched it in 1997 and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; also did in 2003.

During this period, MGM fell into a questionable practice that eventually nearly doomed the studio: an entire year&#x27;s production schedule relied on the success of one big-budget epic film each year. This policy began in 1959, when &quot;Ben–Hur&quot; proved profitable enough to carry the studio through 1960. However, four succeeding big-budget epics—like &quot;Ben–Hur&quot;, each a remake—failed: &quot;Cimarron&quot; (1960), &quot;King of Kings&quot; (1961), &quot;Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse&quot; (1961), and, most notoriously, &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1962). The Cinerama film &quot;The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm&quot; (also 1962), the first film in Cinerama to actually tell a story, was also a financial failure. One other big-budget epic that was a success, however, was the MGM-Cinerama co-production &quot;How the West Was Won&quot; (1962), with a huge all-star cast. &quot;King of Kings&quot;, while a commercial and critical bomb at the time, has since come to be regarded as a film classic. The losses caused by these films led to the resignations of Sol Siegel and Joseph Vogel who were replaced by Robert M. Weitman (head of production) and Robert O&#x27;Brien (president).

The combination of O&#x27;Brien and Weitman seemed to temporarily revive the studio. MGM released David Lean&#x27;s immensely popular &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (1965), later followed by such hits as &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; (1967), &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) and &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; (1968). However the company&#x27;s time was taken up fighting off proxy attacks by corporate raiders, and then MGM backed another series of box office failures, including the musical remake of &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; (1969) and &quot;Ryan&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1970). Weitman moved over to Columbia in 1967 and O&#x27;Brien was forced to resign a few years later.

In the mid-1960s, MGM began to diversify by investing in real estate. Edgar Bronfman Sr. purchased a controlling interest in MGM in 1966 (and was briefly chairman of the board in 1969), and in 1967 Time Inc. became the company&#x27;s second-largest shareholder.

===Kirk Kerkorian investment===
In 1969, Kirk Kerkorian purchased 40 percent of MGM stock. What appealed to Kerkorian was MGM&#x27;s asset value, which included subsidiary businesses, real estate, and the value of 45 years&#x27; worth of glamour associated with the name, which he attached to a Las Vegas hotel and casino. As for film-making, that part of the company was bleeding money and was quickly and severely downsized under the supervision of James T. Aubrey Jr. With changes in its business model including fewer pictures per year, more location shooting and more distribution of independent productions, MGM&#x27;s operations were reduced. Aubrey sold off MGM&#x27;s accumulation of props, furnishings and historical memorabilia, including a pair of Dorothy&#x27;s ruby slippers from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Lot 3, of back-lot property, was sold off for real-estate development. In 1971, it was announced that MGM was in talks with 20th Century-Fox about a possible merger, a plan which never came into fruition. Under Aubrey, MGM also sold off MGM Records and its overseas theater holdings.

Through the 1970s, studio output slowed considerably as Aubrey preferred four or five medium-budget pictures each year along with a smattering of low-budget fare. In October 1973 and in decline in output, MGM closed its distribution offices then outsourced distribution for its films for a ten-year period to United Artists (UA). UA also purchased MGM&#x27;s music publishing arm, Robbins, Feist &amp; Miller plus half of Canadian record label Quality Records.

Kerkorian had largely distanced himself from the operations of the studio, focusing on the MGM Grand Hotel, investing $120 million into that project. Another portion of the backlot was sold in 1974. The last shooting done on the backlot was the introductory material for &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&quot; (1974), a retrospective documentary that became a surprise hit for the studio.

&quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment!&quot; was authorized by Dan Melnick, who was appointed head of production in 1972. Under Melnick&#x27;s regime, MGM produced a number of successful films in the 1970s, including &quot;Westworld&quot; (1973), &quot;Soylent Green&quot; (1973), &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; (1975), &quot;The Wind and the Lion&quot; (1975), &quot;Network&quot; (1976) and &quot;Coma&quot; (1978). Despite these successes, MGM never reclaimed its former status.

The MGM Recording Studios were sold in 1975. In 1979, Kerkorian issued a press statement that MGM was now primarily a hotel company. In 1980, MGM hit a symbolic low point when David Begelman, earlier fired by Columbia following the discovery of his acts of forgery and embezzlement, was installed as MGM&#x27;s president and CEO.

In 1980, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, Inc. split its production and casino units into separate companies: Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Film Co. and MGM Grand Hotels, Inc. The rise of ancillary markets was enough to allow MGM to increase production to 10-15 films a year compared to three to six in the previous decade, but first it needed to revive its distribution unit.

===MGM/UA Entertainment===

MGM proceeded to return to theatrical distribution in 1981 with its purchase of United Artists (UA), as UA&#x27;s parent company Transamerica Corporation decided to jettison the studio following the huge financial debacle of &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot; (1980); after this acquisition, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Film Co. was renamed &quot;MGM/UA Entertainment Company&quot;. MGM/UA formed a trio of subsidiaries, the MGM/UA Home Entertainment Group, MGM/UA Classics, and the MGM/UA Television Group in 1982. Kerkorian offered to purchase the remaining outstanding MGM shares he did not own to take the company private but was met with resistance. MGM/UA sold its music publishing division to CBS Songs in 1983 with a five-year co-publishing agreement.

After the purchase of UA, David Begelman&#x27;s duties were transferred to that unit. Under Begelman, MGM/UA produced a number of unsuccessful films, and he was fired in July 1982. Out of the 11 films he put into production, only one film, &quot;Poltergeist&quot; (1982), proved to be a clear hit during his tenure with the studio. &quot;WarGames&quot; (1983) and &quot;Octopussy&quot; (1983) were both hits for MGM/UA, but did not push MGM into the profit range that Kerkorian wanted.

Not even MGM&#x27;s greatest asset – its library – was enough to keep the studio afloat. After 1982, the studio relied more on distribution, picking up independent productions, rather than financing its own projects. The first of these deals was with Fred Silverman&#x27;s InterMedia. In 1982, the company entered into a relationship with mini-major studio and film distributor The Cannon Group, Inc. for theatrical and home video distribution; this would not be the last time Cannon and MGM would be involved with each other. Other producers and companies, such as Dino De Laurentiis and PSM Entertainment, also made deals with MGM/UA.

===MGM Entertainment===
On August 7, 1985, Turner Broadcasting System offered to buy MGM/UA. As film licensing to television became more complicated, Ted Turner saw the value of acquiring MGM&#x27;s film library for his Superstation WTBS. Ahead of the merger, MGM/UA Distribution Co. become the newly minted joint venture UA/MGM Distribution Co., which would handle sales and operations of MGM and UA feature films. On March 25 of the following year, the deal was finalized in a cash-stock deal for $1.5 billion, and the company was renamed &quot;MGM Entertainment Co.&quot;. Turner immediately sold MGM&#x27;s United Artists subsidiary back to Kerkorian for roughly $480 million. However, Turner was unable to find financing for the rest of the deal because of concerns in the financial community over the debt-load of his companies; thus, on August 26, 1986, Turner was forced to sell MGM&#x27;s production and distribution assets to UA for $300 million. The MGM studio lot and lab facilities were sold to Lorimar-Telepictures. Lorimar-Telepictures would later sell the Metrocolor facilities, Metrocolor Film Laboratory (aka MGM Laboratory) to Technicolor for $60 million. Turner retained the pre-May 1986 library of MGM films, along with the RKO Radio Pictures and pre-1950 Warner Bros. films which UA had previously purchased.

How much of MGM&#x27;s back catalog Turner actually obtained was a point of conflict for a time; eventually, it was determined that Turner owned all of the pre-May 1986 MGM library, as well as the pre-1950 Warner Bros. catalog, the &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons released by Paramount (both the pre-1950 Warner Bros. library and &quot;Popeye&quot; cartoons were sold to Associated Artists Productions, which was later bought by UA), and the US/Canadian rights to the RKO library, in addition to MGM&#x27;s television series. Turner used the acquired films to launch the new cable channel Turner Network Television.

===MGM/UA Communications===

After Kerkorian reclaimed MGM in August 1986, the MGM/UA name continued to be used, but the company changed its name, this time to MGM/UA Communications Co., which was renamed from United Artists Corporation, now using MGM and UA as separate brands. The change became official on September 10, 1986, and at that time, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) ticker symbol was changed from UA, yet again, to MGM. In 1987, MGM/UA Communications Co., Paramount Pictures and Universal Pictures teamed up in order to market feature film and television product to China.

Kerkorian, however, continued to try to sell portions of MGM/UA. In July 1988, Kerkorian announced plans to split MGM and UA into separate studios. Under this deal, Kerkorian, who owned 82% of MGM/UA Communications, would have sold 25% of MGM to Barris Industries (controlled by producers Burt Sugarman, Jon Peters, and Peter Guber). The proposition to spin off MGM was called off a few weeks later. In 1989, two Australian-based media entities attempted to gain control of MGM/UA. The first was Rupert Murdoch&#x27;s News Corporation, which had purchased 20th Century Fox in 1985, making a $1.35 billion bid; rival Australian media company Qintex attempted to buy MGM from Kerkorian—topping Murdoch&#x27;s bid with a $1.5 billion offer—but the deal collapsed as Qintex was plagued by financial issues. Ted Turner also attempted to buy MGM/UA again, but these efforts also failed.

===MGM-Pathé Communications===

In 1990, Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti announced he was about to buy MGM/UA. Although the French government had scuttled Parretti&#x27;s bid to buy Pathé due to concerns about his character, background, and past dealings, Parretti gained backing from Crédit Lyonnais and bought MGM/UA from Kirk Kerkorian. To finance the purchase, Parretti licensed the MGM/UA library to Time Warner for home video and Turner for domestic television rights until 2003. He then merged it with his Pathé Communications Corporation (formerly The Cannon Group, a distributor that Parretti had renamed before his aborted bid for Pathé; ironically, MGM had previously distributed Cannon product several years prior) to form MGM–Pathe Communications Co.

The well-respected executive, Alan Ladd Jr., a former president of MGM/UA, was brought on board as CEO of MGM in 1991. However, a year later, Parretti&#x27;s ownership of MGM–Pathé dissolved in a flurry of lawsuits and a default by Crédit Lyonnais, and Parretti faced securities-fraud charges in the United States and Europe. It was later revealed that Parretti&#x27;s deal to buy MGM/UA was largely based on fraudulent and/or highly leveraged loans; upon taking over MGM, he had fired almost all of the financial staff, resulting in chaos at MGM amid complaints from actors, directors and others who were not being paid. Danjaq, LLC also began litigation against MGM during this time after Parretti attempted to sell the international TV rights to the &quot;James Bond&quot; franchise without their knowledge or approval, as a method of financing his buyout of MGM; this in turn caused the planned production of the seventeenth &quot;Bond&quot; film, &quot;Property of a Lady&quot;, to grind to a halt (the length of the lawsuit ultimately led to Timothy Dalton&#x27;s departure from the role and Pierce Brosnan taking over for the seventeenth installment, 1995&#x27;s &quot;GoldenEye&quot;).

On the verge of bankruptcy, Crédit Lyonnais took full control of MGM–Pathé via loan default in mid-1992 and reverted its name back to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The bank fired Ladd and replaced him with former Paramount executive Frank Mancuso Sr. Mancuso then hired Michael Marcus as chairman, MGM Pictures and former Warner Bros. executive John Calley as United Artists head. A television production division was started up. As part of his exit package, Ladd took some of the top properties, including &quot;Braveheart&quot;.

On December 21, 1992, MGM&#x27;s 15% investment ($30 million in cash) in Carolco Pictures plus a $30 million convertible note was approved by Carolco&#x27;s board. MGM also started distributing Carolco&#x27;s films in January 1994 after its deal with TriStar Pictures ended. While MGM had to convince parent Credit Lyonnais to allow the deal, Lyonnais was Carolco&#x27;s main lender thus allowing the bank to collect outstanding debts and extend a new line of credit.

MGM Holdings, Inc. was formed to take on about $1 billion in MGM&#x27;s liabilities off MGM&#x27;s balance sheet in the third quarter of 1993. Credit Lyonnais extended a $400 million line of credit allowing a Chemical Bank lead bank group to extend a $350 million line of credit in 1994. In 1994, MGM had a hit in &quot;Stargate&quot;. Deals made during this era included one with Sega of America to create TV shows and films based on Sega&#x27;s video games (including an ultimately-unmade film based on &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;, titled &quot;Sonic: Wonders of the World&quot;) and another deal with Rysher Entertainment.

===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Pictures===
Crédit Lyonnais soon put MGM up for sale. Bidders included News Corporation, The Walt Disney Company and General Electric (GE); independent production firms New Regency and Morgan Creek Productions; and several foreign firms, including France&#x27;s Chargeurs, Germany&#x27;s Bertelsmann and the British/Dutch media company PolyGram. Ultimately the highest bidder was none other than Kirk Kerkorian, who re-purchased the studio in October 1996 for $1.3 billion, becoming MGM&#x27;s owner for the third time; others involved in the deal included MGM studio head Mancuso and Australian television station Seven Network (which Kerkorian would later purchase himself in 1998). John Calley left as head of United Artists to become head of Sony Pictures Entertainment around this time, allegedly because of Mancuso not keeping him informed of the planned buyout and his low salary.

1997 proved to be an eventful year for MGM. On April 11, 1997, MGM bought Metromedia&#x27;s film subsidiaries (Orion Pictures, The Samuel Goldwyn Company, and the Motion Picture Corporation of America) for US$573 million, substantially enlarging its library of films and television series and acquiring additional production capacity. The deal closed in July of that year. This catalog, along with the James Bond franchise, was considered to be MGM&#x27;s primary asset. MGM&#x27;s long-running cable television series, &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, premiered on Showtime on July 27. MGM and Danjaq, LLC filed a lawsuit against Sony Pictures in November, as Sony was intending to launch a rival Bond franchise backed by Kevin McClory; the lawsuit alleged that Calley had used confidential information from his tenure at MGM/UA to assist Sony with their attempt at making a &quot;James Bond&quot; film. MGM acquired the rights to the unofficial Bond production &quot;Never Say Never Again&quot; from Jack Schwartzman&#x27;s estate that December.

In December 1997, MGM attempted to purchase 1,000 films (referred to as the Epic film library) held by Consortium de Réalisation, but was outbid by PolyGram. However, they ultimately succeeded when they acquired of the pre-1996 PolyGram Filmed Entertainment library from Seagram in 1999 for $250 million, increasing their library holdings to 4,000. Prior to that, MGM had held a home video license for 100 of the films since spring 1997. The PolyGram libraries were purchased by its Orion Pictures subsidiary so as to avoid its 1990 video distribution agreement with Warner Home Video. The studio also obtained the broadcast rights to more than 800 of its films previously licensed to Turner Broadcasting System.

By 1998, MGM had started a specialty film unit using The Samuel Goldwyn Company under the Goldwyn Films name. Samuel Goldwyn Jr. sued Metromedia over salary and damages when he worked at Goldwyn Company under Metromedia and sued MGM over the use of the Goldwyn name claiming trademark infringement and unfair competition. MGM and Metromedia settled on January 10, 1999, with MGM&#x27;s Goldwyn Films changing its name to G2 Films. In the middle of that year, MGM and Sony settled in an out-of-court lawsuit that saw MGM trading its &quot;Spider-Man&quot; film rights (itself obtained by MGM through a messy legal process involving Cannon and Carolco) to Sony in exchange for gaining the rights to &quot;Casino Royale&quot;.

In March 1999, MGM announced that it had paid $225 million to end its home video distribution contract with Warner Home Video and re-acquired the home video rights to their post-1986 catalog while Warner took over home video distribution of the pre-1986 catalogue. MGM also ended its international theatrical distribution agreement with United International Pictures (UIP) after UIP was accused by the European Union (EU) of being an illegal cartel. On June 22, 1999, MGM announced they had formed a three-year international distribution agreement and strategic alliance with 20th Century Fox for theatrical and home video releases outside North America, alongside a deal to jointly explore cable and satellite distribution ventures worldwide. The Fox deal would begin in February 2000 for home video releases and November 2000 for theatrical releases, and last until the end of January 2003.

MGM purchased 20 percent of Rainbow Media Group from Cablevision Systems for $825 million in 2001. MGM attempted to take over Universal Studios in 2003, but failed, and was forced to sell several of its cable channel investments (taking a $75-million loss on the deal).

In January 2002, MGM formed the MGM Entertainment Business Group with lawyer Darcie Denkert as president. This placed her in charge of MGM on Stage, the company&#x27;s theatrical arm. Her friend Dean Stolber joined her as co-president of the theatrical unit.

On May 27, 2003, MGM re-acquired full home video distribution rights to its films internationally, while Fox would continue to distribute on behalf of MGM in select developing regions.

====Bidding war and corporate reorganization====
In 2002, Kerkorian again put MGM up for sale, with a suggested sale price of $7 billion. In 2004, many of MGM&#x27;s competitors started to make bids to purchase MGM, beginning with Time Warner. Time Warner&#x27;s bid was expected, since the company&#x27;s largest shareholder was Ted Turner, whose Turner Broadcasting System had merged with Time Warner in 1996. After a short period of negotiations with MGM, Time Warner was unsuccessful. The leading bidder proved to be Sony Corporation of America, backed by Comcast and private equity firms Texas Pacific Group (now TPG Capital, L.P.), DLJ and Providence Equity Partners. Sony&#x27;s primary goal was to ensure Blu-ray Disc support at MGM; cost synergies with Sony Pictures Entertainment were secondary. Time Warner made a counter-bid (which Ted Turner reportedly tried to block), but on September 13, 2004, Sony increased its bid of US$11.25 per share (roughly $4.7 billion) to $12 per share ($5 billion), and Time Warner subsequently withdrew its bid of $11 per share ($4.5 billion). MGM and Sony agreed on a purchase price of nearly $5 billion, of which about $2 billion was to pay off MGM&#x27;s debt. From 2005 to 2006, the Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group domestically distributed films by MGM and UA.

However, problems quickly arose between MGM and Sony. The largest issue was Sony failing to meet sales projections for MGM&#x27;s catalog on DVD; when this occurred, Providence Equity brought in Harry Sloan as chairman of MGM. Sloan began to champion MGM&#x27;s future as being independent of Sony as opposed to a label under Sony control; other issues both between MGM and Sony as well as inside both companies began to manifest, resulting in MGM reestablishing itself as an independent studio.

In February 2006, MGM announced it would return as a theatrical distribution company. MGM struck deals with The Weinstein Company (TWC), Lakeshore Entertainment, Bauer Martinez, and many other independent studios, and then announced its plans to release 14 feature films for 2006 and early 2007. MGM also hoped to increase the amount to over 20 by 2007. &quot;Lucky Number Slevin&quot;, released April 7, was the first film released under the new MGM era. The TWC distribution agreement covered three years, but ended three months early.

On May 31, 2006, MGM announced it would transfer the majority of its home video output from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment to 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. MGM also announced plans to restructure its worldwide television distribution operation. In addition, MGM signed a deal with New Line Television in which MGM would handle New Line&#x27;s U.S. film and series television syndication packages. MGM served as New Line&#x27;s barter sales representative in the television arena until 2008.

A tentative agreement was signed in Seoul on March 15, 2006, between MGM, South Korea-based entertainment agency Glovit and Busan city officials for a theme park scheduled to open in 2011. MGM Studio City was projected to cost $1.02 billion, built on 245 acres owned by the city in a planned tourist district and contain 27 attractions, a film academy with movie sets, hotels, restaurants and shopping facilities. Glovit was expected to find funding and oversee management of the park, while MGM received a licensing agreement making them handle content and overall planning and the option to buy a 5%–10% share.

On November 2, 2006, producer/actor Tom Cruise and his production partner, Paula Wagner, signed an agreement with MGM to run United Artists. Wagner served as United Artists&#x27; chief executive.

====MGM in the digital age====
Over the next several years, MGM launched a number of initiatives in distribution and the use of new technology and media, as well as joint ventures to promote and sell its products. In April 2007, it was announced that MGM movies would be able to be downloaded through Apple&#x27;s iTunes service, with MGM bringing an estimated 100 of its existing movies to iTunes service, the California-based computer company revealed. The list of movies included the likes of modern features such as &quot;Rocky&quot;, &quot;Ronin&quot;, &quot;Mad Max&quot;, and &quot;Dances with Wolves&quot;, along with more golden-era classics such as &quot;Lilies of the Field&quot; and &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;. In October, the company launched MGM HD on DirecTV, offering a library of movies formatted in Hi Def. MGM teamed up with Weigel Broadcasting to launch a new channel titled This TV on November 1, 2008. On August 12, 2008, MGM teamed up with Comcast to launch a new video-on-demand network titled Impact. On November 10, 2008, MGM announced that it would release full-length films on YouTube.

On April 14, 2008, a South Korea government agency announced that MGM and Incheon International Airport Corporation agreed to build MGM Studio Theme Park. The selected site was a 1.5 million square meter Yeongjongdo island property near the Incheon International Airport. Ultimately, the park was designed but never built.

====MGM files for bankruptcy====
As of mid-2009, MGM had US$3.7 billion in debt, and interest payments alone totaled $250 million a year. MGM was earning approximately $500 million a year on income from its extensive film and television library, but the economic recession is reported to have reduced this income substantially.

Whether MGM could avoid voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy had been a topic of much discussion in the film industry. MGM had to repay a $250-million line of credit in April 2010, a $1-billion loan in June 2011, and its remaining US$2.7 billion in loans in 2012. In May 2009, MGM&#x27;s auditor gave the company a clean bill of health, concluding it was still on track to meet its debt obligations. At that time, the company was negotiating with its creditors to either extend the debt repayment deadlines or engage in a debt-for-equity swap. Industry observers, however, questioned whether MGM could avoid a Chapter-11 bankruptcy filing under any circumstances, and concluded that any failure to conclude the negotiations must trigger a filing. MGM and its United Artists subsidiary were now producing very few films each year, and it was widely believed that MGM&#x27;s solvency would depend on the box-office performance of these films (especially &quot;Skyfall&quot;). There was some indication that Relativity Media and its financial backer, Elliott Associates (a hedge fund based in New York), had been acquiring MGM debt in an attempt to force the company into involuntary bankruptcy.

On August 17, 2009, chief executive officer Harry E. Sloan stepped down and MGM hired Stephen F. Cooper as its new CEO, a corporate executive who guided Enron through its post-2001 bankruptcy and oversaw the restructuring and growth of Krispy Kreme in 2005. Expectations were that Cooper was hired to act quickly on MGM&#x27;s debt problems. On October 1, 2009, the studio&#x27;s new leadership negotiated a forbearance agreement with its creditors under which interest payments due from September to November 2009 did not have to be paid until December 15, 2009.

MGM stated in February 2010 that the studio would likely be sold in the next four months, and that its latest film, &quot;Hot Tub Time Machine&quot;, might be one of the last four films to bear the MGM name. However, some stated that the company might continue as a label for new James Bond productions, as well as other movie properties culled from the MGM library.

MGM Holdings, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and 160 affiliates filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on November 3, 2010, with a prepackaged plan for exiting bankruptcy which led to MGM&#x27;s creditors taking over the company. On December 20, 2010, MGM executives announced that the studio had emerged from bankruptcy. Spyglass Entertainment executives Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum became co-Chairs and co-CEOs of the studio.

====Post-bankruptcy era====
On January 4, 2011, MGM and Weigel Broadcasting announced plans to distribute MeTV nationwide. On February 2, 2011, MGM named Jonathan Glickman to be the film president of MGM. Six days later, MGM was finalizing a distribution deal with Sony Pictures Entertainment to handle distribution of its films worldwide, including the two upcoming Bond films &quot;Skyfall&quot; and &quot;Spectre&quot;, and MGM having the right to be co-financier on selected Sony films, such as &quot;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&quot;. The deal was finalized on April 13, 2011. 20th Century Fox&#x27;s deal with MGM handling its library distribution worldwide was set to expire in September 2011. However, the deal was renewed and extended on April 14, 2011 and, after five years, was renewed and extended again on June 27, 2016. It was expired in until June 2020 due to Disney&#x27;s acquisition of 21st Century Fox&#x27;s properties (including 20th Century Fox) in 2019.

MGM moved forward with several upcoming projects, including remakes of &quot;RoboCop&quot; and &quot;Poltergeist&quot; (the &quot;RoboCop&quot; and &quot;Poltergeist&quot; remakes were released in 2014 and 2015, respectively), and released their first post-bankruptcy film, &quot;Zookeeper&quot;, which was co-distributed by Columbia Pictures on July 8, 2011. The new MGM, under Barber and Birnbaum&#x27;s control, focuses on co-investing on films made by another party, which handle all distribution and marketing for the projects. MGM handles international television distribution rights for the new films as well as its library of existing titles and also retains its in-house production service. In separate 2011 deals, the rights to MGM&#x27;s completed films &quot;Red Dawn&quot; and &quot;The Cabin in the Woods&quot; were dealt to FilmDistrict as well as Lionsgate Films, respectively.

On October 3, 2012, Birnbaum announced his intention to exit his role as an MGM executive and return to &quot;hands-on&quot; producing. He will remain with the studio to produce films on &quot;an exclusive basis&quot;. In December 2012, Denkert retired as co-president of MGM on Stage after producing five Broadway and West End plays. In May 2014, MGM introduced The Works, a channel available in 31 percent of the country, including stations owned by Titan Broadcast Management.

In 2013, the Orion brand was revived as a television production label for a syndicated court show. The Orion Pictures name was extended in fourth quarter 2014 for smaller domestic and international video on demand and limited theatrical releases.

In March 2017, MGM announced a multi-year distribution deal with Annapurna Pictures for some international markets and including home entertainment, theatrical and television rights. Later on October 31, 2017, the two companies formed a US distribution joint venture called Mirror Releasing. However, this partnership will not be exclusive to all MGM films, as several of them will continue to be released through existing studio partners, such as Warner Bros. and Paramount. It also does not include newly relaunched Orion Pictures. On February 5, 2019, Annapurna and MGM rebranded and expanded their US distribution joint venture as United Artists Releasing, marking another revival of the United Artists brand, with the Orion Pictures distribution team and films joining the venture. The decision was made to coincide with the United Artists brand&#x27;s 100th anniversary.

Following the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations in October 2017, MGM was listed as one of 22 potential buyers interested in acquiring The Weinstein Company. In October 2017, MGM&#x27;s board renewed Gary Barber&#x27;s contract as chairman and CEO until December 2022. In February 2018, Chris Brearton, the former media M&amp;A attorney of Latham and Watkins, was appointed as chief operating officer. On March 19, 2018, MGM Holdings announced that Barber had been fired by the studio&#x27;s board of directors. MGM gave no reason for his firing. For the interim, the company would be led by the newly formed &quot;Office of the CEO&quot;.

In April 2019, MGM signed a two-year, first-look deal for films with Smokehouse Pictures, owned by George Clooney and Grant Heslov. The deal&#x27;s first film is a yet-to-be-named John DeLorean film based on journalist Alex Pappademas&#x27; &quot;Epic&quot; magazine article &quot;Saint John&quot;, written by Keith Bunin and Clooney as director with a possibility of starring.

In April 2019, MGM made a multi-film non-exclusive creative partnership with AGBO Films to co-develop, co-produce and co-finance a slate from the MGM library. The deal includes a new film projects joint development fund with the first film under the deal to be a remake of &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot;.

MGM agreed to a $100 million co-financing slate deal with Bron Creative in June 2019. The slate consisted of at least nine films including three Orion Pictures films.

MGM was one of the first studios to delay the films, including &quot;No Time to Die&quot;, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was followed by an April 2020 layoff of 7% of employees.

A shuffle of top executives occurred in the first four months. Glickman left in January 2020 and replaced by Michael De Luca as chairman of the motion picture group. A motion picture group president, veteran executive and producer Pamela Abdy, was named in early April. Co-presidents of production Cassidy Lange, Adam Rosenberg left by May 1, 2020.

In May 2020, MGM made an investment, facilitated by its television group, in Audio Up podcast production studio, platform and network. Audio Up would also produce 5 podcasts per year for MGM and agreed to an exclusive first look for its works. Later that month, MGM agreed to a two-year film and television first-look development deal with Killer Films.

In 2013 and 2015, Starz Entertainment signed exclusive film licensing agreements with MGM for 585 movies and 176 television series. In August 2019, Starz found an MGM-owned film, &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventure&quot;, covered by the agreement to be streaming on Amazon Prime Video, and had it pulled. Starz pressed them and MGM admitted in November that 244 films and television series were being shown on other platforms including Epix. MGM indicated that month that the license tracking system was fixed; Starz instead found an additional 100 MGM films on other platforms. With this seeming to diminish their channel&#x27;s value to cable operators, Starz sued on May 4, 2020, to uncover all contract violations.

===Amazon subsidiary===

In December 2020, MGM began to explore a potential sale of the studio, with the COVID-19 pandemic and the domination of streaming platforms due to the closure of movie theaters as contributing factors. The company hired Morgan Stanley and LionTree Advisors to handle the process on behalf of the studio. On May 17, 2021, online retail and technology company Amazon entered negotiations to acquire the studio. The negotiations were made directly with MGM board chairman Kevin Ulrich whose Anchorage Capital Group is a major shareholder. On May 26, 2021, it was officially announced that MGM would be acquired by Amazon for $8.45 billion, subject to regulatory approvals and other routine closing conditions; with the studio continuing to operate as a label under Amazon&#x27;s existing content arm, complementing Amazon Studios and Amazon Prime Video. On March 15, 2022, Amazon secured an unconditional European Union (EU) antitrust approval for its proposed acquisition of MGM.

On February 8, 2022, Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Licorice Pizza&quot; became the studio&#x27;s first fully produced, marketed and distributed film to be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture in 33 years, after 1988&#x27;s &quot;Rain Man&quot;. On March 17, Amazon finalized the merger. Later that day, Amazon Studios and Prime Video SVP Mike Hopkins revealed that Amazon will continue to partner with United Artists Releasing, which will remain in operation to release all future MGM titles theatrically on a &quot;case-by-case basis,&quot; while &quot;all MGM employees will join my organization.&quot; It was also revealed that Amazon had no plans to make changes to the studio&#x27;s production slate and release schedules nor make all MGM content exclusive to Prime Video, providing some hope that the studio would operate autonomously from Amazon Studios. These plans are expected to not impact the future of the James Bond franchise and its creative team. Two town halls further detailing MGM&#x27;s future post-merger took place on March 18, which included one for MGM employees and one for Amazon Studios/Prime Video employees. Both revealed the new interim reporting structure as part of Amazon&#x27;s &quot;phased integration plan&quot;, which would involve De Luca, Mark Burnett (Chairman of MGM Worldwide Television) and COO Chris Brearton reporting to Hopkins on behalf of the studio. On March 22, the studio made its first post-merger acquisition with Luca Guadagnino&#x27;s &quot;Bones and All&quot;, for which the studio purchased the global distribution rights. On April 27, 2022, it was announced that De Luca and Abdy would leave the studio for Warner Bros. A few months later, in August, it was announced MGM and Warner Bros. had signed a multi-year pact to distribute MGM&#x27;s titles internationally outside North America, both theatrically in international territories and on home video worldwide, beginning with &quot;Bones and All&quot; and &quot;Creed III&quot;. The deal however excludes the films &quot;Till&quot;, &quot;Women Talking&quot;, and the 26th Eon-produced James Bond film, which would be distributed by Universal Pictures, with whom MGM had an international distribution deal earlier. On November 30, 2022, it was announced that Jennifer Salke, head of Amazon Studios, will be given full control of MGM&#x27;s film and television divisions, with Brearton stepping down as COO to become the Vice President of PVS Corporate Strategy for MGM+ and MGM Alternative Television. On March 4, 2023, it was revealed that Amazon had shut down United Artists Releasing&#x27;s operations and folded it into MGM, amid the decision to release Amazon Studios&#x27; &quot;Air&quot; into theaters instead of Prime Video amidst 2024 Oscar buzz. This made &quot;Creed III&quot; the first film released and distributed by MGM itself under the new parent company instead of UAR. On March 22, 2023, longtime MGM distribution head Erik Lomis died.

In May 2023, Amazon Studios created Amazon MGM Studios Distribution, an international film and television distribution unit for 
both MGM and Amazon projects. The first MGM films from the new distributor were &quot;Saltburn&quot;, which premiered at the Telluride Film Festival on August 30, 2023, and &quot;Sitting in Bars with Cake&quot;, which was released on Prime Video on September 8, 2023. On October 4, 2023, Pablo Iacoviello, Amazon&#x27;s director of monetization for local originals, announced at the TV forum Iberseries &amp; Platino Industria in Madrid that Amazon Studios would be renamed to Amazon MGM Studios itself to reflect this. On September 17, 2023, Orion Pictures&#x27; &quot;American Fiction&quot; earned the studio its first win for the People&#x27;s Choice Award at that year&#x27;s Toronto International Film Festival. In January 2024, Amazon announced hundreds of layoffs across Amazon MGM Studios, Prime Video and Twitch in order to &quot;prioritize our investments for the long-term success of our business, while relentlessly focusing on what we know matters most to our customers,&quot; according to Mike Hopkins.

In March 2024, beginning with the Prime Video release of the remake of &quot;Road House&quot;, the studio kicked off the centennial anniversary celebration of its founding, with a &quot;100 Years&quot; logo variant appearing on titles produced by MGM throughout the year. In April 2024, the studio, in collaboration with Fandango at Home, Rotten Tomatoes and iTunes, offered customers a &quot;100 Essential Movies&quot; bundle of 100 films from its library as part of their centennial for a limited time. In September 2024, Amazon MGM Studios and Prime Video became the seventh member of the MPA, marking MGM&#x27;s return to membership since 2005.

==Headquarters==
Since August 22, 2011, MGM&#x27;s headquarters have been in Beverly Hills, California, where it rents space in a six-story office building. The facility was originally built for the William Morris talent agency, but had remained all but unoccupied because of the agency&#x27;s merger with Endeavor Talent Agency in April 2009. MGM planned to house a private theater and a private outdoor patio in the building.


Prior to 2003, MGM&#x27;s headquarters were in the Colorado Center in Santa Monica, California, occupying at least . In 2000, it announced it was moving its headquarters to a new building in Century City that was to be the first high-rise in Los Angeles to be completed in the 21st century. When the company agreed to be its lead tenant halfway through the building&#x27;s design process, it became identified as MGM Tower, planned for a 2003 opening. When MGM moved into the lavishly appointed spaces devised by Alex Yemenidjian, former MGM chairperson and chief executive, Roger Vincent and Claudia Eller observed in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that &quot;Yemenidjian spared no expense in building out the studio&#x27;s space with such Las Vegas-style flourishes as towering marble pillars and a grand spiral staircase lined with a wall of awards.&quot;

Architect Scott Johnson designed the bottom third of the tower with extra-large floors so MGM executives could have outdoor decks. No expense seemed to be spared—from imported Italian marble for MGM&#x27;s offices, to the company&#x27;s exclusive use of a private garage, security checkpoint, and elevator bank, all to enable visiting celebrities discreet entry and exit. One of the tower&#x27;s three screening rooms was a 100-seat theater on the ground floor (later taken over by International Creative Management in December 2010). The 14th-floor lobby housed the executive suites and a wall of Oscar statuettes for Academy Award-winning films. The street leading to the building&#x27;s garage was renamed MGM Drive and a large MGM logo, illuminated at night, crowned the building. As of December 2010, MGM was renting in MGM Tower at a cost of almost $5 per square foot per month.

Emerging from bankruptcy protection in 2010, MGM announced that it planned to move its headquarters to Beverly Hills as part of an effort to resolve almost $5 billion in debt, since the lease in Century City was not scheduled to expire until 2018. Vincent and Eller said that MGM&#x27;s per-square-foot monthly rent would be far lower in the Beverly Hills building than in MGM Tower. Larry Kozmont, a real estate consultant not involved in the process, said, &quot;It&#x27;s a prudent move for them. Downsizing and relocating to a space that is still prominent but not overly ostentatious and burdened by expenses is fundamental for their survival.&quot; MGM vacated its namesake tower on August 19, 2011.

==Leo logo and mottos==

The studio&#x27;s official motto, &quot;Ars Gratia Artis&quot;, is a Latin phrase meaning &quot;Art for art&#x27;s sake&quot;. It was chosen by Howard Dietz, the studio&#x27;s chief publicist. The studio&#x27;s logo is a roaring lion surrounded by a ring of film inscribed with the studio&#x27;s motto. The logo, which features Leo the Lion, was created by Dietz in 1916 for Goldwyn Pictures and updated in 1924 for MGM&#x27;s use. Dietz based the logo on his alma mater&#x27;s mascot, the Columbia University lion. Originally silent, the sound of Leo the Lion&#x27;s roar was added to films for the first time in August 1928.

In the 1930s and 1940s, the studio billed itself as having &quot;more stars than there are in heaven&quot;, a reference to the large number of A-list movie stars under its contract. This second motto was also coined by Dietz and was first used in 1932.

On March 8, 2021, the studio unveiled a rebrand, centered on the &quot;Ars Gratia Artis&quot; motto, across its social media and marketing platforms, including a photorealistic CGI version of its Leo the Lion emblem and logo, also introducing a new print logo for television, digital, and film posters, phasing out the static MGM logo in favor of simply the company&#x27;s initials, done in the company&#x27;s longtime typeface. This was to make the studio&#x27;s name more recognizable when viewed at a small size.

As of September 2023, this version of the logo is also being used to represent Amazon MGM Studios at the start of films produced and/or distributed by the parent company without MGM&#x27;s involvement after retiring their own 20162023 on-screen logo as a result of their rebrand.

==Film library==
===Turner Entertainment Co.===
Following his brief ownership of the company in 1986, Ted Turner formed Turner Entertainment Co. as a holding company for the pre-May 1986 MGM film and television library and pre-1950 Warner Bros. film library which he retained. For several years after the sale, MGM continued to distribute home video releases of those films under license from Turner, though in 1990 it sold all of its home video distribution rights to Warner Bros. After Turner&#x27;s holdings were purchased by Time Warner Entertainment in 1996, the rights for the Turner-owned films were reassigned to Warner Home Video in 1999 when MGM ended their distribution deal with Warner Home Video, though Turner Entertainment, as a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), remains the credited copyright holder.

==Distribution==
Domestically, MGM currently distributes its own films and others it acquires from third parties through Amazon MGM Studios Distribution, as well as films produced by the relaunches of Orion Pictures and American International Pictures, and the 2024 iteration of United Artists. They were previously distributed by United Artists Releasing, the former Mirror Releasing, from 2019 to 2023. Internationally, MGM&#x27;s films are currently distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, following a four-year deal with Universal Pictures mostly through United International Pictures, of which MGM is a former member (see below).

From 1924 to 1973 (worldwide) and 1981 to 2010 (domestically), MGM has theatrically distributed most of its movies entirely in-house, as well as those of United Artists after July 1981 and Orion Pictures after April 1997. In October 2017, seven years after shutting down their major distribution operations, MGM re-entered US theatrical distribution by launching an American joint venture with Annapurna Pictures that will share distribution financing between the two companies and release certain MGM and Annapurna films, beginning with the 2018 remake of &quot;Death Wish&quot;.

There were also periods when MGM outsourced distribution to other companies. From 1973 to 1981, United Artists distributed MGM&#x27;s films in North America while Cinema International Corporation released them overseas. In 1981, United Artists&#x27; international arm was combined by CIC to form United International Pictures. MGM&#x27;s arrangement with that company lasted until 2000, when it made an arrangement with 20th Century Fox for international distribution. From 2005 to 2016, the Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group (later Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group) has distributed certain films. From 2006 to 2010, Alliance Films handled Canadian distribution of some of its products. From 2019 to 2022, Universal Pictures International distributed MGM films overseas.

MGM also distributed films from Carolco Pictures (1994–1995, in North America), Rysher Entertainment (1996–1997), and The Weinstein Company/Dimension Films (2006–2008, in the United States), as well as currently handling select international distribution of Annapurna Pictures&#x27; releases.

From 2006 to September 2008, MGM distributed films produced or acquired by The Weinstein Company (TWC). Weinstein preferred the deal brought carriage on Showtime. Prints and marketing were paid for by TWC, while MGM was paid for booking theaters. With TWC agreeing to a direct deal with Showtime and MGM not intending to renew the distribution deal, TWC and MGM agreed to end the distribution deal three months early in September 2008.

===Other international arrangements===
In 2012, MGM signed a deal with Forum Film to release its films in Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Israel; Forum Film has also been known to release some of MGM&#x27;s films in Czech Republic/Slovakia. That same year, in Denmark, Sweden and Norway, MGM arranged to get its films distributed through AB Svensk Filmindustri, which was renamed to SF Studios in 2016. Also in 2012, it arranged to have its films distributed by FS Film (now SF Film Finland) to release its films in Finland and with ZON Lusomundo (now NOS Audiovisuais) to release its films in Portugal.

In 2018, for select films, MGM arranged international distribution with Entertainment One (for the Canadian market), Vertigo Releasing (for the UK market), Rialto Distribution (for the Australian market), Ascot Elite Entertainment Group (for the Swiss market), BF Distribution (for the Argentine market), Dutch FilmWorks (for the Dutch market), Kinepolis Film Distribution (for the Belgian film market), Odeon (for the Greek market), OctoArts Films (for the Filipino market), Universum Film (for the German market), Filmax International (for the Spanish market), Hollywood International Film Exchange/Big Screen Entertainment Group (for the Chinese market), Shaw Organisation (for the Singaporean market), and Showgate (for the Japanese market). Paramount Pictures distributed the 2018 remake of &quot;Death Wish&quot; for the French market.

<text>Taddeo Zuccaro (or Zuccari) (1 September 15292 September 1566) was an Italian painter, one of the most popular members of the Roman mannerist school.

==Biography==
Zuccaro was born in Sant&#x27;Angelo in Vado, near Urbino, the son of Ottaviano Zuccaro, an almost unknown painter. His brother Federico, born around 1540, was also a painter and architect. As a young man Taddeo was to be encouraged by Pompeo da Fano.
Zuccaro moved to Rome by age 14, and mainly trained himself by copying earlier masters. He succeeded at an early age in gaining a knowledge of painting and in finding patrons to employ him.The principal formative influences on him were the façade decorations of Polidoro da Caravaggio. When he was seventeen a pupil of Correggio, named Daniele da Parma, engaged him to assist in painting a series of frescoes in a chapel at Vitto near Sora, on the borders of the Abruzzi (not corroborated by Freedberg). Zuccaro returned to Rome in 1548, and began his career as a fresco painter, by executing a series of scenes in monochrome from the life of Marcus Furius Camillus on the front of the palace of a wealthy Roman named Jacopo Mattei. From that time his success was assured, and he was largely employed by the popes Julius III and Paul IV, by the della Rovere duke of Urbino, and by other rich patrons. He is documented to have worked alongside Prospero Fontana in decorating the Villa Giulia. In 1556, he painted frescoed &quot;Scenes of the Passion&quot; in the &quot;Cappella Mattei&quot; of Santa Maria della Consolazione.

His best frescoes were a historical series in &quot;quadro riportato&quot; painted on the walls and ceiling of Villa Farnese at Caprarola, built for Cardinal Alessandro Farnese, for which Zuccaro also designed a great quantity of rich decorations in stucco relief after the style of Giulio Romano and other pupils of Raphael. He also painted &quot;Histories of Alexander&quot; in the Castello Orsini at Bracciano. Nearly all his paintings were large, rapidly executed frescos, often in chiaroscuro or monochrome. 

Zuccaro borrowed elements from both the High Renaissance style and Mannerism, combining figures of natural proportion and idealized form with intense emotion. Stylistically, he also displays a Mannerist taste for sculpted physicality characteristic of Michelangelo. Vasari praised his compositional skill and the refined fluidity and vigour of his style, singling out his treatment of heads, hands and nudes.

Zuccaro&#x27;s easel pictures are less common than his decorative frescoes. A small painting on copper of the &quot;Adoration of the Shepherds&quot;, formerly in the collection of James II, is now at Hampton Court Palace. The Caprarola frescoes were engraved and published by Prenner, &quot;Illustri Fatti Farnesiani Coloriti nel Real Palazzo di Caprarola&quot; (Rome, 1748–50).

Around 1558, he painted a ceiling fresco, &quot;The Martyrdom of Saint Paul&quot;, in the Frangipani Chapel in San Marcello al Corso in Rome.

He died in Rome in 1566, and was buried in the Pantheon, not far from Raphael.

<text>Federico Zuccaro, also known as Federico Zuccari and Federigo Zucchero ( July/August 1609), was an Italian painter, draughtsman, architect and writer. He worked in various cities in Italy, as well as in other countries such as Spain, France, the Spanish Netherlands and England. He was an important representative of late Mannerism in Italian art.

==Life and work==
Zuccaro was born in Sant&#x27;Angelo in Vado, near Urbino (Marche), then in the Duchy of Urbino. His parents were the painter Ottaviano de Zucharellis, who changed his surname to Zuccaro in 1569, and Antonia Neri. He was the third child of eight. His siblings were called Taddeo, Bartolomea, Federico, Iacopo, Lucio, Maurizio, Aloysio and Marco Antonio.

In 1550 when he was barely 11 years old, his parents brought him to Rome to study law but Federico preferred a career in art. He trained and worked in the workshop of his elder brother Taddeo who had become a successful painter in Rome. He became quickly integrated into the team of his brother and assisted with the workshop&#x27;s commissions. Around 1560 he was able to join a group of artists who worked for pope Pius IV at the Vatican where he made decorations for the Casino in the garden and the cycle with the &quot;History of Moses&quot; at the Belvedere which were commenced in 1660. He helped his brother on the fresco decorations at the Villa Farnese at Caprarola. 

He left his work on this commission to travel to Venice to work for private Venetian patron, Giovanni Grimani, the patriarch of Aquileia. He made decorations for the Palazzo Grimani di Santa Maria Formosa in Venice and painted frescoes and the altarpiece of the patriarch&#x27;s chapel in San Francesco della Vigna. During this period in Venice, he met the prominent architect Palladio and the Florentine writer Anton Francesco Doni. They were active in various literary and artistic academies to which they introduced him. He collaborated with Palladio on the design of sets for the theater company Compagnia della Calza degli Accesi and in March 1565 they visited together Cividale del Friuli. He tried unsuccessfully to obtain the commissions for the decoration of the Scuola di San Rocco and the wall with the Paradise fresco in the Doge&#x27;s Palace. He used his period in Venice to copy works of other masters of the 15th and 16th centuries, including some pages of the precious Grimani Breviary, a manuscript illumination produced by Flemish artists between 1515 and 1520.
In 1565 Zuccaro left Venice and traveled to Florence where he had been introduced to some important people by his Florentine friends in Venice. He arrived not long before the elaborate wedding of the Grand Duke of Tuscany Francesco I de&#x27; Medici with Joanna of Austria on December 1565. Giorgio Vasari, who was in charge of the organisation of the artistic and decorative preparations for the festive occasion, entrusted him with the task of painting in grisaille stories. These were to be used to decorate a fake arch and the great drop-scene that closed off one of the sides of the Sala dei Cinquecento in the Palazzo Vecchio, where the wedding was to take place. A preparatory sketch in colour depicting hunting scenes near Florence is the only item that survives in relation to his contribution.

After returning to Rome in 1566, he found artistic success with his Annunciation (lost) in the church of the Jesuits in Piazza del Collegio Romano and with frescoes in Villa d&#x27;Este at Tivoli. His brother Taddeo died suddenly aged 37, on 2 September 1566. He took over all the ongoing commissions of his brother. This kept him busy for many years. He worked extensively on the fresco decorations at the Villa Farnese at Caprarola. In the summer of 1569, a conflict over payments arose between Zuccaro and Cardinal Farnese as a result of which Federico was sent away from Caprarola where he was replaced by Jacopo Bertoia of Parma. Upset by this event, Federico painted and then made copies of a satirical composition which was inspired by the lost painting of the ancient Greek painter Apelles called Calumny of Apelles as described by the ancient author Lucian. In the painting Apelles had expressed his unhappiness with his ignorant patron King Midas. In his painting, Zuccaro depicts King Midas with donkey ears while the painter hero is led away under the protection of the Roman god Mercury. Through this painting Zuccaro for the first time expressed the feelings of being misunderstood by ignorant patron that would accompany him in the remainder of his career. In 1569, with Taddeo&#x27;s team of assistants dispersed, Federico began to work mostly for the free market.
On 22 June 1573 he set out for Paris after accepting to work in the service of Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine, a member of the powerful House of Guise. He arrived in Paris on 24 August 1573. He may have seen Leonardo da Vinci&#x27;s Mona Lisa when he visited the Palace of Fontainebleau near Paris. From Paris he traveled on 14 August 1574 to Antwerp where he arrived six days later. He visited Brussels, where he prepared a series of cartoons for the tapestry-weavers. On 16 March 1575 he left Antwerp for England, where he stayed until 8 August 1575. In England he received a commission from Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester to portray himself and Queen Elizabeth. Of the portraits of both only the drawings are preserved, dated “1575” and “in london magio 1575.” He also painted Mary, Queen of Scots, Sir Nicholas Bacon, Sir Francis Walsingham, Lord High Admiral Howard. Upon learning that the Grand Duke Francesco I de&#x27; Medici wished to commission him with the completion of the &quot;Last Judgement&quot; in the dome of Santa Maria del Fiore in Florence, left unfinished by Giorgio Vasari upon his death in 1574, he immediately decided to return to Italy. On his return trip he stopped over in Antwerp from 18 to 30 August.

In the execution of the Last Judgement in Florence he only relied in Vasari&#x27;s general proportional scheme while creating his own original design by changing the manner of representation, technique and style. He painted a portrait of a &quot;Man with Two Dogs&quot; in the Pitti Palace (Florence), and the &quot;Dead Christ and Angels&quot; in the Galleria Borghese (Rome). In 1585, he accepted an offer by Philip II of Spain to decorate the new Escorial at a yearly salary of 2,000 crowns. He worked at the palace from January 1586 to end of 1588, when he returned to Rome. His paintings (like those of El Greco before him) were not in line with the austere artistic preferences of the king and many were painted over or heavily retouched after he left. However the parting was amicable: &quot;We must not blame him, but those who sent him to us&quot;, said Philip. He was succeeded by Pellegrino Tibaldi. He there founded in 1595, under a charter confirmed by Pope Sixtus V, the Accademia di San Luca, of which he was the first president. Bartolomeo Carducci is said to have studied with him.

In 1603 he spent time in his birthplace Sant&#x27;Angelo in Vado, where he completed the Zuccari altarpiece at the monastery of Santa Caterina. He was in Venice, where he perfected the work in the Great Council room at the Doge Palace (signed, dated “1582 / PERFECIT AN. 1603” and bearing his emblem, a lily sugar loaf). He was given a gold necklace and the title of cavaliere knight as his reward for completing this work. From Venice he travelled to Pavia where, together with Cesare Nebbia, he frescoed the hall of the Collegio Borromeo, a work commissioned by Cardinal Federico Borromeo.

Zuccari travelled from one court to another. The last stages of his journey took him to Emilia and Romagna. Following a brief illness, he died in July 1609 in Ancona, in the home of a gentleman with whom he was staying and who arranged for his burial.
==Draughtsman==

He was a prolific draughtsman and left a large number of preliminary studies for his paintings. He is the author of one of the most complete illustrations of the Divina Commedia of Dante which he created between 1586 and 1588 during his stay in Spain. The set of 88 sheets was kept by the artist throughout his life and were part of his estate at the time of his death. The sheets are now in the collection of the Uffizi in Florence.

He created around in 1595 a series of 20 drawings, which illustrate the early life of his older brother Taddeo, starting with the hardships and disappointments during the period of his training in Rome until his first artistic successes at the age of 18. In addition to 16 scenes depicting Taddeo&#x27;s life, the series includes four drawings of allegorical Virtues flanking the Zuccaro emblem. The set is kept at the Getty Center.
==Art writer==
Zuccaro also published books on art theory and art history. In his book &quot;L&#x27;idea de&#x27; Pittori, Scultori, ed Architetti&quot; (1607) he sets out a complex theoretical exposition on the idea of design.
==Selected fresco projects==
He was involved in the following fresco projects:

* Decoration of the Casina Pio IV, Rome
* Grimani Chapel, San Francesco della Vigna, Venice
*Monumental staircase, Palazzo Grimani, Venice
* Pucci Chapel in the church of Trinità dei Monti, Rome

<text>Giacomo Francesco Zuccarelli (commonly known as Francesco Zuccarelli, ; 15 August 1702 – 30 December 1788) was an Italian artist of the late Baroque or Rococo period. He is considered to be the most important landscape painter to have emerged from his adopted city of Venice during the mid-eighteenth century, and his Arcadian views became popular throughout Europe and especially in England where he resided for two extended periods. His patronage extended to the nobility, and he often collaborated with other artists such as Antonio Visentini and Bernardo Bellotto. In 1768, Zuccarelli became a founding member of the Royal Academy of Arts, and upon his final return to Italy, he was elected president of the Venetian Academy. In addition to his rural landscapes which frequently incorporated religious and classical themes, Zuccarelli created devotional pieces and on occasion did portraiture. Besides paintings, his varied output included etchings, drawings, and designs for tapestries as well as a set of Old Testament playing cards.

Despite the fame he experienced in his lifetime, Zuccarelli&#x27;s reputation declined in the early 19th century with naturalism becoming increasingly favoured in landscapes. Turner criticized him in mild terms while confessing that his figures could be beautiful, paving the way for more severe Victorian assessments. In 1959, the art historian Michael Levey offered suggestions for why Zuccarelli held such wide contemporary appeal among the English, concluding that his best work is highly decorative. More recently, since the 1990s there has been a renewed focus on Zuccarelli among Italian scholars, who have given him prominence in several books and articles, and his paintings and drawings are regularly shown in exhibitions.

==Rome and Tuscany (1702–32)==
The third-youngest of four sons, Giacomo Francesco Zuccarelli was born at Pitigliano, in southern Tuscany, on 15 August 1702. His prosperous father Bartolomeo owned several local vineyards, and also in the northwest not far from Pisa, a shop offering kitchen tools and spices. Around the age of eleven or twelve, Zuccarelli began his apprenticeship in Rome with the portrait painters Giovanni Maria Morandi (1622–1717) and his pupil Pietro Nelli (1672–1740), under whose tutelage he learned the elements of design while absorbing the lessons of Roman classicism. Zuccarelli completed his first commission in his hometown of Pitigliano in the years 1725–27, a pair of chapel altarpieces. With the sponsorship of the Florentine art connoisseur, Niccolò Gabburri (1676–1742), from 1728 to 1731 he devoted his energies mostly to etching, eventually producing at least 43 prints, the majority consisting of two series which recorded the deteriorating frescoes of Giovanni da San Giovanni (1592–1636) and Andrea del Sarto (1486–1531). During his five years spent in Florence, though preoccupied with figurative subjects, he began to experiment with drawings in the landscape, as shown by works now preserved in the department of prints and drawings at the Uffizi, including a view of the Tuscan capital. According to Luigi Lanzi, writing in the 1790s, the Roman landscape painter and etcher Paolo Anesi (1697–1773) was the key mentor of Zuccarelli in the genre which eventually led to his renown.

==Twenty years in Venice (1732–52)==

In 1732, after a stay of several months in Bologna, Zuccarelli relocated to Venice. Prior to his arrival in the Republic, the death of Marco Ricci in 1730 had created an opening in the field of landscape painting amid a marketplace crowded with history painters. While continuing to paint religious and mythological works, he increasingly devoted his attention to landscapes, drawing inspiration from the classicism of Claude and the Roman school. His early paintings from the 1730s show briefly the influence of Alessandro Magnasco, and for a longer period, of Ricci. Zuccarelli brought a more mellow and airy palette to the typically Venetian colours, and using tonal values of higher luminous content than Ricci, the figures in his idyllic landscapes came to life. An almost immediate success in Venice, he enjoyed early patronage, from amongst others, Marshal Schulenburg; Joseph (Consul) Smith, who became his longtime patron; and Francesco Algarotti; who recommended him to the Elector of Saxony, Augustus III of Poland. In 1735, Zuccarelli married Giustina Agata Simonetti in the church of Santa Maria Zobenigo in Venice, and they had four daughters, the first two dying as infants, followed by two sons. He attended the baptism of the daughter of the painter Gaspare Diziani in 1743, and he often worked with other artists, including Bernardo Bellotto and Antonio Visentini. Under the auspices of Consul Smith, during the mid–1740s he produced with Visentini a series featuring neo-Palladian architecture, as can be seen in &quot;Burlington House&quot; (1746). The most interesting of the Zuccarelli and Visentini collaborations was a set of 52 playing cards with Old Testament subjects published in Venice in 1748. The hand-coloured scenes are treated in a light manner; the suits are circles, diamonds, hearts, and jars, each containing a mixture of inscribed emblems; and the cards begin with the creation of Adam and end with a battle scene that has an elephant carrying a castle. The outstanding achievement of his first Venetian period was a series of seven canvases, now located at Windsor Castle, which according to a note in an 18th-century manuscript catalogue, represent the biblical characters of Rebecca with Jacob and Esau. The tall paintings are delicately painted and dream-like, and most likely were originally situated at Consul Smith&#x27;s villa at Mogliano Veneto. He also occasionally created pastiches of various 17th-century Dutch masters.

In the years 1748 to 1751, Zuccarelli made frequent trips to Bergamo, invited by his friend Francesco Maria Tassi. Through Tassi, he met Cesare Femi, a student of the portrait painter Fra Galgario, and under his influence he realized three portraits now held at the Accademia Carrara.

Around this time, Zuccarelli&#x27;s paint handling became more responsive to mood, utilizing bright colours that demonstrate a vibrant quality even though thinly laid on. The artist Richard Wilson painted a portrait of Zuccarelli in 1751 at Venice, and Zuccarelli was influential in redirecting Wilson away from portraits and towards landscape painting. During the following year, Zuccarelli discussed the techniques of Italian Renaissance painters with Joshua Reynolds, with Zuccarelli expressing the opinion that Paolo Veronese and Tintoretto painted on gesso grounds, while Titian did not.

==First English period (1752–1762)==

According to Henry Angelo, it was Richard Dalton, the royal librarian, who persuaded Zuccarelli to travel to England. Consul Smith was also likely involved in some way. A splendid canvas of the artist&#x27;s early English period, signed and dated 1753, depicts a cheerful country festival. The Arcadian style remains his best known, where nature is transfigured into pleasant scenery, representing a platonic golden age, pervaded with beauty and love.

His decorative talent resulted in diverse work, including the design of tapestries with the weaver Paul Saunders at Holkham Hall. Based on the tapestry cartoons, Zuccarelli was commissioned in 1758 by Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester to produce the corresponding paintings of Oriental themes, such as &quot;Pair with Dromedary&quot;.

By November 1757, Zuccarelli had become a member of the Dilettante Society. In 1760, he painted the elegiac &quot;Et in Arcadio Ego&quot;, a work described as an &quot;admirable picture&quot; by the poet George Keate. In the same year, Zuccarelli borrowed from Shakespeare, depicting a scene from &quot;Macbeth&quot; where Macbeth and Banquo encounter the three witches, noteworthy as being one of the first paintings to portray theatrical characters in a landscape. The impetus of the work may have come from the portrayals of Macbeth by the actor David Garrick, a later acquaintance. Its initial genesis was a pen and ink sketch, followed by paintings on panels and then canvas.

In this period, he also produced vedute, a genre new to him, seen for example in &quot;A View of the River Thames from Richmond Hill looking towards Twickenham&quot;, and the &quot;View of Vicenza with Ancient Monuments&quot;. Zuccarelli held a sale of his canvases in 1762 at Prestage and Hobbs in London, before his departure for Italy. The pictures listed for sale comprise a heterogeneous lot, including religious scenes, a portrait, the Four Seasons, and an Arabian horse Also in 1762, King George III acquired thirty of his works through the purchase of much of Consul Smith&#x27;s extensive art collection and library in Venice.

==Venetian interlude (1762–1764)==

Zuccarelli arrived in Venice in September 1762, and he became a member of the Venetian Academy in 1763. There is only one known painting from this interval, the rather academic &quot;St. John the Baptist&quot;, a composition required by the academy after gaining admittance. Zuccarelli was induced to journey back to London in 1764 by his friend Algarotti&#x27;s bequest of a cameo and group of drawings made to Lord Chatham.

==Second English period (1765–1771)==
On this second visit to England, Zuccarelli was lauded by the English nobility and critics alike, and invited to exhibit at leading art societies. He continued to draw from diverse sources, as indicated by a work in a private collection. The peasant woman breast-feeding her child in a landscape shows the influence of Flemish-Dutch artists, Nordic clothing, and hints of Thomas Gainsborough, a favourite referent of Zuccarelli during the 1760s.

The artist contributed works to shows held by the Free Society of Artists in 1765, 1766, and 1782. In 1767, his painting &quot;Macbeth and the Witches&quot;, probably a third version, was exhibited at The Society of Artists. Shown alongside was the &quot;Journey of Jacob&quot;. The two paintings had differing compositional styles. While &quot;Macbeth&quot; had quick and almost unformed brushstrokes, &quot;Jacob&quot; revealed careful attention to detail. &quot;Macbeth&quot; later achieved widespread dissemination through a 1770 engraving by William Woollett.

Zuccarelli was a founding member, in 1768, of the Royal Academy of Arts. King George III commissioned the out-sized painting &quot;River Landscape with the Finding of Moses&quot; (1768), a privilege granted to no other Italian artist. The painting, impeccable from a formal point of view, clearly shows the influences of Gaspard Dughet as well as Claude Lorrain. In 1769, Zucccarelli exhibited at the inaugural exhibition of the Royal Academy, showing two landscapes and figures; in 1770, three landscapes, a &quot;St. John Preaching in the Wilderness&quot;, and a &quot;Holy Family&quot;; and finally, in 1771, another &quot;Holy Family&quot;. As a postscript, the &quot;Finding of Moses&quot; was shown in 1773, two years after his departure to Italy.

==Final years in Italy (1771–88)==
Upon his return to Venice in 1771, Zuccarelli was received with affection and pride, and in September of that year, the artistic community appointed him director of the Academy of Fine Arts of Venice, followed by president in the following month. Now entering his eighth decade, he departed from his accustomed Arcadian landscapes and adopted an approach more congenial to the current Venetian taste, neoclassical in outlook, harkening back to his youthful emulation of Ricci. A masterpiece of his late maturity, the unusual &quot;Landscape with Bridge, Figures, and a Statue&quot;, adheres to the model of Francesco Guardi who reinvented capricci by casting them with pre-romantic moods, while at the same time, the composition gently mocks Guardi, by the placement of the statue in the centre of the composition. The painting has many elements common to Zuccarelli, such as a fisherman, waterfall, bridge with animals, traveller, and a peasant, but is done with quick brushstrokes, a technique characteristic of this period, and the atmosphere is one of pathos, recalling his earlier &quot;Macbeth and the Witches&quot;. Another beautiful canvas, &quot;Banquet of a Villa&quot;, at which outdoor diners sit at a festive table, is realistic in a manner reminiscent of Pietro Longhi, and the parallel and sloping bands of the landscape are typical of those favoured by English topographical artists. This continued desire to look at fresh approaches, even as he grew old, perhaps helps explain why Zuccarelli showed little interest in his role as president of the ossified Venetian Academy, where he was often absent from sessions. In 1774, without giving notice, and to the consternation of the membership, he departed permanently to Florence.

It is apparent that Zuccarelli kept in contact with Great Britain, for in 1775, he was commissioned for a set of four paintings destined for the Scottish residence of Wedderburn Castle, based on engravings of the ruins of Palmyra, first published by Robert Wood in 1753. The small Turkish-style figures standing amidst the classical ruins are in keeping with other oriental scenes of his late maturity, some of which are similar to paintings done by Giovanni Antonio Guardi for Zuccarelli&#x27;s early patron Marshal Schulenburg in 1746–1747. Having been a member of the Florentine Academy of Design since his youth, Zuccarelli was created &quot;Master of Nudes&quot; at the academy in 1777, a more prestigious designation than that of a painter of landscapes, then considered a minor art form, in comparison to the traditional elite status given to figure drawing. Zuccarelli continued teaching at the academy until its reorganization in 1784.

In his will of 1787, Zuccarelli made his &quot;beloved wife&quot; Giustina his sole heir, and one and a half years later, he died in Florence on 30 December 1788. His lengthy obituary, which appeared in the &quot;Gazzetta Toscana&quot;, described his personality as &quot;straightforward, humble, grateful, compassionate, generous, uniting these solid virtues in the most courteous tactful manner, with much grace in speaking&quot;, and it also took note that since his youth, he possessed a &quot;natural genius&quot; for landscapes.

==Reputation and legacy==
Zuccarelli was one of the few Venetian painters of his era to win universal acclaim, even from critics who rejected the concept of Arcadia. He was especially popular among the followers of Rousseau. Francesco Maria Tassi (1716–1782), in his &quot;Lives of the Painters, Sculptors, and Architects of Bergamo&quot; remarks that Zuccarelli paints &quot;landscapes with the most charming figures and thus excels not only artists of modern times but rivals the great geniuses of the past; for no one previously knew how to combine the delights of an harmonious ground with figures gracefully posed and represented in the most natural colours&quot;. With the move to more representational modes of depicting landscape in the 19th century, negative criticism began to develop, as described by the art historian Michael Levey in a landmark 1959 article, &quot;Francesco Zuccarelli in England.&quot; Turner&#x27;s view was restrained, saying Zuccarelli&#x27;s work was &quot;meretricious&quot;, lacking the charm and grace of Watteau, and yet his figures were &quot;sometimes beautiful&quot;. Victorian writers, among them partisans of Richard Wilson, sensitive to the neglect of their favourite while the Italian flourished, used adjectives such as theatrical and insincere. Levey contributed to a reevaluation of the artist by explaining the appeal of Zuccarelli to his contemporaries, drawing a parallel with the affection of the 18th century English for pastoral poetry, since everyone could recognize a pleasing convention when they saw one; in this case, a fairyland where &quot;the skies are forever blue, the trees forever green.&quot; The exaltation of the rural life as a retreat from the bustle of urbanity had the sanction of a long and distinguished history; for &quot;Virgil had recommended it, Petrarch had practiced it; Zuccarelli was left to illustrate it&quot;; and in Levey&#x27;s continuation, &quot;at its best—in comparison to an age he never saw—Zuccarelli&#x27;s work is highly decorative and still capable of giving pleasure&quot;. While sparsely treated in Italy for much of the 19th and early 20th centuries, the painter never fell into disfavour there as in England. The last few decades have seen a resurgence of interest in Zuccarelli by Italian scholars, notably by Federico Dal Forno, who published an artistic biography with sixty paintings in 1994, and Federica Spadotto, who issued a catalogue raisonné in 2007. In a larger cultural context, modern historians have considered him to be a figure of interest because of his love of escapism, seen as not untypical of the late Baroque.

During the mid to late 18th century Zuccarelli was widely imitated, and artists influenced by him included Richard Wilson, Giuseppe Zais, Giovanni Battista Cimaroli, and Vittorio Amedeo Cignaroli. Among those who created engravings after his work were Joseph Wagner, Fabio Berardi, Giovanni Volpato, Francesco Bartolozzi, and William Woollett.

The &quot;Francesco Zuccarelli Municipal Library and Historical Archives&quot; is located in the Fortezza Orsini Cultural Centre, in Pitigliano, Italy, the town of the artist&#x27;s childhood. Also in the vicinity, the Museum of the Orsini Palace has on permanent exhibit Zuccarelli&#x27;s earliest commissioned altarpieces.

==Identification==
His paintings are rarely signed, yet they often contain a gourd water bottle that was held at the waist by rural Italian women, a punning allusion to his surname, &quot;zucco&quot; being the Italian word for gourd. A defining touch found consistently across the long span of Zuccarelli&#x27;s career is a serene and vaguely sweet expression on the faces of his rounded figures.

<doc id="58824" wikidata="Q1134741" url="?curid=58824" title="Corporate raid">
<text>In business, a corporate raid is the process of buying a large stake in a corporation and then using shareholder voting rights to require the company to undertake novel measures designed to increase the share value, generally in opposition to the desires and practices of the corporation&#x27;s current management. The measures might include replacing top executives, downsizing operations, or liquidating the company.

Corporate raids were particularly common between the 1970s and the 1990s in the United States. By the end of the 1980s, management of many large publicly traded corporations had adopted legal countermeasures designed to thwart potential hostile takeovers and corporate raids, including poison pills, golden parachutes, and increases in debt levels on the company&#x27;s balance sheet. In later years, some corporate raiding practices have been used by &quot;activist shareholders&quot;, who purchase equity stakes in a corporation to influence its board of directors and put public pressure on its management.

==History==
Corporate raids became a hallmark of investors in the 1970s and 1980s, particularly highlighted by the public suicide of Eli Black. Among the most notable corporate raiders of the 1970s and 1980s were Louis Wolfson, Carl Icahn, Victor Posner, Meshulam Riklis, Nelson Peltz, Robert M. Bass, T. Boone Pickens, Paul Bilzerian, Harold Clark Simmons, Kirk Kerkorian, James Goldsmith, Saul Steinberg and Asher Edelman. These investors used a number of the same tactics and targeted the same type of companies as more traditional leveraged buyouts and in many ways could be considered a forerunner of the later private equity firms. In fact it is Posner, one of the first &quot;corporate raiders&quot; who is often credited with coining the term &quot;leveraged buyout&quot; or &quot;LBO&quot;.

Victor Posner, who had made a fortune in real estate investments in the 1930s and 1940s, acquired a major stake in DWG Corporation in 1966. Having gained control of the company, he used it as an investment vehicle that could execute takeovers of other companies. Posner and DWG are perhaps best known for the hostile takeover of Sharon Steel Corporation in 1969, one of the earliest such takeovers in the United States. Posner&#x27;s investments were typically motivated by attractive valuations, balance sheets and cash flow characteristics. Because of its high debt load, Posner&#x27;s DWG generated attractive but highly volatile returns and ultimately landed in financial difficulty. In 1987, Sharon Steel entered Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

Carl Icahn developed a reputation as a ruthless &quot;corporate raider&quot; after his hostile takeover of TWA in 1985. The result of that takeover was Icahn systematically selling TWA&#x27;s assets to repay the debt he used to purchase the company, which was described as &quot;asset stripping&quot;.

Icahn also attempted the grand prize of U.S. Steel, launching a hostile takeover for 89% of the industrial giant for $7 billion ($ billion today) in late 1986, which was rebuffed finally by CEO David Roderick on January 8, 1987.

T. Boone Pickens&#x27; hostile takeover bid of Gulf Oil in 1984 led to shock that such a large company could be raided. Gulf eventually sold out to Chevron for a then-record $13.3 billion ($ billion today) &quot;white knight&quot; buyout.

Paul Bilzerian launched a number of takeover bids including Cluett Peabody &amp; Company, Hammermill Paper Company, Pay n Pack Stores, Allied Stores and the Singer Corporation. All of his takeover bids were for all cash and for all shares and he refused any greenmail. Bilzerian was indicted for Schedule13(d) disclosure violations and despite his claims of innocence he was convicted in 1989. After spending thirty years fighting the government in his attempt to overturn his conviction, he renounced his US citizenship in 2019.

British raider Beazer also launched several successful hostile takeovers in the 1980s, the largest being that of Koppers in early 1988 for $1.81 billion ($ billion today).

Many of the corporate raiders of the 1980s were onetime clients of Michael Milken, whose investment banking firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert helped raise s of capital which corporate raiders could use to make legitimate attempts to take over companies and provide high-yield debt financing of the buyouts.

===Ronald Perelman and Revlon===
Drexel Burnham raised a $100 million in 1984 for Nelson Peltz and his holding company Triangle Industries (later Triarc) to give credibility for takeovers, representing the first major blind pool raised for this purpose. Two years later, in 1986, Wickes Companies, a holding company run by Sanford Sigoloff, would raise a $1.2 billion blind pool. In later years, Milken and Drexel would shy away from certain of the more &quot;notorious&quot; corporate raiders as the firm and the private equity industry attempted to move upscale.

In 1985, Milken raised $750 million for a similar blind pool for Ronald Perelman, which would ultimately prove instrumental in acquiring his biggest target: The Revlon Corporation. In 1980, Ronald Perelman, the son of a wealthy Philadelphia businessman, and future &quot;corporate raider&quot;, having made several small but successful buyouts, acquired MacAndrews &amp; Forbes, a distributor of licorice extract and chocolate, which Perelman&#x27;s father had tried and failed to acquire 10 years earlier. Perelman would ultimately divest the company&#x27;s core business and use MacAndrews &amp; Forbes as a holding company investment vehicle for subsequent leveraged buyouts including Technicolor, Inc., Pantry Pride and Revlon. Using the Pantry Pride subsidiary of his holding company, MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings, Perelman&#x27;s overtures were rebuffed. Repeatedly rejected by the company&#x27;s board and management, Perelman continued to press forward with a hostile takeover, raising his offer from an initial bid of $47.50 per share until it reached $53.00 per share. After Revlon received a higher offer from a white knight, private equity firm Forstmann Little &amp; Company, Perelman&#x27;s Pantry Pride finally was able to make a successful bid for Revlon, valuing the company at $2.7 billion. The buyout would prove troubling, burdened by a heavy debt load. Under Perelman&#x27;s control, Revlon sold 4 divisions: two were sold for $1 billion, its vision care division was sold for $574 million, and its National Health Laboratories division was spun out to the public market in 1988. Revlon also made acquisitions including Max Factor in 1987 and Betrix in 1989, later selling them to Procter &amp; Gamble in 1991. Perelman exited the bulk of his holdings in Revlon through an IPO in 1996 and subsequent sales of stock. As of December 31, 2007, Perelman still retains a minority ownership interest in Revlon. The Revlon takeover, because of its well-known brand, was profiled widely by the media and brought new attention to the emerging boom in leveraged buyout activity. Litigation associated with the takeover has also become standard reading for introductory business organization classes in most law schools, introducing what have come to be known as &quot;Revlon duties&quot; for boards of companies that are up for auction.

===Decline of the corporate raiders===

In the late 1980s several famous corporate raiders suffered from bad investments financed by large amounts of leverage, ultimately losing money for their investors. Additionally, with the fall of Michael Milken and the subsequent collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert, the credit lines for these investors dried up. By the end of the decade, management of many large publicly traded corporations reacted negatively to the threat of potential hostile takeover or corporate raid and pursued drastic defensive measures including poison pills, golden parachutes and increasing debt levels on the company&#x27;s balance sheet. Finally, in the 1990s the overall price of the American stock market increased, which reduced the number of situations in which a company&#x27;s share price was low with respect to the assets that it controlled. By the end of the 1990s, the corporate raider moniker was used less frequently as private equity firms pursued different tactics than their predecessors. In later years, many of the corporate raiders would be re-characterized as &quot;activist shareholders&quot;, such as Carl Icahn during his 2008 profile on CBS&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot;.

==Media reflections of corporate raiders==

Although private equity rarely received a thorough treatment in popular culture, several films did feature stereotypical &quot;corporate raiders&quot; prominently. Among the most notable examples of private equity featured in motion pictures included:
* &quot;Gordon Gekko&quot;, &quot;Wall Street&quot; (1987) and &quot;Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps&quot; (2010) – The notorious &quot;corporate raider&quot; and greenmailer, Gordon Gekko (played by Michael Douglas), represents a synthesis of the worst features of various famous private equity figures. In the film, the character intends to manipulate an ambitious young stockbroker to take over a failing, but decent, airline. Although Gekko makes a pretense of caring about the airline, his intentions prove to be to destroy the airline, strip its assets and lay off its employees before raiding the corporate pension fund. Gekko would become a symbol in popular culture for unrestrained greed (with the signature line, &quot;Greed, for lack of a better word, is good&quot;) that would be attached to the private equity industry. &quot;Sir Lawrence Wildman&quot;, based on Sir James Goldsmith, also appears in &quot;Wall Street&quot;.
* &quot;Larry the Liquidator&quot;, &quot;Other People&#x27;s Money&quot; (1990) – A self-absorbed corporate raider &quot;Larry the Liquidator&quot; (Danny DeVito), sets his sights on New England Wire and Cable, a small-town business run by family patriarch (Gregory Peck) who is principally interested in protecting his employees and the town. Larry ultimately wins over the shareholders when he admits he did not cause the company to fail; rather it was making outmoded equipment, using the analogy of 19th Century buggy whip makers who failed to realize they were being superseded by the automobile.
* &quot;Edward Lewis&quot;, &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; (1990) – Corporate raider Edward Lewis (Richard Gere) attempts to make a hostile takeover of Morse Industries. Edward explains what he does for a living to Vivian (Julia Roberts): he buys large companies that are on the verge of bankruptcy, breaks them up and sells them in smaller parts, at a price that&#x27;s more than the whole company, for profit.
* &quot;That Guy&quot;, &quot;Futurama&quot; season 3 episode, &quot;Future Stock&quot; (2002) – A sleazy businessman from the 1980s who froze himself to the early-31st century in hopes for a cure of bonitis. During the Planet Express company stockholders&#x27; meeting, Fry elects That Guy as the company&#x27;s CEO, beating Professor Farnsworth by one vote. That Guy finds a way to commit a hostile takeover for the company which concerns the crew (including Zoidberg, though forgave him after he offered him a sandwich), only to announce that he is selling Planet Express to MomCorp, Mom&#x27;s ruthless robot manufacturing company. The character resembles that of Gordon Gecko from &quot;Wall Street&quot;.
* &quot;Devin Weston&quot;, &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot; (2013) – Weston is initially presented as a self-made billionaire who made his fortune as a venture capitalist. In reality, he is a corporate raider who finds loopholes in legal contracts that he uses to strip companies of their assets simply because he can, and because he enjoys knowing that his victims can do nothing to stop him. Over the course of the game, he attempts to force the Richards Majestic film studio into bankruptcy by sabotaging production of a major film, leaving the owners with no choice but to sell their stake in the company to him. Once he has a majority shareholding (and after collecting the insurance on the film), he plans to tear the studios down and build luxury apartments in their place. The player is able to prevent this from happening by retrieving the film stolen by Weston, but this causes Weston to harbour a grudge against the player character, and he becomes one of the primary antagonists of the game. If the player chooses Ending C, Weston is killed along with the other three antagonists.

<text>Johann Heinrich Daniel Zschokke (22 March 177127 June 1848) was a German, later Swiss, author and reformer. Most of his life was spent, and most of his reputation earned, in Switzerland. He had an extensive civil service career, and wrote histories, fiction and other works which were widely known.

==Biography==

===Youth and early career in Prussia===
Born in Magdeburg, Prussia, he was educated at the monasterial () school and at the Altstädter Gymnasium there. He ran away from school at 17, and spent some time as playwright with a company of traveling actors. Later, he studied philosophy, theology and history at the University of Frankfurt (Oder), where in 1792 he established himself as a privatdozent (associate professor or lecturer).

While a privatdozent, Zschokke created a sensation by publishing the extravagant novel, (Abaellino, the great bandit, 1793; subsequently also dramatized), modelled on Schiller&#x27;s , and the melodramatic tragedy (1796).

===Move to Switzerland===
The Prussian government declined to make him a full professor, and in 1796 Zschokke settled in Switzerland, where he ran an educational institution in the castle of Reichenau. The authorities of Graubünden granted him citizenship, and in 1798 he published his . The political disturbances of this year compelled him to close his institution.

===Civil service===
He was, however, sent as a deputy to Aarau, where he was appointed president of the educational department. Soon afterward, the Helvetic executive directory sent him as government commissioner to Unterwalden for the purpose of restoring tranquility. His authority was ultimately extended over the cantons of Uri, Schwyz and Zug. Zschokke distinguished himself by the vigour of his administration and by the enthusiasm with which he devoted himself to the interests of the poorer classes of the community. In 1800, he reorganized the institutions of the Italian cantons and was appointed lieutenant-governor of the canton of Basel.

Zschokke retired from public life when the central government at Bern proposed to re-establish the federal system, but after the changes effected by Napoleon he entered the service of the canton of Aargau, with which he remained connected.

===Writings===
While Zschokke appeared as one of the most distinguished and energetic public men in Switzerland, he still found time to cultivate his favorite literary pursuits, and it is chiefly by his numerous writings, historical and fictitious, that he became known to the world at large. In 1801, he attracted attention by his . Through his popular (Swiss Messenger), the publication of which began in 1804, he exercised a wholesome influence on public affairs; and the like may be said of his , issued from 1807 to 1813. In 1811 he also started a monthly periodical, the . In addition to his 1801 work, he wrote various other historical works, among which are (Contributions to the history of our time, 1811–27) and (History of Switzerland for the Swiss people, 1822, 8th ed. 1849).

Zschokke&#x27;s tales, on which his literary reputation rests, are collected in several series, (Pictures from Switzerland, 5 vols., 1824–25), (16 vols., 1838–39). The best known are:
 (1794), (1794), (1802), , , (1830), (The goldmakers&#x27; village, 1817), and (1845).

In (Hours of devotion, 1809–1816; 27 editions in Zschokke&#x27;s lifetime), which was widely read, he expounded in a rationalistic spirit the fundamental principles of religion and morality. (1842) is a kind of autobiography.

According to the 1911 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, &quot;Zschokke was not a great original writer, but he secured an eminent place in the literature of his time by his enthusiasm for modern ideas in politics and religion, by the sound, practical judgment displayed in his works, and by the energy and lucidity of his style.&quot;

An edition of Zschokke&#x27;s selected works, in forty volumes, was issued in 1824–28. In 1851–54 an edition in thirty-five volumes was published. A new edition of the was published by A. Vögtlin in twelve volumes (1904).

===Later life===
In his later years, Zschokke traveled regularly to Überlingen am Bodensee to enjoy the waters at the city&#x27;s spa; he died at his country house of Blumenhalde on the Aar.

<text>Market capitalization, sometimes referred to as market cap, is the total value of a publicly traded company&#x27;s outstanding common shares owned by stockholders. 

Market capitalization is equal to the market price per common share multiplied by the number of common shares outstanding.

==Description==
Market capitalization is sometimes used to rank the size of companies. It measures only the equity component of a company&#x27;s capital structure, and does not reflect management&#x27;s decision as to how much debt (or leverage) is used to finance the firm. A more comprehensive measure of a firm&#x27;s size is enterprise value (EV), which gives effect to outstanding debt, preferred stock, and other factors. For insurance firms, a value called the embedded value (EV) has been used.

It is also used in ranking the relative size of stock exchanges, being a measure of the sum of the market capitalizations of all companies listed on each stock exchange. The total capitalization of stock markets or economic regions may be compared with other economic indicators (e.g. the Buffett indicator). The total market capitalization of all publicly traded companies in 2023 was approximately US$111 trillion. As of February 2025, the total global market capitalization of all publicly traded companies was approximately US$124 trillion.

=== Historical estimates of world market cap ===
Total market capitalization of all publicly traded companies in the world from 1975 to 2020.
== Calculation ==
Market cap is given by the formula formula_1, where &quot;MC&quot; is the market capitalization, &quot;N&quot; is the number of common shares outstanding, and &quot;P&quot; is the market price per common share.

For example, if a company has 4 million common shares outstanding and the closing price per share is $20, its market capitalization is then $80 million. If the closing price per share rises to $21, the market cap becomes $84 million. If it drops to $19 per share, the market cap falls to $76 million. This is in contrast to mercantile pricing where purchase price, average price and sale price may differ due to transaction costs.

Not all of the outstanding shares trade on the open market. The number of shares trading on the open market is called the float. It is equal to or less than &quot;N&quot; because &quot;N&quot; includes shares that are restricted from trading. The free-float market cap uses just the floating number of shares in the calculation, generally resulting in a smaller number.

== Market cap terms ==

Traditionally, companies were divided into large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap. The terms mega-cap and micro-cap have since come into common use, and nano-cap is sometimes heard. Large caps have a slow growth rate as compared to small caps. Different numbers are used by different indexes; there is no official definition of, or full consensus agreement about, the exact cutoff values. The cutoffs may be defined as percentiles rather than in nominal dollars. The definitions expressed in nominal dollars need to be adjusted over decades due to inflation, population change, and overall market valuation (for example, $1 billion was a large market cap in 1950, but it is not very large now), and market caps are likely to be different country to country.

===In the United States===

FINRA&#x27;s investor education materials state that the following is a typical (not official) categorization of stocks by market capitalization:

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission notes that &quot;nano-cap&quot; stocks, in cases when they&#x27;re separated from micro-caps, are typically defined as stocks with a market capitalization less than $50 million (as of 2013); which is equivalent to less than $ million in .

S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices defines 3 major US indices segmented by market capitalization. The components of these indices are selected by committee, but in order to be eligible, among other requirements, a stock&#x27;s market capitalization at the time of addition must be within the respective range in the following table:

These market cap eligibility criteria are only for addition to these indices, not for continued membership in an index. As a result, an S&amp;P index constituent that appears to violate criteria for addition to that index is not removed unless ongoing conditions warrant an index change.

<doc id="58834" wikidata="Q1058381" url="?curid=58834" title="Leveraged buyout">
<text>A leveraged buyout (LBO) is the acquisition of a company using a significant proportion of borrowed money (leverage) to fund the acquisition with the remainder of the purchase price funded with private equity. The assets of the acquired company are often used as collateral for the financing, along with any equity contributed by the acquiror. 

While corporate acquisitions often employ leverage to finance the purchase of the target, the term &quot;leveraged buyout&quot; is typically only employed when the acquiror is a financial sponsor (a private equity investment firm). 

The use of debt, which normally has a lower cost of capital than equity, serves to reduce the overall cost of financing for the acquisition and enhance returns for the private equity investor. The equity investor can increase their projected returns by employing more leverage, creating incentives to maximize the proportion of debt relative to equity (i.e., debt-to-equity ratio). While the lenders have an incentive to limit the amount of leverage they will provide, in certain cases the acquired company may be &quot;overleveraged&quot;, meaning that the amount of leverage assumed by the target company was too high for the cash flows generated by the company to service the debt. As a result, the increased use of leverage increases the risk of default should the company perform poorly after the buyout. Since the early 2000s, the debt-to-equity ratio in leveraged buyouts has declined significantly, resulting in increased focus on operational improvements and follow-on M&amp;A activity to generate attractive returns. 

LBOs can come in various forms. The first time a company is acquired through a leveraged buyout it can be referred to as a &quot;primary buyout&quot; although this term is not commonly used, whereas the term &quot;secondary buyout&quot; is very commonly used to refer to the leveraged buyout of a company already owned by a private equity sponsor (please note the distinction between &quot;secondary buyouts&quot; and &quot;private equity secondaries&quot;). The terms &quot;management buyout&quot; (MBO) and &quot;management buy-in&quot; (MBI) involve transactions in which the current or former management of the company operate as the financial sponsor or as an active party in the transaction alongside the sponsor. Finally the leveraged buyout of a public company is often referred to as a &quot;take-private&quot; or a &quot;public-to-private&quot; (PtP).

==Characteristics==
A leveraged buyout (LBO) is characterized by the extensive use of debt financing to acquire a company. This financing structure enables private equity firms and financial sponsors to control businesses while investing a relatively small portion of their own equity. The acquired company’s assets and future cash flows serve as collateral for the debt, making lenders more willing to provide financing.

While different firms pursue different strategies, there are some characteristics that hold true across many types of leveraged buyouts:

* High Debt-to-Equity Ratio: 
:LBOs rely on a significant proportion of debt, typically ranging between 50% and 90% of the total purchase price. The remaining portion is financed through equity capital from the financial sponsor.
*Stable and Predictable Cash Flows: 
:Ideal LBO candidates generate consistent operating cash flows to meet debt obligations. Businesses with recurring revenue, high customer retention, and strong profit margins are prime targets.

*Strong Asset Base for Collateral: 
:Companies with tangible assets, such as real estate, inventory, and equipment, provide lenders with security, reducing credit risk.

* Operational and Cost Efficiencies: 
:Financial sponsors aim to improve profitability through cost-cutting measures, operational restructuring, and revenue growth strategies.

*Tax Efficiency: 
:Interest payments on LBO debt are typically tax-deductible, reducing the overall tax burden and improving post-tax cash flows.

*Exit Strategy Focus: 
:Private equity firms plan exit strategies before acquiring a company. Common exit options include an initial public offering (IPO), strategic sale, secondary buyout (SBO), or recapitalization.

Debt volumes of up to 100% of a purchase price have been provided to companies with very stable and secured cash flows, such as real estate portfolios with rental income secured by long-term rental agreements. Typically, debt of 40–60% of the purchase price may be offered. Debt ratios vary significantly among regions and target industries.

Debt for an acquisition comes in two types: senior and junior. Senior debt is secured with the target company&#x27;s assets and has lower interest rates. Junior debt has no security interests and higher interest rates. In big purchases, debt and equity can come from more than one party. Banks can also syndicate debt, meaning they sell pieces of the debt to other banks. Seller notes (or vendor loans) can also happen when the seller uses part of the sale to give the purchaser a loan. In LBOs, the only collateral is the company&#x27;s assets and cash flows. The financial sponsor can treat their investment as common equity, preferred equity, or other securities. Preferred equity pays dividends and has priority over common equity.

In addition to the amount of debt that can be used to fund leveraged buyouts, it is also important to understand the types of companies that private equity firms look for when considering leveraged buyouts.

Another key benefit to the equity investor in a leveraged buyout is the tax deductibility of interest payments on the acquisition financing which can offset the company&#x27;s earnings and reduce the corporate income tax. Of course, the interest income on the interest payments are taxed at ordinary income rates rather than capital gains rates so while the allocation of taxes is shifted from the borrower to the lender, the total income tax generated from the company&#x27;s earnings is often higher than it would be if less leverage were used.

===Management buyouts===

A &quot;management buyout&quot; (MBO) is a form of buyout in which the incumbent management team acquires a sizeable portion of the shares of the company. Similar to an MBO is an MBI (Management Buy In) in which an external management team acquires the shares. 

Management buyouts are usually an indication of a high degree of conviction by management in the future prospects of the business relative to the existing ownership. Often, management is able to secure the company outside of an auction process allowing the management team to acquire the company on favorable terms. In many cases the management may still require additional equity from a financial sponsor, which may also be actively involved in securing the financing for the acquisition. Financial sponsors often find MBOs to be attractive situations as they have the opportunity to align itself with an insider who may have unique perspectives on the company and potential areas of operational improvement.

===Secondary buyouts===
A secondary buyout is the leveraged buyout of a company already owned by a private equity sponsor. A secondary buyout will often provide a realization event for the selling private equity owner(s) and its limited partner investors. Historically, given that private equity firms were extolling their unique ability to source attractive investments and drive value through a leveraged buyout, secondary buyouts were perceived as less attractive than the &quot;primary buyout&quot; of a private company or a &quot;take-private&quot; of a public company and were disdained by investors. Over time, it has been difficult to distinguish a differential investment returns based on the prior owner of the company and secondary buyouts have become a common part of the private equity ecosystem typically representing 25% to 35% of all leverage buyouts. 

For sellers, secondary buyouts have led to faster realizations than an initial public offering which often takes months to prepare and requires years after the IPO to realize the remaining public shares. Similarly the sale to another private equity sponsor may be less complex than the sale to a strategic corporate acquiror which could face regulatory scrutiny or challenges financing the purchase.

Secondary buyouts differ from secondaries which typically involve the acquisition of portfolios of private equity assets including limited partnership stakes and direct investments in corporate securities. More recently GP-led Secondaries, in which a private equity sponsor creates a &quot;continuation fund&quot; to acquire a company from one of its own funds has brought together elements of secondary buyouts and management buyouts.

==History==

===Origins===

The first leveraged buyout may have been the purchase by McLean Industries, Inc. of Pan-Atlantic Steamship Company in January 1955 and Waterman Steamship Corporation in May 1955. Under the terms of that transaction, McLean borrowed $42 million and raised an additional $7 million through an issue of preferred stock. When the deal closed, $20 million of Waterman cash and assets were used to retire $20 million of the loan debt.

Lewis Cullman&#x27;s acquisition of Orkin Exterminating Company in 1964 is among the first significant leveraged buyout transactions. Similar to the approach employed in the McLean transaction, the use of publicly traded holding companies as investment vehicles to acquire portfolios of investments in corporate assets was a relatively new trend in the 1960s, popularized by the likes of Warren Buffett (Berkshire Hathaway) and Victor Posner (DWG Corporation), and later adopted by Nelson Peltz (Triarc), Saul Steinberg (Reliance Insurance) and Gerry Schwartz (Onex Corporation). These investment vehicles would utilize a number of the same tactics and target the same type of companies as more traditional leveraged buyouts and in many ways could be considered a forerunner of the later private-equity firms. In fact, it is Posner who is often credited with coining the term &quot;leveraged buyout&quot; or &quot;LBO.&quot;

The leveraged buyout boom of the 1980s was conceived in the 1960s by a number of corporate financiers, most notably Jerome Kohlberg, Jr. and later his protégé Henry Kravis. Working for Bear Stearns at the time, Kohlberg and Kravis, along with Kravis&#x27; cousin George Roberts, began a series of what they described as &quot;bootstrap&quot; investments. Many of the target companies lacked a viable or attractive exit for their founders, as they were too small to be taken public and the founders were reluctant to sell out to competitors: thus, a sale to an outside buyer might prove attractive. In the following years, the three Bear Stearns bankers would complete a series of buyouts including Stern Metals (1965), Incom (a division of Rockwood International, 1971), Cobblers Industries (1971), and Boren Clay (1973) as well as Thompson Wire, Eagle Motors and Barrows through their investment in Stern Metals. By 1976, tensions had built up between Bear Stearns and Kohlberg, Kravis and Roberts leading to their departure and the formation of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in that year.

===1980s===

In January 1982, former U.S. Secretary of the Treasury William E. Simon and a group of investors acquired Gibson Greetings, a producer of greeting cards, for $80 million, of which only $1 million was rumored to have been contributed by the investors. By mid-1983, just sixteen months after the original deal, Gibson completed a $290 million IPO and Simon made approximately $66 million. The success of the Gibson Greetings investment attracted the attention of the wider media to the nascent boom in leveraged buyouts. Between 1980 and 1990, there were 180 leveraged buyouts involving firms with an aggregate book value of $39.2 billion.

In the summer of 1984 the LBO was a target for virulent criticism by Paul Volcker, then chairman of the Federal Reserve, by John S.R. Shad, chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and other senior financiers. The gist of all the denunciations was that top-heavy reversed pyramids of debt were being created and that they would soon crash, destroying assets and jobs.

During the 1980s, constituencies within acquired companies and the media ascribed the &quot;corporate raid&quot; label to many private equity investments, particularly those that featured a hostile takeover of the company, perceived asset stripping, major layoffs or other significant corporate restructuring activities. Among the most notable investors to be labeled corporate raiders in the 1980s included Carl Icahn, Victor Posner, Nelson Peltz, Robert M. Bass, T. Boone Pickens, Harold Clark Simmons, Kirk Kerkorian, Sir James Goldsmith, Saul Steinberg and Asher Edelman. Carl Icahn developed a reputation as a ruthless corporate raider after his hostile takeover of TWA in 1985. Many of the corporate raiders were onetime clients of Michael Milken, whose investment banking firm, Drexel Burnham Lambert helped raise blind pools of capital with which corporate raiders could make a legitimate attempt to take over a company and provided high-yield debt financing of the buyouts.

One of the final major buyouts of the 1980s proved to be its most ambitious and marked both a high-water mark and a sign of the beginning of the end of the boom that had begun nearly a decade earlier. In 1989, KKR closed in on a $31.1 billion takeover of RJR Nabisco. It was, at that time and for over 17 years following, the largest leveraged buyout in history. The event was chronicled in the book (and later the movie) &quot;Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco&quot;. KKR would eventually prevail in acquiring RJR Nabisco at $109 per share, marking a dramatic increase from the original announcement that Shearson Lehman Hutton would take RJR Nabisco private at $75 per share. A fierce series of negotiations and horse-trading ensued which pitted KKR against Shearson Lehman Hutton and later Forstmann Little &amp; Co. Many of the major banking players of the day, including Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Salomon Brothers, and Merrill Lynch were actively involved in advising and financing the parties. After Shearson Lehman&#x27;s original bid, KKR quickly introduced a tender offer to obtain RJR Nabisco for $90 per share – a price that enabled it to proceed without the approval of RJR Nabisco&#x27;s management. RJR&#x27;s management team, working with Shearson Lehman and Salomon Brothers, submitted a bid of $112, a figure they felt certain would enable them to outflank any response by Kravis&#x27;s team. KKR&#x27;s final bid of $109, while a lower dollar figure, was ultimately accepted by the board of directors of RJR Nabisco. At $31.1 billion of transaction value, RJR Nabisco was the largest leveraged buyout in history until the 2007 buyout of TXU Energy by KKR and Texas Pacific Group. In 2006 and 2007, a number of leveraged buyout transactions were completed that for the first time surpassed the RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout in terms of nominal purchase price. However, adjusted for inflation, none of the leveraged buyouts of the 2006–2007 period surpassed RJR Nabisco.

By the end of the 1980s the excesses of the buyout market were beginning to show, with the bankruptcy of several large buyouts including Robert Campeau&#x27;s 1988 buyout of Federated Department Stores, the 1986 buyout of the Revco drug stores, Walter Industries, FEB Trucking and Eaton Leonard. Additionally, the RJR Nabisco deal was showing signs of strain, leading to a recapitalization in 1990 that involved the contribution of $1.7 billion of new equity from KKR.

Drexel Burnham Lambert was the investment bank most responsible for the boom in private equity during the 1980s due to its leadership in the issuance of high-yield debt. Drexel reached an agreement with the government in which it pleaded &quot;nolo contendere&quot; (no contest) to six felonies – three counts of stock parking and three counts of stock manipulation. It also agreed to pay a fine of $650 million – at the time, the largest fine ever levied under securities laws. Milken left the firm after his own indictment in March 1989. On February 13, 1990, after being advised by United States Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas F. Brady, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the New York Stock Exchange, and the Federal Reserve, Drexel Burnham Lambert officially filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

===Age of the mega-buyout===

The combination of decreasing interest rates, loosening lending standards, and regulatory changes for publicly traded companies (specifically the Sarbanes–Oxley Act) would set the stage for the largest boom the private equity industry had seen. Marked by the buyout of Dex Media in 2002, large multibillion-dollar U.S. buyouts could once again obtain significant high yield debt financing from various banks and larger transactions could be completed. By 2004 and 2005, major buyouts were once again becoming common, including the acquisitions of Toys &quot;R&quot; Us, The Hertz Corporation, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and SunGard in 2005.

As 2005 ended and 2006 began, new &quot;largest buyout&quot; records were set and surpassed several times with nine of the top ten buyouts at the end of 2007 having been announced in an 18-month window from the beginning of 2006 through the middle of 2007. In 2006, private-equity firms bought 654 U.S. companies for $375 billion, representing 18 times the level of transactions closed in 2003. Additionally, U.S.-based private-equity firms raised $215.4 billion in investor commitments to 322 funds, surpassing the previous record set in 2000 by 22% and 33% higher than the 2005 fundraising total. The following year, despite the onset of turmoil in the credit markets in the summer, saw yet another record year of fundraising with $302 billion of investor commitments to 415 funds. Among the mega-buyouts completed during the 2006 to 2007 boom were: EQ Office, HCA, Alliance Boots and TXU.

In July 2007, turmoil that had been affecting the mortgage markets spilled over into the leveraged finance and high-yield debt markets. The markets had been highly robust during the first six months of 2007, with highly issuer friendly developments including PIK and PIK Toggle (interest is &quot;&quot;P&quot;ayable &quot;I&quot;n &quot;K&quot;ind&quot;) and covenant light debt widely available to finance large leveraged buyouts. July and August saw a notable slowdown in issuance levels in the high yield and leveraged loan markets with only few issuers accessing the market. Uncertain market conditions led to a significant widening of yield spreads, which coupled with the typical summer slowdown led many companies and investment banks to put their plans to issue debt on hold until the autumn. However, the expected rebound in the market after Labor Day 2007 did not materialize and the lack of market confidence prevented deals from pricing. By the end of September, the full extent of the credit situation became obvious as major lenders including Citigroup and UBS AG announced major writedowns due to credit losses. The leveraged finance markets came to a near standstill. As 2007 ended and 2008 began, it was clear that lending standards had tightened and the era of &quot;mega-buyouts&quot; had come to an end. Nevertheless, private equity continues to be a large and active asset class and the private-equity firms, with hundreds of billions of dollars of committed capital from investors are looking to deploy capital in new and different transactions.
===Failures===
As with all companies, a proportion of companies acquired in leveraged buyouts will experience financial challenges and given the higher debt-to-equity ratio of LBO targets, these financial challenges can result in default.

Especially in the leveraged buyouts of the 1980s in which debt-to-equity ratios often exceeded 9 to 1, defaults occurred at notable levels. Robert Campeau&#x27;s 1988 buyout of Federated Department Stores and the 1986 buyout of the Revco drug stores were well documented failures that resulted in bankruptcy. The failure of the Federated buyout was a result of excessive debt financing, comprising about 97% of the total consideration, which led to large interest payments that exceeded the company&#x27;s operating cash flow. Many LBOs of the boom period 2005–2007 were also financed with too high a debt burden, however default rates were significantly below the expectations of market observers given the proximate onset of the 2008 global financial crisis.
The inability to repay debt in an LBO can be caused by initial overpricing of the target firm and/or its assets. Over-optimistic forecasts of the revenues of the target company may also lead to financial distress after acquisition. Some courts have found that in certain situations, LBO debt constitutes a fraudulent transfer under U.S. insolvency law if it is determined to be the cause of the acquired firm&#x27;s failure. The outcome of litigation attacking a leveraged buyout as a fraudulent transfer will generally turn on the financial condition of the target at the time of the transaction – that is, whether the risk of failure was substantial and known at the time of the LBO, or whether subsequent unforeseeable events led to the failure. The analysis historically depended on &quot;dueling&quot; expert witnesses and was notoriously subjective and it was rare that such findings were sustained. In addition, the Bankruptcy Code includes a so-called &quot;safe harbor&quot; provision, preventing bankruptcy trustees from recovering settlement payments to the bought-out shareholders. In 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit held that such settlement payments could not be avoided, irrespective of whether they occurred in an LBO of a public or private company. To the extent that public shareholders are protected, insiders and secured lenders become the primary targets of fraudulent transfer actions.

In certain cases, instead of declaring insolvency, the company negotiates a debt restructuring with its lenders. The financial restructuring might entail that the equity owners inject some more money in the company and the lenders waive parts of their claims. In other situations, the lenders inject new money and assume the equity of the company, with the present equity owners losing their shares and investment. The operations of the company are not affected by the financial restructuring. Nonetheless, the financial restructuring requires significant management attention and may lead to customers losing faith in the company.

<doc id="58837" wikidata="Q3110404" url="?curid=58837" title="Zoutpansberg">
<text>Zoutpansberg was the north-eastern division of the Transvaal, South Africa, encompassing an area of 25,654 square miles. The chief towns at the time were Pietersburg and Leydsdorp. It was divided into two districts (west and east) prior to the first general election of the Union of South Africa in 1910. Since 2005 the area is divided into the Capricorn, Vhembe and Mopani district municipalities of Limpopo province.

==Voortrekkers==
This was the district to which Louis Tregardt and Hans van Rensburg, the forerunners of the Great Trek, journeyed in 1835. In 1845 Hendrik Potgieter, a prominent leader of the Voortrekkers, moved there. The Zoutpansberg Boers formed a semi-independent community, and in 1857 Stephanus Schoeman, their commandant-general, sided against Marthinus Pretorius and Paul Kruger when they invaded the Orange Free State.

==South African Republic==
It was not until 1864 that Zoutpansberg was definitively incorporated in the South African Republic as a result of the Transvaal Civil War. The white settlers in Zoutpansberg had for many years a reputation for lawlessness, and were later regarded as typical &quot;back velt Boers&quot;.

==Native population==
Zoutpansberg contained a larger native population than any other region of the Transvaal. It was estimated at 201,539 in 1903.

==Minerals==

Tregardt and his companions had been shown gold workings by the natives, and it was in this district in 1867–70, and in the neighbouring region of Lydenburg, that gold mines were first worked by Europeans south of the Limpopo. It is a highly mineralized area; next to gold, copper, found near the Limpopo River (where the Messina mine is located) is also extracted here.

<text>In finance, default is failure to meet the legal obligations (or conditions) of a loan, for example when a home buyer fails to make a mortgage payment, or when a corporation or government fails to pay a bond which has reached maturity. A national or sovereign default is the failure or refusal of a government to repay its national debt.

The biggest private default in history is Lehman Brothers, with over $600 billion when it filed for bankruptcy in 2008 (equivalent to over $ billion in ). The biggest sovereign default is Greece, with $138 billion in March 2012 (equivalent to $ billion in ).

==Distinction from insolvency, illiquidity and bankruptcy==
The term &quot;default&quot; should be distinguished from the terms &quot;insolvency&quot;, illiquidity and &quot;bankruptcy&quot;:
* Default: Debtors have been passed behind the payment deadline on a debt whose payment was due.
* Illiquidity: Debtors have insufficient cash (or other &quot;liquefiable&quot; assets) to pay debts.
* Insolvency: A legal term meaning debtors are unable to pay their debts.
* Bankruptcy: A legal finding that imposes court supervision over the financial affairs of those who are insolvent or in default.

==Types==

Default can be of two types: debt services default and technical default. Debt service default occurs when the borrower has not made a scheduled payment of interest or principal. Technical default occurs when an affirmative or a negative covenant is violated.

Affirmative covenants are clauses in debt contracts that require firms to maintain certain levels of capital or financial ratios. The most commonly violated restrictions in affirmative covenants are tangible net worth, working capital/short term liquidity, and debt service coverage.

Negative covenants are clauses in debt contracts that limit or prohibit corporate actions (e.g. sale of assets, payment of dividends) that could impair the position of creditors. Negative covenants may be continuous or incurrence-based. Violations of negative covenants are rare compared to violations of affirmative covenants.

With most debt (including corporate debt, mortgages and bank loans) a covenant is included in the debt contract which states that the total amount owed becomes immediately payable on the first instance of a default of payment. Generally, if the debtor defaults on any debt to the lender, a cross default covenant in the debt contract states that that particular debt is also in default.

In corporate finance, upon an uncured default, the holders of the debt will usually initiate proceedings (file a petition of involuntary bankruptcy) to foreclose on any collateral securing the debt. Even if the debt is not secured by collateral, debt holders may still sue for bankruptcy, to ensure that the corporation&#x27;s assets are used to repay the debt.

There are several financial models for analyzing default risk, such as the Jarrow-Turnbull model, Edward Altman&#x27;s Z-score model, or the structural model of default by Robert C. Merton (Merton Model).

===Sovereign defaults===

Sovereign borrowers such as nation-states generally are not subject to bankruptcy courts in their own jurisdiction, and thus may be able to default without legal consequences. One example is Greece, which defaulted on an IMF loan in 2015. In such cases, the defaulting country and the creditor are more likely to renegotiate the interest rate, length of the loan, or the principal payments.
In the 1998 Russian financial crisis, Russia defaulted on its internal debt (GKOs), but did not default on its external Eurobonds. As part of the Argentine economic crisis in 2002, Argentina defaulted on $1 billion of debt owed to the World Bank.

===Orderly default===
In times of acute insolvency crises, it can be advisable for regulators and lenders to preemptively engineer the methodic restructuring of a nation&#x27;s public debt—also called &quot;orderly default&quot; or &quot;controlled default&quot;. Experts who favor this approach to solve a national debt crisis typically argue that a delay in organising an orderly default would wind up hurting lenders and neighboring countries even more.

===Strategic default===

When a debtor &quot;chooses&quot; to default on a loan, despite being able to service it (make payments), this is said to be a strategic default. This is most commonly done for nonrecourse loans, where the creditor cannot make other claims on the debtor; a common example is a situation of negative equity on a mortgage loan in common law jurisdictions such as the United States, which is in general non-recourse. In this latter case, default is colloquially called &quot;jingle mail&quot;—the debtor stops making payments and mails the keys to the creditor, generally a bank.

===Sovereign strategic default===

Sovereign borrowers such as nation-states can also choose to default on a loan, even if they are capable of making the payments. In 2008, Ecuador&#x27;s president Rafael Correa strategically defaulted on a national debt interest payment, stating that he considered the debt &quot;immoral and illegitimate&quot;.

==Consumer default==

Consumer default frequently occurs in rent or mortgage payments, consumer credit, or utility payments. A European Union wide analysis identified certain risk groups, such as single households, being unemployed (even after correcting for the significant impact of having a low income), being young (especially being younger than around 50 years old, with somewhat different results for the New Member States, where the elderly were more often at risk as well), being unable to rely on social networks, etc. Even internet illiteracy has been associated with increased default, potentially caused by these households being less likely to find their way to the social benefits they are often entitled to. While effective non-legal debt counseling is usually the preferred -more economic and less disruptive- option, consumer default can end-up in legal debt settlement or consumer bankruptcy procedures, the last ranging from one-year procedures in the UK to six-year procedures in Germany.

Research in the United States has found that pre-purchase counseling can significantly reduce the rate of defaults.

<text>Richard Zouch (1 March 1661) was an English judge and a Member of Parliament from 1621 to 1624. He was elected Member of Parliament for Hythe in 1621 and later became principal of St. Alban Hall, Oxford. During the English Civil War, he was a Royalist and was appointed by Oliver Cromwell to a special commission of oyer and terminer. Zouch wrote extensive legal texts and was among the earliest systematic writers of international law.

== Early life ==
Zouch was born at Ansty, Wiltshire, the third surviving son of Francis Zouche (d.1600) and Philippa, sixth daughter of George Ludlow of Hill Deverel, Wiltshire. He was educated at Winchester and afterwards at New College, Oxford, where he was a scholar in 1607, and Fellow in 1609. He graduated as B.C.L. in 1614, and D.C.L. in 1619, was admitted at Doctor&#x27;s Commons, London, in January 1618, and was appointed Regius Professor of Civil Law at Oxford in 1620. In addition to his university duties, he had a large legal practice in London.

It was apparently in 1622 that he married Sarah, daughter of John Harte of Brill in Oxfordshire, a proctor in Doctors&#x27; Commons; having thus vacated his fellowship, he entered himself in 1623 as a fellow commoner at Wadham College.

== Career ==
In 1621 and 1624, through the influence of his cousin Edward la Zouche, 11th Baron Zouche, he was elected member of parliament for Hythe. In 1625 he became principal of St Alban Hall, Oxford.

He took a leading part in William Laud&#x27;s codification of the statutes of the university (1629–1633). He acted for many years as assessor of the vice-chancellor&#x27;s court, and in 1632 became chancellor of the diocese of Oxford. In 1641 he was made Judge of the High Court of Admiralty.

During the Civil War, he was a Royalist, though not a pronounced one. Under the Commonwealth, having submitted to the parliamentary visitors, he retained his university appointments, and was appointed by Oliver Cromwell to a special commission of oyer and terminer (consisting of three judges, three civilians, and three laymen, for the trial of Don Pantaleone Sa, the brother of the Portuguese ambassador, for murder committed in a brawl). Zouche was, however, not allowed to retain the judgeship of the admiralty, which was in 1649 conferred on John Exton. He was regarded with some suspicion by both factions.

After the Restoration, he was appointed to the commission which reinstated the professors and Fellows of Oxford who had been removed under the Protectorate of Cromwell. On 4 February 1661, he was restored to his judgeship, though he died soon afterwards at his apartments in Doctors&#x27; Commons, London, on 1 March 1661.

==Publications==

===Legal works===
*&quot;Elementa jurisprudentiae&quot; (1629)
*&quot;Descriptio juris et judicii feudalis, secundum consuetudines Mediolani et Normanniae, pro introductione ad juris prudentiam Anglicanam&quot; (1634)

*&quot;Juris et judicii fecialis sive juris inter gentes ... explicatio&quot; (1650)
*&quot;Solutio quaestionis de legati delinquentis judice competente&quot; (1657)

In virtue of the last two he has the distinction of being one of the earliest systematic writers on international law. According to Thomas Erskine Holland writing in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s coinage &quot;international law&quot; derives from the phrase &quot;jus inter gentes&quot; implied by Zouch&#x27;s 1650 choice of title. Holland also identifies both Zouch and Arthur Duck as pupils of distinction of the civilian John Budden, in the Oxford tradition founded by Alberico Gentili.

<doc id="58843" wikidata="Q13638325" url="?curid=58843" title="Zouave">
<text>The Zouaves () were a class of light infantry regiments of the French Army and other units modelled on it, which served between 1830 and 1962, and served in French North Africa. The zouaves were among the most decorated units of the French Army.

It was initially intended that the zouaves would be a regiment of Berber volunteers from the Zwawa group of tribes in Algeria (&quot;Zwawa&quot; being the origin of the French term &quot;&quot;) who had gained a martial reputation fighting for local rulers under the Regency of Algiers. The regiment was to consist of 1,600 Zwawa Berbers, French non-commissioned officers and French officers. 500 Zwawa were recruited in August and September 1830. However, twelve years later, this idea was dropped. More zouave regiments were raised and the men recruited to serve in them were almost exclusively French or people of French descent born in French Algeria (&quot;pieds-noirs&quot;), a policy which continued until the final dissolution of these regiments after the Algerian War.

In the 1860s, zouave units arose in many other countries. The Papal Zouaves were organized by Louis Juchault de Lamoricière, a former commander of North African zouaves, while a former zouave sergeant, François Rochebrune, organized the Polish Zouaves of Death who fought against Russia in the January Uprising of 1863–1864. In the 1870s, former Papal Zouaves formed the cadre for a short-lived Spanish zouave unit. The &quot;zouave&quot; title was also used by Brazilian units of black volunteers in the Paraguayan War, possibly due to a perceived link with Africa.

In the United States, zouaves were brought to public attention by Elmer E. Ellsworth, who created and ran a drill company called the &quot;Zouave Cadets&quot;. The drill company toured nationally. Zouave units were then raised on both sides of the American Civil War of 1861–1865; including a regiment under Ellsworth&#x27;s command, the 11th New York Infantry—the New York &quot;Fire Zouaves&quot;.

The distinctive uniforms of French and other zouave units was of North African origin. It generally included short open-fronted jackets, baggy trousers (&quot;serouel&quot;), sashes, and a fez-like &quot;chéchia&quot; head-dress.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;zouave&quot; () is a French language derivative of &quot;Zouaouas&quot;; the original name of the Kabyle Berbers recruited for French service.

==Zouave units in French service==
===Recruitment===
The zouaves of the French Army were first raised in Algeria in 1831 with one and later two battalions, initially recruited primarily from the Zouaoua (or Zwāwa), a tribe of Berbers located in the mountains of the Jurjura Range (see Kabyles). The Zouaoua had formerly provided soldiers for the deys of Algiers and in August 1830 the commander of the French expeditionary force which had occupied the city recommended their continued employment in this role. The existence of the new corps was formally recognised by a Royal decree dated 21 March 1831.
From their beginning the zouave units included a French European element, initially drawn from the demobilized &quot;Garde royal&quot; of Charles X and other Parisian volunteers. From March 1833 each zouave battalion was organised into ten companies, of which eight were Muslim Berbers and Arabs and two French. In 1838 a third battalion was raised, and the regiment thus formed was commanded by Major de Lamoriciere. Shortly afterwards the formation of the &quot;Tirailleurs algériens&quot;, the &quot;Turcos&quot;, as the infantry corps for Muslim troops, changed the basis for enlistment of the zouave battalions. For most of their remaining history the zouaves became an essentially French body, until in 1956 a new policy of partial racial mixing was introduced amongst units of the Army of Africa.

===Zouave regiments===
Initially constituted as battalion sized units, the zouaves were reorganized as separate regiments in 1852:

*The 1st Zouaves were linked to Algiers and central Algeria. The 1st Zouaves had a continuous existence from 1852 to 1949. After disbandment the regiment was recreated between 1956 and 1960
*The 2nd Zouaves were linked to Oran and western Algeria, 1852–1962
*The 3rd Zouaves were linked to Constantine and eastern Algeria, 1852–1962
*The 4th Zouaves were linked to Tunis and Tunisia. They were first formed as the Zouaves of the Imperial Guard in 1854, and became the 4th Zouves on the establishment of the Third Republic in 1870. They remained in existence under this title until 1962.

At the end of the Algerian War six zouave regiments were in existence, of which the &quot;1er&quot; was disbanded in 1960 and the remainder in 1962.

Other provisional regiments of zouaves were raised in 1914 and 1939 for the First and Second World Wars respectively. During World War I nine &quot;regiments de marche&quot; of zouaves were created; comprising active, reserve, and new battalions seconded from other regiments. In World War II the number reached fourteen.

The zouave regiments raised in 1914 for the First World War were the 8th and 9th. The 13th Zouaves were raised in 1919 and dissolved in 1940. The zouave regiments raised in 1939 for the Second World War were the 11th, 12th, 14th, and 21st, all of which were dissolved after the fall of France in 1940. Other regiments raised later in the Second World War were the 9th (&#x27;reactivated&#x27;), 22nd, 23rd, and 29th.
In addition, four mixed zouave and &quot;tirailleur&quot; regiments (&quot;régiments mixtes de zouaves et tirailleurs&quot;) were raised for the First World War, all of which were redesignated Algerian &quot;tirailleur&quot; regiments in 1918 or 1920.

The 9th Zouaves were the last French zouave unit. The first 9th Zouave regiment existed from 1914 until the fall of France in 1940, a second 9th Zouaves was raised in the Second World War and disbanded after the Algerian War (1954–1962), and a third 9th Zouaves existed as a nominal unit from 1982 to 2006 (representing a commando training school). There was no zouave regiment in existence between 1962–1982 and none now survive in the French Army.

===Early history===
The zouaves saw extensive service during the French conquest of Algeria, initially at the Mouzaia Pass action (March 1836), then at Mitidja (September 1836) and the siege of Constantine (1837). From 1843-44 either one or two battalions played prominent roles in each of the Kabylia campaigns.
Recruited through direct voluntary enlistment or by transfer from other regiments of men with at least two years service, the zouaves quickly achieved the status of an elite amongst the French Army of Africa.

===The Second Empire===
By 1853, the French Army included three regiments of zouaves. Each of the three line regiments of zouaves was allocated to a different province of Algeria, where their depots and peace-time garrisons were located. The Crimean War was the first service which the regiments saw outside Algeria. Armed with the powerful &quot;fusil rayé&quot; (rifled gun) they subsequently served as effective light infantry in the Franco-Austrian War of 1859, the Mexican Intervention (1864–1866) and the Franco-Prussian War (1870). In 1860 1,500 zouaves were landed in Beirut to assist in the restoration of order in the Levant, following extensive inter-communal disturbances.

The distinctive dress and dash of the zouaves made them well known outside France and they were frequently portrayed in the illustrated publications of the period. The 2nd Zouaves (popularly known as &quot;the Jackals of Oran&quot;) had their mutilated eagle decorated with the &quot;Legion d&#x27; Honneur&quot; following the Battle of Magenta in 1859.

On 23 December 1854 a fourth regiment was created, the Zouaves of the Imperial Guard. The actual formation of this unit was delayed until 15 March 1855 when detachments from the zouave regiments already serving in the Crimea were brought together before Sebastopol for this purpose. Having earned the unusual distinction of being created on the field of battle, the Zouaves of the Imperial Guard served through the remainder of the Crimean War and subsequently in all the campaigns of the Second Empire. Their peace-time garrisons were initially at Saint-Cloud and then Versailles from 1857. This regiment wore the classic zouave uniform but with yellow braiding and piping substituted for the red of the line regiments.

In the opening stages of the Franco-Prussian War the bulk of the serving zouave units were amongst the Imperial field army defeated at Sedan in September 1870. Drawing on remnants of the Imperial forces, depot troops from Algeria and volunteers it was possible to reconstitute all four regiments as part of the Army of the Loire and the Republican defenders of Paris.

===The Third Republic===
After 1871 the zouaves lost their status as an élite corps solely made up of long-service volunteers; they became a force mainly composed of conscripts from the French settlers in Algeria and Tunisia, undertaking their compulsory military service. Shortfalls in numbers were made up by detachments from the Paris, Lyon and some northern &quot;régions militaires&quot; of mainland France (&quot;Métropole&quot;). The zouave regiments did however retain significant numbers of long-service volunteers (&quot;engages volontiers et réengages&quot;) who contributed to the high morale and steadiness of these units.

Two zouave battalions (under &quot;chefs de bataillon&quot; Simon and Mignot) served in Tonkin during the closing weeks of the Sino-French War (August 1884 to April 1885). One of these battalions was roughly handled on 23 March 1885 in the Battle of Phu Lam Tao. A third zouave battalion (&quot;chef de bataillon&quot; Metzinger) joined the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps shortly after the end of the war, and took part in operations against Vietnamese insurgents.

In 1899 a law created for each regiment of zouaves a 5th Battalion, &quot;to be stationed in France&quot; in &quot;groupes des 5e bataillons de Zouaves&quot;. The 5th battalions of the 1st and 4th Zouaves were stationed as part of the &quot;Gouvernement militaire de Paris&quot;. The 5th battalions of the 2nd and 3rd Zouaves were stationed in the &quot;région militaire de Lyon&quot;. Upon mobilization for war in France, these battalions would form the nucleus of &quot;Régiments de Marche de Zouaves&quot;, each of 3 battalions. This permanent presence in the two key garrisons of metropolitan France facilitated subsequent arrival and participation by other elements of the 19th Military Region as reinforcements, in the event of an attack on mainland France.

Zouave battalions subsequently saw active service in China during the Boxer Rising (1900–1901) and in Morocco (1908–1914). From the very beginning of World War I zouave regiments and detached battalions saw extensive service on the Western Front. Others served in the Dardanelles, Macedonia (within the 156th Division), Tonkin, Algeria, Tunisia, and Morocco. Twelve zouave battalions were recruited for exclusively North African service from French-speaking prisoners-of-war and deserters from German Alsace-Lorraine, who had volunteered to join the French Army.

The four zouave regiments of the French Army wore their traditional colorful dress during the early months of the First World War. The development of the machine gun, rapid-fire artillery, and improved small-arms obliged them to adopt a plain khaki uniform from 1915 onwards, in common with other units of the &quot;Armée d&#x27;Afrique&quot;. From 1927 to 1939 the &quot;oriental dress&quot; of red fez (&quot;chéchia&quot;), blue sash, braided blue jackets with waistcoats and voluminous red trousers was reintroduced as off-duty dress for re-enlisted NCOs and other long-service regulars in the zouave regiments.
It was also worn by colour guards and other detachments on ceremonial occasions. White trousers of the same style had earlier been worn as an item of hot-weather dress. The four regiments were distinguished by the colours (red, blue, white and yellow) of the &quot;tombeaus&quot; or false pockets on the front of their open-fronted jackets.

The zouaves played a major role in the 1914–1918 War with their numbers being expanded to nine &quot;regiments de marche&quot;. These units retained much of their traditional panache, especially in attack. They became however less conspicuous in World War II, seeing service mainly during the opening stages of the war in the Battle of France (1940) and in the course of the liberation of France (1944).

===Post-1945===
As predominantly conscript units the zouaves did not serve in Indochina between 1945 and 1954. They were, however, employed extensively as sector troops during the Algerian War. Their history as a corps of high-profile elite infantry, closely identified with French Algeria, made for higher morale and effectiveness than that of most conscript units from metropolitan France assigned to Algeria. The 9th Zouaves based in the Casbah, played a major role in the 1957 Battle of Algiers.

At the end of the Algerian War, the remaining zouave and tirailleur units were incorporated in a short-lived &quot;Force locale de l&#x27;ordre Algérienne&quot;: created under the Évian Accords of March 1962 and intended to provide a transitional peace-keeping force acceptable to both Muslim and European communities. The remaining zouave regiments (2nd, 3rd, 4th, 8th and 9th) were finally disbanded in 1962 immediately following Algerian independence. This was inevitable since their recruitment base was the European population of Algeria, which dispersed with the ending of French rule.

The traditions of the zouave regiments were maintained until 2006 by the French Army&#x27;s Commando Training School of Givet (&quot;Centre d&#x27;entrainment commando&quot;), which occasionally paraded colour parties and other detachments in zouave dress. With the closure of the CEC school that year and the putting into store of the flag of the 9th Zouaves in 2010, any direct link between the former zouaves and active units of the modern French Army ceased. While other branches of the old French Army of Africa have either survived or been reestablished as representative units in recent years (notably the Foreign Legion, Chasseurs d&#x27;Afrique, Tirailleurs, and Spahis), France has not recreated one of its most distinctive and best known military corps.

==Zouave units in Papal service==

The Papal Zouaves were a corps of volunteers formed as part of the Army of the Papal States. The Zouaves evolved out of a unit formed by Lamoricière in 1860: the Franco-Belgian Tirailleurs. On January 1, 1861, the unit was renamed the Papal Zouaves.

The &quot;Zuavi Pontifici&quot; were mainly young men, unmarried and Roman Catholic, who volunteered to assist Pope Pius IX in his struggle against the Italian Risorgimento. They wore a similar style of uniform to that of the French Zouaves but in grey with red trim. A grey and red kepi was substituted for the North African fez.

All orders were given in French, and the unit was commanded by a Swiss Colonel, M. Allet. The regiment was truly international, and by May 1868 numbered 4,592 men including 1,910 Dutch, 1,301 French, 686 Belgians, and 240 Italians. A total of three hundred volunteers came from Canada, the United States and Ireland; while the remaining 155 Zouaves were mostly South American.

The Papal Zouaves assisted in the notable Franco/Papal victory at the Battle of Mentana on November 3, 1867. They suffered the brunt of the fighting, sustaining 81 casualties in the battle, including 24 killed (the Papal forces suffered only 30 dead in total). The official report of the battle prepared by the French commander, General de Failly cited the bravery of the Zouaves. They were also mentioned in Victor Hugo&#x27;s poem &quot;Mentana&quot;.

The Papal Zouaves also played a role in the final engagements against the forces of the newly united Kingdom of Italy in September 1870, in which the Papal forces were outnumbered almost seven to one. The Zouaves fought bravely before surrender, inflicting losses on the Bersaglieri of the regular Italian Army as the latter stormed the Porta Pia.
Several Papal Zouaves were reportedly executed or murdered by the Italian forces following the surrender.

The French component of the Papal Zouaves regrouped as the &quot;Volontaires de l&#x27;Ouest&quot; (Volunteers of the West) to fight on the French side in the Franco-Prussian War, where they kept their grey and red Papal uniforms. The Zouaves saw action outside Orléans, Patay and the Battle of Loigny. The &quot;Volontaires de l&#x27;Ouest&quot; were disbanded after the entrance of Prussian troops into Paris.

In 1871 an English veteran, Joseph Powell, published his account of his service with the Papal Zouaves, &quot;Two Years in the Pontifical Zouaves.&quot;

==Zouave units in Polish service==

In 1863, during the Polish January Uprising against the Russian Empire, a French ex-officer who had served previously in one of the French zouave regiments, François Rochebrune, organised the &quot;Zouaves of Death&quot;. Members of this Polish unit swore &quot;to conquer or to die&quot; and not to surrender. They wore a black uniform with white cross and red fez.

The unit&#x27;s baptism by fire occurred at the Battle of Miechów, where under the command of adjutant Wojciech Komorowski, they successfully charged Russian forces defending the local cemetery. However, the overall engagement was a defeat for the Poles on February 17, 1863. Lt. Tytus O&#x27;Brien de Lacy escaped with 400 zouaves to Galicia in March 1863. In the Battle of Chroberz the Zouaves covered the retreat of the main body of Polish forces under Marian Langiewicz. They also fought at the follow-up Battle of Grochowiska where they captured Russian artillery positions but suffered very high casualties.

Commanding officers of the regiment were:
* Colonel François Rochebrune;
* Lieutenant Count Wojciech Komorowski;
* Lieutenant Tytus O&#x27;Brien de Lacy;
* Lieutenant Antoni Wojcicki; and
* Lieutenant Tenente Bella

==Zouave units in British service==
In 1856, the West India Regiments of the British Army switched their attire to a uniform modeled on that of the French zouaves. This consisted of a red fez with a white tassel, a white turban, a scarlet sleeveless jacket with yellow trimming, a white long sleeved waistcoat, and dark blue sirwals with yellow piping. White canvas gaiters and leather jamberees completed the uniform. This uniform was reserved for full dress and is still used by the Barbados Defense Force military band and the Jamaica Military Band. Other British colonial units who adopted zouave elements as part of their dress uniforms included the Gold Coast Regiment and the Royal West African Frontier Force.

==Zouave units in American service==

===American Civil War===
====Union Zouaves====

Numerous zouave regiments were organized from soldiers of the United States of America who adopted the name and the North African–inspired uniforms during the American Civil War. The Union army had more than 70 volunteer zouave regiments throughout the conflict, while the Confederates fielded about 25 Zouave companies.

In the United States, zouaves were brought to public attention by Elmer E. Ellsworth. Inspired by his French friend Charles De Villers, who had been a surgeon in the North African zouaves, he obtained a zouave drill manual. In 1859, Ellsworth took over a drill company and renamed them the &quot;Zouave Cadets&quot;. The drill company toured nationally, performing the light infantry drill of the north African zouaves with many theatrical additions. &quot;Zouave&quot; units were then raised on both sides of the American Civil War of 1861–1865, including a regiment under Ellsworth&#x27;s command, the New York &quot;Fire Zouaves&quot;.

A feature of some American zouave units, at least in the opening stages of the American Civil War, was the light infantry tactics and drill they employed. Zouaves &quot;utilised light infantry tactics that emphasised open-order formations, with several feet between soldiers, rather than the customary close order, with its characteristic &#x27;touch of elbows&#x27;. They moved at double-time, rather than marching to a stately cadence, and they lay on their backs to load their rifles rather than standing to do so. To fire, they rolled prone and sometimes rose on one knee.&quot;

Arguably the most famous Union zouave regiments were from New York and Pennsylvania: the 5th New York Volunteer Infantry, known as &quot;Duryee&#x27;s Zouaves&quot; after its first colonel, Abram Duryee; the 114th Pennsylvania Infantry, called &quot;Collis&#x27;s Zouaves&quot; after their colonel, Charles H. T. Collis; and the 11th New York Volunteer Infantry, the &quot;Fire Zouaves&quot;. The 11th New York was initially led by Col. Elmer E. Ellsworth, until his death in 1861. The 11th New York was badly mauled during the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861 as it acted as the rear guard for the retreating Army of the Potomac. The 5th New York was considered one of the elite units of the Army of the Potomac; it was one of only two volunteer regiments serving with the regular division commanded by George Sykes. At the Second Battle of Bull Run, the 5th New York, along with another Zouave regiment, the 10th New York &quot;National Zouaves&quot;, held off the flanking attack of James Longstreet&#x27;s Corps for ten crucial minutes before it was overrun. The 5th New York thus suffered the highest percentage of casualties in the shortest amount of time of any unit in the Civil War – of 525 men, approximately 120 were killed and 330 were wounded in less than 10 minutes.
In 1863 and 1864, three Union regiments (146th New York, 140th New York, and 155th Pennsylvania) were issued with Zouave uniforms to reward their proficiency in drill and battlefield performance. Difficulties in supply and replacement meant that Zouave and other exotic militia uniforms tended to be replaced by standard issue uniforms throughout the conflict. However, the tradition remained strong, and the last Union casualty of the fighting in Virginia was reported to be a Zouave of the 155th Pennsylvania, killed at Farmville, Virginia, on the morning of April 9, 1865.

====Confederate Zouaves====
A number of Confederate Zouave units were also raised. In contrast to the many Federal units, most Confederate Zouaves were not full &quot;regiments&quot;; many were companies within larger units. The cognomen &quot;Louisiana Tiger&quot; dates from the Mexican–American War; it refers to any Louisiana state trooper (and more recently, to the state&#x27;s athletic teams). But none of the Mexican War Louisiana &quot;Tigers&quot; were Zouaves. The earliest, and most famous, Louisiana Zouave unit was White&#x27;s Company B (the &quot;Tiger Rifles&quot;) of Major Chatham Roberdeau Wheat&#x27;s 1st Special Battalion, Louisiana Volunteers, also known as &quot;Louisiana Tigers&quot;.

Another notable Zouave unit on the Confederate side was the &quot;1st (Coppens&#x27;) Louisiana Zouave Battalion&quot;, which was raised by Georges Augustus Gaston De Coppens in 1861. They saw action from the Peninsula Campaign to the Siege of Petersburg, all the while being short of supplies. They were disbanded in 1865.

The Confederate Zouave units did not last long throughout the war. All of them had traded out their Zouave garb for standard Confederate clothing by 1862. The last Confederate Zouave unit was Coppens&#x27; Zouave Battalion, which later became dubbed the Confederate State Zouave Battalion.

===Post-Civil War===
Zouaves gradually vanished from the U.S. military in the 1870s and 1880s, as the militia system slowly transformed into the National Guard. As an example, the Wisconsin militia still included one zouave unit in 1879, but the next year, in 1880, the traditional distinctions of title and dress ceased when a standard Wisconsin Guard uniform was adopted. After the Civil War, veteran groups sometimes dressed as zouaves during honor guard ceremonies such as funeral processions, since zouave dress was considered colorful and distinctive. Modern American Civil War reenactments often feature zouave units.

===American zouave uniforms===

The zouave uniform was sometimes quite elaborate, to the extent of being unwieldy. Some Zouave regiments wore a fez with a colored tassel (usually yellow, blue, green, or red) and turban, a tight fitting short jacket (some without buttons), a wide sash, baggy pantaloons or &quot;chasseur&quot; trousers, white leggings, and a short leather cuff for the calf, called jambieres. The sash was especially difficult to put on, often requiring the help of another zouave. The zouave uniform was better suited for warm climates and rough terrain. The loose pantaloons allowed for greater freedom of movement than trousers, while the short jacket was much cooler than the long woolen blouse worn by most armies of the time.

==Zouave units in Spanish service==

In the Third Carlist War (1872–1876) the Infante Alfonso Carlos, Duke of San Jaime, (the brother of the Carlist Pretender to the Spanish throne, Carlos, Duke of Madrid) raised a unit of Spanish zouaves, the Carlist Zouaves (&quot;Batallon Zuavos&quot;), as an honor guard for himself and his wife Maria de las Nieves Braganza. The Carlist Zouaves originated as the sixth company of the second battalion of the Pontifical Zouaves. (Don Alfonso Carlos had formerly served as a lieutenant in the Pontifical Zouaves.) The Carlist Zouaves had the status of an elite unit within the army of Catalonia and the Maestrazgo.

The uniforms of the Carlist Zouaves included the baggy trousers, short jacket, vest and sash of both the French and Pontifical Zouaves. However, the Carlist Zouaves also wore a distinctive feature that differentiated them from existing zouave regiments elsewhere, in the form of a beret of Basque influence with a characteristic tassel. In order to distinguish the troops from the officers, the color of the officer&#x27;s jacket was a blue-gray shade, with a darker blue for the other ranks. The beret worn by the troops was white with a yellow tassel, while the officers wore a red beret with yellow tassel. The baggy trousers were grayish for all ranks.

==Other zouave units==
* Between 1880 and 1908 the Turkish Imperial Guard included two zouave regiments. The Abdul Hamid II Collection in the US Library of Congress has a number of photographs of these soldiers. They wore a uniform similar to that of the French zouaves but with green turbans and less widely cut red breeches. The Ottoman Zouaves were disbanded following the Young Turks coup of 1908, when the Imperial Guard was reduced to a ceremonial palace unit.
* Under the Empire of Brazil, a battalion of black volunteers, called the &quot;Zuavos da Bahia&quot; (Bahian Zouaves) was organized in 1865. Although such use drew on a long tradition of black men&#x27;s service to the Brazilian monarchy and State, both government and army soon rejected such segregated units, scattering its men along other units.
* During his campaign of 1860 against the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, Giuseppe Garibaldi&#x27;s Redshirts included a volunteer battalion designated as the Calabrian Zouaves (&quot;Zuavvi Calabesi&quot;).
* In 1879, at the advent of the War of the Pacific, Peru&#x27;s Batallón “Zuavos” Nº10 was one of the units which took part in the coup d&#x27;etat which brought Nicolás de Piérola into power as the country&#x27;s &quot;Supreme Commander in Chief&quot;. Piérola immediately reorganized the army for the defense of the capital, and the Batallón “Zuavos” Nº29 de Línea was merged into the II Army Corps under the command of Colonel Belisario Suárez. It was later renamed Batallón “Zepita” Nº29, and as such took part in the Battle of San Juan and Chorrillos on 13 January 1881. Another Zouave unit which took part in the battle was the Batallón Nº1 de Zouavos de Lima.

==North African dress influence==
From 1830 to 1848 the zouave costume was closely derived from contemporary North African clothing. However, with the establishment of the zouave regiments as a permanent and integral part of the French Army, the &quot;oriental dress&quot; became a formalized uniform, subject to regulations while retaining the distinctive features of its indigenous origins.

Features of the zouave dress were widely copied by colonial units of various European armies during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These included African regiments raised by Portugal, Britain, Spain, and Italy, as well as the West India Regiment in British service.

Variations of zouave-style dress of the short open jacket (&quot;shama&quot;), voluminous trousers (&quot;serouel&quot;) and fez were worn by indigenous regiments of the French Army of Africa such as the Spahis and the &quot;Tirailleurs Algeriens&quot;, although in different colours.

Modern ceremonial units of the Algerian, Moroccan, and Tunisian armies retain items of traditional North African dress, sharing some common features with the &quot;tenue orientale&quot; of the French zouaves.

==In popular culture==
* In French vernacular speech, the phrase &quot;faire le Zouave&quot; can be translated as &quot;to act the goat&quot; i.e. to behave wildly. In this context &quot;zouave&quot; is used as an insult by Captain Haddock, a character in the Belgian comic &quot;The Adventures of Tintin&quot;. Professor Calculus takes particular offense at the insult in &quot;Destination Moon&quot; and at the conclusion of &quot;Explorers on the Moon&quot;.
* A tall statue of &quot;The Zouave&quot;, carved by Georges Diebolt in the 19th century to form part of the Alma Bridge across the Seine in Paris, serves as a widely watched means of gauging the level of the river. When water reaches a point between the knees and the waist of the &quot;Zouave of the Alma&quot;, flooding has historically been considered imminent and river traffic has been halted.
* In the film &quot;Gods and Generals&quot;, the 11th New York (Ellsworth&#x27;s Fire Zouaves) and the 14th Brooklyn (84th New York Infantry) are shown fighting the Stonewall Brigade at First Manassas.
* In the film &quot;Gettysburg&quot;, the 14th Brooklyn are shown during the first day of battle. The 114th Pennsylvania are also shown guarding the Headquarter staff as the Union set up defenses and the 72nd Pennsylvania are briefly shown during Picketts Charge and the epilogue. In the opening credits, a scene that shows three Zouaves of the 5th New York is used as a background.
* In the film &quot;Glory&quot;, the 14th Brooklyn is shown in the beginning and during the Battle of Antietam. The 14th Brooklyn is actually supposed to represent the Zouave d&#x27;Afrique – 114th Pennsylvanian, later known as Collis Zouaves – because the scene represents the assault on the Sunken Road. Zouaves can also be seen escorting General Strong&#x27;s party as it observes Fort Wagner. These Zouaves are probably supposed to represent the 76th Pennsylvania which was the only Zouave regiment in the tenth corp. However, the uniform on the Zouaves shown does not depict the actual uniform worn by the 76th.
* In the TV miniseries &quot;The Blue and the Gray&quot;, a group of Union Zouaves is shown fighting at the First Battle of Bull Run. These Zouaves are most likely supposed to represent the 11th New York First Fire Zouaves. However, just like the 14th Brooklyn in &quot;Gods and Generals&quot;, the Zouaves are shown fighting as part of a regiment instead of an individual regiment. The uniform that the zouaves wear is based on that shown in the Kurz and Alison lithograph of the battle. While both are most likely trying to represent the 11th New York (since it was the only true Zouave regiment present on the field), the uniform is inaccurate. At First Bull Run, the 11th wore red overshirts (most of them discarded the dark blue red trimmed zouave jackets prior to the battle), mid-blue sash, blue or red fez with a blue tassel, and leather gaiters.
* In Margaret Mitchell&#x27;s novel &quot;Gone With The Wind&quot;, a Zouave, Rene Picard, joins the Confederate Army of Tennessee in Atlanta, Georgia. Picard is remembered for his good humor, charm, and optimism; also, for his inveterate Creole French accent.
* In the 1955 Danny Kaye film &quot;The Court Jester&quot;, the Jackson Zouaves American Legion Drill Team from Jackson, Michigan, is seen performing a humorous drill routine using the traditional Zouave quick-march. The group also made several appearances, in full Zouave uniform, on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; between 1953 and 1960.
* In the 1960 Edward Gorey book &quot;The Fatal Lozenge&quot;, a Zouave is the subject of the final poem in Gorey&#x27;s alphabetical list. In the poem, the Zouave, used to killing after years of war, stabs a young child who has begun to prattle.
*In the Albert Camus book &quot;The First Man&quot; – published posthumously in 1994, but based on an incomplete manuscript the author was working on at the time of his death in 1960 – the protagonist&#x27;s father, Henri Cormery, serves as a Zouave. He dies following injuries sustained in battle during the First World War.
* The figure portrayed on the front of Zig-Zag rolling papers, colloquially known as the &quot;Zig-Zag man&quot;, originates from a folk story about a zouave in the battle of Sevastopol. When the soldier&#x27;s clay pipe was destroyed by a bullet, he attempted to roll his tobacco using a piece of paper torn from his bag of gunpowder.
* In the Buster Keaton film &quot;The Playhouse&quot;, a zouave drill routine is one of the acts at the theatre. One of the gags involves Keaton&#x27;s boss telling him to get him some Zouaves and Keaton first hands him a pack of cigarettes (referring to the above brand).

<text>Zosterops (meaning &quot;eye-girdle&quot;) is a genus of passerine birds containing the typical white-eyes in the white-eye family Zosteropidae. The genus has the largest number of species in the white-eye family. They occur in the Afrotropical, Indomalayan, and Australasian realms. Typical white-eyes have a length of between . Their most characteristic feature is a conspicuous white feather ring around the eye, though some species lack it. The species in this group vary in the structural adaptations of the tongue. The &quot;Zosterops&quot; [&quot;griseotinctus&quot;] group is an example of a &quot;great speciator&quot; inhabiting a vast area and showing a remarkable morphological differentiation on islands, some of which may be as close as apart.

==Systematics==
The genus &quot;Zosterops&quot; was introduced by the naturalists Nicholas Vigors and Thomas Horsfield in 1827. The name combines the Ancient Greek words &quot;zōstēros&quot; &quot;belt&quot; or &quot;girdle&quot; and &quot;ōpos&quot; &quot;eye&quot;. The type species was designated as the Malagasy white-eye by René Lesson in 1828.

The results of a series of molecular phylogenetic studies of the Zosteropidae published between 2014 and 2018 prompted a major revision of species limits, in which 10 new genera were introduced. In the reorganisation, the English names of three of the existing genera were replaced.

Additionally, a study on Sri Lanka white-eyes (&quot;Zosterops ceylonensis&quot;) and Indian white-eyes (&quot;Zosterops palpebrosus&quot;) suggests that the Sri Lanka white-eye is the root species and the origin of all &quot;Zosterops species&quot;. This raises questions upon the former theory of Southeast Asian origin.

<text>France is divided into eighteen administrative regions (, singular ), of which thirteen are located in metropolitan France (in Europe), while the other five are overseas regions (not to be confused with the overseas collectivities, which have a semi-autonomous status).

All of the thirteen metropolitan administrative regions (including Corsica ) are further subdivided into two to thirteen administrative departments, with the prefect of each region&#x27;s administrative centre&#x27;s department also acting as the regional prefect. The overseas regions administratively consist of only one department each and hence also have the status of overseas departments.

Most administrative regions also have the status of regional territorial collectivities, which comes with a local government, with departmental and communal collectivities below the regional level. The exceptions are Corsica, French Guiana, Mayotte and Martinique, where region and department functions are managed by single local governments having consolidated jurisdiction and which are known as single territorial collectivities.

== History ==
===1982–2015===
The term was officially created by the Law of Decentralisation (2 March 1982), which also gave regions their legal status. The first direct elections for regional representatives took place on 16 March 1986.

Between 1982 and 2015, there were 22 regions in Metropolitan France. Before 2011, there were four overseas regions (French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique, and Réunion); in 2011 Mayotte became the fifth.

===Reform and mergers of regions===
In 2014, the French parliament passed a law reducing the number of metropolitan regions from 22 to 13 effective 1 January 2016.

The law gave interim names for most of the new regions by combining the names of the former regions, e.g. the region composed of Aquitaine, Poitou-Charentes and Limousin was temporarily called &quot;Aquitaine-Limousin-Poitou-Charentes&quot;. However, the combined region of Upper and Lower Normandy was simply called &quot;Normandy&quot; (&quot;Normandie&quot;). Permanent names were proposed by the new regional councils by 1 July 2016 and new names confirmed by the by 30 September 2016. The legislation defining the new regions also allowed the Centre region to officially change its name to &quot;Centre-Val de Loire&quot; with effect from January 2015.
Two regions, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes and Bourgogne-Franche-Comté, opted to retain their interim names.

Given below is a table of former regions and which new region they became part of.

== List of administrative regions ==
== Role ==
Regions lack separate legislative authority and therefore cannot write their own statutory law. They levy their own taxes and, in return, receive a decreasing part of their budget from the central government, which gives them a portion of the taxes it levies. They also have considerable budgets managed by a regional council &quot;(conseil régional)&quot; made up of representatives voted into office in regional elections.

A region&#x27;s primary responsibility is to build and furnish high schools. In March 2004, the French central government unveiled a controversial plan to transfer regulation of certain categories of non-teaching school staff to the regional authorities. Critics of this plan contended that tax revenue was insufficient to pay for the resulting costs, and that such measures would increase regional inequalities.

In addition, regions have considerable discretionary power over infrastructural spending, e.g., education, public transit, universities and research, and assistance to business owners. This has meant that the heads of wealthy regions such as Île-de-France or Rhône-Alpes can be high-profile positions.

Proposals to give regions limited legislative autonomy have met with considerable resistance; others propose transferring certain powers from the departments to their respective regions, leaving the former with limited authority.

=== Regional control ===
Number of regions controlled by each coalition since 1986.

== Overseas regions ==
Overseas region () is a recent designation, given to the overseas departments that have similar powers to those of the regions of metropolitan France. As integral parts of the French Republic, they are represented in the National Assembly, Senate and Economic and Social Council, elect a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and use the euro as their currency.

Although these territories have had these political powers since 1982, when France&#x27;s decentralisation policy dictated that they be given elected regional councils along with other regional powers, the designation &quot;overseas regions&quot; dates only to the 2003 constitutional change; indeed, the new wording of the constitution aims to give no precedence to either appellation &quot;overseas department&quot; or &quot;overseas region&quot;, although the second is still virtually unused by French media.

The following have overseas region status:

* in the Indian Ocean (Africa):
** Mayotte 
** Réunion
* in the Americas:
** French Guiana in South America
** Guadeloupe in the Antilles (Caribbean)
** Martinique in the Antilles (Caribbean)

: ^ Saint Pierre and Miquelon (located just south of Newfoundland, Canada, in North America), once an overseas department, was demoted to a territorial collectivity in 1985.

<doc id="58848" wikidata="Q228968" url="?curid=58848" title="Fiona Apple">
<text>Fiona Apple McAfee-Maggart (born September 13, 1977) is an American singer-songwriter. Noted for her songwriting, she released five albums from 1996 to 2020, all of which reached the top 20 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. As of 2021, She has sold over 15 million records worldwide. Apple has received numerous awards and nominations, including three Grammy Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards, and a Billboard Music Award.

The youngest daughter of the actor Brandon Maggart, Apple was born in New York City and was raised alternating between her mother&#x27;s home in New York and her father&#x27;s in Los Angeles. Classically trained on piano as a child, she began composing her own songs when she was eight years old. Her debut album, &quot;Tidal&quot;, containing songs written when she was in her teens, was released in 1996 and received a Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance for the single &quot;Criminal&quot;. She followed with &quot;When the Pawn...&quot; (1999), produced by Jon Brion, which was also critically and commercially successful and was certified Platinum.

For her third album, &quot;Extraordinary Machine&quot; (2005), Apple again collaborated with Brion and began recording the album in 2002. However, Apple was reportedly unhappy with the production and opted not to release the record, leading fans to protest Epic Records, erroneously believing that the label was withholding its release. The album was eventually re-produced without Brion and released in October 2005. The album was certified Gold, and nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album. In 2012, she released her fourth studio album, &quot;The Idler Wheel...&quot;, which received critical praise and was followed by a tour of the United States and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 2013. Apple&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Fetch the Bolt Cutters&quot;, was released in 2020, earning two Grammy Awards: Best Alternative Music Album and Best Rock Performance for the lead single &quot;Shameika.&quot;

==Early life and education==
Fiona Apple was born Fiona Apple McAfee-Maggart on September 13, 1977, in New York City to singer Diane McAfee and actor Brandon Maggart, who met when both were cast in the Broadway musical &quot;Applause&quot;. Her father is from Tennessee, and through him, Apple has Melungeon ancestry. Her maternal grandparents were dancer Millicent Green and big band vocalist Johnny McAfee. Her sister Amber sings cabaret under the stage name Maude Maggart, and actor Garett Maggart is her half brother. Apple grew up in Morningside Gardens in Harlem with her mother and sister, but spent summers with her father in Los Angeles, California.

She attended the private Episcopal school St. Hilda&#x27;s &amp; St. Hugh&#x27;s School and later Alexander Hamilton High School (Los Angeles), as well as being homeschooled. Apple was classically trained on piano as a child, and began composing her own pieces by the age of eight. When learning to play piano, she would often take sheet music and translate guitar tablature into the corresponding notes. Apple later began to play along with jazz standard compositions after becoming proficient, through which she discovered Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald, who became major influences on her.

Since childhood, Apple has struggled with obsessive–compulsive disorder, depression, and anxiety, and has also been diagnosed with complex post-traumatic stress disorder. At age 12, she was raped outside the apartment she shared with her mother, step-father, and sister in Harlem. She subsequently developed an eating disorder, purposely slimming her developing body, which she saw as &quot;bait&quot; for potential predators. &quot;I definitely did have an eating disorder&quot;, she recalled. &quot;What was really frustrating for me was that everyone thought I was anorexic, and I wasn&#x27;t. I was just really depressed and self-loathing.&quot; She also described how her OCD developed into avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, requiring food to be a certain color or shape.

After the rape, Apple began attending Model Mugging classes, practicing self-defense, but continued to suffer panic attacks while walking home from school, which led to her relocating to Los Angeles to live with her father for one year. In Los Angeles, Apple attended Alexander Hamilton High School for her second year.

In a 2000 interview, Apple stated that, despite speculation from journalists, she did not write songs about the trauma surrounding her rape: &quot;It doesn&#x27;t get into the writing. It&#x27;s a boring pain. It&#x27;s such a fuckin&#x27; old pain that, you know, there&#x27;s nothing &quot;poetic&quot; about it.&quot;

==Career==
Apple was introduced to the music industry in 1994, when she gave a demo tape containing the songs &quot;Never Is a Promise&quot;, &quot;Not One of Those Times&quot;, and &quot;He Takes a Taxi&quot; to her friend who was the babysitter for music publicist Kathryn Schenker. Schenker then passed the tape along to Sony Music executive Andy Slater. Apple&#x27;s abilities captured his attention, and Slater signed her to a record deal.

===1996–2001: &quot;Tidal&quot; and &quot;When the Pawn...&quot;===
In 1996, Apple&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Tidal&quot;, was released by Work Records and Columbia Records. The record was largely inspired by Apple&#x27;s recent breakup with her first boyfriend. The album sold 2.7 million copies and was certified three times Platinum in the U.S. &quot;Criminal&quot;, the third single, became a hit and the song reached the Top 40 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The song&#x27;s controversial Mark Romanek-directed music video played on MTV. Other singles from &quot;Tidal&quot; included &quot;Shadowboxer&quot;, &quot;Sleep to Dream&quot;, and &quot;Never Is a Promise&quot;. Apple accepted the MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist at the 1997 MTV Video Music Awards for her song &quot;Sleep to Dream&quot;, during her acceptance speech she said:

Apple responded to criticisms of her acceptance speech in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in January 1998, stating, &quot;When I have something to say, I&#x27;ll say it.&quot; During this period, Apple also covered the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Across the Universe&quot; and Percy Mayfield&#x27;s &quot;Please Send Me Someone to Love&quot; for the soundtrack of the film &quot;Pleasantville&quot;. She later canceled the last 21 dates on a tour in support of her album due to &quot;personal family problems&quot;. In 1997, Apple met director Paul Thomas Anderson during a photoshoot, and the two began a relationship that lasted several years.

Apple&#x27;s second album, &quot;When the Pawn...&quot;, was released in 1999. Its full title is a poem Apple wrote after reading letters that appeared in &quot;Spin&quot; regarding an article that had cast her in a negative light in an earlier issue. The title&#x27;s length earned it a spot in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; for 2001. However, as of October 2007, it no longer has the longest album title, as Soulwax released &quot;Most of the Remixes&quot;, a remix album whose title surpasses &quot;When the Pawn&quot;″s length by 100 characters. &quot;When the Pawn&quot; was cultivated during Apple&#x27;s relationship with film director Paul Thomas Anderson. &quot;When the Pawn,&quot; which was produced by Jon Brion, used more expressive lyrics, experimented more with drum loops, and incorporated both the Chamberlin and drummer Matt Chamberlain. The album received a positive reception from publications such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. It did not fare as well commercially as her debut, though it was an RIAA-certified Platinum album and sold one million copies in the U.S. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Fast as You Can&quot;, reached the top twenty on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Modern Rock Tracks chart and became Apple&#x27;s first Top 40 hit in the UK. The videos for two follow-up singles, &quot;Paper Bag&quot; and &quot;Limp&quot; (directed by then-boyfriend Anderson), received very little play.

In a February 2000 set hampered by equipment issues to 3,000 audience members at the New York City Roseland Ballroom, a frustrated Apple left the stage without returning. Her performance saw Apple appearing distraught at the sound quality, apologizing numerous times for the sound and crying. After completing a concert tour in support of her second album in 2000, Apple relocated to Los Angeles, where she still resides as of 2020.

===2002–2010: &quot;Extraordinary Machine&quot; and release delays===
During her hiatus, Apple contemplated retiring from her recording career. Apple sang with Johnny Cash on a cover of Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;Bridge over Troubled Water&quot; that ended up on his album &quot;American IV: The Man Comes Around&quot; and was nominated for a Grammy Award for &quot;Best Country Collaboration with Vocals&quot;. She also collaborated with Cash on Cat Stevens&#x27;s &quot;Father and Son&quot;, which was included in his 2003 collection &quot;Unearthed&quot;.

Apple&#x27;s third album, &quot;Extraordinary Machine&quot;, was originally produced by Jon Brion. In spring 2002, Apple and Brion, her longtime friend and producer on &quot;When the Pawn,&quot; met for their weekly lunch meeting. Brion reportedly &quot;begged&quot; Apple to make another album. Apple agreed, and Brion went to Apple&#x27;s label, Epic Records, with strict stipulations (including no deadline), which the label eventually agreed to. Recording sessions began in 2002, at Ocean Way Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, but later moved to the Paramour Mansion in Los Angeles. Work on the album continued until 2003, and in May of that year it was submitted to Sony executives. In 2004 and 2005, tracks were leaked on the Internet in MP3 format and played on U.S. and international radio. Subsequently, MP3s of the entire album went online. Although a website distributing the album was quickly shut down, it soon reached P2P networks and was downloaded by fans. A fan-led campaign supported the album&#x27;s official release.

Mike Elizondo, who had previously played bass on &quot;Pawn&quot;, was brought back as co-producer to complete the tracks he had begun with Brion and Apple. &quot;Spin&quot; later reported the following: &quot;Fans erroneously thought that Apple&#x27;s record label, Epic, had rejected the first version of &quot;Extraordinary Machine&quot;... in reality, according to Elizondo, Apple was unhappy with the results, and it was her decision to redo the record, not her label&#x27;s.&quot; In August 2005, the album was given an October release date. Production had been largely redone &quot;from scratch&quot; by Elizondo and was co-produced by Brian Kehew. Two of the 11 previous leaked tracks were relatively unchanged, and one new song was also included. Despite suggestions that the album had caused a rift between Brion and Apple, they regularly perform together at Largo, a club in Los Angeles, including a joint appearance with Elizondo on bass just before the news broke of an official release. &quot;Extraordinary Machine&quot; debuted at number seven and was nominated for a Grammy Award for &quot;Best Pop Vocal Album&quot;. It was eventually certified Gold, though its singles (&quot;Parting Gift&quot;, &quot;O&#x27; Sailor&quot;, &quot;Not About Love&quot;, and &quot;Get Him Back&quot;) failed to enter any &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. Apple went on a live tour to promote the album.
Beginning in the mid-2000s, Apple dated writer and television creator Jonathan Ames.
In June 2006, Apple appeared on the joke track &quot;Come Over and Get It (Up in &#x27;Dem Guts)&quot; by comedian Zach Galifianakis. Galifianakis previously appeared in the music video for Apple&#x27;s &quot;Not About Love&quot;. Apple recorded a cover of &quot;Sally&#x27;s Song&quot; for the 2006 special edition release of the soundtrack for the Tim Burton film &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot;. In May 2006, Apple paid tribute to Elvis Costello on VH1&#x27;s concert series &quot;Decades Rock Live,&quot; by performing Costello&#x27;s hit &quot;I Want You&quot;. Her version was subsequently released as a digital single. Apple toured the East Coast during August 2007, with Nickel Creek. In 2008, Apple recorded a duet titled &quot;Still I&quot; with Christophe Deluy. In 2009, Apple covered &quot;Why Try to Change Me Now&quot; and &quot;I Walk A Little Faster&quot; for &quot;The Best Is Yet to Come – The Songs of Cy Coleman&quot;.

In January 2010, Apple and Brion performed together at &quot;Love and Haiti, Too: A Music Benefit&quot;, a charity concert for the people hurt by the Haiti earthquake. Apple sang a cover of &quot;(S)he&#x27;s Funny That Way&quot;, composed by Neil Moret, lyrics by Richard Whiting, which is often associated with the singer Billie Holiday. In June 2010, Apple released a song titled &quot;So Sleepy&quot;, produced by Brion and written by children involved with the non-profit organization 826LA. The song was included on a compilation album released by the organization titled &quot;Chickens in Love&quot;. Apple collaborated with Margaret Cho on her album &quot;Cho Dependent&quot;, which was released on August 24, 2010.

===2011–2018: &quot;The Idler Wheel...&quot;, tour, and legal troubles===

In late 2010, &quot;Billboard&quot; published an article stating that Apple was planning on releasing a new album in spring 2011, with musician Michelle Branch claiming to have heard some of the new tracks. Drummer Charley Drayton also told &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine that he was co-producing the record. However, the album was not released in the spring and &quot;Billboard&quot; reported later that Epic was not aware of a record. Apple delayed the album&#x27;s release until 2012, explaining that she was waiting &quot;until her label found a new president and that she didn&#x27;t want her work to be mishandled amid corporate disarray.&quot; In January 2012, after its new record label head, LA Reid hinted at new music from Apple, Epic Records announced that the album would be released later in the year. Apple announced performances at the South by Southwest Festival and a spring 2012 tour soon after.

&quot;The Idler Wheel...&quot;, Apple&#x27;s fourth studio album, was released on June 19, 2012, in the United States. It became Apple&#x27;s most successful album on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, where it peaked at number three, and received critical acclaim. According to an article in &quot;American Songwriter&quot;, &quot;&quot;The Idler Wheel&quot; isn&#x27;t always pretty, but it pulses with life, brutal and true.&quot;

While promoting &quot;The Idler Wheel&quot;, Apple revealed in a June 2012 interview that she had briefly married an unnamed French photographer, later revealed to be Lionel Deluy, &quot;for complicated reasons&quot; and who had a passing liaison with a younger woman. She subsequently gave an in-depth interview on Marc Maron&#x27;s &quot;WTF&quot; podcast in July, in which she described her experience with obsessive–compulsive disorder throughout her adult life. She also divulged that she had recently decided to quit drinking. On September 19, 2012, Apple was arrested at an internal U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint in Sierra Blanca, Texas, and charged with possession of hashish, detaining her en route to a concert in Austin, Texas, at the Hudspeth County Jail.
Apple contributed a previously unreleased song entitled &quot;Dull Tool&quot; to the soundtrack of the 2012 Judd Apatow film &quot;This Is 40&quot;. Another song was recorded for the film but was not used, ending up as the track &quot;Cosmonauts&quot; on her 2020 album &quot;Fetch the Bolt Cutters&quot;. In November 2012, Apple wrote a letter to her fans – a scan of which was posted to her website and her Facebook page – postponing the South American leg of her tour due to the health of her dog, Janet. According to the letter, the dog has Addison&#x27;s disease and has had a tumor &quot;idling in her chest&quot; for two years.

In September 2013, a Chipotle ad appeared online with a soundtrack of Apple covering &quot;Pure Imagination&quot; from the 1971 film &quot;Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory&quot;. The video, which follows a scarecrow as he discovers the truth about factory farming and processed food, was described as &quot;haunted&quot;, &quot;dystopian&quot;, &quot;bizarre&quot;, and &quot;beautiful&quot;.

In 2014, Apple wrote the opening theme, &quot;Container&quot;, for the Showtime drama series &quot;The Affair&quot;. During 2014, Apple also appeared at a number of performances by Blake Mills, including in New York City and Cambridge, Massachusetts, during his tour in support of his second full-length album, &quot;Heigh Ho&quot;. The pair first publicly collaborated on an acoustic version of Apple&#x27;s song &quot;I Know&quot; in 2013.

Apple has collaborated with Andrew Bird, and in 2016, she was featured in the song &quot;Left Handed Kisses&quot; from the album &quot;Are You Serious&quot;. In September 2017, Apple played rarities at the Ohana Festival in Dana Point, California. Also in 2017, she released &quot;Tiny Hands&quot; for the Women&#x27;s March on Washington. In 2018, she joined Shirley Manson at the female-driven Girl School Festival in Los Angeles for a cover of &quot;You Don&#x27;t Own Me&quot; by Lesley Gore, wearing a white T-shirt with &quot;KNEEL, PORTNOW&quot; written across it in ink. This was considered in response to Grammy head Neil Portnow&#x27;s heavily criticized comments that women need to &quot;step up&quot; to earn more Grammy nods.

===2019–present: &quot;Fetch the Bolt Cutters&quot;===
In January 2019, Apple collaborated with King Princess on a version of her 1999 song &quot;I Know&quot;. The song was released for Spotify&#x27;s RISE program on January 25. Apple was featured in the documentary and soundtrack for &quot;Echo in the Canyon&quot; with Jakob Dylan covering songs by artists such as the Beach Boys and the Byrds. In November, she covered &quot;Whole of the Moon,&quot; a Waterboys song, for the series finale of Showtime&#x27;s &quot;The Affair&quot;.

In two Instagram posts in March 2019, Apple hinted at the recording of a fifth album. In a September 2019 interview with &quot;Vulture&quot;, she confirmed that the album was in its final stages, recorded with a band and planned for an early 2020 release. In a follow-up interview with &quot;Vulture&quot; in January 2020, she said her new album would likely be out &quot;in a few months.&quot; On March 8, 2020, Apple posted a video showcasing her saying &quot;M-Y-R-E-C-O-R-D-I-S-D-O-N-E&quot; in fingerspelling. In an interview with &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, it was announced that the album was to be titled &quot;Fetch the Bolt Cutters&quot;. The album, which consists of 13 self-produced tracks, was released digitally on April 17, 2020. The album was met with widespread acclaim by music critics. At the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, the album won Best Alternative Music Album and the lead single &quot;Shameika&quot; won Best Rock Performance.

On June 17, 2020, Apple was confirmed as an additional musician featuring on Bob Dylan&#x27;s 39th album &quot;Rough and Rowdy Ways&quot;, playing piano on the track &quot;Murder Most Foul&quot;. On April 15, 2021, Apple covered Sharon Van Etten&#x27;s &quot;Love More&quot;, from the 10th anniversary of Van Etten&#x27;s second album, &quot;Epic&quot;. In December, she was featured on a cover of the Christmas classic &quot;Silent Night&quot; released by Phoebe Bridgers alongside her Christmas EP &quot;If We Make It Through December&quot;. Apple joined with Bear McCreary to perform his composition &quot;Where the Shadows Lie&quot;, the end credits theme for &quot;Alloyed&quot;, the final episode of the first season of &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&quot;. The song features Apple singing the Ring Verse, part of which is inscribed upon the One Ring in Black Speech.

==Musical style and influences==
Apple&#x27;s music has been labeled as art pop, baroque pop, chamber pop, art rock, alternative rock, and jazz pop. According to Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic, &quot;[Apple&#x27;s] roots lay in jazz, show tunes, and classic &#x27;70s singer/songwriters, [a] blend that came into sharper focus on her second album, When the Pawn.&quot;

==Philanthropy==
On June 30, 2019, Apple pledged to donate two years&#x27; worth of earnings from TV and movie placements of her song &quot;Criminal&quot; to the While They Wait fund, which assists refugees with basic necessities, immigration fees and legal services. In 2020, While They Wait&#x27;s Scott Hechinger revealed to &quot;Vulture&quot; that Apple had donated $90,000, which would help 15 families. Since 2021, Apple has been a volunteer court watcher for Courtwatch PG. In June 2020, Apple pledged to donate two years&#x27; worth of earnings from TV and movie placements of her song &quot;Shameika&quot; to the Harlem Children&#x27;s Zone.

<text>Gender studies is an interdisciplinary academic field devoted to analysing gender identity and gendered representation. Gender studies originated in the field of women&#x27;s studies, concerning women, feminism, gender, and politics. The field now overlaps with queer studies and men&#x27;s studies. Its rise to prominence, especially in Western universities after 1990, coincided with the rise of deconstruction.

Disciplines that frequently contribute to gender studies include the fields of literature, linguistics, human geography, history, political science, archaeology, economics, sociology, psychology, anthropology, cinema, musicology, media studies, human development, law, public health, and medicine. Gender studies also analyzes how race, ethnicity, location, social class, nationality, and disability intersect with the categories of gender and sexuality. In gender studies, the term &quot;gender&quot; is often used to refer to the social and cultural constructions of masculinity and femininity, rather than biological aspects of the male or female sex; however, this view is not held by all gender scholars.

Gender is pertinent to many disciplines, such as literary theory, drama studies, film theory, performance theory, contemporary art history, anthropology, sociology, sociolinguistics and psychology. These disciplines sometimes differ in their approaches to how and why gender is studied. In politics, gender can be viewed as a foundational discourse that political actors employ in order to position themselves on a variety of issues. Gender studies is also a discipline in itself, incorporating methods and approaches from a wide range of disciplines.

Many fields came to regard &quot;gender&quot; as a practice, sometimes referred to as something that is performative. Feminist theory of psychoanalysis, articulated mainly by Julia Kristeva and Bracha L. Ettinger, and informed both by Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan and the object relations theory, is very influential in gender studies.

==Influences==

===Psychoanalytic theory===

A number of theorists have influenced the field of gender studies significantly, specifically in terms of psychoanalytic theory. Among these are Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, Julia Kristeva, and Bracha L. Ettinger. Gender studied under the lens of each of these theorists looks somewhat different. In a Freudian system, women are &quot;mutilated and must learn to accept their lack of a penis&quot; (in Freud&#x27;s terms a &quot;deformity&quot;). Lacan, however, organizes femininity and masculinity according to different unconscious structures. Both male and female subjects participate in the &quot;phallic&quot; organization, and the feminine side of sexuation is &quot;supplementary&quot; and not opposite or complementary. Lacan uses the concept of sexuation (sexual situation), which posits the development of gender-roles and role-play in childhood, to counter the idea that gender identity is innate or biologically determined. According to Lacan, the sexuation of an individual has as much, if not more, to do with their development of a gender identity as being genetically sexed male or female.

Kristeva contends that patriarchal cultures, like individuals, have to exclude the maternal and the feminine so that they can come into being. Bracha L. Ettinger transformed subjectivity in contemporary psychoanalysis since the early 1990s with the Matrixial feminine-maternal and prematernal Eros of borderlinking (bordureliance), borderspacing (bordurespacement) and co-emergence. The matrixial feminine difference defines a particular gaze and it is a source for trans-subjectivity and transjectivity in both males and females. Ettinger rethinks the human subject as informed by the archaic connectivity to the maternal and proposes the idea of a Demeter-Persephone Complexity.

====Feminist psychoanalytic theory====
Feminist theorists such as Juliet Mitchell, Nancy Chodorow, Jessica Benjamin, Jane Gallop, Bracha L. Ettinger, Shoshana Felman, Griselda Pollock, Luce Irigaray and Jane Flax have developed a Feminist psychoanalysis and argued that psychoanalytic theory is vital to the feminist project and must, like other theoretical traditions, be criticized by women as well as transformed to free it from vestiges of sexism (i.e. being censored). Shulamith Firestone, in &quot;The Dialectic of Sex&quot;, calls Freudianism the misguided feminism and discusses how Freudianism is &quot;almost&quot; completely accurate, with the exception of one crucial detail: everywhere that Freud writes &quot;penis&quot;, the word should be replaced with &quot;power&quot;.

Critics such as Elizabeth Grosz accuse Jacques Lacan of maintaining a sexist tradition in psychoanalysis. Others, such as Judith Butler, Bracha L. Ettinger and Jane Gallop have used Lacanian work, though in a critical way, to develop gender studies. According to J. B. Marchand, &quot;The gender studies and queer theory are rather reluctant, hostile to see the psychoanalytic approach.&quot; For Jean-Claude Guillebaud, gender studies (and activists of sexual minorities) &quot;besieged&quot; and consider psychoanalysis and psychoanalysts as &quot;the new priests, the last defenders of the genital normality, morality, moralism or even obscurantism&quot;.

Judith Butler&#x27;s worries about the psychoanalytic outlook under which sexual difference is &quot;undeniable&quot; and pathologizing any effort to suggest that it is not so paramount and unambiguous ...&quot;. According to Daniel Beaune and Caterina Rea, the gender-studies &quot;often criticized psychoanalysis to perpetuate a family and social model of patriarchal, based on a rigid and timeless version of the parental order&quot;.

===Literary theory===
Psychoanalytically oriented French feminism focused on visual and literary theory all along. Virginia Woolf&#x27;s legacy as well as &quot;Adrienne Rich&#x27;s call for women&#x27;s revisions of literary texts, and history as well, has galvanized a generation of feminist authors to reply with texts of their own&quot;. Griselda Pollock and other feminists have articulated Myth and poetry and literature, from the point of view of gender.

===Post-modern influence===
The emergence of post-modernism theories affected gender studies, causing a movement in identity theories away from the concept of fixed or essentialist gender identity, to post-modern fluid or multiple identities. The impact of post-structuralism, and its literary theory aspect post-modernism, on gender studies was most prominent in its challenge of grand narratives. Post-structuralism paved the way for the emergence of queer theory in gender studies, which necessitated the field expanding its purview to sexuality.

In addition to the expansion to include sexuality studies, under the influence of post-modernism gender studies has also turned its lens toward masculinity studies, due to the work of sociologists and theorists such as R. W. Connell, Michael Kimmel, and E. Anthony Rotundo. These changes and expansions have led to some contentions within the field, such as the one between second wave feminists and queer theorists. The line drawn between these two camps lies in the problem as feminists see it of queer theorists arguing that everything is fragmented and there are not only no grand narratives but also no trends or categories. Feminists argue that this erases the categories of gender altogether but does nothing to antagonize the power dynamics reified by gender. In other words, the fact that gender is socially constructed does not undo the fact that there are strata of oppression between genders.

==Development of theory==

===History===

The history of gender studies looks at the different perspectives of gender. This discipline examines the ways in which historical, cultural, and social events shape the role of gender in different societies. The field of gender studies, while focusing on the differences between men and women, also looks at sexual differences and less binary definitions of gender categorization.

After the universal suffrage revolution of the twentieth century, the women&#x27;s liberation movement of the 1960s and 1970s promoted a revision from the feminists to &quot;actively interrogate&quot; the usual and accepted versions of history as it was known at the time. It was the goal of many feminist scholars to question original assumptions regarding women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s attributes, to actually measure them, and to report observed differences between women and men. Initially, these programs were essentially feminist, designed to recognize contributions made by women as well as by men. Soon, men began to look at masculinity the same way that women were looking at femininity, and developed an area of study called &quot;men&#x27;s studies&quot;. It was not until the late 1980s and 1990s that scholars recognized a need for study in the field of sexuality. This was due to the increasing interest in lesbian and gay rights, and scholars found that most individuals will associate sexuality and gender together, rather than as separate entities.

Although doctoral programs for women&#x27;s studies have existed since 1990, the first doctoral program for a potential PhD in gender studies in the United States was approved in November 2005. In 2015, Kabul University became the first university in Afghanistan to offer a master&#x27;s degree course in gender and women&#x27;s studies. After the Taliban took over the Afghan capital, the university fell under their control and banned women from attending.

===Women&#x27;s studies===

Women&#x27;s studies is an interdisciplinary academic field devoted to topics concerning women, feminism, gender, and politics. It often includes feminist theory, women&#x27;s history (e.g. a history of women&#x27;s suffrage) and social history, women&#x27;s fiction, women&#x27;s health, feminist psychoanalysis and the feminist and gender studies-influenced practice of most of the humanities and social sciences.

===Men&#x27;s studies===

Men&#x27;s studies is an interdisciplinary academic field devoted to topics concerning men, gender, and politics. It often includes feminist theory, men&#x27;s history and social history, men&#x27;s fiction, men&#x27;s health, feminist psychoanalysis and the feminist and gender studies-influenced practice of most of the humanities and social sciences. Timothy Laurie and Anna Hickey-Moody suggest that there &#x27;have always been dangers present in the institutionalisation of &quot;masculinity studies&quot; as a semi-gated community&#x27;, and note that &#x27;a certain triumphalism vis-à-vis feminist philosophy haunts much masculinities research&#x27;.

Within studies on men, it is important to distinguish the specific approach often defined as Critical Studies on Men. This approach was largely developed in the anglophone countries from the early 1980s – especially in the United Kingdom – centred then around the work of Jeff Hearn, David Morgan and colleagues. The influence of the approach has spread globally since then. It is inspired primarily by a range of feminist perspectives (including socialist and radical) and places emphasis on the need for research and practice to explicitly challenge men&#x27;s and boys&#x27; sexism. Although it explores a very broad range of men&#x27;s practices, it tends to focus especially on issues related to sexuality and/or men&#x27;s violences. Although originally largely rooted in sociology, it has since engaged with a broad range of other disciplines including social policy, social work, cultural studies, gender studies, education and law. In more recent years, Critical Studies on Men research has made particular use of comparative and/or transnational perspectives. Like Men&#x27;s Studies and Masculinity Studies more generally, Critical Studies on Men has been critiqued for its failure to adequately focus on the issue of men&#x27;s relations with children as a key site for the development of men&#x27;s masculinity formations – men&#x27;s relations with women and men&#x27;s relations with other men being the two sites which are heavily researched by comparison.

===Gender in Asia and Polynesia===
Certain issues associated with gender in Eastern Asia and the Pacific Region are more complex and depend on location and context. For example, in China, Vietnam, Thailand, Philippines and Indonesia, a heavy importance of what defines a woman comes from the workforce. In these countries, &quot;gender related challenges tend to be related to economic empowerment, employment, and workplace issues, for example related to informal sector workers, feminization of migration flows, work place conditions, and long term social security&quot;. However, in countries who are less economically stable, such as Papua New Guinea, Timor Leste, Laos, Cambodia, and some provinces in more remote locations, &quot;women tend to bear the cost of social and domestic conflicts and natural disasters&quot;.

Places such as India and Polynesia have widely identified third-gender categories. For example, the hijra/kinnar/kinner people of India are often regarded as being a third-gender. Hijra is often considered an offensive term, so the terms kinnar &amp; kinner are often used for these individuals. In places such as India and Pakistan, these individuals face higher rates of HIV infection, depression, and homelessness. Polynesian languages are also consistent with the idea of a third-gender or non-binary gender. The Samoan term &quot;fa&#x27;afafine&quot;, meaning &quot;in the manner of a woman&quot;, is used to refer to a third-gender/non-binary role in society. These sexualities are expressed across a spectrum, although some literature has suggested that &quot;fa&#x27;afafine&quot; individuals do not form sexual relations with one another.

One issue that remains consistent throughout all provinces in different stages of development is women having a weak voice when it comes to decision-making. One of the reasons for this is the &quot;growing trend to decentralization [which] has moved decision-making down to levels at which women&#x27;s voice is often weakest and where even the women&#x27;s civil society movement, which has been a powerful advocate at national level, struggles to organize and be heard&quot;.

East Asia Pacific&#x27;s approach to help mainstream these issues of gender relies on a three-pillar method. Pillar one is partnering with middle-income countries and emerging middle-income countries to sustain and share gains in growth and prosperity. Pillar two supports the developmental underpinnings for peace, renewed growth and poverty reduction in the poorest and most fragile areas. The final pillar provides a stage for knowledge management, exchange and dissemination on gender responsive development within the region to begin. These programs have already been established, and successful in, Vietnam, Thailand, China, as well as the Philippines, and efforts are starting to be made in Laos, Papua New Guinea, and Timor Leste as well. These pillars speak to the importance of showcasing gender studies.

===Judith Butler===
Philosopher and gender studies Judith Butler&#x27;s work &quot;Gender Trouble&quot; discussed gender performativity. In Butler&#x27;s terms the performance of gender, sex, and sexuality is about power in society. They locate the construction of the &quot;gendered, sexed, desiring subject&quot; in &quot;regulative discourses&quot;. A part of Butler&#x27;s argument concerns the role of sex in the construction of &quot;natural&quot; or coherent gender and sexuality. In their account, gender and heterosexuality are constructed as natural because the opposition of the male and female sexes is perceived as natural in the social imaginary. &quot;Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Beliefs About Gender and Sexuality&quot; is an article written by authors Emily Kane and , which explicitly focuses on the social construct of social opposition between men and women. Parallel to Butler&#x27;s argument, this article also argues that gender is constructed as &quot;natural&quot; within our society when in reality it contains arbitrary aspects. By pointing out distinct differences between gender aspects of both men and women, this article reveals the source of opposition that Butler mentions, arguing that &quot;men and women share a variety of interests based on personal circumstances and on social locations other than gender, but men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s gender interests do tend to differ.&quot;

==Criticism==
Historian and theorist Bryan Palmer argues that gender studies&#x27; current reliance on post-structuralism – with its reification of discourse and avoidance of the structures of oppression and struggles of resistance – obscures the origins, meanings, and consequences of historical events and processes, and he seeks to counter current trends in gender studies with an argument for the necessity to analyze lived experiences and the structures of subordination and power. Psychologist Debra W. Soh postulates that gender studies is composed of dubious scholarship, that it is an unscientific ideology, and that it causes needless disruption in the lives of children.

Feminist philosopher Rosi Braidotti has criticized gender studies as &quot;the take-over of the feminist agenda by studies on masculinity, which results in transferring funding from feminist faculty positions to other kinds of positions. There have been cases... of positions advertised as &#x27;gender studies&#x27; being given away to the &#x27;bright boys&#x27;. Some of the competitive take-over has to do with gay studies. Of special significance in this discussion is the role of the mainstream publisher Routledge who, in our opinion, is responsible for promoting gender as a way of deradicalizing the feminist agenda, re-marketing masculinity and gay male identity instead.&quot; Calvin Thomas countered that, &quot;as Joseph Allen Boone points out, &#x27;many of the men in the academy who are feminism&#x27;s most supportive &#x27;allies&#x27; &quot;are&quot; gay,&#x27;&quot; and that it is &quot;disingenuous&quot; to ignore the ways in which mainstream publishers such as Routledge have promoted feminist theorists.

Gender studies, and more particularly queer studies within gender studies, has been criticized by Catholic Church bishops and cardinals as an attack on human biology. Pope Francis has said that teaching about gender identity in schools is &quot;ideological colonization&quot; that threatens traditional families and fertile heterosexuality. France was one of the first countries where this claim became widespread when Catholic movements marched in the streets of Paris against the bill on gay marriage and adoption. Scholar of law and gender Bruno Perreau argues that this fear has deep historical roots, and that the rejection of gender studies and queer theory expresses anxieties about national identity and minority politics. Jayson Harsin argues that the French anti–&#x27;gender theory&#x27; movement demonstrates qualities of global right-wing populist post-truth politics.

Teaching certain aspects of gender studies was banned in public schools in New South Wales after an independent review into how the state teaches sex and health education and the controversial material included in the teaching materials.

=== Government attitudes ===

In Central and Eastern Europe, anti-gender movements are on the rise, especially in Hungary, Poland, and Russia.

==== Russia ====
In Russia, gender studies is currently tolerated; however, state-supported practices follow the traditional gender perspectives of those in power. The law related to prosecuting and sentencing domestic violence, for instance, was greatly limited in 2017. Since 2010, the Russian government has also been leading a campaign at the UNHRC to recognise Russian &quot;traditional values&quot; as a legitimate consideration in human rights protection and promotion.

==== Hungary ====
Gender studies programs were banned in Hungary in October 2018. In a statement released by Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán&#x27;s office, a spokesperson stated that &quot;The government&#x27;s standpoint is that people are born either male or female, and we do not consider it acceptable for us to talk about socially constructed genders rather than biological sexes.&quot; The ban has attracted criticism from several European universities which offer the program, among them the Budapest-based Central European University, whose charter was revoked by the government, and is widely seen as part of the Hungarian ruling party&#x27;s move away from democratic principles.

==== China ====
The Central People&#x27;s Government supports studies of gender and social development of gender in history and practices that lead to gender equality. Citing Mao Zedong&#x27;s philosophy, &quot;Women hold up half the sky&quot;, this may be seen as continuation of equality of men and women introduced as part of Cultural Revolution.

==== Romania ====
The Romanian Senate approved by broad majority in June 2020 an update of National Education Law that would ban theories and opinions on gender identity according to which gender is a separate concept from biological sex. In December 2020, the Constitutional Court of Romania overturned the ban; earlier, President Klaus Iohannis had challenged the bill.

<text>Joseph Charles Bonanno (born Giuseppe Carlo Bonanno; ; January 18, 1905 – May 11, 2002), sometimes referred to as Joe Bananas, was an Italian-American crime boss of the Bonanno crime family, which he ran from 1931 to 1968.

Bonanno was born in Castellammare del Golfo, Sicily, where his father was also involved in organized crime. At the age of three, Bonanno immigrated to New York City with his family, where he lived for about 10 years before he moved back to Italy. He later slipped back into the United States in 1924, by stowing away on a Cuban fishing boat bound for Tampa, Florida. After the Castellammarese War, during which Salvatore Maranzano was murdered in 1931, Bonanno reorganized most of the crime family as the Bonanno family. At age 26, Bonanno became one of the youngest-ever bosses of a crime family. In 1963, Bonanno made plans with Joseph Magliocco to assassinate several rivals on the Mafia Commission. When Magliocco gave the contract to one of his top hit men, Joseph Colombo, he revealed the plot to its targets. The Commission spared Magliocco&#x27;s life but forced him into retirement, while Bonanno fled to Canada. In 1964, he briefly returned to New York before disappearing until 1966. The &quot;Banana War&quot; ensued and lasted until 1968, when Bonanno retired to Arizona. Later in life, he became a writer, publishing the book &quot;A Man of Honor: The Autobiography of Joseph Bonanno&quot; in 1983. Bonanno died on May 11, 2002, in Tucson, Arizona.

==Early life==
Bonanno was born on January 18, 1905, in Castellammare del Golfo, Sicily, to Salvatore Bonanno and Catherine Bonventre. Joseph&#x27;s uncles, Giuseppe Bonanno and his older brother and advisor, Stefano, led a clan in Castellammare del Golfo. The clan&#x27;s strongest ally was the leader of the Magaddino clan Stefano Magaddino, the brother of Joseph&#x27;s maternal grandmother. During the 1900s, the clans feuded with Felice Buccellato, the boss of the Buccellato clan. After the murders of Stefano and Giuseppe, their younger brother, Salvatore, took revenge by killing members of the Buccellatos. In 1902, Magaddino arrived in New York and became a powerful member of the Castellammarese clan. When Joseph was three years old, his family moved to the United States and settled in Williamsburg, Brooklyn for about 10 years before returning to Italy. His father had returned to Sicily in 1911, and died of a heart attack in 1915. In 1921, Magaddino fled to Buffalo, New York to avoid murder charges.

Bonanno slipped back into the United States in 1924, by stowing away on a Cuban fishing boat bound for Tampa, Florida with Peter Magaddino. According to Bonanno, upon arriving at a train station in Jacksonville, Bonanno was detained by immigration officers and was later released under $1,000 bail. He was welcomed by Willie Moretti and an unidentified man. It was later revealed that Magaddino was responsible for bailing him out as a favour for Giovanni Bonventre, Bonanno&#x27;s uncle. Bonanno first worked at a bakery owned by his uncle and later took up acting classes near Union Square, Manhattan. He had become active in the Mafia during his youth in Italy, and he fled to the United States after Benito Mussolini initiated a crackdown. Bonanno himself claimed years later that he fled because he was ardently anti-Fascist.

Bonanno became involved in bootlegging activities. He operated a distillery located inside an apartment building basement with Gaspar DiGregorio and Giovanni Romano, who was later killed in the distillery due to an accidental explosion. During this time, boss Salvatore Maranzano took a liking to Bonanno and became his mentor.

==The Castellammarese War and aftermath==
During the Castellammarese War, between 1930 and 1931, Maranzano and Bonanno fought against a rival group based in Brooklyn, led by Joe Masseria and Giuseppe Morello. However, a third, secret, faction soon emerged, composed of younger mafiosi on both sides. These younger mafiosi were disgusted with the old-world predilections of Masseria, Maranzano and other old-line mafiosi, whom they called &quot;Mustache Petes.&quot; This group of &quot;Young Turk&quot; mafiosi was led by Masseria&#x27;s second-in-command, Lucky Luciano, and included Frank Costello, Vito Genovese, Joe Adonis, Carlo Gambino and Albert Anastasia on the Masseria side and Joe Profaci, Tommy Gagliano, Tommy Lucchese, Joseph Magliocco and Stefano Magaddino on the Maranzano side. Although Bonanno was more steeped in the old-school traditions of &quot;honor&quot;, &quot;tradition&quot;, &quot;respect&quot; and &quot;dignity&quot; than other mafiosi of his generation, he saw the need to modernize and joined forces with the Young Turks.

In a secret deal with Maranzano, Luciano agreed to engineer the death of his boss, Masseria, in return for receiving Masseria&#x27;s rackets and becoming Maranzano&#x27;s second-in-command; he was killed April 15, 1931. However, although Maranzano was slightly more forward-thinking than Masseria, Luciano had come to believe that Maranzano was even more greedy and hidebound than Masseria had been, declaring himself &quot;capo di tutti capi&quot; (boss of all bosses); as a consequence, Luciano arranged Maranzano&#x27;s murder on September 10, 1931.

After Maranzano&#x27;s death, Bonanno became boss–or as he called himself, &quot;Father&quot;–of the bulk of Maranzano&#x27;s family. At the age of 26, Bonanno became one of the youngest-ever bosses of a crime family. Bonanno&#x27;s role in the events leading up to Maranzano&#x27;s death has been disputed. Years later, Bonanno wrote in his autobiography that he did not know about Luciano&#x27;s plans; he claimed to have only learned about them from Magaddino. According to Bonanno, he subsequently learned that Maranzano and Luciano had had a falling out over influence in the Garment District. Reportedly, relations between the two had soured to the point that Maranzano was planning to kill Luciano as early as one day after Maranzano was ultimately assassinated. Maranzano had given the contract to Irish gangster Vincent &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Coll, who was actually on his way to Maranzano&#x27;s office on the day of Maranzano&#x27;s death. According to Bonanno, he concluded that going to war with Luciano would serve no purpose, since Luciano only wanted to be left alone to run his own rackets and &quot;demanded nothing from us.&quot; He also believed that his soldiers would not be enthused about going to the mattresses again so soon after the end of the Castellamarese War. For this reason, Bonanno said, he decided to choose &quot;the path of peace.&quot; However, according to mob expert Anthony Bruno, it &quot;defies mob logic&quot; to believe that Luciano would have allowed Bonanno to stay alive had Bonanno still supported Maranzano.

In place of the &quot;capo di tutti capi&quot; in Maranzano&#x27;s plan, Luciano established a national commission in which each of the families would be represented by their boss and to which each family would owe allegiance. Each family would be largely autonomous in their designated area, but the Commission would arbitrate disputes between gangs.

In 1931, two months after Maranzano was murdered, Bonanno was married to Fay Labruzzo (December 31, 1905 – September 9, 1980). They had three children: Salvatore &quot;Bill&quot; Bonanno, Catherine, and Joseph Charles Jr.

Bonanno had property in Hempstead, New York, and later Middletown, New York. His son, Bill developed a severe mastoid ear infection at the age of 10; his parents enrolled him in a Catholic boarding school in the dry climate of Tucson, Arizona. After this, Bonanno also maintained a home in Tucson from the early 1940s.

==Bonanno family==

Bonanno had several legitimate businesses, including three coat manufacturing companies, laundries, cheese suppliers (through Lino Saputo between 1964 and 1979), funeral homes, and a trucking company. The funeral parlor Bonanno owned in Brooklyn was suspected to be used as a front for disposing of bodies, building double-decker coffins to fit more than one body so that both would be buried in one grave. Bonanno became a U.S. citizen in 1945,; later that year, he was convicted of violating wage laws and fined $450.

Bonanno allegedly attended the Grand Hotel et des Palmes Mafia meeting in Palermo in October 1957. A month later, in November 1957, the Apalachin Conference was called by Vito Genovese to discuss the future of Cosa Nostra, which Bonanno was reported to have attended. However, the meeting was aborted when police investigated the destination of the many out-of-state attendees&#x27; vehicles and arrested many of the fleeing mafiosi. Bonanno claimed he had skipped the meeting, but the attending capo Gaspar DiGregorio was carrying Bonanno&#x27;s recently renewed driver&#x27;s license. An official police report instead lists him as being caught fleeing on foot. All those apprehended were fined, up to $10,000 each, and given prison sentences ranging from three to five years. However, all the convictions were overturned on appeal in 1960. In any case, Bonanno suffered a heart attack and was removed from testifying in the trial.

==Commission plot and disappearance==
In 1963, Bonanno made plans to assassinate several rivals on the Mafia Commission—bosses Tommy Lucchese, Carlo Gambino, and Stefano Magaddino, as well as Frank DeSimone. Bonanno sought Profaci crime family boss Joseph Magliocco&#x27;s support, and Magliocco readily agreed due to his bitterness from being denied a seat on the Commission previously. Bonanno&#x27;s audacious goal was to take over the Commission and make Magliocco his right-hand man.

Magliocco was assigned the task of killing Lucchese and Gambino, and gave the contract to one of his top hit men, Joseph Colombo. However, the opportunistic Colombo revealed the plot to its targets. The other bosses realized that Magliocco could not have planned this himself. Remembering how close Bonanno was with Magliocco (and before him, Joe Profaci), as well as their close ties through marriages, the other bosses concluded Bonanno was the real mastermind.

The Commission summoned Bonanno and Magliocco to explain themselves. In mid 1964, Bonanno fled to Montreal, leaving Magliocco to deal with the Commission. Badly shaken and in failing health, Magliocco confessed his role in the plot. The Commission spared Magliocco&#x27;s life, but forced him to retire as Profaci family boss and pay a $50,000 fine. As a reward for turning on his boss, Colombo took control of the Profaci family. On Bonanno&#x27;s immigration documents, he falsely declared that he had never been convicted of a criminal offense. Bonanno was detained for nearly 90 days at Bordeaux Prison until he was forced to leave Canada.

In October 1964, he returned to Manhattan, but on October 21, 1964, the day before Bonanno was scheduled to testify to a grand jury inquiry, his lawyers said that after having dinner with them, Bonanno was kidnapped, allegedly by Magaddino&#x27;s men, as he entered the apartment house where one of his lawyers lived on Park Avenue and East 36th Street. FBI recordings of New Jersey boss Sam &quot;The Plumber&quot; DeCavalcante revealed that the other bosses were taken by surprise when Bonanno disappeared, and other FBI recordings captured angry Bonanno soldiers saying, &quot;That son-of-a-bitch took off and left us here alone.&quot;

==The &quot;Banana War&quot;==
During Bonanno&#x27;s two-year absence, Gaspar DiGregorio took advantage of family discontent over Bill Bonanno&#x27;s role to claim family leadership. The Mafia Commission named DiGregorio as Bonanno family boss, and the DiGregorio revolt led to four years of strife in the Bonanno family, labeled by the media as the &quot;Banana War&quot;. This led to a divide in the family between loyalists to Bill and loyalists to DiGregorio.

In early 1966, DiGregorio allegedly contacted Bill about having a peace meeting. Bill agreed and suggested his grand-uncle&#x27;s house on Troutman Street in Brooklyn as a meeting site. On January 28, 1966, as Bill and his loyalists approached the house, they were met with gunfire; no one was wounded during this confrontation.

Bonanno reappeared on May 17, 1966, at Foley Square. In 1968, DiGregorio was wounded by machine gun fire and later suffered a heart attack. The Commission eventually became dissatisfied with DiGregorio&#x27;s efforts at quelling the family rebellion, and eventually dropped DiGregorio and swung their support to Paul Sciacca. In 1968, after a heart attack, Bonanno ended the family warfare by agreeing to retire as boss and move to Arizona. As part of this peace agreement, Bill also resigned as consigliere and moved out of New York with his father.

==Later career in Arizona and California==

In 1974, Bonanno and his son subsequently moved to Arizona, living in the Catalina Vista neighborhood of Tucson, Arizona with his family.

In the late 1970s, his two sons, Bill and Joe Jr., brought high heat in Northern California after getting involved with Lou Peters, a Cadillac-Oldsmobile dealer, in San Jose, Lodi and Stockton. Louis E. Peters turned into a confidential informant for the FBI, helping them indict Bonanno.

In April 1983, Joseph Bonanno and his son Bill appeared on the CBS News TV program &quot;60 Minutes&quot; to be interviewed by correspondent Mike Wallace.

Later in 1983, he served eight months in prison for obstruction of justice. In 1985, he was imprisoned for 14 months for contempt of court after refusing to testify in a federal racketeering case. Assigned federal inmate number 07255-008, he was transferred from the Federal Correctional Institution in Tucson, Arizona to the U.S. Medical Center for Federal Prisoners in Springfield, Missouri due to ill health at his advanced age and released on November 1, 1986.

During Bill Bonanno&#x27;s trial, he gave interviews to author Gay Talese that formed part of the basis of his 1971 true crime book &quot;Honor Thy Father&quot;. Joseph Bonanno was initially infuriated by the book and refused to speak to Bill for a year. By the late 1970s, however, Bonanno&#x27;s attitude had changed; he had become interested in writing an autobiography to offer his own take on his life. Bonanno&#x27;s book was published in 1983 as &quot;A Man of Honor: The Autobiography of Joseph Bonanno&quot;. Bonanno justified his decision to write &quot;A Man of Honor&quot; on the grounds that omertà represented a lifestyle and tradition greater than or beyond just the code of silence it is generally understood to be: as he had not been compelled to reveal his secrets by becoming an informant or government witness, Bonanno reasoned, he did not violate his code of honor. Bonanno&#x27;s editor for &quot;A Man of Honor&quot; was publisher Michael Korda who said of Bonanno, &quot;In a world where most of the players were, at best, semiliterate, Bonanno read poetry, boasted of his knowledge of the classics, and gave advice to his cohorts in the form of quotes from Thucydides or Machiavelli.&quot;

Bonanno died on May 11, 2002, of heart failure at the age of 97. He is buried at Holy Hope Cemetery and Mausoleum in Tucson.

==In popular culture==
In 1991, Bonanno&#x27;s daughter-in-law, Rosalie Profaci Bonanno, published the memoir &quot;Mafia Marriage: My Story&quot;. This book was eventually converted to the 1993 Lifetime network film &quot;Love, Honor &amp; Obey: The Last Mafia Marriage&quot;. Bonanno was portrayed by Ben Gazzara.

In the 1991 film &quot;Mobsters&quot;, Joe Bonanno is portrayed by actor John Chappoulis.

In 1999, Showtime produced a biographical film called &quot;Bonanno: A Godfather&#x27;s Story&quot;, released on DVD as &quot;Youngest Godfather&quot;. The film chronicles the rise and fall of organized crime in the United States. Bonanno was portrayed by Martin Landau.

In 2004, Joe&#x27;s daughter-in-law began putting Joe&#x27;s personal items up for auction on eBay. This continued until 2008.

In 2006, episode 66 of &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, &quot;Members Only&quot;, Eugene Pontecorvo wants to retire and uses Joe Bonanno as an example of a retired mob member. Also in episode 76, &quot;Cold Stones&quot;, Tony mentions that &quot;Joe Bananas&quot; went to war against Carlo Gambino for seven years.

In 2009, Joe&#x27;s cousin, Thomas Bonanno, participated as a Mafia expert in the filming of &quot;Deadliest Warrior&quot;: &quot;Mafia vs. Yakuza&quot;, demonstrating his skills and marksmanship with a Thompson submachine gun as well as talking about &quot;true&quot; Sicilian Mafia philosophy and culture.

In 2014, &quot;Eldorado&quot;, the series finale of &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;, Joe Bonanno, played by Amadeo Fusca, has a non-speaking cameo role. He is seen sitting at the table as Lucky Luciano gathers the country&#x27;s most powerful crime bosses and forms The Commission.

He is portrayed by Chazz Palminteri in the 2019 TV series &quot;Godfather of Harlem&quot;.

In the 2019 film &quot;The Irishman&quot;, Frank Sheeran (played by Robert De Niro) compares Bonanno&#x27;s &quot;kidnapping&quot;, in a telephone conversation with the wife of Jimmy Hoffa, to her husband&#x27;s disappearance.

He is portrayed by Sal Landi on the 2022 TV series &quot;The Offer&quot;.

<doc id="58857" wikidata="Q3272185" url="?curid=58857" title="Gymnosporangium">
<text>Gymnosporangium is a genus of heteroecious plant-pathogenic fungi which alternately infect members of the family Cupressaceae, primarily species in the genus &quot;Juniperus&quot; (junipers), and members of the family Rosaceae in the subfamily Amygdaloideae (apples, pears, quinces, shadbush, hawthorns, rowans and their relatives). The common name cedar-apple rusts has been used for these fungi. According to the &quot;Dictionary of the Fungi&quot; (10th edition, 2008), there was 57 species in the genus. In 2023, Species Fungorum lists up to 74 species.

In junipers (the primary hosts, see photo), some species form a ball-like gall about 2–4 cm in diameter which produces a set of orange tentacle-like spore tubes called telial horns. These horns expand and have a jelly like consistency when wet. In other species, such as in &quot;G. clarvariforme&quot;, the telia are produced directly from the bark of the juniper with no obvious gall formation or swelling. The basidiospores are released and travel on the wind until they infect an apple, pear, hawthorn or suitable tree. 

On the secondary hosts, the fungus produces yellowish depressions on the leaves. It also infects the fruit, which grows whitish tubes like a Medusa head. These are the spore tubes. These aeciospores must then infect a juniper to complete the life cycle. All the types of spores can spread over long distances.

The fungus does not cause serious damage to junipers, but apple and pear trees can suffer serious loss of fruit production due to the effects of the fungus. Although the genus has a worldwide distribution, its impact depends on availability of its two host plant species. Individual species are found in Northern and Central America, Asia, Europe and the Middle East.

Due to the economic impacts of the rusts in some areas where orchards are of commercial importance, some regions have attempted to ban the planting of and/or eradicate the coniferous hosts.

In 2020, the monotypic family &quot;Gymnosporangiaceae&quot; was proposed to accommodate &quot;Gymnosporangium&quot;. As accepted by Wijayawardene et al. 2020.

<text>New Zealand is divided into sixteen regions for local government purposes. Eleven are administered by regional councils, and five are administered by unitary authorities, which are territorial authorities that also perform the functions of regional councils. The Chatham Islands Council is not a region but is similar to a unitary authority, authorised under its own legislation.

==Current regions==
===History and statutory basis===
The regional councils are listed in Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Local Government Act 2002, along with reference to the &quot;Gazette&quot; notices that established them in 1989. The act requires regional councils to promote sustainable developmentthe social, economic, environmental and cultural well-being of their communities.

The current regions and most of their councils came into being through a local government reform in 1989 that took place under the Local Government Act 1974. The regional councils replaced the more than 700 ad hoc bodies that had been formed in the preceding century – roads boards, catchment boards, drainage boards, pest control boards, harbour boards, domain and reserve boards. In addition they took over some roles that had previously been performed by county councils.

The boundaries of the regions are based largely on drainage basins. This anticipated the responsibilities of the Resource Management Act 1991. Most regional boundaries conform with territorial authority boundaries but there are a number of exceptions. An example is Taupo District, split between four regions, although most of its area is in the Waikato region. There is often a high degree of co-operation between regional and territorial councils as they have complementary roles.

===Resource management functions===
Regional councils have these specific functions under the Resource Management Act 1991:
*Planning for the integrated management of natural and physical resources
*Planning for regionally significant land uses
*Soil conservation, water quality and quantity, water ecosystems, natural hazards, hazardous substances 
*Controlling the coastal marine area
*Controlling via resource consents the taking, use, damming or diverting of water 
*Controlling via resource consents the discharge of contaminants
*Establishing of rules in a regional plan to allocate water
*Controlling via resource consents the beds of waterbodies

===Other functions===
Regional councils have responsibility for functions under other statutes;

* flood and river control under the Soil Conservation and Rivers Control Act 1941,
* reserves vested in regional councils under the Reserves Act 1977,
* civil defence under the Civil Defence Act 1990,
* regional pest management under the Biosecurity Act 1993,
* harbour and water navigation under the Maritime Transport Act 1994,
* hazardous waste under the HSNO Act 1996, 
* public transport planning under the Land Transport Act 1998, and
* supervision of the safety of dams under the Building Act 2004.

Notes
=== Areas outside regional boundaries ===

Some outlying islands are not included within regional boundaries. The Chatham Islands is not in a region, although its council has some of the powers of a regional council under the Resource Management Act 1991. The Kermadecs and the subantarctic islands are inhabited only by a small number of Department of Conservation staff and there is no regional council for these islands.

===Governance===
Regional councils are popularly elected every three years in accordance with the Local Electoral Act 2001, except for the Canterbury regional council, which is a mixture of elected councillors and government appointed commissioners. Councils may use a first-past-the-post or single transferable vote system. The chairperson is selected by the elected council members.

===Finances===
Regional councils are funded through property rates, subsidies from central government, income from trading, and user charges for certain public services. Councils set their own levels of rates, though the mechanism for collecting it usually involves channelling through the territorial authority collection system.

== Regional chairs ==
==Predecessors of current structure==
===Auckland===
The Auckland Regional Council (now the Auckland Council) was preceded by the Auckland Regional Authority (ARA), which existed from 1963 to 1989.

===Wellington===
The Wellington Regional Council was first formed in 1980 from a merger of the Wellington Regional Planning Authority and the Wellington Regional Water Board.

===United councils===
In 1978, legislation was passed enabling the formation of regions that had &quot;united councils&quot;. Twenty regions were designated, excluding the Auckland and Wellington areas. For most of the country this was the first time there had been a regional level of government since the abolition of provinces in 1876.
Councillors were not elected directly – they were appointed from the various territorial local authorities (TLAs) within the region.

The only responsibilities mandated by the legislation were coordination of civil defence and development of a regional plan, although the constituent TLAs could agree on additional responsibilities at the point of formation of each united council. For example, in a number of cases the united council took responsibility for the allocation of revenue from regional petrol taxes.

The united councils were based in the facilities of the largest TLA in the region and largely dependent on the TLAs for resources. They were allowed to levy rates but in most cases had minimal operating budgets (below $100,000 per annum). The notable exception was Canterbury, where the united council had a number of responsibilities. Only one united council undertook any direct operational activity – a forestry project in Wanganui.

<text>An allergen is an otherwise harmless substance that triggers an allergic reaction in sensitive individuals by stimulating an immune response.

In technical terms, an allergen is an antigen that is capable of stimulating a type-I hypersensitivity reaction in atopic individuals through immunoglobulin E (IgE) responses. Most humans mount significant Immunoglobulin E responses only as a defense against parasitic infections. However, some individuals may respond to many common environmental antigens. This hereditary predisposition is called atopy. In atopic individuals, non-parasitic antigens stimulate inappropriate IgE production, leading to type I hypersensitivity.

Sensitivities vary widely from one person (or from one animal) to another. A very broad range of substances can be allergens to sensitive individuals.

== Examples ==

Allergens can be found in a variety of sources, such as dust mite excretion, pollen, pet dander, or even royal jelly. Food allergies are not as common as food sensitivity, but some foods such as peanuts (a legume), nuts, seafood and shellfish are the cause of serious allergies in many people.

The United States Food and Drug Administration recognizes nine foods as major food allergens: peanuts, tree nuts, eggs, milk, shellfish, fish, wheat, soy, and most recently sesame, as well as sulfites (chemical-based, often found in flavors and colors in foods) at 10ppm and over. In other countries, due to differences in the genetic profiles of their citizens and different levels of exposure to specific foods, the official allergen lists will vary. Canada recognizes all nine of the allergens recognized by the US as well as mustard. The European Union additionally recognizes other gluten-containing cereals as well as celery and lupin.

Another allergen is urushiol, a resin produced by poison ivy and poison oak, which causes the skin rash condition known as urushiol-induced contact dermatitis by changing a skin cell&#x27;s configuration so that it is no longer recognized by the immune system as part of the body. Various trees and wood products such as paper, cardboard, MDF etc. can also cause mild to severe allergy symptoms through touch or inhalation of sawdust such as asthma and skin rash.

An allergic reaction can be caused by any form of direct contact with the allergen—consuming food or drink one is sensitive to (ingestion), breathing in pollen, perfume or pet dander (inhalation), or brushing a body part against an allergy-causing plant (direct contact). Other common causes of serious allergy are wasp, fire ant and bee stings, penicillin, and latex. An extremely serious form of an allergic reaction is called anaphylaxis. One form of treatment is the administration of sterile epinephrine to the person experiencing anaphylaxis, which suppresses the body&#x27;s overreaction to the allergen, and allows for the patient to be transported to a medical facility.

== Seasonal ==
Seasonal allergy symptoms are commonly experienced during specific parts of the year, usually during spring, summer or fall when certain trees or grasses pollinate. This depends on the kind of tree or grass. For instance, some trees such as oak, elm, and maple pollinate in the spring, while grasses such as Bermuda, timothy and orchard pollinate in the summer.

Grass allergy is generally linked to hay fever because their symptoms and causes are somehow similar to each other. Symptoms include rhinitis, which causes sneezing and a runny nose, as well as allergic conjunctivitis, which includes watering and itchy eyes. Also an initial tickle on the roof of the mouth or in the back of the throat may be experienced.

Also, depending on the season, the symptoms may be more severe and people may experience coughing, wheezing, and irritability. A few people even become depressed, lose their appetite, or have problems sleeping. Moreover, since the sinuses may also become congested, some people experience headaches.

If both parents have had allergies in the past, there is a 66% chance for the individual to experience seasonal allergies, and the risk lowers to 60% if just one parent has had allergies. The immune system also has strong influence on seasonal allergies, because it reacts differently to diverse allergens like pollen. When an allergen enters the body of an individual that is predisposed to allergies, it triggers an immune reaction and the production of antibodies. These allergen antibodies migrate to mast cells lining the nose, eyes, and lungs. When an allergen drifts into the nose more than once, mast cells release a slew of chemicals or histamines that irritate and inflame the moist membranes lining the nose and produce the symptoms of an allergic reaction: scratchy throat, itching, sneezing and watery eyes. Some symptoms that differentiate allergies from a cold include:
* No fever.
* Mucous secretions are runny and clear.
* Sneezes occurring in rapid and several sequences.
* Itchy throat, ears and nose.
* These symptoms usually last longer than 7–10 days.

Among seasonal allergies, there are some allergens that fuse together and produce a new type of allergy. For instance, grass pollen allergens cross-react with food allergy proteins in vegetables such as onion, lettuce, carrots, celery, and corn. Besides, the cousins of birch pollen allergens, like apples, grapes, peaches, celery, and apricots, produce severe itching in the ears and throat. The cypress pollen allergy brings a cross reactivity between diverse species like olive, privet, ash and Russian olive tree pollen allergens. In some rural areas, there is another form of seasonal grass allergy, combining airborne particles of pollen mixed with mold.
Recent research has suggested that humans might develop allergies as a defense to fight off parasites. According to Yale University Immunologist Ruslan Medzhitov, protease allergens cleave the same sensor proteins that evolved to detect proteases produced by the parasitic worms. Additionally, a new report on seasonal allergies called &quot;Extreme allergies and Global Warming&quot;, have found that many allergy triggers are worsening due to climate change. 16 states in the United States were named as &quot;Allergen Hotspots&quot; for large increases in allergenic tree pollen if global warming pollution keeps increasing. Therefore, researchers on this report claimed that global warming is bad news for millions of asthmatics in the United States whose asthma attacks are triggered by seasonal allergies. Seasonal allergies are one of the main triggers for asthma, along with colds or flu, cigarette smoke and exercise. In Canada, for example, up to 75% of asthmatics also have seasonal allergies.

=== Diagnosis ===

Based on the symptoms seen on the patient, the answers given in terms of symptom evaluation and a physical exam, doctors can make a diagnosis to identify if the patient has a seasonal allergy. After performing the diagnosis, the doctor is able to tell the main cause of the allergic reaction and recommend the treatment to follow. 2 tests have to be done in order to determine the cause: a blood test and a skin test. Allergists do skin tests in one of two ways: either dropping some purified liquid of the allergen onto the skin and pricking the area with a small needle; or injecting a small amount of allergen under the skin.

Alternative tools are available to identify seasonal allergies, such as laboratory tests, imaging tests, and nasal endoscopy. In the laboratory tests, the doctor will take a nasal smear and it will be examined microscopically for factors that may indicate a cause: increased numbers of eosinophils (white blood cells), which indicates an allergic condition. If there is a high count of eosinophils, an allergic condition might be present.

Another laboratory test is the blood test for IgE (immunoglobulin production), such as the radioallergosorbent test (RAST) or the more recent enzyme allergosorbent tests (EAST), implemented to detect high levels of allergen-specific IgE in response to particular allergens. Although blood tests are less accurate than the skin tests, they can be performed on patients unable to undergo skin testing. Imaging tests can be useful to detect sinusitis in people who have chronic rhinitis, and they can work when other test results are ambiguous. There is also nasal endoscopy, wherein a tube is inserted through the nose with a small camera to view the passageways and examine any irregularities in the nose structure. Endoscopy can be used for some cases of chronic or unresponsive seasonal rhinitis.

== Fungal ==
In 1952 basidiospores were described as being possible airborne allergens and were linked to asthma in 1969. Basidiospores are the dominant airborne fungal allergens. Fungal allergies are associated with seasonal asthma. They are considered to be a major source of airborne allergens. The basidospore family include mushrooms, rusts, smuts, brackets, and puffballs. The airborne spores from mushrooms reach levels comparable to those of mold and pollens. The levels of mushroom respiratory allergy are as high as 30 percent of those with allergic disorder, but it is believed to be less than 1 percent of food allergies. Heavy rainfall (which increases fungal spore release) is associated with increased hospital admissions of children with asthma. A study in New Zealand found that 22 percent of patients with respiratory allergic disorders tested positive for basidiospores allergies. Mushroom spore allergies can cause either immediate allergic symptomatology or delayed allergic reactions. Those with asthma are more likely to have immediate allergic reactions and those with allergic rhinitis are more likely to have delayed allergic responses. A study found that 27 percent of patients were allergic to basidiomycete mycelia extracts and 32 percent were allergic to basidiospore extracts, thus demonstrating the high incidence of fungal sensitisation in individuals with suspected allergies. It has been found that of basidiomycete cap, mycelia, and spore extracts that spore extracts are the most reliable extract for diagnosing basidiomycete allergy.

In Canada, 8% of children attending allergy clinics were found to be allergic to Ganoderma, a basidiospore. Pleurotus ostreatus, cladosporium, and &quot;Calvatia cyathiformis&quot; are significant airborne spores. Other significant fungal allergens include aspergillus and alternaria-penicillin families. In India &quot;Fomes pectinatus&quot; is a predominant air-borne allergen affecting up to 22 percent of patients with respiratory allergies. Some fungal air-borne allergens such as &quot;Coprinus comatus&quot; are associated with worsening of eczematous skin lesions. Children who are born during autumn months (during fungal spore season) are more likely to develop asthmatic symptoms later in life.

=== Treatment ===
Treatment includes over-the-counter medications, antihistamines, nasal decongestants, allergy shots, and alternative medicine. In the case of nasal symptoms, antihistamines are normally the first option. They may be taken together with pseudoephedrine to help relieve a stuffy nose and they can stop the itching and sneezing. Some over-the-counter options are Benadryl and Tavist. However, these antihistamines may cause extreme drowsiness, therefore, people are advised to not operate heavy machinery or drive while taking this kind of medication. Other side effects include dry mouth, blurred vision, constipation, difficulty with urination, confusion, and light-headedness. There is also a newer second generation of antihistamines that are generally classified as the &quot;non-sedating antihistamines&quot; or anti-drowsy, which include cetirizine, loratadine, and fexofenadine.

An example of nasal decongestants is pseudoephedrine and its side-effects include insomnia, restlessness, and difficulty urinating. Some other nasal sprays are available by prescription, including Azelastine and Ipratropium. Some of their side-effects include drowsiness. For eye symptoms, it is important to first bath the eyes with plain eyewashes to reduce the irritation. People should not wear contact lenses during episodes of conjunctivitis.

Allergen immunotherapy treatment involves administering doses of allergens to accustom the body to induce specific long-term tolerance. Allergy immunotherapy can be administered orally (as sublingual tablets or sublingual drops), or by injections under the skin (subcutaneous). Immunotherapy contains a small amount of the substance that triggers the allergic reactions.

Ladders are also used for egg and milk allergies as a home-based therapy mainly for children. Such methods cited in the UK involve the gradual introduction of the allergen in a cooked form where the protein allergenicity has been reduced to become less potent. By reintroducing the allergen from a fully cooked, usually baked, state research suggests that a tolerance can emerge to certain egg and milk allergies under the supervision of a dietitian or specialist. The suitability of this treatment is debated between UK and North American experts.

<text>The classical mathematical puzzle known as the three utilities problem or sometimes water, gas and electricity asks for non-crossing connections to be drawn between three houses and three utility companies in the plane. When posing it in the early 20th century, Henry Dudeney wrote that it was already an old problem. It is an impossible puzzle: it is not possible to connect all nine lines without crossing. Versions of the problem on nonplanar surfaces such as a torus or Möbius strip, or that allow connections to pass through other houses or utilities, can be solved.

This puzzle can be formalized as a problem in topological graph theory by asking whether the complete bipartite graph formula_1, with vertices representing the houses and utilities and edges representing their connections, has a graph embedding in the plane. The impossibility of the puzzle corresponds to the fact that formula_1 is not a planar graph. Multiple proofs of this impossibility are known, and form part of the proof of Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem characterizing planar graphs by two forbidden subgraphs, one of which The question of minimizing the number of crossings in drawings of complete bipartite graphs is known as Turán&#x27;s brick factory problem, and for formula_1 the minimum number of crossings is one.

formula_1 is a graph with six vertices and nine edges, often referred to as the utility graph in reference to the problem. It has also been called the Thomsen graph after 19th-century chemist Julius Thomsen. It is a well-covered graph, the smallest triangle-free cubic graph, and the smallest non-planar minimally rigid graph.
==History==
A review of the history of the three utilities problem is given by . He states that most published references to the problem characterize it as &quot;very ancient&quot;. In the earliest publication found by Kullman, names it &quot;water, gas, and electricity&quot;. However, Dudeney states that the problem is &quot;as old as the hills...much older than electric lighting, or even gas&quot;. Dudeney also published the same puzzle previously, in &quot;The Strand Magazine&quot; in 1913. A competing claim of priority goes to Sam Loyd, who was quoted by his son in a posthumous biography as having published the problem in 1900.

Another early version of the problem involves connecting three houses to three wells. It is stated similarly to a different (and solvable) puzzle that also involves three houses and three fountains, with all three fountains and one house touching a rectangular wall; the puzzle again involves making non-crossing connections, but only between three designated pairs of houses and wells or fountains, as in modern numberlink puzzles. Loyd&#x27;s puzzle &quot;The Quarrelsome Neighbors&quot; similarly involves connecting three houses to three gates by three non-crossing paths (rather than nine as in the utilities problem); one house and the three gates are on the wall of a rectangular yard, which contains the other two houses within it.

As well as in the three utilities problem, the graph formula_1 appears in late 19th-century and early 20th-century publications both in early studies of structural rigidity and in chemical graph theory, where Julius Thomsen proposed it in 1886 for the then-uncertain structure of benzene. In honor of Thomsen&#x27;s work, formula_1 is sometimes called the Thomsen graph.

==Statement==
The three utilities problem can be stated as follows:

The problem is an abstract mathematical puzzle which imposes constraints that would not exist in a practical engineering situation. Its mathematical formalization is part of the field of topological graph theory which studies the embedding of graphs on surfaces. An important part of the puzzle, but one that is often not stated explicitly in informal wordings of the puzzle, is that the houses, companies, and lines must all be placed on a two-dimensional surface with the topology of a plane, and that the lines are not allowed to pass through other buildings; sometimes this is enforced by showing a drawing of the houses and companies, and asking for the connections to be drawn as lines on the same drawing.

In more formal graph-theoretic terms, the problem asks whether the complete bipartite graph formula_1 is a planar graph. This graph has six vertices in two subsets of three: one vertex for each house, and one for each utility. It has nine edges, one edge for each of the pairings of a house with a utility, or more abstractly one edge for each pair of a vertex in one subset and a vertex in the other subset. Planar graphs are the graphs that can be drawn without crossings in the plane, and if such a drawing could be found, it would solve the three utilities puzzle.

==Puzzle solutions==
===Unsolvability===

As it is usually presented (on a flat two-dimensional plane), the solution to the utility puzzle is &quot;no&quot;: there is no way to make all nine connections without any of the lines crossing each other.
In other words, the graph formula_1 is not planar. Kazimierz Kuratowski stated in 1930 that formula_1 is nonplanar, from which it follows that the problem has no solution. , however, states that &quot;Interestingly enough, Kuratowski did not publish a detailed proof that [ formula_1 ] is non-planar&quot;.

One proof of the impossibility of finding a planar embedding of formula_1 uses a case analysis involving the Jordan curve theorem. In this solution, one examines different possibilities for the locations of the vertices with respect to the 4-cycles of the graph and shows that they are all inconsistent with a planar embedding.

Alternatively, it is possible to show that any bridgeless bipartite planar graph with formula_12 vertices and formula_13 edges has formula_14 by combining the Euler formula formula_15 (where formula_16 is the number of faces of a planar embedding) with the observation that the number of faces is at most half the number of edges (the vertices around each face must alternate between houses and utilities, so each face has at least four edges, and each edge belongs to exactly two faces). In the utility graph, formula_17 and formula_18 so in the utility graph it is untrue that formula_14. Because it does not satisfy this inequality, the utility graph cannot be planar.

===Changing the rules===

formula_1 is a toroidal graph, which means that it can be embedded without crossings on a torus, a surface of genus one. These embeddings solve versions of the puzzle in which the houses and companies are drawn on a coffee mug or other such surface instead of a flat plane. There is even enough additional freedom on the torus to solve a version of the puzzle with four houses and four utilities. Similarly, if the three utilities puzzle is presented on a sheet of a transparent material, it may be solved after twisting and gluing the sheet to form a Möbius strip.

Another way of changing the rules of the puzzle that would make it solvable, suggested by Henry Dudeney, is to allow utility lines to pass through other houses or utilities than the ones they connect.

==Properties of the utility graph==
Beyond the utility puzzle, the same graph formula_1 comes up in several other mathematical contexts, including rigidity theory, the classification of cages and well-covered graphs, the study of graph crossing numbers, and the theory of graph minors.

===Rigidity===
The utility graph formula_1 is a Laman graph, meaning that for almost all placements of its vertices in the plane, there is no way to continuously move its vertices while preserving all edge lengths, other than by a rigid motion of the whole plane, and that none of its spanning subgraphs have the same rigidity property. It is the smallest example of a nonplanar Laman graph. Despite being a minimally rigid graph, it has non-rigid embeddings with special placements for its vertices. For general-position embeddings, a polynomial equation describing all possible placements with the same edge lengths has degree 16, meaning that in general there can be at most 16 placements with the same lengths. It is possible to find systems of edge lengths for which up to eight of the solutions to this equation describe realizable placements.

===Other graph-theoretic properties===
formula_1 is a triangle-free graph, in which every vertex has exactly three neighbors (a cubic graph). Among all such graphs, it is the smallest. Therefore, it is the (3,4)-cage, the smallest graph that has three neighbors per vertex and in which the shortest cycle has length four.

Like all other complete bipartite graphs, it is a well-covered graph, meaning that every maximal independent set has the same size. In this graph, the only two maximal independent sets are the two sides of the bipartition, and are of equal sizes. formula_1 is one of only seven 3-regular 3-connected well-covered graphs.

===Generalizations===

Two important characterizations of planar graphs, Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem that the planar graphs are exactly the graphs that contain neither formula_1 nor the complete graph formula_26 as a subdivision, and Wagner&#x27;s theorem that the planar graphs are exactly the graphs that contain neither formula_1 nor formula_26 as a minor, make use of and generalize the non-planarity of formula_1.

Pál Turán&#x27;s &quot;brick factory problem&quot; asks more generally for a formula for the minimum number of crossings in a drawing of the complete bipartite graph formula_30 in terms of the numbers of vertices formula_31 and formula_32 on the two sides of the bipartition. The utility graph formula_1 may be drawn with only one crossing, but not with zero crossings, so its crossing number is one.

<doc id="58863" wikidata="Q200787" url="?curid=58863" title="Gödel's incompleteness theorems">
<text>Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems are two theorems of mathematical logic that are concerned with the limits of in formal axiomatic theories. These results, published by Kurt Gödel in 1931, are important both in mathematical logic and in the philosophy of mathematics. The theorems are widely, but not universally, interpreted as showing that Hilbert&#x27;s program to find a complete and consistent set of axioms for all mathematics is impossible.

The first incompleteness theorem states that no consistent system of axioms whose theorems can be listed by an effective procedure (i.e. an algorithm) is capable of proving all truths about the arithmetic of natural numbers. For any such consistent formal system, there will always be statements about natural numbers that are true, but that are unprovable within the system.

The second incompleteness theorem, an extension of the first, shows that the system cannot demonstrate its own consistency.

Employing a diagonal argument, Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems were the first of several closely related theorems on the limitations of formal systems. They were followed by Tarski&#x27;s undefinability theorem on the formal undefinability of truth, Church&#x27;s proof that Hilbert&#x27;s &quot;Entscheidungsproblem&quot; is unsolvable, and Turing&#x27;s theorem that there is no algorithm to solve the halting problem.

== Formal systems: completeness, consistency, and effective axiomatization ==
The incompleteness theorems apply to formal systems that are of sufficient complexity to express the basic arithmetic of the natural numbers and which are consistent and effectively axiomatized. Particularly in the context of first-order logic, formal systems are also called &quot;formal theories&quot;. In general, a formal system is a deductive apparatus that consists of a particular set of axioms along with rules of symbolic manipulation (or rules of inference) that allow for the derivation of new theorems from the axioms. One example of such a system is first-order Peano arithmetic, a system in which all variables are intended to denote natural numbers. In other systems, such as set theory, only some sentences of the formal system express statements about the natural numbers. The incompleteness theorems are about formal provability &quot;within&quot; these systems, rather than about &quot;provability&quot; in an informal sense.

There are several properties that a formal system may have, including completeness, consistency, and the existence of an effective axiomatization. The incompleteness theorems show that systems which contain a sufficient amount of arithmetic cannot possess all three of these properties.

=== Effective axiomatization ===

A formal system is said to be &quot;effectively axiomatized&quot; (also called &quot;effectively generated&quot;) if its set of theorems is recursively enumerable. This means that there is a computer program that, in principle, could enumerate all the theorems of the system without listing any statements that are not theorems. Examples of effectively generated theories include Peano arithmetic and Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZFC).

The theory known as true arithmetic consists of all true statements about the standard integers in the language of Peano arithmetic. This theory is consistent and complete, and contains a sufficient amount of arithmetic. However, it does not have a recursively enumerable set of axioms, and thus does not satisfy the hypotheses of the incompleteness theorems.

=== Completeness ===

A set of axioms is (&quot;syntactically&quot;, or &quot;negation&quot;-) complete if, for any statement in the axioms&#x27; language, that statement or its negation is provable from the axioms. This is the notion relevant for Gödel&#x27;s first Incompleteness theorem. It is not to be confused with &quot;semantic&quot; completeness, which means that the set of axioms proves all the semantic tautologies of the given language. In his completeness theorem (not to be confused with the incompleteness theorems described here), Gödel proved that first-order logic is &quot;semantically&quot; complete. But it is not syntactically complete, since there are sentences expressible in the language of first-order logic that can be neither proved nor disproved from the axioms of logic alone.

In a system of mathematics, thinkers such as Hilbert believed that it was just a matter of time to find such an axiomatization that would allow one to either prove or disprove (by proving its negation) every mathematical formula.

A formal system might be syntactically incomplete by design, as logics generally are. Or it may be incomplete simply because not all the necessary axioms have been discovered or included. For example, Euclidean geometry without the parallel postulate is incomplete, because some statements in the language (such as the parallel postulate itself) can not be proved from the remaining axioms. Similarly, the theory of dense linear orders is not complete, but becomes complete with an extra axiom stating that there are no endpoints in the order. The continuum hypothesis is a statement in the language of ZFC that is not provable within ZFC, so ZFC is not complete. In this case, there is no obvious candidate for a new axiom that resolves the issue.

The theory of first-order Peano arithmetic seems consistent. Assuming this is indeed the case, note that it has an infinite but recursively enumerable set of axioms, and can encode enough arithmetic for the hypotheses of the incompleteness theorem. Thus by the first incompleteness theorem, Peano Arithmetic is not complete. The theorem gives an explicit example of a statement of arithmetic that is neither provable nor disprovable in Peano&#x27;s arithmetic. Moreover, this statement is true in the usual model. In addition, no effectively axiomatized, consistent extension of Peano arithmetic can be complete.

=== Consistency ===
A set of axioms is (simply) consistent if there is no statement such that both the statement and its negation are provable from the axioms, and &quot;inconsistent&quot; otherwise. That is to say, a consistent axiomatic system is one that is free from contradiction.

Peano arithmetic is provably consistent from ZFC, but not from within itself. Similarly, ZFC is not provably consistent from within itself, but ZFC + &quot;there exists an inaccessible cardinal&quot; proves ZFC is consistent because if is the least such cardinal, then sitting inside the von Neumann universe is a model of ZFC, and a theory is consistent if and only if it has a model.

If one takes all statements in the language of Peano arithmetic as axioms, then this theory is complete, has a recursively enumerable set of axioms, and can describe addition and multiplication. However, it is not consistent.

Additional examples of inconsistent theories arise from the paradoxes that result when the axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension is assumed in set theory.

=== Systems which contain arithmetic ===

The incompleteness theorems apply only to formal systems which are able to prove a sufficient collection of facts about the natural numbers. One sufficient collection is the set of theorems of Robinson arithmetic . Some systems, such as Peano arithmetic, can directly express statements about natural numbers. Others, such as ZFC set theory, are able to interpret statements about natural numbers into their language. Either of these options is appropriate for the incompleteness theorems.

The theory of algebraically closed fields of a given characteristic is complete, consistent, and has an infinite but recursively enumerable set of axioms. However it is not possible to encode the integers into this theory, and the theory cannot describe arithmetic of integers. A similar example is the theory of real closed fields, which is essentially equivalent to Tarski&#x27;s axioms for Euclidean geometry. So Euclidean geometry itself (in Tarski&#x27;s formulation) is an example of a complete, consistent, effectively axiomatized theory.

The system of Presburger arithmetic consists of a set of axioms for the natural numbers with just the addition operation (multiplication is omitted). Presburger arithmetic is complete, consistent, and recursively enumerable and can encode addition but not multiplication of natural numbers, showing that for Gödel&#x27;s theorems one needs the theory to encode not just addition but also multiplication.

 has studied some weak families of arithmetic systems which allow enough arithmetic as relations to formalise Gödel numbering, but which are not strong enough to have multiplication as a function, and so fail to prove the second incompleteness theorem; that is to say, these systems are consistent and capable of proving their own consistency (see self-verifying theories).

=== Conflicting goals ===
In choosing a set of axioms, one goal is to be able to prove as many correct results as possible, without proving any incorrect results. For example, we could imagine a set of true axioms which allow us to prove every true arithmetical claim about the natural numbers . In the standard system of first-order logic, an inconsistent set of axioms will prove every statement in its language (this is sometimes called the principle of explosion), and is thus automatically complete. A set of axioms that is both complete and consistent, however, proves a maximal set of non-contradictory theorems.

The pattern illustrated in the previous sections with Peano arithmetic, ZFC, and ZFC + &quot;there exists an inaccessible cardinal&quot; cannot generally be broken. Here ZFC + &quot;there exists an inaccessible cardinal&quot; cannot from itself, be proved consistent. It is also not complete, as illustrated by the continuum hypothesis, which is unresolvable in ZFC + &quot;there exists an inaccessible cardinal&quot;.

The first incompleteness theorem shows that, in formal systems that can express basic arithmetic, a complete and consistent finite list of axioms can never be created: each time an additional, consistent statement is added as an axiom, there are other true statements that still cannot be proved, even with the new axiom. If an axiom is ever added that makes the system complete, it does so at the cost of making the system inconsistent. It is not even possible for an infinite list of axioms to be complete, consistent, and effectively axiomatized.

== First incompleteness theorem ==

Gödel&#x27;s first incompleteness theorem first appeared as &quot;Theorem VI&quot; in Gödel&#x27;s 1931 paper &quot;On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I&quot;. The hypotheses of the theorem were improved shortly thereafter by using Rosser&#x27;s trick. The resulting theorem (incorporating Rosser&#x27;s improvement) may be paraphrased in English as follows, where &quot;formal system&quot; includes the assumption that the system is effectively generated.

First Incompleteness Theorem: &quot;Any consistent formal system within which a certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be carried out is incomplete; i.e. there are statements of the language of which can neither be proved nor disproved in .&quot; (Raatikainen 2020)

The unprovable statement referred to by the theorem is often referred to as &quot;the Gödel sentence&quot; for the system . The proof constructs a particular Gödel sentence for the system , but there are infinitely many statements in the language of the system that share the same properties, such as the conjunction of the Gödel sentence and any logically valid sentence.

Each effectively generated system has its own Gödel sentence. It is possible to define a larger system  that contains the whole of plus as an additional axiom. This will not result in a complete system, because Gödel&#x27;s theorem will also apply to , and thus also cannot be complete. In this case, is indeed a theorem in , because it is an axiom. Because states only that it is not provable in , no contradiction is presented by its provability within . However, because the incompleteness theorem applies to , there will be a new Gödel statement for , showing that is also incomplete. will differ from in that will refer to , rather than .

=== Syntactic form of the Gödel sentence ===

The Gödel sentence is designed to refer, indirectly, to itself. The sentence states that, when a particular sequence of steps is used to construct another sentence, that constructed sentence will not be provable in . However, the sequence of steps is such that the constructed sentence turns out to be itself. In this way, the Gödel sentence indirectly states its own unprovability within . 

To prove the first incompleteness theorem, Gödel demonstrated that the notion of provability within a system could be expressed purely in terms of arithmetical functions that operate on Gödel numbers of sentences of the system. Therefore, the system, which can prove certain facts about numbers, can also indirectly prove facts about its own statements, provided that it is effectively generated. Questions about the provability of statements within the system are represented as questions about the arithmetical properties of numbers themselves, which would be decidable by the system if it were complete.

Thus, although the Gödel sentence refers indirectly to sentences of the system , when read as an arithmetical statement the Gödel sentence directly refers only to natural numbers. It asserts that no natural number has a particular property, where that property is given by a primitive recursive relation . As such, the Gödel sentence can be written in the language of arithmetic with a simple syntactic form. In particular, it can be expressed as a formula in the language of arithmetic consisting of a number of leading universal quantifiers followed by a quantifier-free body (these formulas are at level formula_1 of the arithmetical hierarchy). Via the MRDP theorem, the Gödel sentence can be re-written as a statement that a particular polynomial in many variables with integer coefficients never takes the value zero when integers are substituted for its variables .

=== Truth of the Gödel sentence ===

The first incompleteness theorem shows that the Gödel sentence of an appropriate formal theory is unprovable in . Because, when interpreted as a statement about arithmetic, this unprovability is exactly what the sentence (indirectly) asserts, the Gödel sentence is, in fact, true (; also see ). For this reason, the sentence is often said to be &quot;true but unprovable.&quot; . However, since the Gödel sentence cannot itself formally specify its intended interpretation, the truth of the sentence may only be arrived at via a meta-analysis from outside the system. In general, this meta-analysis can be carried out within the weak formal system known as primitive recursive arithmetic, which proves the implication , where is a canonical sentence asserting the consistency of (, ).

Although the Gödel sentence of a consistent theory is true as a statement about the intended interpretation of arithmetic, the Gödel sentence will be false in some nonstandard models of arithmetic, as a consequence of Gödel&#x27;s completeness theorem . That theorem shows that, when a sentence is independent of a theory, the theory will have models in which the sentence is true and models in which the sentence is false. As described earlier, the Gödel sentence of a system is an arithmetical statement which claims that no number exists with a particular property. The incompleteness theorem shows that this claim will be independent of the system , and the truth of the Gödel sentence follows from the fact that no standard natural number has the property in question. Any model in which the Gödel sentence is false must contain some element which satisfies the property within that model. Such a model must be &quot;nonstandard&quot; – it must contain elements that do not correspond to any standard natural number (, ).

=== Relationship with the liar paradox ===

Gödel specifically cites Richard&#x27;s paradox and the liar paradox as semantical analogues to his syntactical incompleteness result in the introductory section of &quot;On Formally Undecidable Propositions in Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I&quot;. The liar paradox is the sentence &quot;This sentence is false.&quot; An analysis of the liar sentence shows that it cannot be true (for then, as it asserts, it is false), nor can it be false (for then, it is true). A Gödel sentence for a system makes a similar assertion to the liar sentence, but with truth replaced by provability: says &quot; is not provable in the system .&quot; The analysis of the truth and provability of is a formalized version of the analysis of the truth of the liar sentence.

It is not possible to replace &quot;not provable&quot; with &quot;false&quot; in a Gödel sentence because the predicate &quot; is the Gödel number of a false formula&quot; cannot be represented as a formula of arithmetic. This result, known as Tarski&#x27;s undefinability theorem, was discovered independently both by Gödel, when he was working on the proof of the incompleteness theorem, and by the theorem&#x27;s namesake, Alfred Tarski.

=== Extensions of Gödel&#x27;s original result ===

Compared to the theorems stated in Gödel&#x27;s 1931 paper, many contemporary statements of the incompleteness theorems are more general in two ways. These generalized statements are phrased to apply to a broader class of systems, and they are phrased to incorporate weaker consistency assumptions.

Gödel demonstrated the incompleteness of the system of &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot;, a particular system of arithmetic, but a parallel demonstration could be given for any effective system of a certain expressiveness. Gödel commented on this fact in the introduction to his paper, but restricted the proof to one system for concreteness. In modern statements of the theorem, it is common to state the effectiveness and expressiveness conditions as hypotheses for the incompleteness theorem, so that it is not limited to any particular formal system. The terminology used to state these conditions was not yet developed in 1931 when Gödel published his results.

Gödel&#x27;s original statement and proof of the incompleteness theorem requires the assumption that the system is not just consistent but &quot;ω-consistent&quot;. A system is ω-consistent if it is not ω-inconsistent, and is ω-inconsistent if there is a predicate such that for every specific natural number the system proves , and yet the system also proves that there exists a natural number such that (). That is, the system says that a number with property exists while denying that it has any specific value. The ω-consistency of a system implies its consistency, but consistency does not imply ω-consistency. strengthened the incompleteness theorem by finding a variation of the proof (Rosser&#x27;s trick) that only requires the system to be consistent, rather than ω-consistent. This is mostly of technical interest, because all true formal theories of arithmetic (theories whose axioms are all true statements about natural numbers) are ω-consistent, and thus Gödel&#x27;s theorem as originally stated applies to them. The stronger version of the incompleteness theorem that only assumes consistency, rather than ω-consistency, is now commonly known as Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem and as the Gödel–Rosser theorem.

== Second incompleteness theorem ==

For each formal system containing basic arithmetic, it is possible to canonically define a formula Cons() expressing the consistency of . This formula expresses the property that &quot;there does not exist a natural number coding a formal derivation within the system whose conclusion is a syntactic contradiction.&quot; The syntactic contradiction is often taken to be &quot;0=1&quot;, in which case Cons() states &quot;there is no natural number that codes a derivation of &#x27;0=1&#x27; from the axioms of .&quot;

Gödel&#x27;s second incompleteness theorem shows that, under general assumptions, this canonical consistency statement Cons() will not be provable in . The theorem first appeared as &quot;Theorem XI&quot; in Gödel&#x27;s 1931 paper &quot;On Formally Undecidable Propositions in Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I&quot;. In the following statement, the term &quot;formalized system&quot; also includes an assumption that is effectively axiomatized. This theorem states that for any consistent system &quot;F&quot; within which a certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be carried out, the consistency of &quot;F&quot; cannot be proved in &quot;F&quot; itself. This theorem is stronger than the first incompleteness theorem because the statement constructed in the first incompleteness theorem does not directly express the consistency of the system. The proof of the second incompleteness theorem is obtained by formalizing the proof of the first incompleteness theorem within the system itself.

=== Expressing consistency ===

There is a technical subtlety in the second incompleteness theorem regarding the method of expressing the consistency of as a formula in the language of . There are many ways to express the consistency of a system, and not all of them lead to the same result. The formula Cons() from the second incompleteness theorem is a particular expression of consistency.

Other formalizations of the claim that is consistent may be inequivalent in , and some may even be provable. For example, first-order Peano arithmetic (PA) can prove that &quot;the largest consistent subset of PA&quot; is consistent. But, because PA is consistent, the largest consistent subset of PA is just PA, so in this sense PA &quot;proves that it is consistent&quot;. What PA does not prove is that the largest consistent subset of PA is, in fact, the whole of PA. (The term &quot;largest consistent subset of PA&quot; is meant here to be the largest consistent initial segment of the axioms of PA under some particular effective enumeration.)

=== The Hilbert–Bernays conditions ===

The standard proof of the second incompleteness theorem assumes that the provability predicate satisfies the Hilbert–Bernays provability conditions. Letting represent the Gödel number of a formula , the provability conditions say:

# If proves , then proves .
# proves 1.; that is, proves .
# proves   (analogue of modus ponens).

There are systems, such as Robinson arithmetic, which are strong enough to meet the assumptions of the first incompleteness theorem, but which do not prove the Hilbert–Bernays conditions. Peano arithmetic, however, is strong enough to verify these conditions, as are all theories stronger than Peano arithmetic.

=== Implications for consistency proofs ===

Gödel&#x27;s second incompleteness theorem also implies that a system satisfying the technical conditions outlined above cannot prove the consistency of any system that proves the consistency of . This is because such a system can prove that if proves the consistency of , then is in fact consistent. For the claim that is consistent has form &quot;for all numbers , has the decidable property of not being a code for a proof of contradiction in &quot;. If were in fact inconsistent, then would prove for some that is the code of a contradiction in . But if also proved that is consistent (that is, that there is no such ), then it would itself be inconsistent. This reasoning can be formalized in to show that if is consistent, then is consistent. Since, by second incompleteness theorem, does not prove its consistency, it cannot prove the consistency of either.

This corollary of the second incompleteness theorem shows that there is no hope of proving, for example, the consistency of Peano arithmetic using any finitistic means that can be formalized in a system the consistency of which is provable in Peano arithmetic (PA). For example, the system of primitive recursive arithmetic (PRA), which is widely accepted as an accurate formalization of finitistic mathematics, is provably consistent in PA. Thus PRA cannot prove the consistency of PA. This fact is generally seen to imply that Hilbert&#x27;s program, which aimed to justify the use of &quot;ideal&quot; (infinitistic) mathematical principles in the proofs of &quot;real&quot; (finitistic) mathematical statements by giving a finitistic proof that the ideal principles are consistent, cannot be carried out.

The corollary also indicates the epistemological relevance of the second incompleteness theorem. It would provide no interesting information if a system proved its consistency. This is because inconsistent theories prove everything, including their consistency. Thus a consistency proof of in would give us no clue as to whether is consistent; no doubts about the consistency of would be resolved by such a consistency proof. The interest in consistency proofs lies in the possibility of proving the consistency of a system in some system that is in some sense less doubtful than itself, for example, weaker than . For many naturally occurring theories and , such as = Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory and = primitive recursive arithmetic, the consistency of is provable in , and thus cannot prove the consistency of by the above corollary of the second incompleteness theorem.

The second incompleteness theorem does not rule out altogether the possibility of proving the consistency of a different system with different axioms. For example, Gerhard Gentzen proved the consistency of Peano arithmetic in a different system that includes an axiom asserting that the ordinal called is wellfounded; see Gentzen&#x27;s consistency proof. Gentzen&#x27;s theorem spurred the development of ordinal analysis in proof theory.

== Examples of undecidable statements ==
There are two distinct senses of the word &quot;undecidable&quot; in mathematics and computer science. The first of these is the proof-theoretic sense used in relation to Gödel&#x27;s theorems, that of a statement being neither provable nor refutable in a specified deductive system. The second sense, which will not be discussed here, is used in relation to computability theory and applies not to statements but to decision problems, which are countably infinite sets of questions each requiring a yes or no answer. Such a problem is said to be undecidable if there is no computable function that correctly answers every question in the problem set (see undecidable problem).

Because of the two meanings of the word undecidable, the term independent is sometimes used instead of undecidable for the &quot;neither provable nor refutable&quot; sense.

Undecidability of a statement in a particular deductive system does not, in and of itself, address the question of whether the truth value of the statement is well-defined, or whether it can be determined by other means. Undecidability only implies that the particular deductive system being considered does not prove the truth or falsity of the statement. Whether there exist so-called &quot;absolutely undecidable&quot; statements, whose truth value can never be known or is ill-specified, is a controversial point in the philosophy of mathematics.

The combined work of Gödel and Paul Cohen has given two concrete examples of undecidable statements (in the first sense of the term): The continuum hypothesis can neither be proved nor refuted in ZFC (the standard axiomatization of set theory), and the axiom of choice can neither be proved nor refuted in ZF (which is all the ZFC axioms &quot;except&quot; the axiom of choice). These results do not require the incompleteness theorem. Gödel proved in 1940 that neither of these statements could be disproved in ZF or ZFC set theory. In the 1960s, Cohen proved that neither is provable from ZF, and the continuum hypothesis cannot be proved from ZFC.

 showed that the Whitehead problem in group theory is undecidable, in the first sense of the term, in standard set theory.

Gregory Chaitin produced undecidable statements in algorithmic information theory and proved another incompleteness theorem in that setting. Chaitin&#x27;s incompleteness theorem states that for any system that can represent enough arithmetic, there is an upper bound such that no specific number can be proved in that system to have Kolmogorov complexity greater than . While Gödel&#x27;s theorem is related to the liar paradox, Chaitin&#x27;s result is related to Berry&#x27;s paradox.

=== Undecidable statements provable in larger systems ===

These are natural mathematical equivalents of the Gödel &quot;true but undecidable&quot; sentence. They can be proved in a larger system which is generally accepted as a valid form of reasoning, but are undecidable in a more limited system such as Peano Arithmetic.

In 1977, Paris and Harrington proved that the Paris–Harrington principle, a version of the infinite Ramsey theorem, is undecidable in (first-order) Peano arithmetic, but can be proved in the stronger system of second-order arithmetic. Kirby and Paris later showed that Goodstein&#x27;s theorem, a statement about sequences of natural numbers somewhat simpler than the Paris–Harrington principle, is also undecidable in Peano arithmetic.

Kruskal&#x27;s tree theorem, which has applications in computer science, is also undecidable from Peano arithmetic but provable in set theory. In fact Kruskal&#x27;s tree theorem (or its finite form) is undecidable in a much stronger system ATR0 codifying the principles acceptable based on a philosophy of mathematics called predicativism. The related but more general graph minor theorem (2003) has consequences for computational complexity theory.

== Relationship with computability ==

The incompleteness theorem is closely related to several results about undecidable sets in recursion theory.

 presented a proof of Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem using basic results of computability theory. One such result shows that the halting problem is undecidable: no computer program can correctly determine, given any program as input, whether eventually halts when run with a particular given input. Kleene showed that the existence of a complete effective system of arithmetic with certain consistency properties would force the halting problem to be decidable, a contradiction. This method of proof has also been presented by ; ; and .

 explains how Matiyasevich&#x27;s solution to Hilbert&#x27;s 10th problem can be used to obtain a proof to Gödel&#x27;s first incompleteness theorem. Matiyasevich proved that there is no algorithm that, given a multivariate polynomial with integer coefficients, determines whether there is an integer solution to the equation = 0. Because polynomials with integer coefficients, and integers themselves, are directly expressible in the language of arithmetic, if a multivariate integer polynomial equation = 0 does have a solution in the integers then any sufficiently strong system of arithmetic will prove this. Moreover, suppose the system is ω-consistent. In that case, it will never prove that a particular polynomial equation has a solution when there is no solution in the integers. Thus, if were complete and ω-consistent, it would be possible to determine algorithmically whether a polynomial equation has a solution by merely enumerating proofs of until either &quot; has a solution&quot; or &quot; has no solution&quot; is found, in contradiction to Matiyasevich&#x27;s theorem. Hence it follows that cannot be ω-consistent and complete. Moreover, for each consistent effectively generated system , it is possible to effectively generate a multivariate polynomial over the integers such that the equation = 0 has no solutions over the integers, but the lack of solutions cannot be proved in .

 shows how the existence of recursively inseparable sets can be used to prove the first incompleteness theorem. This proof is often extended to show that systems such as Peano arithmetic are essentially undecidable.

Chaitin&#x27;s incompleteness theorem gives a different method of producing independent sentences, based on Kolmogorov complexity. Like the proof presented by Kleene that was mentioned above, Chaitin&#x27;s theorem only applies to theories with the additional property that all their axioms are true in the standard model of the natural numbers. Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorem is distinguished by its applicability to consistent theories that nonetheless include false statements in the standard model; these theories are known as ω-inconsistent.

== Proof sketch for the first theorem ==
The proof by contradiction has three essential parts. To begin, choose a formal system that meets the proposed criteria:

# Statements in the system can be represented by natural numbers (known as Gödel numbers). The significance of this is that properties of statements—such as their truth and falsehood—will be equivalent to determining whether their Gödel numbers have certain properties, and that properties of the statements can therefore be demonstrated by examining their Gödel numbers. This part culminates in the construction of a formula expressing the idea that &quot;statement is provable in the system&quot; (which can be applied to any statement &quot;&quot; in the system).
# In the formal system it is possible to construct a number whose matching statement, when interpreted, is self-referential and essentially says that it (i.e. the statement itself) is unprovable. This is done using a technique called &quot;diagonalization&quot; (so-called because of its origins as Cantor&#x27;s diagonal argument).
# Within the formal system this statement permits a demonstration that it is neither provable nor disprovable in the system, and therefore the system cannot in fact be ω-consistent. Hence the original assumption that the proposed system met the criteria is false.

=== Arithmetization of syntax ===

The main problem in fleshing out the proof described above is that it seems at first that to construct a statement that is equivalent to &quot; cannot be proved&quot;, would somehow have to contain a reference to , which could easily give rise to an infinite regress. Gödel&#x27;s technique is to show that statements can be matched with numbers (often called the arithmetization of syntax) in such a way that &quot;proving a statement&quot; can be replaced with &quot;testing whether a number has a given property&quot;. This allows a self-referential formula to be constructed in a way that avoids any infinite regress of definitions. The same technique was later used by Alan Turing in his work on the &quot;Entscheidungsproblem&quot;.

In simple terms, a method can be devised so that every formula or statement that can be formulated in the system gets a unique number, called its Gödel number, in such a way that it is possible to mechanically convert back and forth between formulas and Gödel numbers. The numbers involved might be very long indeed (in terms of number of digits), but this is not a barrier; all that matters is that such numbers can be constructed. A simple example is how English can be stored as a sequence of numbers for each letter and then combined into a single larger number:
:* The word codice_1 is encoded as 104-101-108-108-111 in ASCII, which can be converted into the number 104101108108111.
:* The logical statement codice_2 is encoded as 120-061-121-032-061-062-032-121-061-120 in ASCII, which can be converted into the number 120061121032061062032121061120.

In principle, proving a statement true or false can be shown to be equivalent to proving that the number matching the statement does or does not have a given property. Because the formal system is strong enough to support reasoning about &quot;numbers in general&quot;, it can support reasoning about &quot;numbers that represent formulae and statements&quot; as well. Crucially, because the system can support reasoning about &quot;properties of numbers&quot;, the results are equivalent to reasoning about &quot;provability of their equivalent statements&quot;.

=== Construction of a statement about &quot;provability&quot; ===
Having shown that in principle the system can indirectly make statements about provability, by analyzing properties of those numbers representing statements it is now possible to show how to create a statement that actually does this.

A formula that contains exactly one free variable is called a &quot;statement form&quot; or &quot;class-sign&quot;. As soon as is replaced by a specific number, the statement form turns into a &quot;bona fide&quot; statement, and it is then either provable in the system, or not. For certain formulas one can show that for every natural number , is true if and only if it can be proved (the precise requirement in the original proof is weaker, but for the proof sketch this will suffice). In particular, this is true for every specific arithmetic operation between a finite number of natural numbers, such as &quot;23 = 6&quot;.

Statement forms themselves are not statements and therefore cannot be proved or disproved. But every statement form can be assigned a Gödel number denoted by . The choice of the free variable used in the form () is not relevant to the assignment of the Gödel number .

The notion of provability itself can also be encoded by Gödel numbers, in the following way: since a proof is a list of statements which obey certain rules, the Gödel number of a proof can be defined. Now, for every statement , one may ask whether a number is the Gödel number of its proof. The relation between the Gödel number of and , the potential Gödel number of its proof, is an arithmetical relation between two numbers. Therefore, there is a statement form that uses this arithmetical relation to state that a Gödel number of a proof of exists:
: ( is the Gödel number of a formula and is the Gödel number of a proof of the formula encoded by ).

The name Bew is short for &quot;beweisbar&quot;, the German word for &quot;provable&quot;; this name was originally used by Gödel to denote the provability formula just described. Note that &quot; is merely an abbreviation that represents a particular, very long, formula in the original language of ; the string &quot; itself is not claimed to be part of this language.

An important feature of the formula is that if a statement is provable in the system then is also provable. This is because any proof of would have a corresponding Gödel number, the existence of which causes to be satisfied.

=== Diagonalization ===

The next step in the proof is to obtain a statement which, indirectly, asserts its own unprovability. Although Gödel constructed this statement directly, the existence of at least one such statement follows from the diagonal lemma, which says that for any sufficiently strong formal system and any statement form there is a statement such that the system proves
By letting be the negation of , we obtain the theorem
and the defined by this roughly states that its own Gödel number is the Gödel number of an unprovable formula.

The statement is not literally equal to ; rather, states that if a certain calculation is performed, the resulting Gödel number will be that of an unprovable statement. But when this calculation is performed, the resulting Gödel number turns out to be the Gödel number of itself. This is similar to the following sentence in English:
:&quot;, when preceded by itself in quotes, is unprovable.&quot;, when preceded by itself in quotes, is unprovable.
This sentence does not directly refer to itself, but when the stated transformation is made the original sentence is obtained as a result, and thus this sentence indirectly asserts its own unprovability. The proof of the diagonal lemma employs a similar method.

Now, assume that the axiomatic system is ω-consistent, and let be the statement obtained in the previous section.

If were provable, then would be provable, as argued above. But asserts the negation of . Thus the system would be inconsistent, proving both a statement and its negation. This contradiction shows that cannot be provable.

If the negation of were provable, then would be provable (because was constructed to be equivalent to the negation of ). However, for each specific number , cannot be the Gödel number of the proof of , because is not provable (from the previous paragraph). Thus on one hand the system proves there is a number with a certain property (that it is the Gödel number of the proof of ), but on the other hand, for every specific number , we can prove that it does not have this property. This is impossible in an ω-consistent system. Thus the negation of is not provable.

Thus the statement is undecidable in our axiomatic system: it can neither be proved nor disproved within the system.

In fact, to show that is not provable only requires the assumption that the system is consistent. The stronger assumption of ω-consistency is required to show that the negation of is not provable. Thus, if is constructed for a particular system:
*If the system is ω-consistent, it can prove neither nor its negation, and so is undecidable.
*If the system is consistent, it may have the same situation, or it may prove the negation of . In the later case, we have a statement (&quot;not &quot;) which is false but provable, and the system is not ω-consistent.

If one tries to &quot;add the missing axioms&quot; to avoid the incompleteness of the system, then one has to add either or &quot;not &quot; as axioms. But then the definition of &quot;being a Gödel number of a proof&quot; of a statement changes. which means that the formula is now different. Thus when we apply the diagonal lemma to this new Bew, we obtain a new statement , different from the previous one, which will be undecidable in the new system if it is ω-consistent.

=== Proof via Berry&#x27;s paradox ===
 sketches an alternative proof of the first incompleteness theorem that uses Berry&#x27;s paradox rather than the liar paradox to construct a true but unprovable formula. A similar proof method was independently discovered by Saul Kripke. Boolos&#x27;s proof proceeds by constructing, for any computably enumerable set of true sentences of arithmetic, another sentence which is true but not contained in . This gives the first incompleteness theorem as a corollary. According to Boolos, this proof is interesting because it provides a &quot;different sort of reason&quot; for the incompleteness of effective, consistent theories of arithmetic.

=== Computer verified proofs ===
The incompleteness theorems are among a relatively small number of nontrivial theorems that have been transformed into formalized theorems that can be completely verified by proof assistant software. Gödel&#x27;s original proofs of the incompleteness theorems, like most mathematical proofs, were written in natural language intended for human readers.

Computer-verified proofs of versions of the first incompleteness theorem were announced by Natarajan Shankar in 1986 using Nqthm , by Russell O&#x27;Connor in 2003 using Coq and by John Harrison in 2009 using HOL Light . A computer-verified proof of both incompleteness theorems was announced by Lawrence Paulson in 2013 using Isabelle .

== Proof sketch for the second theorem ==
The main difficulty in proving the second incompleteness theorem is to show that various facts about provability used in the proof of the first incompleteness theorem can be formalized within a system using a formal predicate for provability. Once this is done, the second incompleteness theorem follows by formalizing the entire proof of the first incompleteness theorem within the system itself.

Let stand for the undecidable sentence constructed above, and assume for purposes of obtaining a contradiction that the consistency of the system can be proved from within the system itself. This is equivalent to proving the statement &quot;System is consistent&quot;. 
Now consider the statement , where = &quot;If the system is consistent, then is not provable&quot;. The proof of sentence can be formalized within the system , and therefore the statement , &quot; is not provable&quot;, (or identically, &quot;not &quot;) can be proved in the system .

Observe then, that if we can prove that the system is consistent (ie. the statement in the hypothesis of ), then we have proved that is not provable. But this is a contradiction since by the 1st Incompleteness Theorem, this sentence (ie. what is implied in the sentence , &quot;&quot;&quot; is not provable&quot;) is what we construct to be unprovable. Notice that this is why we require formalizing the first Incompleteness Theorem in : to prove the 2nd Incompleteness Theorem, we obtain a contradiction with the 1st Incompleteness Theorem which can do only by showing that the theorem holds in . So we cannot prove that the system is consistent. And the 2nd Incompleteness Theorem statement follows.

== Discussion and implications ==
The incompleteness results affect the philosophy of mathematics, particularly versions of formalism, which use a single system of formal logic to define their principles.

=== Consequences for logicism and Hilbert&#x27;s second problem ===

The incompleteness theorem is sometimes thought to have severe consequences for the program of logicism proposed by Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell, which aimed to define the natural numbers in terms of logic. Bob Hale and Crispin Wright argue that it is not a problem for logicism because the incompleteness theorems apply equally to first-order logic as they do to arithmetic. They argue that only those who believe that the natural numbers are to be defined in terms of first order logic have this problem.

Many logicians believe that Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems struck a fatal blow to David Hilbert&#x27;s second problem, which asked for a finitary consistency proof for mathematics. The second incompleteness theorem, in particular, is often viewed as making the problem impossible. Not all mathematicians agree with this analysis, however, and the status of Hilbert&#x27;s second problem is not yet decided (see &quot;Modern viewpoints on the status of the problem&quot;).

=== Minds and machines ===
Authors including the philosopher J. R. Lucas and physicist Roger Penrose have debated what, if anything, Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems imply about human intelligence. Much of the debate centers on whether the human mind is equivalent to a Turing machine, or by the Church–Turing thesis, any finite machine at all. If it is, and if the machine is consistent, then Gödel&#x27;s incompleteness theorems would apply to it.

 suggested that while Gödel&#x27;s theorems cannot be applied to humans, since they make mistakes and are therefore inconsistent, it may be applied to the human faculty of science or mathematics in general. Assuming that it is consistent, either its consistency cannot be proved or it cannot be represented by a Turing machine.

 has proposed that the concept of mathematical &quot;knowability&quot; should be based on computational complexity rather than logical decidability. He writes that &quot;when &quot;knowability&quot; is interpreted by modern standards, namely via computational complexity, the Gödel phenomena are very much with us.&quot;

Douglas Hofstadter, in his books &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot; and &quot;I Am a Strange Loop&quot;, cites Gödel&#x27;s theorems as an example of what he calls a &quot;strange loop&quot;, a hierarchical, self-referential structure existing within an axiomatic formal system. He argues that this is the same kind of structure that gives rise to consciousness, the sense of &quot;I&quot;, in the human mind. While the self-reference in Gödel&#x27;s theorem comes from the Gödel sentence asserting its unprovability within the formal system of Principia Mathematica, the self-reference in the human mind comes from how the brain abstracts and categorises stimuli into &quot;symbols&quot;, or groups of neurons which respond to concepts, in what is effectively also a formal system, eventually giving rise to symbols modeling the concept of the very entity doing the perception. Hofstadter argues that a strange loop in a sufficiently complex formal system can give rise to a &quot;downward&quot; or &quot;upside-down&quot; causality, a situation in which the normal hierarchy of cause-and-effect is flipped upside-down. In the case of Gödel&#x27;s theorem, this manifests, in short, as the following:
 Merely from knowing the formula&#x27;s meaning, one can infer its truth or falsity without any effort to derive it in the old-fashioned way, which requires one to trudge methodically &quot;upwards&quot; from the axioms. This is not just peculiar; it is astonishing. Normally, one cannot merely look at what a mathematical conjecture says and simply appeal to the content of that statement on its own to deduce whether the statement is true or false. 

In the case of the mind, a far more complex formal system, this &quot;downward causality&quot; manifests, in Hofstadter&#x27;s view, as the ineffable human instinct that the causality of our minds lies on the high level of desires, concepts, personalities, thoughts, and ideas, rather than on the low level of interactions between neurons or even fundamental particles, even though according to physics the latter seems to possess the causal power.
 There is thus a curious upside-downness to our normal human way of perceiving the world: we are built to perceive “big stuff” rather than “small stuff”, even though the domain of the tiny seems to be where the actual motors driving reality reside. 

=== Paraconsistent logic ===

Although Gödel&#x27;s theorems are usually studied in the context of classical logic, they also have a role in the study of paraconsistent logic and of inherently contradictory statements (&quot;dialetheia&quot;). argues that replacing the notion of formal proof in Gödel&#x27;s theorem with the usual notion of informal proof can be used to show that naive mathematics is inconsistent, and uses this as evidence for dialetheism. The cause of this inconsistency is the inclusion of a truth predicate for a system within the language of the system. gives a more mixed appraisal of the applications of Gödel&#x27;s theorems to dialetheism.

=== Appeals to the incompleteness theorems in other fields ===

Appeals and analogies are sometimes made to the incompleteness of theorems in support of arguments that go beyond mathematics and logic. Several authors have commented negatively on such extensions and interpretations, including , , ; and .
 and , for example, quote from Rebecca Goldstein&#x27;s comments on the disparity between Gödel&#x27;s avowed Platonism and the anti-realist uses to which his ideas are sometimes put. criticize Régis Debray&#x27;s invocation of the theorem in the context of sociology; Debray has defended this use as metaphorical (ibid.).

== History ==
After Gödel published his proof of the completeness theorem as his doctoral thesis in 1929, he turned to a second problem for his habilitation. His original goal was to obtain a positive solution to Hilbert&#x27;s second problem. At the time, theories of natural numbers and real numbers similar to second-order arithmetic were known as &quot;analysis&quot;, while theories of natural numbers alone were known as &quot;arithmetic&quot;.

Gödel was not the only person working on the consistency problem. Ackermann had published a flawed consistency proof for analysis in 1925, in which he attempted to use the method of ε-substitution originally developed by Hilbert. Later that year, von Neumann was able to correct the proof for a system of arithmetic without any axioms of induction. By 1928, Ackermann had communicated a modified proof to Bernays; this modified proof led Hilbert to announce his belief in 1929 that the consistency of arithmetic had been demonstrated and that a consistent proof of analysis would likely soon follow. After the publication of the incompleteness theorems showed that Ackermann&#x27;s modified proof must be erroneous, von Neumann produced a concrete example showing that its main technique was unsound.

In the course of his research, Gödel discovered that although a sentence, asserting its falsehood leads to paradox, a sentence that asserts its non-provability does not. In particular, Gödel was aware of the result now called Tarski&#x27;s indefinability theorem, although he never published it. Gödel announced his first incompleteness theorem to Carnap, Feigel, and Waismann on August 26, 1930; all four would attend the Second Conference on the Epistemology of the Exact Sciences, a key conference in Königsberg the following week.

=== Announcement ===
The 1930 Königsberg conference was a joint meeting of three academic societies, with many of the key logicians of the time in attendance. Carnap, Heyting, and von Neumann delivered one-hour addresses on the mathematical philosophies of logicism, intuitionism, and formalism, respectively. The conference also included Hilbert&#x27;s retirement address, as he was leaving his position at the University of Göttingen. Hilbert used the speech to argue his belief that all mathematical problems can be solved. He ended his address by saying,

This speech quickly became known as a summary of Hilbert&#x27;s beliefs on mathematics (its final six words, &quot;Wir müssen wissen. Wir werden wissen!&quot;, were used as Hilbert&#x27;s epitaph in 1943). Although Gödel was likely in attendance for Hilbert&#x27;s address, the two never met face to face.

Gödel announced his first incompleteness theorem at a roundtable discussion session on the third day of the conference. The announcement drew little attention apart from that of von Neumann, who pulled Gödel aside for a conversation. Later that year, working independently with knowledge of the first incompleteness theorem, von Neumann obtained a proof of the second incompleteness theorem, which he announced to Gödel in a letter dated November 20, 1930. Gödel had independently obtained the second incompleteness theorem and included it in his submitted manuscript, which was received by &quot;Monatshefte für Mathematik&quot; on November 17, 1930.

Gödel&#x27;s paper was published in the &quot;Monatshefte&quot; in 1931 under the title &quot;Über formal unentscheidbare Sätze der Principia Mathematica und verwandter Systeme I&quot; (&quot;On Formally Undecidable Propositions in Principia Mathematica and Related Systems I&quot;). As the title implies, Gödel originally planned to publish a second part of the paper in the next volume of the &quot;Monatshefte&quot;; the prompt acceptance of the first paper was one reason he changed his plans.

=== Generalization and acceptance ===

Gödel gave a series of lectures on his theorems at Princeton in 1933–1934 to an audience that included Church, Kleene, and Rosser. By this time, Gödel had grasped that the key property his theorems required is that the system must be effective (at the time, the term &quot;general recursive&quot; was used). Rosser proved in 1936 that the hypothesis of ω-consistency, which was an integral part of Gödel&#x27;s original proof, could be replaced by simple consistency if the Gödel sentence was changed appropriately. These developments left the incompleteness theorems in essentially their modern form.

Gentzen published his consistency proof for first-order arithmetic in 1936. Hilbert accepted this proof as &quot;finitary&quot; although (as Gödel&#x27;s theorem had already shown) it cannot be formalized within the system of arithmetic that is being proved consistent.

The impact of the incompleteness theorems on Hilbert&#x27;s program was quickly realized. Bernays included a full proof of the incompleteness theorems in the second volume of &quot;Grundlagen der Mathematik&quot; (1939), along with additional results of Ackermann on the ε-substitution method and Gentzen&#x27;s consistency proof of arithmetic. This was the first full published proof of the second incompleteness theorem.

=== Criticisms ===

==== Finsler ====
 used a version of Richard&#x27;s paradox to construct an expression that was false but unprovable in a particular, informal framework he had developed. Gödel was unaware of this paper when he proved the incompleteness theorems (Collected Works Vol. IV., p. 9). Finsler wrote to Gödel in 1931 to inform him about this paper, which Finsler felt had priority for an incompleteness theorem. Finsler&#x27;s methods did not rely on formalized provability and had only a superficial resemblance to Gödel&#x27;s work. Gödel read the paper but found it deeply flawed, and his response to Finsler laid out concerns about the lack of formalization. Finsler continued to argue for his philosophy of mathematics, which eschewed formalization, for the remainder of his career.

==== Zermelo ====

In September 1931, Ernst Zermelo wrote to Gödel to announce what he described as an &quot;essential gap&quot; in Gödel&#x27;s argument. In October, Gödel replied with a 10-page letter, where he pointed out that Zermelo mistakenly assumed that the notion of truth in a system is definable in that system; it is not true in general by Tarski&#x27;s undefinability theorem. However, Zermelo did not relent and published his criticisms in print with &quot;a rather scathing paragraph on his young competitor&quot;. Gödel decided that pursuing the matter further was pointless, and Carnap agreed. Much of Zermelo&#x27;s subsequent work was related to logic stronger than first-order logic, with which he hoped to show both the consistency and categoricity of mathematical theories.

==== Wittgenstein ====
Ludwig Wittgenstein wrote several passages about the incompleteness theorems that were published posthumously in his 1953 &quot;Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics&quot;, particularly, one section sometimes called the &quot;notorious paragraph&quot; where he seems to confuse the notions of &quot;true&quot; and &quot;provable&quot; in Russell&#x27;s system. Gödel was a member of the Vienna Circle during the period in which Wittgenstein&#x27;s early ideal language philosophy and Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus dominated the circle&#x27;s thinking. There has been some controversy about whether Wittgenstein misunderstood the incompleteness theorem or just expressed himself unclearly. Writings in Gödel&#x27;s Nachlass express the belief that Wittgenstein misread his ideas.

Multiple commentators have read Wittgenstein as misunderstanding Gödel, although as well as have provided textual readings arguing that most commentary misunderstands Wittgenstein. On their release, Bernays, Dummett, and Kreisel wrote separate reviews on Wittgenstein&#x27;s remarks, all of which were extremely negative. The unanimity of this criticism caused Wittgenstein&#x27;s remarks on the incompleteness theorems to have little impact on the logic community. In 1972, Gödel stated: &quot;Has Wittgenstein lost his mind? Does he mean it seriously? He intentionally utters trivially nonsensical statements&quot;, and wrote to Karl Menger that Wittgenstein&#x27;s comments demonstrate a misunderstanding of the incompleteness theorems writing:

 It is clear from the passages you cite that Wittgenstein did &quot;not&quot; understand [the first incompleteness theorem] (or pretended not to understand it). He interpreted it as a kind of logical paradox, while in fact is just the opposite, namely a mathematical theorem within an absolutely uncontroversial part of mathematics (finitary number theory or combinatorics). 

Since the publication of Wittgenstein&#x27;s &quot;Nachlass&quot; in 2000, a series of papers in philosophy have sought to evaluate whether the original criticism of Wittgenstein&#x27;s remarks was justified. argue that Wittgenstein had a more complete understanding of the incompleteness theorem than was previously assumed. They are particularly concerned with the interpretation of a Gödel sentence for an ω-inconsistent system as saying &quot;I am not provable&quot;, since the system has no models in which the provability predicate corresponds to actual provability. argues that their interpretation of Wittgenstein is not historically justified. explores the relationship between Wittgenstein&#x27;s writing and theories of paraconsistent logic.

=== Translations, during his lifetime, of Gödel&#x27;s paper into English ===
None of the following agree in all translated words and in typography. The typography is a serious matter, because Gödel expressly wished to emphasize &quot;those metamathematical notions that had been defined in their usual sense before . . .&quot; . Three translations exist. Of the first John Dawson states that: &quot;The Meltzer translation was seriously deficient and received a devastating review in the &quot;Journal of Symbolic Logic&quot;; &quot;Gödel also complained about Braithwaite&#x27;s commentary . &quot;Fortunately, the Meltzer translation was soon supplanted by a better one prepared by Elliott Mendelson for Martin Davis&#x27;s anthology &quot;The Undecidable&quot; . . . he found the translation &quot;not quite so good&quot; as he had expected . . . [but because of time constraints he] agreed to its publication&quot; (ibid). (In a footnote Dawson states that &quot;he would regret his compliance, for the published volume was marred throughout by sloppy typography and numerous misprints&quot; (ibid)). Dawson states that &quot;The translation that Gödel favored was that by Jean van Heijenoort&quot; (ibid). For the serious student another version exists as a set of lecture notes recorded by Stephen Kleene and J. B. Rosser &quot;during lectures given by Gödel at to the Institute for Advanced Study during the spring of 1934&quot; (cf commentary by and beginning on p. 41); this version is titled &quot;On Undecidable Propositions of Formal Mathematical Systems&quot;. In their order of publication:
* B. Meltzer (translation) and R. B. Braithwaite (Introduction), 1962. &quot;On Formally Undecidable Propositions of Principia Mathematica and Related Systems&quot;, Dover Publications, New York (Dover edition 1992), (pbk.) This contains a useful translation of Gödel&#x27;s German abbreviations on pp. 33–34. As noted above, typography, translation and commentary is suspect. Unfortunately, this translation was reprinted with all its suspect content by
:* Stephen Hawking editor, 2005. &quot;God Created the Integers: The Mathematical Breakthroughs That Changed History&quot;, Running Press, Philadelphia, . Gödel&#x27;s paper appears starting on p. 1097, with Hawking&#x27;s commentary starting on p. 1089.
* Martin Davis editor, 1965. &quot;The Undecidable: Basic Papers on Undecidable Propositions, Unsolvable problems and Computable Functions&quot;, Raven Press, New York, no ISBN. Gödel&#x27;s paper begins on page 5, preceded by one page of commentary.
* Jean van Heijenoort editor, 1967, 3rd edition 1967. &quot;From Frege to Gödel: A Source Book in Mathematical Logic, 1879-1931&quot;, Harvard University Press, Cambridge Mass., (pbk). van Heijenoort did the translation. He states that &quot;Professor Gödel approved the translation, which in many places was accommodated to his wishes.&quot; (p. 595). Gödel&#x27;s paper begins on p. 595; van Heijenoort&#x27;s commentary begins on p. 592.
* Martin Davis editor, 1965, ibid. &quot;On Undecidable Propositions of Formal Mathematical Systems.&quot; A copy with Gödel&#x27;s corrections of errata and Gödel&#x27;s added notes begins on page 41, preceded by two pages of Davis&#x27;s commentary. Until Davis included this in his volume this lecture existed only as mimeographed notes.
