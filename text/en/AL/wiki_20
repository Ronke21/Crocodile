<text>Dreamland is an unincorporated community on Copper Island (the Keweenaw Peninsula), in Torch Lake Township, Houghton County, in the Upper Peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan. It has been described as being a &quot;district of Bootjack&quot; or in Bootjack, but it is a separate town. The town consists almost entirely of the Dreamland Inn (sometimes called the Dreamland Bar &amp; Restaurant, Dreamland Hotel or &quot;Dreamland Hotel and bar;&quot; it is often referred to as being in Lake Linden—due to that being its mailing address) and some docks on Torch Bay.

==History==
Dreamland was founded in 1913 with the building of the resort (containing a bar and hotel rooms often frequented by loggers unable to make it home in the winter) by Norbert Sarazin. A dance pavilion, originally quite a local attraction, burned in 1921 and Prohibition caused the closing of the bar; it reopened in 1947.

Logging was formerly the main industry in the town.

==Geography==

===Climate===
Dreamland has a humid continental climate but winters are typically long and snowy with much lake effect snow.

<text>Margo Howard (née Lederer; born March 15, 1940) is an American writer and former advice columnist. She is the only child of businessman/innovator Jules Lederer and Eppie Lederer (better known as Ann Landers after her long-time advice column &quot;Ask Ann Landers&quot;), the niece of Pauline Phillips, and the cousin of Jeanne Phillips (the latter two both better known as Abigail Van Buren and authors of the advice column &quot;Dear Abby&quot;).

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Howard was born in Sioux City, Iowa, to Eppie (née Esther Pauline Friedman) and Jules Lederer, a businessman and eventually the founder of Budget-Rent-A-Car International. She attended Brandeis University but dropped out to marry, after which she worked at the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;, and wrote for &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;People&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, and &quot;Boston Magazine&quot;. She wrote a syndicated social commentary column, &quot;Margo&quot;, in the 1970s.

===Career===
For eight years, Howard wrote the &quot;Dear Prudence&quot; column featured in &quot;Slate&quot; magazine. &quot;Dear Prudence&quot; also was featured on National Public Radio and syndicated in more than 200 newspapers. In February 2006, she left the &quot;Dear Prudence&quot; column, and began writing a &quot;Dear Margo&quot; column for Yahoo, then for Women on the Web (wowowow.com) through Creators Syndicate. On May 11, 2013, Howard ended the &quot;Dear Margo&quot; column, announcing that she was retiring from writing on a deadline and saying, &quot;I plan to write long-form pieces as the spirit moves me&quot;.

Her aunt, Pauline Esther Friedman &quot;Popo&quot; Phillips, wrote the &quot;Dear Abby&quot; column. Although her mother and aunt were twin sisters, and close while growing up, an intense rivalry developed between them because of their columns. In an echo of that rivalry, Howard and her aunt never got along, and she has had public differences with her cousin Jeanne Phillips, who took over the &quot;Dear Abby&quot; column when her mother died.

In 2014, Howard published &quot;Eat, Drink, and Remarry: Confessions of a Serial Wife&quot;, reminisces of her four marriages.

===Marriages and family===
Howard has been married four times: first to John Coleman (1962–1967); second to Jules Furth (1971–1976); third to the actor Ken Howard (1977–1991); fourth (and currently) to Ronald Weintraub, a Boston cardiac surgeon. After her divorce from Howard, she retained the surname for professional use.

Howard has three children by Coleman: two daughters, Abra and Andrea, and a son, Adam Coleman Howard, who is an actor and director.

<doc id="59194" wikidata="Q555723" url="?curid=59194" title="Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington">
<text>Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington and 4th Earl of Cork (25 April 1694 – 4 December 1753) was a British architect and noble often called the &quot;Apollo of the Arts&quot; and the &quot;Architect Earl&quot;. The son of the 2nd Earl of Burlington and 3rd Earl of Cork, Burlington never took more than a passing interest in politics despite his position as a Privy Counsellor and a member of both the British House of Lords and the Irish House of Lords. His great interests in life were architecture and landscaping, and he is remembered for being a builder and a patron of architects, craftsmen and landscapers, Indeed, he is credited with bringing Palladian architecture to Britain and Ireland. His major projects include Burlington House, Westminster School, Chiswick House and Northwick Park.

==Life==
Lord Burlington was born in Yorkshire into a wealthy Anglo-Irish aristocratic family, the only son of Charles Boyle, 2nd Earl of Burlington and his wife, Juliana Boyle ( Noel; 1672–1750). He succeeded to his titles and extensive estates in Yorkshire and Ireland at the age of nine, after his father&#x27;s death in February 1704. During his minority, which lasted until 1715, his English and Irish lands, as also his political interests and patronages, were managed by his mother.

Burlington showed a fondness for music at an early age. Georg Frideric Handel dedicated two operas to Burlington while staying at his residence Burlington House: &quot;Teseo&quot; and &quot;Amadigi di Gaula&quot;. According to Hawkins, Francesco Barsanti dedicated the six recorder sonatas of his Op. 1 to Lord Burlington, although the dedication must have appeared on the edition sold by Peter Bressan, before Walsh &amp; Hare engraved the works c. 1727.

Three foreign Grand Tours taken between 1714 and 1719, and a further trip to Paris in 1726, gave him opportunities to develop his taste. His professional skill as an architect (always supported by a mason-contractor) was extraordinary in an English aristocrat. He carried his copy of Andrea Palladio&#x27;s book &quot;I quattro libri dell&#x27;architettura&quot; with him when touring the Veneto in 1719, but made notes on a number of blank pages, having found the region flooded and many villas inaccessible. It was on this tour that he acquired the passion for Palladian architecture. In 1719, he was one of the main subscribers of the Royal Academy of Music, a corporation that produced baroque opera on stage.

Lord Burlington&#x27;s first project, appropriately, was one of his own London residences, Burlington House, where he dismissed his baroque architect James Gibbs when he returned from the continent in 1719, and employed the Scottish architect Colen Campbell, with the history-painter-turned-designer William Kent assigned for the interiors. The courtyard front of Burlington House, prominently sited in Piccadilly, was the first major executed statement of Neo-Palladianism.

In the 1720s, Burlington and Campbell parted, and Burlington was assisted in his projects by the young Henry Flitcroft (&quot;Burlington Harry&quot;), who developed into a major architect of the second Neo-Palladian generation, Daniel Garrett, a straightforward Palladian architect of the second rank, and some draughtsmen.

Lord Burlington never closely inspected Roman ruins or made detailed drawings on the sites; he relied on Palladio and Scamozzi as his interpreters of the classic tradition to do so. Burlington&#x27;s Palladio drawings include many reconstructions of Vitruvius&#x27; Roman buildings, which he planned to publish. In the meantime, he adapted the palazzo facade in the illustration for the London house of General Wade at Old Burlington Street in 1723, which was published for &quot;Vitruvius Britannicus&quot; iii (1725). 

This publication put a previously unknown Palladio design into circulation. Another source of his inspiration were drawings he collected, some drawings of Palladio himself which had belonged to Inigo Jones, and many more of Inigo Jones&#x27; pupil John Webb, which William Kent published in 1727 (although a date of 1736 is generally accepted) as &quot;Some Designs of Mr Inigo Jones&quot;... with some additional designs that were by Kent and Burlington. The important role of Jones&#x27; pupil Webb in transmitting the palladian-neo-palladian heritage was not understood until the 20th century. 

By the early 1730s, Palladian style had triumphed as the generally accepted manner for a British country house or public building. For the rest of his life, Lord Burlington was &quot;the Apollo of the arts&quot; as Horace Walpole phrased it— and Kent, &quot;his proper priest.&quot;

In 1731, Alexander Pope, who had been a friend of Burlington since about 1715, addressed the first of his &quot;Moral Essays&quot; to him, on the subject &quot;Of False Taste&quot;. This described good taste in specific interests of his, such as landscaping, gardens and architecture.

In 1739, Lord Burlington was involved in the founding of a new charitable organisation called the Foundling Hospital. Burlington was a governor of the charity, but did not formally take part in planning the construction of this large Bloomsbury children&#x27;s home, completed in 1742. The architect for the building was a Theodore Jacobsen, who took on the commission as an act of charity.

Many of Lord Burlington&#x27;s projects have suffered from rebuilding or additions, from fire, or from losses due to urban sprawl. In many cases, his ideas were informal: at Holkham Hall, the architect Matthew Brettingham recalled that &quot;the general ideas were first struck out by the Earl of Burlington and the Earl of Leicester, assisted by Mr. William Kent.&quot; Brettingham&#x27;s engraved publication of Holkham credited Burlington specifically with the ceilings for the portico and the north dressing room.

Lord Burlington&#x27;s architectural drawings, inherited by his son-in-law, William Cavendish, 4th Duke of Devonshire, are preserved at Chatsworth House, and enable attributions that would not otherwise be possible. In 1751, he sent some of his drawings to Francesco Algarotti in Potsdam, together with a book on Vitruvius.

==Major projects==
* Burlington House, Piccadilly, London: Lord Burlington&#x27;s own contribution to the house is likely to have been restricted to the former colonnade (demolished 1868) of the building. A monumental screening gateway to Piccadilly was built and the principle interiors of the house were reconstructed with typical Palladian features. In London, Burlington offered designs for features at several aristocratic free-standing dwellings, none of which have survived: Queensbury House in Burlington Gardens (a gateway); Warwick House, Warwick Street (interiors); Richmond House, Whitehall (the main building).
* Tottenham House, Wiltshire, for his brother-in-law, Charles Bruce, 3rd Earl of Ailesbury: Built from 1721, executed by Lord Burlington&#x27;s protégé Henry Flitcroft (enlarged and remodelled since). In the original house, the high corner pavilion blocks of Inigo Jones&#x27; Wilton House were provided with the &quot;Palladian window&quot; motif to be seen at Burlington House. Burlington, with a good eye for garden effects, also designed the ornamental buildings in the park (now demolished).
* Westminster School, the Dormitory: Built between 1722 – 1730 (altered, bombed, and restored), the first public work by Lord Burlington, for which Sir Christopher Wren had provided a design which was rejected in favor of Burlington&#x27;s, exhibited as a triumph for the Palladians and a sign of changing English taste.
* Old Burlington Street, London: Houses, including one for General Wade which was built in 1723 (demolished). General Wade&#x27;s house rendered the genuine Palladio facade in Lord Burlington&#x27;s collection of drawings.
* Waldershare Park, Kent, the Belvedere Tower: Built between 1725 – 27. A design for an eye-catcher garden that might have been attributed to Colen Campbell were it not have been for a ground plan found among Lord Burlington&#x27;s drawings at Chatsworth House.
* Chiswick House Villa, Middlesex: The &quot;Casina&quot; in the gardens, constructed in 1717, was Lord Burlington&#x27;s first essay. The villa, built between 1727 and 1729, is considered to be the finest remaining example of Neo-Palladain architecture in London and one of the gems of European 18th-century architecture. An attempt made by Burlington to create a Roman villa situated in a symbolic Roman garden. He built the villa with enough space to house his art collection, regarded as containing &quot;some of the best pictures in Europe&quot;, and his more select pieces of furniture, some of which was purchased on his first Grand Tour of Europe in 1714. 
*Sevenoaks School, School House: Built in 1730. The school depicts classic Palladian work, commissioned by Lord Burlington&#x27;s friend Elijah Fenton.
* The York Assembly Rooms: Built between 1731 – 32 (facade remodelled). In the basilica-like space, Lord Burlington attempted an archaeological reconstruction &quot;with doctrinaire exactitude&quot; (Colvin 1995) of the &quot;Egyptian Hall&quot; described by Vitruvius, as it had been interpreted in Palladio&#x27;s &quot;Quattro Libri.&quot; The result was one of the grandest Palladian public spaces.
* Castle Hill, Devonshire.
* Northwick Park, Gloucestershire.
* Kirby Hall, Yorkshire (an elevation).

==Marriage and children==

Burlington married Lady Dorothy Savile on 21 March 1720, the daughter of William Savile, 2nd Marquess of Halifax and his second wife, Lady Mary Finch.

Mary was the daughter of Daniel Finch, 2nd Earl of Nottingham and Lady Essex Rich (died 1684). Essex was the daughter of Robert Rich, 3rd Earl of Warwick, and Anne Cheeke. Anne was the daughter of Sir Thomas Cheeke of Pirgo and an earlier Lady Essex Rich (died 1659). This Lady Essex was the daughter of Robert Rich, 1st Earl of Warwick and Lady Penelope Devereux. Essex was probably named after her maternal grandfather Walter Devereux, 1st Earl of Essex. Her maternal grandmother was Lettice Knollys.

They had three daughters:
* Lady Dorothy Boyle (14 May 1724 – 2 May 1742). She was married to George FitzRoy, Earl of Euston, second son of Charles FitzRoy, 2nd Duke of Grafton and Lady Henrietta Somerset. No known descendants.
* Lady Julianna Boyle (1727–1730).
* Lady Charlotte Elizabeth Boyle (27 October 1731 – 8 December 1754). She married William Cavendish, Marquess of Hartington (later Duke of Devonshire after her death). They were parents to William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire, George Cavendish, 1st Earl of Burlington, and two other children.

Burlington died at Chiswick House, aged 59. Upon his death, the Earldom of Cork passed to a cousin, John Boyle, and the title of the Earl of Burlington became extinct. It was recreated in 1831 for his grandson, George Cavendish, and is now held by the Cavendish family as a courtesy title for the Dukes of Devonshire.

<doc id="59195" wikidata="Q752760" url="?curid=59195" title="Royal Welch Fusiliers">
<text>The Royal Welch Fusiliers () was a line infantry regiment of the British Army, and part of the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Division, that was founded in 1689; shortly after the Glorious Revolution. In 1702, it was designated a fusilier regiment and became the Welch Regiment of Fusiliers; the prefix &quot;Royal&quot; was added in 1713, then confirmed in 1714 when George I named it the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own Royal Regiment of Welsh Fusiliers. In 1751, after reforms that standardised the naming and numbering of regiments, it became the 23rd Regiment of Foot (Royal Welsh Fuzileers). In 1881, the final title of the regiment was adopted.

It retained the archaic spelling of &quot;Welch&quot;, instead of &quot;Welsh&quot;, and &quot;Fuzileers&quot; for &quot;Fusiliers&quot;; these were engraved on swords carried by regimental officers during the Napoleonic Wars. After the 1881 Childers Reforms, normal spelling was used officially, but &quot;Welch&quot; continued to be used informally until restored in 1920 by Army Order No.56.

It should not be confused with the Welch Regiment, a different unit (formed in 1881 from the 41st and 69th) which recruited in South and West, rather than North Wales, and became part of the Royal Regiment of Wales or RRW in 1969.

One of the few regiments to retain its original title, in March 2006 the Royal Welch Fusiliers was amalgamated with the RRW and became 1st Battalion, Royal Welsh, with RRW as the 2nd Battalion.

==History==
===Formation; 1689 to 1773===
The regiment was raised by Henry Herbert at Ludlow on 16 March 1689, following the 1688 Glorious Revolution and exile of James II. It served throughout the 1689 to 1691 Williamite War in Ireland, including the Battle of the Boyne in July 1690, and the Battle of Aughrim in 1691 which brought the campaign to an end. It joined Allied forces fighting in the Nine Years War and at Namur in August 1695, took part in the attack on the Terra Nova earthwork that inspired the song &#x27;The British Grenadiers.&#x27;

On the outbreak of the War of the Spanish Succession in 1702, it became the Welch Regiment of Fuzilieers; this denoted units equipped with light-weight muskets or &#x27;fusils&#x27; used to protect the artillery, although the distinction later became obsolete. It served throughout Marlborough&#x27;s campaigns in the Low Countries, including the battles of Schellenberg, Blenheim and Ramillies.

In 1714, George I gave it the title of the Prince of Wales&#x27;s Own Royal Regiment of Welsh Fusiliers. The next 28 years were spent on garrison duty in England and Scotland, until it returned to Flanders in 1742 for the War of the Austrian Succession. At Dettingen in June 1743, it rallied after being driven back by the elite French Maison du Roi cavalry; its steadiness was a major contribution to what is considered a fortunate victory. It incurred 323 casualties at Fontenoy in May 1745, before a brief period in Scotland during the 1745 Rising. Over 240 members of the regiment were lost at Lauffeld in July 1747, a defeat that led to the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.

Following the 1751 reforms that standardised naming and numbering of regiments, it became the 23rd Regiment of Foot (Royal Welsh Fuzileers). In the opening battle of the Seven Years&#x27; War, it was part of the Minorca garrison that surrendered to the French in June 1756; given free passage to Gibraltar, from 1758 it campaigned in Germany. At Minden in August 1759, it was one of the infantry units that routed the French cavalry, an achievement still celebrated as Minden Day by their successor unit, the Royal Welsh. Between 1760 and 1762, it fought in the battles of Warburg, Kloster Kampen 1760 and Wilhelmsthal in June 1762, before the war ended with the 1763 Treaty of Paris.

When the American Revolutionary War began in 1773, the regiment was posted to North America. The light infantry and grenadier companies took heavy losses at the Battle of Bunker Hill in June 1775; it participated in nearly every campaign up to the Siege of Yorktown in September 1781. At Yorktown, it was the only British regiment not to surrender its colours, which were smuggled out by a junior officer.

In the early stages of the French Revolutionary Wars, it was posted to the West Indies in 1794 and participated in the 1795 capture of Port-au-Prince before returning home in 1796. As part of the expeditionary force assigned to the 1799 Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland, it fought at Alkmaar in October 1799.
===19th century===

Apart from Egypt and the Battle of Alexandria in 1801 and the Invasion of Martinique in 1809 the regiment saw little action in the Napoleonic Wars until being sent to the Peninsula in 1810. Between 1811 and 1814, it fought in many of Wellington&#x27;s actions, including the battles of Albuera, Badajoz, Salamanca, Nivelle and Toulouse. At the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815, it was part of Lieutenant Colonel Hugh Mitchell&#x27;s 4th Brigade in the 4th Infantry Division.

In the nineteenth century, the regiment took part in the Crimean War, the Second Opium War, the Indian Mutiny and the Third Anglo-Burmese War.

The Cardwell Reforms of 1872 linked most infantry regiments in pairs, but because the 23rd already had two battalions it was unaffected. Cardwell also introduced &#x27;Localisation of the Forces&#x27;, which established permanent regimental depots in county towns and brigaded the regular regiments with their local Militia and Volunteer battalions. For the 23rd, this included:
* 23rd Brigade Depot at Hightown Barracks in Wrexham from 1873
* Royal Anglesey Light Infantry – &quot;converted to Engineers in 1877&quot;
* Royal Flint Rifles
* Royal Denbigh and Merioneth Rifles
* Royal Carnarvon Rifles
* 1st Administrative Battalion, Denbighshire Rifle Volunteers
* 1st Administrative Battalion, Flintshire &amp; Carnarvonshire Rifle Volunteers

The Childers Reforms of 1881 took Cardwell&#x27;s reforms further. The regiments were given names rather than numbers the regiment officially became The Royal Welsh Fusiliers on 1 July 1881, although &quot;Welch&quot; was used informally until restored in 1920 by Army Order No.56. The depot became the 23rd Regimental District depot, and the militia and volunteers became numbered battalions of their linked regiment (though the Royal Flint Rifles joined the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps): 
* 3rd (Royal Denbigh and Merioneth Militia) Battalion – &quot;3rd (Royal Denbigh and Flint Militia) Battalion from 1889&quot;
* 4th (Royal Carnarvon Militia) Battalion – &quot;4th (Royal Carnarvon and Merioneth Militia) Battalion from 1889&quot;
* 1st Volunteer Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers – &quot;from 1st Denbighshire Volunteers&quot;&#x27;
* 2nd Volunteer Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers – &quot;from 1st Flintshire &amp; Carnarvon Volunteers&quot;&#x27;
* 3rd Volunteer Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers – &quot;formed in 1897 from the Carnarvonshire companies of the 2nd VB&quot;

The 1st battalion served in the 1899 to 1902 Second Boer War; and returned home from South Africa on the SS &quot;Ortona&quot; in January 1903.

The 2nd battalion was stationed at Hong Kong from 1898 to 1902, and served in the multinational force involved in the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900. They fought alongside the United States Marine Corps (see pages 32–33 in official USMC paper published in 1995). They transferred to India in October 1902, and were stationed at Chakrata.

===20th century===
The Haldane Reforms of 1908 converted the remaining Militia into the Special Reserve (SR) and the Volunteers into the Territorial Force (TF). The battalions were now numbered sequentially within their regiment. The TF battalions of the RWF were given subtitles in 1909:
* 3rd (Reserve) Battalion (SR) at Poyser Street in Wrexham
* 4th (Denbighshire) Battalion (TF) at Poyser Street, Wrexham
* 5th (Flintshire) Battalion (TF) at Castle Precinct in Flint (since demolished)
* 6th (Carnarvonshire &amp; Anglesey) Battalion (TF) at Caernarfon Barracks in Caernarfon
* 7th (Merionethshire and Montgomeryshire) Battalion (TF) at Back Lane Drill Hall in Newtown, Montgomeryshire – &quot;transferred from the South Wales Borderers&quot;

The four TF Battalions constituted the North Wales Brigade in the Welsh Division.

====First World War; Regular Army====
The 1st and 2nd battalions served on the Western Front from 1914 to 1918 and took part in some of the hardest fighting of the war, including Mametz Wood in 1916 and Passchendaele or Third Ypres in 1917. Claims in 2008 they participated in the semi-mythical Christmas 1914 Football Game with the Germans have since been disproved.

A number of writers fought with the regiment in France and recorded their experiences; David Thomas (killed 1916), Robert Graves and Siegfried Sassoon all served with the 1st Battalion. John Bernard Pye Adams, a captain with the 1st Battalion, was wounded in 1916, and while on medical leave, wrote &quot;Nothing of Importance&quot;, his recollections of trench life. Adams did not live to see its publication — after returning to the front in January 1917, he died in action a month later. His book, published a few months after his death, was the only memoir of trench experiences published in Great Britain during the war and was well received by both &quot;The Times&quot; and the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;.

J C Dunn, a medical officer with the 2nd Battalion who had also served in the 1899–1902 Boer War, published &quot;The War the Infantry Knew&quot; in 1931. A collection of letters and diary entries from over 50 individuals, it is considered a classic by military historians for its treatment of daily life and death in the trenches.

&quot;Good-Bye to All That&quot; by Robert Graves was first published in 1929 and has never been out of print; in one anecdote, he records the Regimental Goat Major being charged with &#x27;prostituting the Royal Goat&#x27; in return for a stud fee. Graves also edited &quot;Old Soldiers Never Die&quot;, published in 1933; a rare example of the war seen by an ordinary soldier, it was written by Frank Richards, a pre-war regular recalled in 1914, who served on the Western Front until the end of the war. The poets David Jones and Hedd Wyn, killed at Passchendaele in 1917, were members of Kitchener battalions.

====First World War; Territorial and War Service====
The TF battalions raised 2nd and 3rd Line battalions; in addition, the regiment raised over a dozen &#x27;war service&#x27; battalions, informally known as Kitchener or Pals battalions.

The 4th (Denbighshire) Battalion was one of the first TF units to see active service, landing in France in November 1914, where it remained until January 1919. Between 1915 and 1918, another ten Royal Welch Kitchener battalions also fought on the Western Front, including the battles of Loos, the Somme and Passchendaele; a number of these were disbanded in early 1918 due to manpower shortages. The poets David Jones and Hedd Wyn served with The 11th (Service) Battalion landed in Salonika in November 1915, where it remained for the duration of the war.

The 5th, 6th, 7th Territorial battalions fought at Gallipoli as part of the 53rd (Welsh) Division; by January 1916, it contained 162 officers and 2,428 men, approximately 15% of full strength. The 8th Kitchener Battalion was also at Gallipoli as part of 13th (Western) Division. They remained in the Middle East until the end of the war, the 53rd (Welsh) taking part in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign and the 13th (Western) in the Mesopotamian campaign.

====Interwar====
The TF was reformed in 1920 and reorganised as the Territorial Army (TA) the following year. In 1938 the 5th (Flintshire) Battalion was converted into 60th (Royal Welch Fusiliers) Anti-Tank Regiment, Royal Artillery. Just before the outbreak of World War II the Territorial Army was doubled in size and the battalions created duplicates:
* 8th (Denbighshire) Battalion – &quot;from the 4th Bn&quot;
* 9th (Caernarvonshire &amp; Anglesey) Battalion – &quot;from the 6th Bn&quot;
* 10th (Merionethshire &amp; Montgomeryshire) Battalion – &quot;from the 7th Bn&quot;
* 70th Anti-Tank Regiment – &quot;from the 60th Rgt; granted Royal Welch Fusiliers subtitle in 1942)&quot;

====Second World War; Regular Army====
The regiment was awarded 27 battle honours for World War II, with more than 1,200 fusiliers killed in action or died of wounds.

During the Second World War, the 1st Battalion, Royal Welch Fusiliers was a Regular Army unit and part of the 6th Infantry Brigade, assigned to the 2nd Infantry Division. It served in France in 1940 with the British Expeditionary Force. The battalion fought in the short but fierce battles of France and Belgium and was forced to retreat and be evacuated during the Dunkirk evacuation. After two years spent in the United Kingdom, waiting and preparing for the invasion that never came (Operation Sea Lion), the 1st RWF and the rest of 2nd Division were sent to British India to fight the Imperial Japanese Army after a string of defeats inflicted upon the British and Indian troops. The battalion was involved in the Burma Campaign, particularly the Battle of Kohima, nicknamed &quot;Stalingrad of the East&quot; due to the ferocity of fighting on both sides, that helped to turn the tide of the campaign in the South East Asian theatre.

The 2nd Battalion was part of 29th Independent Infantry Brigade throughout the war. In 1942, it fought in the Battle of Madagascar, then part of Vichy French, before being transferred to the South-East Asian Theatre. In 1944, the battalion and brigade became part of 36th British Infantry Division, previously an Indian Army formation.
Both battalions came under the command of Lieutenant-General Bill Slim, commander of the British Fourteenth Army. This was known as the &#x27;Forgotten Fourteenth,&#x27; allegedly because it fought in a theatre that seemed largely unnoticed and had little importance to the war.

====Second World War; Territorial and War Service====
The 4th, 6th and 7th Battalions, all Territorial units, served in 158th (Royal Welch) Brigade assigned to the 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division. They took part in the Battle of Normandy at Hill 112, where the 53rd Division suffered heavy casualties. Due to heavy fighting and casualties in Normandy, some of the battalions were posted to different brigades within the division. The 53rd again suffered heavily during Operation Veritable (the Battle of the Reichswald) under command of the First Canadian Army, in which action the British and Canadians, and the 53rd Division in particular, endured some of the fiercest fighting of the entire European Campaign against German paratroops.

The 8th, 9th and 10th Battalions were 2nd Line Territorial battalions raised in 1939 as duplicates of the 4th, 6th and 7th Battalions respectively. The battalions initially served in the 115th (Royal Welch Fusiliers) Brigade, 38th (Welsh) Division, itself a 2nd Line duplicate of the 53rd (Welsh) Division.

The 8th and 9th battalions never saw action abroad, remaining in the UK throughout the war in a training role, supplying trained replacements to units overseas. In this capacity, the 9th battalion served with the 80th Infantry (Reserve) Division and the 38th Infantry (Reserve) Division.

In the summer of 1942, the 10th battalion was converted into the 6th (Royal Welch) Battalion, Parachute Regiment. The 6th Parachute Battalion was assigned to the 2nd Parachute Brigade, alongside the 4th and 5th Parachute battalions, originally part of the 1st Airborne Division. The battalion played a small part in the Allied invasion of Italy during Operation Slapstick, an amphibious landing aimed at capturing the port of Taranto. After that, the 2nd Para Brigade became an independent brigade group. The brigade took part in Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of Southern France, being the only British troops to do so (see 2nd Parachute Brigade in Southern France). In late 1944, the brigade was sent to Greece to support pro-Western forces in the Greek Civil War, a forgotten but brutal episode now seen as the first act of the post-1945 Cold War.

In 1938, the 5th Battalion transferred to the Royal Artillery as 60th Anti-Tank Regiment and in 1939, added a 2nd-Line duplicate, 70th Anti-Tank Regiment. Unlike 1914–1918, there were relatively few service battalions, one being 11th (Home Defence) Battalion, raised in 1939 as part of the Home Guard. Formed in 1940, the 12th battalion became 116th Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery in January 1942 and served with 53rd (Welsh) Division until disbanded in December 1944.

===Post Second World War===
The 2nd Battalion Royal Welch remained overseas after the Second World War, with a posting to Burma (still a colony until 4 January 1948) and performed internal security duties. On 7 March 1947 a party aboard a train were ambushed by bandits and seven soldiers were killed.

The regiment did not take part in the Gulf War, but did perform several tours in Northern Ireland (Operation Banner) before being deployed to the Balkans.

During the Yugoslav Wars, the regiment came to attention when 33 of their men and 350 other UN servicemen part of UNPROFOR were taken hostage by Bosnian Serbs at Goražde on 28 May 1995. The situation caused some political debate as the UN troops had been given orders only to &quot;deter attacks&quot; and did not have a mandate or adequate equipment to fully defend the mainly Muslim town of Goražde, which was initially declared &quot;safe&quot; by the UN, thus rendering them exposed when armed members of the Army of Republika Srpska (Bosnian Serb Army) ignored the NATO ultimatum and attacked the town without warning. The regiment managed to hold off the Bosnian Serbs until they were forced to retreat into bunkers – those who did not make it quickly enough were taken hostage – and remained trapped underground while BiH Army reinforcements arrived and fought back. The commanding officer, Lt Col Jonathon Riley (later promoted to Lieutenant General), broke with protocol and directly reported to then Prime Minister John Major about the situation over the phone while in the bunker. All the men were eventually safely rescued. An unprecedented five gallantry awards, seven mentions in despatches and two Queen&#x27;s Commendations for Valuable Service were awarded to the regiment. Although the incident was largely unreported at that time, the regiment was credited in hindsight by observers for saving the town from a possible genocide—after failing to take Goražde, the Bosnian Serbs continued north to Srebrenica, where they would massacre over 8,000 Bosniaks.

===Amalgamation===
It was one of only five line infantry regiments never to have been amalgamated in its entire history, the others being The Royal Scots, The Green Howards, The Cheshire Regiment, and The King&#x27;s Own Scottish Borderers. However, in 2004, it was announced that, as part of the restructuring of the infantry, the Royal Welch Fusiliers would merge with the Royal Regiment of Wales to form a new large regiment, the Royal Welsh.

To honour the links between the regiment and the United States Marine Corps on the 16 September 1945 a set of Marine colours were presented to the regiment at the parish church in Wrexham to commemorate their close connection (see page 32 in official USMC paper published in 1995).

The regiment has a chapel within St Giles Parish Church Wrexham containing their colours and other items. There is an image available taken in 2013.

*&quot;2006: Regiment amalgamated with The Royal Regiment of Wales to form The Royal Welsh&quot;

==Alliances==

The regiment had an alliance with the Canadian Royal 22e Régiment from 1927 until its amalgamation in 2006; this alliance included the frequent exchange of personnel between the two regiments.

==Regimental mascot==
As with the Royal Regiment of Wales, the regiment traditionally had a goat, never called a mascot. The tradition dated back to at least 1775, and possibly to the regiment&#x27;s formation. The goat was always named &#x27;Billy&#x27;.

==Uniform==
Soldiers of this regiment were distinguishable by the unique feature of the &quot;flash&quot;, consisting of five overlapping black silk ribbons (seven inches long for soldiers and nine inches long for officers) on the back of the uniform jacket at neck level. This is a legacy of the days when it was normal for soldiers to wear pigtails. In 1808, this practice was discontinued but when the order was issued the RWF were serving in Nova Scotia and had not received the instruction when the regiment departed to join an expedition to the West Indies. In 1834 the officers of the 23rd Foot were finally granted permission by William IV to wear this non-regulation item as a distinction on the full dress uniform as &quot;a peculiarity whereby to mark the dress of that distinguished regiment&quot;. This was extended to all ranks in 1900.

Khaki service dress replaced the scarlet tunic as the principal uniform, and the Army Council attempted to remove the flash during the First World War, citing the grounds that it would help the Germans identify which unit was facing them. As Fusilier officer Robert Graves reported, &quot;the regiment retorted by inquiring on what occasion since the retreat from Corunna, when the regiment was the last to leave Spain, with the keys of the town postern in the pocket of one of its officers, had any of His Majesty&#x27;s enemies seen the back of a Royal Welch Fusilier?,&quot; and the matter remained &quot;in abeyance throughout the war.&quot; The efforts of the regiment to retain the distinction was further reinforced at a medal ceremony when King George V saw an officer of the regiment in the line. He ordered an About Turn and seeing the flash still on the tunic said &quot;sotto voce&quot;, &quot;don&#x27;t ever let anyone take it from you!&quot; The wearing of the flash on service dress was extended to other ranks in 1924.

As a fusilier regiment, the RWF wore a hackle, which consisted of a plume of white feathers mounted behind the cap-badge of the modern beret. The full dress of the Royal Welch Fusiliers, as worn by the entire regiment until 1914, included a racoon-skin hat (bearskin for officers) with a white hackle and a scarlet tunic with the dark blue facings of a Royal regiment. This uniform continued to be worn by the RWF&#x27;s Corps of Drums and the Regimental Pioneers until the merger of 2006.
==Regimental Prayer==
The Regimental Collect (or prayer as it is also known as) was in Welsh:

<text>Blohm+Voss (B+V), also written historically as Blohm &amp; Voss, Blohm und Voß etc., is a German shipbuilding and engineering company. Founded in Hamburg in 1877 to specialise in steel-hulled ships, its most famous product was the World War II battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot;. In the 1930s, its owners established the Hamburger Flugzeugbau aircraft manufacturer which, shortly before the outbreak of World War II, adopted the name of its parent company. Following a difficult period after the war, B+V was revived, changing ownership among several owners, as Thyssen Group and Star Capital. In 2016, it became a subsidiary of Lürssen and continues to supply both the military and civilian markets. It serves two areas – new construction of warships as NVL B.V. &amp; Co. KG, and new construction and refitting of megayachts. The company has been in operation, building ships and other large machinery, almost continuously for years.

==History==
===Early years===

Blohm &amp; Voss was founded on 5 April 1877 by Hermann Blohm and Ernst Voss (or Voß) as a general partnership, to build steel-hulled ships. It established a shipyard on the island of Kuhwerder, near the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg, covering with of water frontage and three building berths, two suitable for ships of up to length. The company name was shown with the ampersand, as B&amp;V, until 1955.

Shipbuilding was at that time dominated by the British, with even German customers preferring to buy from them. Initial business was confined to ship repairs, although B&amp;V managed to build and later sell the three-masted barque &quot;National&quot;. Eventually the first new-build order arrived for the small cargo paddle-steamer &quot;Burg&quot;, and the business took off. By 1882, the company had gained a reputation for quality and punctuality and was prospering.

Initially, their products were steel-hulled sailing ships designed for long sea voyages. At that time steamships had a relatively short range, while many of the advantages of steel construction still applied to sailing ships as much as to steam. The company built its first steamship in 1900, while still continuing to build sailing ships until the late 1930s.

===The Nazi era, 1933–1945===

When Hermann Blohm died, his two sons and took over. Ernst Voss left soon afterwards. By this time the company was in financial crisis, so the Blohm brothers diversified into aircraft, setting up the Hamburger Flugzeugbau (see below) in the summer of 1933.

With the rise of the Nazi Party to power in 1933, Germany began to rearm and both companies became increasingly involved in the programme. The shipyard built both civilian craft and warships for the government, including the battleship , before manufacturing U-boats in quantity.

In 1944 a subcamp of Neuengamme concentration camp was set up at the company&#x27;s shipyard in Hamburg-Steinwerder. It supplied labour to the company from July 1944 to April 1945. A report dated 29 August states:

Rudolf Blohm was present during this visit.

A memorial stands on the site of the camp and the company continues to pay an undisclosed amount to the Fund for Compensation of Forced Laborers. Steinwerder was badly damaged during the bombing of Hamburg in World War II and at the end of it, shipbuilding was forbidden.

===Hamburger Flugzeugbau===


In 1933 Blohm &amp; Voss was suffering a financial crisis from lack of work. Its owners, brothers Rudolf and Walther Blohm, decided to diversify into aircraft manufacture, believing that there would soon be a market for all-metal, long-range flying boats, especially with the German state airline Deutsche Luft Hansa. They also felt that their experience with all-metal marine construction would prove an advantage. They formed the Hamburger Flugzeugbau that summer.

Most of the aircraft built by HFB/B&amp;V would in fact be other companies&#x27; designs and major subassemblies, contracted under license, including tens of thousands of aircraft each for Dornier, Heinkel, Junkers and Messerschmitt. Alongside its volume manufacturing the company also maintained its own design office and workshops which continued to develop and build new types throughout the company&#x27;s life. The first planes it produced were designated with the official RLM company code &quot;Ha&quot;.

The aircraft produced by Hamburger Flugzeugbau were still commonly associated with Blohm &amp; Voss and this was causing confusion, so in September 1937 Hamburger Flugzeugbau was renamed &quot;Abteilung Flugzeugbau der Schiffswerft Blohm &amp; Voss&quot; and the RLM changed its company code to &quot;BV&quot;.

Its most significant designs were flying boats, mainly used by the Luftwaffe for maritime patrol and reconnaissance. Most numerous was the BV 138 &quot;Seedrache&quot; (initiated as the Ha 138), a twin-boom trimotor, while the BV 222 &quot;Wiking&quot; was much larger. Largest of all was the BV 238 prototype, the largest aircraft built by any of the Axis forces. Other notable types include the asymmetric BV 141, which was built in moderate numbers but did not enter production.

At the end of the war, aircraft production was shut down. Hamburger Flugzeugbau GmBH (HFB) re-emerged in 1956, still under the ownership of Walther Blohm but no longer connected to B+V. It reopened the former B+V aircraft factory at Finkenwerder and subsequently underwent various further changes of ownership and company name, eventually becoming part of Airbus.

===Postwar===

After the Second World War, the British continued to demolish the shipyards of Steinwerder. B&amp;V, unable to restart shipbuilding work, all but ceased to exist for several years.

In 1950, B&amp;V created a new subsidiary company, Steinwerder Industrie AG, to manufacture machinery and boilers on the site. Its shipyard fortunes began to revive in 1952 when the new company was allowed to restart ship repair work and the City of Hamburg subsequently guaranteed it credit. By 1953 some 900 workers were back in employment. The building of new ships would later also be allowed again; the first ship built was the Wappen von Hamburg in 1955. During this period of resurrection the level of investment required meant that B&amp;V moved out of private hands and became a publicly quoted company, 50% owned by Phoenix-Rheinrohr AG, itself soon to be consolidated into the Thyssen Group. Even so, B&amp;V would never regain its former size. In 1966 it took over neighbouring shipbuilder H. C. Stülcken Sohn.

During the postwar years, B+V built oil rigs and developed a market for other offshore products such as support ships and pipelines. The company has also built ships for numerous commercial customers, including luxury yachts. &quot;Eclipse&quot;, built for Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, is in length making it the second longest private yacht in the world. B+V still administers the Elbe 17 dry dock at Hamburg. The semi-submersible drilling rig &quot;Chris Chenery&quot; was constructed in 1974 for The Offshore Co. of Houston, US. When Thyssen AG and Krupp merged in 1999, B+V became a subsidiary of ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems.

In December 2001, Blohm+Voss, Nordseewerke and Friedrich Lurssen Werft were awarded the contract to build the first five K130 MEKO frigates for the German Navy. The first of them, &quot;Braunschweig&quot;, was built at Blohm+Voss, launched in April 2006 and commissioned in April 2008. Several problems with the equipment fit delayed commissioning, and the last was commissioned in 2013.

In 2011 ThyssenKrupp agreed the sale of the Blohm+Voss civil shipbuilding division to British investment company STAR Capital Partners. The military division remained with ThyssenKrupp.

In October 2016, regulatory approval was given for Lürssen to acquire Blohm+Voss from STAR Capital Partners. In April 2017 the company dismissed 300 employees from which were 1000.

In September 2017, the German Navy commissioned the construction of five K130 corvettes by a consortium of North German shipyards including ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems, Blohm+Voss, and the German Naval Yards in Kiel. The Lürssen Group, which would be the main contractor in the production of the vessels, distributed its work between the two sites at Wolgast and B+V Hamburg to build only two, &quot;Köln&quot; in 2021 and &quot;Emden&quot; in 2022. The contract was worth around 2 billion euros.

On 25 July 2019, Peter Lürßen invested €20 million into the shipyard. Dock 10 was covered with a roof 200m-long and 50m-high for a cost of €13 million. The mounting of steel pillars above the dock&#x27;s walls started in October 2020. On 29 April 2021, the hull of the yacht &quot;Opera&quot;, also called &quot;Coral Ocean&quot;, was transferred from Dock 17 to Dock 10 and both were tugged to Berne, Germany to stay at least 2 years. The previous 146-m &quot;Sassi&quot;, which was burned to the point that only the engine section block remained, formed part of &quot;Opera&quot;. Lürßen&#x27;s Dock 3 was transferred to the Jade shipyard at Wilhelmshaven. In Berne, a hall was extended. &quot;Mein Schiff 3&quot; then docked in Dock 17, followed by &quot;AIDAcara&quot; and &quot;AIDAmar&quot;, the latest cruise ships to visit the dock.
===Since October 2021===
According to an interview and meeting published in &quot;Hamburger Morgenpost&quot; on 30 September 2021 and repeated at &quot;Hamburger Abendblatt&quot;, the workforce was advised that Lürssen would no longer refit cruise ships in Hamburg anymore. The new building department was dissolved. All six floating docks were in review. The repair division was not a success. Despite the around 20 million euros invested in modern shipyard technology, the subletting of many halls and the shrinkage to only around a third of the used shipyard area, the costs were still too high and is not yet fit for the future. The location is too expensive compared to other shipyards, so structural measures and cost adjustments were necessary.

<text>Object–relational mapping (ORM, O/RM, and O/R mapping tool) in computer science is a programming technique for converting data between a relational database and the memory (usually the heap) of an object-oriented programming language. This creates, in effect, a virtual object database that can be used from within the programming language.

In object-oriented programming, data-management tasks act on objects that combine scalar values into objects. For example, consider an address book entry that represents a single person along with zero or more phone numbers and zero or more addresses. This could be modeled in an object-oriented implementation by a &quot;Person object&quot; with an attribute/field to hold each data item that the entry comprises: the person&#x27;s name, a list of phone numbers, and a list of addresses. The list of phone numbers would itself contain &quot;PhoneNumber objects&quot; and so on. Each such address-book entry is treated as a single object by the programming language (it can be referenced by a single variable containing a pointer to the object, for instance). Various methods can be associated with the object, such as methods to return the preferred phone number, the home address, and so on.

By contrast, relational databases, such as SQL, group scalars into tuples, which are then enumerated in tables. Tuples and objects have some general similarity, in that they are both ways to collect values into named fields such that the whole collection can be manipulated as a single compound entity. They have many differences, though, in particular: lifecycle management (row insertion and deletion, versus garbage collection or reference counting), references to other entities (object references, versus foreign key references), and inheritance (non-existent in relational databases). As well, objects are managed on-heap and are under full control of a single process, while database tuples are shared and must incorporate locking, merging, and retry. Object–relational mapping provides automated support for mapping tuples to objects and back, while accounting for all of these differences.

The heart of the problem involves translating the logical representation of the objects into an atomized form that is capable of being stored in the database while preserving the properties of the objects and their relationships so that they can be reloaded as objects when needed. If this storage and retrieval functionality is implemented, the objects are said to be persistent.

==Overview==
Implementation-specific details of storage drivers are generally wrapped in an API in the programming language in use, exposing methods to interact with the storage medium in a way which is simpler and more in line with the paradigms of surrounding code.

The following is a simple example, written in C# code, to execute a query written in SQL using a database engine.
var sql = &quot;SELECT id, first_name, last_name, phone, birth_date, sex, age FROM persons WHERE id = 10&quot;;
var result = context.Persons.FromSqlRaw(sql).ToList();
var name = result[0][&quot;first_name&quot;];
In contrast, the following makes use of an ORM-job API which makes it possible to write code that naturally makes use of the features of the language.
var person = repository.GetPerson(10);
var firstName = person.GetFirstName();
The case above makes use of an object representing the storage repository and methods of that object. Other frameworks might provide code as static methods, as in the example below, and yet other methods may not implement an object-oriented system at all. Often the choice of paradigm is made for the best fit of the ORM into the surrounding language&#x27;s design principles.
var person = Person.Get(10);
==Comparison with traditional data access techniques==
Compared to traditional techniques of exchange between an object-oriented language and a relational database, ORM often reduces the amount of code that needs to be written.

Disadvantages of ORM tools generally stem from the high level of abstraction obscuring what is actually happening in the implementation code. Also, heavy reliance on ORM software has been cited as a major factor in producing poorly designed databases.

==Object-oriented databases==
Another approach is to use an object-oriented database management system (OODBMS) or document-oriented databases such as native XML databases that provide more flexibility in data modeling. OODBMSs are databases designed specifically for working with object-oriented values. Using an OODBMS eliminates the need for converting data to and from its SQL form, as the data is stored in its original object representation and relationships are directly represented, rather than requiring join tables/operations. The equivalent of ORMs for document-oriented databases are called object-document mappers (ODMs).

Document-oriented databases also prevent the user from having to &quot;shred&quot; objects into table rows. Many of these systems also support the XQuery query language to retrieve datasets.

Object-oriented databases tend to be used in complex, niche applications. One of the arguments against using an OODBMS is that it may not be able to execute ad-hoc, application-independent queries. For this reason, many programmers find themselves more at home with an object-SQL mapping system, even though most object-oriented databases are able to process SQL queries to a limited extent. Other OODBMS provide replication to SQL databases, as a means of addressing the need for ad-hoc queries, while preserving well-known query patterns.

==Challenges==
A variety of difficulties arise when considering how to match an object system to a relational database. These difficulties are referred to as the object–relational impedance mismatch.

An alternative to implementing ORM is use of the native procedural languages provided with every major database. These can be called from the client using SQL statements. The Data Access Object (DAO) design pattern is used to abstract these statements and offer a lightweight object-oriented interface to the rest of the application.

ORMs are limited to their predefined functionality, which may not cover all edge cases or database features. They usually mitigate this limitation by providing users with an interface to write raw queries, such as Django ORM.

<text>Pope Hyginus () was the bishop of Rome from 138 to his death in 142. Tradition holds that during his papacy he determined the various prerogatives of the clergy and defined the grades of the ecclesiastical hierarchy.

Hyginus instituted godparents at baptism to assist the baptised during their Christian life. He also decreed that all churches be consecrated. He is said to have died a martyr, though no records verify this. The chronology of the early bishops of Rome cannot be determined with any degree of exactitude today.

==History==
According to the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, Hyginus was a Greek by birth. Irenaeus says that the gnostic Valentinus came to Rome in Hyginus&#x27; time, remaining there until Anicetus became pontiff.

Cerdo, another Gnostic and predecessor of Marcion of Sinope, also lived at Rome in the reign of Hyginus; by confessing his errors and recanting, he succeeded in obtaining readmission into the Church but eventually fell back into heresy and was expelled from the Church.
The &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; also relates that this pope organized the hierarchy and established the order of ecclesiastical precedence (&quot;&quot;). This general observation recurs also in the biography of Pope Hormisdas. According to Louis Duchesne, the writer probably referred to the lower orders of the clergy.

The ancient sources contain no information as to his having died a martyr. At his death he was buried on the Vatican Hill, near Saint Peter&#x27;s tomb. His feast is celebrated on 11 January.

His feast day in the Eastern Orthodox Church is also 11 January.

<text>Pope Pius X (; né Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto; 2 June 1835 – 20 August 1914) was head of the Catholic Church from 4 August 1903 to his death. Pius X is known for vigorously opposing modernist interpretations of Catholic doctrine, and for promoting liturgical reforms and Thomist scholastic theology. He initiated the preparation of the 1917 Code of Canon Law, the first comprehensive and systemic work of its kind, which would ultimately be promulgated by his successor. He is venerated as a saint in the Catholic Church.

Pius X was devoted to the Blessed Virgin Mary under the title of Our Lady of Confidence; while his papal encyclical &quot;Ad diem illum&quot; took on a sense of renewal that was reflected in the motto of his pontificate. He advanced the Liturgical Movement by formulating the principle of &quot;participatio actuosa&quot; (active participation of the faithful) in his motu proprio, &quot;Tra le sollecitudini&quot; (1903). He encouraged the frequent reception of Holy Communion, and he lowered the age for First Communion, which became a lasting innovation of his papacy.

Like his predecessors, he promoted Thomism as the principal philosophical method to be taught in Catholic institutions. He vehemently opposed various 19th-century philosophies that he viewed as an intrusion of secular errors incompatible with Catholic dogma, especially modernism, which he critiqued as the synthesis of every heresy.

Pius X was known for his firm demeanour and sense of personal poverty, reflected by his membership of the Third Order of Saint Francis. He regularly gave sermons from the pulpit, a rare practice at the time. After the 1908 Messina earthquake he filled the Apostolic Palace with refugees, long before the Italian government acted. He rejected any kind of favours for his family, and his close relatives chose to remain in poverty, living near Rome. He also undertook a reform of the Roman Curia with the Apostolic Constitution &quot;Sapienti consilio&quot; in 1908.

After his death, a strong cult of devotion followed his reputation for piety and holiness. He was beatified in 1951 and canonized in 1954 by Pope Pius XII. A statue bearing his name stands within Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica, and his birth town was renamed Riese Pio X after his death.

==Early life and ministry==
Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto was born in Riese, Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, Austrian Empire (now in the province of Treviso, Veneto, Italy), in 1835. He was the second born of ten children of Giovanni Battista Sarto (1792–1852), the village postman, and Margherita Sanson (1813–1894). He was baptised 3 June 1835. Though poor, his parents valued education, and Giuseppe walked to school each day.

Giuseppe had three brothers and six sisters: Giuseppe Sarto (born 1834; died after six days), Angelo Sarto (1837–1916), Teresa Parolin-Sarto (1839–1920), Rosa Sarto (1841–1913), Antonia Dei Bei-Sarto (1843–1917), Maria Sarto (1846–1930), Lucia Boschin-Sarto (1848–1924), Anna Sarto (1850–1926), Pietro Sarto (born 1852; died after six months). As Pope, he rejected any kind of favours for his family: his brother remained a postal clerk, his favourite nephew stayed on as village priest, and his three single sisters lived together in humble circumstances in Rome.

Giuseppe, nicknamed as &quot;Bepi&quot; by his mother, had so much natural exuberance that his teacher often had to cane his backside. Despite this, he was an excellent student who focused on homework before hobbies or recreations. In the evenings after sports or games with friends, he would spend ten minutes in prayer before returning home. He also served as an altar boy. By the age of ten, he had completed the two elementary classes of his village school as well as Latin study with a local priest; henceforth he had to walk four miles to the gymnasium in Castelfranco Veneto for further classes. For the next four years, he would attend Mass before breakfast and his long walk to school. He often carried his shoes to make them last longer. As a poor boy, he was often teased for his meager lunches and shabby clothes but never complained to his teachers.

In 1850, he received the tonsure from his parish priest, who wrote to the Cardinal of Venice to secure Sarto a scholarship to the Seminary of Padua, &quot;where he finished his classical, philosophical, and theological studies with distinction&quot;.
On 18 September 1858, Sarto was ordained a priest by Giovanni Antonio Farina, Bishop of Treviso (later canonized), and became a chaplain at Tombolo. While there, Sarto expanded his knowledge of theology, studying Thomas Aquinas and canon law, while carrying out most of the functions of the sickly parish priest Constantini. Often, Sarto sought to improve his sermons by the advice of Constantini, who referred to one of his earliest as &quot;rubbish&quot;. In Tombolo, Sarto&#x27;s reputation for holiness grew so much that some of the people call him &quot;Don Santo&quot;.

In 1867, he was named archpriest of Salzano. He restored the local church and expanded the hospital, the funds coming from his own begging, wealth and labour. He won the people&#x27;s affection when he worked to assist the sick during the cholera outbreak of the early 1870s. He was appointed a canon of the cathedral and chancellor of the Diocese of Treviso, also acting as spiritual director and rector of the Treviso seminary and examiner of the clergy. As chancellor he made it possible for public school students to receive religious instruction. As a priest and later bishop, he often struggled to bring religious instruction to rural and urban youth who could not attend Catholic schools. At one stage, a large stack of hay caught fire near a cottage, and when Sarto arrived he addressed the frantic people, &quot;Don&#x27;t be afraid, the fire will be put out and your house will be saved!&quot; At that moment, the flames turned in the other direction, sparing the cottage. Despite his many duties, Sarto often made time for an evening walk with children preparing their First Communion.

In 1879, Bishop Federico Maria Zinelli died, and Sarto was elected vicar capitular to care for the diocese until the installation of a new bishop in June 1880.

After 1880, Sarto taught dogmatic theology and moral theology at the seminary in Treviso. On 10 November 1884, he was appointed bishop of Mantua by Pope Leo XIII. He was consecrated six days later in Rome in the church of Sant&#x27;Apollinare alle Terme Neroniane-Alessandrine, Rome, by Cardinal Lucido Parocchi, assisted by Pietro Rota, and by Giovanni Maria Berengo. He was appointed to the honorary position of assistant at the pontifical throne on 19 June 1891. Sarto required papal dispensation from Pope Leo XIII before episcopal consecration as he lacked a doctorate, making him the last pope without a doctorate until Pope Francis.

When Sarto travelled back to his hometown from Rome after his consecration, he immediately went to visit his mother. There, she repeatedly kissed his ring and said to him: &quot;But you would not have this fine ring, son, if I did not have this&quot;, showing him her wedding ring.

== Cardinalate and patriarchate ==

Pope Leo XIII made him a cardinal of the order of cardinal priests in a secret consistory on 12 June 1893. In a public consistory on 15 June, the pope gave him his cardinal&#x27;s red galero, assigned him the titular church of San Bernardo alle Terme, and appointed him Patriarch of Venice. This caused difficulty, however, as the government of reunified Italy claimed the right to nominate the Patriarch, since the previous sovereign, the Emperor of Austria, had exercised that power. The poor relations between the Roman Curia and the Italian civil government since the annexation of the Papal States in 1870 placed additional strain on the appointment. The number of vacant sees soon grew to 30. Sarto was finally permitted to assume the position of patriarch in 1894. In regard to being named as a cardinal, Sarto told a local newspaper that he felt &quot;anxious, terrified and humiliated&quot;.

After being named cardinal and before leaving for Venice, he visited his mother. Overwhelmed with emotion, she asked: &quot;My son, give your mother a last blessing&quot;, sensing that it would be the last time that they would see each other. Arriving in Venice, he was formally enthroned on 24 November 1894.

As cardinal-patriarch, Sarto avoided politics, allocating his time to social works and strengthening parochial credit unions. However, in his first pastoral letter to the Venetians, Sarto argued that in matters pertaining to the pope, &quot;There should be no questions, no subtleties, no opposing of personal rights to his rights, but only obedience.&quot;

In April 1903, Pope Leo XIII reportedly said to Lorenzo Perosi: &quot;Hold him very dear, Perosi, as in the future he will be able to do much for you. We firmly believe he will be our successor&quot;. As a cardinal, he was considered by the time of his papal election as one of the most prominent preachers in the Church despite his lesser fame globally. In his role as a cardinal, Sarto held membership in the congregations for Bishops and Regulars, Rites, and Indulgences and Sacred Relics.

==Papal election of 1903==

Leo XIII died 20 July 1903, and at the end of that month the conclave convened to elect his successor. Before the conclave, Sarto had reportedly said, &quot;rather dead than pope&quot;, when people discussed his chances for election. In one of the meetings held just before the conclave, Cardinal Victor-Lucien-Sulpice Lécot spoke with Sarto in French, however, Sarto replied in Latin, &quot;I&#x27;m afraid I do not speak French&quot;. Lécot replied, &quot;But if Your Eminence does not speak French you have no chance of being elected because the pope must speak French&quot;, to which Sarto said, &quot;Deo Gratias! I have no desire to be pope&quot;.

According to historians, the favorite was the late pope&#x27;s secretary of state, Cardinal Mariano Rampolla. On the first ballot, Rampolla received 24 votes, Gotti had 17 votes, and Sarto 5 votes. On the second ballot, Rampolla had gained five votes, as did Sarto. The next day, it seemed that Rampolla would be elected. However, the Polish Cardinal Jan Puzyna de Kosielsko from Kraków, in the name of Emperor Franz Joseph (1848–1916) of Austria-Hungary, proclaimed a veto (&quot;jus exclusivae&quot;) against Rampolla&#x27;s election. Many in the conclave protested, and it was even suggested to disregard the veto.

However, the third vote had already begun, resulting in no clear winner but increasing support for Sarto, with 21 votes. The fourth vote showed Rampolla with 30 votes and Sarto with 24. It seemed clear that the cardinals were moving toward Sarto.

The following morning, the fifth vote gave Rampolla 10 votes, Gotti 2, and Sarto 50. Thus, on 4 August 1903, Sarto was elected to the pontificate. This marked the last known exercise of a papal veto by a Catholic monarch.

At first, it is reported, Sarto declined the nomination, feeling unworthy. He had been deeply saddened by the Austro-Hungarian veto and vowed to rescind these powers and excommunicate anyone who communicated such a veto during a conclave. With the cardinals asking him to reconsider, he went into solitude in the Pauline Chapel, and after deep prayer he accepted the position. Cardinal Luigi Macchi announced Sarto&#x27;s election at around 12:10pm.

Sarto took as his papal name Pius X, out of respect for his recent predecessors of the same name, particularly Pope Pius IX (1846–1878), who had fought against theological liberals and for papal supremacy. He explained: &quot;As I shall suffer, I shall take the name of those Popes who also suffered&quot;. Pius X&#x27;s traditional coronation took place the following Sunday, 9 August 1903. As pope, he became ex officio Grand Master of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem, prefect of the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office, and prefect of the Sacred Consistorial Congregation.

==Pontificate==

The pontificate of Pius X was noted for conservative theology and reforms in liturgy and Church law. In what became his motto, the Pope in 1903 devoted his papacy to &quot;Instaurare Omnia in Christo&quot;, &quot;to restore all things in Christ.&quot; In his first encyclical (&quot;E supremi apostolatus&quot;, 4 October 1903), he stated his overriding policy: &quot;We champion the authority of God. His authority and Commandments should be recognized, deferred to, and respected.&quot;

Continuing his simple origins, he wore a pectoral cross of gilded metal on the day of his coronation; and when his entourage was horrified, the new pope declared he always wore it and had brought no other with him. He was well known for reducing papal ceremonies. He also abolished the custom of the pope dining alone, since the time of Pope Urban VIII, and invited his friends to eat with him.

When chided by Rome&#x27;s social leaders for refusing to make his peasant sisters papal countesses, he responded: &quot;I have made them sisters of the Pope; what more can I do for them?&quot;

He developed a reputation as being very friendly with children. He carried candy in his pockets for the street urchins in Mantua and Venice, and taught them catechism. During papal audiences, he would gather children around him and talk about things that interested them. His weekly catechism lessons in the courtyard of San Damaso in the Vatican always included a special place for children, and his decision to require the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine in every parish was partly motivated by a desire to save children from religious ignorance.

Noted for his humility and simplicity, he declared that he had not changed personally save for his white cassock. Aides consistently needed to remind him not to wipe his pen on the white cassock, as he had previously done on his black cassock which hid stains. The new pope&#x27;s schedule was quite similar each day. He rose at 4:00am before celebrating Mass at 6:00am. He was at his desk at 8:00am to receive private audiences. On his desk stood statues of John Vianney and Joan of Arc, both of whom he beatified in his papacy. At noon, he conducted a general audience with pilgrims, then had lunch at 1:00pm with his two secretaries or whomever else he invited to dine with him. Resting for a short while after lunch, Pius X would then return to work before dining at 9:00pm and a final stint of work before sleep.

== Church reforms and theology ==

===Restoration in Christ and Mariology===
In his 1904 encyclical &quot;Ad diem illum&quot;, he views Mary in the context of &quot;restoring everything in Christ&quot;.

He wrote:
During Pius X&#x27;s pontificate, many famed Marian images were granted a canonical coronation: Our Lady of Aparecida, Our Lady of the Pillar, Our Lady of the Cape, Our Lady of Chiquinquira of Colombia, Our Lady of San Juan de los Lagos, Our Lady of La Naval de Manila, Virgin of Help of Venezuela, Our Lady of Carmel of New York, the Marian icon of Santuario della Consolata and the Immaculate Conception within the &quot;Chapel of the Choir&quot; inside Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica were granted this prestigious honor.

== &quot;Tra le sollecitudini&quot; and Gregorian chant ==
Within three months of his coronation, Pius X published his &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Tra le sollecitudini&quot;. Classical and Baroque compositions had long been favoured over Gregorian chant in ecclesiastical music. The Pope announced a return to earlier musical styles, championed by Lorenzo Perosi. Since 1898, Perosi had been Director of the Sistine Chapel Choir, a title which Pius X upgraded to &quot;Perpetual Director&quot;. The Pope&#x27;s choice of Joseph Pothier to supervise the new editions of chant led to the official adoption of the Solesmes edition of Gregorian chant.

== Liturgical reforms and communion ==
Pius X worked to increase devotion among both clergy and laity, particularly in the Breviary, which he reformed considerably, and the Mass.

Besides restoring to prominence Gregorian chant, he placed a renewed liturgical emphasis on the Eucharist, saying, &quot;Holy Communion is the shortest and safest way to Heaven.&quot; To this end, he encouraged frequent reception of Holy Communion. This also extended to children who had reached the &quot;age of discretion&quot;, though he did not permit the ancient Eastern practice of infant communion. He also emphasized frequent recourse to the Sacrament of Penance so that Holy Communion would be received worthily. Pius X&#x27;s devotion to the Eucharist would eventually earn him the honorific of &quot;Pope of the Blessed Sacrament&quot;, by which he is still known among his devotees.

In 1910, he issued the decree &quot;Quam singulari&quot;, which changed the age at which Communion could be received from 12 to 7 years old, the age of discretion. The pope lowered the age because he wished to impress the event on the minds of children and stimulate their parents to new religious observance; this decree was found unwelcome in some places due to the belief that parents would withdraw their children early from Catholic schools, now that First Communion was carried out earlier. Pius X even personally distributed First Communion to a four-year-old boy the day after the child was presented to him and demonstrated an exceptional understanding of the meaning of the sacrament. When people would criticize Pius X for lowering the age of reception, he simply quoted the words of Jesus, &quot;let the little children come to me&quot;.

Pius X said in his 1903 &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Tra le sollecitudini&quot;, &quot;The primary and indispensable source of the true Christian spirit is participation in the most holy mysteries and in the public, official prayer of the Church.&quot;

He also sought to modify papal ceremonies to underscore their religious significance by eliminating occasions for applause. For example, when entering his first public consistory for the creation of cardinals in November 1903, he was not carried above the crowds on the &quot;sedia gestatoria&quot; as was traditional. He arrived on foot wearing a cope and mitre at the end of the procession of prelates &quot;almost hidden behind the double line of Palatine Guards through which he passed&quot;.

== Anti-modernism ==
Pope Leo XIII had sought to revive the inheritance of Thomas Aquinas, &#x27;the marriage of reason and revelation&#x27;, as a response to secular Enlightenment. Under Pius X, &quot;neo-Thomism&quot; became the blueprint for theology.

Most controversially, Pius X vigorously condemned the theological movement he termed &#x27;Modernism&#x27;, which he regarded as a heresy endangering the Catholic faith. The movement was linked especially to certain Catholic French scholars such as Louis Duchesne, who applied modern critical methods to Church history, drawing together archaeology and topography to supplement literature and setting ecclesiastical events with contexts of social history. Alfred Loisy, a student of Duchesne, denied that some parts of Scripture were literally rather than metaphorically true. In contradiction to Thomas Aquinas, they argued that there was an unbridgeable gap between natural and supernatural knowledge. From the traditional viewpoint, such investigations led inevitably to relativism and scepticism. The modernist and relativist theological trends tried to assimilate modern philosophers like Immanuel Kant as well as rationalism into Catholic theology.

Anti-Modernists viewed these notions as contrary to the dogmas and traditions of the Catholic Church. In the decree entitled &quot;Lamentabili sane exitu&quot; (&quot;A Lamentable Departure Indeed&quot;) of 3 July 1907, Pius X formally condemned 65 propositions, mainly drawn from the works of Alfred Loisy and concerning the nature of the Church, revelation, biblical exegesis, the sacraments, and the divinity of Christ. That was followed by the encyclical &quot;Pascendi dominici gregis&quot; (or &quot;Feeding the Lord&#x27;s Flock&quot;), which characterized Modernism as the &quot;synthesis of all heresies.&quot; 

Escalating the campaign, Pius X ordered that all clerics take the Anti-Modernist oath, &quot;Sacrorum antistitum&quot;. The pope&#x27;s aggressive stance against Modernism caused some disruption within the Church, although only about 40 clerics refused to take the oath. Catholic scholarship with Modernist tendencies was greatly discouraged, and theologians who wished to pursue lines of inquiry in line with Secularism, Modernism, or Relativism were threatened with sanctions up to excommunication.

Pius X&#x27;s attitude toward the Modernists was uncompromising. Speaking of those who counselled leniency, he said: &quot;They want them to be treated with oil, soap and caresses. But they should be beaten with fists. In a duel, you don&#x27;t count or measure the blows, you strike as you can.&quot; He also instituted the &quot;Sodalitium Pianum&quot; (or League of Pius V), an anti-Modernist network of informants, which was much criticised due to its accusations of heresy on limited evidence. This campaign was run by Monsignor Umberto Benigni in the Department of Extraordinary Affairs in the Secretariat of State, which distributed anti-Modernist propaganda and gathered information on &quot;culprits&quot;. In Benigni&#x27;s secret code, Pius X was known as &quot;Mama&quot;. Among those it investigated was the teacher of church history, Angelo Roncalli (later Pope John XXIII), but the Holy Office cleared him of all charges.

== Catechism of Saint Pius X ==

In his 1905 letter &quot;Acerbo nimis&quot;, Pius X mandated the establishment of the Confraternity of Christian Doctrine (catechism class) in every parish in the world, and he extolled cathetical training as a method of religious teaching.

The &quot;Catechism of Pius X&quot; is his realisation of a simple, plain, brief, popular catechism for uniform use throughout the whole world; it was used in the ecclesiastical province of Rome and for some years in other parts of Italy; it was not, however, prescribed for use throughout the universal Church. It was issued in 1908 in Italian as &quot;Catechismo della dottrina Cristiana, Pubblicato per Ordine del Sommo Pontifice San Pio X&quot;. An English translation (&quot;Catechism of Saint Pius X&quot;) runs to 115 pages.

Pope Bendict XVI praised its &quot;simplicity of exposition and depth of content. Also because of this, Pius X&#x27;s catechism might have friends in the future.&quot; Asked in 2003 whether the almost 100-year-old work was still valid, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger said: &quot;The faith as such is always the same. Hence the Catechism of Saint Pius X always preserves its value. Whereas ways of transmitting the contents of the faith can change instead. And hence one may wonder whether the Catechism of Saint Pius X can in that sense still be considered valid today.&quot; 

The Society of Saint Pius X (SSPX), a canonically irregular, traditionalist fraternity, recommends the Catechism of Saint Pius X over the 1992 &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot;.

== Reform of canon law ==

Canon law of the Catholic Church varied from region to region with no overall prescriptions. On 19 March 1904, Pope Pius X named a commission of cardinals to draft a universal set of laws. Two of his successors worked in the commission: Giacomo della Chiesa, who became Pope Benedict XV, and Eugenio Pacelli, who became Pope Pius XII. This first Code of Canon Law was promulgated by Benedict XV on 27 May 1917, with an effective date of 19 May 1918, and remained in effect until Advent 1983, when Pope John Paul II, promulgated the contemporary canon law.

== Reform of Church administration ==
Pius X reformed the Roman Curia with the constitution &quot;Sapienti Consilio&quot; (29 June 1908) and specified new rules enforcing a bishop&#x27;s oversight of seminaries in the encyclical &quot;Pieni l&#x27;animo&quot;. He established regional seminaries (closing some smaller ones), and promulgated a new plan of seminary study. He also barred clergy from administering social organizations.

== Church policies towards secular governments ==
Pius X reversed the accommodating approach of Leo XIII towards secular governments, appointing Rafael Merry del Val as Cardinal Secretary of State (Merry del Val would later have his own cause opened for canonization in 1953, but still has not been beatified). When the French president Émile Loubet visited the Italian monarch Victor Emmanuel III (1900–1946), Pius X, still refusing to accept the annexation of the papal territories by Italy, reproached the French president for the visit and refused to meet him. This led to a diplomatic break with France and to the 1905 Law of Separation between church and state, by which the Church lost government funding in France. The pope denounced this law in his encyclicals &quot;Vehementer Nos&quot; and &quot;Gravissimo officii munere&quot;, and removed two French bishops for recognising the Third Republic. Eventually, France expelled the Jesuits and broke off diplomatic relations with the Vatican.

The pope adopted a similar position toward secular governments in Portugal, Ireland, Poland, Ethiopia, and in other states with large Catholic populations. His opposition to international relations with Italy angered the secular powers of these countries, as well as a few others like the United Kingdom and Russia. In Ireland, Protestants increasingly worried that a proposed &quot;Home Rule&quot; by an Irish parliament representing the Catholic majority (rather than the &quot;status quo&quot; of rule by Westminster since the 1800 Union of Ireland and Great Britain) would result in &quot;Rome Rule&quot; due to Pius X&#x27;s uncompromising stance being followed by Irish Catholics (Ultramontanism).

In 1908, the papal decree &quot;Ne Temere&quot; came into effect which complicated mixed marriages. Marriages not performed by a Catholic priest were declared legal but sacramentally invalid, worrying some Protestants that the Church would counsel separation for couples married in a Protestant church or by civil service. Priests were given discretion to refuse mixed marriages or to lay conditions upon them, commonly including a requirement that the children be raised Catholic. The decree proved particularly divisive in Ireland, which its large Protestant minority, contributing indirectly to the subsequent political conflict there and provoking debates in the British House of Commons. The long term effect of &quot;Ne Temere&quot; in Ireland was that Irish Unionism which had had strongholds in Dublin as well as Ulster, but existed to some extent on the entire island of Ireland, declined overall and became virtually exclusively a phenomenon of what is today Northern Ireland. Furthermore, while historically both Protestant Irish nationalists and Catholic Unionists existed, the split over who should rule Northern Ireland eventually came to almost exactly match the confessional divide.

As secular authority challenged the papacy, Pius X became more aggressive. He suspended the &quot;Opera dei Congressi&quot;, which coordinated the work of Catholic associations in Italy, as well as condemning &quot;Le Sillon&quot;, a French social movement that tried to reconcile the Church with liberal political views. He also opposed trade unions that were not exclusively Catholic.

Pius X partially lifted decrees prohibiting Italian Catholics from voting, but he never recognised the Italian government.

== Relations with the Kingdom of Italy ==
Initially, Pius maintained his prisoner in the Vatican stance, but with the rise of socialism he began to allow the &quot;Non Expedit&quot;, which prohibited Catholics from voting, to be relaxed. In 1905, he authorized bishops in his encyclical to offer a dispensation allowing their parishioners to exercise their legislative rights when &quot;the supreme good of society&quot; was at stake.

== Relations with Poland and Russia ==

Under Pius X, the traditionally difficult situation of Polish Catholics in Russia did not improve. Although Nicholas II of Russia issued a decree 22 February 1903, promising religious freedom for the Catholic Church, and in 1905 promulgated a constitution which included religious freedom, the Russian Orthodox Church felt threatened and insisted on stiff interpretations. Papal decrees were not permitted and contacts with the Vatican remained outlawed.

== Activities for the United States ==
In 1903, Pius X negotiated a deal with the United States Government, allowing it to purchase all land owned by Catholic friars in the recently acquired territory of the Philippines for a total of $7 million. The agreement was made between Pius X and Philippine Governor-General William Howard Taft after previous negotiations between Taft and Pope Leo XIII had failed.

In 1908, Pius X lifted the United States out of its missionary status, in recognition of the growth of the American Church. Fifteen new dioceses were created in the US during his pontificate, and he named two American cardinals. He was very popular among American Catholics, often depicted as an ordinary man from a poor family, raised by God to the papal throne.

In 1910, the pope refused an audience with former Vice-president Charles W. Fairbanks, who had addressed the Methodist association in Rome, as well as with former President Theodore Roosevelt, who intended to address the same association.

On 8 July 1914, Pope Pius X approved the request of Cardinal James Gibbons to invoke the patronage of the Immaculate Conception for the construction site of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception in Washington, DC.

== Miracles during the pope&#x27;s lifetime ==
Other than the stories of miracles performed through the pope&#x27;s intercession after his death, there are also stories of miracles performed by the pope during his lifetime.
On one occasion, during a papal audience, Pius X was holding a paralyzed child who wriggled free from his arms and then ran around the room. On another occasion, a couple (who had made confession to him while he was bishop of Mantua) with a two-year-old child with meningitis wrote to the pope and Pius X then wrote back to them to hope and pray. Two days later, the child was cured.

Cardinal Ernesto Ruffini (later the Archbishop of Palermo) had visited the pope after Ruffini was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and the pope had told him to go back to the seminary and that he would be fine. Ruffini gave this story to the investigators of the pontiff&#x27;s cause for canonization.

Once, a man who suffered from a paralyzed arm begged Pius X for his help. Taking his arm in his hand, the pope simply said, &quot;have confidence in the Lord ... only have faith and the Lord will heal you&quot;. At that moment, the man could actually move his arm, calling out to the pope joyfully who simply put a finger to his lips so as not to draw any attention to what had happened, indicating that the man simply hold his peace. Another case saw an Irish girl covered in sores taken to see the pope by her mother. When Pius X saw her, he placed his hand on her head, and the sores completely disappeared. Another case saw a Roman schoolgirl contract a serious foot disease that rendered her crippled since she was only a year old. Through a friend she managed to acquire one of the pope&#x27;s socks and was told that she would be healed if she wore it, which she did. At the moment she placed the sock on, the diseased foot was instantly healed. When Pius X heard about this, he laughed and said, &quot;What a joke! I wear my own socks every day and still I suffer from constant pain in my feet!&quot;

== Other activities ==
In addition to the political defense of the Church, liturgical reforms, anti-modernism, and the beginning of the codification of canon law, the papacy of Pius X saw the reorganisation of the Roman Curia. He also sought to update the education of priests, seminaries and their curricula were reformed. In 1904 Pope Pius X granted permission for diocesan seminarians to attend the College of St. Thomas. He raised the college to the status of &quot;Pontificium&quot; on 2 May 1906, thus making its degrees equivalent to those of the world&#x27;s other pontifical universities. By Apostolic Letter of 8 November 1908, signed by the Supreme Pontiff on 17 November, the college was transformed into the &quot;Collegium Pontificium Internationale Angelicum&quot;. It would become the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot; in 1963.

Pius X published 16 encyclicals; among them was &quot;Vehementer nos&quot; on 11 February 1906, which condemned the 1905 French law on the separation of the State and the Church. Pius X also confirmed, though not infallibly, the existence of Limbo in Catholic theology in his 1905 Catechism, saying that the unbaptized &quot;do not have the joy of God but neither do they suffer... they do not deserve Paradise, but neither do they deserve Hell or Purgatory.&quot; On 23 November 1903, Pius X issued a papal directive, a &quot;motu proprio&quot;, that banned women from singing in church choirs (i.e. the architectural choir).

In the Prophecy of St. Malachy, the collection of 112 prophecies about the popes, Pius X appears as &quot;Ignis Ardens&quot; or &quot;Ardent Fire&quot;.

== Declaring the tango &quot;off-limits&quot; ==
In November 1913, Pope Pius X declared tango dancing as immoral and off-limits to Catholics. Supporters of the dance fabricated a story that the pope had witnessed a demonstration of the dance and recanted his opinion, but the Vatican quickly shot that down as a falsehood.

== Opposition to Zionism ==
On 26 January 1904, Pius X received the founder of Zionism Theodor Herzl in an audience; Herzl had hoped to convince the Vatican to support his movement. Pius X was respectful towards Herzl, but would not support the establishment of a modern State of Israel, citing the refusal of the Jewish people to acknowledge Jesus as the biblical Messiah.

== Canonizations and beatifications ==
Pius X beatified a total of 131 individuals (including groups of martyrs and those by recognition of &quot;cultus&quot;) and canonized four. Those beatified during his pontificate included Marie-Geneviève Meunier (1906), Rose-Chrétien de la Neuville (1906), Valentin de Berriochoa (1906), Clair of Nantes (1907), Zdislava Berka (1907), John of Ruysbroeck (1908), Andrew Nam Thung (1909), Agatha Lin (1909), Agnes De (1909), Joan of Arc (1909), and John Eudes (1909). Those canonized by him were Alexander Sauli (1904), Gerard Majella (1904), Clement Mary Hofbauer (1909), and Joseph Oriol (1909).

In 1908 Pope Pius X named John Chrysostom a patron saint of preachers.

== Consistories ==
Pius X created 50 cardinals in seven consistories held during his pontificate which included noted figures of the Church during that time such as Désiré-Joseph Mercier (1907) and Pietro Gasparri (1907). In 1911, he increased American representation in the cardinalate based on the fact that the United States was expanding; the pope also named one cardinal &quot;in pectore&quot; (António Mendes Belo, whom the media accurately speculated on) in 1911 whose name he later revealed in 1914. Pius X also named as a cardinal Giacomo della Chiesa, his immediate successor, Pope Benedict XV.

Among the cardinals whom he nominated came the first Brazilian-born (and the first Latin American-born; Joaquim Arcoverde de Albuquerque Cavalcanti) and the first from the Netherlands (Willem Marinus van Rossum) since 1523. The consistory of 1911 was the largest number of cardinals elevated at a single consistory in roughly a century.

In 1911, the pope reportedly wished to elevate Diomede Panici to the cardinalate; however, Panici died before the promotion ever took place. Furthermore, this came after Panici was originally considered but passed for the elevation by Pope Leo XIII who even had considered elevating Panici&#x27;s brother. In the 1914 consistory, Pius X considered naming the Capuchin friar Armando Pietro Sabadel to the cardinalate; however, Sabadel declined the pope&#x27;s invitation.

==Death and burial==

In 1913, Pope Pius X suffered a heart attack, and subsequently lived in the shadow of poor health. In 1914, the pope fell ill on the Feast of the Assumption of Mary (15 August 1914); it was an illness from which he would not recover, and it was reported that he suffered from a fever and lung complications. His condition was worsened by the events leading to the outbreak of World War I (1914–1918), which reportedly sent the 79-year-old into a state of melancholy.

While the pope&#x27;s condition was classified as serious, alarming symptoms did not develop until 19 August. While Pius X spent most of that day in and out of consciousness, he said at one stage, &quot;In ancient times, the pope by a word might have stayed the slaughter, but now he is impotent&quot;. The pope shortly after received the Last Rites and eventually, an old bronchial infection that the pope had previously had in years past returned, further hastening his decline. The disease which he has been suffering extended to the bronchial tree resulting in pneumonia that killed him.

He died at 1:20am on Thursday, 20 August 1914, only a few hours after the death of Jesuit leader Franz Xavier Wernz, and on the very day when German forces marched into Brussels. In a moment of lucidity just moments before he died, Pius X is reported to have said: &quot;Now I begin to think the end is approaching. The Almighty in His inexhaustible goodness wishes to spare me the horrors which Europe is undergoing&quot;. His sister, Anna, was praying at his bedside when Pius X died. The pope&#x27;s last act of life was to kiss the little crucifix that he had clasped in his hands at around 1:15am.

Pius X was buried in a simple and unadorned tomb in the crypt below Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica. His body was laid in state on 21 August in red pontifical vestments and then interred following the Requiem Mass following his coffin lying in state on a large catafalque in the Sistine Chapel. His original tombstone bore the inscription: &quot;Pope Pius X, poor and yet rich, gentle and humble of heart, unconquerable champion of the Catholic Faith, whose constant endeavor it was to renew all things in Christ&quot;. Papal physicians had been in the habit of removing organs to aid the embalming process. Pius X expressly prohibited this in his burial and successive popes have continued this tradition. Pius X&#x27;s tomb is located near the tombs of both Pope John XXIII and Pope John Paul II under the altar of the Presentation.

He is succeeded by Giacomo della Chiesa, who was known as Pope Benedict XV.

== Exhumation ==
On May 19, 1944, the body of Pius X was exhumed for inspection as part of the beatification process, during which the remains were found to be miraculously incorrupt. In 1959, the remains of the late pope were sent, with the permission of Pope John XXIII (himself a former Patriarch of Venice), to Venice in 1959. Before the remains were taken to Venice via a train on 11 April, Pope John XXIII led a small prayer service alongside some other cardinals. The body was exposed for the veneration of the faithful at St Mark&#x27;s Basilica for one month (12 April–10 May) before it was returned to the late pope&#x27;s original resting place, with Cardinal Giovanni Urbani acting as the papal legate for the month-long event.

==Canonization==
Although Pius X&#x27;s canonization took place in 1954, the events leading up to it began immediately with his death. A letter of 24 September 1916 by Monsignor Leo, Bishop of Nicotera and Tropea, referred to Pius X as &quot;a great Saint and a great Pope.&quot; To accommodate the large number of pilgrims seeking access to his tomb, more than the crypt would hold, &quot;a small metal cross was set into the floor of the basilica,&quot; which read &quot;Pius Papa X&quot;, &quot;so that the faithful might kneel down directly above the tomb&quot;. Masses were held near his tomb until 1930.

Devotion to Pius X between the two world wars remained high. On 14 February 1923, in honor of the 20th anniversary of his accession to the papacy, the first moves toward his canonization began with the formal appointment of those who would carry out his cause. The event was marked by the erecting of a monument in his memory in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. On 19 August 1939, Pope Pius XII (1939–58) delivered a tribute to Pius X at Castel Gandolfo. On 12 February 1943, a further development of Pius X&#x27;s cause was achieved, when he was declared to have displayed heroic virtues, gaining therefore the title &quot;Venerable&quot;.

On 19 May 1944, Pius X&#x27;s coffin was exhumed and was taken to the Chapel of the Holy Crucifix in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica for the canonical examination.
Upon opening the coffin, the examiners found the body of Pius X remarkably well preserved, despite the fact that he had died 30 years before and had made wishes not to be embalmed. According to Jerome Dai-Gal, &quot;all of the body&quot; of Pius X &quot;was in an excellent state of conservation&quot;. At the canonical recognition of his mortal body were present the Italian cardinals Alfredo Ottaviani and Nicola Canali.

After the examination and the end of the apostolic process towards Pius X&#x27;s cause, Pius XII bestowed the title of Venerable Servant of God upon Pius X. His body was exposed for 45 days (Rome was liberated by the Allies during this time), before being placed back in his tomb.

Following this, the process towards beatification began, and investigations by the Sacred Congregation of Rites (SCR) into miracles performed by intercessory work of Pius X took place. The SCR would eventually recognize two miracles. The first involved Marie-Françoise Deperras, a nun who had bone cancer and was cured on 7 December 1928 during a novena in which a relic of Pius X was placed on her chest. The second involved the nun Benedetta De Maria, who had cancer, and in a novena started in 1938, she eventually touched a relic statue of Pius X and was cured.

Pope Pius XII officially approved the two miracles on 11 February 1951; and on 4 March, Pius XII, in his &quot;De Tuto&quot;, declared that the Church could continue in the beatification of Pius X. His beatification took place on 3 June 1951 at St. Peter&#x27;s before 23 cardinals, hundreds of bishops and archbishops, and a crowd of 100,000 faithful. During his beatification decree, Pius XII referred to Pius X as &quot;Pope of the Eucharist&quot;, in honor of Pius X&#x27;s expansion of the rite to children.

The cause for Pius X&#x27;s canonization was opened on 24 November 1951. On 17 February 1952, Pius X&#x27;s body was transferred from its tomb to the Vatican basilica and placed under the altar of the Chapel of the Presentation in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. The pontiff&#x27;s body lies within a glass and bronze-work sarcophagus for the faithful to see.

On 29 May 1954, less than three years after his beatification, Pius X was canonized, following the SCR&#x27;s recognition of two more miracles. The first involved Francesco Belsami, an attorney from Naples who had a pulmonary abscess, who was cured upon placing a picture of Pope Pius X upon his chest. The second miracle involved Sr. Maria Ludovica Scorcia, a nun who was afflicted with a serious neurotropic virus, and who, upon several novenas, was entirely cured. The canonization Mass was presided over by Pius XII at Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica before a crowd of about 800,000 of the faithful and Church officials at St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. Pius X became the first pope to be canonized since Pius V in 1712.

His canonization ceremony was taped and recorded by television news broadcasters, including NBC.

Prayer cards often depict the sanctified pontiff with instruments of Holy Communion. In addition to being celebrated as the &quot;Pope of the Blessed Sacrament&quot;, Pius X is also the patron saint of emigrants from Treviso. He is honored in numerous parishes in Italy, Germany, Belgium, Canada, and the United States.

The number of parishes, schools, seminaries and retreat houses named after him in Western countries is very large, partly because he was very well known, and his beatification and canonization in the early 1950s was during a period of time following World War II when there was a great deal of new construction in cities and population growth in the era of the baby boom, thus leading to Catholic institutional expansion that correlated with the growing society.

Pius X&#x27;s feast day was assigned in 1955 to 3 September, to be celebrated as a Double. It remained thus for 15 years. In the 1960 calendar, the rank was changed to Third-Class Feast. The rank in the General Roman Calendar since 1969 is that of Memorial and the feast day is obligatorily celebrated on 21 August, closer to the day of his death (20 August, impeded by the feast day of St Bernard).

The Confraternity of Christian Doctrine was a big supporter of his canonization, partly because he had ordained the need for its existence in every diocese and because it had received a great deal of episcopal criticism, and it was thought that by canonizing the pope who gave them their mandate, this would help inoculate against this criticism. They initiated a prayer crusade for his canonization that achieved the participation of over two million names.

After the Pope&#x27;s canonization, another miracle is said to have taken place when a Christian family activist named Clem Lane suffered a major heart attack and was placed in an oxygen tent, where he was given extreme unction. A relic of the Pope was placed over his tent, and he recovered to the great surprise of his doctors. A sister of Loretto at Webster College in St Louis, Missouri, claimed that her priest brother had been cured through the Pope&#x27;s intercession as well.
==Papal coat of arms==
The personal papal arms of Pius X are composed of the traditional elements of all papal heraldry before Pope Benedict XVI: the shield, the papal tiara, and the keys, symbolizing papal authority.

The shield is charged in two parts, as it is &quot;per fess&quot;. In upper shield (&quot;chief&quot;) shows the arms of the Patriarch of Venice, which was Pius X&#x27;s see from 1893 to 1903. It consists of the Lion of Saint Mark proper and haloed in silver upon a silver-white background, displaying a book with the inscription of &quot;&quot; on the left page and &quot;&quot; on the right page. This means &quot;Peace to you, Mark, my evangelist&quot;, the motto of Venice as the final resting place of Mark the Evangelist; however, the arms of the Republic of Venice have red background. Previous Patriarchs of Venice had combined their personal arms with these arms of the Patriarchate. The same &quot;chief&quot; can be seen in the arms of the later popes who were Patriarchs of Venice upon election to the See of Rome, John XXIII and John Paul I. Renditions of this part of Pius X&#x27;s arms depict the lion either with or without a sword, and sometimes only one side of the book is written on.

The lower shield displays the arms of Pius X as Bishop of Mantua: an anchor proper cast into a stormy sea (the blue and silver wavy lines), lit up by a single six-pointed star of gold. These were inspired by Hebrews Chapter 6, Versicle 19, (English: &quot;The hope we have is the sure and steadfast anchor of the soul&quot;) Bishop Sarto had said, &quot;hope is the sole companion of my life, the greatest support in uncertainty, the strongest power in situations of weakness.&quot;

Although not present upon his arms, the most famous motto of Pius X was: &quot;Instaurare omnia in Christo&quot; (English: &quot;To restore all things in Christ&quot;), allegedly his last words before his death.

==In fiction==
The life of Pope Pius X is depicted in the 1951 movie &quot;Gli uomini non-guardano il cielo&quot; by Umberto Scarpelli. The movie is centered on the year 1914, as the Pope grieves over the threat that is incumbent and is consoled by his nephew.

A satirical depiction of Pope Pius X is presented in Flann O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s novel &quot;The Hard Life&quot;, as the Irish characters travel from Dublin to Rome and gain a personal interview with the Pope, which ends very badly.

==In poetry==
In the poem &quot;Zone&quot; by Guillaume Apollinaire, Pope Pius X is referred to as , the most modern European.

<doc id="59207" wikidata="Q162135" url="?curid=59207" title="Pope Gelasius I">
<text>Pope Gelasius I was the bishop of Rome from 1 March 492 to his death on 19 November 496. Gelasius was a prolific author whose style placed him on the cusp between Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages. Some scholars have argued that his predecessor Felix III may have employed him to draft papal documents, although this is not certain.

During his pontificate he called for strict Catholic orthodoxy, more assertively demanded obedience to papal authority, and, consequently, increased the tension between the Western and Eastern Churches. Surprisingly, he also had cordial relations with the Ostrogoths, who were Arians (i.e. Non-trinitarian Christians), and therefore perceived as heretics from the perspective of Nicene Christians.

== Place of birth ==
There is some confusion regarding where Gelasius was born: according to the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot; he was born in Africa (&quot;natione Afer&quot;), while in a letter addressed to the Roman Emperor Anastasius he stated that he was &quot;born a Roman&quot; (&quot;Romanus natus&quot;). J. Conant opined that the latter assertion probably merely denotes that he was born in Roman Africa before the Vandals invaded it.

== Acacian schism ==
The papal election of Gelasius on 1 March 492 was a gesture of continuity: Gelasius inherited the conflicts of Pope Felix III with Eastern Roman Emperor Anastasius and the patriarch of Constantinople and exacerbated them by insisting on the obliteration of the name of the deceased Patriarch Acacius of Constantinople from the diptychs, in spite of every ecumenical gesture by the contemporaneous Patriarch Euphemius (&quot;q. v.&quot; for details of the Acacian schism).

The split with the Emperor and the Patriarch of Constantinople was inevitable, from the Western view, because they adopted the Monophysite heresy of Jesus Christ having only a Divine nature. Gelasius authored the book &quot;De duabus in Christo naturis&quot; (&quot;On the dual nature of Christ&quot;), which described Catholic doctrine in the matter. Thus Gelasius, for all the conservative Latinity of his style of writing, was on the cusp of Late Antiquity and the Early Middle Ages.

During the Acacian schism, Gelasius advocated the primacy of the See of Rome over the universal Church, both East and West, and he presented this doctrine in terms that became the model for successive popes, who also claimed papal supremacy because of their succession to the papacy from the first supreme pontiff, Peter the Apostle.

In 494, Gelasius authored the very influential letter &quot;Duo sunt&quot; to Anastasius on the subject of the relation of Church and state, which letter had political impact for almost a millennium after.

== Suppression of the Lupercalia ==

Closer to home, after a long contest Gelasius finally suppressed the ancient Roman festival of the Lupercalia, which had persisted for several generations among a nominally Christian population. Gelasius&#x27; letter to the Senator Andromachus treated the primary contentions of the controversy and incidentally provided some details of the festival, which combined fertility and purification, that might have been lost otherwise. Although the Lupercalia was a festival of purification, which had given its name &quot;&quot;dies februatus&quot;, from &quot;februare&quot;&quot; (&quot;to purify&quot;), to the month of February, it was unrelated to the Feast of the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary, also commonly denominated &quot;Candlemas&quot;, which latter feast commemorates the fulfillment of the Holy Family&#x27;s ceremonial obligations pursuant to Mosaic law 40 days after the birth of the first son. In the instance of the Holy Family, that occurred 40 days after Christmas, on 2 February.

== Death ==
After a brief yet dynamic ministry, Gelasius died on 19 November AD 496. His feast day is 21 November, the anniversary of his interment, not his death.

== Works ==
Gelasius was one of the most prolific authors of the early bishops of Rome. Over 100 Gelasian letters survive, although 49 of these are fragmentary, some as short as several lines. Additionally, 6 treatises are extant that bear the name of Gelasius. According to Cassiodorus, the reputation of Gelasius attracted to his name other works not by him. Although his dogmatic letters connected to the Acacian Schism were widely circulated in late antiquity (and have been the focus of much scholarly interest), the majority of Gelasius&#x27; letters were in fact concerned with the administration of the church of suburbicarian Italy.

===&quot;Decretum Gelasianum&quot;===

The most famous of pseudo-Gelasian works is the list &quot;De libris recipiendis et non recipiendis&quot; (&quot;On books to be received and not to be received&quot;), also denominated the &quot;Decretum Gelasianum&quot;, which is believed to be connected to the pressure for orthodoxy during his pontificate and intended to be read as a decretal by Gelasius on the canonical and apocryphal books, which internal evidence reveals to be of later date. Thus the determination of the canon of Sacred Scripture has traditionally been attributed to Gelasius.

===&quot;Gelasian Sacramentary&quot;===

In the Latin Catholic tradition, the pseudo &quot;Gelasian Sacramentary&quot; is in fact a liturgical book that was derived from Roman sources and transcribed, with inclusion of native Gallican liturgical elements, near Paris in the middle of the 8th century AD. While including the texts of some prayers that Gelasius composed, he was not a principal author or compiler of the book. The manuscript (Vatican, Vatican Library, Reg. lat. 316 + Paris, National Library, ms. lat. 7193, fol. 41–56) is actually titled the &quot;Liber sacramentorum Romanae ecclesiae&quot; (&quot;Book of Sacraments of the Roman Church&quot;). The attribution to Gelasius is premised in part at least on the chronicle of the Supreme Pontiffs that is denominated the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, which states of Gelasius that he &quot;fecit etiam et sacramentorum praefationes et orationes cauto sermone et epistulas fidei delimato sermone multas&quot; (&quot;he also made prefaces to the sacraments and prayers in careful language and many epistles in polished language regarding the faith&quot;). An old tradition linked the book to Gelasius, apparently based on the ascription of Walafrid Strabo to him of what evidently is this book.

== Legacy ==

Cardinal Giuseppe Maria Tomasi quoted a portion of a missal that was attributed to Gelasius in the Mass that was entitled &#x27;Contra obloquentes&#x27; and published it. The section read: &quot;Grant, We beseech Thee, O Lord, that we do not trouble ourselves about the contradiction of spurious minds, but once that very wickedness has been spurned let us pray that you suffer us neither to be frightened by the unjust criticisms, nor to be attracted to the insidious flatteries, but rather to love that which Thou dost command ...&quot;. In 1751, Pope Benedict XIV published this quotation within his Apostolic Constitution &quot;Providas&quot; that attacked freemasonry.

<doc id="59209" wikidata="Q173869" url="?curid=59209" title="Alfred, Lord Tennyson">
<text>Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson (; 6 August 1809 – 6 October 1892) was an English poet. He was the Poet Laureate during much of Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign. In 1829, Tennyson was awarded the Chancellor&#x27;s Gold Medal at Cambridge for one of his first pieces, &quot;Timbuktu&quot;. He published his first solo collection of poems, &quot;Poems, Chiefly Lyrical&quot;, in 1830. &quot;Claribel&quot; and &quot;Mariana&quot;, which remain some of Tennyson&#x27;s most celebrated poems, were included in this volume. Although described by some critics as overly sentimental, his poems ultimately proved popular and brought Tennyson to the attention of well-known writers of the day, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Tennyson&#x27;s early poetry, with its medievalism and powerful visual imagery, was a major influence on the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.

Tennyson also focused on short lyrics, such as &quot;Break, Break, Break&quot;, &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;, &quot;Tears, Idle Tears&quot;, and &quot;Crossing the Bar&quot;. Much of his verse was based on classical mythological themes, such as &quot;Ulysses&quot; and &quot;The Lotos-Eaters&quot;. &quot;In Memoriam A.H.H.&quot; was written to commemorate his friend Arthur Hallam, a fellow poet and student at Trinity College, Cambridge, after he died of a stroke at the age of 22. Tennyson also wrote notable blank verse, including &quot;Idylls of the King&quot;, &quot;Ulysses&quot;, and &quot;Tithonus&quot;. During his career, Tennyson attempted drama, but his plays enjoyed little success.

A number of phrases from Tennyson&#x27;s work have become commonplace in the English language, including &quot;Nature, red in tooth and claw&quot; (&quot;In Memoriam A.H.H.&quot;), &quot;&#x27;Tis better to have loved and lost / Than never to have loved at all&quot;, &quot;Theirs not to reason why, / Theirs but to do and die&quot;, &quot;My strength is as the strength of ten, / Because my heart is pure&quot;, &quot;To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield&quot;, &quot;Knowledge comes, but Wisdom lingers&quot;, and &quot;The old order changeth, yielding place to new&quot;. He is the ninth most frequently quoted writer in &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Tennyson was born on 6 August 1809 in Somersby, Lincolnshire, England. He was born into a successful middle-class family of minor landowning status distantly descended from John Savage, 2nd Earl Rivers, and Francis Leke, 1st Earl of Scarsdale. His father, George Clayton Tennyson (1778–1831), was an Anglican clergyman who served as rector of Somersby (1807–1831), also rector of Benniworth (1802–1831) and Bag Enderby, and vicar of Grimsby (1815). He raised a large family and &quot;was a man of superior abilities and varied attainments, who tried his hand with fair success in architecture, painting, music, and poetry. He was comfortably well off for a country clergyman, and his shrewd money management enabled the family to spend summers at Mablethorpe and Skegness on the eastern coast of England&quot;. George Clayton Tennyson was elder son of attorney and MP George Tennyson (1749/50-1835), JP, DL, of Bayons Manor and Usselby Hall, who had also inherited the estates of his mother&#x27;s family, the Claytons, and married Mary, daughter and heiress of John Turner, of Caistor, Lincolnshire. George Clayton Tennyson was however pushed into a career in the church and passed over as heir in favour of his younger brother, Charles Tennyson d&#x27;Eyncourt. Alfred Tennyson&#x27;s mother, Elizabeth (1781–1865), was the daughter of Stephen Fytche (1734–1799), vicar of St. James Church, Louth (1764) and rector of Withcall (1780), a small village between Horncastle and Louth. Tennyson&#x27;s father &quot;carefully attended to the education and training of his children&quot;.

Tennyson and two of his elder brothers were writing poetry in their teens and a collection of poems by all three was published locally when Alfred was only 17. One of those brothers, Charles Tennyson Turner, later married Louisa Sellwood, the younger sister of Alfred&#x27;s future wife; the other was Frederick Tennyson. Another of Tennyson&#x27;s brothers, Edward Tennyson, was institutionalised at a private asylum.

The noted psychologist William James, in his book &quot;The Varieties of Religious Experience&quot;, quoted Tennyson concerning a type of experience with which Tennyson was familiar: &quot;A kind of waking trance I have frequently had, quite up from boyhood, when I have been all alone. This has often come upon me through repeating my own name. All at once, as it were out of the intensity of the consciousness of individuality, individuality itself seemed to dissolve and fade away into boundless being, and this was not a confused state but the clearest, the surest of the sure, utterly beyond words…&quot;

===Education and first publication===
Tennyson was a student of King Edward VI Grammar School, Louth from 1816 to 1820. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge, in 1827, where he joined a secret society called the Cambridge Apostles. A portrait of Tennyson by George Frederic Watts is in Trinity&#x27;s collection.

At Cambridge, Tennyson met Arthur Hallam and William Henry Brookfield, who became his closest friends. His first publication was a collection of &quot;his boyish rhymes and those of his elder brother Charles&quot; entitled &quot;Poems by Two Brothers&quot;, published in 1827.

In 1829, Tennyson was awarded the Chancellor&#x27;s Gold Medal at Cambridge for one of his first pieces, &quot;Timbuktu&quot;. Reportedly, &quot;it was thought to be no slight honour for a young man of twenty to win the chancellor&#x27;s gold medal&quot;. He published his first solo collection of poems, &quot;Poems Chiefly Lyrical&quot; in 1830. &quot;Claribel&quot; and &quot;Mariana&quot;, which later took their place among Tennyson&#x27;s most celebrated poems, were included in this volume. Although decried by some critics as overly sentimental, his verse soon proved popular and brought Tennyson to the attention of well-known writers of the day, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

===Return to Lincolnshire, second publication, Epping Forest===
In the spring of 1831, Tennyson&#x27;s father died, requiring him to leave Cambridge before taking his degree. He returned to the rectory, where he was permitted to live for another six years and shared responsibility for his widowed mother and the family. Arthur Hallam came to stay with his family during the summer and became engaged to Tennyson&#x27;s sister, Emilia Tennyson.

In 1833 Tennyson published his second book of poetry, which notably included the first version of &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot;. The volume met heavy criticism, which so discouraged Tennyson that he did not publish again for ten years, although he did continue to write. That same year, Hallam died suddenly and unexpectedly after suffering a cerebral haemorrhage while on a holiday in Vienna. Hallam&#x27;s death had a profound effect on Tennyson and inspired several poems, including &quot;In the Valley of Cauteretz&quot; and &quot;In Memoriam A.H.H.&quot;, a long poem detailing the &quot;Way of the Soul&quot;.

Tennyson and his family were allowed to stay in the rectory for some time, but later moved to Beech Hill Park, High Beach, deep within Epping Forest, Essex, about 1837. Tennyson&#x27;s son recalled: &quot;there was a pond in the park on which in winter my father might be seen skating, sailing about on the ice in his long blue cloak. He liked the nearness of London, whither he resorted to see his friends, but he could not stay in town even for a night, his mother being in such a nervous state that he did not like to leave her...&quot;. Tennyson befriended a Dr Allen, who ran a nearby asylum whose patients then included the poet John Clare. An unwise investment in Dr Allen&#x27;s ecclesiastical wood-carving enterprise soon led to the loss of much of the family fortune, and led to a bout of serious depression. According to Tennyson&#x27;s grandson Sir Charles Tennyson, Tennyson met Thomas Carlyle in 1839, if not earlier. The pair began a lifelong friendship, and were famous smoking companions. Some of Tennyson&#x27;s work even bears the influence of Carlyle and his ideas. Tennyson moved to London in 1840 and lived for a time at Chapel House, Twickenham.

===Third publication===
On 14 May 1842, while living modestly in London, Tennyson published the two volume &quot;Poems&quot;, of which the first included works already published and the second was made up almost entirely of new poems. They met with immediate success; poems from this collection, such as &quot;Locksley Hall&quot;, &quot;Break, Break, Break&quot;, and &quot;Ulysses&quot;, and a new version of &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot;, have met enduring fame. &quot;The Princess: A Medley&quot;, a satire on women&#x27;s education that came out in 1847, was also popular for its lyrics. W. S. Gilbert later adapted and parodied the piece twice: in &quot;The Princess&quot; (1870) and in &quot;Princess Ida&quot; (1884).

It was in 1850 that Tennyson reached the pinnacle of his career, finally publishing his masterpiece, &quot;In Memoriam A.H.H.&quot;, dedicated to Hallam. Later the same year, he was appointed Poet Laureate, succeeding William Wordsworth. In the same year (on 13 June), Tennyson married Emily Sellwood, whom he had known since childhood, in the village of Shiplake. They had two sons, Hallam Tennyson (b. 11 August 1852)—named after his friend—and Lionel (b. 16 March 1854).

Tennyson rented Farringford House on the Isle of Wight in 1853, eventually buying it in 1856. He eventually found that there were too many tourists who pestered him in Farringford, so he moved to Aldworth, in West Sussex in 1869. However, he retained Farringford, and regularly returned there to spend the winters.

===Poet Laureate===

In 1850, after William Wordsworth&#x27;s death and Samuel Rogers&#x27; refusal, Tennyson was appointed to the position of Poet Laureate; Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Leigh Hunt had also been considered. He held the position until his death in 1892, the longest tenure of any laureate. Tennyson fulfilled the requirements of this position, such as by authoring a poem of greeting to Princess Alexandra of Denmark when she arrived in Britain to marry the future King Edward VII. In 1855, Tennyson produced one of his best-known works, &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;, a dramatic tribute to the British cavalrymen involved in an ill-advised charge on 25 October 1854, during the Crimean War. Other esteemed works written in the post of Poet Laureate include &quot;Ode on the Death of the Duke of Wellington&quot; and &quot;Ode Sung at the Opening of the International Exhibition&quot;.

Tennyson declined a baronetcy offered him by Disraeli in 1865 and 1868, finally accepting a peerage in 1883 at Gladstone&#x27;s earnest solicitation. In 1884 Victoria created him Baron Tennyson, of Aldworth in the County of Sussex and of Freshwater in the Isle of Wight. He took his seat in the House of Lords on 11 March 1884.

Tennyson also wrote a substantial quantity of unofficial political verse, from the bellicose &quot;Form, Riflemen, Form&quot;, on the French crisis of 1859 and the Creation of the Volunteer Force, to &quot;Steersman, be not precipitate in thine act/of steering&quot;, deploring Gladstone&#x27;s Home Rule Bill. Tennyson&#x27;s family were Whigs by tradition and Tennyson&#x27;s own politics fitted the Whig mould, although he would also vote for the Liberal Party after the Whigs dissolved. Tennyson believed that society should progress through gradual and steady reform, not revolution, and this attitude was reflected in his attitude toward universal suffrage, which he did not outright reject, but recommended only after the masses had been properly educated and adjusted to self-government. Upon passage of the Reform Act 1832, Tennyson broke into a local church to ring the bells in celebration.

Virginia Woolf wrote a play called &quot;Freshwater&quot;, showing Tennyson as host to his friends Julia Margaret Cameron and G. F. Watts. Colonel George Edward Gouraud, Thomas Edison&#x27;s European agent, made sound recordings of Tennyson reading his own poetry, late in his life. They include recordings of &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot;, and excerpts from &quot;The splendour falls&quot; (from The Princess), &quot;Come into the garden&quot; (from Maud), &quot;Ask me no more&quot;, &quot;Ode on the death of the Duke of Wellington&quot; and &quot;Lancelot and Elaine&quot;. The sound quality is poor, as wax cylinder recordings usually are.

Towards the end of his life Tennyson revealed that his &quot;religious beliefs also defied convention, leaning towards agnosticism and pandeism&quot;: In a characteristically Victorian manner, Tennyson combines a deep interest in contemporary science with an unorthodox, even idiosyncratic, Christian belief. Famously, he wrote in &quot;In Memoriam&quot;: &quot;There lives more faith in honest doubt, believe me, than in half the creeds.&quot; In &quot;Maud&quot;, 1855, he wrote: &quot;The churches have killed their Christ&quot;. In &quot;Locksley Hall Sixty Years After&quot;, Tennyson wrote: &quot;Christian love among the churches look&#x27;d the twin of heathen hate.&quot; In his play, &quot;Becket&quot;, he wrote: &quot;We are self-uncertain creatures, and we may, Yea, even when we know not, mix our spites and private hates with our defence of Heaven&quot;. Tennyson recorded in his &quot;Diary&quot; (p. 127): &quot;I believe in Pantheism of a sort&quot;. His son&#x27;s biography confirms that Tennyson was an unorthodox Christian, noting that Tennyson praised Giordano Bruno and Spinoza on his deathbed, saying of Bruno, &quot;His view of God is in some ways mine&quot;, in 1892.

Tennyson continued writing into his eighties. He died on 6 October 1892 at Aldworth, aged 83. He was buried at Westminster Abbey. A memorial was erected in All Saints&#x27; Church, Freshwater. His last words were, &quot;Oh that press will have me now!&quot;. He left an estate of £57,206. Tennyson Down and the Tennyson Trail on the Isle of Wight are named after him, and a monument to him stands on top of Tennyson Down. Lake Tennyson in New Zealand&#x27;s high country, named by Frederick Weld, is assumed to be named after Lord Tennyson.

He was succeeded as 2nd Baron Tennyson by his son, Hallam, who produced an authorised biography of his father in 1897, and was later the second Governor-General of Australia.

==Tennyson and the Queen==
Although Albert, Prince Consort, was largely responsible for Tennyson&#x27;s appointment as Laureate, Queen Victoria became an ardent admirer of Tennyson&#x27;s work, writing in her diary that she was &quot;much soothed &amp; pleased&quot; by reading &quot;In Memoriam A.H.H.&quot; after Albert&#x27;s death.

The two met twice, first in April 1862, when Victoria wrote in her diary, &quot;very peculiar looking, tall, dark, with a fine head, long black flowing hair &amp; a beard, oddly dressed, but there is no affectation about him.&quot;

Tennyson met her a second time just over two decades later, on 7 August 1883, and the Queen told him what a comfort &quot;In Memoriam A.H.H.&quot; had been.

==The art of Tennyson&#x27;s poetry==

As source material for his poetry, Tennyson used a wide range of subject matter ranging from medieval legends to classical myths and from domestic situations to observations of nature. The influence of John Keats and other Romantic poets published before and during his childhood is evident from the richness of his imagery and descriptive writing. He also handled rhythm masterfully. The insistent beat of &quot;Break, Break, Break&quot; emphasises the relentless sadness of the subject matter. Tennyson&#x27;s use of the musical qualities of words to emphasise his rhythms and meanings is sensitive. The language of &quot;I come from haunts of coot and hern&quot; lilts and ripples like the brook in the poem and the last two lines of &quot;Come down O maid from yonder mountain height&quot; illustrate his telling combination of onomatopoeia, alliteration, and assonance:

Tennyson was a craftsman who polished and revised his manuscripts extensively, to the point where his efforts at self-editing were described by his contemporary Robert Browning as &quot;insane&quot;, symptomatic of &quot;mental infirmity&quot;. His complex compositional practice and frequent redrafting also demonstrates a dynamic relationship between images and words, as can be seen in the many notebooks he worked in. Few poets have used such a variety of styles with such an exact understanding of metre; like many Victorian poets, he experimented in adapting the quantitative metres of Greek and Latin poetry to English. He reflects the Victorian period of his maturity in his feeling for order and his tendency towards moralising. He also reflects a concern common among Victorian writers in being troubled by the conflict between religious faith and expanding scientific knowledge. Tennyson possessed a strong poetic power, which his early readers often attributed to his &quot;Englishness&quot; and his masculinity. Well-known among his longer works are &quot;Maud&quot; and &quot;Idylls of the King&quot;, the latter arguably the most famous Victorian adaptation of the legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. A common thread of grief, melancholy, and loss connects much of his poetry (including &quot;Mariana&quot;, &quot;The Lotos Eaters&quot;, &quot;Tears, Idle Tears&quot;, &quot;In Memoriam&quot;), possibly reflecting Tennyson&#x27;s lifelong struggle with debilitating depression. T. S. Eliot famously described Tennyson as &quot;the saddest of all English poets&quot;, whose technical mastery of verse and language provided a &quot;surface&quot; to his poetry&#x27;s &quot;depths, to the abyss of sorrow&quot;. Other poets such as W. H. Auden maintained a more critical stance, stating that Tennyson was the &quot;stupidest&quot; of all the English poets, adding that: &quot;There was little about melancholia he didn&#x27;t know; there was little else that he did.&quot;

==Influence on Pre-Raphaelite artists==
Tennyson&#x27;s early poetry, with its medievalism and powerful visual imagery, was a major influence on the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. In 1848, Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Holman Hunt made a list of &quot;Immortals&quot;, artistic heroes whom they admired, especially from literature, notably including Keats and Tennyson, whose work would form subjects for PRB paintings. &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot; alone was a subject for Rossetti, Hunt, John William Waterhouse (three versions), and Elizabeth Siddall.

==Tennyson heraldry==
A heraldic achievement of Alfred, Lord Tennyson exists in an 1884 stained-glass window in the Hall of Trinity College, Cambridge, showing arms: 

These are a difference of the arms of Thomas Tenison (1636–1715), Archbishop of Canterbury, themselves a difference of the arms of the 13th-century Denys family of Glamorgan and Siston in Gloucestershire, themselves a difference of the arms of Thomas de Cantilupe (c. 1218–1282), Bishop of Hereford, henceforth the arms of the See of Hereford; the name &quot;Tennyson&quot; signifies &quot;Denys&#x27;s son&quot;, although no connection between the two families is recorded.

==Works==
A list of works by Tennyson follows:

==Musical settings==
Michael William Balfe&#x27;s setting of &quot;Come Into the Garden, Maud&quot; was a popular success in 1857, as sung by the celebrated tenor Sims Reeves. Arthur Somervell&#x27;s &quot;Maud&quot; (1898) used thirteen poems (not all of them complete) for his song cycle, enough &quot;to retain a cogent narrative&quot;. Stephen Banfield believes it is &quot;the nearest an English composer ever came to writing a substantial, Romantic song-cycle&quot;.

Charles Villiers Stanford set &quot;Crossing the Bar&quot; for high voice and piano in April 1880, a year after the poem has been first published. Maude Valérie White (four songs, 1885) and Liza Lehmann (10 songs, 1899) both composed song cycles selecting passages from &quot;In Memoriam&quot;. Roger Quilter set &quot;Now sleeps the crimson petal&quot; (from &quot;The Princess&quot;) for voice and orchestra in 1905. &quot;The splendour falls on castle walls&quot; (also from &quot;The Princess&quot;), has been set by many composers, including Arnold Bax, Benjamin Britten, Cecil Armstrong Gibbs, Gustav Holst, Stanford, Vaughan Williams and Charles Wood. Tennyson deplored the use of unauthorised repetition in song settings, a device used by many composers, and so tried to circumvent this by supplying his own, as in &quot;Break, Break, Break&quot; (set by Sidney Lanier in 1871 and Cyril Rootham in 1906), and the repetition of &quot;dying&quot; in &quot;The splendour falls&quot;, which as Trevor Hold points out, &quot;has been a god-send to every composer who has set it&quot;.

== Popular culture ==
Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; was quoted in the 2012 James Bond film &quot;Skyfall&quot;, with the character M (played by actress Judi Dench) reciting the poem. The film&#x27;s soundtrack also included an accompanying track, composed by Thomas Newman, that is titled &quot;Tennyson&quot;.

<text>Altitude is a distance measurement, usually in the vertical or &quot;up&quot; direction, between a reference datum and a point or object. The exact definition and reference datum varies according to the context (e.g., aviation, geometry, geographical survey, sport, or atmospheric pressure). Although the term &quot;altitude&quot; is commonly used to mean the height above sea level of a location, in geography the term elevation is often preferred for this usage.

In aviation, altitude is typically measured relative to mean sea level or above ground level to ensure safe navigation and flight operations. In geometry and geographical surveys, altitude helps create accurate topographic maps and understand the terrain&#x27;s elevation. For high-altitude trekking and sports, knowing and adapting to altitude is vital for performance and safety. Higher altitudes mean reduced oxygen levels, which can lead to altitude sickness if proper acclimatization measures are not taken.

Vertical distance measurements in the &quot;down&quot; direction are commonly referred to as &quot;depth&quot;.

== In aviation==


The term &quot;altitude&quot; can have several meanings, and is always qualified by explicitly adding a modifier (e.g. &quot;true altitude&quot;), or implicitly through the context of the communication. Parties exchanging altitude information must be clear which definition is being used.

Aviation altitude is measured using either mean sea level (MSL) or local ground level (above ground level, or AGL) as the reference datum.

Pressure altitude divided by 100 feet (30 m) is the flight level, and is used above the transition altitude ( in the US, but may be as low as in other jurisdictions). So when the altimeter reads the country-specific flight level on the standard pressure setting the aircraft is said to be at &quot;Flight level XXX/100&quot; (where XXX is the transition altitude). When flying at a flight level, the altimeter is always set to standard pressure (29.92 inHg or 1013.25 hPa).

On the flight deck, the definitive instrument for measuring altitude is the pressure altimeter, which is an aneroid barometer with a front face indicating distance (feet or metres) instead of atmospheric pressure.

There are several types of altitude in aviation:

* Indicated altitude is the reading on the altimeter when it is set to the local barometric pressure at mean sea level. In UK aviation radiotelephony usage, &quot;the vertical distance of a level, a point or an object considered as a point, measured from mean sea level&quot;; this is referred to over the radio as altitude.(see QNH)
* Absolute altitude is the vertical distance of the aircraft above the terrain over which it is flying. It can be measured using a radar altimeter (or &quot;absolute altimeter&quot;). Also referred to as &quot;radar height&quot; or feet/metres above ground level (AGL).
* True altitude is the actual elevation above mean sea level. It is indicated altitude corrected for non-standard temperature and pressure.
* Height is the vertical distance above a reference point, commonly the terrain elevation. In UK aviation radiotelephony usage, &quot;the vertical distance of a level, a point or an object considered as a point, measured from a specified datum&quot;; this is referred to over the radio as height, where the specified datum is the airfield elevation (see QFE)
* Pressure altitude is the elevation above a standard datum air-pressure plane (typically, 1013.25 millibars or 29.92&quot; Hg). Pressure altitude is used to indicate &quot;flight level&quot; which is the standard for altitude reporting in the U.S. in Class A airspace (above roughly 18,000 feet). Pressure altitude and indicated altitude are the same when the altimeter setting is 29.92&quot; Hg or 1013.25 millibars.
*Density altitude is the altitude corrected for non-ISA International Standard Atmosphere atmospheric conditions. Aircraft performance depends on density altitude, which is affected by barometric pressure, humidity and temperature. On a very hot day, density altitude at an airport (especially one at a high elevation) may be so high as to preclude takeoff, particularly for helicopters or a heavily loaded aircraft.

These types of altitude can be explained more simply as various ways of measuring the altitude:
*Indicated altitude – the altitude shown on the altimeter.
*Absolute altitude – altitude in terms of the distance above the ground directly below
*True altitude – altitude in terms of elevation above sea level
*Height – vertical distance above a certain point
*Pressure altitude – the air pressure in terms of altitude in the International Standard Atmosphere
*Density altitude – the density of the air in terms of altitude in the International Standard Atmosphere in the air

==In satellite orbits==
==In atmospheric studies==
===Atmospheric layers===

The Earth&#x27;s atmosphere is divided into several altitude regions. These regions start and finish at varying heights depending on season and distance from the poles. The altitudes stated below are averages:
* Troposphere: surface to at the poles, at the Equator, ending at the Tropopause
* Stratosphere: Troposphere to 
* Mesosphere: Stratosphere to 
* Thermosphere: Mesosphere to 
* Exosphere: Thermosphere to 

The Kármán line, at an altitude of above sea level, by convention defines represents the demarcation between the atmosphere and space. The thermosphere and exosphere (along with the higher parts of the mesosphere) are regions of the atmosphere that are conventionally defined as space.

===High altitude and low pressure===

Regions on the Earth&#x27;s surface (or in its atmosphere) that are high above mean sea level are referred to as high altitude. High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at above sea level.

At high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.

===Temperature profile===

The temperature profile of the atmosphere is a result of an interaction between radiation and convection. Sunlight in the visible spectrum hits the ground and heats it. The ground then heats the air at the surface. If radiation were the only way to transfer heat from the ground to space, the greenhouse effect of gases in the atmosphere would keep the ground at roughly , and the temperature would decay exponentially with height.

However, when air is hot, it tends to expand, which lowers its density. Thus, hot air tends to rise and transfer heat upward. This is the process of convection. Convection comes to equilibrium when a parcel of air at a given altitude has the same density as its surroundings. Air is a poor conductor of heat, so a parcel of air will rise and fall without exchanging heat. This is known as an adiabatic process, which has a characteristic pressure-temperature curve. As the pressure gets lower, the temperature decreases. The rate of decrease of temperature with elevation is known as the adiabatic lapse rate, which is approximately 9.8 °C per kilometer (or per 1000 feet) of altitude.

The presence of water in the atmosphere complicates the process of convection. Water vapor contains latent heat of vaporization. As air rises and cools, it eventually becomes saturated and cannot hold its quantity of water vapor. The water vapor condenses (forming clouds), and releases heat, which changes the lapse rate from the dry adiabatic lapse rate to the moist adiabatic lapse rate (5.5 °C per kilometer or per 1000 feet).
As an average, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) defines an international standard atmosphere (ISA) with a temperature lapse rate of 6.49 °C per kilometer (3.56 °F per 1,000 feet). The actual lapse rate can vary by altitude and by location.

Finally, only the troposphere (up to approximately of altitude) in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere undergoes notable convection; in the stratosphere, there is little vertical convection.

==Effects on organisms==

===Humans===
Medicine recognizes that altitudes above start to affect humans, and there is no record of humans living at extreme altitudes above for more than two years. As the altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases, which affects humans by reducing the partial pressure of oxygen. The lack of oxygen above can cause serious illnesses such as altitude sickness, high altitude pulmonary edema, and high altitude cerebral edema. The higher the altitude, the more likely are serious effects. The human body can adapt to high altitude by breathing faster, having a higher heart rate, and adjusting its blood chemistry. It can take days or weeks to adapt to high altitude. However, above , (in the &quot;death zone&quot;), altitude acclimatization becomes impossible.

There is a significantly lower overall mortality rate for permanent residents at higher altitudes. Additionally, there is a dose response relationship between increasing elevation and decreasing obesity prevalence in the United States. In addition, the recent hypothesis suggests that high altitude could be protective against Alzheimer&#x27;s disease via action of erythropoietin, a hormone released by kidney in response to hypoxia.
However, people living at higher elevations have a statistically significant higher rate of suicide. The cause for the increased suicide risk is unknown so far.

====Athletes====
For athletes, high altitude produces two contradictory effects on performance. For explosive events (sprints up to 400 metres, long jump, triple jump) the reduction in atmospheric pressure signifies less atmospheric resistance, which generally results in improved athletic performance. For endurance events (races of 5,000 metres or more) the predominant effect is the reduction in oxygen which generally reduces the athlete&#x27;s performance at high altitude. Sports organizations acknowledge the effects of altitude on performance: the International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF), for example, marks record performances achieved at an altitude greater than with the letter &quot;A&quot;.

Athletes also can take advantage of altitude acclimatization to increase their performance. The same changes that help the body cope with high altitude increase performance back at sea level. These changes are the basis of altitude training which forms an integral part of the training of athletes in a number of endurance sports including track and field, distance running, triathlon, cycling and swimming.

===Other organisms===

Decreased oxygen availability and decreased temperature make life at high altitude challenging. Despite these environmental conditions, many species have been successfully adapted at high altitudes. Animals have developed physiological adaptations to enhance oxygen uptake and delivery to tissues which can be used to sustain metabolism. The strategies used by animals to adapt to high altitude depend on their morphology and phylogeny. For example, small mammals face the challenge of maintaining body heat in cold temperatures, due to their small volume to surface area ratio. As oxygen is used as a source of metabolic heat production, the hypobaric hypoxia at high altitudes is problematic.

There is also a general trend of smaller body sizes and lower species richness at high altitudes, likely due to lower oxygen partial pressures. These factors may decrease productivity in high altitude habitats, meaning there will be less energy available for consumption, growth, and activity.

However, some species, such as birds, thrive at high altitude. Birds thrive because of physiological features that are advantageous for high-altitude flight.

<text>Free trade is a trade policy that does not restrict imports or exports. In government, free trade is predominantly advocated by political parties that hold economically liberal positions, while economic nationalist political parties generally support protectionism, the opposite of free trade.

Most nations are today members of the World Trade Organization multilateral trade agreements. States can unilaterally reduce regulations and duties on imports and exports, as well as form bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements. Free trade areas between groups of countries, such as the European Economic Area and the Mercosur open markets, establish a free trade zone among members while creating a protectionist barrier between that free trade area and the rest of the world. Most governments still impose some protectionist policies that are intended to support local employment, such as applying tariffs to imports or subsidies to exports. Governments may also restrict free trade to limit exports of natural resources. Other barriers that may hinder trade include import quotas, taxes and non-tariff barriers, such as regulatory legislation.

Historically, openness to free trade substantially increased from 1815 to the outbreak of World War I. Trade openness increased again during the 1920s, but collapsed (in particular in Europe and North America) during the Great Depression. Trade openness increased substantially again from the 1950s onwards (albeit with a slowdown during the 1973 oil crisis). Economists and economic historians contend that current levels of trade openness are the highest they have ever been.

Economists are generally supportive of free trade. There is a broad consensus among economists that protectionism has a negative effect on economic growth and economic welfare while free trade and the reduction of trade barriers has a positive effect on economic growth and economic stability. However, in the short run, liberalization of trade can cause unequally distributed losses and the economic dislocation of workers in import-competing sectors.

* Unregulated access to markets.
* Unregulated access to market information.
* Inability of firms to distort markets through government-imposed monopoly or oligopoly power.

== Economics ==
=== Economic models ===

Two simple ways to understand the proposed benefits of free trade are through David Ricardo&#x27;s theory of comparative advantage and by analyzing the impact of a tariff or import quota. An economic analysis using the law of supply and demand and the economic effects of a tax can be used to show the theoretical benefits and disadvantages of free trade.

Most economists would recommend that even developing nations should set their tariff rates quite low, but the economist Ha-Joon Chang, a proponent of industrial policy, believes higher levels may be justified in developing nations because the productivity gap between them and developed nations today is much higher than what developed nations faced when they were at a similar level of technological development. Underdeveloped nations today, Chang believes, are weak players in a much more competitive system. Counterarguments to Chang&#x27;s point of view are that the developing countries are able to adopt technologies from abroad whereas developed nations had to create new technologies themselves and that developing countries can sell to export markets far richer than any that existed in the 19th century.

If the chief justification for a tariff is to stimulate infant industries, it must be high enough to allow domestic manufactured goods to compete with imported goods in order to be successful. This theory, known as import substitution industrialization, is largely considered ineffective for currently developing nations.

==== Tariffs ====
The chart at the right analyzes the effect of the imposition of an import tariff on some imaginary good. Prior to the tariff, the price of the good in the world market and hence in the domestic market is Pworld. The tariff increases the domestic price to Ptariff. The higher price causes domestic production to increase from QS1 to QS2 and causes domestic consumption to decline from QC1 to QC2.

This has three effects on societal welfare. Consumers are made worse off because the consumer surplus (green region) becomes smaller. Producers are better off because the producer surplus (yellow region) is made larger. The government also has additional tax revenue (blue region). However, the loss to consumers is greater than the gains by producers and the government. The magnitude of this societal loss is shown by the two pink triangles. Removing the tariff and having free trade would be a net gain for society.

An almost identical analysis of this tariff from the perspective of a net producing country yields parallel results. From that country&#x27;s perspective, the tariff leaves producers worse off and consumers better off, but the net loss to producers is larger than the benefit to consumers (there is no tax revenue in this case because the country being analyzed is not collecting the tariff). Under similar analysis, export tariffs, import quotas and export quotas all yield nearly identical results.

Sometimes consumers are better off and producers worse off and sometimes consumers are worse off and producers are better off, but the imposition of trade restrictions causes a net loss to society because the losses from trade restrictions are larger than the gains from trade restrictions. Free trade creates winners and losers, but theory and empirical evidence show that the gains from free trade are larger than the losses.

A 2021 study found that across 151 countries over the period 1963–2014, &quot;tariff increases are associated with persistent, economically and statistically significant declines in domestic output and productivity, as well as higher unemployment and inequality, real exchange rate appreciation, and insignificant changes to the trade balance.&quot;

==== Technology and innovation ====
Economic models indicate that free trade leads to greater technology adoption and innovation.

==== Productivity and welfare ====
A 2023 study in &quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot; found that reductions in trade costs since 1980 caused increases in agricultural productivity, food consumption and welfare across the world. The welfare gains were particularly large in some developing countries.

=== Trade diversion ===
According to mainstream economics theory, the selective application of free trade agreements to some countries and tariffs on others can lead to economic inefficiency through the process of trade diversion. It is efficient for a good to be produced by the country which is the lowest cost producer, but this does not always take place if a high cost producer has a free trade agreement while the low cost producer faces a high tariff. Applying free trade to the high cost producer and not the low cost producer as well can lead to trade diversion and a net economic loss. This reason is why many economists place such high importance on negotiations for global tariff reductions, such as the Doha Round.

== Opinions ==
=== Economist opinions ===
The literature analyzing the economics of free trade is rich. Economists have done extensive work on the theoretical and empirical effects of free trade. Although it creates winners and losers, the broad consensus among economists is that free trade provides a net gain for society. In a 2006 survey of American economists (83 responders), &quot;87.5% agree that the U.S. should eliminate remaining tariffs and other barriers to trade&quot; and &quot;90.1% disagree with the suggestion that the U.S. should restrict employers from outsourcing work to foreign countries&quot;.

Quoting Harvard economics professor N. Gregory Mankiw, &quot;Few propositions command as much consensus among professional economists as that open world trade increases economic growth and raises living standards&quot;. In a survey of leading economists, none disagreed with the notion that &quot;freer trade improves productive efficiency and offers consumers better choices, and in the long run these gains are much larger than any effects on employment&quot;.

Paul Krugman stated that free trade is greatly beneficial to the world as a whole, and especially beneficial to people in poorer nations, since it allows them to increase their standards of living. He also stated in 2007 that, as the US trades more with less-industrialized countries whose workers are paid less than equivalent US workers (2007 wages in Mexico were 1/10 what they were in the US, and in China less than 1/20), increased trade with those countries will put downward pressure on unskilled labor rates in the US.

=== Public opinions ===

An overwhelming number of people internationally – both in developed and developing countries – support trade with other countries, but are more split when it comes to whether or not they believe trade creates jobs, increases wages, and decreases prices. The median belief in advanced economies is that trade increases wages, with 31 percent of people believing it does, compared to 27 percent who believe it does not. In emerging economies, 47 percent of people believe trade increases wages, compared to 20 percent who says it lowers wages. There is a positive relationship of 0.66 between the average GDP growth rate for the years 2014 to 2017 and the percentage of people in a given country that say trade increases wages. Most people, in both advanced and emerging economies, believe that trade increases prices. 35 percent of people in advanced economies and 56 percent in emerging economies believe trade increases prices, and 29 percent and 18 percent, respectively, believe that trade lowers prices. Those with a higher level of education are more likely than those with less education to believe that trade lowers prices.

== History ==
=== Early era ===
The notion of a free trade system encompassing multiple sovereign states originated in a rudimentary form in 16th century Imperial Spain. American jurist Arthur Nussbaum noted that Spanish theologian Francisco de Vitoria was &quot;the first to set forth the notions (though not the terms) of freedom of commerce and freedom of the seas&quot;. Vitoria made the case under principles of &quot;jus gentium&quot;. However, it was two early British economists Adam Smith and David Ricardo who later developed the idea of free trade into its modern and recognizable form.

Economists who advocated free trade believed trade was the reason why certain civilizations prospered economically. For example, Smith pointed to increased trading as being the reason for the flourishing of not just Mediterranean cultures such as Egypt, Greece and Rome, but also of Bengal (East India) and China. Netherlands prospered greatly after throwing off Spanish Imperial rule and pursuing a policy of free trade. This made the free trade/mercantilist dispute the most important question in economics for centuries. Free trade policies have battled with mercantilist, protectionist, isolationist, socialist, populist and other policies over the centuries.

The Ottoman Empire had liberal free trade policies by the 18th century, with origins in capitulations of the Ottoman Empire, dating back to the first commercial treaties signed with France in 1536 and taken further with capitulations in 1673, in 1740 which lowered duties to only 3% for imports and exports and in 1790. Ottoman free trade policies were praised by British economists advocating free trade such as J. R. McCulloch in his &quot;Dictionary of Commerce&quot; (1834), but criticized by British politicians opposing free trade such as Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, who cited the Ottoman Empire as &quot;an instance of the injury done by unrestrained competition&quot; in the 1846 Corn Laws debate, arguing that it destroyed what had been &quot;some of the finest manufactures of the world&quot; in 1812.
Trade in colonial America was regulated by the British mercantile system through the Acts of Trade and Navigation. Until the 1760s, few colonists openly advocated for free trade, in part because regulations were not strictly enforced (New England was famous for smuggling), but also because colonial merchants did not want to compete with foreign goods and shipping. According to historian Oliver Dickerson, a desire for free trade was not one of the causes of the American Revolution. &quot;The idea that the basic mercantile practices of the eighteenth century were wrong&quot;, wrote Dickerson, &quot;was not a part of the thinking of the Revolutionary leaders&quot;.

Free trade came to what would become the United States as a result of the American Revolution. After the British Parliament issued the Prohibitory Act in 1775, blockading colonial ports, the Continental Congress responded by effectively declaring economic independence, opening American ports to foreign trade on 6 April 1776 – three months before declaring sovereign independence. According to historian John W. Tyler, &quot;[f]ree trade had been forced on the Americans, like it or not&quot;.

In March 1801, the Pope Pius VII ordered some liberalization of trade to face the economic crisis in the Papal States with the &quot;motu proprio&quot; &quot;Le più colte&quot;. Despite this, the export of national corn was forbidden to ensure the food for the Papal States.
In Britain, free trade became a central principle practiced by the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. Large-scale agitation was sponsored by the Anti–Corn Law League. Under the Treaty of Nanking, China opened five treaty ports to world trade in 1843. The first free trade agreement, the Cobden-Chevalier Treaty, was put in place in 1860 between Britain and France which led to successive agreements between other countries in Europe.

Many classical liberals, especially in 19th and early 20th century Britain (e.g. John Stuart Mill) and in the United States for much of the 20th century (e.g. Henry Ford and Secretary of State Cordell Hull), believed that free trade promoted peace. Woodrow Wilson included free-trade rhetoric in his &quot;Fourteen Points&quot; speech of 1918:

According to economic historian Douglas Irwin, a common myth about United States trade policy is that low tariffs harmed American manufacturers in the early 19th century and then that high tariffs made the United States into a great industrial power in the late 19th century. A review by the &quot;Economist&quot; of Irwin&#x27;s 2017 book &quot;Clashing over Commerce: A History of US Trade Policy&quot; notes:

Political dynamics would lead people to see a link between tariffs and the economic cycle that was not there. A boom would generate enough revenue for tariffs to fall, and when the bust came pressure would build to raise them again. By the time that happened, the economy would be recovering, giving the impression that tariff cuts caused the crash and the reverse generated the recovery. Mr Irwin also methodically debunks the idea that protectionism made America a great industrial power, a notion believed by some to offer lessons for developing countries today. As its share of global manufacturing powered from 23% in 1870 to 36% in 1913, the admittedly high tariffs of the time came with a cost, estimated at around 0.5% of GDP in the mid-1870s. In some industries, they might have sped up development by a few years. But American growth during its protectionist period was more to do with its abundant resources and openness to people and ideas.

According to Paul Bairoch, since the end of the 18th century, the United States has been &quot;the homeland and bastion of modern protectionism&quot;. In fact, the United States never adhered to free trade until 1945. For the most part, the Jeffersonians strongly opposed protectionism. In the 19th century, statesmen such as Senator Henry Clay continued Alexander Hamilton&#x27;s themes within the Whig Party under the name American System. The opposition Democratic Party contested several elections throughout the 1830s, 1840s and 1850s in part over the issue of the tariff and protection of industry. The Democratic Party favored moderate tariffs used for government revenue only while the Whigs favored higher protective tariffs to protect favored industries. The economist Henry Charles Carey became a leading proponent of the American System of economics. This mercantilist American System was opposed by the Democratic Party of Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, John Tyler, James K. Polk, Franklin Pierce and James Buchanan.

The fledgling Republican Party led by Abraham Lincoln, who called himself a &quot;Henry Clay tariff Whig&quot;, strongly opposed free trade and implemented a 44% tariff during the Civil War, in part to pay for railroad subsidies and for the war effort and in part to protect favored industries. William McKinley (later to become President of the United States) stated the stance of the Republican Party (which won every election for president from 1868 until 1912, except the two non-consecutive terms of Grover Cleveland) as thus:

During the interwar period, economic protectionism took hold in the United States, most famously in the form of the Smoot–Hawley Tariff Act which is credited by economists with the prolonging and worldwide propagation of the Great Depression. From 1934, trade liberalization began to take place through the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act.

=== Post-World War II ===
Since the end of World War II, in part due to industrial size and the onset of the Cold War, the United States has often been a proponent of reduced tariff-barriers and free trade. The United States helped establish the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and later the World Trade Organization, although it had rejected an earlier version in the 1950s, the International Trade Organization. Since the 1970s, United States governments have negotiated managed-trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement in the 1990s, and the Dominican Republic–Central America Free Trade Agreement in 2006.

In Europe, six countries formed the European Coal and Steel Community in 1951 which became the European Economic Community (EEC) in 1958. Two core objectives of the EEC were the development of a common market, subsequently renamed the single market, and establishing a customs union between its member states. After expanding its membership, the EEC became the European Union in 1993. The European Union, now the world&#x27;s largest single market, has concluded free trade agreements with many countries around the world.

=== Modern era ===


Most countries in the world are members of the World Trade Organization which limits in certain ways but does not eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers. Most countries are also members of regional free trade areas that lower trade barriers among participating countries. The European Union and the United States are negotiating a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. in 2018, the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership came into force, which includes eleven countries that have borders on the Pacific Ocean.

==== Degree of free trade policies ====
Free trade may apply to trade in goods and services. Non-economic considerations may inhibit free trade as a country may espouse free trade in principle but ban certain drugs, such as ethanol, or certain practices, such as prostitution, and limiting international free trade.

Some degree of protectionism is nevertheless the norm throughout the world. From 1820 to 1980, the average tariffs on manufactures in twelve industrial countries ranged from 11 to 32%. In the developing world, average tariffs on manufactured goods are approximately 34%. The American economist C. Fred Bergsten devised the bicycle theory to describe trade policy. According to this model, trade policy is dynamically unstable in that it constantly tends towards either liberalization or protectionism. To prevent falling off the bike (the disadvantages of protectionism), trade policy and multilateral trade negotiations must constantly pedal towards greater liberalization. To achieve greater liberalization, decision makers must appeal to the greater welfare for consumers and the wider national economy over narrower parochial interests. However, Bergsten also posits that it is also necessary to compensate the losers in trade and help them find new work as this will both reduce the backlash against globalization and the motives for trades unions and politicians to call for protection of trade.

In &quot;Kicking Away the Ladder&quot;, development economist Ha-Joon Chang reviews the history of free trade policies and economic growth and notes that many of the now-industrialized countries had significant barriers to trade throughout their history. The United States and Britain, sometimes considered the homes of free trade policy, employed protectionism to varying degrees at all times. Britain abolished the Corn Laws which restricted import of grain in 1846 in response to domestic pressures and reduced protectionism for manufactures only in the mid 19th century when its technological advantage was at its height, but tariffs on manufactured products had returned to 23% by 1950. The United States maintained weighted average tariffs on manufactured products of approximately 40–50% up until the 1950s, augmented by the natural protectionism of high transportation costs in the 19th century. The most consistent practitioners of free trade have been Switzerland, the Netherlands and to a lesser degree Belgium. Chang describes the export-oriented industrialization policies of the Four Asian Tigers as &quot;far more sophisticated and fine-tuned than their historical equivalents&quot;.

===== Free trade in goods =====
The Global Enabling Trade Report measures the factors, policies and services that facilitate the trade in goods across borders and to destinations. The index summarizes four sub-indexes, namely market access; border administration; transport and communications infrastructure; and business environment. As of 2016, the top 30 countries and areas were the following:

== Politics ==

Academics, governments and interest groups debate the relative costs, benefits and beneficiaries of free trade.

Arguments for protectionism fall into the economic category (trade hurts the economy or groups in the economy) or into the moral category (the effects of trade might help the economy but have ill effects in other areas). A general argument against free trade is that it represents neocolonialism in disguise. The moral category is wide, including concerns about:

* destroying infant industries
* undermining long-run economic development
* promoting income inequality
* tolerating environmental degradation
* supporting child labor and sweatshops
* creating a race to the bottom
* accentuating poverty in poor countries
* harming national defense
* forcing cultural change

Economic arguments against free trade criticize the assumptions or conclusions of economic theories. 

Domestic industries often oppose free trade on the grounds that lower prices for imported goods would reduce their profits and market share. For example, if the United States reduced tariffs on imported sugar, sugar producers would receive lower prices and profits, and sugar consumers would spend less for the same amount of sugar because of those same lower prices. The economic theory of David Ricardo holds that consumers would necessarily gain more than producers would lose. Since each of the domestic sugar producers would lose a lot while each of a great number of consumers would gain only a little, domestic producers are more likely to mobilize against the reduction in tariffs. More generally, producers often favor domestic subsidies and tariffs on imports in their home countries while objecting to subsidies and tariffs in their export markets.

Socialists frequently oppose free trade on the ground that it allows maximum exploitation of workers by capital. For example, Karl Marx wrote in &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; (1848): &quot;The bourgeoisie [...] has set up that single, unconscionable freedom – free trade. In one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation&quot;. Marx supported free trade, however, solely because he felt that it would hasten the social revolution. He also viewed the tendency to support protectionism out of spite for free trade to be unsound. That is because Marx viewed protectionism as a means for domestic firms to establish &quot;large-scale&quot; industry within its borders, which would inevitably make it dependent on the world market so that it could make more revenue for example. He also argues that protectionism does not stop a country from developing a domestic economic system that ironically mirrors competitive free trade. 

Many anti-globalization groups oppose free trade based on their assertion that free-trade agreements generally do not increase the economic freedom of the poor or of the working class and frequently make them poorer.

Some opponents of free trade favor free-trade theory but oppose free-trade agreements as applied. Some opponents of NAFTA see the agreement as materially harming the common people, but some of the arguments are actually against the particulars of government-managed trade, rather than against free trade &quot;per se&quot;. For example, it is argued that it would be wrong to let subsidized corn from the United States into Mexico freely under NAFTA at prices well below production cost (dumping) because of its ruinous effects to Mexican farmers.

Research shows that support for trade restrictions is highest among respondents with the lowest levels of education. Hainmueller and Hiscox find:

that the impact of education on how voters think about trade and globalization has more to do with exposure to economic ideas and information about the aggregate and varied effects of these economic phenomena, than it does with individual calculations about how trade affects personal income or job security. This is not to say that the latter types of calculations are not important in shaping individuals&#x27; views of trade – just that they are not being manifest in the simple association between education and support for trade openness A 2017 study found that individuals whose occupations are routine-task-intensive and who do jobs that are offshorable are more likely to favor protectionism.

Research suggests that attitudes towards free trade do not necessarily reflect individuals&#x27; self-interests.

=== Colonialism ===

Various proponents of economic nationalism and of the school of mercantilism have long portrayed free trade as a form of colonialism or imperialism. In the 19th century, such groups criticized British calls for free trade as cover for British Empire, notably in the works of American Henry Clay, architect of the American System.

Free-trade debates and associated matters involving the colonial administration of Ireland
have periodically (such as in 1846 and 1906) caused ructions in the British Conservative (Tory) Party (Corn Law issues in the 1820s to the 1840s, Irish Home Rule issues throughout the 19th and early-20th centuries).

Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa (in office from 2007 to 2017) denounced the &quot;sophistry of free trade&quot; in an introduction he wrote for a 2006 book, &quot;The Hidden Face of Free Trade Accords&quot;, which was written in part by Correa&#x27;s Energy Minister Alberto Acosta. Citing as his source the 2002 book &quot;Kicking Away the Ladder&quot; written by Ha-Joon Chang, Correa identified the difference between an &quot;American system&quot; opposed to a &quot;British System&quot; of free trade. The Americans explicitly viewed the latter, he says, as &quot;part of the British imperialist system&quot;. According to Correa, Chang showed that Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton (in office 1789–1795), rather than List, first presented a systematic argument defending industrial protectionism.

== Major free trade areas ==
=== Africa ===
=== Europe ===
=== Americas ===
== Alternatives ==

The following alternatives to free trade have been proposed: protectionism, imperialism, balanced trade, fair trade, and industrial policy.

Under balanced trade, nations are required to provide a fairly even reciprocal trade pattern; they cannot run large trade deficits or trade surpluses. Fair trade involves allowing trade but taking into account other interests, such as dirigisme, protecting labor rights, environmentalism, etc.

=== Protectionism ===
Protectionism involves tariffs to protect domestic goods and industry from international competition, and to raise government revenue in lieu of other forms of taxation.

In 1846, the United Kingdom abolished the Corn Laws (which had restricted import of grain), in response to the famine in Ireland and other domestic pressures over food prices. It also reduced protectionism for manufactures, but only in the mid 19th century when its technological advantage was at its height. Tariffs on manufactured products had returned to 23% by 1950. 

The United States maintained weighted average tariffs on manufactured products of approximately 40–50% up until the 1950s, augmented by the natural protectionism of high transportation costs in the 19th century. The 2016 presidential election marked the beginning of the trend of returning to protectionism in the United States, an ideology incorporated into Republican president Donald Trump&#x27;s platform and largely maintained by his successor Joe Biden.

=== Imperialism ===
Imperialism entails unequal exchange for the benefit of the mother country, often at the expense of the colonies. The imperial trade practices of the British and Spanish Empires were contributing factors to the American Revolution and the Spanish American Wars of Independence.

Belgium also engaged in unequal exchange, most notoriously in the Congo Free State (CFS) under King Leopold II. In direct violation of his promises of free trade within the CFS under the terms of the Berlin Treaty, not only did the CFS become a commercial entity directly or indirectly trading within its dominion, but Leopold had also been slowly monopolizing a considerable amount of the ivory and rubber trade by imposing export duties on the resources traded by other merchants within the CFS.

== In literature ==
The value of free trade was first observed and documented in 1776 by Adam Smith in &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;, writing:

This statement uses the concept of absolute advantage to present an argument in opposition to mercantilism, the dominant view surrounding trade at the time which held that a country should aim to export more than it imports and thus amass wealth. Instead, Smith argues, countries could gain from each producing exclusively the goods in which they are most suited to, trading between each other as required for the purposes of consumption. In this vein, it is not the value of exports relative to that of imports that is important, but the value of the goods produced by a nation. However, the concept of absolute advantage does not address a situation where a country has no advantage in the production of a particular good or type of good.

This theoretical shortcoming was addressed by the theory of comparative advantage. Generally attributed to David Ricardo, who expanded on it in his 1817 book &quot;On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation&quot;, it makes a case for free trade based not on absolute advantage in production of a good, but on the relative opportunity costs of production. A country should specialize in whatever good it can produce at the lowest cost, trading this good to buy other goods it requires for consumption. This allows for countries to benefit from trade even when they do not have an absolute advantage in any area of production. While their gains from trade might not be equal to those of a country more productive in all goods, they will still be better off economically from trade than they would be under a state of autarky.

Exceptionally, Henry George&#x27;s 1886 book &quot;Protection or Free Trade&quot; was read out loud in full into the Congressional Record by five Democratic congressmen. American economist Tyler Cowen wrote that &quot;Protection or Free Trade&quot; &quot;remains perhaps the best-argued tract on free trade to this day&quot;.&quot; Although George is very critical towards protectionism, he discusses the subject in particular with respect to the interests of labor:

We all hear with interest and pleasure of improvements in transportation by water or land; we are all disposed to regard the opening of canals, the building of railways, the deepening of harbors, the improvement of steamships as beneficial. But if such things are beneficial, how can tariffs be beneficial? The effect of such things is to lessen the cost of transporting commodities; the effect of tariffs is to increase it. If the protective theory be true, every improvement that cheapens the carriage of goods between country and country is an injury to mankind unless tariffs be commensurately increased.

George considers the general free trade argument inadequate. He argues that the removal of protective tariffs alone is never sufficient to improve the situation of the working class, unless accompanied by a shift towards a &quot;single tax&quot; in the form of a land value tax.

<text>Sophia Baddeley born Sophia Snow (1745 – July 1786) was an English actress, singer and courtesan.

== Early life, musical career ==
She was born in London, the daughter of Mary and Valentine Snow, who was the sergeant-trumpeter to George II. As a child, she was trained by her father for a future musical career. 

At the age of eighteen she eloped with the actor Robert Baddeley, then on the stage at Drury Lane. She made her first appearance on 27 April 1765, as Ophelia in &quot;Hamlet.&quot; She also played Cordelia in &quot;King Lear&quot;, Imogen in &quot;Cymbeline&quot; and later Olivia in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. In 1769, she joined David Garrick&#x27;s theatre company when he staged the Stratford Jubilee. In that year she appeared in a Royal Command Performance of The Clandestine Marriage on 12 October. She appeared as Fanny Sterling with Robert as Canton and Thomas King as Lord Ogleby. These three were painted in that role by Johan Zoffany and the painting is now owned by the Garrick Club.

Baddeley was noted as a talented singer rather than as an actress, she obtained engagements at Ranelagh and Vauxhall Gardens to public acclaim.

== Life as a courtesan ==
At the height of her success and after separating from her husband in 1770, she discovered that she could sustain herself financially by finding wealthy benefactors and establishing herself as a courtesan to them. Probably her best-known lover was Peniston Lamb, 1st Viscount Melbourne. She was famous for her beauty, and was also noted for her extravagant lifestyle. Her overspending and ultimate failure in managing her finances eventually obliged her to take refuge from her creditors in Dublin, Ireland and later Edinburgh, Scotland. Her benefactors gone, and her own health in decline, she made her last appearance on the stage in Edinburgh in 1785. 

She died of consumption, aged 41, the following year at her lodging at Shakespeare Square in Edinburgh at the east end of Princes Street.

<doc id="59214" wikidata="Q182290" url="?curid=59214" title="Customs">
<text>Customs is an authority or agency in a country responsible for collecting tariffs and for controlling the flow of goods, including animals, transports, personal effects, and hazardous items, into and out of a country. Traditionally, customs has been considered as the fiscal subject that charges customs duties (i.e. tariffs) and other taxes on import and export. In recent decades, the views on the functions of customs have considerably expanded and now covers three basic issues: taxation, security, and trade facilitation.

Each country has its own laws and regulations for the import and export of goods into and out of a country, enforced by their respective customs authorities; the import/export of some goods may be restricted or forbidden entirely. A wide range of penalties are faced by those who break these laws.

== Overview ==
=== Taxation ===
The traditional function of customs has been the assessment and collection of customs duties, which is a tariff or tax on the importation or, at times, exportation of goods. Commercial goods not yet cleared through customs are held in a customs area, often called a bonded store, until processed. Authorized ports are usually recognized customs areas.

===Trade facilitation===
A more recent objective of customs has been trade facilitation, which is the streamlining of processing of import and export of goods to reduce trade transaction costs. The contemporary understanding of the “trade facilitation” concept is based on the Recommendation No. 4 of UN/CEFACT “National Trade Facilitation Bodies”. According to its provisions (para. 14),

facilitation covers formalities, procedures, documents and operations related to international trade transactions. Its goals are simplification, harmonization and standardization, so that transactions become easier, faster and more economical than before.

=== Security ===

The September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States has become the cardinal factor in prompting a significant strengthening of the security component of modern customs operations, after which security-oriented control measures for supply chains have been widely implemented for the aims of preventing risk identification. At airports today, customs functions as the point of no return for all passengers; once passengers have cleared customs, they cannot go back. Anyone arriving at an airport must also clear customs before they can officially enter a country. Those who breach the law will be detained by customs and likely returned to their original location. The movement of people into and out of a country is normally monitored by migration authorities, under a variety of names and arrangements. Border control authorities normally check for appropriate documentation, verify that a person is entitled to enter the country, apprehend people wanted by domestic or international arrest warrants, and deny the entry of people deemed dangerous to the country.

The most complete guidelines for customs security functions implementation is provided in the World Customs Organization Framework of Standards to Secure and Facilitate Global Trade (SAFE), which has had five editions in 2005, 2007, 2010, 2012, and 2018, respectively.

==Privatization of customs==

Customs is part of one of the three basic functions of a government, namely: administration; maintenance of law, order, and justice; and collection of revenue. However, in a bid to mitigate corruption, many countries have partly privatised their customs. This has occurred by way of contracting pre-shipment inspection agencies, which examine the cargo and verify the declared value before importation occurs. The country&#x27;s customs is obliged to accept the agency&#x27;s report for the purpose of assessing duties and taxes at the port of entry.

While engaging a pre-shipment inspection agency may appear justified in a country with an inexperienced or inadequate customs establishment, the measure has not been able to plug the loophole and protect revenue. It has been found that evasion of customs duty escalated when pre-shipment agencies took over. It has also been alleged that involvement of such agencies has caused shipping delays. Privatization of customs has been viewed as a fatal remedy. In many countries, import and export data are issued on the basis of national laws (Transparency Laws / &quot;Freedom of Information Act&quot;).

There has, however, been some speed bumps when transitioning customs over from the public to private sector. Factors such as an incompetent private sector, government&#x27;s reluctance to change the traditional roles of customs, neglecting priority-setting and lack of transparency in the transition process have slowed the rate at which the public to private transition has taken place.

== Red and green channels ==
In most countries, customs procedures for arriving passengers at major international airports, ports and some road crossings are separated into red and green channels. Passengers with goods to declare (carrying goods above the permitted customs limits and/or carrying prohibited items) go through the red channel, while passengers with nothing to declare (carrying goods within the permitted customs limits and not carrying prohibited items) go through the green channel. However, entry into a particular channel constitutes a legal declaration, so if a passenger goes through a green channel and is found to be in possession of a prohibited item, or failure to declare dutiable items the passenger can be subject to a fine, the item being seized, and in some cases result in an arrest and criminal prosecution. Each channel is a point of no return, once a passenger has entered a particular channel, they cannot go back.

Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States do not officially operate a red and green channel system; however, some airports have adopted this layout.

===Blue channel===
Airports in EU countries also have a blue channel. As the EU is a customs union, travellers between EU countries do not have to pay customs duties. Value-added tax (VAT) and excise duties may be applicable if the goods are subsequently sold, but these are collected when the goods are sold, not at the border. Passengers arriving from other EU countries go through the blue channel, where they may still be subject to checks for prohibited or restricted goods. Luggage tickets for checked luggage travelling within the EU are green-edged so they may be identified. In the recent years usage of the blue channel has become limited mostly to flights between the Schengen Area member states of the EU and the remainder of EU member states, while flights which cross the border of neither the customs union nor the Schengen Area are in practice treated as domestic, and therefore, the people travelling on them do not go through customs channels at all.

===Red point phone===
All airports in the United Kingdom operate a channel system; however, some airports do not have a red channel, instead having a red point phone which serves the same purpose.

==Summary of basic custom rules==
===Europe===
The basic customs law is harmonized across Europe within the European Union Customs Union. This includes customs duties and restrictions. Customs tax typically applies from €22 to €150. For more information, see regulations of each member state.

For customs declarations in the EU and in Switzerland, Norway and Iceland, the &quot;Single Administrative Document&quot; (SAD) is used as a basis.

====Germany====

Up to €22, there are no taxes. From €22 up to €150, it is necessary to pay VAT (EUSt in Germany), which is 7% or 19% depending on the goods. From €150 it is necessary to pay VAT and customs.

====Romania====

Customs may be very strict, especially for goods shipped from anywhere outside the EU. Up to €10 goods/package.

====Italy====

Customs in Italy takes additional 22% VAT (Value-added tax) for goods imported from outside the European Union even if the VAT is already paid to the origin country sender.

====Czech Republic and Slovakia====
Up to €22, there are no taxes. From €22 up to €150, it is necessary to pay VAT (DPH in Czech/Slovak), which is 21%. From €150, it is necessary to pay VAT and customs. Customs may range from zero to 10% depending on the type of imported goods.

==== Ukraine ====
Ukraine has had 5 reforms of its customs authorities. The recent one, in 2019, reorganized State Fiscal Service into the State Customs Service. The reform attempt seeks to digitize customs procedures, get market-level wages, innovate customs checkpoints, integrate into EU customs community, open reference database of customs inspections.

===The Americas===
====Canada====

In 2003, Canada replaced the Canada Customs and Revenue Agency with the current Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). The CBSA performs searches at Canadian ports of entry and detains illegal immigrants, along with preventing contraband from entering the country. Tariffs are administered under Canada&#x27;s &quot;Customs Tariff Act&quot;.

====United States====
Every person arriving in the US is subject to inspection by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officers for compliance with immigration, customs and agriculture regulations. This public service is administered on almost a million visitors who enter the US daily. Travelers are screened for a number of prohibited items including; gold, alcoholic beverages, firearms and soil. A wide range of penalties face those non-compliers.

The United States imposes tariffs or &quot;customs duties&quot; on imports of goods, being 3% on average. The duty is levied at the time of import and is paid by the importer of record. Individuals arriving in the United States may be exempt from duty on a limited amount of purchases, and on goods temporarily imported (such as laptop computers) under the ATA Carnet system. Customs duties vary by country of origin and product, with duties ranging from zero to 81% of the value of the goods. Goods from many countries are exempt from duty under various trade agreements. Certain types of goods are exempt from duty regardless of source. Customs rules differ from other import restrictions. Failure to comply with customs rules can result in seizure of goods and civil and criminal penalties against involved parties. The CBP enforces customs rules. All goods entering the United States are subject to inspection by CBP prior to legal entry.

====Uruguay====
Uruguayan Customs place a cap on the importation of personal packages to up to 3 packages of a nominal value of no more than US$200 which can be entered into the country without extra charge. For a package to be included in the 3 free slots, the addressee must register the package with the Uruguayan Postal Service linking the tracking code, their address, national ID number phone and email address. Should a package arrive prior to registration the package must pay the 60% tax and no less than US$10. Any personal package worth more than US$200 or after the 3 free packages, must pay a 60% tax. This severely limits the public&#x27;s ability to buy products online. Due to Uruguay&#x27;s small population and market, many popular and specialty products are unavailable in the regular marketplace, forcing Uruguayans to strategically pool several purchases together and max each one of their free slots.

====Argentina====
Customs may be very strict. Goods valued up to US$500 brought in by plane and up to US$300 by sea or land are free of duties and taxes, cellphones and laptop computers are duty free regardless of their value only one per passenger, clothing and other personal use items are free of taxes. Above those values, tax is 50% of the value of all acquired goods summed up.

=== Asia ===

==== Indonesia ====
Main article: Directorate General of Customs and Excise

&quot;Direktorat Jenderal Bea dan Cukai&quot; (abbreviated &quot;Bea Cukai&quot; or DJBC), works under the Ministry of Finance (Indonesia) and performs various duties relating to the traffic of goods entering or leaving the Customs Area such as the collection of import/export duties, monitoring prohibition and restriction of certain goods, collecting excise and other state levies based on legislation apply.

* to facilitate trade and industry;
* to protect the border and the community from smuggling and illegal trade; and
* to optimize state revenue in the field of customs and excise 

== International Customs Day ==

<text>Liza May Minnelli ( ; born March 12, 1946) is an American actress, singer, and dancer. Known for her commanding stage presence and powerful alto singing voice, Minnelli has received numerous accolades including an Academy Award, a BAFTA Award, an Emmy Award, two Golden Globe Awards, and four Tony Awards. She is one of the few performers awarded a non-competitive EGOT having received two honorary Grammy Awards. Minnelli is a Knight of the French Legion of Honour. Her persona and her style have cemented her as a gay icon.

Minnelli&#x27;s parents were actress and singer Judy Garland and director Vincente Minnelli. After moving to New York City in 1961, she began her career as a musical theatre actress, nightclub performer, and traditional pop artist. She made her professional stage debut in the Off-Broadway revival of &quot;Best Foot Forward&quot; (1963). She became known for collaboration with John Kander and Fred Ebb, and later won the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical for her roles in the Broadway musicals &quot;Flora the Red Menace&quot; (1965) and &quot;The Act&quot; (1978). She was Tony-nominated for &quot;The Rink&quot; (1984). She won Special Tony Awards for &quot;Liza at the Winter Garden&quot; (1974) and &quot;Liza at the Palace!&quot; (2009). 

On film, she had her breakthrough performance in the drama film &quot;The Sterile Cuckoo&quot; (1969), earning her a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress. She later received the award playing Sally Bowles in the musical film &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1972), which brought her to international prominence. She starred in a string of films such as &quot;Lucky Lady&quot; (1975), &quot;New York, New York&quot; (1977), &quot;Arthur&quot; (1981), &quot;Rent-a-Cop&quot; (1988), and &quot;Stepping Out&quot; (1991). On television, she had a career resurgence as a recurring guest star on the sitcom &quot;Arrested Development&quot; (2003–2013). 

Her concert performances at Carnegie Hall in 1979 and 1987 and at Radio City Music Hall in 1991 and 1992 are recognized among her most successful. From 1988 to 1990, she toured with Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. in &quot;Frank, Liza &amp; Sammy: The Ultimate Event&quot;. Minnelli is known for her renditions of American standards and is known for her signature songs which include (&quot;New York, New York&quot;, &quot;Cabaret&quot;, and &quot;Maybe This Time&quot;). Throughout her later years she has suffered serious health problems, she has avoided huge concert performances in favor of small retrospective performances. Her life was profiled in the 2024 documentary, &quot;&quot;.

==Early life==
Minnelli was born on March 12, 1946, at the Cedars of Lebanon hospital in Hollywood. She is the daughter of Judy Garland and Vincente Minnelli. Her parents named her after Ira Gershwin&#x27;s song &quot;Liza (All the Clouds&#x27;ll Roll Away)&quot;. Minnelli has a half-sister, Lorna, and half-brother, Joey, from Garland&#x27;s marriage to Sid Luft. She has another half-sister, Christiane Nina Minnelli (nicknamed Tina Nina), from her father&#x27;s second marriage. Minnelli&#x27;s godparents were Kay Thompson and Ira Gershwin.

Minnelli&#x27;s first performing experience on film was at age three appearing in the final scene of the musical &quot;In the Good Old Summertime&quot; (1949); the film stars Garland and Van Johnson. In 1961 she moved to New York City, attending High School of Performing Arts and later, Chadwick School.

==Career==
===Theatre===
During 1961, Minnelli was an apprentice at the Cape Cod Melody Tent in Hyannis, Massachusetts. She appeared in the chorus of &quot;Flower Drum Song&quot; and played the part of Muriel in &quot;Take Me Along&quot;. She began performing professionally at the age of 17 in 1963 in an Off-Broadway revival of the musical &quot;Best Foot Forward&quot;, for which she received the Theatre World Award, and also toured in &quot;The Fantasticks&quot;, opposite Elliott Gould.

The next year, her mother invited her to perform with her in concert at the London Palladium. Both concerts were recorded and released as an album. Minnelli attended Scarsdale High School for one year, starring in a production of &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot; that then went to Israel on tour. She turned to Broadway at 19, and won her first Tony Award as a leading actress for &quot;Flora the Red Menace&quot;. It was the first time that she worked with the musical pair John Kander and Fred Ebb.

===Music===
Minnelli began as a nightclub singer as an adolescent, making her professional nightclub debut at the age of 19 at the Shoreham Hotel in Washington, D.C. That same year she began appearing in other clubs and on stage in Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, and New York City. Her success as a live performer led her to record several albums for Capitol Records: &quot;Liza! Liza!&quot; (1964), &quot;It Amazes Me&quot; (1965), and &quot;There Is a Time&quot; (1966). In her early years, she recorded traditional pop standards as well as show tunes from various musicals in which she starred. Because of this fact, William Ruhlmann named her &quot;Barbra Streisand&#x27;s little sister&quot;. The Capitol albums &quot;Liza! Liza!&quot;, &quot;It Amazes Me&quot;, and &quot;There Is a Time&quot; were reissued on the two-CD compilation &quot;The Capitol Years&quot; in 2001, in their entirety.

From 1968 to the 1970s, Minnelli also recorded her albums &quot;Liza Minnelli&quot; (1968), &quot;Come Saturday Morning&quot; and &quot;New Feelin&#x27;&quot; (both 1970) for A&amp;M Records. In 1973, Minnelli sang back up with Ronnie Spector for Alice Cooper&#x27;s song &quot;Teenage Lament &#x27;74&quot; from the album &quot;Muscle of Love&quot; (1973). She released her solo albums &quot;The Singer&quot; (1973) and &quot;Tropical Nights&quot; (1977) on Columbia Records.

In 1989, Minnelli collaborated with the Pet Shop Boys on &quot;Results&quot;, an electronic dance-style album. The release hit the top 10 in the UK and charted in the U.S., spawning four singles: &quot;Losing My Mind&quot;; &quot;Don&#x27;t Drop Bombs&quot;; &quot;So Sorry, I Said&quot;; and &quot;Love Pains&quot;. Later that year, she performed &quot;Losing My Mind&quot; live at the Grammys Award ceremony before receiving a Grammy Legend Award (the first Grammy Legend Awards were issued in 1990 to Minnelli, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Smokey Robinson, and Willie Nelson). With this award, she became one of only 16 people—a list that includes composer Richard Rodgers, Whoopi Goldberg, Barbra Streisand, and John Gielgud and others—to win an Emmy, Grammy, Tony Award and Academy Award.

In April 1992, Minnelli appeared at the tribute concert for her late friend Freddie Mercury, performing &quot;We Are the Champions&quot; with the surviving members of the rock band Queen at Wembley Stadium in London. In 1996, Minnelli released a studio album titled &quot;Gently&quot;. It was a recording of jazz standards and included contemporary songs such as the cover of &quot;Does He Love You&quot; which she performed as a duet with Donna Summer. This album brought her a Grammy nomination for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Performance.

In 2006, Minnelli appeared on My Chemical Romance&#x27;s album &quot;The Black Parade&quot;, providing backing vocals and singing a solo part with Gerard Way on the track &quot;Mama&quot;. Minnelli was nominated in 2009 for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album for her studio recording &quot;Liza&#x27;s at the Palace...!&quot;, based on her hit Broadway show. Minnelli released an album on the Decca Records label titled &quot;Confessions&quot; on September 21, 2010.

===Film===

Minnelli&#x27;s first appearance on film is as the baby in the final shot of her mother&#x27;s film &quot;In the Good Old Summertime&quot; (1949). Her first credited film role was as the love interest in &quot;Charlie Bubbles&quot; (1967), Albert Finney&#x27;s only film as director and star, although four years earlier, she did voiceover work for the animated film &quot;Journey Back to Oz&quot;, a sequel to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Minnelli was the voice of Dorothy (a character played in the earlier film by her mother Judy Garland) in what would have been her first credited film role had it been released in 1964 as planned—the Filmation production was delayed, eventually being released in the UK during 1972.

Minnelli appeared in &quot;The Sterile Cuckoo&quot; (1969), Alan J. Pakula&#x27;s first feature film as Director, as Pookie Adams, a needy, eccentric teenager. Her performance was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. She played another eccentric character in &quot;Tell Me That You Love Me, Junie Moon&quot; (1970), directed by Otto Preminger. A nude scene in that film, filmed in a Massachusetts cemetery, resulted in a misdemeanor complaint by family of those buried there, and a &quot;Liza Minnelli Bill&quot; was introduced the following year to penalise filming in Massachusetts cemeteries without permission.

Minnelli appeared in her best-known film role, Sally Bowles, in the film version of &quot;Cabaret&quot; (1972). She said that one of the things she did to prepare was to study photographs of actresses Louise Glaum and Louise Brooks and the dark-haired women of the era in which the film is set. Minnelli won the Academy Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role for her performance, along with a Golden Globe Award, BAFTA Award, and also Sant Jordi Award and David di Donatello Award for Best Foreign Actress.

Following the success of &quot;Cabaret&quot;, Bob Fosse and Minnelli teamed for &quot;Liza with a &#x27;Z&#x27;. A Concert for Television&quot;, a television special. The program aired two times on TV and was not seen again until a DVD release in 2006.

Minnelli appeared in three expensive flops in three years, with &quot;Variety&quot; suggesting by 1978 that she was the number-one choice for box office poison. First was &quot;Lucky Lady&quot; (1975), then she worked with her father in &quot;A Matter of Time&quot; (1976), co-starring Ingrid Bergman and then &quot;New York, New York&quot; (1977), which gave Minnelli her best known signature song. She sometimes performed duets on stage with Frank Sinatra, who recorded a cover version (for his &quot;&quot; album).

Minnelli made fewer film appearances from then on, but her next film, &quot;Arthur&quot; (1981), where she starred as Dudley Moore&#x27;s love interest, was a big hit. She returned to film for &quot;Rent-A-Cop&quot; and &quot;Arthur 2: On the Rocks&quot; (both 1988) and &quot;Stepping Out&quot; (1991), a musical comedy drama. She later appeared in &quot;The Oh in Ohio&quot; in 2006 which received only a limited release in theatres.

===Television===

During the 1950s, Minnelli appeared as a child guest on Art Linkletter&#x27;s show and sang and danced with Gene Kelly on his first television special in 1959. She was a guest star in one episode of &quot;Ben Casey&quot; and was a frequent guest on chat shows of the day, including making numerous appearances on shows hosted by Jack Paar, Merv Griffin, Mike Douglas, Joe Franklin, Dinah Shore and Johnny Carson. During the 1960s, she made several guest appearances on &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot; as well as other variety shows such as &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;The Hollywood Palace&quot;, and &quot;The Judy Garland Show&quot;.

In 1964, Minnelli appeared as Minnie in her first television dramatic role in the episode &quot;Nightingale for Sale&quot; on Craig Stevens&#x27;s short-lived series &quot;Mr. Broadway&quot;. In 1965, she starred in the television special, &quot;The Dangerous Christmas of Red Riding Hood&quot;. A soundtrack was released to coincide with the specials. In 1970, she headlined her first television special, entitled &quot;Liza,&quot; with guest stars Anthony Newley, and Randy Newman. In 1972, she starred in the Bob Fosse directed &quot;Liza with a Z.&quot;

In 1980, she made two television specials, &quot;Goldie and Liza Together,&quot; with Goldie Hawn, and &quot;An Evening with Liza Minnelli.&quot; In 1984, she made a guest appearance as Princess Alecia in &#x27;The Princess and the Pea&#x27; episode of Faerie Tale Theatre. In 1985, she starred in a made-for-TV movie, &quot;A Time to Live,&quot; and in 1988, she appeared in &quot;Sam Found Out: A Triple Play.&quot;

In December 1992, American Public Television aired &quot;Liza Minnelli Live from Radio City Music Hall&quot; produced by Phil Ramone and Chris Giordano. The show received six Emmy nominations and won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Music and Lyrics, awarded to Fred Ebb and John Kander. This was followed by appearances in two more made-for-TV movies: &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;, and &quot;The West Side Waltz&quot;, in 1994 and 1995, respectively.

Much later in her career, Minnelli made guest appearances on shows such as &quot;Arrested Development&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;, &quot;Drop Dead Diva,&quot; and &quot;Smash&quot;. In the UK, she appeared on the Ruby Wax, Graham Norton and Jonathan Ross shows, and in October 2006, participated in a comedy skit on Charlotte Church&#x27;s show and was featured on Michael Parkinson&#x27;s show.

In November 2009, American Public Television aired &quot;Liza&#x27;s at the Palace&quot;, taped from September 30 to October 1, 2009, in Las Vegas at the MGM Grand&#x27;s Hollywood Theatre. The executive producers of the taping, Craig Zadan and Neil Meron, were previously involved with the 2005 rerelease of 1972&#x27;s Emmy- and Peabody Award-winning &quot;Liza with a Z&quot;.

===Later career===
Minnelli returned to Broadway in 1997, taking over the title role in the musical &quot;Victor/Victoria&quot;, replacing Julie Andrews. In his review, &quot;New York Times&quot; critic Ben Brantley wrote &quot;her every stage appearance is perceived as a victory of show-business stamina over psychic frailty. She asks for love so nakedly and earnestly, it seems downright vicious not to respond.&quot;

After a serious case of viral encephalitis in 2000, doctors predicted that Minnelli would spend the rest of her life in a wheelchair and perhaps not be able to speak again. However, taking vocal and dance lessons daily (especially with Sam Harris, Luigi Faccuito, Ron Lewis, and Angela Bacari), she managed to recover. She appeared on a September 19, 2001, episode of &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show,&quot; notable because it was Rosie&#x27;s first show back following the September 11 attacks. Despite having had vocal surgery shortly before, she sang her signature song, &quot;New York, New York&quot;, and received an enthusiastic ovation. She also returned to the stage in 2001 when asked by long-time friend Michael Jackson to perform at Madison Square Garden in New York City where she sang &quot;Never Never Land&quot; and the televised &quot;You Are Not Alone&quot; at the Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special concert produced by future husband David Gest. Minnelli told reporters: &quot;I am stable as a table.&quot;

Gest was so impressed with Minnelli&#x27;s stamina and ability to stun audiences that he produced her in &quot;Liza&#x27;s Back&quot; in Spring 2002, performing to rave reviews in London and New York City. The tour featured a tribute to her mother: after years of declining fans&#x27; pleas for her to sing Garland&#x27;s signature song &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot;, she concluded Act 1 with the final refrain of her mother&#x27;s anthem to an instant ovation.

From 2003 through 2005, she appeared as a recurring character on the Emmy Award-winning TV sitcom &quot;Arrested Development&quot; as Lucille Austero (also known as &quot;Lucille 2&quot;), the lover of both the sexually and socially awkward Buster Bluth and Buster&#x27;s brother Gob. Minnelli appeared in the role for the show&#x27;s fourth season in 2013.

On December 14, 2004, Minnelli made her first appearance in the UK after a long absence, performing as a special guest at the annual Royal Variety Performance. The performance was presented by the BBC, and was attended by Charles, Prince of Wales. It was staged at the London Coliseum, celebrating both its centenary year and the theatre&#x27;s re-opening after an extensive four-year restoration.

In 2005, Minnelli made her first film appearance in more than 15 years, in &quot;The Oh in Ohio&quot;.

In September 2006, Minnelli made a guest appearance on the long-running drama &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; in &quot;Masquerade&quot;, a Halloween-themed episode, broadcast on October 31, 2006.

Minnelli also completed guest vocals on My Chemical Romance&#x27;s 2006 concept album &quot;The Black Parade,&quot; portraying &quot;Mother War&quot;, a dark conception of the main character&#x27;s mother in the song &quot;Mama&quot;.
In 2007, it was announced that Minnelli was working on an album in tribute to Kay Thompson. This turned into Minnelli&#x27;s return to Broadway in a new solo concert at the Palace Theatre titled &quot;Liza&#x27;s at The Palace...!&quot;, which ran from December 3, 2008, through January 4, 2009. In her second act, she performed a series of numbers created by Thompson.

Minnelli was a character in the Australian musical &quot;The Boy from Oz&quot; (a biography of her first husband, Peter Allen) starring Hugh Jackman. In the show&#x27;s Broadway production, she was portrayed by Stephanie J. Block. In October 2009, Minnelli toured Australia and appeared on &quot;Australian Idol&quot; as a mentor and guest judge. Minnelli made a cameo appearance in the May 2010 release of &quot;Sex and the City 2&quot;, in which she covered Beyoncé&#x27;s hit &quot;Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)&quot; and Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;Ev&#x27;ry Time We Say Goodbye&quot;. She made a starring appearance in December 2010 in &quot;The Apprentice&quot;.

Also in 2010, Minnelli released an album of a number of American standards &quot;unplugged&quot; with long-time collaborator Billy Stritch, showing a sultrier and softer, more interpretive side to her artistry. The songs are said to have been recorded several years prior and later released as the album &quot;Confessions&quot;.

On June 14, 2012, Minnelli headlined at Hampton Court Palace Festival. On May 9, 2014, Minnelli had a guest appearance on Cher&#x27;s Dressed to Kill Tour in Brooklyn, performing &quot;Girls Just Want to Have Fun&quot; with Cyndi Lauper and Rosie O&#x27;Donnell.

In 2024, Minnelli announced her plans to release a memoir, to be published in 2026.

==Personal life==
Minnelli has long suffered from alcoholism and has been addicted to prescription drugs, originating from a Valium prescription after her mother died. Her use of recreational drugs in the 1970s was noted by Andy Warhol, who in a 1978 diary entry recalled Minnelli arriving at Halston&#x27;s house and imploring the host to &quot;Give me every drug you&#x27;ve got.&quot; Along with Warhol and Bianca Jagger, Minnelli made frequent appearances at New York City nightclubs during the late 1970s, including Studio 54. Minnelli left her 1984 musical &quot;The Rink&quot; to enter the Betty Ford Clinic.

Minnelli is an Episcopalian.

Minnelli&#x27;s friendships have included the singer Adam Ant, whom she advised on what to wear when he was presented to Queen Elizabeth II after the 1981 Royal Variety Performance at which his band Adam and the Ants performed. Ant in turn namechecked Minnelli in the track &quot;Crackpot History and the Right To Lie&quot; on his 1982 solo album &quot;Friend or Foe&quot;.

During an Australian visit in 1964, Minnelli and her then-boyfriend Peter Allen were invited to the opening of the Compass Centre in Bankstown, Sydney. They were awarded the titles of King and Queen of the Compass Centre.

===Marriages and relationships===
Minnelli has married and divorced four times. Her first marriage was to entertainer Peter Allen on March 3, 1967. Australian-born Allen was Judy Garland&#x27;s protégé in the mid-1960s. Minnelli and Allen agreed to a trial separation on April 9, 1970. Their divorce was finalized on July 24, 1974. Minnelli told &quot;The Advocate&quot; editor-in-chief Judy Wieder in September 1996, &quot;I married Peter, and he didn&#x27;t tell me he was gay. Everyone knew but me. And I found out ... well, let me put it this way: I&#x27;ll never surprise anybody coming home as long as I live. I call first!&quot;

After her separation from Allen, Minnelli was engaged to actor Desi Arnaz Jr and comedian Peter Sellers.

Minnelli married Jack Haley Jr., a producer and director, on September 15, 1974. His father, Jack Haley, was Minnelli&#x27;s mother&#x27;s co-star in &quot;The Wizard of Oz.&quot; They divorced in April 1979.

Minnelli was married to Mark Gero, a sculptor and stage manager, from December 4, 1979, until their divorce in January 1992.

Minnelli was married to David Gest, a concert promoter, from March 16, 2002, until their separation in July 2003 and divorce in April 2007. The wedding boasted over 1200 guests at the Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan, with Michael Jackson as the best man, Elizabeth Taylor as the matron of honor, and a bridal party that included Mia Farrow, Gina Lollobrigida, Petula Clark, Mya, and Janet Leigh among others. Gest was reportedly gay, as was her first husband. In a 2003 lawsuit, Gest alleged that Minnelli beat him in alcohol-induced rages during their marriage. Minnelli denied the accusations, claiming Gest was simply after her money. The suit was dismissed in September 2006 for lack of triable issue of fact.

She also had relationships with Rock Brynner (son of Yul Brynner), Mikhail Baryshnikov, Billy Stritch, and film director Martin Scorsese. Her close friendship with French pop singer Charles Aznavour was described by Aznavour as &quot;more than friends and less than lovers.&quot;

Minnelli has no children despite numerous attempts; one pregnancy left her with a hiatal hernia as a result of the medical steps taken to try to save the baby.

===Philanthropy===
Throughout her lifetime, Minnelli has served on various charities and causes. She served on the board of directors of The Institutes for The Achievement of Human Potential (IAHP) for 20 years, a nonprofit educational organization that introduces parents to the field of child brain development. In a 2006 interview with Randy Rice at Broadwayworld.com, Minnelli said that she was the person who told Elizabeth Taylor about HIV/AIDS while talking about their mutual friend Rock Hudson. She has also dedicated much time to amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research, which was co-founded by Taylor.

In 2007, she stated in an interview with &quot;Palm Springs Life&quot;: &quot;AmfAR is important to me because I&#x27;ve lost so many friends that I knew [to AIDS]&quot;. In 1994, she recorded the Kander &amp; Ebb tune &quot;The Day After That&quot; and donated the proceeds to AIDS research. The same year, she performed the song in front of thousands in Central Park at the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall riots.

<text>In elementary algebra, the quadratic formula is a closed-form expression describing the solutions of a quadratic equation. Other ways of solving quadratic equations, such as completing the square, yield the same solutions.

Given a general quadratic equation of the form , with representing an unknown, and coefficients , , and representing known real or complex numbers with , the values of satisfying the equation, called the &quot;roots&quot; or &quot;zeros&quot;, can be found using the quadratic formula,

formula_1

where the plus–minus symbol &quot;&quot; indicates that the equation has two roots. Written separately, these are:

formula_2

The quantity is known as the discriminant of the quadratic equation. If the coefficients , , and are real numbers then when , the equation has two distinct real roots; when , the equation has one repeated real root; and when , the equation has &quot;no&quot; real roots but has two distinct complex roots, which are complex conjugates of each other.

Geometrically, the roots represent the values at which the graph of the quadratic function , a parabola, crosses the -axis: the graph&#x27;s -intercepts. The quadratic formula can also be used to identify the parabola&#x27;s axis of symmetry.

== Derivation by completing the square ==
The standard way to derive the quadratic formula is to apply the method of completing the square to the generic quadratic equation . The idea is to manipulate the equation into the form for some expressions and written in terms of the coefficients; take the square root of both sides; and then isolate .

We start by dividing the equation by the quadratic coefficient , which is allowed because is non-zero. Afterwards, we subtract the constant term to isolate it on the right-hand side:

formula_3

The left-hand side is now of the form , and we can &quot;complete the square&quot; by adding a constant to obtain a squared binomial . In this example we add to both sides so that the left-hand side can be factored (see the figure):

formula_4

Because the left-hand side is now a perfect square, we can easily take the square root of both sides:

formula_5

Finally, subtracting from both sides to isolate produces the quadratic formula:

formula_6

== Equivalent formulations ==
The quadratic formula can equivalently be written using various alternative expressions, for instance

formula_7

which can be derived by first dividing a quadratic equation by , resulting in , then substituting the new coefficients into the standard quadratic formula. Because this variant allows re-use of the intermediately calculated quantity , it can slightly reduce the arithmetic involved.

=== Square root in the denominator ===
A lesser known quadratic formula, first mentioned by Giulio Fagnano, describes the same roots via an equation with the square root in the denominator (assuming ):

formula_8

Here the minus–plus symbol &quot;&quot; indicates that the two roots of the quadratic equation, in the same order as the standard quadratic formula, are

formula_9

This variant has been jokingly called the &quot;citardauq&quot; formula (&quot;quadratic&quot; spelled backwards).

When has the opposite sign as either or , subtraction can cause catastrophic cancellation, resulting in poor accuracy in numerical calculations; choosing between the version of the quadratic formula with the square root in the numerator or denominator depending on the sign of can avoid this problem. See below.

This version of the quadratic formula is used in Muller&#x27;s method for finding the roots of general functions. It can be derived from the standard formula from the identity , one of Vieta&#x27;s formulas. Alternately, it can be derived by dividing each side of the equation by to get , applying the standard formula to find the two roots , and then taking the reciprocal to find the roots of the original equation.

== Other derivations ==
Any generic method or algorithm for solving quadratic equations can be applied to an equation with symbolic coefficients and used to derive some closed-form expression equivalent to the quadratic formula. Alternative methods are sometimes simpler than completing the square, and may offer interesting insight into other areas of mathematics.

=== Completing the square by Śrīdhara&#x27;s method ===
Instead of dividing by to isolate , it can be slightly simpler to multiply by instead to produce , which allows us to complete the square without need for fractions. Then the steps of the derivation are:

# Multiply each side by .
# Add to both sides to complete the square.
# Take the square root of both sides.
# Isolate .

Applying this method to a generic quadratic equation with symbolic coefficients yields the quadratic formula:

formula_10

This method for completing the square is ancient and was known to the 8th–9th century Indian mathematician Śrīdhara. Compared with the modern standard method for completing the square, this alternate method avoids fractions until the last step and hence does not require a rearrangement after step 3 to obtain a common denominator in the right side.

===By substitution===
Another derivation uses a change of variables to eliminate the linear term. Then the equation takes the form in terms of a new variable and some constant expression , whose roots are then .

By substituting into , expanding the products and combining like terms, and then solving for , we have:

formula_11

Finally, after taking a square root of both sides and substituting the resulting expression for back into the familiar quadratic formula emerges:

formula_12

===By using algebraic identities===
The following method was used by many historical mathematicians:

Let the roots of the quadratic equation be and . The derivation starts from an identity for the square of a difference (valid for any two complex numbers), of which we can take the square root on both sides:

formula_13

Since the coefficient , we can divide the quadratic equation by to obtain a monic polynomial with the same roots. Namely,

formula_14

This implies that the sum and the product . Thus the identity can be rewritten:

formula_15

Therefore,

formula_16

The two possibilities for each of and are the same two roots in opposite order, so we can combine them into the standard quadratic equation:
formula_17

===By Lagrange resolvents===

An alternative way of deriving the quadratic formula is via the method of Lagrange resolvents, which is an early part of Galois theory.
This method can be generalized to give the roots of cubic polynomials and quartic polynomials, and leads to Galois theory, which allows one to understand the solution of algebraic equations of any degree in terms of the symmetry group of their roots, the Galois group.

This approach focuses on the roots themselves rather than algebraically rearranging the original equation. Given a monic quadratic polynomial assume that and are the two roots. So the polynomial factors as

formula_18

which implies and .

Since multiplication and addition are both commutative, exchanging the roots and will not change the coefficients and : one can say that and are symmetric polynomials in and . Specifically, they are the elementary symmetric polynomials – any symmetric polynomial in and can be expressed in terms of and instead.

The Galois theory approach to analyzing and solving polynomials is to ask whether, given coefficients of a polynomial each of which is a symmetric function in the roots, one can &quot;break&quot; the symmetry and thereby recover the roots. Using this approach, solving a polynomial of degree is related to the ways of rearranging (&quot;permuting&quot;) terms, called the symmetric group on letters and denoted . For the quadratic polynomial, the only ways to rearrange two roots are to either leave them be or to transpose them, so solving a quadratic polynomial is simple.

To find the roots and , consider their sum and difference:

formula_19

These are called the &quot;Lagrange resolvents&quot; of the polynomial, from which the roots can be recovered as

formula_20

Because is a symmetric function in and , it can be expressed in terms of and specifically as described above. However, is not symmetric, since exchanging and yields the additive inverse . So cannot be expressed in terms of the symmetric polynomials. However, its square &quot;is&quot; symmetric in the roots, expressible in terms of and . Specifically , which implies . Taking the positive root &quot;breaks&quot; the symmetry, resulting in

formula_21

from which the roots and are recovered as

formula_22

which is the quadratic formula for a monic polynomial.

Substituting , yields the usual expression for an arbitrary quadratic polynomial. The resolvents can be recognized as

formula_23

respectively the vertex and the discriminant of the monic polynomial.

A similar but more complicated method works for cubic equations, which have three resolvents and a quadratic equation (the &quot;resolving polynomial&quot;) relating and , which one can solve by the quadratic equation, and similarly for a quartic equation (degree 4), whose resolving polynomial is a cubic, which can in turn be solved. The same method for a quintic equation yields a polynomial of degree 24, which does not simplify the problem, and, in fact, solutions to quintic equations in general cannot be expressed using only roots.

== Numerical calculation ==

The quadratic formula is exactly correct when performed using the idealized arithmetic of real numbers, but when approximate arithmetic is used instead, for example pen-and-paper arithmetic carried out to a fixed number of decimal places or the floating-point binary arithmetic available on computers, the limitations of the number representation can lead to substantially inaccurate results unless great care is taken in the implementation. Specific difficulties include catastrophic cancellation in computing the sum if ; catastrophic calculation in computing the discriminant itself in cases where ; degeneration of the formula when , , or is represented as zero or infinite; and possible overflow or underflow when multiplying or dividing extremely large or small numbers, even in cases where the roots can be accurately represented.

Catastrophic cancellation occurs when two numbers which are approximately equal are subtracted. While each of the numbers may independently be representable to a certain number of digits of precision, the identical leading digits of each number cancel, resulting in a difference of lower relative precision. When , evaluation of causes catastrophic cancellation, as does the evaluation of when . When using the standard quadratic formula, calculating one of the two roots always involves addition, which preserves the working precision of the intermediate calculations, while calculating the other root involves subtraction, which compromises it. Therefore, naïvely following the standard quadratic formula often yields one result with less relative precision than expected. Unfortunately, introductory algebra textbooks typically do not address this problem, even though it causes students to obtain inaccurate results in other school subjects such as introductory chemistry.

For example, if trying to solve the equation using a pocket calculator, the result of the quadratic formula might be approximately calculated as:

formula_24

Even though the calculator used ten decimal digits of precision for each step, calculating the difference between two approximately equal numbers has yielded a result for with only four correct digits.

One way to recover an accurate result is to use the identity . In this example can be calculated as , which is correct to the full ten digits. Another more or less equivalent approach is to use the version of the quadratic formula with the square root in the denominator to calculate one of the roots (see above).

Practical computer implementations of the solution of quadratic equations commonly choose which formula to use for each root depending on the sign of .

These methods do not prevent possible overflow or underflow of the floating-point exponent in computing or , which can lead to numerically representable roots not being computed accurately. A more robust but computationally expensive strategy is to start with the substitution , turning the quadratic equation into

formula_25

where is the sign function. Letting , this equation has the form , for which one solution is and the other solution is . The roots of the original equation are then and .

With additional complication the expense and extra rounding of the square roots can be avoided by approximating them as powers of two, while still avoiding exponent overflow for representable roots.

==Historical development==
The earliest methods for solving quadratic equations were geometric. Babylonian cuneiform tablets contain problems reducible to solving quadratic equations. The Egyptian Berlin Papyrus, dating back to the Middle Kingdom (2050 BC to 1650 BC), contains the solution to a two-term quadratic equation.

The Greek mathematician Euclid (circa 300 BC) used geometric methods to solve quadratic equations in Book 2 of his &quot;Elements&quot;, an influential mathematical treatise Rules for quadratic equations appear in the Chinese &quot;The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot; circa 200 BC. In his work &quot;Arithmetica&quot;, the Greek mathematician Diophantus (circa 250 AD) solved quadratic equations with a method more recognizably algebraic than the geometric algebra of Euclid. His solution gives only one root, even when both roots are positive.

The Indian mathematician Brahmagupta included a generic method for finding one root of a quadratic equation in his treatise &quot;Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta&quot; (circa 628 AD), written out in words in the style of the time but more or less equivalent to the modern symbolic formula. His solution of the quadratic equation was as follows: &quot;To the absolute number multiplied by four times the [coefficient of the] square, add the square of the [coefficient of the] middle term; the square root of the same, less the [coefficient of the] middle term, being divided by twice the [coefficient of the] square is the value.&quot;
In modern notation, this can be written . The Indian mathematician Śrīdhara (8th–9th century) came up with a similar algorithm for solving quadratic equations in a now-lost work on algebra quoted by Bhāskara II. The modern quadratic formula is sometimes called &quot;Sridharacharya&#x27;s formula&quot; in India and &quot;Bhaskara&#x27;s formula&quot; in Brazil.

The 9th-century Persian mathematician Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī solved quadratic equations algebraically. The quadratic formula covering all cases was first obtained by Simon Stevin in 1594. In 1637 René Descartes published &quot;La Géométrie&quot; containing special cases of the quadratic formula in the form we know today.

==Geometric significance==
In terms of coordinate geometry, an axis-aligned parabola is a curve whose -coordinates are the graph of a second-degree polynomial, of the form , where , , and are real-valued constant coefficients with .

Geometrically, the quadratic formula defines the points on the graph, where the parabola crosses the -axis. Furthermore, it can be separated into two terms,

formula_26

The first term describes the axis of symmetry, the line . The second term, , gives the distance the roots are away from the axis of symmetry.

If the parabola&#x27;s vertex is on the -axis, then the corresponding equation has a single repeated root on the line of symmetry, and this distance term is zero; algebraically, the discriminant .

If the discriminant is positive, then the vertex is not on the -axis but the parabola opens in the direction of the -axis, crossing it twice, so the corresponding equation has two real roots. If the discriminant is negative, then the parabola opens in the opposite direction, never crossing the -axis, and the equation has no real roots; in this case the two complex-valued roots will be complex conjugates whose real part is the value of the axis of symmetry.

==Dimensional analysis==
If the constants , , and/or are not unitless then the quantities and must have the same units, because the terms and agree on their units. By the same logic, the coefficient must have the same units as , irrespective of the units of . This can be a powerful tool for verifying that a quadratic expression of physical quantities has been set up correctly.

<text>Gulf Oil was a major global oil company in operation from 1901 to 1985. The eighth-largest American manufacturing company in 1941 and the ninth largest in 1979, Gulf Oil was one of the Seven Sisters oil companies. Prior to its merger with Standard Oil of California, Gulf was one of the chief instruments of the Mellon family fortune; both Gulf and Mellon Financial had their headquarters in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, with Gulf&#x27;s headquarters, the Gulf Tower, being Pittsburgh&#x27;s tallest building until the completion of the U.S. Steel Tower.

Gulf Oil Corporation (GOC) ceased to exist as an independent company in 1985, when it merged with Standard Oil of California (SOCAL), with both rebranding as Chevron in the United States. Gulf Canada, Gulf&#x27;s main Canadian subsidiary, was sold the same year with retail outlets to Ultramar and Petro-Canada and what became Gulf Canada Resources to Olympia &amp; York. However, the Gulf brand name and a number of the constituent business divisions of GOC survived. Gulf has experienced a significant revival since 1990, emerging as a flexible network of allied business interests based on partnerships, franchises and agencies.

Gulf, in its present incarnation, is a &quot;new economy&quot; business. It employs very few people directly and its assets are mainly in the form of intellectual property: brands, product specifications and scientific expertise. The rights to the brand in the United States are owned by Gulf Oil Limited Partnership (GOLC), which operates over 2,100 service stations and several petroleum terminals; it is headquartered in Wellesley, Massachusetts. The corporate vehicle at the center of the Gulf network outside the United States, Spain and Portugal is Gulf Oil International, a company owned by the Hinduja Group. The company&#x27;s focus is primarily in the provision of downstream products and services to a mass market through joint ventures, strategic alliances, licensing agreements, and distribution arrangement. In Spain and Portugal, the Gulf brand is now owned by TotalEnergies SE.

== History ==

===1901–1982===

The business that became Gulf Oil started in 1901 with the discovery of oil at Spindletop oilfield near Beaumont, Texas. A group of investors came together to promote the development of a modern refinery at nearby Port Arthur to process the oil. The largest investors were Andrew Mellon and William Larimer Mellon Sr., of the Pittsburgh Mellon family. Other investors included many of Mellon&#x27;s Pennsylvania clients as well as some Texas wildcatters. Mellon Bank and Gulf Oil remained closely associated thereafter. The Gulf Oil Corporation itself was formed in 1907 through the amalgamation of a number of oil businesses, principally the J.M. Guffey Petroleum Company, Gulf Pipeline Company, and Gulf Refining companies of Texas. The name of the company refers to the Gulf of Mexico where Beaumont lies.
Output from Spindletop peaked at around just after it was discovered and then started to decline. Later discoveries made 1927 the peak year of Spindletop production, but Spindletop&#x27;s early decline forced Gulf to seek alternative sources of supply to sustain its substantial investment in refining capacity. This was achieved by constructing the 400-mile (640 km) Glenn Pool pipeline connecting oilfields in Oklahoma with Gulf&#x27;s refinery at Port Arthur. The pipeline opened in September 1907. Gulf later built a network of pipelines and refineries in the eastern and southern United States, requiring heavy capital investment. Thus, Gulf Oil provided Mellon Bank with a secure vehicle for investing in the oil sector.

Gulf promoted the concept of branded product sales by selling fuel in containers and from pumps marked with a distinctive orange disc logo. A customer buying Gulf-branded fuel could be assured of its quality and consistent standard. (In the early 20th century, non-branded fuel in the United States was often contaminated or of unreliable quality).

Gulf Oil grew steadily in the inter-war years, with its activities mainly confined to the United States. The company was characterized by its vertically integrated business activities and was active across the whole spectrum of the oil industry: exploration, production, transport, refining and marketing. It also involved itself in associated industries such as petrochemicals and automobile component manufacturing. It introduced significant commercial and technical innovations, including the first drive-in service station (1913), complimentary road maps, drilling over water at Ferry Lake, and the catalytic cracking refining process (Gulf installed the world&#x27;s first commercial catalytic cracking unit at its Port Arthur, Texas refinery complex in 1951). Gulf also established the model for the integrated, international &quot;oil major&quot;, which refers to one of a group of very large companies that assumed influential and sensitive positions in the countries in which they operated. In 1924, it acquired the Venezuelan-American Creole Syndicate&#x27;s leases in the strip of shallow water 1.5 kilometers (0.93 mi) wide along the Lake Maracaibo east shore.

In Colombia, Gulf purchased the Barco oil concession in 1926. The government of Colombia revoked the concession the same year, but after much negotiation Gulf won it back in 1931. However, during a period of over-capacity, Gulf was more interested in holding the reserve than developing it. In 1936 Gulf sold Barco to the Texas Corporation, now Texaco, and they would eventually all merge as Chevron.

Gulf had extensive exploration and production operations in the Gulf of Mexico, Canada, and Kuwait. The company played a major role in the early development of oil production in Kuwait, and through the 1950s and &#x27;60s apparently enjoyed a &quot;special relationship&quot; with the Kuwaiti government. This special relationship attracted unfavorable attention since it was associated with &quot;political contributions&quot; (see below) and support for anti-democratic politics, as evidenced by papers taken from the body of a Gulf executive killed in the crash of a TWA aircraft at Cairo in 1950.
In 1934, the Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) was formed as a joint venture by Anglo-Persian Oil Company (APOC) (now BP, and Gulf. Both APOC and Gulf held equal shares in the venture. KOC pioneered the exploration for oil in Kuwait during the late 1930s. Oil was discovered at Burgan in 1938, but it was not until 1946 that the first crude oil was shipped. Oil production started from Rawdhatain in 1955 and Minagish in 1959. KOC started gas production in 1964. It was the cheap oil and fuel being shipped from Kuwait that formed the economic basis for Gulf&#x27;s diverse petroleum sector operations in Europe, the Mediterranean, Africa, and the Indian subcontinent. These last operations were coordinated by Gulf Oil Company, Eastern Hemisphere Ltd. (GOCEH) from their offices at 2 Portman Street in London W1. While serving as General Manager and Vice President of Gulf Oil, Willard F. Jones facilitated the expansion of crude oil import from Kuwait, a nation that was - at the time - a yet incipient supply region to the United States. This expansion program implemented by Robert E. Garret and Jones consisted of construction of a fleet of supertankers and was meant to &quot;result in a sharp increase in the processing of crude oil and various petroleum products at a time when the domestic demand for (such) products (was) at an unprecedented peak.&quot;
Gulf expanded on a worldwide basis from the end of the Second World War. The company leveraged its international drilling experience to other areas of the world, and by mid-1943 had established a presence in the eastern oil fields of Venezuela as the Mene Grande Oil Company (See San Tomé, Venezuela). Much of the company&#x27;s retail sales expansion was through the acquisition of privately owned chains of filling stations in various countries, allowing Gulf outlets to sell product (sometimes through &quot;matching&quot; arrangements) from the oil that it was &quot;lifting&quot; in Canada, the Gulf of Mexico, Kuwait, and Venezuela. Some of these acquisitions were to prove less than resilient in the face of economic and political developments from the 1970s on. Gulf invested heavily in product technology and developed many specialty products, particularly for application in the maritime and aviation engineering sectors. It was particularly noted for its range of lubricants and greases.
Gulf Oil reached the peak of its development around 1970. In that year, the company processed of crude daily, held assets worth $6.5 billion ($ billion today), employed 58,000 employees worldwide, and was owned by 163,000 shareholders. In addition to its petroleum marketing interests, Gulf was a major producer of petrochemicals, plastics, and agricultural chemicals. Through its subsidiary, Gulf General Atomic, Inc., it was also active in the nuclear energy sector. Gulf abandoned its involvement in the nuclear sector after a failed deal to build atomic power plants in Romania in the mid-1970s.

In 1974, the Kuwait National Assembly took a 60 percent stake in the equity of KOC with the remaining 40 percent divided equally between BP and Gulf. The Kuwaitis took over the rest of the equity in 1975, giving them full ownership of KOC. This meant that Gulf (EH) had to start supplying its downstream operations in Europe with crude bought on the world market at commercial prices. The whole GOC(EH) edifice now became highly marginal in an economic sense. Many of the marketing companies that Gulf had established in Europe were never truly viable on a stand-alone basis. In 1976 during the nationalization of Venezuelan oil, the transfer of properties, benefits, equipment of Gulf Oil to PDVSA was carried out without any setback and with full satisfaction on both parts.

Gulf was at the forefront of various projects in the late 1960s intended to adjust the world oil industry to developments of the time including closure of the Suez Canal after the 1967 war. In particular, Gulf undertook the construction of deep-water terminals at Bantry Bay in Ireland and Okinawa in Japan capable of handling Ultra Large Crude Carrier (ULCC) vessels serving the European and Asian markets respectively. In 1968, the &quot;Universe Ireland&quot; was added to Gulf&#x27;s tanker fleet. At , this was the largest vessel in the world and incapable of berthing at most normal ports.

Gulf also participated in a partnership with other majors, including Texaco, to build the Pembroke Catalytic Cracker refinery at Milford Haven and the associated Mainline Pipelines fuel distribution network. The eventual reopening of the Suez Canal and upgrading of the older European oil terminals (Europoort and Marchwood) meant that the financial return from these projects was not all that had been hoped for. The Bantry terminal was devastated by the explosion of a Total tanker, the M/V &quot;Betelgeuse&quot;, in January 1979 (Whiddy Island disaster) and it was never fully reopened. The Irish government took over ownership of the terminal in 1986 and held its strategic oil reserve there.

In the 1970s, Gulf participated in the development of new oilfields in the UK North Sea and in Cabinda, although these were high-cost operations that never compensated for the loss of Gulf&#x27;s interest in Kuwait. A mercenary army had to be raised to protect the oil installations in Cabinda during the Angolan civil war. The Angolan connection was another &quot;special relationship&quot; that attracted comment. In the late 1970s, Gulf was effectively funding a Soviet bloc regime in Africa while the US government was attempting to overthrow that regime by supporting the UNITA rebels led by Jonas Savimbi.

In 1975, several senior Gulf executives, including chairman Bob Dorsey, were implicated in the making of illegal &quot;political contributions&quot; and were forced to step down from their positions. This loss of senior personnel at a critical time in Gulf&#x27;s fortunes may have had a bearing on the events that followed.

Gulf&#x27;s operations worldwide were struggling financially in the recession of the early 1980s, so Gulf&#x27;s management devised the &quot;Big Jobber&quot; strategic realignment in 1981 (along with a program of selective divestments) to maintain viability. The Big Jobber strategy recognized that the day of the integrated, multi-national oil major might be over, since it involved concentrating on those parts of the supply chain where Gulf had a competitive advantage.

===Marketing and promotions===
In the late 1930s, Gulf&#x27;s aviation manager, Major Alford J. Williams, had the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation construct two modified biplanes, cleaned-up versions of the Grumman F3F Navy fighter, for promotional use by the company. Wearing Gulf Oil company colors and logos, the Grumman G-22 &quot;Gulfhawk II&quot;, registered &quot;NR1050&quot;, was delivered in December 1936, and in 1938 Maj. Williams flew it on a tour of Europe. A second scavenger pump and five drain lines were added to the engine installation that allowed the aircraft to be flown inverted for up to thirty minutes. This aircraft is now preserved in the National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. A second airplane, the Grumman G-32 &quot;Gulfhawk III&quot;, registered &quot;NC1051&quot;, was delivered on May 6, 1938. Impressed by the Army Air Force in November 1942 for use as a VIP transport and designated a UC-103, it crashed in the southern Florida Everglades in early 1943.

Gulf Oil was the primary sponsor for NBC News special events coverage in the 1960s, notably for coverage of the U.S. space program. It also became a sponsor for a program called NBC News Special Report. The logo even appeared on the front cross-shaped desk of every special event and coverage broadcast by the network and it was notably used by Chet Huntley and David Brinkley or the other correspondents since the 1964 Republican National Convention. The company used the connection to its advantage by offering giveaway or promotional items at its stations, including sticker sheets of space mission logos, a paper punch-out lunar module model kit, and a book titled &quot;We Came in Peace,&quot; containing pictures of the Apollo 11 Moon landing. Gulf was also a major sponsor of &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot;, which also aired on NBC. Disney magazines and activity books were often given away with a gas fill-up. Gulf was also noted for its &quot;Tourgide&quot; road maps.

One particularly memorable Gulf advertisement carried by NBC during their coverage of the Apollo missions showed aerial and onboard views of the &quot;Universe Ireland&quot; with Tommy Makem and the Clancy Brothers singing &quot;Bringin&#x27; Home the Oil&quot; – a tribute to the opening of Gulf&#x27;s operations in Bantry Bay.
In 1937, Gulf Oil became involved in racing when they purchased the racing car project of Ira Vail and Harry Miller and brought the project into the Gulf Research and Development Company. This produced innovative new cars that were the designs of Miller which became the first mid-engined cars to race in the Indianapolis 500. The cars also featured four-wheel-drive which was very novel at the time, disc brakes and a supercharged 6-cylinder engine. The only notable restriction was that the engine needed to run on standard Gulf pump fuel. Four of the cars were built with 3-liter engines and one was entered in the 1938 &quot;500&quot; but did not qualify as much testing was needed to get the car to the point of being ready for competition. Three of the Gulf-Miller cars were entered in 1939 with one, driven by George Bailey making the race with a second-row qualifying position. Another of the cars was crashed in practice and the third didn&#x27;t attempt qualifying. The Bailey car dropped out of the race with a broken valve. In 1940, a fatal practice accident caused the team to withdraw. In 1941, two of the Gulf cars qualified but one was destroyed in a race morning garage fire and the other dropped out of the race early. Gulf sold the car in 1946 to Preston Tucker who ran it as the &quot;Tucker Torpedo Special&quot; that year in its last race appearance.

Gulf Oil was most synonymous for its association with auto racing, as it famously sponsored the John Wyer Automotive team in the 1960s and early &#x27;70s. The signature light blue and orange color scheme associated with its Ford GT40 and Porsche 917 is one of the most famous corporate racing colors and has been replicated by other racing teams sponsored by Gulf. Much of its popularity is attributed to the fact that in the 1971 film &quot;Le Mans&quot;, Steve McQueen&#x27;s character, &quot;Michael Delaney&quot;, drives for the Gulf team. As a result of McQueen&#x27;s increasing popularity following his death and the increasing popularity of the Heuer Monaco which he wore in the film, TAG Heuer released a limited edition of the watch with the Gulf logo and trademark color scheme. In the same era, Gulf Oil also sponsored Team McLaren during the Bruce McLaren days, which used a papaya orange color scheme with Gulf blue for lettering.

From 1963 to 1980, Gulf Oil had a formal agreement with Holiday Inn, the world&#x27;s largest lodging chain, for which Holiday Inn&#x27;s in the U.S. and Canada would accept Gulf credit cards for food and lodging. In return, Gulf placed service stations on the premises of many Holiday Inn properties along major U.S. highways to provide one-stop availability for fuel, auto service, food and lodging. Many older Holiday Inns still have those original Gulf stations on their properties, some in operation and some closed, but few operate today as Gulf stations.

Gulf No-Nox fuel was promoted with a bucking horse leaving an imprint of two horseshoes. Several promotions centered on the two horseshoes. In 1966, bright orange 3-D plastic self-adhesive horseshoes for car bumpers were given away. Another popular giveaway was during the 1968 election season, gold horseshoe lapel pins featuring either a Democratic donkey or a Republican elephant.

== Demise ==
By 1980, Gulf exhibited many of the characteristics of a giant corporation that had lost its way. It had a huge but poorly performing asset portfolio, associated with a depressed share price. The stock market value of Gulf started to drop below the break-up value of its assets. Such a situation was bound to attract the interest of corporate raiders, although a corporation in the top 100 of the Fortune 500 was in the early 1980s thought immune to takeover risk.

Its undoing as an independent company began in 1982 when T. Boone Pickens, an Amarillo, Texas, oilman and corporate raider (or greenmailer), and owner of Mesa Petroleum, made an offer for the comparatively larger (but still considered &quot;non-major&quot; oil company) Cities Service Company (more generally known by the name Citgo) from Tulsa, Oklahoma which was then trading in the low 20s. Pickens first privately offered $45 a share for a friendly takeover and then later made a $50 a share public offer when Cities&#x27; CEO rejected the friendly offer. Gulf forestalled Mesa&#x27;s takeover attempt by offering $63 a share in a friendly offer which Cities (by then trading at $37) accepted. Cities then bought out Pickens for $55 a share. Once Pickens was gone, Gulf reneged on its buyout offer, supposedly over a dispute regarding accuracy of Cities Service&#x27;s reserves, and the stock price of Cities plunged, triggering stockholder lawsuits as well as distrust for Gulf&#x27;s management on Wall Street and among financing investment banks who bet big in assisting Gulf to defeat Mesa only to be left broke when Gulf backed out. Cities Service was ultimately sold to Occidental Petroleum, and the retail operations were resold to Southland Corporation, the operators of 7-Eleven stores. Gulf&#x27;s termination of the Cities Service acquisition resulted in more than 15 years of shareholder litigation against Gulf (and later Chevron).
With declining margins in the industry and left without Citgo&#x27;s reserves, Mesa and its investor partners kept hunting for a takeover target, only to discover while fighting Gulf for Citgo how increasingly top-heavy its portfolio and declining reserves were undervaluing its overall assets. They subtly but quickly acquired 4.9 percent of Gulf Oil&#x27;s stock by early fall 1983, just shy of having to declare themselves and their intent at 5 percent to the SEC. In the ten days allowed to prepare the SEC filing, Mesa and its investor partners accelerated buying to 11 percent of the company&#x27;s stock, larger than the founding Mellon family&#x27;s share, by October 1983. Gulf responded to Mesa&#x27;s interest by calling a shareholders&#x27; meeting for late November 1983 and subsequently engaged in a proxy war on changing the corporation&#x27;s by-laws to minimize arbitrage. Pickens made loud criticisms of the existing Gulf management and offered an alternative business plan intended to release shareholder value through a royalty trust that management argued would &quot;slim down&quot; Gulf&#x27;s market share. Pickens had acquired the reputation of being a corporate raider whose skill lay in making profits out of bidding for companies but without actually acquiring them. During the early 1980s alone, he made failed bids for Cities Service, General American Oil, Gulf, Phillips Petroleum and Unocal. The process of making such bids would promote a frenzy of asset divestiture and debt reduction in the target companies. This is a standard defensive tactic calculated to boost the current share price, although possibly at the expense of long-term strategic advantage. The target shares would rise sharply in price, at which point Pickens would dispose of his interest at a substantial profit.

Gulf management and directors took the view that the Mesa bid represented an undervaluation of the Gulf business as a long-term going concern and that it was not in the interest of Gulf shareholders. James Lee, Gulf&#x27;s CEO and Chairman, even claimed during the November 1983 shareholders meeting to address the Mesa ownership that Pickens&#x27; royalty trust idea was nothing more than a &quot;get-rich-quick scheme&quot; that would undermine the corporation&#x27;s profit potential in the coming decades. Gulf, therefore, sought to resist Pickens by various means, including refiling as a Delaware corporation, voiding the ability of shareholders to cumulatively vote (fearing that Pickens would use his shares to gain control of the board) and listening to offers from Ashland Oil (which would double Gulf&#x27;s price from its pre-Mesa level), General Electric (two years before it took over the media company NBC/RCA) and finally Chevron to act as its white knight in 1984. Gulf divested many of its worldwide operating subsidiaries and then merged with Chevron by the spring of 1985. The Mesa group of investors was reported to have made a profit of $760 million ($ billion today) when it assigned its Gulf shares to Chevron. Pickens has claimed that after realizing a more than doubling of stock appreciation for Gulf shareholders (as well as its management that fought him at every turn), Mesa&#x27;s shares were the last to be paid out by Chevron.

The forced merger of Gulf and Chevron was controversial, with the U.S. Senate considering legislation to freeze oil industry mergers for a year—before the Reagan administration made it known it opposed government intervention in the matter and would veto any bill. However, Pickens and Lee (Gulf&#x27;s CEO) were summoned to testify before the Senate months before the merger was hammered out and the matter was referred to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). The FTC only approved the deal subject to strict conditions. Never before had a &quot;small operator&quot; successfully taken apart a Fortune 500 corporation, or in Gulf&#x27;s case a &quot;Fortune 10&quot; corporation. The merger sent even deeper shock waves through the long-time exclusive &quot;Seven Sisters&quot; club of major integrated oil companies that defined themselves as elevated from the &quot;non-major independents&quot;. A board member of Exxon even admitted in the mid-1980s that &quot;mostly all we talk about in board meetings anymore is T. Boone Pickens&quot;. Chevron, to settle with the government antitrust requirements, sold some Gulf stations and a refinery in the eastern United States to British Petroleum (BP) and Cumberland Farms in 1985 as well as some of the international operations.

The effect on the Pittsburgh area was severe as close to 900 PhD and research jobs and 600 headquarters (accounting, law, clerical) jobs were transferred to California or cut, a payroll of $54 million ($ million today) and corporate charity to 50 Western Pennsylvania organizations worth $2 million/year ($ million/year today). These losses were mitigated some with the donation of Gulf Labs in suburban north Pittsburgh to the University of Pittsburgh to be used as a research business incubator along with $5 million ($ million today) in maintenance and seed money. The &quot;Gulf Labs&quot; research complex consisted of 55 multi-story buildings with on and including several chemical labs, petroleum production and refining areas and even a nuclear laboratory complete with reactor in 1985 and employed close to 2,000 engineers and scientists operating with a $100 million budget ($ million today) from Gulf/Chevron. After its donation, it was renamed the University of Pittsburgh Applied Research Center or U-PARC and opened to small technology, computer and engineering firms as well as graduate level research.

== Aftermath ==
BP, Chevron, Cumberland Farms and other companies that acquired former Gulf operations continued to use the Gulf name through the early 1990s. This caused consumer confusion in the US retail market as the parent companies would not accept each other&#x27;s credit cards. All former Gulf stations franchised by BP and Chevron in the United States have since been converted to those names. Gulf Oil Limited Partnership (GOLP), based in Framingham, Massachusetts, has bought a license for North American rights to the Gulf brand from Chevron. Chevron still owned the Gulf brand, but was making almost no direct use of it. In January 2010, GOLP bought the entire brand from Chevron and began a nationwide expansion campaign. GOLP operates a distribution network reaching from Maine to Ohio. Most Gulf-branded filling stations in North America are owned by Cumberland Farms of Framingham, which owns a two-thirds interest in GOLP. In addition there are some independently owned franchises still operating under the Gulf brand within North America, such as Nu-Tier Brands, Inc., which is licensed by GOLP to blend and distribute Gulf-branded lubricants.
Gulf Oil International (GOI) owns the rights to the Gulf brand outside the United States, Spain &amp; Portugal. It is now owned by the Hinduja Group. After they acquired a large share from the Taher family, a major Saudi Arabian family led by Dr. Abdulhadi H. Taher (former governor of the Saudi Petroleum and Mineral organization and board member of Aramco). GOI trades mainly in lubricants, oils, and greases. GOI is also involved in franchising the Gulf brand to operators in the petroleum and automotive sectors; Gulf-branded filling stations can be found in several countries including the UK, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Slovakia, Czechia, the Netherlands, Jordan, Finland, Armenia and Turkey. GOI has direct and indirect interests in a number of businesses that use the Gulf brand under license.

The Canadian exploration, production, and distribution arm of Gulf Oil was sold to Olympia and York in 1985. From 1992 it continued as an independent oil company (Gulf Canada Resources) until its acquisition by Conoco in 2002.

Most Gulf downstream operations in Europe were sold to the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) in early 1983. The associated Gulf filling stations were converted to trade under the Q8 brand by 1988. However, attempts to sell Gulf Oil (Great Britain) to KPC failed because of irrevocable GOC guarantees given earlier in regard to bonds issued to finance the construction of refinery facilities in the UK. GO(GB) was taken over by Chevron and its stations continued to use the Gulf brand name and insignia until 1997 when the network was sold to Shell, although by this stage a fairly large proportion of Gulf stations were supplied by jobbers rather than Gulf Oil (GB). Gulf completely withdrew from the UK in 1997. This represented the end of the last major &quot;downstream&quot; use of the Gulf brand by Chevron. In the UK, the Gulf brand is now licensed by Certas Energy (GB Oils), who also now own the Pace brand, which was coincidentally formerly owned by the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation.

== Revival ==
GOI and GOLP continue to sell Gulf-branded lubricants worldwide through a network of official licensed companies, joint ventures and wholly owned subsidiary companies. Many of these official Gulf distributors carry out local marketing and sponsorship which help to raise the profile of the brand. Of these wholly owned subsidiaries Gulf Oil Corporation India has raised the market profile of the Gulf brand in the Middle East. GOCL have emerged as one of leading lubricants brands in India and run many marketing sponsorships targeted at the ever-growing youth sector in the country.

GOI licenses the Gulf brand and logo in the UK to the Bayford group, one of the largest independent fuel distributors. Starting in 2001, a new Gulf network of independent stations began appearing across the UK, many of which offered leaded &quot;four-star&quot; petrol, for which Bayford had a special dispensation to sell. At the same time, Gulf Lubricants (UK) Ltd was set up to market Gulf products in the UK, mostly manufactured by the Gulf Netherlands operation. This return by Gulf to the UK after a four-year absence used the slogan &quot;The Return of the Legend&quot;. The post-2001 Gulf presence in the UK is a wholly network-based operation. It involves almost no direct Gulf investment in fixed assets, corporate infrastructure, or manufacturing capability. This is a complete contrast to the pre-1997 presence.

In January 2010, after using the name since 1986, Gulf Oil LP acquired all right, title and interest in the Gulf brand name in the United States and announced plans to expand the use of the Gulf brand beyond its parent company&#x27;s Northeastern United States base. Its promotions have included sponsorship of major sporting events in the area with advertisements for Gulf in New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh. To take one case as an illustrative example of the Gulf revival, after Texaco&#x27;s 2001 merger with Chevron, many former Texaco stations in Pittsburgh switched to Gulf since Chevron does not service the Greater Pittsburgh area. As a result, the Texaco brand name disappeared from the area in June 2004 when the nonexclusive rights agreement with Shell expired, with Shell itself expanding in the area by means other than Texaco. However, in June 2006, Chevron gave exclusive rights to the Texaco brand name in the U.S. In New England, former Exxon stations have been rebranded as Gulf, in accordance with the consent decree that allowed the merger of Exxon and Mobil. Many of the former Exxon stations feature a rectangular logo that fit into the existing sign standards used by Exxon. Gulf refers to the look as its &quot;sunrise&quot; imaging.
The Gulf logo is still used around the world by various businesses. GOI uses it for their marketing activities to focus on the sponsorship of motorsport teams including MotoGP team Aprilia Racing Team Gresini for the 2019 season and Formula 1 teams McLaren and Williams. This sponsorship is used across the world by Gulf distributors, alongside local activity demonstrating the GOI company ethos of &quot;your local global brand&quot;. In July 2020, GOI announced a multi-year strategic partnership with long time partner McLaren which includes Gulf being the preferred lubricant supplier to McLaren Automotive and a special Gulf livery for the 2021 Monaco Grand Prix. In February 2023, GOI announced a multi-year partnership with Williams Racing. For the 2023 Singapore, Japan and Qatar Grands Prix, Williams raced a special Gulf livery chosen by a fan vote.

In March 2016, Gulf MX announced that they will put their own filling stations in Mexico, which is planned to begin operations in July of the same year to compete with the local company (PEMEX) (as a result of the recent changes in the local laws in matter of energy and oil resources). As said by Sergio De La Vega (CEO of Gulf Mexico), in order to improve a better service, Gulf will make fidelity programs and dedicated smartphone apps. for customers (improving fuel payment into the same, fuel administration and better experience with fidelity programs as another additional benefits) adding to modern service stations with more quality-added services.

== Pennsylvania Turnpike ==

Gulf operated filling stations on the Pennsylvania Turnpike alongside Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurants at the Turnpike&#x27;s travel plazas starting in 1950 with the opening of the Philadelphia Extension and continuing for decades, with Gulf adding more filling stations as the Turnpike was extended.

The Standard Oil Company of Pennsylvania (later Exxon) was the exclusive filling station franchisee on sections of the Turnpike that opened prior to 1950—principally, the Irwin–Carlisle section. Sunoco was also awarded franchises in the 1980s for the filling stations at the Sideling Hill and (now-closed) Hempfield travel plazas.

Gulf had the opportunity to become the exclusive filling station franchisee on the Turnpike after Exxon withdrew in 1990 and Cumberland Farms (owner of the Gulf brand in the northeastern U.S.) was awarded a new contract with the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission. However, the contract was sold to Sunoco two years later as part of Cumberland Farm&#x27;s bankruptcy proceedings, and all former Gulf filling stations on the Turnpike converted to Sunoco in June 1992, leaving Sunoco the sole brand of fuel on the Turnpike to this day.

== Gulf products ==
Most filling stations in Europe sell three types of fuel: unleaded, LRP, and diesel. Although these products lack any real brand differentiation, this has not always been the case. Until well into the 1970s, Gulf (in common with other oil companies) sold distinctive brands of petrol/gasoline including subregular Gulftane (briefly a midgrade low lead), Good Gulf regular, Gulf No-Nox premium, Gulf Super Unleaded, and Gulfcrest (Regular Unleaded). Gulfcrest was also a super premium grade in the 1950s and early 1960s. Gulf petrol was sold using the slogans &quot;Good Gulf Gasoline,&quot; and &quot;Gulf – the Gas with Guts.&quot; Gulf service stations often supplied customers with pens and key rings bearing these slogans. For a few years, beginning in 1966, Gulf stations in the U.S. gave away orange plastic &quot;Extra Kick Horseshoes&quot; to customers who filled their tanks with Gulf&#x27;s No-Nox premium fuel (the novelty items were commonly mounted on bumpers).

GOI still produces and sells a wide range of branded oil based products including lubricants and greases of all kinds. These include products for a variety of applications ranging from metal working oils to refrigeration oils. Car engine oils include the Gulf Formula, Gulf MAX, and Gulf TEC ranges. Heavy duty diesel engine lubricants include the Gulf Supreme and Gulf Superfleet ranges.

In the summer of 2013, Gulf Oil licensed the &quot;Gulf&quot; name for racing fuels in a return to the American racing scene for the 2014 competition season. The fuels were announced at the Performance Racing Industry Show in Indianapolis, Indiana, in December 2013. The racing fuels support the World Racing League and the Formula Atlantic Championship in the United States.

<text>The Sicarii were a group of Jewish Zealots, who, in the final decades of the Second Temple period, conducted a campaign of targeted assassinations and kidnappings of Roman officials in Judea and of Jews who collaborated with the Roman Empire. They later became known for a reported mass suicide at the Siege of Masada. The Sicarii carried &quot;sicae&quot;, or small daggers (sickles), concealed in their cloaks; at public gatherings, they pulled out these daggers to attack, blending into the crowd after the deed to escape detection.

The only source for the history of the Sicarii is Josephus. Victims of the Sicarii are said by Josephus to have included the High Priest Jonathan, and 700 Jewish women and children at Ein Gedi.

A relationship between the Zealots and the Sicarii is often stated, but is unclear from the original sources.

The Sicarii are one of the earliest known organized assassination units of cloak and daggers, predating the Order of Assassins and the Japanese ninja by centuries.

==Etymology==
In the Koine Greek of Josephus the term σικάριοι &quot;sikarioi&quot; was used. In Latin, &quot;Sicarii&quot; is the plural form of &quot;Sicarius&quot; &quot;dagger-man&quot;, &quot;sickle-man&quot;. &quot;Sica&quot;, possibly from Proto-Albanian *tsikā (whence Albanian &quot;thika&quot;, &quot;knife&quot;), from Proto-Indo-European *ḱey- (&quot;to sharpen&quot;) possibly via Illyrian. In later Latin usage, &quot;sicarius&quot; was also the standard term for a murderer (see, e.g., the &quot;Lex Cornelia de Sicariis et Veneficiis&quot;), and to this day &quot;sicario&quot; is a salaried assassin in Spanish and a commissioned murderer in Italian and Portuguese. 

The term Σικαρίων (Sikariōn) is used in Acts 21:38 of the New Testament as an accusation against Paul the Apostle. It is translated as &quot;terrorists&quot; in the New International Version, &quot;murderers&quot; in the King James Bible and &quot;assassins&quot; in the American Standard Version.

The derived Spanish term &quot;sicario&quot; is used in contemporary Latin America to describe a hitman.

==History==

Victims of the Sicarii are said by Josephus to have included the High Priest Jonathan, and 700 Jewish women and children at Ein Gedi. Some murders were met with severe retaliation by the Romans on the broader Jewish population of the region. However, on some occasions, the Sicarii would release their intended victim if their terms were met. Much of what is known about the Sicarii comes from the &quot;Antiquities of the Jews&quot; and &quot;The Jewish War&quot; by Josephus, who wrote that the Sicarii agreed to release the kidnapped secretary of Eleazar, governor of the Temple precincts, in exchange for the release of ten captured assassins.

At the beginning of the First Roman-Jewish War, the Sicarii, and (possibly) Zealot helpers (Josephus differentiated between the two but did not explain the main differences in depth), gained access to Jerusalem and committed a series of atrocities in an attempt to incite the population into war against Rome. In one account, given in the Talmud, they destroyed the city&#x27;s food supply, using starvation to force the people to fight against the Roman siege, instead of negotiating peace. Their leaders, including Menahem ben Yehuda and Eleazar ben Ya&#x27;ir, were notable figures in the war, and the group fought in many battles against the Romans as soldiers. Together with a small group of followers, Menahem made his way to the fortress of Masada, took over a Roman garrison and slaughtered all 700 soldiers there. They also took over another fortress called Antonia and overpowered the troops of Agrippa II. He also trained them to conduct various guerrilla operations on Roman convoys and legions stationed around Judea.

Josephus also wrote that the Sicarii raided nearby Hebrew villages including Ein Gedi, where they massacred 700 Jewish women and children.

The Zealots, Sicarii and other prominent rebels finally joined forces to attack and temporarily take Jerusalem from Rome in 66 AD, where they took control of the Temple in Jerusalem, executing anyone who tried to oppose their power. The local populace resisted their control and launched a series of sieges and raids to remove the rebel factions. The rebels eventually silenced the uprising and Jerusalem stayed in their hands for the duration of the war. The Romans returned to take back the city, counter-attacking and laying siege to starve the rebels inside. The rebels held out for some time, but the constant bickering and lack of leadership caused the groups to disintegrate. The leader of the Sicarii, Menahem, was killed by rival factions during an altercation. Finally, the Romans regained control and destroyed the whole city in 70 AD.

Eleazar and his followers returned to Masada and continued their rebellion against the Romans until 73 AD. The Romans eventually took the fortress and, according to Josephus, found that most of its defenders had died by suicide rather than surrender. In Josephus&#x27; &quot;The Jewish War&quot; (vii), after the fall of the Temple in AD 70, the &quot;sicarii&quot; became the dominant revolutionary Hebrew faction, scattered abroad. Josephus particularly associates them with the mass suicide at Masada in AD 73 and to the subsequent refusal &quot;to submit to the taxation census when Cyrenius was sent to Judea to make one,&quot; as part of their rebellion&#x27;s religious and political scheme.

Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the New Testament, was believed by some to be a sicarius. Modern historians typically reject this contention, mainly because Josephus in &quot;The War of the Hebrews&quot; (2:254–7) mentions the appearance of the Sicarii as a new phenomenon during the procuratorships of Felix (52–60 AD), having no apparent relation with the group called Sicarii by Romans at times of Quirinius. The 2nd century compendium of Jewish oral law, the Mishnah (&quot;Makhshirin&quot; 1:6), mentions the word &quot;sikrin&quot; (), perhaps related to Sicarii, and which is explained by the early rabbinic commentators as being related to the (= robbers), and to government personnel involved with implementing the laws of Sicaricon. Maimonides, in his Mishnah commentary (&quot;Makhshirin&quot; 1:6), explains the same word &quot;sikrin&quot; as meaning &quot;people who harass and who are disposed to being violent.&quot;

<text>In mathematics, a base (or basis; : bases) for the topology of a topological space is a family formula_1 of open subsets of such that every open set of the topology is equal to the union of some sub-family of formula_1. For example, the set of all open intervals in the real number line formula_3 is a basis for the Euclidean topology on formula_3 because every open interval is an open set, and also every open subset of formula_3 can be written as a union of some family of open intervals.

Bases are ubiquitous throughout topology. The sets in a base for a topology, which are called , are often easier to describe and use than arbitrary open sets. Many important topological definitions such as continuity and convergence can be checked using only basic open sets instead of arbitrary open sets. Some topologies have a base of open sets with specific useful properties that may make checking such topological definitions easier.

Not all families of subsets of a set formula_6 form a base for a topology on formula_6. Under some conditions detailed below, a family of subsets will form a base for a (unique) topology on formula_6, obtained by taking all possible unions of subfamilies. Such families of sets are very frequently used to define topologies. A weaker notion related to bases is that of a subbase for a topology. Bases for topologies are also closely related to neighborhood bases.

==Definition and basic properties==

Given a topological space formula_9, a base (or basis) for the topology formula_10 (also called a &quot;base for&quot; formula_6 if the topology is understood) is a family formula_12 of open sets such that every open set of the topology can be represented as the union of some subfamily of formula_1. The elements of formula_1 are called &quot;basic open sets&quot;.
Equivalently, a family formula_1 of subsets of formula_6 is a base for the topology formula_10 if and only if formula_12 and for every open set formula_19 in formula_6 and point formula_21 there is some basic open set formula_22 such that formula_23.

For example, the collection of all open intervals in the real line forms a base for the standard topology on the real numbers. More generally, in a metric space formula_24 the collection of all open balls about points of formula_24 forms a base for the topology.

In general, a topological space formula_9 can have many bases. The whole topology formula_10 is always a base for itself (that is, formula_10 is a base for formula_10). For the real line, the collection of all open intervals is a base for the topology. So is the collection of all open intervals with rational endpoints, or the collection of all open intervals with irrational endpoints, for example. Note that two different bases need not have any basic open set in common. One of the topological properties of a space formula_6 is the minimum cardinality of a base for its topology, called the weight of formula_6 and denoted formula_32. From the examples above, the real line has countable weight.

If formula_1 is a base for the topology formula_10 of a space formula_6, it satisfies the following properties:
:(B1) The elements of formula_1 &quot;cover&quot; formula_6, i.e., every point formula_38 belongs to some element of formula_1.
:(B2) For every formula_40 and every point formula_41, there exists some formula_42 such that formula_43.
Property (B1) corresponds to the fact that formula_6 is an open set; property (B2) corresponds to the fact that formula_45 is an open set.

Conversely, suppose formula_6 is just a set without any topology and formula_1 is a family of subsets of formula_6 satisfying properties (B1) and (B2). Then formula_1 is a base for the topology that it generates. More precisely, let formula_10 be the family of all subsets of formula_6 that are unions of subfamilies of formula_52 Then formula_10 is a topology on formula_6 and formula_1 is a base for formula_10.
(Sketch: formula_10 defines a topology because it is stable under arbitrary unions by construction, it is stable under finite intersections by (B2), it contains formula_6 by (B1), and it contains the empty set as the union of the empty subfamily of formula_1. The family formula_1 is then a base for formula_10 by construction.) Such families of sets are a very common way of defining a topology.

In general, if formula_6 is a set and formula_1 is an arbitrary collection of subsets of formula_6, there is a (unique) smallest topology formula_10 on formula_6 containing formula_1. (This topology is the intersection of all topologies on formula_6 containing formula_1.) The topology formula_10 is called the topology generated by formula_1, and formula_1 is called a subbase for formula_10. The topology formula_10 can also be characterized as the set of all arbitrary unions of finite intersections of elements of formula_1. (See the article about subbase.) Now, if formula_1 also satisfies properties (B1) and (B2), the topology generated by formula_1 can be described in a simpler way without having to take intersections: formula_10 is the set of all unions of elements of formula_1 (and formula_1 is a base for formula_10 in that case).

There is often an easy way to check condition (B2). If the intersection of any two elements of formula_1 is itself an element of formula_1 or is empty, then condition (B2) is automatically satisfied (by taking formula_84). For example, the Euclidean topology on the plane admits as a base the set of all open rectangles with horizontal and vertical sides, and a nonempty intersection of two such basic open sets is also a basic open set. But another base for the same topology is the collection of all open disks; and here the full (B2) condition is necessary.

An example of a collection of open sets that is not a base is the set formula_85 of all semi-infinite intervals of the forms formula_86 and formula_87 with formula_88. The topology generated by formula_85 contains all open intervals formula_90, hence formula_85 generates the standard topology on the real line. But formula_85 is only a subbase for the topology, not a base: a finite open interval formula_93 does not contain any element of formula_85 (equivalently, property (B2) does not hold).

==Examples==

The set of all open intervals in formula_95 forms a basis for the Euclidean topology on formula_95.

A non-empty family of subsets of a set that is closed under finite intersections of two or more sets, which is called a -system on , is necessarily a base for a topology on if and only if it covers . By definition, every σ-algebra, every filter (and so in particular, every neighborhood filter), and every topology is a covering -system and so also a base for a topology. In fact, if is a filter on then is a topology on and is a basis for it. A base for a topology does not have to be closed under finite intersections and many are not. But nevertheless, many topologies are defined by bases that are also closed under finite intersections. For example, each of the following families of subset of is closed under finite intersections and so each forms a basis for &quot;some&quot; topology on formula_95:
* The set of all bounded open intervals in formula_95 generates the usual Euclidean topology on formula_95. 
* The set of all bounded closed intervals in formula_95 generates the discrete topology on formula_95 and so the Euclidean topology is a subset of this topology. This is despite the fact that is not a subset of . Consequently, the topology generated by , which is the Euclidean topology on formula_95, is coarser than the topology generated by . In fact, it is strictly coarser because contains non-empty compact sets which are never open in the Euclidean topology. 
* The set of all intervals in such that both endpoints of the interval are rational numbers generates the same topology as . This remains true if each instance of the symbol is replaced by .
* generates a topology that is strictly coarser than the topology generated by . No element of is open in the Euclidean topology on formula_95.
* generates a topology that is strictly coarser than both the Euclidean topology and the topology generated by . The sets and are disjoint, but nevertheless is a subset of the topology generated by .

===Objects defined in terms of bases===

* The order topology on a totally ordered set admits a collection of open-interval-like sets as a base.
* In a metric space the collection of all open balls forms a base for the topology.
* The discrete topology has the collection of all singletons as a base.
* A second-countable space is one that has a countable base.

The Zariski topology on the spectrum of a ring has a base consisting of open sets that have specific useful properties. For the usual base for this topology, every finite intersection of basic open sets is a basic open set.

* The Zariski topology of formula_104 is the topology that has the algebraic sets as closed sets. It has a base formed by the set complements of algebraic hypersurfaces. 
* The Zariski topology of the spectrum of a ring (the set of the prime ideals) has a base such that each element consists of all prime ideals that do not contain a given element of the ring.

==Theorems==

* A topology formula_105 is finer than a topology formula_106 if and only if for each formula_38 and each basic open set formula_108 of formula_106 containing formula_110, there is a basic open set of formula_105 containing formula_110 and contained in formula_108.
* If formula_114 are bases for the topologies formula_115 then the collection of all set products formula_116 with each formula_117 is a base for the product topology formula_118 In the case of an infinite product, this still applies, except that all but finitely many of the base elements must be the entire space.
* Let formula_1 be a base for formula_6 and let formula_121 be a subspace of formula_6. Then if we intersect each element of formula_1 with formula_121, the resulting collection of sets is a base for the subspace formula_121.
* If a function formula_126 maps every basic open set of formula_6 into an open set of formula_121, it is an open map. Similarly, if every preimage of a basic open set of formula_121 is open in formula_6, then formula_131 is continuous.
* formula_1 is a base for a topological space formula_6 if and only if the subcollection of elements of formula_1 which contain formula_110 form a local base at formula_110, for any point formula_38.

==Base for the closed sets==

Closed sets are equally adept at describing the topology of a space. There is, therefore, a dual notion of a base for the closed sets of a topological space. Given a topological space formula_138 a family formula_139 of closed sets forms a base for the closed sets if and only if for each closed set formula_140 and each point formula_110 not in formula_140 there exists an element of formula_139 containing formula_140 but not containing formula_145
A family formula_139 is a base for the closed sets of formula_6 if and only if its in formula_138 that is the family formula_149 of complements of members of formula_139, is a base for the open sets of formula_151

Let formula_139 be a base for the closed sets of formula_151 Then
#formula_154
#For each formula_155 the union formula_156 is the intersection of some subfamily of formula_139 (that is, for any formula_158 not in formula_159 there is some formula_160 containing formula_156 and not containing formula_110).
Any collection of subsets of a set formula_6 satisfying these properties forms a base for the closed sets of a topology on formula_151 The closed sets of this topology are precisely the intersections of members of formula_165

In some cases it is more convenient to use a base for the closed sets rather than the open ones. For example, a space is completely regular if and only if the zero sets form a base for the closed sets. Given any topological space formula_138 the zero sets form the base for the closed sets of some topology on formula_151 This topology will be the finest completely regular topology on formula_6 coarser than the original one. In a similar vein, the Zariski topology on A&quot;n&quot; is defined by taking the zero sets of polynomial functions as a base for the closed sets.

==Weight and character==
We shall work with notions established in .

Fix &quot;X&quot; a topological space. Here, a network is a family formula_169 of sets, for which, for all points &quot;x&quot; and open neighbourhoods &quot;U&quot; containing &quot;x&quot;, there exists &quot;B&quot; in formula_169 for which formula_171 Note that, unlike a basis, the sets in a network need not be open.

We define the weight, &quot;w&quot;(&quot;X&quot;), as the minimum cardinality of a basis; we define the network weight, &quot;nw&quot;(&quot;X&quot;), as the minimum cardinality of a network; the character of a point, formula_172 as the minimum cardinality of a neighbourhood basis for &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;; and the character of &quot;X&quot; to be
formula_173

The point of computing the character and weight is to be able to tell what sort of bases and local bases can exist. We have the following facts:

* &quot;nw&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) ≤ &quot;w&quot;(&quot;X&quot;).
* if &quot;X&quot; is discrete, then &quot;w&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) = &quot;nw&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) = |&quot;X&quot;|.
* if &quot;X&quot; is Hausdorff, then &quot;nw&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) is finite if and only if &quot;X&quot; is finite discrete.
* if &quot;B&quot; is a basis of &quot;X&quot; then there is a basis formula_174 of size formula_175
* if &quot;N&quot; a neighbourhood basis for &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; then there is a neighbourhood basis formula_176 of size formula_177
* if formula_126 is a continuous surjection, then &quot;nw&quot;(&quot;Y&quot;) ≤ &quot;w&quot;(&quot;X&quot;). (Simply consider the &quot;Y&quot;-network formula_179 for each basis &quot;B&quot; of &quot;X&quot;.)
* if formula_9 is Hausdorff, then there exists a weaker Hausdorff topology formula_181 so that formula_182 So &quot;a fortiori&quot;, if &quot;X&quot; is also compact, then such topologies coincide and hence we have, combined with the first fact, &quot;nw&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) = &quot;w&quot;(&quot;X&quot;).
* if formula_126 a continuous surjective map from a compact metrizable space to an Hausdorff space, then &quot;Y&quot; is compact metrizable.

The last fact follows from &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) being compact Hausdorff, and hence formula_184 (since compact metrizable spaces are necessarily second countable); as well as the fact that compact Hausdorff spaces are metrizable exactly in case they are second countable. (An application of this, for instance, is that every path in a Hausdorff space is compact metrizable.)

===Increasing chains of open sets===
Using the above notation, suppose that &quot;w&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) ≤ &quot;κ&quot; some infinite cardinal. Then there does not exist a strictly increasing sequence of open sets (equivalently strictly decreasing sequence of closed sets) of length ≥ &quot;κ&quot;+.

To see this (without the axiom of choice), fix
formula_185
as a basis of open sets. And suppose &quot;per contra&quot;, that
formula_186
were a strictly increasing sequence of open sets. This means
formula_187

For
formula_188
we may use the basis to find some &quot;Uγ&quot; with &quot;x&quot; in &quot;Uγ&quot; ⊆ &quot;Vα&quot;. In this way we may well-define a map, &quot;f&quot; : &quot;κ&quot;+ → &quot;κ&quot; mapping each &quot;α&quot; to the least &quot;γ&quot; for which &quot;Uγ&quot; ⊆ &quot;Vα&quot; and meets
formula_189

This map is injective, otherwise there would be &quot;α&quot; &lt; &quot;β&quot; with &quot;f&quot;(&quot;α&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;β&quot;) = &quot;γ&quot;, which would further imply &quot;Uγ&quot; ⊆ &quot;Vα&quot; but also meets
formula_190
which is a contradiction. But this would go to show that &quot;κ&quot;+ ≤ &quot;κ&quot;, a contradiction.

<text>RealAudio, also spelled Real Audio, is a proprietary audio format developed by RealNetworks and first released in April 1995. It uses a variety of audio codecs, ranging from low-bitrate formats that can be used over dialup modems, to high-fidelity formats for music. It can be used as a streaming audio format, that is played at the same time as it is downloaded.

In the past, many internet radio stations used RealAudio to stream their programming over the internet in real time. In recent years, however, the format has become less common and has given way to more popular audio formats. RealAudio was heavily used by the BBC websites until 2009, though it was discontinued due to its declining use. BBC World Service, the last of the BBC websites to use RealAudio, discontinued its use in March 2011.

==File extensions==
RealAudio files were originally identified by a filename extension of .ra (for Real Audio). In 1997, RealNetworks also began offering a video format called RealVideo. The combination of the audio and video formats was called RealMedia and used the file extension .rm. However, the latest version of RealProducer, Real&#x27;s flagship encoder, reverted to using .ra for audio-only files, and began using .rv for video files (with or without audio), and .rmvb for VBR video files. The .ram (Real Audio Metadata) and .smil (Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language) file formats are sometimes encountered as links from web pages (see .Streaming Audio section below).

==Players==
The official player for RealMedia content is RealNetworks&#x27; RealPlayer SP, currently at version 16, and is available for various platforms in binary form. Several features of this program have proven controversial (most recently, RP11&#x27;s ability to record unprotected streaming media from web sites), and many alternative players have been developed. RealNetworks initially tried to discourage development of alternative players by keeping their audio format secret. However, in recent years, RealNetworks has made efforts to be somewhat more open, and has founded the Helix Community, a collaborative open source project, to extend their media framework.

When RealAudio was introduced, RealNetworks disclosed no technical details about the audio format or how it was encoded, but it was soon noticed that some of the audio codecs used in RealAudio were identical to those used in cellular telephones and digital television. As these formats had been described in detail in various technical papers and standards documents, it was possible to write software capable of playing RealAudio based on this information.

A variety of unofficial players now exist, including MPlayer, and Real Alternative. However, Real Alternative does not decode the audio data by itself, but relies on the dynamically linked libraries (DLLs) from the official RealPlayer. Thus Real Alternative requires RealPlayer to be installed (or at least its DLLs) in order to function. Most other players are based on FFmpeg, which has its own audio codec library. The audio codecs in ffmpeg were written based on the publicly available information about the formats, and do not use the RealPlayer or Helix software. It is also possible to obtain codecs which allow Windows Media Player to play some versions of RealAudio.

Although RealNetworks has made the Helix player available as an open source project, they have kept some of the audio codecs proprietary, and the Helix player can not play all RealAudio files.

==Streaming audio==
RealAudio was developed as a streaming media format, meaning that it can be played while it is downloaded. It is possible to stream RealAudio using HTTP. In this case, the RealAudio file is retrieved similarly to a normal web page, but playback begins as soon as the first part is received and continues while the rest of the file is downloaded. Using HTTP streaming works best with pre-recorded files so some alternative protocols have been developed which work better for live broadcasts.

The first version of RealAudio used a proprietary protocol called PNA or PNM to send streaming audio data. RealNetworks later switched to the IETF standardized Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) but they use RTSP only to manage the connection. The actual audio data is sent with their own proprietary RDT protocol, which they initially kept secret. Recently, some specifications for the RDT protocol have been made public through the Helix Community project. By around 2004 the open-source MPlayer project developed a means of playing the RDT streams.

In many cases, web pages do not link directly to a RealAudio file. Instead, they link to a .ram (Real Audio Metadata) or SMIL file. This is a small text file containing a link to the audio stream. When a user clicks on such a link, the user&#x27;s web browser downloads the .ram or .smil file and launches the user&#x27;s media player. The media player reads the PNM or RTSP URL from the file and then plays the stream.

With RealPlayer SP, it is now possible to save an audio stream to a file. Other programs, including MPlayer, RM Downloader, VLC media player, StreamBox VCR, HiDownload and Real7ime Converter can also save streams to a file.

==RealAudio: Pioneering Real-Time Music Streaming in 1998==

This section details the launch of Internet Music Net, a website credited by DJ Vinatea as one of the first, if not the very first, to offer real-time music streaming in 1998. The website utilized the then-pioneering RealAudio (.RA) technology, paving the way for a new era of online music consumption. 

The emergence of real-time music streaming in the late 1990s revolutionized online music access. In 1998, Internet Music Net became a pioneer in this domain, offering users the ability to listen to music directly through their web browsers using RealAudio technology.

The development of RealAudio by Progressive Networks in the mid-1990s enabled efficient streaming of audio content over the internet. Internet Music Net capitalized on this innovation, launching in 1998 (archived on Wayback Machine) as one of the first websites to offer real-time music streaming. While details about the specific features are limited due to the archived nature of the website, it likely offered functionalities such as artist selection and genre browsing.

Internet Music Net pioneering approach paved the way for the widespread adoption of real-time music streaming services. The concept of on-demand music access, popularized by this website, laid the groundwork for the development of future industry giants like Spotify and Pandora.

Although the ultimate fate of Internet Music Net remains unclear (e.g., did it cease operation or get acquired?), its contribution to the evolution of online music consumption remains undeniable. The website stands as a testament to the early efforts that shaped the way we experience music today.

==Codecs==
RealAudio files are compressed using several audio codecs. Each codec is identified by a four character code. Below is a list of the codecs and the version in which each was introduced:

* , : IS-54 VSELP (RealAudio 1)
* : G.728 LD-CELP (RealAudio 2)
* : Dolby AC3 (RealAudio 3)
* : Sipro Lab Telecom ACELP-NET (RealAudio 4/5)
* : G2/Cook Codec (RealAudio 6)
* : Sony ATRAC3 (RealAudio 8)
* : MPEG-4 LC-AAC (RealAudio 9)
* : MPEG-4 HE-AAC (RealAudio 10)
* : RealAudio Lossless Format (RealAudio 10)

While the newest version of RealPlayer should be able to play any RealAudio file, other programs may not support all codecs.

<text>Texaco, Inc. (&quot;The Texas Company&quot;) is an American oil brand owned and operated by Chevron Corporation. Its flagship product is its fuel &quot;Texaco with Techron&quot;. It also owned the Havoline motor oil brand. Texaco was an independent company until its refining operations merged into Chevron in 2001, at which time most of its station franchises were divested to Shell plc through its American division.

Texaco began as the &quot;Texas Fuel Company&quot;, founded in 1902 in Beaumont, Texas, by Joseph S. Cullinan, Thomas J. Donoghue, and Arnold Schlaet upon the discovery of oil at Spindletop.
The Texas Fuel Company was not set up to drill wells or to produce crude oil. To accomplish this, Cullinan organized the Producers Oil Company in 1902, as a group of investors affiliated with The Texas Fuel Company. Men such as John W. (&quot;Bet A Million&quot;) Gates invested in &quot;certificates of interest&quot; to an amount of almost ninety thousand dollars. Future restructuring would merge Producers Oil Company and The Texas Fuel Company as Texaco when the company needed additional funding, which J.W. Gates provided in the amount of approximately $590,000 in return for company stock.

Texaco was one of the Seven Sisters which dominated the global petroleum industry from the mid-1940s to the 1970s. Its current logo features a white star in a red circle (a reference to the lone star of Texas), leading to the long-running advertising jingles &quot;You can trust your car to the man who wears the star&quot; and &quot;Star of the American Road.&quot; The company was headquartered in Harrison, New York, near White Plains, prior to the merger with Chevron.

Texaco gasoline comes with Techron, an additive developed by Chevron, as of 2005, replacing the previous CleanSystem3. The Texaco brand is strong in the U.S., Latin America, and West Africa. It has a presence in Europe as well; for example, it is a well-known retail brand in the UK, with around 980 Texaco-branded service stations.

==History==
===1902–59: Beginnings===
Texaco was founded in Beaumont, Texas as the &quot;Texas Fuel Company&quot; in 1902, by Jim Hogg, Joseph S. Cullinan, John Warne Gates, and Arnold Schlaet. On 1 May 1902, the Texas Company was formed from the assets of Texas Fuel assets, and additional capitalization. In 1905, it established an operation in Antwerp, Belgium, under the name Continental Petroleum Company, which it acquired control of in 1913. In 1915, Texaco moved to new 13 story offices on 1111 Rusk St., Houston, Texas. In 1928, Texaco became the first U.S. oil company to sell its gasoline nationwide under one single brand name in all of the then 48 states.
In 1931, Texaco purchased the Indian Oil Company, based in Illinois. This expanded Texaco&#x27;s refining and marketing base in the Midwest and also gave Texaco the rights to Indian&#x27;s Havoline motor oil, which became a Texaco product. The next year, Texaco introduced Fire Chief gasoline nationwide, a so-called &quot;super-octane&quot; motor fuel touted as meeting or exceeding government standards for gasoline for fire engines and other emergency vehicles. It was promoted through a radio program over NBC hosted by Ed Wynn, called the &quot;Texaco Fire Chief&quot;.

In 1936, the Texas Corporation purchased the Barco oil concession in Colombia, and formed a joint venture with Socony-Vacuum, now Mobil, to develop it. Over the next three years the company engaged in a highly challenging project to drill wells and build a pipeline to the coast across mountains and then through uncharted swamps and jungles. During this time, Texaco also illegally supplied the fascist Nationalist faction in the Spanish Civil War with a total of oil. For these illegal sales to Francisco Franco&#x27;s fascist forces the company was fined $20,000 for violating the Neutrality Act of 1937, although it continued to sell to Franco on credit until the end of the war.

Also in 1936, marketing operations &quot;East of Suez&quot; (including Asia, East Africa, and Australasia) were placed into a joint venture with Standard Oil Company of California – Socal (now Chevron) – under the brand name Caltex, in exchange for Socal placing its Bahrain refinery and Arabian oilfields into the venture. The next year, Texaco commissioned industrial designer Walter Dorwin Teague to develop a modern service station design.
In 1938, Texaco introduced Sky Chief gasoline, a premium fuel developed from the ground up as a high-octane gasoline rather than just an ethylized regular product. In 1939, Texaco became one of the first oil companies to introduce a &quot;Registered Rest Room&quot; program to ensure that restroom facilities at all Texaco stations nationwide maintained a standard level of cleanliness to the motoring public.

After the onset of World War II in 1939, Texaco&#x27;s CEO, Torkild Rieber, admirer of Hitler, hired pro-Nazi assistants who cabled Berlin &quot;coded information about ships leaving New York for Britain and what their cargoes were.&quot; This espionage easily enabled Hitler to destroy the ships. In 1940, Rieber was forced to resign when his connections with German Nazism, and his illegal supply of oil to the fascist forces during the Spanish Civil War were made public by the &quot;Herald Tribune&quot; through information produced by British Security Coordination. Life Magazine portrayed Rieber&#x27;s resignation as unfair, advocating that he only dined with Westrick, and lent him a company car.
During the war, Texaco ranked 93rd among United States corporations in the value of military production contracts. In 1947, Caltex expanded to include Texaco&#x27;s European marketing operations. That same year, Texaco merged its British operation with Trinidad Leaseholds under the name Regent; it gained full control of Regent in 1956, but the Regent brand remained in use until 1968–9. In 1954, the company added the detergent additive Petrox to its &quot;Sky Chief&quot; gasoline, which was also souped up with higher octane to meet the antiknock needs of new cars with high-compression engines.

The next year, Texaco became the sole sponsor of The Huntley-Brinkley Report on NBC-TV. In 1959, the Texas Company changed its corporate name to Texaco, Inc. to better reflect the value of the Texaco brand name, which represented the biggest selling gasoline brand in the U.S. and only marketer selling gasoline under one brand name in all (by then) 50 states. It also acquired McColl-Frontenac Oil Company Ltd. of Canada and changes its name to Texaco Canada Limited. Around this time, Paragon Oil, a major fuel oil distribution company in the northeastern U.S., was acquired.

===1964–98: Various ventures ===
In 1964, Texaco introduced the &quot;Matawan&quot; service station design at a station in Matawan, New Jersey. Two years later, Texaco replaced the long-running banjo sign with a new hexagon logo that had previously been test-marketed with the &quot;Matawan&quot; station design introduced two years earlier. The new logo featured a red outline with TEXACO in black bold lettering and a small banjo logo with a red star and green T at bottom. The following year, the Regent name was replaced by Texaco at British petrol stations. In 1970, in response to increasingly-stringent federal vehicle emissions standards that would induce automakers to install catalytic converters requiring equipped vehicles to run on unleaded gasoline, Texaco introduced their first regular-octane no-lead gasoline at stations in the Los Angeles area and throughout Southern California. Lead-Free Texaco became available nationwide in 1974. On November 20, 1980, the Lake Peigneur/Jefferson Island disaster occurred. Two years later, a new service station design was introduced. Several product names were also changed with the advent of self-service, including Lead-free Texaco to Texaco Unleaded, Fire Chief to Texaco Regular, and Super Lead-free Sky Chief to Texaco Super Unleaded.

At the end of 1981 and the beginning of 1982, members of the Medellín Cartel (including Pablo Escobar), the Colombian military, the U.S.-based corporation Texas Petroleum, the Colombian legislature, small industrialists, and wealthy cattle ranchers came together in a series of meetings in Puerto Boyacá, and formed a paramilitary organization known as &quot;Muerte a Secuestradores&quot; (&quot;Death to Kidnappers&quot;, MAS) to defend their economic interests, and to provide protection for local elites from kidnappings and extortion. By 1983, Colombian internal affairs had registered 240 political killings by MAS death squads, mostly community leaders, elected officials, and farmers. 

On November 19, 1985, Pennzoil won a US$10.53-billion verdict against Texaco, the largest civil verdict in US history up to that date. The court case sprang from Texaco having established a signed contract to buy Getty Oil after Pennzoil entered into an unsigned—yet binding—buyout contract with Gordon Getty. In 1987, Texaco filed for bankruptcy. It was the largest in U.S. history until 2001.

In January 1989, Texaco and Saudi Aramco agreed to form a joint venture known as Star Enterprise in which Saudi Aramco would own a 50% share of Texaco&#x27;s refining and marketing operations in the eastern U.S. and Gulf Coast. In 1989, Texaco introduced System3 gasolines in all three grades of fuel, featuring the latest detergent additive technology to improve performance by reducing deposits that clog fuel injection systems. The Toronto-based Texaco Canada Incorporated subsidiary was sold to Imperial Oil with all Texaco Canada retail operations converted to Esso brand. Two years later, the company was awarded the National Medal of Arts. In 1993, several dozen tribal leaders and residents from the Ecuadoran Amazon filed a billion-dollar class-action lawsuit against Texaco, as a result of massive ecological pollution of the area and rivers around Texaco&#x27;s Ecuadorian offshore drilling sites, causing toxic contamination of approximately 30,000 residents.

In 1994, Texaco&#x27;s System3 gasolines were replaced by new CleanSystem3 gasoline, marketed with claims of improved engine performance. In 1995, Texaco merged their Danish and Norwegian downstream operations with those of Norsk Hydro under the new brand HydroTexaco. This joint venture was sold in 2007 to Norwegian retail interests as YX Energi, following the purchase of Hydro by Statoil. In 1996, Texaco paid over $170 million to settle racial discrimination lawsuits filed by Black employees at the company. It was the largest racial-discrimination lawsuit settlement in the U.S. at the time, and was particularly damaging to Texaco&#x27;s public relations when tapes were released of meetings with company executives planning to destroy incriminating evidence.

===1999–present: Chevron Corporation===

In 1999, the company formed the joint venture Equilon with Shell Oil Company, combining their Western and Midwestern U.S. refining and marketing. This gave rise to the 2006 U.S. Supreme Court antitrust case of &quot;Texaco Inc. v. Dagher&quot;, which cleared both Texaco and Shell of any antitrust liability concerning the pricing of Equilon&#x27;s gasoline. That same year, another joint venture, Motiva Enterprises, was formed with Shell Oil Company and Saudi Aramco in which the Star Enterprise operations were merged with the Eastern and Gulf Coast U.S. refining and marketing operations of Shell.
In October 2000, Chevron Corporation agreed to buy Texaco for $36 billion. The merger was completed October 9, 2001. As required by the FTC consent agreement, Texaco&#x27;s interest in the Equilon and Motiva joint ventures were sold to Shell. Shell began re-branding its Texaco stations as Shell the next year. Around 2003, due to lack of demand, Texaco closed Refineria Panamá, a refinery in Colón, Panama. In July 2004, Chevron regained non-exclusive rights to the Texaco brand name in the U.S. The following year, in August, Texaco introduced the Techron additive into its fuels in the U.S. and parts of Latin America. In 2007, Delek Benelux took over marketing activities for Chevron in Benelux, including 869 filling stations, mostly under the Texaco brand. In 2010, Chevron ended retail operations in the Mid-Atlantic US, removing its brand from 450 stations in Delaware, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, New Jersey, Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, Washington, D.C.

==Corporate headquarters==
Prior to the merger with Chevron, Texaco&#x27;s headquarters was a building in Harrison, in Westchester County, New York, near to White Plains. In 2002, Chevron Corporation sold the former Texaco Headquarters to Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley bought the building and the surrounding for $42 million.

Texaco leased 14 floors of the Chrysler Building in Midtown Manhattan, New York City in the 1930s. As part of the leasing agreement with Texaco the building opened the Cloud Club, a lunch club for executives. Texaco&#x27;s move to Westchester County in 1977 contributed to the closure of the Cloud Club in 1979.

==Sponsorships==
===Sports===

Texaco is associated with the Havoline brand of motor oil and other automotive products. It was one of the sponsors of NASCAR with many drivers, such as Davey Allison, Ernie Irvan, Dale Jarrett, Kenny Irwin Jr., Ricky Rudd, Jamie McMurray, Casey Mears, and Juan Pablo Montoya. Havoline continuously sponsored a car from the early 1980s to 2008. At the end of the 2008 season, Texaco/Havoline ended their sponsorship with NASCAR and Chip Ganassi Racing. This brought a 20-plus-year relationship with the sport to a close.

Texaco was also involved in open wheel racing, sponsoring the Texaco Grand Prix of Houston along with sponsoring drivers like Indianapolis 500 winner Mario Andretti and his son Michael.

In Formula One, Texaco sponsored the Team Lotus in 1972 and 1973, and McLaren from 1974 to 1978. The company returned to Grand Prix racing at a smaller scale in 1997, with their brands appearing on the Stewart SF01 car. Their association with the team and its successor, Jaguar Racing, continued until the end of 2001, in the same timeline they also sponsored ITV&#x27;s Formula 1 Coverage.

Texaco sponsored the Tom Walkinshaw Racing Rover Vitesse factory team at the 1985 and 1986 European Touring Car Championship (ETCC) under their Bastos brand, and the Ford Sierra RS500 factory cars entered by Eggenberger Motorsport in the 1987 World Touring Car Championship (plus the 1988 ETCC and other European-based championships). Texaco also sponsored cars in the 1987 World Rally Championship.

From 1987 to 1993, Texaco was the major sponsor (through its Australian Caltex offshoot) Colin Bond Racing in Australian touring car racing, first with the Alfa Romeo 75 in 1987, then the Ford Sierra RS500 from 1988 to 1992 and then Toyota Corollas in 1993. From 2000 until 2007, it was title sponsor of Stone Brothers Racing with Russell Ingall winning the 2005 championship. In 2016, Caltex became title sponsor of the Triple Eight Race Engineering car of Craig Lowndes, having previously been an associate sponsor of the team.

From 1984 to 1998, Texaco were the title sponsors of the main One Day International cricket tournament in England, the Texaco Trophy. It also sponsored the Texaco Cup, a football tournament for clubs of the British Isles.

===Entertainment broadcast (music or comedy/variety)===
Texaco was long associated with the Metropolitan Opera as sole sponsor of its radio broadcasts for 63 years. It was identified as well with such entertainment legends as Ed Wynn, Fred Allen and Milton Berle (many of their shows were originally sponsored by Texaco – see Texaco Star Theatre, which includes the sponsorship lyrics of the opening theme: &quot;We&#x27;re the men of Texaco, We work from Maine to Mexico...&quot;). Berle&#x27;s program was broadcast in the same time slot as Fulton J. Sheen&#x27;s religious program for a while, thus leading to Berle&#x27;s oft-quoted quip, &quot;We both have the same boss – Sky Chief!&quot;

Texaco was also the sponsor of the weekly Metropolitan Opera radio broadcasts, which air to this day since its inception in 1931.

In the 1930s, comedian Ed Wynn hosted a half hour stand-up comedy/variety show on the NBC Radio Network, billed as &quot;The Texaco Fire Chief&quot;, a reference to its regular grade gasoline. This trend continued into the late 1940s, when Wynn was replaced by Milton Berle as television becoming the dominant medium. The title was changed to the 60-minute &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot;, which was also broadcast on NBC.

In a 1983 video for their song, Cruel Summer, members of girl group Bananarama are depicted as working as mechanics at a Texaco gas station.

==Environmental issues==
From 1965 to 1993, Texaco participated in a consortium to develop the Lago Agrio oil field in Ecuador. The company was accused of extensive environmental damage from these operations, and faces legal claims from both private plaintiffs and from the government of Ecuador. The case was widely publicized by environmental activists and was the subject of &quot;Crude&quot;, a 2009 documentary film by Joe Berlinger.

In turn, Texaco&#x27;s owner Chevron claims that it was being unfairly targeted as a deep pocket defendant, when the actual responsibility lies with the government and its national oil company, Petroecuador.

Texaco allegedly decided to forgo their standard drilling practices in favor for a minor savings on the cost to produce a barrel of crude oil (approximately $3/barrel). Texaco allegedly dumped toxic wastewater directly into rivers, dumped waste into unlined pits, and created pits that were fitted with overflow pipes to nearby waterways, with pits also never being emptied after the drilling operations were concluded. In total, it is estimated that over 18 billion gallons of toxic waste were released into the Amazon Rainforest. In addition to the liquid pollution, it is alleged that workers burned off toxic natural gasses and some liquid waste, thus releasing highly toxic dioxins into the atmosphere.

==Diversification==

The NiMH chemistry used in modern hybrid vehicles was invented by ECD Ovonics founder, Stan Ovshinsky, and Dr. Masahiko Oshitani of the Yuasa Company In 1994, General Motors acquired a controlling interest in Ovonics&#x27;s battery development and manufacturing. On October 10, 2001, Texaco purchased GM&#x27;s share in GM Ovonics, and Chevron completed its acquisition of Texaco six days later. In 2003, Texaco Ovonics Battery Systems was restructured into Cobasys, a 50/50 joint venture between Chevron and Energy Conversion Devices (ECD) Ovonics.

<text>A chevron (also spelled cheveron, especially in older documents) is a V-shaped mark or symbol, often inverted. The word is usually used in reference to a kind of fret in architecture, or to a badge or insignia used in military or police uniforms to indicate rank or length of service, or in heraldry and the designs of flags (see flag terminology).

==Ancient history==
Appearing on pottery and petrographs throughout the ancient world, the chevron can be considered to be one of the oldest symbols in human history, with V-shaped markings occurring as early as the Neolithic era (6th to 5th millennia BC) as part of the Vinča symbols inventory. The Vinča culture responsible for the symbols appear to have used the chevron as part of a larger proto-writing system rather than any sort of heraldic or decorative use, and are not known to have passed the symbol on to any subsequent cultures.

Many comparatively recent examples appear from approximately 1800 BC onward, beginning as part of an archaeological recovery of pottery designs from the palace of Knossos on Crete in the modern day country of Greece. Furthermore the Nubian Kingdom of Kerma produced pottery with decorative repertoire confined to geometric designs such as chevrons.

== Heraldry ==
A chevron is one of the heraldic ordinaries, the simple geometrical figures which are the foundation of many coats of arms. A chevron is constructed by choosing a visually appealing angle such as the golden angle or any other angle the artist prefers. It can be subject to a number of modifications including inversion. When the ends are cut off in a way that looks like the splintered ends of a broken piece of wood, with an irregular zig-zag pattern, it is called éclaté. When shown as a smaller size than standard, it is a diminutive called a chevronel.

Chevrons appeared early in the history of heraldry, especially in Normandy. In Scandinavia the chevron is known as &quot;sparre&quot;; an early example appears in the arms of Armand Desmondly.

== Rank insignia ==
In Western European tradition, chevrons are used as an insignia of the ranks variously known, depending on the country, as non-commissioned officer or sub-officer ranks. This usage has become the worldwide norm, but there are many exceptions where other insignia, typically stripes but sometimes stars, are used for such ranks instead.

Many countries, such as France and Italy, use chevrons proper, or colloquially, the chevrons &quot;point up&quot;. Many others, such as most Commonwealth countries, use inverted chevrons, or colloquially, the chevrons &quot;point down.&quot;

In the United States, the Army and Marines use chevrons proper (although prior to the 20th century this was not true), while the Air Force, Navy, and Coast Guard use inverted chevrons. Arcs, known as &quot;rockers&quot;, are also added to chevrons to indicate higher rank.

English-speaking countries tend to use three chevrons for a sergeant and two for a corporal.

Canadian and Australian Forces often refer to chevrons as &quot;hooks&quot;. In the Dutch armed forces they are nicknamed &quot;banana peels&quot;.

In the British Army, Royal Marines and Royal Air Force, chevrons are worn point down to denote non-commissioned officer rank, with one for lance corporal, two for corporal, three for sergeant, and three with a crown for staff sergeant (known as colour sergeant in infantry regiments and the Royal Marines) or flight sergeant (RAF). Branch and tradition results in variations in rank titles (corporal of horse being the equivalent of sergeant in the Household Cavalry) and spellings (serjeant in The Rifles). Large chevrons are also worn on the sleeves of Royal Navy sailors to denote good conduct rather than rank.

Although usually associated with non-commissioned officers, the chevron was originally used as an insignia to denote general officer ranks in the British Army. It was adopted from the insignia worn by cavalry during the 18th century, in particular the Household Cavalry. It was worn on the cuffs, forearms and tails of their coats, embroidered in gold bullion for the guards and silver for dragoons regiments. George III favoured the uniform of the Horse Guards, and his Windsor uniform followed a similar pattern. After 1768, a similar pattern uniform as worn the King was introduced to general officers, with the number and spacing of the chevrons denoting rank. For example, a major general would wear his chevrons in pairs: two on the sleeves, and two on the tails. A lieutenant general would wear them in groups of three, and a full general&#x27;s would be equidistant. This practice continued into the early Victorian era.

=== Examples ===
== Vexillology ==
In vexillology, a chevron is a triangle on the hoist of a flag. The chevron is used in several national flags, such as the flag of Cuba, the flag of the Czech Republic, the flag of Jordan, the flag of Equatorial Guinea and the flag of the Philippines.

== Other uses as insignia ==


In some armies, small chevrons are worn on the lower left sleeve to indicate length of service, akin to service stripes in the U.S. military. The Israel Defense Forces use chevrons in various orientations as organizational designators on their vehicles, specifically which company within a battalion they belong to.

NATO armed forces use the &quot;Λ&quot; chevron as insignia to represent the alliance between different armies, during peacekeeping missions.

The US-led coalition that took part in Operation Desert Storm used a black &quot;Λ&quot; chevron in a similar manner as NATO forces use it on their ground vehicles. The design was created by a soldier from the 3rd Armored Division after the US military sought markings to identify coalition vehicles due to increased fratricide incidents. Its symbolism, according to the artist SGT Grzywa, was meant to be a V for Victory, a tribute to WWII Coalition Forces.

&quot;V&quot; chevrons were historically used as the insignia of the Russian Volunteer Army during the Russian Civil War, and in modern times as one of the military insignia by Russian forces during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, and Russian civilians have used it in support of their government.

French car maker Citroën uses a double chevron as its logo.

Chevrons on their side are also used as road signs to denote bends.

From the early 1950s until the early 2000s, Simplex, Faraday and many other companies manufactured the chevron series fire alarm manual pull station. The handle was shaped in a way where the handle looked like an inverted chevron.

In general, an exception breaks the normal flow of execution and executes a pre-registered &quot;exception handler&quot;; the details of how this is done depend on whether it is a hardware or software exception and how the software exception is implemented. 

Exceptions are defined by different layers of a computer system, and the typical layers are CPU-defined interrupts, operating system (OS)-defined signals, programming language-defined exceptions. Each layer requires different ways of exception handling although they may be interrelated, e.g. a CPU interrupt could be turned into an OS signal. Some exceptions, especially hardware ones, may be handled so gracefully that execution can resume where it was interrupted.

== Definition ==
The definition of an exception is based on the observation that each procedure has a precondition, a set of circumstances for which it will terminate &quot;normally&quot;. An exception handling mechanism allows the procedure to &quot;raise an exception&quot; if this precondition is violated, for example if the procedure has been called on an abnormal set of arguments. The exception handling mechanism then &quot;handles&quot; the exception.

The precondition, and the definition of exception, is subjective. The set of &quot;normal&quot; circumstances is defined entirely by the programmer, e.g. the programmer may deem division by zero to be undefined, hence an exception, or devise some behavior such as returning zero or a special &quot;ZERO DIVIDE&quot; value (circumventing the need for exceptions). Common exceptions include an invalid argument (e.g. value is outside of the domain of a function), an unavailable resource (like a missing file, a network drive error, or out-of-memory errors), or that the routine has detected a normal condition that requires special handling, e.g., attention, end of file. Social pressure is a major influence on the scope of exceptions and use of exception-handling mechanisms, i.e. &quot;examples of use, typically found in core libraries, and code examples in technical books, magazine articles, and online discussion forums, and in an organization’s code standards&quot;.

Exception handling solves the semipredicate problem, in that the mechanism distinguishes normal return values from erroneous ones. In languages without built-in exception handling such as C, routines would need to signal the error in some other way, such as the common return code and errno pattern. Taking a broad view, errors can be considered to be a proper subset of exceptions, and explicit error mechanisms such as errno can be considered (verbose) forms of exception handling. The term &quot;exception&quot; is preferred to &quot;error&quot; because it does not imply that anything is wrong - a condition viewed as an error by one procedure or programmer may not be viewed that way by another.

The term &quot;exception&quot; may be misleading because its connotation of &quot;anomaly&quot; indicates that raising an exception is abnormal or unusual, when in fact raising the exception may be a normal and usual situation in the program. For example, suppose a lookup function for an associative array throws an exception if the key has no value associated. Depending on context, this &quot;key absent&quot; exception may occur much more often than a successful lookup.

== History ==
The first hardware exception handling was found in the UNIVAC I from 1951. 
Arithmetic overflow executed two instructions at address 0 which could transfer control or fix up the result.
Software exception handling developed in the 1960s and 1970s. Exception handling was subsequently widely adopted by many programming languages from the 1980s onward.

== Hardware exceptions ==

There is no clear consensus as to the exact meaning of an exception with respect to hardware. From the implementation point of view, it is handled identically to an interrupt: the processor halts execution of the current program, looks up the interrupt handler in the interrupt vector table for that exception or interrupt condition, saves state, and switches control.

== IEEE 754 floating-point exceptions ==
Exception handling in the IEEE 754 floating-point standard refers in general to exceptional conditions and defines an exception as &quot;an event that occurs when an operation on some particular operands has no outcome suitable for every reasonable application. That operation might signal one or more exceptions by invoking the default or, if explicitly requested, a language-defined alternate handling.&quot;

By default, an IEEE 754 exception is resumable and is handled by substituting a predefined value for different exceptions, e.g. infinity for a divide by zero exception, and providing status flags for later checking of whether the exception occurred (see C99 programming language for a typical example of handling of IEEE 754 exceptions). An exception-handling style enabled by the use of status flags involves: first computing an expression using a fast, direct implementation; checking whether it failed by testing status flags; and then, if necessary, calling a slower, more numerically robust, implementation.

The IEEE 754 standard uses the term &quot;trapping&quot; to refer to the calling of a user-supplied exception-handling routine on exceptional conditions, and is an optional feature of the standard. The standard recommends several usage scenarios for this, including the implementation of non-default pre-substitution of a value followed by resumption, to concisely handle removable singularities.

The default IEEE 754 exception handling behaviour of resumption following pre-substitution of a default value avoids the risks inherent in changing flow of program control on numerical exceptions. For example, the 1996 Cluster spacecraft launch ended in a catastrophic explosion due in part to the Ada exception handling policy of aborting computation on arithmetic error. William Kahan claims the default IEEE 754 exception handling behavior would have prevented this.

== In programming languages ==
== In user interfaces ==

Front-end web development frameworks, such as React and Vue, have introduced error handling mechanisms where errors propagate up the user interface (UI) component hierarchy, in a way that is analogous to how errors propagate up the call stack in executing code. Here the error boundary mechanism serves as an analogue to the typical try-catch mechanism. Thus a component can ensure that errors from its child components are caught and handled, and not propagated up to parent components.

For example, in Vue, a component would catch errors by implementing codice_1
Vue.component(&#x27;parent&#x27;, {
 template: &#x27;&lt;div&gt;&lt;slot&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#x27;,
 errorCaptured: (err, vm, info) =&gt; alert(&#x27;An error occurred&#x27;);
Vue.component(&#x27;child&#x27;, {
 template: &#x27;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&#x27;
When used like this in markup:
&lt;parent&gt;
 &lt;child&gt;&lt;/child&gt;
&lt;/parent&gt;
The error produced by the child component is caught and handled by the parent component.

<text>Set (; Egyptological: &quot;Sutekh - swtẖ ~ stẖ&quot; or: Seth ) is a god of deserts, storms, disorder, violence, and foreigners in ancient Egyptian religion. In Ancient Greek, the god&#x27;s name is given as (). Set had a positive role where he accompanied Ra on his barque to repel Apep (Apophis), the serpent of Chaos. Set had a vital role as a reconciled combatant. He was lord of the Red Land (desert), where he was the balance to Horus&#x27; role as lord of the Black Land (fertile land).

In the Osiris myth, the most important Egyptian myth, Set is portrayed as the usurper who murdered and mutilated his own brother, Osiris. Osiris&#x27;s sister-wife, Isis, reassembled his corpse and resurrected her dead brother-husband with the help of the goddess Nephthys. The resurrection lasted long enough to conceive his son and heir, Horus. Horus sought revenge upon Set, and many of the ancient Egyptian myths describe their conflicts.

== Family ==

Set is the son of Geb, the Earth, and Nut, the Sky; his siblings are Osiris, Isis, and Nephthys. He married Nephthys and had had relationships with the foreign goddesses Anat and Astarte in some accounts. Though it has commonly been assumed that Set was married to Nephthys and therefore must have been considered the father of Anubis, some Egyptologists, such as Herman te Velde, have heavily doubted whether Set was ever regarded as Anubis&#x27;s father in ancient Egyptian religion. From these relationships is said to be born a crocodile deity called Maga.

==Name origin==
The meaning of the name &quot;Set&quot; is unknown, but it is thought to have been originally pronounced *&quot;sūtiẖ&quot; [ˈsuw.tixʲ] based on spellings of his name in Egyptian hieroglyphs as &quot;stẖ&quot; and &quot;swtẖ&quot;. The Late Egyptian spelling &quot;stš&quot; reflects the palatalization of &quot;ẖ&quot; while the eventual loss of the final consonant is recorded in spellings like &quot;swtj.&quot; The Coptic form of the name, &quot;Sēt,&quot; is the basis for the English vocalization.

==Set animal==
In art, Set is usually depicted as an enigmatic creature referred to by Egyptologists as the &quot;Set animal&quot;, a beast not identified with any known animal, although it could be seen as resembling a Saluki, an aardvark, an African wild dog, a donkey, a hyena, a jackal, a pig, an antelope, a giraffe, or a fennec fox. The animal has a downward curving snout; long ears with squared-off ends; a thin, forked tail with sprouted fur tufts in an inverted arrow shape; and a slender canine body. Sometimes, Set is depicted as a human with the distinctive head. Some early Egyptologists proposed that it was a stylised representation of the giraffe, owing to the large flat-topped &quot;horns&quot; which correspond to a giraffe&#x27;s ossicones. The Egyptians themselves, however, used distinct depictions for the giraffe and the Set animal. During the Late Period, Set is usually depicted as a donkey or as a man with the head of a donkey, and in the &quot;Book of the Faiyum&quot;, Set is depicted with a flamingo head.

The earliest representations of what might be the Set animal comes from a tomb dating to the Amratian culture (&quot;Naqada I&quot;) of prehistoric Egypt (3790–3500 BCE), although this identification is uncertain. If these are ruled out, then the earliest Set animal appears on a ceremonial macehead of Scorpion II, a ruler of the Naqada III phase. The head and the forked tail of the Set animal are clearly present on the mace.

==Conflict of Horus and Set==

An important element of Set&#x27;s mythology was his conflict with his brother or nephew, Horus, for the throne of Egypt. The contest between them is often violent but is also described as a legal judgment before the Ennead, an assembled group of Egyptian deities, to decide who should inherit the kingship. The judge in this trial may be Geb, who, as the father of Osiris and Set, held the throne before they did, or it may be the creator gods Ra or Atum, the originators of kingship. Other deities also take important roles: Thoth frequently acts as a conciliator in the dispute or as an assistant to the divine judge, and in &quot;Contendings&quot;, Isis uses her cunning and magical power to aid her son.

The rivalry of Horus and Set is portrayed in two contrasting ways. Both perspectives appear as early as the &quot;Pyramid Texts&quot;, the earliest source of the myth. In some spells from these texts, Horus is the son of Osiris and nephew of Set, and the murder of Osiris is the major impetus for the conflict. The other tradition depicts Horus and Set as brothers. This incongruity persists in many of the subsequent sources, where the two gods may be called brothers or uncle and nephew at different points in the same text.

The divine struggle involves many episodes. &quot;Contendings&quot; describes the two gods appealing to various other deities to arbitrate the dispute and competing in different types of contests, such as racing in boats or fighting each other in the form of hippopotami, to determine a victor. In this account, Horus repeatedly defeats Set and is supported by most of the other deities. Yet the dispute drags on for eighty years, largely because the judge, the creator god, favors Set. In late ritual texts, the conflict is characterized as a great battle involving the two deities&#x27; assembled followers. The strife in the divine realm extends beyond the two combatants. At one point Isis attempts to harpoon Set as he is locked in combat with her son, but she strikes Horus instead, who then cuts off her head in a fit of rage. Thoth replaces Isis&#x27;s head with that of a cow; the story gives a mythical origin for the cow-horn headdress that Isis commonly wears.

In a key episode in the conflict, Set sexually abuses Horus. Set&#x27;s violation is partly meant to degrade his rival, but it also involves homosexual desire, in keeping with one of Set&#x27;s major characteristics, his forceful, potent, and indiscriminate sexuality. In the earliest account of this episode, in a fragmentary Middle Kingdom papyrus, the sexual encounter begins when Set asks to have sex with Horus, who agrees on the condition that Set will give Horus some of his strength. The encounter puts Horus in danger, because in Egyptian tradition semen is a potent and dangerous substance, akin to poison. According to some texts, Set&#x27;s semen enters Horus&#x27;s body and makes him ill, but in &quot;Contendings&quot;, Horus thwarts Set by catching Set&#x27;s semen in his hands. Isis retaliates by putting Horus&#x27;s semen on lettuce-leaves that Set eats. Set&#x27;s defeat becomes apparent when this semen appears on his forehead as a golden disk. He has been impregnated with his rival&#x27;s seed and as a result &quot;gives birth&quot; to the disk. In &quot;Contendings&quot;, Thoth takes the disk and places it on his own head; in earlier accounts, it is Thoth who is produced by this anomalous birth.

Another important episode concerns mutilations that the combatants inflict upon each other: Horus injures or steals Set&#x27;s testicles and Set damages or tears out one, or occasionally both, of Horus&#x27;s eyes. Sometimes the eye is torn into pieces. Set&#x27;s mutilation signifies a loss of virility and strength. The removal of Horus&#x27;s eye is even more important, for this stolen eye of Horus represents a wide variety of concepts in Egyptian religion. One of Horus&#x27;s major roles is as a sky deity, and for this reason his right eye was said to be the sun and his left eye the moon. The theft or destruction of the eye of Horus is therefore equated with the darkening of the moon in the course of its cycle of phases, or during eclipses. Horus may take back his lost Eye, or other deities, including Isis, Thoth, and Hathor, may retrieve or heal it for him. Egyptologist Herman te Velde argues that the tradition about the lost testicles is a late variation on Set&#x27;s loss of semen to Horus, and that the moon-like disk that emerges from Set&#x27;s head after his impregnation is the Eye of Horus. If so, the episodes of mutilation and sexual abuse would form a single story, in which Set assaults Horus and loses semen to him, Horus retaliates and impregnates Set, and Set comes into possession of Horus&#x27;s eye, when it appears on Set&#x27;s head. Because Thoth is a moon deity in addition to his other functions, it would make sense, according to te Velde, for Thoth to emerge in the form of the Eye and step in to mediate between the feuding deities.

In any case, the restoration of the eye of Horus to wholeness represents the return of the moon to full brightness, the return of the kingship to Horus, and many other aspects of &quot;ma&#x27;at&quot;. Sometimes the restoration of Horus&#x27;s eye is accompanied by the restoration of Set&#x27;s testicles, so that both gods are made whole near the conclusion of their feud.

==Protector of Ra==

Set was depicted standing on the prow of Ra&#x27;s barge defeating the dark serpent Apep. In some Late Period representations, such as in the Persian Period Temple of Hibis at Khargah, Set was represented in this role with a falcon&#x27;s head, taking on the guise of Horus. In the &quot;Amduat&quot;, Set is described as having a key role in overcoming Apep.

==Set in the Second Intermediate, Ramesside and later periods==
During the Second Intermediate Period (1650–1550 BCE), a group of Near Eastern peoples, known as the &quot;Hyksos&quot; (literally, &quot;rulers of foreign lands&quot;) gained control of Lower Egypt, and ruled the Nile Delta, from Avaris. They chose Set, originally Upper Egypt&#x27;s chief god, the god of foreigners and the god they found most similar to their own chief god, Hadad, as their patron. Set then became worshiped as the chief god once again. The Hyksos King Apophis is recorded as worshiping Set exclusively, as described in the following passage:
Jan Assmann argues that because the ancient Egyptians could never conceive of a &quot;lonely&quot; god lacking personality, Seth the desert god, who was worshiped on his own, represented a manifestation of evil.

When Ahmose I overthrew the Hyksos and expelled them, in , Egyptians&#x27; attitudes towards Asiatic foreigners became xenophobic, and royal propaganda discredited the period of Hyksos rule. The Set cult at Avaris flourished, nevertheless, and the Egyptian garrison of Ahmose stationed there became part of the priesthood of Set.

The founder of the Nineteenth Dynasty, Ramesses I came from a military family from Avaris with strong ties to the priesthood of Set. Several of the Ramesside kings were named after the god, most notably Seti I (literally, &quot;man of Set&quot;) and Setnakht (literally, &quot;Set is strong&quot;). In addition, one of the garrisons of Ramesses II held Set as its patron deity, and Ramesses II erected the so-called &quot;Year 400 Stela&quot; at Pi-Ramesses, commemorating the 400th anniversary of the Set cult in the Nile delta.

In ancient Egyptian astronomy, Set was commonly associated with the planet Mercury.

Set also became associated with foreign gods during the New Kingdom, particularly in the delta. Set was identified by the Egyptians with the Hittite deity Teshub, who, like Set, was a storm god, and the Canaanite deity Baal, being worshipped together as &quot;Seth-Baal&quot;.

Additionally, Set is depicted in part of the Greek Magical Papyri, a body of texts forming a grimoire used in Greco-Roman magic during the fourth century CE.

==The demonization of Set==
According to Herman te Velde, the demonization of Set took place after Egypt&#x27;s conquest by several foreign nations in the Third Intermediate and Late Periods. Set, who had traditionally been the god of foreigners, thus also became associated with foreign oppressors, including the Kushite and Persian empires. It was during this time that Set was particularly vilified, and his defeat by Horus widely celebrated.

Set&#x27;s negative aspects were emphasized during this period. Set was the killer of Osiris, having hacked Osiris&#x27; body into pieces and dispersed it so that he could not be resurrected. The Greeks would later associate Set with Typhon and Yahweh, a monstrous and evil force of raging nature (being the three of them depicted as donkey-like creatures, classifying their worshippers as onolatrists).

Set and Typhon also had in common that both were sons of deities representing the Earth (Gaia and Geb) who attacked the principal deities (Osiris for Set, Zeus for Typhon). Nevertheless, throughout this period, in some outlying regions of Egypt, Set was still regarded as the heroic chief deity.

Ancient Egyptologist Dr. Kara Cooney shot an episode called &quot;The Birth of the Devil&quot; in the &quot;Out of Egypt&quot; documentary series. In this documentary, the scientist describes the process of demonization of Set and the positioning of the it as absolute evil on the opposite side, in parallel with the transition to monotheism in different regions from Rome to India, where God began to be perceived as the representative of absolute goodness.

==Set temples==

Set was worshipped at the temples of Ombos (Nubt near Naqada) and Ombos (Nubt near Kom Ombo), at Oxyrhynchus in Middle Egypt, and also in part of the Fayyum area.

More specifically, Set was worshipped in the relatively large metropolitan (yet provincial) locale of Sepermeru, especially during the Ramesside Period. There, Seth was honored with an important temple called the &quot;House of Seth, Lord of Sepermeru&quot;. One of the epithets of this town was &quot;gateway to the desert&quot;, which fits well with Set&#x27;s role as a deity of the frontier regions of ancient Egypt. At Sepermeru, Set&#x27;s temple enclosure included a small secondary shrine called &quot;The House of Seth, Powerful-Is-His-Mighty-Arm&quot;, and Ramesses II himself built (or modified) a second land-owning temple for Nephthys, called &quot;The House of Nephthys of Ramesses-Meriamun&quot;.

The two temples of Seth and Nephthys in Sepermeru were under separate administration, each with its own holdings and prophets. Moreover, another moderately sized temple of Seth is noted for the nearby town of Pi-Wayna. The close association of Seth temples with temples of Nephthys in key outskirt-towns of this &quot;milieu&quot; is also reflected in the likelihood that there existed another &quot;House of Seth&quot; and another &quot;House of Nephthys&quot; in the town of Su, at the entrance to the Fayyum.

Papyrus Bologna preserves a most irritable complaint lodged by one Pra&#x27;em-hab, Prophet of the &quot;House of Seth&quot; in the now-lost town of Punodjem (&quot;The Sweet Place&quot;). In the text of Papyrus Bologna, the harried Pra&#x27;em-hab laments undue taxation for his own temple (The House of Seth) and goes on to lament that he is also saddled with responsibility for: &quot;The ship, and I am likewise also responsible for the House of Nephthys, along with the remaining heap of district temples&quot;.

Nothing is known about the particular theologies of the closely connected Set and Nephthys temples in these districts — for example, the religious tone of temples of Nephthys located in such proximity to those of Seth, especially given the seemingly contrary Osirian loyalties of Seth&#x27;s consort-goddess. When, by the Twentieth Dynasty, the &quot;demonization&quot; of Seth was ostensibly inaugurated, Seth was either eradicated or increasingly pushed to the outskirts, Nephthys flourished as part of the usual Osirian pantheon throughout Egypt, even obtaining a Late Period status as tutelary goddess of her own Nome (UU Nome VII, &quot;Hwt-Sekhem&quot;/Diospolis Parva) and as the chief goddess of the Mansion of the Sistrum in that district.

Seth&#x27;s cult persisted even into the latter days of ancient Egyptian religion, in outlying but important places like Kharga, Dakhlah, Deir el-Hagar, Mut, and Kellis. In these places, Seth was considered &quot;Lord of the Oasis / Town&quot; and Nephthys was likewise venerated as &quot;Mistress of the Oasis&quot; at Seth&#x27;s side, in his temples (esp. the dedication of a Nephthys-cult statue). Meanwhile, Nephthys was also venerated as &quot;Mistress&quot; in the Osirian temples of these districts as part of the specifically Osirian college. It would appear that the ancient Egyptians in these locales had little problem with the paradoxical dualities inherent in venerating Seth and Nephthys, as juxtaposed against Osiris, Isis, and Nephthys.

==In modern religion==
Set, in modern religious contexts, is recognized primarily through Kemetism and the Temple of Set. Kemetism, a modern revival of ancient Egyptian religion, acknowledges Set as a complex deity associated with chaos, storms, and warfare, yet also protector against the serpent Apep. The Temple of Set, founded in 1975, venerates Set as a figure of isolation and self-deification, emphasizing personal enlightenment and the exploration of the left-hand path.

==In popular culture==

In the television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, Set (using the name Sutekh and portrayed by Gabriel Woolf) is depicted as an alien entity bent on destroying all life. He first appears in the 1975 serial &quot;Pyramids of Mars&quot;, where he schemes to escape an Egyptian pyramid he has been imprisoned in millennia ago by Horus. Sutekh returned after nearly 50 years in the 2024 Series 14 two-part finale &quot;The Legend of Ruby Sunday&quot; / &quot;Empire of Death&quot; as the God of Death in the Pantheon.

In the role-playing game &quot;&quot;, the ancient Egyptian deity Set is depicted as an antediluvian vampire, believed to be one of the oldest undead beings. Revered as the founder of the enigmatic Followers of Set (now known as The Ministry in the game&#x27;s fifth edition). Imprisoned in torpor, Set remains a focal point for his followers who strive to rouse him from his slumber. He commands powers entwined with manipulation, darkness, and serpentine subtlety, epitomized by his unique Discipline, Serpentis, dedicated to the mastery of serpents.

Seth appears in the fourth game of the Tomb Raider series, &quot;Tomb Raider The Last Revelation,&quot; acting as the story&#x27;s main background villain. In the game, Seth was imprisoned by Horus on a unfound tomb at the Valley of the Kings thousands of years ago, only to be accidentally awakened from his eternal slumber by &quot;Lara Croft&quot; after she removes an artifact called the Amulet of Horus from Seth&#x27;s tomb, releasing him once again upon the world, forcing Lara on a race against time to find a way to imprison Seth once more and avert Armageddon.

In the 1992 Nintendo Entertainment System video game &quot;Nightshade&quot;, the villain&#x27;s public persona is that of &quot;Sutekh&quot;, a criminal underboss who unifies the gangs of the fictitious Metro City. In line with the idea of Sutekh, of Egyptian mythology, the Sutekh in the video game reigns supreme over all of the violence in the city. Of particular note, in Egyptian mythology, Sutekh is also the god of foreigners. In the Nightshade video game, its villain is not of Egyptian descent, but instead a man by the name of Waldo P. Schmeer who is a historian obsessed with Egyptian lore. Set is also a minor villain in other video games, including &quot;Killing Time&quot; (1995, 1996) and &quot;PowerSlave&quot; (1996).

Sutekh is an antagonist in some films and other material in the &quot;Puppet Master&quot; universe. Sutekh is portrayed as the other worldly owner of the secret of life, which animates the eponymous puppets, and stalks anyone who steals it.

Ahead of the release of their 25th studio album, &quot;The Silver Cord&quot;, Australian band King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard released the album&#x27;s first three songs. The third of these, titled &quot;Set&quot;, describes Set killing Osiris and his subsequent conflict with Horus.

<text>Entomology () is the branch of zoology that focuses on insects. Those who study entomology are known as entomologists. In the past, the term &quot;insect&quot; was less specific, and historically the definition of entomology would also include the study of animals in other arthropod groups, such as arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans. The field is also referred to as insectology in American English, while in British English insectology implies the study of the relationships between insects and humans.

Over 1.3million insect species have been described by entomology.

==History==


Entomology is rooted in nearly all human cultures from prehistoric times, primarily in the context of agriculture (especially biological control and beekeeping). The natural Roman philosopher Pliny the Elder (23–79 CE) wrote a book on the kinds of insects, while the scientist of Kufa, Ibn al-A&#x27;rābī (760–845 CE) wrote a book on flies, (). However scientific study in the modern sense began only relatively recently, in the 16th century. Ulisse Aldrovandi&#x27;s (Concerning Insect Animals) was published in 1602. Microscopist Jan Swammerdam published &quot;History of Insects&quot;, correctly describing the reproductive organs of insects and metamorphosis. In 1705, Maria Sibylla Merian published the book about the tropical insects of Dutch Surinam.

Early entomological works associated with the naming and classification of species followed the practice of maintaining cabinets of curiosity, predominantly in Europe. This collecting fashion led to the formation of natural history societies, exhibitions of private collections, and journals for recording communications and the documentation of new species. Many of the collectors tended to be from the aristocracy, and there developed a trade involving collectors around the world and traders. This has been called the &quot;era of heroic entomology&quot;. William Kirby is widely considered as the father of entomology in England. In collaboration with William Spence, he published a definitive entomological encyclopedia, &quot;Introduction to Entomology&quot;, regarded as the subject&#x27;s foundational text. He also helped found the Royal Entomological Society in London in 1833, one of the earliest such societies in the world; earlier antecedents, such as the Aurelian society date back to the 1740s. In the late 19th century, the growth of agriculture, and colonial trade spawned the &quot;era of economic entomology&quot; which created the professional entomologist associated with the rise of the university and training in the field of biology.

Entomology developed rapidly in the 19th and 20th centuries and was studied by large numbers of people, including such notable figures as Charles Darwin, Jean-Henri Fabre, Vladimir Nabokov, Karl von Frisch (winner of the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine), and twice Pulitzer Prize winner E. O. Wilson.

There has also been a history of people becoming entomologists through museum curation and research assistance, such as Sophie Lutterlough at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. Insect identification is an increasingly common hobby, with butterflies and (to a lesser extent) dragonflies being the most popular.

Most insects can easily be allocated to order, such as Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, and ants) or Coleoptera (beetles). However, identifying to genus or species is usually only possible through the use of identification keys and monographs. Because the class Insecta contains a very large number of species (over 330,000 species of beetles alone) and the characteristics distinguishing them are unfamiliar, and often subtle (or invisible without a microscope), this is often very difficult even for a specialist. This has led to the development of automated species identification systems targeted on insects, for example, Daisy, ABIS, SPIDA and Draw-wing.

==Applications==

===Pest control===

In 1994, the Entomological Society of America launched a new professional certification program for the pest control industry called the Associate Certified Entomologist (ACE). To qualify as a &quot;true entomologist&quot; an individual would normally require an advanced degree, with most entomologists pursuing a PhD. While not true entomologists in the traditional sense, individuals who attain the ACE certification may be referred to as ACEs or Associate Certified Entomologists.

As such, other credential programs managed by the Entomological Society of America have varying credential requirements. These different programs are known as Public Health Entomology (PHE), Certified IPM Technicians (CITs), and Board Certified Entomologists (BCEs) (ESA Certification Corporation). To be qualified in public health entomology (PHE), one must pass an exam on the types of arthropods that can spread diseases and lead to medical complications (ESA Certification Corporation). These individuals also have to &quot;agree to ascribe to a code of ethical behavior&quot; (ESA Certification Corporation). Individuals who are planning to become Certified IPM Technicians (CITs), need to obtain at around 1-4 years of experience in pest management and successfully pass an exam, that is based on the information, that they are acquainted with (ESA Certification Corporation). Like in Public Health Entomology (PHE), those who want to become Certified IPM Technicians (CITs) also have to &quot;agree to ascribe to a code of ethical behavior&quot; (ESA Certification Corporation). These individuals must also be approved to use pesticides (ESA Certification Corporation). For those who plan on becoming Board Certified Entomologists (BCEs), individuals have to pass two exams and &quot;agree to ascribe to a code of ethical behavior&quot; (ESA Certification Corporation). As with this, they also have to fulfill a certain amount of educational requirements every 12 months (ESA Certification Corporation).

===Forensics===

Forensic entomology is a branch of forensic science that studies insects found on corpses or elsewhere around crime scenes. This includes studying the types of insects commonly found on cadavers, their life cycles, their presence in different environments, and how insect assemblages change with decomposition.

===Medicine===

Medical entomology is focused upon insects and arthropods that impact human health. Veterinary entomology is included in this category, because many animal diseases can &quot;jump species&quot; and become a human health threat, for example, bovine encephalitis. Medical entomology also includes scientific research on the behavior, ecology, and epidemiology of arthropod disease vectors, and involves a tremendous outreach to the public, including local and state officials and other stake holders in the interest of public safety.

==Subdisciplines==

Many entomologists specialize in a single order or even a family of insects, and a number of these subspecialties are given their own generic names, typically (but not always) derived from the scientific name of the group:

* Coleopterology – beetles
* Dipterology – flies
* Odonatology – dragonflies and damselflies
* Hemipterology – true bugs
* Isopterology – termites
* Lepidopterology – moths and butterflies
* Melittology (or &quot;Apiology&quot;) – bees
* Myrmecology – ants

<doc id="59243" wikidata="Q17159" url="?curid=59243" title="Amphibole">
<text>Amphibole ( ) is a group of inosilicate minerals, forming prism or needlelike crystals, composed of double chain tetrahedra, linked at the vertices and generally containing ions of iron and/or magnesium in their structures. Its IMA symbol is Amp. Amphiboles can be green, black, colorless, white, yellow, blue, or brown. The International Mineralogical Association currently classifies amphiboles as a mineral supergroup, within which are two groups and several subgroups.

==Mineralogy==

Amphiboles crystallize into two crystal systems, monoclinic and orthorhombic. In chemical composition and general characteristics they are similar to the pyroxenes. The chief differences from pyroxenes are that (i) amphiboles contain essential hydroxyl (OH) or halogen (F, Cl) and (ii) the basic structure is a double chain of tetrahedra (as opposed to the single chain structure of pyroxene). Most apparent, in hand specimens, is that amphiboles form oblique cleavage planes (at around 120 degrees), whereas pyroxenes have cleavage angles of approximately 90 degrees. Amphiboles are also specifically less dense than the corresponding pyroxenes. Amphiboles are the primary constituent of amphibolites.

===Structure===
Like pyroxenes, amphiboles are classified as inosilicate (chain silicate) minerals. However, the pyroxene structure is built around single chains of silica tetrahedra while amphiboles are built around double chains of silica tetrahedra. In other words, as with almost all silicate minerals, each silicon ion is surrounded by four oxygen ions. In amphiboles, some of the oxygen ions are shared between silicon ions to form a double chain structure as depicted below. These chains extend along the [001] axis of the crystal. One side of each chain has &quot;apical&quot; oxygen ions, shared by only one silicon ion, and pairs of double chains are bound to each other by metal ions that connect apical oxygen ions. The pairs of double chains have been likened to I-beams. Each I-beam is bonded to its neighbor by additional metal ions to form the complete crystal structure. Large gaps in the structure may be empty or partially filled by large metal ions, such as sodium, but remain points of weakness that help define the cleavage planes of the crystal.
===In rocks===

Amphiboles are minerals of either igneous or metamorphic origin. Amphiboles are more common in intermediate to felsic igneous rocks than in mafic igneous rocks, because the higher silica and dissolved water content of the more evolved magmas favors formation of amphiboles rather than pyroxenes. The highest amphibole content, around 20%, is found in andesites. Hornblende is widespread in igneous and metamorphic rocks and is particularly common in syenites and diorites. Calcium is sometimes a constituent of naturally occurring amphiboles. Amphiboles of metamorphic origin include those developed in limestones by contact metamorphism (tremolite) and those formed by the alteration of other ferromagnesian minerals (such as hornblende as an alteration product of pyroxene). Pseudomorphs of amphibole after pyroxene are known as uralite.

==History and etymology==
The name &quot;amphibole&quot; derives from Greek (, ), implying ambiguity. The name was used by to include tremolite, actinolite and hornblende. The group was so named by Haüy in allusion to the protean variety, in composition and appearance, assumed by its minerals. This term has since been applied to the whole group. Numerous sub-species and varieties are distinguished, the more important of which are tabulated below in two series. The formulae of each will be seen to be built on the general double-chain silicate formula RSi4O11.

Four of the amphibole minerals are commonly called asbestos. These are: anthophyllite, riebeckite, the cummingtonite/grunerite series, and the actinolite/tremolite series. The cummingtonite/grunerite series is often termed amosite or &quot;brown asbestos&quot;, and riebeckite is known as crocidolite or &quot;blue asbestos&quot;. These are generally called amphibole asbestos. Mining, manufacture and prolonged use of these minerals can cause serious illnesses.

==Mineral species==
The more common amphiboles are classified as shown in the following table:
===Other species===
Orthorhombic series
* Holmquistite, Li2Mg3Al2Si8O22(OH)2
Monoclinic series
* Pargasite, NaCa2Mg3Fe2+Si6Al3O22(OH)2
* Winchite, (CaNa)Mg4(Al,Fe3+)Si8O22(OH)2
* Edenite, NaCa2Mg5(Si7Al)O22(OH)2

===Series===
Certain amphibole minerals form solid solution series, at least at elevated temperature. Ferrous iron usually substitutes freely for magnesium in amphiboles to form continuous solid solution series between magnesium-rich and iron-rich endmembers. These include the cummington (magnesium) to grunerite (iron) endmembers, where the dividing line is placed at 30% magnesium.

In addition, the orthoamphiboles, anthophyllite and gedrite, which differ in their aluminium content, form a continuous solid solution at elevated temperature. As the amphibole cools, the two end members exsolve to form very thin layers (lamellae).

Hornblende is highly variable in composition, and includes at least five solid solution series: magnesiohornblende-ferrohornblende (), tschermakite-ferrotschermakite (), edenite-ferroedenite (), pargasite-ferropargasite () and magnesiohastingstite-hastingsite (). In addition, titanium, manganese, or chromium can substitute for some of the cations and oxygen, fluorine, or chlorine for some of the hydroxide. The different chemical types are almost impossible to distinguish even by optical or X-ray methods, and detailed chemical analysis using an electron microprobe is required.

Glaucophane to riebeckite form yet another solid solution series, which also extends towards hornblende and arfvedsonite.

There is &quot;not&quot; a continuous series between calcic clinoamphiboles, such as hornblende, and low-calcium amphiboles, such as orthoamphiboles or the cummingtonite-grunerite series. Compositions intermediate in calcium are almost nonexistent in nature. However, there is a solid solution series between hornblende and tremolite-actinolite at elevated temperature. A miscibility gap exists at lower temperatures, and, as a result, hornblende often contains exsolution lamellae of grunerite.

===Descriptions===
On account of the wide variations in chemical composition, the different members vary considerably in properties and general appearance.

Anthophyllite occurs as brownish, fibrous or lamellar masses with hornblende in mica-schist at Kongsberg in Norway and some other localities. An aluminous related species is known as gedrite and a deep green Russian variety containing little iron as kupfferite.

Hornblende is an important constituent of many igneous rocks. It is also an important constituent of amphibolites formed by metamorphism of basalt.

Actinolite is an important and common member of the monoclinic series, forming radiating groups of acicular crystals of a bright green or greyish-green color. It occurs frequently as a constituent of greenschists. The name (from Greek &quot;ἀκτίς, ἀκτῖνος/aktís, aktînos&quot;, a &#x27;ray&#x27; and &quot;λίθος/líthos&quot;, a &#x27;stone&#x27;) is a translation of the old German word &quot;Strahlstein&quot; (radiated stone).

Glaucophane, crocidolite, riebeckite and arfvedsonite form a somewhat special group of alkali-amphiboles. The first two are blue fibrous minerals, with glaucophane occurring in blueschists and crocidolite (blue asbestos) in ironstone formations, both resulting from dynamo-metamorphic processes. The latter two are dark green minerals, which occur as original constituents of igneous rocks rich in sodium, such as nepheline-syenite and phonolite.

Pargasite is a rare magnesium-rich variety of hornblende with essential sodium, usually found in ultramafic rocks. For instance, it occurs in uncommon mantle xenoliths, carried up by kimberlite. It is hard, dense, black and usually automorphic, with a red-brown pleochroism in petrographic thin section.

<doc id="59249" wikidata="Q34887" url="?curid=59249" title="Papaya">
<text>The papaya (, ), papaw, () or pawpaw () is the plant species Carica papaya, one of the 21 accepted species in the genus &quot;Carica&quot; of the family Caricaceae, and also the name of its fruit. It was first domesticated in Mesoamerica, within modern-day southern Mexico and Central America. It is grown in several countries in regions with a tropical climate. In 2022, India produced 38% of the world&#x27;s supply of papayas.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;papaya&quot; derives from Arawak via Spanish, and is also the name for the plant. The name &quot;papaw&quot; or &quot;pawpaw&quot; is used alternatively for the fruit only in some regions.

== Description ==
The papaya is a small, sparsely branched tree, usually with a single stem growing from tall, with spirally arranged leaves confined to the top of the trunk. The lower trunk is conspicuously scarred where leaves and fruit were borne. The leaves are large, in diameter, deeply palmately lobed, with seven lobes. All plant parts contain latex in articulated laticifers.
=== Flowers ===
Papayas are dioecious. The flowers are five-parted and highly dimorphic; the male flowers have the stamens fused to the petals. There are two different types of papaya flowers. The female flowers have a superior ovary and five contorted petals loosely connected at the base.

Male and female flowers are borne in the leaf axils; the male flowers are in multiflowered dichasia, and the female ones are in few-flowered dichasia. The pollen grains are elongated and approximately 35 microns in length. The flowers are sweet-scented, open at night, and are wind- or insect-pollinated.
=== Fruit ===
The fruit is a large berry about long and in diameter. It is ripe when it feels soft (as soft as a ripe avocado or softer) and its skin has attained an amber to orange hue. Along the walls of the large central cavity are attached numerous black seeds.

=== Chemistry ===
Papaya skin, pulp, and seeds contain a variety of phytochemicals, including carotenoids and polyphenols, as well as benzyl isothiocyanates and benzyl glucosinates, with skin and pulp levels that increase during ripening. The carotenoids, lutein and beta-carotene, are prominent in the yellow skin, while lycopene is dominant in the red flesh (table). Papaya seeds also contain the cyanogenic substance prunasin. The green fruit contains papain, a cysteine protease enzyme used to tenderize meat (see below).

==Distribution and habitat==
Native to tropical America, papaya originates from southern Mexico and Central America. Papaya is also considered native to southern Florida, introduced by predecessors of the Calusa no later than AD 300. Spaniards introduced papaya to the Old World in the 16th century. Papaya cultivation is now nearly pantropical, spanning Hawaii, Central Africa, India, and Australia.

Wild populations of papaya are generally confined to naturally disturbed tropical forests. Papaya is found in abundance on Everglades hammocks following major hurricanes, but is otherwise infrequent. In the rain forests of southern Mexico, papaya thrives and reproduces quickly in canopy gaps while dying off in the mature closed-canopy forests.

== Ecology ==

=== Viruses ===
Papaya ringspot virus is a well-known virus within plants in Florida. The first signs of the virus are yellowing and vein-clearing of younger leaves and mottling yellow leaves. Infected leaves may obtain blisters, roughen, or narrow, with blades sticking upwards from the middle of the leaves. The petioles and stems may develop dark green greasy streaks and, in time, become shorter. The ringspots are circular, C-shaped markings that are a darker green than the fruit. In the later stages of the virus, the markings may become gray and crusty. Viral infections impact growth and reduce the fruit&#x27;s quality. One of the biggest effects that viral infections have on papaya is taste. As of 2010, the only way to protect papaya from this virus is genetic modification.

The papaya mosaic virus destroys the plant until only a small tuft of leaves is left. The virus affects both the leaves of the plant and the fruit. Leaves show thin, irregular, dark-green lines around the borders and clear areas around the veins. The more severely affected leaves are irregular and linear in shape. The virus can infect the fruit at any stage of its maturity. Fruits as young as two weeks old have been spotted with dark-green ringspots about 1 inch (25 mm) in diameter. Rings on the fruit are most likely seen on either the stem end or the blossom end. In the early stages of the ringspots, the rings tend to be many closed circles, but as the disease develops, the rings increase in diameter consisting of one large ring. The difference between the ringspot and the mosaic viruses is the ripe fruit in the ringspot has a mottling of colors, and the mosaic does not.

=== Fungi and oomycetes ===
The fungus anthracnose attacks papaya, especially mature fruits. The disease starts small with very few signs, such as water-soaked spots on ripening fruits. The spots become sunken, turn brown or black, and may get bigger. In some of the older spots, the fungus may produce pink spores. The fruit ends up being soft and having an off flavor because the fungus grows into the fruit.

The fungus powdery mildew occurs as a superficial white presence on the leaf&#x27;s surface, which is easily recognized. Tiny, light yellow spots begin on the lower surfaces of the leaf as the disease starts to make its way. The spots enlarge, and white powdery growth appears on the leaves. The infection usually appears at the upper leaf surface as white fungal growth. Powdery mildew is not as severe as other diseases.

The fungus-like oomycete &quot;Phytophthora&quot; causes damping-off, root rot, stem rot, stem girdling, and fruit rot. Damping-off happens in young plants by wilting and death. The spots on established plants start as white, water-soaked lesions at the fruit and branch scars. These spots enlarge and eventually cause death. The disease&#x27;s most dangerous feature is the fruit&#x27;s infection, which may be toxic to consumers. The roots can also be severely and rapidly infected, causing the plant to brown and wilt away, collapsing within days.

=== Pests ===

The papaya fruit fly lays its eggs inside of the fruit, possibly up to 100 or more eggs. The eggs usually hatch within 12 days when they begin to feed on seeds and interior parts of the fruit. When the larvae mature, usually 16 days after being hatched, they eat their way out of the fruit, drop to the ground, and pupate in the soil to emerge within one to two weeks later as mature flies. The infected papaya turns yellow and drops to the ground after the papaya fruit fly infestation.

The two-spotted spider mite is a 0.5-mm-long brown or orange-red or a green, greenish-yellow translucent oval pest. They all have needle-like piercing-sucking mouthparts and feed by piercing the plant tissue with their mouthparts, usually on the underside of the plant. The spider mites spin fine threads of webbing on the host plant, and when they remove the sap, the mesophyll tissue collapses, and a small chlorotic spot forms at the feeding sites. The leaves of the papaya fruit turn yellow, gray, or bronze. If the spider mites are not controlled, they can cause the death of the fruit.

The papaya whitefly lays yellow, oval eggs that appear dusted on the undersides of the leaves. They eat papaya leaves, therefore damaging the fruit. There, the eggs developed into flies in three stages called instars. The first instar has well-developed legs and is the only mobile immature life stage. The crawlers insert their mouthparts in the lower surfaces of the leaf when they find it suitable and usually do not move again in this stage. The next instars are flattened, oval, and scale-like. In the final stage, the pupal whiteflies are more convex, with large, conspicuously red eyes.

Papayas are one of the most common hosts for fruit flies like &quot;A. suspensa&quot;, which lay their eggs in overripe or spoiled papayas. The larvae of these flies then consume the fruit to gain nutrients until they can proceed into the pupal stage. This parasitism has led to extensive economic costs for nations in Central America.

== Cultivation ==
Historical accounts from 18th-century travelers and botanists suggested that papaya seeds were transported from the Caribbean to Malacca and then to India. From Malacca or the Philippines, papaya spread throughout Asia and into the South Pacific region. Credit for introducing papaya to Hawaii is often given to Francisco de Paula Marín, a Spanish explorer and horticulturist, who brought it from the Marquesas Islands in the early 1800s. Since then, papaya cultivation has expanded to all tropical countries and many subtropical regions worldwide. Today, papaya is grown extensively across the globe, owing to its adaptability to various climates and its popularity as a tropical fruit.

Papaya plants grow in three sexes: male, female, and hermaphrodite. The male produces only pollen, never fruit. The female produces small, inedible fruits unless pollinated. The hermaphrodite can self-pollinate since its flowers contain both male stamens and female ovaries. Almost all commercial papaya orchards contain only hermaphrodites.

Originally from southern Mexico (particularly Chiapas and Veracruz), Central America, northern South America, and southern Florida the papaya is now cultivated in most tropical countries. In cultivation, it grows rapidly, fruiting within three years. It is, however, highly frost-sensitive, limiting its production to tropical climates. Temperatures below are greatly harmful, if not fatal. In Florida, California, and Texas, growth is generally limited to the southern parts of those states. It prefers sandy, well-drained soil, as standing water can kill the plant within 24 hours.

===Cultivars===
Two kinds of papayas are commonly grown. One has sweet, red, or orange flesh, and the other has yellow flesh; in Australia, these are called &quot;red papaya&quot; and &quot;yellow papaw,&quot; respectively. Either kind, picked green, is called a &quot;green papaya.&quot;

The large-fruited, red-fleshed &#x27;Maradol,&#x27; &#x27;Sunrise,&#x27; and &#x27;Caribbean Red&#x27; papayas often sold in U.S. markets are commonly grown in Mexico and Belize.

In 2011, Philippine researchers reported that by hybridizing papaya with &quot;Vasconcellea quercifolia&quot;, they had developed papaya resistant to papaya ringspot virus (PRV), part of a long line of attempts to transfer resistance from &quot;Vasconcellea&quot; species into papaya.

===Genetically engineered cultivars===
&quot;Carica papaya&quot; was the first transgenic fruit tree to have its genome sequenced. In response to the papaya ringspot virus outbreak in Hawaii in 1998, genetically altered papaya were approved and brought to market (including &#x27;SunUp&#x27; and &#x27;Rainbow&#x27; varieties.) Varieties resistant to PRV have some DNA of this virus incorporated into the plant&#x27;s DNA. As of 2010, 80% of Hawaiian papaya plants were genetically modified. The modifications were made by University of Hawaii scientists, who made the modified seeds available to farmers without charge.

In transgenic papaya, resistance is produced by inserting the viral coat protein gene into the plant&#x27;s genome. Doing so seems to cause a similar protective reaction in the plant to &quot;cross-protection&quot;, which involves using an attenuated virus to protect against a more dangerous strain. Conventional varieties of transgenic papaya has reduced resistance against heterologous (not closely related to the coat gene source) strains, forcing different localities to develop their own transgenic varieties. As of 2016, one transgenic line appears able to deal with three different heterologous strains in addition to its source.

=== Production ===

In 2022, global production of papayas was 13.8 million tonnes, led by India with 38% of the world total (table). Global papaya production grew significantly over the early 21st century, mainly as a result of increased production in India and demand by the United States. The United States is the largest importer of papayas worldwide.

In South Africa, papaya orchards yield up to 100 tonnes of fruit per hectare.

== Toxicity ==

Papaya releases a latex fluid when not ripe, possibly causing irritation and an allergic reaction in some people. Because the enzyme papain acts as an allergen in sensitive individuals, meat that has been tenderized with it may induce an allergic reaction.

== Culinary use ==

The ripe fruit of the papaya is usually eaten raw, without skin or seeds. The black seeds are edible and have a sharp, spicy taste. The unripe green fruit is usually cooked due to its latex content.
Both green papaya fruit and its latex are rich in papain, a cysteine protease used for tenderizing meat and other proteins, as practiced currently by indigenous Americans, people of the Caribbean region, Pacific Islands, and the Philippines. It is included as a component in some powdered meat tenderizers. Papaya is not suitable for foods which set due to gelatin (such as jelly or aspic) because the enzymatic properties of papain prevent gelatin from setting.

=== Nutrition ===
Raw papaya pulp is 88% water, 11% carbohydrates, and contains negligible fat and protein (table). In a reference amount of , papaya fruit provides 43 kilocalories and is a significant source of vitamin C (69% of the Daily Value, DV) and a moderate source of folate (10% DV), but otherwise has a low content of micronutrients (table).

=== Southeast Asia ===
Green papaya is used in Southeast Asian cooking, both raw and cooked. In some parts of Asia, the young leaves of the papaya are steamed and eaten like spinach.

In Myanmar, the unripe papaya are cut into slices and dipped into sour, fermented, or spicy seasonings and dips. In Myanmar and Thai recipes, the unripe papaya are cut into thinner slices to make papaya salad. The reason the unripe papaya is used is because of the firmer and crunchier texture.

Papayas became a part of Filipino cuisine after being introduced to the islands via the Manila galleons. Unripe or nearly ripe papayas (with orange flesh but still hard and green) are julienned and are commonly pickled into &quot;atchara&quot;, which is ubiquitous as a side dish to salty dishes. Nearly ripe papayas can also be eaten fresh as &quot;ensaladang papaya&quot; (papaya salad) or cubed and eaten dipped in vinegar or salt. Green papaya is also a common ingredient or filling in various savory dishes such as &quot;okoy&quot;, &quot;tinola&quot;, &quot;ginataan&quot;, &quot;lumpia&quot;, and &quot;empanada&quot;, especially in the cuisines of northern Luzon.

In Indonesian cuisine, the unripe green fruits and young leaves are boiled for use as part of &quot;lalab&quot; salad, while the flower buds are sautéed and stir-fried with chilies and green tomatoes as Minahasan papaya flower vegetable dish.

In Lao and Thai cuisine, unripe green papayas are used to make a type of spicy salad known in Laos as &quot;tam maak hoong&quot; and in Thailand as &quot;som tam.&quot; It is also used in Thai curries, such as &quot;kaeng som&quot;.

=== South America ===
In Brazil and Paraguay, the unripe fruits are used to make sweets or preserves.

== Traditional medicine ==
In traditional medicine, papaya leaves have been believed useful as a treatment for malaria, an abortifacient, a purgative, or smoked to relieve asthma.

<text>The Gold Coast, also known by its initials, GC, is a coastal city and region in the state of Queensland, Australia, located approximately south-southeast of the centre of the state capital, Brisbane. It is Queensland&#x27;s second-largest city after Brisbane, as well as Australia&#x27;s sixth-largest city and the most populous non-capital city. The city&#x27;s central business district is located roughly in the centre of the Gold Coast in the suburb of Southport. The urban area of the Gold Coast is concentrated along the coast, sprawling almost 60 kilometres, joining up with the Greater Brisbane metropolitan region to the north and to the state border with New South Wales to the south. Nicknames of the city include the ‘Glitter Strip’ and the ‘Goldy’. The demonym of a Gold Coast resident is Gold Coaster.

The area that became the Gold Coast was originally inhabited by the indigenous Yugambeh people. The city grew from a collection of small townships, the earliest being Nerang in 1865. From the 1920s onwards, tourism led to significant economic growth in the region, and by 1959 the Gold Coast was declared a city, with its first skyscraper being built in 1960. The Gold Coast boomed from the 1980s onwards with skyscraper construction. This era was defined by the city&#x27;s ‘white-shoe brigade&#x27; developers, neon lights, and organised crime, particularly the yakuza and the Russian mafia. The late 20th century saw the city&#x27;s tourism diversify with theme park openings, and in the early 21st century became an international destination for film production.

The Gold Coast has a diverse economy with strengths in health, tourism, arts and culture, and construction, with a GDP of AU$45.3 billion as of 2023. The city ranks highly as one of the country&#x27;s cultural and creative hotspots, alongside content creators, a growing video games industry, and leads Australia in startups per capita.
The Gold Coast is central to the nation&#x27;s entertainment industry with a major film and television production industry, leading to the city&#x27;s metonym of Goldywood. The Gold Coast is also host of the AACTA Awards and the Gold Coast Film Festival.

The Gold Coast is a major tourist destination with a sunny, subtropical climate and has become widely known for its surfing beaches (such as Surfers Paradise), high-rise dominated skyline, theme parks, nightlife, and rainforest hinterland.

==History==

The Gold Coast is the ancestral home of a number of Indigenous clans of the Yugambeh people, including the Kombumerri, Mununjali, and Wangerriburra clans. Europeans arrived in 1823 when explorer John Oxley explored the Tweed River. The hinterland&#x27;s timber supply attracted people to the area in the mid-19th century.

A number of small townships developed along the coast and in the hinterland. The western suburb of Nerang was surveyed and established as a base for the industry and by 1870 a town reserve had been set aside. By 1873, the town reserve of Burleigh Heads had also been surveyed and successful land sales had taken place. In 1875, the small settlement opposite the boat passage at the head of the Nerang River, known as Nerang Heads or Nerang Creek Heads, was surveyed and renamed Southport, with the first land sales scheduled to take place in Beenleigh. Southport quickly grew a reputation as a secluded holiday destination for wealthy Brisbane residents.

Post-World War One Era saw the rise of the &quot;seaside shack&quot;. The seaside shack provided the opportunity for the coastal &quot;getaway&quot; with modest investment.  From 1914 to 1946, they popped up all along the South Coast. Seaside shacks were exceedingly cheap and were an early use of the concept of recycling. Many were built of disused or second grade timber, all kinds of materials were used for the holiday seaside shack – including fibro cement, metal containers, and left-over farm sheds; even disused trams were sold off as seaside shacks.

After the establishment of the Surfers Paradise Hotel in the late 1920s, the Gold Coast region grew significantly. The Gold Coast was originally known as the South Coast (because it was south of Brisbane). However, over-inflated prices for real estate and other goods and services led to the nickname of &quot;Gold Coast&quot; from 1950. South Coast locals initially considered the name &quot;Gold Coast&quot; derogatory. However, soon the &quot;Gold Coast&quot; simply became a convenient way to refer to the holiday strip from Southport to Coolangatta. The Town of South Coast was formed through the amalgamation of Town of Coolangatta and Town of Southport along with the coastal areas (such as Burleigh Heads) from the Shire of Nerang on 17 June 1949 with the effect of having the present-day Gold Coast coastal strip as a single local government area. As the tourism industry grew into the 1950s, local businesses began to adopt the term &quot;Gold Coast&quot; in their names, and on 23 October 1958 the Town of South Coast was renamed Town of Gold Coast. The area was proclaimed a city, despite the lack of a cathedral, less than one year later on 16 May 1959.

The area boomed in the 1980s as a leading tourist destination. In 1994, the City of Gold Coast local government area was expanded to include the Shire of Albert.

In 2007, the Gold Coast overtook the population of Newcastle, New South Wales, to become the sixth largest city in Australia and the largest non-capital city.

The Gold Coast hosted the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

==Demographics==

In the , the urban area of the Gold Coast had a population of 540,559 people. According to the , the population of the Gold Coast including rural areas was 569,997. The median age was 39 years old, 1 year older than the nationwide median. The male-to-female ratio was 48.6-to-51.4. The most commonly nominated ancestries were English (29.3%), Australian (22.5%), Irish (8.2%), Scottish (7.5%), and German (3.6%). 64% of people were born in Australia, while the other most common countries of birth were New Zealand (7.9%), England (5.2%), China and South Africa (1.2% each), and Japan (0.7%). Indigenous Australians accounted for 1.7% of the population. The most commonly spoken languages other than English were Mandarin (1.6%), Japanese (1.0%), Korean and Spanish (0.6% each), and Cantonese (0.5%). 

According to the Australian Official Census in 2021, the most common religious affiliations in Gold Coast reported were none (43.4%), Catholic (18.2%), Anglican (11.9%), Uniting Church (2.9%), Non-denominational Christian (3.1%), Presbyterian and Reformed (1.9%), Buddhism (1.4%), Pentecostal (1.3%), Baptist (1.1%), Hinduism (1.1%) and Islam (1.0%).

== Geography ==
The Gold Coast is approximately half covered by forests of various types. This includes small patches of near-pristine ancient rainforest, mangrove-covered islands, and patches of coastal heathlands and farmland with areas of uncleared eucalyptus forest. Of the plantation pine forests that were planted in the 1950s and 1960s, when commercial forest planting for tax minimisation was encouraged by the Commonwealth government, tiny remnants remain. Most of the Gold Coast area was covered by forest prior to European human settlement and extensive land clearing in the 19th century.

Gold Coast City lies in the southeast corner of Queensland, to the south of Brisbane, the state capital. The Albert River separates the Gold Coast from Logan City, a local government area south of the City of Brisbane.

Gold Coast City stretches from the Albert River, Logan River, and Southern Moreton Bay to the border with New South Wales (NSW) approximately south, and extends from the coast west to the foothills of the Great Dividing Range in World Heritage listed Lamington National Park.

The southernmost town of Gold Coast City, Coolangatta, includes Point Danger and its lighthouse. Coolangatta is a twin city with Tweed Heads located directly across the NSW border. At , this is the most easterly point on the Queensland mainland (Point Lookout on the offshore island of North Stradbroke is slightly further east). From Coolangatta, approximately forty kilometres of holiday resorts and surfing beaches stretch north to the suburb of Main Beach, and then further on Stradbroke Island. The suburbs of Southport and Surfers Paradise form the Gold Coast&#x27;s commercial centre. The major river in the area is the Nerang River. Much of the land between the coastal strip and the hinterland were once wetlands drained by this river, but the swamps have been converted into man-made waterways (over in length or over 9 times the length of the canals of Venice, Italy) and artificial islands covered in upmarket homes. The heavily developed coastal strip sits on a narrow barrier sandbar between these waterways and the sea.

To the west, the city borders a part of the Great Dividing Range commonly referred to as the Gold Coast hinterland. A section of the mountain range is protected by Lamington National Park and has been listed as a World Heritage area in recognition of its &quot;outstanding geological features displayed around shield volcanic craters and the high number of rare and threatened rainforest species&quot;. The area attracts bushwalkers and day-trippers. Important rainforest pollinating and seed-dispersing Black flying foxes (Pteropus alecto) are found in the area and may be heard foraging at night.
=== Urban structure ===

The City of Gold Coast includes suburbs, localities, towns and rural districts.

The declaration of Southport as a Priority Development Area (PDA) and new investment into the CBD is driving transformative change and creating new business and investment opportunities.

===Waterways===
Waterfront canal living is a feature of the Gold Coast. Most canal frontage homes have pontoons. The Gold Coast Seaway, between The Spit and South Stradbroke Island, allows vessels direct access to the Pacific Ocean from The Broadwater and many of the city&#x27;s canal estates. Breakwaters on either side of the Seaway prevent longshore drift and the bar from silting up. A sand pumping operation on the Spit pipes sand under the Seaway to continue this natural process.

Residential canals were first built in the Gold Coast in the 1950s and construction continues. Most canals are extensions to the Nerang River, but there are more to the south along Tallebudgera Creek and Currumbin Creek and to the north along the Gold Coast Broadwater, South Stradbroke Island, Coomera River and southern Moreton Bay. Early canals included Florida Gardens and Isle of Capri which were under construction at the time of a 1954 flood. Recently constructed canals include Harbour Quays and Riverlinks completed in 2007. There are over of constructed residential waterfront land within the city that is home to over 80,000 residents.

===Beaches===

The city consists of of coastline, with some of the most popular surf breaks in Australia and the world, including South Stradbroke Island, The Spit, Main Beach, Surfers Paradise, Broadbeach, Mermaid Beach, Nobby&#x27;s Beach, Miami, North Burleigh Beach, Burleigh Beach, Burleigh Heads, Tallebudgera Beach, Palm Beach, South Palm Beach, Currumbin Beach, Tugun, Bilinga, North Kirra Beach Kirra, Coolangatta, Greenmount, Rainbow Bay, Snapper Rocks and Froggies Beach. There is almost 42 km of unbroken beachfront. Duranbah Beach is one of the world&#x27;s best known surfing beaches and is often thought of as being part of Gold Coast City, but is actually just across the New South Wales state border in the Tweed Shire.

There are also beaches along many of the Gold Coast&#x27;s of navigable tidal waterways. Popular inland beaches include Southport, Budds Beach, Marine Stadium, Currumbin Alley, Tallebudgera Estuary, Jacobs Well, Jabiru Island, Paradise Point, Harley Park Labrador, Santa Barbara, Boykambil and Evandale Lake.Beach safety and management

The Gold Coast has Australia&#x27;s largest professional surf lifesaving service to protect people on the beaches and to promote surf safety throughout the community. The Queensland Department of Primary Industries carries out the Queensland Shark Control Program (SCP) to protect swimmers from sharks. Sharks are caught by using nets and baited drumlines off the major swimming beaches. Even with the SCP, sharks do range within sight of the patrolled beaches. Lifeguards will clear swimmers from the water if it is considered that there is a safety risk.

Gold Coast beaches have experienced periods of severe beach erosion. In 1967, a series of 11 cyclones removed most of the sand from Gold Coast beaches. The Government of Queensland engaged engineers from Delft University in the Netherlands to advise what to do about the beach erosion. The Delft Report was published in 1971 and outlined a series of works for Gold Coast Beaches including Gold Coast Seaway, works at Narrow Neck that resulted in the Northern Gold Coast Beach Protection Strategy and works at the Tweed River that became the Tweed River Entrance Sand Bypassing Project.

By 2005 most of the recommendations of the 1971 Delft Report had been implemented. City of Gold Coast commenced implementation of the Palm Beach Protection Strategy but ran into considerable opposition from the community participating in a NO REEF protest campaign. The City of Gold Coast Council then committed to completing a review of beach management practices to update the Delft Report. The Gold Coast Shoreline Management Plan will be delivered by organisations including the Environmental Protection Agency, City of Gold Coast and the Griffith Centre for Coastal Management. Gold Coast City is also investing into the quality and capacity of the Gold Coast Oceanway that provides sustainable transport along Gold Coast beaches.

===Climate===
The Gold Coast experiences a humid subtropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa/Cwa&quot;), with mild to warm winters and hot, humid summers. The city experiences substantial summer precipitation mostly concentrated in thunderstorms and heavy showers with rain events occasionally lasting up to a few weeks at a time giving residents &quot;the summer blues&quot;, while winter is pleasantly mild to warm with little rain. In fact, it is for this pleasant winter weather that both the city and the Sunshine Coast—the coastal region north of Brisbane—are internationally renowned. Extreme temperatures recorded at Gold Coast Seaway have ranged from on 19 July 2007 to on 22 February 2005, although the city rarely experiences temperatures above in summer or below in winter. The average temperature of the sea at Surfers Paradise ranges from in July and August to in February.

==Government==
Administratively, the Gold Coast is a local government area called the City of Gold Coast. The City of Gold Coast Council has 14 elected councillors, each representing a division of the city. Businessman Tom Tate is the current Mayor of the Gold Coast, first elected in 2012. Former mayors include Ron Clake, Gary Baildon, Lex Bell, Ray Stevens, Ern Harley and Sir Bruce Small, who was responsible for the development of many of the canal estates that are now home to thousands of Gold Coast residents.

At the state level, the Gold Coast area is represented by eleven members in the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. The seats they hold are: Bonney, Broadwater, Burleigh, Coomera, Currumbin, Gaven, Mermaid Beach, Mudgeeraba, Southport, Surfers Paradise and Theodore. Federally, the Gold Coast area is split between five divisions in the House of Representatives: Fadden (northern), Moncrieff (central) and McPherson (southern) are located entirely within the Gold Coast, while Forde (north-west) and Wright (south-west) encompass parts of the Gold Coast and other areas of Southeast Queensland.

Politically, the Gold Coast has often tilted conservative. It was a Country Party bastion for most of the first three decades after World War II, but increasing urbanisation has made it a Liberal stronghold. Labor has historically only done well around Labrador and Coolangatta. Only one Labor MP has ever represented a significant portion of the Gold Coast at the federal level since 1949; the three Gold Coast divisions have only returned Liberals since 1984. At the state level, Labor was fairly competitive in the Gold Coast for most of the early part of the 21st century. However, as part of its massive landslide in the 2012 state election, the Liberal National Party won every seat there. The LNP repeated its sweep of the Gold Coast seats at the 2015 election, and retained all but one Gold Coast seat at the 2017 state election.

Southport Courthouse is the city&#x27;s major courthouse and has jurisdiction to hear petty criminal offences and civil matters up to A$250,000. Indictable offences, criminal sentencing and civil matters above A$250,000 are heard in the higher Supreme Court of Queensland which is located in Brisbane. There is also a subsidiary Magistrates Court, located at the southern suburb of Coolangatta.

In 2013 a brawl between members of Outlaw motorcycle gangs also called &quot;bikies&quot; who fought each other outside a Broadbeach restaurant caused mass fear to restaurant patrons and police. This led to the toughest anti-bikie laws introduced in Australia known as Vicious Lawless Association Disestablishment Act 2013.

== Economy ==

In fifty years, Gold Coast City has grown from a small beachside holiday destination to Australia&#x27;s sixth largest city (and the country&#x27;s most populous non-capital city). Situated within South East Queensland&#x27;s growth corridor, the Gold Coast is one of Australia&#x27;s fastest growing large cities, with a 5-year annual average population growth rate to 2015 of 1.8%, compared to 1.5% nationally. Gross Regional Product has risen from A$9.7 billion in 2001, to A$15.6 billion in 2008, a rise of 61 percent. Tourism remains fundamental to Gold Coast City&#x27;s economy, with almost 10 million visitors a year to the area. In the past the economy was driven by the population derived industries of construction, tourism and retail. Some diversification has taken place, with the city now having an industrial base formed of marine, education, information communication and technology, food, tourism, creative, environment and sports industries. These nine industries have been identified as the key industries by the City of Gold Coast Council to deliver the city&#x27;s economic prosperity. Gold Coast City&#x27;s unemployment rate (5.6 per cent) is below the national level (5.9 per cent). The declaration of Southport as the Gold Coast central business district (CBD) and a Priority Development Area (PDA), as well as new investment into the CBD, is driving transformative change and creating new business and investment opportunities.

The Gold Coast Economic Development Strategy 2013–2023 outlines the framework for the city&#x27;s long-term growth and prosperity. The strategy outlines actions in the following areas, Innovation, Culture, Infrastructure, Competitive business, Workforce, International.

===Tourism===

The Gold Coast is the most popular tourist destination in Queensland. It is Australia&#x27;s 5th most visited destination by international tourists. Around 10 million tourists visit the Gold Coast area every year consisting of 849,114 international visitors, 3,468,000 domestic overnight visitors and 5,366,000 daytrip visitors. Tourism is the region&#x27;s biggest industry, directly contributing more than $4.4 billion into the city economy every year and directly accounting for one in four jobs in the city There are approximately 65,000 beds, of beach, of canal, 100,000 hectares of nature reserve, 500 restaurants, 40 golf courses and five major theme parks in the city.

Gold Coast Airport provides connection across Australia and internationally with airlines including Flyscoot, Jetstar, Qantas, Air New Zealand, Virgin Australia and Airasia X. Brisbane Airport is less than one hour from the centre of Gold Coast, and direct trains operate.
Gold Coast City has over 13,000 available guest rooms contributing over $335 million to the local economy each year. Accommodation options available range from hostels to five star resorts and hotels. Tourist attractions include surf beaches, and theme parks including Dreamworld, Sea World, Wet&#x27;n&#x27;Wild Water World, Warner Bros. Movie World, WhiteWater World, Topgolf, Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary, David Fleay Wildlife Park, Australian Outback Spectacular, and Paradise Country.

Since the opening of what was then the world&#x27;s highest residential tower in 2005 (it is now the 17th highest), the Q1 building has been a destination for tourists and locals alike. It is the second highest public vantage point in the southern hemisphere after the Eureka Tower in Melbourne. The observation deck at level 77 is the highest of its kind in Queensland and offers views in all directions, from Brisbane to Byron Bay. It towers over the Surfers Paradise skyline, with the observation deck high, and the spire extending nearly another hundred metres up. In total, the Q1 is high, making it the tallest building in Australia. Another famous tourist attraction are the Surfers Paradise Meter Maids, instituted in 1965 to put a positive spin on new parking regulations. To avoid tickets being issued for expired parking, the Meter Maids dispense coins into the meter and leave a calling card under the windscreen wiper of the vehicle. The Maids are still a part of the Surfers Paradise culture but the scheme is now run by private enterprise.

Chinatown, Gold Coast, is an integral part of the revitalisation of Southport as an international CBD.

===Film production===

The Gold Coast is the major film production hub in Queensland and has accounted for 75% of all film production in Queensland since the 1990s, with an expenditure of around $150 million per year. The Gold Coast is the third largest film production centre in Australia, behind Sydney and Melbourne.It is the filming site for major motion pictures including &quot;Muriel&#x27;s Wedding&quot; (1994), &quot;Ghost Ship&quot; (2002), &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; (2002), &quot;House of Wax&quot; (2005), &quot;Superman Returns&quot; (2006), &quot;Unbroken&quot; (2014), &quot;The Inbetweeners 2&quot; (2014), &quot;San Andreas&quot; (2015), &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales&quot; (2017), &quot;&quot; (2017), &quot;&quot; (2017), &quot;Pacific Rim: Uprising&quot; (2018), &quot;Aquaman&quot; (2018), &quot;Dora the Explorer&quot; (2019) and &quot;Godzilla vs. Kong&quot; (2021).

The Studios consists of eight sound stages, production offices, editing rooms, wardrobe, construction workshops, water tanks and commissary. These sound stages vary in size and have an overall floor area of 10,844 sq metres, making Warner Roadshow Studio one of the largest studio lots in the Southern Hemisphere. The Queensland Government actively supports the film and television production industry in Queensland and provides both non-financial and financial assistance through the Pacific Film and Television Commission.

==Culture==

The Gold Coast&#x27;s culture has been affected by rapid development and traditional marketing programs orbiting around &#x27;sun, sand, surf and sex.&#x27;

Despite rapid socio-economic changes and a tourist-centred image, there is evidence of local resident-driven culture (such as surf gangs) in geographical pockets and a broader &#x27;Gold Coaster&#x27; identity drawn from globalised resort and real estate marketing material. The Gold Coast hosts cultural activities that attract tourists and residents alike.

===Music===
Music groups in this region include the Northern Rivers Symphony Orchestra and Operator Please. Musicians Cody Simpson and Ricki-Lee Coulter are from the Gold Coast. Music events include Big Day Out, Good Vibrations Festival, Summafieldayze, the Blues on Broadbeach Festival and V Festival (2007–2009).

===Arts===
Home of the Arts (HOTA) is the Gold Coast&#x27;s premier cultural facility for visual and performing arts with a performance theatre, two cinemas and an underground venue. The theatre has hosted performance by the Imperial Russian Ballet, The Australian Ballet and the Queensland Ballet. Musicals, plays and a variety of performances are regularly scheduled. The city is also home to the Gold Coast City Art Gallery. Film festivals and the Comedy Club host international artists. A redeveloped Gold Coast cultural precinct opened before the city hosted the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

Former World Wrestling Entertainment performer Nathan Jones comes from the Gold Coast, as do Olympic gold medal-winning swimmer Grant Hackett, 2011 US Open tennis champion Samantha Stosur and Sally Pearson (who received the keys to the city).

The Gold Coast has garnered a reputation as a &quot;sporting graveyard&quot;, as many of the professional clubs that have represented the Gold Coast in national leagues since the 1980s experience generally poor on-field performances, consistently struggle to support themselves financially, and have generally folded within a decade of being founded; as of 2019 no Gold Coast-based team has won a premiership in a national professional club competition.

=== Commonwealth Games ===

The Gold Coast hosted the 2018 Commonwealth Games, an international multi-sport event for members of the Commonwealth, held between 4 and 15 April 2018. It was the fifth time Australia had hosted the Commonwealth Games and the first time a major multi-sport event achieved gender equality by having an equal number of events for male and female athletes.

=== Colleges and universities ===
The Gold Coast is home to two major university campuses: Bond University at Robina and Griffith University at Southport. Southern Cross University also operates a smaller campus in Bilinga near the Gold Coast Airport. TAFE Queensland also has five campuses at Southport, Robina, Benowa, Coomera and Coolangatta.

=== Schools and libraries ===
There are over 100 primary and secondary schools, both public and private and of a variety of denominations, including the selective state high school Queensland Academy for Health Sciences and single-sex private schools The Southport School and St Hilda&#x27;s School. The longest established public school on the Gold Coast is Southport State High School, having originally opened in 1916. There are a number of libraries located on the Gold Coast. For a full list see Gold Coast libraries.

== Health ==

In 2018, 61.6% of the city&#x27;s population was overweight or obese.

== Infrastructure ==

===Utilities===
Electricity

Electricity for the Gold Coast is sourced from Powerlink Queensland at bulk supply substations which is provided via the National Electricity Market from an interconnected multi-State power system. The Government-owned electricity corporation Energex distributes and retails electricity, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and value-added products and services to residential, industrial and commercial customers in South-East Queensland.

Water supply

The Hinze Dam southwest of Nerang is the population&#x27;s main water supply. The Little Nerang Dam which feeds into Hinze Dam can supplement part of the city area&#x27;s water needs, and both are managed by the city council directorate Gold Coast Water. Reforms of the way in which the water industry is structured have been announced by the State Government, with transfer of ownership and management of water services from local government to the state occurring in 2008–09. City of Gold Coast also sources water from Wivenhoe Dam, west of Brisbane for northern suburbs when the Hinze Dam, at one-tenth of Wivenhoe&#x27;s capacity, becomes low.

Water shortage and water restrictions have been current local issues, and a few new Gold Coast residential areas have recently included dual reticulation in their planning and development to supply water from a new water recycling plant being built concurrently. This will make available highly treated recycled water for use around the home in addition to potable water. The Gold Coast has received world recognition for this scheme in its Pimpama-Coomera suburbs.

Gold Coast Water has the capacity to supply up to 133 megalitres of desalinated water per day.

=== Transport ===
The car is the dominant mode of transport in the Gold Coast, with over 70% of people using it as their sole mode of travelling to work. The Gold Coast has an extensive network of arterial roads that link coastal suburbs with inland suburbs. In recent years, local and state governments have invested money in transport infrastructure on the Gold Coast to combat the increasing congestion on many of the city&#x27;s roads. The Gold Coast has an extensive public transport network that includes buses, heavy rail and light rail for commuting to work, visiting attractions, and travelling to other destinations. 
==== Road ====
A number of major roads connect the Gold Coast with Brisbane, New South Wales, and the surrounding areas. The Pacific Motorway (M1) is the main motorway in the area. Beginning at the Logan Motorway (M6) in Brisbane, it travels through the inland Gold Coast region and links with the Pacific Highway at the New South Wales/Queensland border near Tweed Heads. The Pacific Motorway is part of the Brisbane to Sydney corridor. Before the Tugun Bypass was completed in 2008, the motorway ended at Tugun. The Gold Coast Highway services the coastal suburbs of the Gold Coast, including Surfers Paradise, Southport, and Burleigh Heads. Starting at the Pacific Motorway at Tweed Heads, it runs parallel to the coast until it reaches Labrador, where it turns inland to meet the Pacific Motorway again at Helensvale. Other arterial roads include the Smith Street Motorway which connects Southport, Gold Coast&#x27;s CBD with the M1 in Parkwood. Other major roads include Reedy Creek Road, Nerang–Broadbeach Road, Robina Parkway and Southport–Burleigh Road.

==== Light rail ====

The Gold Coast&#x27;s light rail service is called , a line between Helensvale and Broadbeach that also connects the key activity centres of Southport and Surfers Paradise. The G:link was opened in 2014 between Broadbeach and Southport, with an extension to Helensvale completed in 2017 in preparation for the 2018 Commonwealth Games.

==== Heavy rail ====
Queensland Rail operates an inter-city rail service from Brisbane to the Gold Coast along the Gold Coast railway line. The line follows the same route as Brisbane&#x27;s Beenleigh railway line, continuing on after reaching Beenleigh. It then follows a route similar to that of the Pacific Motorway, passing stations at Ormeau, Coomera, Helensvale, Nerang and Robina before terminating at Varsity Lakes. An extension of the Gold Coast line to the Gold Coast Airport is proposed.

==== Bus ====

Kinetic Group (formerly Surfside Buslines prior to a re-branding in 2022) operates all public passenger services in the city under contract by Translink which coordinates the public transport network in South East Queensland. Services are frequent during the day, with intervals being as little as 5 minutes. Kinetic Group operates over a fleet of over 400 buses operating on over 70 lines covering the entire city.

==== Airports ====
The main International Airport, Gold Coast Airport is located in Coolangatta, approximately south of Surfers Paradise. Services are provided to interstate capitals and major cities as well as to major New Zealand cities, Malaysia, Japan, Indonesia and Singapore. In 2019, it was the sixth busiest airport in Australia.

Smaller private airfields are located in the northern suburbs of Coombabah (Southport Airport) and Norwell (Heck Field), catering to flight training, recreational and general aviation users.

===Projects===
* Stage 3 of the system to Burleigh Heads is under construction with it set to be open in 2025 and planning for Stage 4 is underway with that stage to open before the Brisbane 2032 Olympic Games.
* The existing heavy rail Gold Coast line will be extended to Coolangatta
* Pacific Motorway M1 upgrades program.

== Real Estate ==
The Gold Coast&#x27;s real estate market is one of the most dynamic in Australia, characterised by a combination of coastal luxury properties, residential developments, and investment opportunities. According to data from SQM Research, the region has experienced significant property value growth in recent years, with both the median house and unit prices showing strong upward trends. The market&#x27;s appeal is driven by its lifestyle offerings, proximity to major cities like Brisbane, and ongoing infrastructure improvements.

<doc id="59252" wikidata="Q39809" url="?curid=59252" title="Marketing">
<text>Marketing is the act of satisfying and retaining customers. It is one of the primary components of business management and commerce.

Marketing is typically conducted by the seller, typically a retailer or manufacturer. Products can be marketed to other businesses (B2B) or directly to consumers (B2C). Sometimes tasks are contracted to dedicated marketing firms, like a media, market research, or advertising agency. Sometimes, a trade association or government agency (such as the Agricultural Marketing Service) advertises on behalf of an entire industry or locality, often a specific type of food (e.g. Got Milk?), food from a specific area, or a city or region as a tourism destination.

Market orientations are philosophies concerning the factors that should go into market planning. The marketing mix, which outlines the specifics of the product and how it will be sold, including the channels that will be used to advertise the product, is affected by the environment surrounding the product, the results of marketing research and market research, and the characteristics of the product&#x27;s target market. Once these factors are determined, marketers must then decide what methods of promoting the product, including use of coupons and other price inducements.

==Definition==
Marketing is currently defined by the American Marketing Association (AMA) as &quot;the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large&quot;. However, the definition of marketing has evolved over the years. The AMA reviews this definition and its definition for &quot;marketing research&quot; every three years. The interests of &quot;society at large&quot; were added into the definition in 2008. The development of the definition may be seen by comparing the 2008 definition with the AMA&#x27;s 1935 version: &quot;Marketing is the performance of business activities that direct the flow of goods, and services from producers to consumers&quot;. The newer definition highlights the increased prominence of other stakeholders in the new conception of marketing.
Recent definitions of marketing place more emphasis on the consumer relationship, as opposed to a pure exchange process. For instance, prolific marketing author and educator, Philip Kotler has evolved his definition of marketing. In 1980, he defined marketing as &quot;satisfying needs and wants through an exchange process&quot;, and in 2018 defined it as &quot;the process by which companies engage customers, build strong customer relationships, and create customer value in order to capture value from customers in return&quot;. A related definition, from the sales process engineering perspective, defines marketing as &quot;a set of processes that are interconnected and interdependent with other functions of a business aimed at achieving customer interest and satisfaction&quot;.

Some definitions of marketing highlight marketing&#x27;s ability to produce value to shareholders of the firm as well. In this context, marketing can be defined as &quot;the management process that seeks to maximise returns to shareholders by developing relationships with valued customers and creating a competitive advantage&quot;. For instance, the Chartered Institute of Marketing defines marketing from a customer-centric perspective, focusing on &quot;the management process responsible for identifying, anticipating and satisfying customer requirements profitably&quot;.

In the past, marketing practice tended to be seen as a creative industry, which included advertising, distribution and selling, and even today many parts of the marketing process (e.g. product design, art director, brand management, advertising, inbound marketing, copywriting etc.) involve the use of the creative arts. However, because marketing makes extensive use of social sciences, psychology, sociology, mathematics, economics, anthropology and neuroscience, the profession is now widely recognized as a science. Marketing science has developed a concrete process that can be followed to create a marketing plan.

==Concept==
The &quot;marketing concept&quot; proposes that to complete its organizational objectives, an organization should anticipate the needs and wants of potential consumers and satisfy them more effectively than its competitors. This concept originated from Adam Smith&#x27;s book &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; but would not become widely used until nearly 200 years later. Marketing and Marketing Concepts are directly related.

Given the centrality of customer needs, and wants in marketing, a rich understanding of these concepts is essential:

: &quot;Needs:&quot; Something necessary for people to live a healthy, stable and safe life. When needs remain unfulfilled, there is a clear adverse outcome: a dysfunction or death. Needs can be objective and physical, such as the need for food, water, and shelter; or subjective and psychological, such as the need to belong to a family or social group and the need for self-esteem.
: &quot;Wants:&quot; Something that is desired, wished for or aspired to. Wants are not essential for basic survival and are often shaped by culture or peer-groups.
: &quot;Demands:&quot; When needs and wants are backed by the ability to pay, they have the potential to become economic demands.

Marketing research, conducted for the purpose of new product development or product improvement, is often concerned with identifying the consumer&#x27;s &quot;unmet needs&quot;. Customer needs are central to market segmentation which is concerned with dividing markets into distinct groups of buyers on the basis of &quot;distinct needs, characteristics, or behaviors who might require separate products or marketing mixes.&quot; Needs-based segmentation (also known as &quot;benefit segmentation&quot;) &quot;places the customers&#x27; desires at the forefront of how a company designs and markets products or services.&quot; Although needs-based segmentation is difficult to do in practice, it has been proved to be one of the most effective ways to segment a market. In addition, a great deal of advertising and promotion is designed to show how a given product&#x27;s benefits meet the customer&#x27;s needs, wants or expectations in a unique way.

== B2B and B2C marketing ==
The two major segments of marketing are business-to-business (B2B) marketing and business-to-consumer (B2C) marketing.

=== B2B marketing ===
B2B (business-to-business) marketing refers to any marketing strategy or content that is geared towards a business or organization. Any company that sells products or services to other businesses or organizations (vs. consumers) typically uses B2B marketing strategies. The 7 P&#x27;s of B2B marketing are: product, price, place, promotion, people, process, and physical evidence. Some of the trends in B2B marketing include content such as podcasts, videos, and social media marketing campaigns.

Examples of products sold through B2B marketing include:

* Major equipment
* Accessory equipment
* Raw materials
* Component parts
* Processed materials
* Supplies
* Venues
* Business services

The four major categories of B2B product purchasers are:

* Producers- use products sold by B2B marketing to make their own goods (e.g.: Mattel buying plastics to make toys)
* Resellers- buy B2B products to sell through retail or wholesale establishments (e.g.: Walmart buying vacuums to sell in stores)
* Governments- buy B2B products for use in government projects (e.g.: purchasing weather monitoring equipment for a wastewater treatment plant)
* Institutions- use B2B products to continue operation (e.g.: schools buying printers for office use)

=== B2C marketing ===
Business-to-consumer marketing, or B2C marketing, refers to the tactics and strategies in which a company promotes its products and services to individual people.

Traditionally, this could refer to individuals shopping for personal products in a broad sense. More recently the term B2C refers to the online selling of consumer products.&lt;

=== C2B marketing ===
Consumer-to-business marketing or C2B marketing is a business model where the end consumers create products and services which are consumed by businesses and organizations. It is diametrically opposed to the popular concept of B2C or Business- to- Consumer where the companies make goods and services available to the end consumers. In this type of business model, businesses profit from consumers&#x27; willingness to name their own price or contribute data or marketing to the company, while consumers benefit from flexibility, direct payment, or free or reduced-price products and services. One of the major benefit of this type of business model is that it offers a company a competitive advantage in the market.

=== C2C marketing ===
Customer to customer marketing or C2C marketing represents a market environment where one customer purchases goods from another customer using a third-party business or platform to facilitate the transaction. C2C companies are a new type of model that has emerged with e-commerce technology and the sharing economy.

=== Differences in B2B and B2C marketing ===
The different goals of B2B and B2C marketing lead to differences in the B2B and B2C markets. The main differences in these markets are demand, purchasing volume, number of customers, customer concentration, distribution, buying nature, buying influences, negotiations, reciprocity, leasing and promotional methods.

*Demand: B2B demand is derived because businesses buy products based on how much demand there is for the final consumer product. Businesses buy products based on customer&#x27;s wants and needs. B2C demand is primarily because customers buy products based on their own wants and needs.
*Purchasing volume: Businesses buy products in large volumes to distribute to consumers. Consumers buy products in smaller volumes suitable for personal use.
*Number of customers: There are relatively fewer businesses to market to than direct consumers.
*Customer concentration: Businesses that specialize in a particular market tend to be geographically concentrated while customers that buy products from these businesses are not concentrated.
*Distribution: B2B products pass directly from the producer of the product to the business while B2C products may additionally go through a wholesaler or retailer.
*Buying nature: B2B purchasing is a formal process done by professional buyers and sellers, while B2C purchasing is informal.
*Buying influences: B2B purchasing is influenced by multiple people in various departments such as quality control, accounting, and logistics while B2C marketing is only influenced by the person making the purchase and possibly a few others.
*Negotiations: In B2B marketing, negotiating for lower prices or added benefits is commonly accepted while in B2C marketing (particularly in Western cultures) prices are fixed.
*Reciprocity: Businesses tend to buy from businesses they sell to. For example, a business that sells printer ink is more likely to buy office chairs from a supplier that buys the business&#x27;s printer ink. In B2C marketing, this does not occur because consumers are not also selling products.
*Leasing: Businesses tend to lease expensive items while consumers tend to save up to buy expensive items.
*Promotional methods: In B2B marketing, the most common promotional method is personal selling. B2C marketing mostly uses sales promotion, public relations, advertising, and social media.

== Marketing management orientations ==

A marketing orientation has been defined as a &quot;philosophy of business management.&quot; or &quot;a corporate state of mind&quot; or as an &quot;organizational culture.&quot; Although scholars continue to debate the precise nature of specific concepts that inform marketing practice, the most commonly cited orientations are as follows:

* Product concept: mainly concerned with the quality of its product. It has largely been supplanted by the marketing orientation, except for haute couture and arts marketing.
* Production concept: specializes in producing as much as possible of a given product or service in order to achieve economies of scale or economies of scope. It dominated marketing practice from the 1860s to the 1930s, yet can still be found in some companies or industries. Specifically, Kotler and Armstrong note that the production philosophy is &quot;one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers... [and] is still useful in some situations.&quot;
* Selling concept: focuses on the selling/promotion of the firm&#x27;s existing products, rather than developing new products to satisfy unmet needs or wants primarily through promotion and direct sales techniques, largely for &quot;unsought goods&quot; in industrial companies. A 2011 meta analyses found that the factors with the greatest impact on sales performance are a salesperson&#x27;s sales related knowledge (market segments, presentation skills, conflict resolution, and products), degree of adaptiveness, role clarity, cognitive aptitude, motivation and interest in a sales role).

* Marketing concept: This is the most common concept used in contemporary marketing, and is a customer-centric approach based on products that suit new consumer tastes. These firms engage in extensive market research, use R&amp;D (Research &amp; Development), and then use promotion techniques. The marketing orientation includes:
** &quot;Customer orientation&quot;: A firm in the market economy can survive by producing goods that people are willing and able to buy. Consequently, ascertaining consumer demand is vital for a firm&#x27;s future viability and even existence as a going concern.
** &quot;Organizational orientation&quot;: The marketing department is of prime importance within the functional level of an organization. Information from the marketing department is used to guide the actions of a company&#x27;s other departments. A marketing department could ascertain (via marketing research) that consumers desired a new type of product, or a new usage for an existing product. With this in mind, the marketing department would inform the R&amp;D department to create a prototype of a product/service based on consumers&#x27; new desires. The production department would then start to manufacture the product. The finance department may oppose required capital expenditures since it could undermine a healthy cash flow for the organization.
* Societal marketing concept: Social responsibility that goes beyond satisfying customers and providing superior value embraces societal stakeholders such as employees, customers, and local communities. Companies that adopt this perspective typically practice triple bottom line reporting and publish financial, social and environmental impact reports. Sustainable marketing or green marketing is an extension of societal marketing.

==The marketing mix==

A marketing mix is a foundational tool used to guide decision making in marketing. The marketing mix represents the basic tools that marketers can use to bring their products or services to the market. They are the foundation of managerial marketing and the marketing plan typically devotes a section to the marketing mix.

=== The 4Ps ===

The 4Ps refers to four broad categories of marketing decisions, namely: &quot;product&quot;, &quot;price&quot;, &quot;promotion&quot;, and &quot;place&quot;. The origins of the 4 Ps can be traced to the late 1940s. The first known mention has been attributed to a Professor of Marketing at Harvard University, James Culliton.

The 4 Ps, in its modern form, was first proposed in 1960 by E. Jerome McCarthy; who presented them within a managerial approach that covered analysis, consumer behavior, market research, market segmentation, and planning. Phillip Kotler, popularised this approach and helped spread the 4 Ps model. McCarthy&#x27;s 4 Ps have been widely adopted by both marketing academics and practitioners.
==== Outline ====

;Product
: The product aspects of marketing deal with the specifications of the actual goods or services, and how it relates to the end-user&#x27;s needs and wants. The product element consists of product design, new product innovation, branding, packaging, and labeling. The scope of a product generally includes supporting elements such as warranties, guarantees, and support. Branding, a key aspect of the product management, refers to the various methods of communicating a brand identity for the product, brand, or company.
;Pricing: This refers to the process of setting a price for a product, including discounts. The price need not be monetary; it can simply be what is exchanged for the product or services, e.g. time, energy, or attention or any sacrifices consumers make in order to acquire a product or service. The price is the cost that a consumer pays for a product—monetary or not. Methods of setting prices are in the domain of pricing science.
; Place (or distribution): This refers to how the product gets to the customer; the distribution channels and intermediaries such as wholesalers and retailers who enable customers to access products or services in a convenient manner. This third P has also sometimes been called &quot;Place&quot; or &quot;Placement&quot;, referring to the channel by which a product or service is sold (e.g. online vs. retail), which geographic region or industry, to which segment (young adults, families, business people), etc. also referring to how the environment in which the product is sold in can affect sales.
;Promotion:This includes all aspects of marketing communications: advertising, sales promotion, including promotional education, public relations, personal selling, product placement, branded entertainment, event marketing, trade shows, and exhibitions. This fourth P is focused on providing a message to get a response from consumers. The message is designed to persuade or tell a story to create awareness.

==== Criticisms ====
One of the limitations of the 4Ps approach is its emphasis on an inside-out view. An &quot;inside-out&quot; approach is the traditional planning approach where the organization identifies its desired goals and objectives, which are often based around what has always been done. Marketing&#x27;s task then becomes one of &quot;selling&quot; the organization&#x27;s products and messages to the &quot;outside&quot; or external stakeholders. In contrast, an &quot;outside-in&quot; approach first seeks to understand the needs and wants of the consumer.

From a model-building perspective, the 4 Ps has attracted a number of criticisms. Well-designed models should exhibit clearly defined categories that are mutually exclusive, with no overlap. Yet, the 4 Ps model has extensive overlapping problems. Several authors stress the hybrid nature of the fourth P, mentioning the presence of two important dimensions, &quot;communication&quot; (general and informative communications such as public relations and corporate communications) and &quot;promotion&quot; (persuasive communications such as advertising and direct selling). Certain marketing activities, such as personal selling, may be classified as either &quot;promotion&quot; or as part of the place (i.e., distribution) element. Some pricing tactics, such as promotional pricing, can be classified as price variables or promotional variables and, therefore, also exhibit some overlap.

Other important criticisms include that the marketing mix lacks a strategic framework and is, therefore, unfit to be a planning instrument, particularly when uncontrollable, external elements are an important aspect of the marketing environment.

====Modifications and extensions====

To overcome the deficiencies of the 4P model, some authors have suggested extensions or modifications to the original model. Extensions of the four P&#x27;s are often included in cases such as services marketing where unique characteristics (i.e. intangibility, perishability, heterogeneity and the inseparability of production and consumption) warrant additional consideration factors. Other extensions include &quot;people&quot;, &quot;process&quot;, and &quot;physical evidence&quot; and are often applied in the case of services marketing. Other extensions have been found necessary in retail marketing, industrial marketing and internet marketing.

=== The 4Cs ===
In response to environmental and technological changes in marketing, as well as criticisms towards the 4Ps approach, the 4Cs has emerged as a modern marketing mix model. Robert F. Lauterborn proposed a 4 Cs classification in 1990. His classification is a more consumer-orientated version of the 4 Ps that attempts to better fit the movement from mass marketing to niche marketing.

==== Outline ====
Consumer (or client)

The consumer refers to the person or group that will acquire the product. This aspect of the model focuses on fulfilling the wants or needs of the consumer.

Cost

Cost refers to what is exchanged in return for the product. Cost mainly consists of the monetary value of the product. Cost also refers to anything else the consumer must sacrifice to attain the product, such as time or money spent on transportation to acquire the product.

Convenience

Like &quot;Place&quot; in the 4Ps model, convenience refers to where the product will be sold. This, however, not only refers to physical stores but also whether the product is available in person or online. The convenience aspect emphasizes making it as easy as possible for the consumer to attain the product, thus making them more likely to do so.

Communication

Like &quot;Promotion&quot; in the 4Ps model, communication refers to how consumers find out about a product. Unlike promotion, communication not only refers to the one-way communication of advertising, but also the two-way communication available through social media.

==Environment==

The term &quot;marketing environment&quot; relates to all of the factors (whether internal, external, direct or indirect) that affect a firm&#x27;s marketing decision-making/planning. A firm&#x27;s marketing environment consists of three main areas, which are:
* The macro-environment (Macromarketing), over which a firm holds little control, consists of a variety of external factors that manifest on a large (or macro) scale. These include: economic, social, political and technological factors. A common method of assessing a firm&#x27;s macro-environment is via a PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Ecological) analysis. Within a PESTLE analysis, a firm would analyze national political issues, culture and climate, key macroeconomic conditions, health and indicators (such as economic growth, inflation, unemployment, etc.), social trends/attitudes, and the nature of technology&#x27;s impact on its society and the business processes within the society.
* The micro-environment, over which a firm holds a greater amount (though not necessarily total) control, typically includes: Customers/consumers, Employees, Suppliers and the Media. In contrast to the macro-environment, an organization holds a greater (though not complete) degree of control over these factors.
* The internal environment, which includes the factors inside of the company itself. A firm&#x27;s internal environment consists of: Labor, Inventory, Company Policy, Logistics, Budget, and Capital Assets.
==Research==
Marketing research is a systematic process of analyzing data that involves conducting research to support marketing activities and the statistical interpretation of data into information. This information is then used by managers to plan marketing activities, gauge the nature of a firm&#x27;s marketing environment and to attain information from suppliers. A distinction should be made between marketing research and market research. Market research involves gathering information about a particular target market. As an example, a firm may conduct research in a target market, after selecting a suitable market segment. In contrast, marketing research relates to all research conducted within marketing. Market research is a subset of marketing research. (Avoiding the word consumer, which shows up in both, market research is about distribution, while marketing research encompasses distribution, advertising effectiveness, and salesforce effectiveness).

The stages of research include:
* Define the problem
* Plan research
* Research
* Interpret data
* Implement findings

Well-known academic journals in the field of marketing with the best rating in VHB-Jourqual and Academic Journal Guide, an impact factor of more than 5 in the Social Sciences Citation Index and an h-index of more than 130 in the SCImago Journal Rank are

* Journal of Consumer Research
* Journal of Marketing
* Journal of Marketing Research
* Marketing Science

These are also designated as Premier AMA Journals by the American Marketing Association.
==Segmentation==

Market segmentation consists of taking the total heterogeneous market for a product and dividing it into several sub-markets or segments, each of which tends to be homogeneous in all significant aspects. The process is conducted for two main purposes: better allocation of a firm&#x27;s finite resources and to better serve the more diversified tastes of contemporary consumers. A firm only possesses a certain amount of resources. Thus, it must make choices (and appreciate the related costs) in servicing specific groups of consumers. Moreover, with more diversity in the tastes of modern consumers, firms are noting the benefit of servicing a multiplicity of new markets.

Market segmentation can be defined in terms of the STP acronym, meaning Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning.

Segmentation involves the initial splitting up of consumers into persons of like needs/wants/tastes. Commonly used criteria include:
* Geographic (such as a country, region, city, town)
* Psychographic (e.g. personality traits or lifestyle traits which influence consumer behaviour)
* Demographic (e.g. age, gender, socio-economic class, education)
*Gender
*Income 
*Life-Cycle (e.g. Baby Boomer, Generation X, Millennial, Generation Z)
*Lifestyle (e.g. tech savvy, active)
*Behavioral (e.g. brand loyalty, usage rate)

Once a segment has been identified to target, a firm must ascertain whether the segment is beneficial for them to service. The &quot;DAMP&quot; acronym is used as criteria to gauge the viability of a target market. The elements of DAMP are:
* Discernable – how a segment can be differentiated from other segments.
* Accessible – how a segment can be accessed via Marketing Communications produced by a firm
* Measurable – can the segment be quantified and its size determined?
* Profitable – can a sufficient return on investment be attained from a segment&#x27;s servicing?

The next step in the targeting process is the level of differentiation involved in a segment serving. Three modes of differentiation exist, which are commonly applied by firms. These are:
* Undifferentiated – where a company produces a like product for all of a market segment
* Differentiated – in which a firm produced slight modifications of a product within a segment
* Niche – in which an organization forges a product to satisfy a specialized target market

&quot;Positioning&quot; concerns how to position a product in the minds of consumers and inform what attributes differentiate it from the competitor&#x27;s products. A firm often performs this by producing a perceptual map, which denotes similar products produced in the same industry according to how consumers perceive their price and quality. From a product&#x27;s placing on the map, a firm would tailor its marketing communications to meld with the product&#x27;s perception among consumers and its position among competitors&#x27; offering.

==Promotional mix==

The promotional mix outlines how a company will market its product. It consists of five tools: personal selling, sales promotion, public relations, advertising and social media:
* Personal selling involves a presentation given by a salesperson to an individual or a group of potential customers. It enables two-way communication and relationship building, and is most commonly seen in business-to-business marketing but can also be found in business-to-consumer marketing (e.g.: selling cars at a dealership).

* Sales promotion involves short-term incentives to encourage the buying of products. Examples of these incentives include free samples, contests, premiums, trade shows, giveaways, coupons, sweepstakes and games. Depending on the incentive, one or more of the other elements of the promotional mix may be used in conjunction with sales promotion to inform customers of the incentives.
* Public relations is the use of media tools to promote and monitor for a positive view of a company or product in the public&#x27;s eye. The goal is to either sustain a positive opinion or lessen or change a negative opinion. It can include interviews, speeches/presentations, corporate literature, social media, news releases and special events.
* Advertising occurs when a firm directly pays a media channel, directly via an in-house agency or via an advertising agency or media buying service, to publicize its product, service or message. Common examples of advertising media include:

* Social media is used to facilitate two-way communication between companies and their customers. Outlets such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, Snapchat, Tik Tok and YouTube allow brands to start a conversation with regular and prospective customers. Viral marketing can be greatly facilitated by social media and if successful, allows key marketing messages and content in reaching a large number of target audiences within a short time frame. These platforms can also house advertising and public relations content.

== Marketing plan==

The area of marketing planning involves forging a plan for a firm&#x27;s marketing activities. A marketing plan can also pertain to a specific product, the introduction of a new product, the revision of current marketing strategies for existing products, as well as an organisation&#x27;s overall marketing strategy. The plan is created to accomplish specific marketing objectives, outlining a company&#x27;s advertising and marketing efforts for a given period, describing the current marketing position of a business, and discussing the target market and marketing mix to be used to achieve marketing goals.

An organization&#x27;s marketing planning process is derived from its overall business strategy. Marketing plans start by identifying customer needs through market research and how the business can satisfy these needs. The marketing plan also shows what actions will be taken and what resources will be used to achieve the planned objectives.

Marketing objectives are typically broad-based in nature, and pertain to the general vision of the firm in the short, medium or long-term. As an example, if one pictures a group of companies (or a conglomerate), the objective might be to increase the group&#x27;s sales by 25% over a ten-year period.

==Product life cycle==

The product life cycle (PLC) is a tool used by marketing managers to gauge the progress of a product, especially relating to sales or revenue accrued over time. The PLC is based on a few key assumptions, including:
* A given product would possess introduction, growth, maturity, and decline stage
* No product lasts perpetually on the market
* A firm must employ differing strategies, according to where a product is on the PLC

In the introduction stage, a product is launched onto the market. To stimulate the growth of sales/revenue, use of advertising may be high, in order to heighten awareness of the product in question.

During the growth stage, the product&#x27;s sales/revenue is increasing, which may stimulate more marketing communications to sustain sales. More entrants enter into the market, to reap the apparent high profits that the industry is producing.

When the product hits maturity, its starts to level off, and an increasing number of entrants to a market produce price falls for the product. Firms may use sales promotions to raise sales.

During decline, demand for a good begins to taper off, and the firm may opt to discontinue the manufacture of the product. This is so, if revenue for the product comes from efficiency savings in production, over actual sales of a good/service. However, if a product services a niche market, or is complementary to another product, it may continue the manufacture of the product, despite a low level of sales/revenue being accrued.

<text>A roundabout, a rotary and a traffic circle are types of circular intersection or junction in which road traffic is permitted to flow in one direction around a central island, and priority is typically given to traffic already in the junction.

In the United States, engineers use the term modern roundabout to refer to junctions installed after 1960 that incorporate design rules to increase safety. Compared to stop signs, traffic signals, and earlier forms of roundabouts, modern roundabouts reduce the likelihood and severity of collisions greatly by reducing traffic speeds and minimizing T-bone and head-on collisions. Variations on the basic concept include integration with tram or train lines, two-way flow, higher speeds and many others.

For pedestrians, traffic exiting the roundabout comes from one direction, instead of three, simplifying the pedestrian&#x27;s visual environment. Traffic moves slowly enough to allow visual engagement with pedestrians, encouraging deference towards them. Other benefits include reduced driver confusion associated with perpendicular junctions and reduced queuing associated with traffic lights. They allow U-turns within the normal flow of traffic, which often are not possible at other forms of junction. Moreover, since vehicles that run on gasoline typically spend less time idling at roundabouts than at signalled intersections, using a roundabout potentially leads to less pollution. When entering vehicles only need to give way, they do not always perform a full stop; as a result, by keeping a part of their momentum, the engine will require less work to regain the initial speed, resulting in lower emissions. Research has also shown that slow-moving traffic in roundabouts makes less noise than traffic that must stop and start, speed up and brake.

Modern roundabouts were first standardised in the UK in 1966 and were found to be a significant improvement over previous traffic circles and rotaries. Since then, modern roundabouts have become commonplace throughout the world, including Australia, the United Kingdom and France.

==History==

=== Origins and demise of traffic circles ===
Circular junctions existed before roundabouts, including:
* 1768 United Kingdom: The Circus in the city of Bath, Somerset was completed. This was constructed based on architectural considerations and not for traffic purposes.
* 1780 (ca.) France: The Place de l&#x27;Étoile around the Arc de Triomphe in Paris.
* 1791 US: Pierre Charles L&#x27;Enfant (who came to America in 1776) designed a plan of Washington, D.C., which was then being planned. This design contained several large places/street crossings. Many of them had a rectangular outer outline, but within each was a place, around which the streets should be built, thus reducing the number of arms/legs of each crossing.
* 1821 US: The Governor&#x27;s Circle (later renamed Monument Circle) of Indianapolis, Indiana (which gave the city the nickname &quot;The Circle City&quot;);
* 1877 France: The French architect Eugène Hénard was designing one-way circular intersections.
* 1879 Netherlands: The Keizer Karelplein in Nijmegen.
* 1899 Germany: Brautwiesenplatz (Bride Meadow(&#x27;s) Place) in Görlitz.
* 1904 US: Columbus Circle in Manhattan, New York.
* 1905 US: American architect William Phelps Eno favored small traffic circles.&lt;br&gt;He re-designed New York City&#x27;s famous Columbus Circle, which was finished in 1905.
* 1907 US: Architect John McLaren designed one of the first American traffic circles for both autos and streetcars (trams) in the Hanchett Residence Park in what is now San Jose, California.
* 1909 United Kingdom: The first British circular junction was built in Letchworth Garden City.

Although some may still be referred to as &quot;roundabouts&quot;, the operating and entry characteristics of these traffic circles differed considerably from modern roundabouts.

Circular intersections were built in the United States, though many were large-diameter &#x27;rotaries&#x27; that enabled high-speed merge and weave manoeuvres. Older-style traffic circles may control entering traffic by stop signs or traffic lights. Many allow entry at higher speeds without deflection, or require a stop and a 90-degree turn to enter. Because these circumstances caused a lot of vehicle collisions, construction of traffic circles and rotaries ceased in the 1950s, and some were removed.
=== 1960s development of modern roundabouts ===

Widespread use of the modern roundabout began when the UK&#x27;s Transport Research Laboratory engineers re-engineered and standardised circular intersections during the 1960s. Frank Blackmore led the development of the &quot;priority rule&quot; and subsequently invented the mini-roundabout to overcome capacity and safety limitations. The priority rule was found to improve traffic flow by up to 10%. In 1966, the United Kingdom adopted a rule at all circular junctions that required entering traffic to give way to circulating traffic. A Transportation Research Board guide reports that the modern roundabout represents a significant improvement, in terms of both operations and safety, when compared with older rotaries and traffic circles. The design became mandatory in the United Kingdom for all new roundabouts in November 1966. Australia and other British-influenced countries were the first outside the UK to build modern roundabouts.

=== Spread in Europe and North America since 1970s ===
* In 1951, Cyprus, British Crown colony back then, adopted the roundabout in the main cities.
* In the 1970s, France and Norway adopted the modern roundabout.
* In 1973, the U.S. city of Seattle began installing small traffic circles within existing intersections to calm traffic. , the city has installed over 1,200 traffic circles, primarily in residential neighborhoods.
* In 1980, Switzerland had 19 roundabouts.
* In 1980, Norway had 15 roundabouts.
*In the early 1980s, single-lane roundabouts (or mini-roundabouts) were also introduced in the Netherlands. It began in the relatively sparsely populated northern and eastern Netherlands because of fears that the roundabouts would not be able to cope with the traffic density of the Randstad; however, when it appeared the single-lane roundabouts had an even higher capacity than signalised intersections, they were constructed en masse in the western Netherlands as well.
* In 1983, France adopted the yield-at-entry rule on national routes; since then the country&#x27;s roundabouts have proliferated.
* In 1985, Norway put up yield signs at the entries to all its roundabouts. After this, safety and traffic flow rapidly improved, and Norwegian roundabouts increased from 15 in 1980, to 350 in 1990, to 500 in 1992.
* In 1987, Switzerland introduced the yield-at-entry rule; since then its roundabouts increased from 19 in 1980 to 220 in early 1992, while 500 more were being considered.
* In the late 1980s, the Netherlands saw significant growth with about 400 roundabouts constructed in just 6 years. Construction accelerated in the 1990s, and by 2001, there were an estimated 1,500 to 1,800 roundabouts in the Netherlands, more than half of which were located within built-up areas.
* In 1990, the US constructed its first modern roundabout, although older roundabouts have been somewhat common in parts of the Northeast (called rotaries or traffic circles).
* In 1991, France was building 1,000 roundabouts every year.
* As modern roundabouts rose in popularity in the 1980s, the old traffic circles fell out of favour and many were converted into modern roundabouts or other types of intersections.
* In 1999, Canada built its first modern roundabout.
* As of the beginning of the 21st century, roundabouts were in widespread use in Europe. For instance:
** In 2010, France had more than 30,000 roundabouts.
** There were around 25,000 in the United Kingdom in 2015.

=== North American introduction since 1990s ===
In the United States modern roundabouts emerged in the 1990s after years of planning and educational campaigning by Frank Blackmore and Leif Ourston, who sought to bring the by then well-established increased safety and traffic flow in other countries to America. The first was constructed in Summerlin, Nevada, in 1990 and was followed by another the following year. This roundabout occasioned dismay from residents, and a local news program said about it, &quot;Even police agree, [roundabouts] can be confusing at times.&quot; Between 1990 and 1995, numerous modern roundabouts were built in California, Colorado, Florida, Maryland, Nevada, and Vermont.

Municipalities introducing new roundabouts often were met with some degree of public resistance, just as in the United Kingdom in the 1960s.
* American confusion at how to enter and especially how to exit a roundabout was the subject of mockery such as featured in the film &quot;European Vacation&quot; (1985).
* A 1998 survey of municipalities found public opinion 68% opposed prior to construction, changing thereafter to 73% in favour.
* A 2007 survey found public support ranging from 22% to 44% prior to construction, and several years after construction was 57% to 87%.
* By 2011, however, some 3,000 roundabouts had been established, with that number growing steadily.

In the mid-2010s, about 3% of the then circa 4,000 U.S. modern roundabouts were located in Carmel, Indiana, whose mayor James Brainard had been actively promoting their construction; because of increased safety, injuries caused by car accidents in the city dropped by 80% after 1996. there were about 4,800 modern roundabouts in the United States. As an example, Washington state contained about 120 roundabouts , all having been built since 1997, with more planned.

The first Canadian traffic circles were in Edmonton. There were 7 such by 1954. However, they didn&#x27;t gain popularity in the rest of the country until the 1990s. They became increasingly popular amongst traffic planners and civil engineers in the 15 years thereafter due to their success in Europe. By 2014 there were about 400 roundabouts in Canada at the time (most in Quebec, Alberta, British Columbia and Ontario), or one per 90,000 inhabitants (compared to one per 84,000 inhabitants in the United States that year).

== Modern roundabout ==
A &quot;&quot;modern&quot; roundabout&quot; is a type of looping junction in which road traffic travels in one direction around a central island and priority is given to the circulating flow. Signs usually direct traffic entering the circle to slow and to give way to traffic already on it.

Because low speeds are required for traffic entering roundabouts, they are physically designed to slow traffic entering the junction to improve safety, so that the roads typically approach the junction &quot;radially&quot;; whereas older-style traffic circles may be designed to try to increase speeds, and have roads that enter the circle &quot;tangentially&quot;.

Roundabouts are normally not used on controlled-access highways because of the low speed requirement, but may be used on lower grades of highway such as limited-access roads. When such roads are redesigned to incorporate roundabouts, traffic speeds must be reduced via tricks such as curving the approaches.

Many traffic circles have been converted to modern roundabouts, including the former Kingston traffic circle in New York and several in New Jersey. Others have been converted to signalised intersections, such as the Drum Hill Rotary in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, which is now six lanes wide and controlled by four separate intersections.

Japan was first introduced to roundabouts in September 2014 to stop major accidents and traffic jams. 

=== Terminology ===
The word &quot;roundabout&quot; dates from early 20th-century use in the United Kingdom. A &quot;roundabout&quot; is also a traditional English name given to amusement rides known as a carousel, or a merry-go-round in other English-speaking countries.

In U.S. dictionaries the terms &quot;roundabout&quot;, &quot;traffic circle&quot;, &quot;road circle&quot; and &quot;rotary&quot; are synonyms. However, several experts such as Leif Ourston have stressed the need to distinguish between the characteristics of the modern roundabout and the nonconforming traffic circle:
;Modern roundabout:
*Entering traffic yields to circulating traffic
*Entering traffic aims at the centre of the central island and is deflected slowly around it
*Upstream roadway often flares at entry, adding lanes

;Nonconforming traffic circle:
*Entering traffic cuts off circulating traffic
*Entering traffic aims to one side of the central island (right side for right-hand traffic) and proceeds straight ahead at speed
*Lanes are not added at entry
The U.S. Department of Transportation adopted the term &quot;modern roundabout&quot; to distinguish those that require entering drivers to give way to others. Many old traffic circles remain in the northeastern US. Some modern roundabouts are elongated to encompass additional streets, but traffic always flows in a loop.

====Rotary====
In the United States, traffic engineers typically use the term &quot;rotary&quot; for large-scale circular junctions between expressways or controlled-access highways. Rotaries of this type typically feature high speeds inside the circle and on the approaches.

In the United States&#x27; New England region, however, a &quot;rotary&quot; is typically used as the general term for all roundabouts, including those with modern designs. State laws in these states mandate that traffic already driving in the rotary always has the right of way. For instance, in Massachusetts, &quot;Any operator of a vehicle entering a rotary intersection shall yield the right-of-way to any vehicle already in the intersection.&quot; In Rhode Island entering vehicles &quot;Yield to vehicles in the roundabout.&quot;

====Other terms====
In the dialect of Dundee in Scotland, a roundabout is called a &quot;circle&quot;.

In the English West Midlands, &quot;island&quot; is in common use.

In the Channel Islands a third type of roundabout, known as &quot;Filter in Turn&quot;, exists. Here approaching drivers neither give way to traffic on the roundabout, as normal, nor have priority over it, but take it in turns to enter from each. Almost all of Jersey&#x27;s roundabouts are of this type.

== Operation and design ==


The fundamental principle of modern roundabouts is that entering drivers give way to traffic within the roundabout without the need for traffic signals. Conversely, older traffic circles typically require circling drivers to give way to entering traffic. Roundabouts may also have an interior lane. Generally, exiting directly from an inner lane of a multi-lane roundabout is permitted, given that the intersecting road has as many lanes as the roundabout. By contrast, exiting from an inner lane of an older traffic circle is usually not permitted and traffic must first move into the outside lane.

Vehicles circulate around the central island in one direction at speeds of . In left-hand traffic countries they circulate clockwise (looking from above); in right-hand traffic, anticlockwise.

Multi-lane roundabouts are typically less than in diameter; older traffic circles and roundabout interchanges may be considerably larger. Roundabouts are roughly the same size as signalled intersections of the same capacity.

Design criteria include:
* Right-of-way: Whether entering or circling vehicles have the right of way. The New Jersey Driver&#x27;s Manual recommends that, in the absence of flow control signs, traffic yields based on &quot;the circle&#x27;s historically established traffic flow pattern&quot;, and there are no set rules. In New England, Washington, D.C., and New York State, entering traffic yields, as is the norm in virtually all countries outside of the U.S.
* Angle of entry: Angles range from glancing (tangential) that allow full-speed entry to 90 degree angles (perpendicular). Deflection is required to avoid vehicles entering at excessive speeds.
* Traffic speed: High entry speeds (over ) require circulating vehicles to yield, often stopping, which lowers capacity and increases crash rates compared to modern roundabouts.
* Lane changes: Allowed or not
* Diameter: The greater the traffic, the larger the circle.
* Island function: Parking, parks, fountains, etc.

=== Islands ===
Modern roundabouts feature a central island and sometimes pedestrian islands at each entry or exit often for decoration.

Denmark has begun widespread adoption of particular high islands, or if not possible, obstacles such as hedges or a ring of trees in larger examples. This is done to further increase the safety benefits of roundabouts, as the obstacles have been found to discomfort drivers more so than the roundabout itself compared to conventional intersections, thus initiating further observation and care taking of the driver. In Denmark, it was found to decrease accidents in roundabouts by 27% to 84% depending on height and type. In studies, heights of 0-0.9, 1-1.9 and 2+ metres were evaluated. It was found that for all heights, especially accidents leading to human injuries were reduced the most, by -47% to -84% for the aforementioned heights. The level of irritation to drivers is not to be understated, as it is the crucial point of the design: to force drivers to pay attention to the sides of the driving direction. This leads to drivers complaining about these designs, as Denmark in most regards embraces designing road infrastructure, such that the wanted driving behaviour leads to comfort i.e., lane width corresponding to speed limit and obstacles encouraging slowdown near points of safety concern such as schools. Such is the controversy for drivers that seasoned driving teachers complain about this discomfort a decade after its safety is proven and adoption widespread.

==== Central ====
The central island may be surrounded by a truck apron that is high enough to discourage drivers from crossing over it, but low enough to allow wide or long vehicles to navigate the roundabout. The island may provide a visual barrier, to alert approaching drivers to the presence of the roundabout, and to encourage drivers to focus on the traffic in the path of the circle. A visual barrier significantly reduces the accident rate. Otherwise, vehicles anywhere in or near the circle can cause those entering to stop and wait for them to pass, even if they are opposite, which unnecessarily reduces traffic flow. The barrier may be a landscaped mound, a raised wall, a tree or tall shrubs. Road signage or flagpoles may be erected at the top of a landscaped mound.

Some communities use the island for monuments, the display of large public art or for a fountain. Pedestrians may be prohibited from crossing the circling lane(s). Access to the central island requires an underpass or overpass for safety.

===== Art installations =====

Roundabouts have attracted art installations around the world:
* Bend, Oregon (United States); Bend&#x27;s Roundabout sculptures were honoured by Americans for the Arts as among the 37 most innovative approaches to Public Art in the country.
* Fuerteventura, Canary Islands (Spain); Local government displayed sculptures at several roundabouts.
* Many countries in Europe (France first, but also Germany, Austria, Italy, Spain, and others) show the widespread use of roundabouts as art installations.
* An inventory of roundabouts in France, made by Marc Lescuyer, listed 3,328 roundabouts with artistic decor early in 2010.
* The Minerva Roundabout in Guadalajara, Mexico, is one of the city&#x27;s most famous monuments. It features the goddess Minerva standing on a pedestal, surrounded by a large fountain, with an inscription saying &quot;Justice, wisdom and strength guard this loyal city&quot;.
* Several famous monuments in Europe, such as the Gate of Alcalá in Madrid, Spain or the Arc du Triomphe in Paris, France, have been isolated from street traffic by means of a roundabout.
* The Garces Memorial Circle in Bakersfield, California contains a statue to Father Francisco Garces.
* In the Philippines, the town of Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay has an Obelisk containing art and the Baybayin script.

==== Pedestrian ====
For larger roundabouts, pedestrian islands at each entry/exit encourage drivers to slow and prepare to enter the circle. They also provide a refuge where pedestrians may pause mid-crossing.
Vehicles or bicycles entering or exiting the roundabout must yield to all traffic including pedestrians.

=== Pedestrian crossing ===
Pedestrian crossings at each entry/exit may be located at least one full car length outside the circle. The extra space allows pedestrians to cross behind vehicles waiting to enter the circle, and to allow exiting vehicles to stop for pedestrians without obstruction. Each pedestrian crossing may traverse a pedestrian island for protection that also forces drivers to slow and begin to change direction, encouraging slower, safer speeds. On the island, the pedestrian crossing may become diagonal, to direct the gaze of those crossing into exiting traffic.

=== Bicycles ===
Physically separated bikeways best protect cyclists. Less optimally, terminating cycle lanes well before roundabout entrances requires cyclists to merge into the stream of motor traffic, but keeps cyclists in full view of drivers, at some cost in motor vehicle speed. Cyclists may also be permitted to use pedestrian crossings. 

Traditional cycle lanes increase vehicle–bicycle collisions. When exiting, a motorist must look ahead to avoid colliding with another vehicle or with pedestrians on a pedestrian crossing. As the intersection curves away from the exit, the path of an exiting vehicle is relatively straight, and so the motorist may often not slow substantially. To give way to a cyclist on the outside requires the exiting motorist to look toward the rear, to the perimeter. Other vehicles can obstruct the driver&#x27;s view in this direction, complicating the motorist&#x27;s task. The more frequent requirements for motorists to slow or stop reduce traffic flow. A 1992 study found that the risk to cyclists is high in all such intersections, but much higher when the junction has a marked bicycle lane or sidepath around its perimeter. Cycle lanes were installed at Museum Road, Portsmouth, but were replaced by a narrowed carriageway to encourage lane sharing.

The roundabout at the Brown Road and Loop 202 interchange in Mesa, Arizona, adopts a U.S.-recommended design. On-street pavement markings direct cyclists to enter the sidewalk at the end of the bike lane. Cyclists who choose to travel on the wide sidewalk, cross roundabout arms perpendicularly, well outside the circle. A pedestrian island allows pedestrians and cyclists to cross one lane at a time.

Protected roundabouts (or Dutch roundabout) were developed in the Netherlands, with cyclists separated from vehicles using dedicated lanes. As cyclists will conflict with motorists at the exit arms of the motorised roundabout, priority must be established. In the Netherlands, cyclists will normally be given priority to promote cycling over driving. As well as their use in the Netherlands and Denmark, these designs have been subsequently built in the United Kingdom and Ireland.

=== Capacity and delays ===
The capacity of a roundabout varies based on entry angle, lane width, and the number of entry and circulating lanes. As with other types of junctions, operational performance depends heavily on the flow volumes from various approaches. A single-lane roundabout can handle approximately 20,000–26,000 vehicles per day, while a two-lane design supports 40,000 to 50,000.

Under many traffic conditions, a roundabout operates with less delay than signalised or all-way stop approaches. Roundabouts do not stop all entering vehicles, reducing both individual and queuing delays. Throughput further improves because drivers proceed when traffic is clear without waiting for a signal to change.

Roundabouts can increase delays in locations where traffic would otherwise often not be required to stop. For example, at the junction of a high-volume and a low-volume road, traffic on the busier road would stop only when cross traffic was present, otherwise not having to slow for the roundabout. When the volumes on the roadways are relatively equal, a roundabout can reduce delays, because half of the time a full stop would be required. Dedicated left turn signals (in countries where traffic drives on the right) further reduce throughput.

Roundabouts can reduce delays for pedestrians compared to traffic signals, because pedestrians are able to cross during any safe gap rather than waiting for a signal. During peak flows when large gaps are infrequent, the slower speed of traffic entering and exiting can still allow crossing, despite the smaller gaps.

Studies of roundabouts that replaced stop signs and/or traffic signals found that vehicle delays were reduced 13–89 percent and the proportion of vehicles that stopped was reduced 14–56 percent. Delays on major approaches increased as vehicles slowed to enter the roundabouts.

Roundabouts have been found to reduce carbon monoxide emissions by 15–45 percent, nitrous oxide emissions by 21–44 percent, carbon dioxide emissions by 23–37 percent and hydrocarbon emissions by 0–42 percent. Fuel consumption was reduced by an estimated 23–34 percent.

==== Capacity modelling ====
Many countries have researched roundabout capacity. The software can help calculate capacity, delay and queues. Packages include ARCADY, Rodel, Highway Capacity Software and Sidra Intersection. ARCADY and Rodel are based on the Transport Research Laboratory mathematical model. The TRL approach is derived from empirical models based on geometric parameters and observed driver behaviour with regard to lane choice. Sidra Intersection software includes roundabout capacity models developed in Australia and the US.

Research on Australian roundabouts was conducted in the 1980s at the Australian Road Research Board (ARRB). Its analytical capacity and performance models differ from the TRL model significantly, following a lane-based gap-acceptance theory including geometric parameters.

Research on U.S. roundabouts sponsored by the Transportation Research Board (TRB) and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) culminated in a capacity model that was included in the &quot;Highway Capacity Manual&quot; (HCM) Edition 6 and the &quot;TRB-FHWA Roundabout Informational Guide&quot; (NCHRP Report 672). The HCM Edition 6 model is based on lane-based gap-acceptance theory. A recent NCHRP survey of US state transport agencies found that Sidra Intersection is the most widely used software tool in the US for roundabout analysis.

== Safety ==

Statistically, modern roundabouts are safer for drivers and pedestrians than both older-style traffic circles and traditional intersections. Compared with these other forms of intersections, modern roundabouts experience 39% fewer vehicle collisions, 76% fewer injuries and 90% fewer serious injuries and fatalities (according to a study of a sampling of roundabouts in the United States, when compared with the junctions they replaced). At junctions with stop signs or traffic lights, the most serious accidents are right-angle, left-turn or head-on collisions where vehicles move fast and collide at high impact angles, e.g. head-on. Roundabouts virtually eliminate those types of crashes. Instead, most crashes are glancing blows at low angles of impact. Further, a study based on satellite imagery of all intersections in Australia observed consistently low speeds on roundabouts compared to other intersection types, contributing to reduced injury severity in case of a crash.

Some larger roundabouts take foot and bicycle traffic through underpasses or alternate routes. However, an analysis of the New Zealand national crash database for the period 1996–2000 shows that 26% of cyclists reported injury crashes happened at roundabouts, compared to 6% at traffic signals and 13% at priority controlled junctions. The New Zealand researchers propose that low vehicle speeds, circulatory lane markings and mountable centre aprons for trucks can reduce the problem. The most common roundabout crash type for cyclists, according to the New Zealand study, involves a motor vehicle entering the roundabout and colliding with a cyclist who already is travelling around the roundabout (more than half of cyclist/roundabout crashes in New Zealand fall into this category). The next most common crash type involves motorists leaving the roundabout colliding with cyclists who are continuing farther around the perimeter.

=== Vision-impaired pedestrians ===
Poorly designed walkways increase risks for the vision-impaired, because it is more difficult than at a signalised intersection to audibly detect whether there is a sufficient gap in traffic to cross safely. At a signalised intersection, traffic comes to a stop, and an audible sound can be generated to indicate that it is time to cross.

This issue has led to a conflict in the United States between the vision-impaired and civil engineering communities. One solution is to provide manually-operated pedestrian crossing signals at each entry. This increases construction and operation costs, and requires some way to disrupt traffic long enough for the pedestrian to cross (such as a HAWK beacon) that defeats the purpose of the roundabout. Signalisation also increases delays for most pedestrians during periods of light traffic, since pedestrians need to wait for a signal to change before (legally) crossing.

Signalised pedestrian crossings are normally used on large-diameter roundabout interchanges rather than small-diameter modern roundabouts.

== Types of circular intersections ==
Large roundabouts, such as those used at motorway junctions, typically have two to six lanes and may include traffic lights to regulate flow.

Some roundabouts have a divider or subsidiary deflection island, by means of which is provided a &quot;free flow&quot; segregated left- (or right-) turn lane (for the UK see Design Manual for Roads and Bridges TD 51/03) between traffic moving between two adjacent roads, and traffic within the roundabout, enabling drivers to bypass the roundabout.

=== Gyratory system ===
The term &quot;gyratory&quot; (for example, Hanger Lane gyratory) is sometimes used in the United Kingdom for a large circular intersection with non-standard lane markings or priority arrangements, or where there are significant lengths of carriageway between the entry arms, or when buildings occupy the central island.

In the 21st century several gyratory systems in London have been removed, including Tottenham Hale and Elephant and Castle.

=== Smaller, small and mini-roundabouts ===

As the overall or external size of a roundabout (in the UK referred to as the Inscribed Circle Diameter – ICD) is reduced, so the maximum practicable (and prescribed) diameter for the central island is also reduced, whilst the width of the circulatory carriageway increases (due to the greater width of vehicle swept path at smaller turning radii). In most cases, this results in it being too easy – certainly when traffic is light relative to capacity – for drivers to traverse the roundabout at relatively high speed, with scant regard for road markings or the potential dangers to self or conflicts with other road users. To mitigate this risk, a proportion of the circulatory carriageway – an annulus around the central island – is segregated from general use by demarcation lines and differentiated from the outer annulus of the carriageway by a combination of a slightly raised surface, adverse crossfall, contrasting colours and textures and demarcating lines. The effect of this is to discourage drivers from taking a more direct path through the roundabout, their line of least resistance is more tightly curved (and therefore slower) but more bearable. The inner annulus provides for the trailing axles of longer or articulated vehicles to sweep across the inner annulus, which is therefore known as an over-run area (in UK usage), truck apron, or mountable apron.

The smaller the roundabout, the more such mitigation measures are likely to be abused – the less effective they will be. In the UK the minimum size for roundabouts with raised islands is 28 metre diameter ICD with a 4-metre diameter island. This threshold being driven primarily by vehicle geometry – which is globally relatively consistent – rather than driver behaviour, it is adopted in other jurisdictions too. Below this minimum size, the mini-roundabout prevails.

=== Mini-roundabouts ===
After developing the offside priority rule, Frank Blackmore, of the UK&#x27;s Transport Research Laboratory, turned his attention to the possibility of a roundabout that could be built at sites lacking room for a conventional roundabout.
Mini-roundabouts can incorporate a painted circle or a low dome but must be fully traversable by vehicles. Motorists can drive over them when there is no other traffic, but it is dangerous to do so otherwise. Once the practice is established it may be difficult to discourage. Mini-roundabouts use the same right-of-way rules as standard roundabouts but produce different driver behaviour. Mini-roundabouts are sometimes grouped in pairs (a double mini-roundabout) or in &quot;chains&quot;, simplifying navigation of otherwise awkward junctions. In some countries road signs distinguish mini-roundabouts from larger ones.

Mini-roundabouts are common in the UK, Ireland and Hong Kong (particularly on Hong Kong Island), as well as Irapuato in Mexico.

In the UK and also in other jurisdictions that have adopted mini-roundabouts, to drive across the central disc or dome when it is practicable to avoid it is an offence. Vehicles are required to treat the painted circle as if it were a solid island and drive around it. Some local authorities paint double white lines around the circle to indicate this, but these require permission from the Secretary of State for Transport. The central dome also must be able to be overrun by larger vehicles.

In the UK – and also in other highway jurisdictions – the maximum size (inscribed circle diameter) for a mini roundabout is 28 metres (30 yards).

===Raindrop roundabouts===

These roundabouts do not form a complete circle and have a &quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot; shape. They have also been used at bowtie intersections, replacing traffic signals that are inefficient without a turning lane. In addition to their use at intersections, raindrop roundabouts are also used in dogbone interchanges (described below).
===Balcony roundabout===
A balcony roundabout is just an elevated roundabout. They are constructed in such a way that vulnerable road users can cross underneath the roundabout. Footpaths and cycle paths along the different roads connect to the square under the roundabout. Vulnerable road users do not interfere with motorised traffic on the roundabout, reducing the risk of collision.

=== Turbo roundabouts ===
In the Netherlands, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the United Kingdom, Finland, Spain, Poland, Hungary, Slovenia, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, North Macedonia, Croatia, Germany, and the U.S. states of Alabama, California, and Florida, a relatively new type of two-lane roundabout designs is emerging, called &quot;turbo roundabouts&quot;. These designs require motorists to choose their direction before entering the roundabout, thereby eliminating many conflicting paths and choices on the roundabout itself so that traffic safety is increased, as well as speed and capacity. These designs, seen from above, typically result in a spiralling flow of traffic. One minor drawback is that turbo roundabouts are often marked out such that a U-turn by means of the roundabout is not possible for drivers approaching on certain arms.

Several variations of turbo roundabouts exist. They are frequently designed for the intersection of a major road crossing a road with less traffic.

An early application of the principle was a six-arm and therefore relatively large (and fast) non-circular roundabout at Stairfoot, Barnsley, South Yorkshire, which was given spiral marking about 1984. At that time the method was considered experimental and needed special consent from central authorities. The turbo roundabout was formally developed in 1996 in the Netherlands by Lambertus Fortuijn, a researcher from the Delft University of Technology. Similar roundabouts, with spiralling lane markings, have been used for many years in the UK e.g. the A176/A127 (eastbound) at Basildon, Essex (). However, it was not until 1997 that the UK&#x27;s national highway authorities published guidance (DMRB TA-78/97) that in effect endorsed the use of spiral markings in certain circumstances.

Turbo roundabouts can be built with raised lane separators (common in the Netherlands) or with lane markings only. The use of raised lane separators prevents road users from weaving (thereby reducing conflicts) but can make manoeuvring more difficult for large vehicles.

According to simulations, a two-lane roundabout with three exits should offer 12–20% greater traffic flow than a conventional, three-lane roundabout of the same size. The reason is reduced weaving that makes entering and exiting more predictable. Because there are only ten points of conflict (compared with 8 for a conventional single lane roundabout, or between 32 and 64 with traffic signal control), this design is often safer as well. Research and experiments show that traffic accidents are reduced by 72% on turbo roundabouts compared to multi-lane roundabouts, which have 12 points of conflict. Research at Windesheim University also shows that turbo roundabouts reduce accidents including casualties by some 75% when compared to regular intersections, and by 61% compared to single-lane roundabouts. The same research made it very clear that it is safer for cyclists not to have priority over motor vehicles on the roundabout, than to have it. At least 70 have been built in the Netherlands, while many turbos (or similar, lane splitting designs) can be found in southeast Asia. The turbo roundabout design is given as an example in the federal Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.

===Sub-sea roundabouts===
A new development is the roundabout below the seabed, in locations where multiple undersea traffic tunnels join. The first such roundabout is in the Eysturoy Tunnel (Eysturoyartunnilin), opened in December 2020 in the Faroe Islands. It connects the main island Streymoy with two locations on the island Eysturoy that are separated by a long fjord, Skálafjørður. So, three roads meet at this roundabout. Total length of the system is 11.24 km (6.98 mi). It was the largest ever infrastructure project in the Faroe Islands, estimated to have cost around a billion Danish kroner.

=== Motorways ===

Roundabouts are generally not appropriate for placement on motorway or freeway mainlines because the purpose of such facilities is to provide for uninterrupted traffic flow. However, roundabouts are often used for the junction between the slip roads (called &quot;ramps&quot; in North America) and the intersecting road. A single roundabout, grade separated from the mainlines, may be used to create a roundabout interchange. This type of junction is common in the UK and Ireland.

Alternatively, separate roundabouts also may be used at the slip road intersections of a diamond interchange to create what often is referred to as a &quot;dumbbell interchange&quot;, which is increasingly common in both Europe and North America due to its reduced need for wide or multiple bridges. A variation of the dumbbell interchange, often called a &quot;dogbone interchange&quot;, occurs when the roundabouts do not form a complete circle but are instead raindrop roundabouts (described above). This configuration reduces conflicts between vehicles entering the raindrop roundabouts from the ramps, reducing queueing and delays, compared with the dumbbell interchange.

Additional use of roundabouts for high-speed junctions is the 3-level stacked roundabout—this is a roundabout interchange where &quot;both&quot; of the roadway mainlines are grade separated. In the United Kingdom, the M25/A3, M8/M73 and A1(M)/M18 interchanges are examples of this type. These junctions, however, have less capacity than a full free-flow interchange. A similar design to this is the three-level diamond interchange.

Most junctions on Dublin&#x27;s M50 motorway C-road were built using a standard roundabout interchange. The traffic volume of several of these junctions increased to a level higher than the capacity such roundabouts can accommodate, and in turn, have been converted into partially or fully free-flowing interchanges. One example is the Red Cow interchange. In Northern Ireland, the junction between the M1 and M12 (Craigavon connector motorway) is via a standard roundabout with a raised centre, three onslips and three offslips, and two lanes.

In the city of Malmö, Sweden, a roundabout connects two motorways, E22 from Lund, and the Inner ring road.

In the Netherlands, A6 motorway and A7 motorway used to cross near Joure using a roundabout until October 2017, when the junction was turned into a full Y-interchange. The junction between the A200 and the A9 uses a 3-level stacked roundabout. Near Eindhoven (the Leenderheide junction), the junction for the A2 uses a roundabout. An overpass was built for the A67 from Antwerp to Germany.

Near Liège, Belgium, the Cheratte interchange between the A3/E40 and A25/E25 functions partially as a roundabout, with through traffic allowed to continue without entering the junction and traffic changing between motorways required to use the roundabout.

Rotary interchanges operate with traffic circles rather than roundabouts. Rotary interchanges are common in New England, particularly in the state of Massachusetts, but a European example of a rotary interchange may be found in Hinwil, Switzerland.

=== Signalised roundabouts ===
A signalised roundabout is one where one or more entry is controlled by traffic signals, rather than by assumed priority. For each signalised entry there will also be a signalised stopline immediately upstream on the circulatory section. The signals prevent blocking on the roundabout, and balance and improve traffic capacity.

Examples include the M50 in Dublin; the Cherry Street roundabout in Kowloon, Hong Kong; Sheriffhall Roundabout in Edinburgh, Scotland; Newton Circus in Singapore; and many of the roundabouts along the Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico City.

An evolution of the signalised roundabout has been proposed recently. It is based in avoiding stops by eliminating conflict points in roundabouts. This proposed new paradigm (SYROPS) forms platoons of vehicles (e.g. 2 x 3 cars) that arrive at the roundabout with speed identical to the average circulation speed in the roundabout and within the time interval (visualised as a rotating priority sector) assigned to his entrance, avoiding all the conflicts of passage and with it the stops and accelerations required in standard and in signalled roundabouts. Signalling signage is with lights for human drivers and optionally wireless for connected and autonomous vehicles.

=== &quot;Magic&quot; roundabouts/ring junctions ===

&quot;Magic roundabouts&quot; direct traffic in both directions around the central island. They are officially known as &quot;ring junctions&quot;. The first magic roundabout was constructed in 1972 in Swindon, Wiltshire, United Kingdom, designed by Frank Blackmore, inventor of the mini-roundabout. The roundabout joins five roads and consists of a two-way road around the central island, with five mini-roundabouts meeting the incoming roads.

The name derives from the popular children&#x27;s television series, &quot;The Magic Roundabout&quot;, and is considered &quot;magic&quot; because traffic flows in both clockwise and anticlockwise directions. This is achieved by surrounding the main island with one smaller roundabout per entry/exit street. This pattern directs traffic in the usual clockwise (in LHT installations) or counter-clockwise (in RHT installations) manner around each mini-roundabout. Exiting the mini-roundabouts, traffic may proceed around the central island either in the usual direction (via the outer loop), or in the inverse direction (the inner loop). The arrangement offers multiple paths between feeder roads. Drivers typically choose the shorter, most fluid route. Although the safety record is good, many drivers find this system intimidating, and some drivers go to great lengths to avoid them.

Similar systems are found in the Moor End roundabout in Hemel Hempstead (Hertfordshire), which has six intersections; in High Wycombe (Buckinghamshire), the Denham Roundabout in Denham (Buckinghamshire), the Greenstead Roundabout in Colchester (Essex), &quot;The Egg&quot; in Tamworth (Staffordshire) and the Hatton Cross Roundabout in London.

Churchbridge Junction in Staffordshire is a magic gyratory. This type of junction is similar to a magic roundabout, except that the constituent roundabouts are connected by longer lengths of roadway.

=== Dutch-style roundabouts for bicycles and pedestrians ===


=== Trams ===
Tram roundabouts, which are found in many countries, combine roundabouts for individual vehicles with tram lines. Large areas are needed for tram roundabouts that include a junction between tram lines. Tramways usually cross the centre of the roundabout. At busy junctions, this requires traffic lights or special signalling granting the trams priority. However, there are also roundabouts where trams and vehicles share the carriageway. Some roundabouts have a tram stop on the island.

*In France, tram roundabouts commonly have radii between 14 and 22 metres, although some have radii outside this range.
*In some cities, the tramway bisects the roundabout. The French considers that the mix of priorities makes these confusing and difficult to understand: a traditional modern roundabout gives the priority to the central ring, while tram roundabouts give priority to the central ring but higher priority still to the tramway. This generates many collisions of cars and trams, between 7 and 10 for each tram roundabout in France between 2006 and 2015 (between 0.37 and 1.01 per year).
*In inner Melbourne, particularly in the inner suburban area of South Melbourne, where the tram network is extensive, tram tracks always pass through the central island, with drivers required to give way to vehicles approaching from their right and to trams approaching from right angles. The Haymarket roundabout between Royal Parade and Elizabeth Street contains a tram-stop, pedestrian crossings, three entering tram lines, traffic signals to stop vehicular traffic at each crossing point when a tram is due, service roads and a pedestrian crossing.
*Brussels tram roundabouts employ multiple configurations. At the Barrière de St-Gilles (Dutch: ), tram tracks form a circle in the carriageway, while Churchill, Verboekhoven and Altitude Cent (&quot;Hoogte Honderd&quot;) have reserved tram tracks inside the roundabout. At Vanderkindere and Place Stéphanie (&quot;Stefaniaplein&quot;), they go straight through the centre, in the latter case with a slip track up the Chaussée de Charleroi (&quot;Charleroisesteenweg&quot;), while at Montgomery they tunnel underneath.
*In Dublin, Ireland, the Red Cow interchange at the N7/M50 junction is grade-separated and is signal-controlled with secondary lanes (separate from the main roundabout) for those making left turns. The junction, the busiest in Ireland, had tram lines added to it with the opening of the Luas system in 2004. The tracks pass across one carriageway of the N7, and across the southern M50 sliproads. Trams pass every five minutes at rush hour. The roundabout was replaced with a grade-separated free flowing junction.
*Gothenburg, Sweden has a tram roundabout at Mariaplan in the inner suburb of Majorna. The trams make a right turn, giving the roundabout an odd design.
*In Warsaw, trams typically cross straight through roundabouts and have junctions in the centre of them. In Wrocław, Poland, trams pass through the Powstańców Śląskich Roundabout, stopping in the roundabout (north-headed track).
*The Silesian tram network in Poland has two tram roundabouts. In the city centre of Katowice, the tram line passes through the centre of the Ziętka Roundabout in a north–south alignment, with a tram stop in the centre of the circle. In Będzin, unusually, the tram junction itself forms a circular roundabout, with trams going around the circle; there are tram stops immediately outside the roundabout on each branch.
*In Vítězné náměstí (Victory Square) in Prague, Czech Republic, a tramway crosses the carriage way of the roundabout at three places. Entering as well as leaving trams give way to vehicles. In the years 1932–42 trams circulated much like vehicles.
*In Kyiv, Ukraine an interchange of two &quot;fast tram&quot; lines is below a roundabout.
*Oslo, Norway also has many roundabouts with tram tracks passing through; for example at Bislett, Frogner plass, Sinsen, Solli plass, Carl Berners plass and Storo.
*In Wolverhampton, England, the West Midlands Metro tram passes through the centre of a roundabout on the approach to its terminus at St Georges. This also happens in New Addington in Croydon on the Tramlink north of King Henry&#x27;s Drive tram stop on Old Lodge Lane at the junction to King Henry&#x27;s Drive.
*In Sheffield, England the Sheffield Supertram systems crosses two major roundabouts. At the Brook Hill roundabout near Sheffield University, the tramway passes underneath the roundabout in a subway, while at Park Square in the city centre it travels above the roundabout on bridges and viaducts with a junction in the central island.
*A roundabout in southern Zagreb, Croatia features tram tracks passing through, curving at a 90° angle, as well as a full tram mini-roundabout inside the middle road island. In Croatia, where tram tracks enter the road without traffic lights, trams have the highest priority and other non-emergency vehicles are required to yield.
*In Salt Lake City, Utah a light rail line on the south side of the University of Utah crosses a roundabout where Guardsman Way meets South Campus Drive. Like virtually all rail crossings in the United States, both crossings in the circle are equipped with boom barriers.
*In Kassel, Germany, Lines 4 and 8 pass through the centre of the roundabout at Platz der Deutschen Einheit. The tram stops are in the centre of the roundabout. Roundabout traffic is controlled by traffic lights. Pedestrian access is via subway and street-level crossings at the lights.
*In Bremen, Germany, tram lines 8 and 6 pass through the centre of the roundabout &quot;Am Stern&quot; east of the main railway station. They enter from the west and exit in a northeastern direction, thus making a slight bend within the roundabout. Both stations are situated on the north-eastern edge of the roundabout. Traffic is controlled by two-colour traffic lights inside the roundabout.

=== Railways ===

In Jensen Beach, Florida, the main line of the Florida East Coast Railway running north–south bisects the two-lane roundabout at the junction of Jensen Beach Boulevard running east–west. It hosts three other roads and the service entrance to a large shopping plaza. Boom barriers line the railway crossings. The landscaped central island bisected by the tracks was originally curbed/kerbed, but 18-wheelers had trouble negotiating the roundabout, so the curbs were replaced with painted concrete strips. The roundabout was built in the early 2000s and improved traffic flow, although long freight trains often cause delays.

Two roundabouts in the Melbourne metropolitan area, Highett, Victoria and Hampton, have heavy rail crossing the roundabout and through the inner circle. Boom barriers protect the railway from oncoming traffic at the appropriate points in the roundabout.

At the Driescher Kreisel in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany, a railway serving a nearby paper factory crosses a roundabout located next to a shopping centre and pedestrian zone. The flow of traffic and pedestrians is governed by 14 barriers, 22 traffic lights and 8 loudspeakers. The barriers close three times daily for 7 minutes to allow trains to pass.

In New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, two roundabouts join major roads where a railway cuts through. One is at the intersection between (as Sinclair Street and Main Street from the east) and Main Street (from the west), Park Terrace and Redwood Street in the city of Blenheim. Here the Main North Line bisects the roundabout and separates Park Terrace and Main Street eastbound from the rest of the roundabout. The other roundabout is located at Kumara Junction on the West Coast, where the Hokitika Branch separates southbound from SH 6 northbound and . Both roundabouts are controlled by flashing red lights, with additional boom barriers at the Blenheim roundabout.

=== Through roundabout ===

Also known as a hamburger roundabout, these junctions are signalised and have a straight-through section of carriageway for one of the major routes. The &quot;hamburger&quot; name derives from the fact that the plan view resembles the cross-section through a hamburger. The United Kingdom has examples on the A580 East Lancashire Road in St Helens, on Haydock Island in Merseyside (which also features the M6 passing overhead), and on the Astley/Boothstown border. More examples are the A6003 at Kettering, the A538 near Manchester Airport, the &quot;Showcase&quot; junction on A329 at Winnersh, Berkshire and the A63/A1079 Mytongate junction in Hull. Examples also exist in Bracknell, Hull, Bramcote in Nottinghamshire and Reading, as well as on the N2/M50 intersection in Dublin, Ireland. In Perth, Western Australia, one is found at the intersection of Alexander Drive, Morley Drive and The Strand. Throughabouts are very common in Spain, where they are called &quot;raquetas&quot; (Spanish for racket&quot;) or &quot;glorieta/rotonda partida&quot; (&quot;split roundabout&quot;).

==== Only bicycle-pedestrian roundabouts ====
The same features that make roundabouts attractive for roadway junctions led to their use at junctions of multi-use trails.

The University of California, Davis and Stanford University, as well as the Cape Cod and Old Colony rail trails have bicycle-pedestrian roundabouts. A roundabout along the Clear Creek Trail in Bloomington, Indiana, connects the main trail to its spur.

Roundabouts are used on off-road bicycle trails in Florida, Colorado, Alaska, and Wisconsin.

An elevated roundabout is located in Eindhoven, serving pedestrian and bicycle traffic only, above the main conventional roadway intersection. It is known as the Hovenring.
