<text>Linda Carroll Hamilton (born September 26, 1956) is an American actress. Known for portraying tough, resilient characters, she made her film debut in 1979 before achieving fame with her starring role as Sarah Connor in &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984) and two of its sequels, &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot; (1991) and &quot;&quot; (2019). She is the recipient of various accolades, including two Saturn Awards, two MTV Movie Awards, a Satellite Award and a Romy Award, as well as nominations for three Golden Globes and one Primetime Emmy.

Hamilton&#x27;s other film credits include &quot;Children of the Corn&quot; (1984), &quot;Black Moon Rising&quot;, &quot;King Kong Lives&quot; (both 1986), &quot;Mr. Destiny&quot; (1990), &quot;Dante&#x27;s Peak&quot; (1997), and &quot;The Kid &amp; I&quot; (2005). On television, she starred as Catherine Chandler in &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; (1987–1989) and played the recurring role of Mary Elizabeth Bartowski on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Chuck&quot; (2010–2012). Her stage work includes &quot;Laura&quot; (Tiffany Theater, 2000) and &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; (Berkshire Theatre, 2006). Divorced from actor Bruce Abbott and director James Cameron, she has a child from each marriage.

==Early life==
Hamilton was born in Salisbury, Maryland, on September 26, 1956. Hamilton&#x27;s father (1928-1962) died when she was five; her mother (1931-2019) later married a police chief. Hamilton had an identical twin sister, Leslie Hamilton Freas (1956–2020), as well as one older sister, a younger brother, and a stepbrother. She has said that she was raised in a &quot;very boring, white Anglo-Saxon&quot; household, and that she &quot;voraciously read books&quot; in her spare time. Hamilton went to Wicomico Junior High and Wicomico High School in Salisbury.

She studied for two years at Washington College in Chestertown, Maryland, before moving on to acting studies in New York City. Hamilton has said that her acting professor at Washington College told her she had no hope of earning a living as an actress. In New York, she attended acting workshops given by Lee Strasberg.

==Career==
=== 1979–1983: Film debut and early roles ===
Hamilton made her professional debut at age 23 with a small part in the 1979 drama &quot;Night-Flowers&quot;. Her first major role came the following year when she appeared as Lisa Rogers on the short-lived CBS soap opera &quot;Secrets of Midland Heights&quot; (December 1980–January 1981). She appeared in her first starring film role in the low-budget thriller &quot;&quot; (1982), and co-starred that same year in the made-for-television movie &quot;Country Gold&quot;. She was listed as one of twelve &quot;Promising New Actors of 1982&quot; in John A. Willis&#x27; &quot;Screen World&quot;, Vol. 34.

=== 1984–1997: The &quot;Terminator&quot; franchise and television work ===
Hamilton made two prominent film appearances in 1984: firstly, a starring role in &quot;Children of the Corn&quot;, a horror film based on the short story by Stephen King. Hamilton played Vicky Baxter, a motorist who runs into trouble while travelling with her boyfriend through rural Nebraska. The film was financially profitable, making US$14 million at the domestic box office against a budget of US$3 million, but received generally negative reviews. In a more positive assessment by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Hamilton&#x27;s performance was praised. Her next role was co-starring in James Cameron&#x27;s science fiction action film &quot;The Terminator&quot; (1984) as Sarah Connor, a young waitress—and soon-to-be mother of a valiant resistance leader—who finds herself at the center of a nightmarish ordeal when a soldier travels back in time to help her defeat the titular cyborg assassin, sent from the future to execute her. The film was a surprise commercial hit, topping the U.S. box office for two weeks. Critics believed it to be a perfect example of its genre, with some attributing its strength to Hamilton&#x27;s performance; &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that she displayed &quot;tremendous resiliency&quot; as Connor, while Janet Maslin felt she played the part &quot;engrossingly&quot; in her review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. That same year, she guest-starred in four episodes of the NBC police drama &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;.

Following the success of &quot;The Terminator&quot;, Hamilton starred as car thief Nina in the action thriller &quot;Black Moon Rising&quot; (1986). Also that year, she guest-starred in an episode of &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; and headlined the big-budget adventure film &quot;King Kong Lives&quot;, a sequel to the 1976 remake of &quot;King Kong&quot;. The film was a moderate financial success but was universally panned by critics.

Hamilton&#x27;s next major role was that of savvy district attorney Catherine Chandler in the television series &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. A modern re-telling of the classic fairy tale, the show ran for three seasons on CBS between 1987 and 1990, though Hamilton requested to be written out during its third season when she fell pregnant. For her portrayal of Chandler, she won Austria&#x27;s Romy Award for Favorite Actress in a Series in 1990, as well as receiving Golden Globe and Emmy Award nominations in 1988 and 1989, respectively.

Hamilton returned to film with a starring role opposite in the 1990 fantasy-comedy &quot;Mr. Destiny&quot;. In her review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Sheila Benson believed that the film only worked because of &quot;Hamilton&#x27;s intrinsic warmth&quot;. The following year, she re-teamed with James Cameron to star in &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;. Reported at the time to be the most expensive motion picture ever made, it went on to gross over US$500 million worldwide; more than any other film that year. Of his decision to present a more troubled version of the Sarah Connor character, Cameron later reflected, &quot;It was all inspired by Linda really. I called her and said, &#x27;Hey, we&#x27;re [doing] another &quot;Terminator&quot;″. And she [replied], &#x27;I want to be crazy&#x27;. I said, &#x27;I can do that — I&#x27;ll put you in a mental hospital&#x27;. She said, &#x27;Perfect. That&#x27;s what I want&#x27;&quot;. Hamilton underwent intense physical training to emphasize the character&#x27;s transformation during the seven years since the first film. &quot;I hated [my trainer] most of the time&quot;, she later said; &quot;He would yell at me and throw tennis balls while I was shooting weapons blindfolded. I&#x27;d go off to the bathroom to cry for a minute, then I&#x27;d wipe away my tears and go back&quot;. Critics were impressed by Hamilton&#x27;s &quot;wild-eyed&quot; performance, with Derek Malcolm of &quot;The Guardian&quot; singling out her &quot;formidable sweaty intensity&quot;. She went on to receive two MTV Movie Awards and the 1991 Saturn Award for Best Actress for her portrayal of Connor, which has since been recognised as one of the most iconic female roles in cinematic history. Following the success of &quot;T2&quot;, she was invited to host an episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on November 16, 1991.

Hamilton&#x27;s subsequent film appearances were in the psychological thrillers &quot;Silent Fall&quot; (1994) and &quot;Separate Lives&quot; (1995). For her performance in the television movie &quot;A Mother&#x27;s Prayer&quot; (1995), where she played a widow diagnosed with AIDS, Hamilton received a CableACE Award and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Actress. On her decision to take the part, she said, &quot;So many people think I&#x27;m just this incredibly ferocious, fierce woman. Sarah Connor has sort of etched herself into my psyche and will never go away. So I chose [to play] this woman because she was a great balance of strength and frailty&quot;. She put herself on a strict diet in preparation for the role, saying, &quot;I had to know what it was like … I knew that I had to sort of sink in on myself. So I got very, very thin&quot;.

After guest-starring in an episode of &quot;Frasier&quot;, Hamilton played leading roles in two features that were released one week apart in 1997: political thriller &quot;Shadow Conspiracy&quot; and the big-budget action-adventure film &quot;Dante&#x27;s Peak&quot;. The latter proved to be one of the biggest commercial hits of the year, grossing US$180 million. Critics were mostly unimpressed by the film&#x27;s derivative narrative, but some praised the effects and performances, with Roger Ebert writing in his review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, &quot;In Brosnan and Hamilton [the filmmakers] have actors who play for realism and don&#x27;t go over the top&quot;. For her portrayal of small-town mayor Rachel Wando, Hamilton was named Best Actress at the following year&#x27;s Blockbuster Entertainment Awards. Speaking of her casting, she said, &quot;Police officers, military officers and lesbians. That was pretty much what I [used to get offered] and nothing else. [When I auditioned for director] Roger Donaldson, he literally said to me: &#x27;You&#x27;ve never played a part like this before&#x27; … And [I said], &#x27;What do you mean?&#x27; [He replied] &#x27;Normal.&#x27; He thought I couldn&#x27;t play normal! Jesus! It was just the way people thought [about me]&quot;.

=== 1998–2018: Stage, television, and film roles ===
Between 1998 and 1999, Hamilton appeared in a succession of voice roles in episodes of &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot;, &quot;Hercules&quot;, and &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;. Her next project was the Lifetime movie &quot;Sex &amp; Mrs. X&quot; (2000), where she played a magazine writer who experiences a sexual reawakening when she is assigned to interview an upper-class Parisian madam. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called it an &quot;[intriguing] character study that passes muster on the strength of good performances by [its leads]&quot;, adding that Hamilton was both &quot;tough&quot; and &quot;tender&quot; in the part. Later that year, she received a Satellite Award for Best Actress for her performance in the television film &quot;The Color of Courage&quot;, which &quot;Variety&quot; called &quot;excellent&quot;. She also headlined a production of &quot;Laura&quot;, an adaptation of the 1944 film noir of the same name, at California&#x27;s Tiffany Theater in December 2000. Hamilton received praise for her portrayal of the title character, with Jay Reiner of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; commenting:

The following year, Hamilton starred in the small-scale mystery thriller &quot;Skeletons in the Closet&quot; (2001), subsequently winning a DVD Exclusive Award for Best Supporting Actress. She then portrayed the real-life Ethel Rosenberg in &quot;Worse Than Murder: Ethel and Julius Rosenberg&quot;, admitting that her decision to &quot;transform myself into a tenement Jew from the Lower East Side&quot; had been a daunting one: &quot;I&#x27;m already prepared for the critics to be unkind to me, like, &#x27;Why is she playing a Jewish character&#x27; or &#x27;What&#x27;s she trying to do, prove she&#x27;s an actress?&#x27; But the fear is just part of the process&quot;. The play opened in May 2002—at the Ventura Theatre in California—to a rave review from &quot;Variety&quot;, who felt that Hamilton played her part with &quot;sumptuous veracity&quot;. Next, she had supporting roles in two films: the post-Vietnam war drama &quot;Missing in America&quot; (2005) and the Penelope Spheeris-directed comedy &quot;The Kid &amp; I&quot; (2005).

Hamilton&#x27;s portrayal of Maxine Faulk in the 2006 stage adaptation of &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; by Tennessee Williams was met with acclaim. Writing for &quot;Variety&quot;, Frank Rizzo said, &quot;[She is] well cast as the recently widowed but hardly mourning proprietress … She takes over the stage with natural assurance and plays this overripe survivor with lusty humor and cunning&quot;. The production ran between August 1–12 at the Berkshire Theatre in Stockbridge, Massachusetts.

Hamilton reprised the role of Sarah Connor for a second time with a voice cameo in 2009&#x27;s &quot;Terminator Salvation&quot;, which grossed US$371 million at the worldwide box office. In 2010, she joined the cast of NBC&#x27;s espionage-style comedy series &quot;Chuck&quot;, playing the recurring role of CIA agent Mary Elizabeth Bartowski. That same year, she guest-starred in three episodes of the Showtime dark comedy &quot;Weeds&quot;—as the marijuana supplier for the series&#x27; protagonist—and appeared as a &quot;cartoon American cop&quot; in the poorly received Irish film &quot;Holy Water&quot;.

In 2011, Hamilton narrated the Chiller network&#x27;s &quot;The Future of Fear&quot;, a documentary on the history of horror films. She then played a fictional U.S. president in the television miniseries &quot;Air Force One Is Down&quot; (2013), and had recurring roles as a bounty hunter on the Showcase series &quot;Lost Girl&quot; (2013) and a mentally ill mother on Syfy&#x27;s &quot;Defiance&quot; (2014–2015). Her next projects were the television pilot &quot;Shoot Me Nicely&quot; (2016), which was later released as a short film, and the small-scale science fiction film &quot;Curvature&quot; (2017). In his evaluation of the latter for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Frank Scheck described it as &quot;awfully loopy&quot;, adding, &quot;it&#x27;s always a pleasure to see Hamilton, even if it&#x27;s painfully obvious that she&#x27;s been cast [here] because of the genre resonance she brings to the table&quot;.

=== 2019–present: Return to mainstream projects ===
Hamilton returned once more to the &quot;Terminator&quot; franchise and the character of Sarah Connor when she headlined the Tim Miller-directed &quot;&quot;, set 25 years after the events of &quot;T2&quot;. She admitted to being reluctant to sign on to the project, having spent the previous few years away from the spotlight: &quot;I love my alone time like no one you&#x27;ve ever met … That was my hesitation: Do I want to trade this lovely, authentic life [that I&#x27;ve built] for that? I didn&#x27;t want my neighbours looking at me differently. We&#x27;re neighbors because of who we are, not what we do, and I don&#x27;t want that to creep into my life again&quot;.

Filming on &quot;Dark Fate&quot; took place in Hungary, Spain and the U.S. between May and November 2018. Though a financial disappointment, it received generally positive reviews upon its 2019 release, particularly for Hamilton&#x27;s performance. Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, David Fear felt that she provided the film&#x27;s &quot;sinew, heart, and soul&quot;, and said of her introduction:

Later that year, Hamilton was named Best Actress at the Los Angeles Crime and Horror Film Festival for her portrayal of &quot;King George&quot;—a ruthless crime boss—in &quot;Easy Does It&quot;, which &quot;Film Threat&quot; described as &quot;excellent … a throwback to grindhouse adventure films [and westerns]&quot;. She began appearing as General McCallister on Syfy&#x27;s &quot;Resident Alien&quot; in 2021, which &quot;IndieWire&quot; called a &quot;genre-bending … spry half-hour comedy [series]&quot;. Also that year, she guest-starred as a hippie life coach in six episodes of the TNT dark comedy &quot;Claws&quot; during its final season.

It was announced in June 2023 that Hamilton would join the ensemble of the Netflix mystery-horror series &quot;Stranger Things&quot; for its fifth and final season—due to air in 2025—as an unspecified character. A self-proclaimed fan of the show, she said of her casting, &quot;I don&#x27;t know how to be a fangirl and an actress at the same time. I&#x27;m going to work on that&quot;.

==Personal life==
Hamilton&#x27;s twin sister, Leslie, died on August 22, 2020, at the age of 63. Leslie appeared as Linda&#x27;s double in a few scenes of &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, including the scene in which the T-1000 disguises itself as Sarah Connor. Hamilton has described herself politically as a Democrat, but she voted for Republican candidate Arnold Schwarzenegger—her &quot;Terminator&quot; co-star—in the 2003 California election after his campaign convinced her he was suitable for the job. While filming &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, Hamilton suffered permanent hearing damage in one ear because she had forgotten to put in her earplugs for a scene which called for Schwarzenegger to fire a shotgun inside an elevator.

=== Marriage and relationships ===
Hamilton has been married and divorced twice. Her first marriage was to actor Bruce Abbott, from 1982 to 1989. He left Hamilton when she was pregnant with their son Dalton, who was born in 1989. She later stated Abbott departed due to her mood swings and physical abuse towards him stemming from bipolar disorder, and she publicly apologized to him in 2004. 

In 1991, Hamilton began a relationship and moved in with film director James Cameron after filming &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;. They had a daughter, born in 1993. Hamilton said she experienced postpartum depression after the birth of her second child. Hamilton and Cameron briefly separated when Cameron was filming &quot;Titanic&quot; (1997) and he began a relationship with actress Suzy Amis, who played a small role in the film. Hamilton and Cameron later got back together and married in 1997; this ended in a $50 million divorce settlement for Hamilton in 1999. 

In a 2019 interview for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Hamilton said she had been celibate for &quot;at least 15 years&quot;. &quot;One loses track, because it just doesn&#x27;t matter — or at least it doesn&#x27;t matter to me. I have a very romantic relationship with my world every day and the people who are in it,&quot; she said.

=== Mental health ===
Hamilton started to binge eat when she entered high school. After seeing a psychologist for the first time at the age of 22 in 1978–1979, she thought acting would help her feel better, but she ended up having a breakdown in the beginning of her acting career and turned to drugs and alcohol use and self-medicated with cocaine in order to get her confidence up. In an October 2005 appearance on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, Hamilton discussed her depression and bipolar disorder, which led to violent mood swings and suicidal thoughts during her marriage to Abbott and, in her view, caused the failure of both her marriages. She also discussed how she eventually received therapy and medication to manage the condition.

<text>Erich Maria Remarque (; ; born Erich Paul Remark; 22 June 1898 – 25 September 1970) was a German novelist. His landmark novel &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1928), based on his experience in the Imperial German Army during World War I, was an international bestseller which created a new literary genre of veterans writing about conflict. The book was adapted to film several times. Remarque&#x27;s anti-war themes led to his condemnation by Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels as &quot;unpatriotic&quot;. He was able to use his literary success and fame to relocate to Switzerland as a refugee, and to the United States, where he became a naturalized citizen.

==Early life==
Remarque was born on 22 June 1898, as Erich Paul Remark, to Peter Franz Remark and Anna Maria (), a working-class Roman Catholic family in Osnabrück. He was never close with his father, a bookbinder, but he was close with his mother and he began using the middle name Maria after World War I in her honor. Remarque was the third of four children of Peter and Anna. His siblings were his older sister Erna, older brother Theodor Arthur (who died at the age of five or six), and younger sister Elfriede.

The spelling of his last name was changed to Remarque when he published &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; in honor of his French ancestors and in order to disassociate himself from his earlier novel &quot;The Dream Room&quot; (). His grandfather had changed the spelling from Remarque to Remark in the 19th century. Research by Remarque&#x27;s childhood and lifelong friend Hanns-Gerd Rabe proved that Remarque had French ancestors his great-grandfather Johann Adam Remarque, who was born in 1789, came from a French family in Aachen. This is contrary to the falsehood perpetuated by Nazi propaganda that his real last name was Kramer (&quot;Remark&quot; spelled backwards) and that he was Jewish.

==Military service==
During World War I, Remarque was conscripted into the Imperial German Army at the age of 18. On 12 June 1917, he was transferred to the Western Front, 2nd Company, Reserves, Field Depot of the 2nd Guards Reserve Division at Hem-Lenglet. On 26 June 1917 he was posted to the 15th Reserve Infantry Regiment, 2nd Company, Engineer Platoon Bethe, and fought in the trenches between Torhout and Houthulst. On 31 July 1917 he was wounded by shell shrapnel in his left leg, right arm and neck, and after being medically evacuated from the field was repatriated to an army hospital in Duisburg, where he recovered from his wounds. In October 1918, he was recalled to military service, but the war&#x27;s armistice a month later put an end to his military career.

==Post-war employment==
After the war he continued his teacher training and worked from 1 August 1919 as a primary-school teacher in Lohne, at that time in the county of Lingen, now in the county of Bentheim. From May 1920 he worked in Klein Berssen in the former County of Hümmling, now Emsland, and from August 1920 in Nahne, which has been a part of Osnabrück since 1972. On 20 November 1920 he applied for leave of absence from teaching. 

He worked at a number of different jobs in this phase of his life, including librarian, businessman, journalist, and editor. His first paid writing job was as a technical writer for the Continental Rubber Company, a German tire manufacturer.

==Writing career==
Remarque had made his first attempts at writing at the age of 16. Among them were essays, poems, and the beginnings of a novel that was finished later and published in 1920 as &quot;The Dream Room&quot; (). Between 1923 and 1926 he also scripted a comic series, , drawn by Hermann Schütz, published in the magazine &quot;Echo Continental&quot;, a publication by the rubber and tire company Continental AG.

After coming back from the war, the atrocities of war along with his mother&#x27;s death caused him a great deal of mental trauma and grief. In later years as a professional writer, he started using &quot;Maria&quot; as his middle name instead of &quot;Paul&quot;, to commemorate his mother. When he published &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, he had his surname reverted to an earlier spelling from Remark to Remarque to disassociate himself from his novel .

In 1927, he published the novel &quot;Station at the Horizon&quot; (). It was serialised in the sports journal for which Remarque was working. (It was first published in book form in 1998.) &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; () (1929), his career-defining work, was also written in 1927. Remarque was at first unable to find a publisher for it. Its text described the experiences of German soldiers during World War I. On publication it became an international bestseller and a landmark work in twentieth-century literature. It inspired a new genre of veterans writing about conflict, and the commercial publication of a wide variety of war memoirs. It also inspired dramatic representations of the war in theatre and cinema, in Germany as well as in countries that had fought in the conflict against the German Empire, particularly the United Kingdom and the United States.
Riding on the tail of the success of &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, a number of similar works followed from Remarque. In simple, emotive language, they described wartime and the postwar years in Germany. In 1931, after finishing &quot;The Road Back&quot; (), he bought a villa (Casa Monte Tabor) in Ronco, Switzerland with the substantial financial wealth that his published works had brought him. He planned to live both there and in France.

On 10 May 1933, at the initiative of the Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels, Remarque&#x27;s writing was publicly declared as &quot;unpatriotic&quot; and was banned in Germany. Copies were removed from all libraries and restricted from being sold or published anywhere in the country.

Germany was rapidly descending into a totalitarian society, leading to mass arrests of elements of the population of which the new governing order disapproved. Remarque left Germany to live at his villa in Switzerland. His French background as well as his Catholic faith were also publicly attacked by the Nazis. They continued to decry his writings in his absence, proclaiming that anyone who would change the spelling of his name from the German &quot;Remark&quot; to the French &quot;Remarque&quot; could not be a true German. The Nazis further made the false claim that Remarque had not seen active service during World War I. In 1938, Remarque&#x27;s German citizenship was revoked. In 1939, he and his ex-wife were remarried to prevent her repatriation to Germany. Just before the outbreak of World War II in Europe, they left Porto Ronco, Switzerland, for the United States. They became naturalised citizens of the United States in 1947.

Remarque continued to write about the German experience after WWI. His next novel, &quot;Three Comrades&quot; (), focuses on life in Weimar Republic in the years of 1928 and 1929. His fourth novel, &quot;Flotsam&quot; (in German titled , or &quot;Love Thy Neighbour&quot;), first appeared in a serial version in English translation in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine in 1939. He spent another year revising the text for its book publication in 1941, both in English and German. His next work, the novel &quot;Arch of Triumph&quot;, was first published in 1945 in English, and the next year in German as . Another instant bestseller, it reached worldwide sales of nearly five million. His final novel was &quot;Shadows in Paradise&quot;. He wrote it while living at 320 East 57th Street in New York City. The apartment building &quot;played a prominent role in his novel&quot;.

In 1943, the Nazis arrested his youngest sister, Elfriede Scholz, who had stayed behind in Germany with her husband and two children. After a trial at the notorious (Hitler&#x27;s extra-constitutional &quot;People&#x27;s Court&quot;), she was found guilty of &quot;undermining morale&quot; for stating that she considered the war lost. Court President Roland Freisler declared, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Your brother is unfortunately beyond our reach you, however, will not escape us.&quot;) Scholz was beheaded on 16 December 1943. Remarque later said that his sister had been involved in anti-Nazi resistance activities.

In exile, Remarque was unaware of his sister Elfriede&#x27;s fate until after the war. He would dedicate his 1952 novel &quot;Spark of Life&quot; () to her. The dedication was omitted in the German version of the book, reportedly because she was still seen as a traitor by some Germans.

==Later years==

In 1948, Remarque returned to Switzerland, where he spent the remainder of his life. There was a gap of seven years a long silence for Remarque between &quot;Arch of Triumph&quot; and his next work, &quot;Spark of Life&quot; (), which appeared both in German and in English in 1952. While he was writing &quot;The Spark of Life&quot; he was also working on a novel (&quot;Time to Live and Time to Die&quot;). It was published first in English translation in 1954 with the not-quite-literal title &quot;A Time to Love and a Time to Die&quot;. In 1958, Douglas Sirk directed the film &quot;A Time to Love and a Time to Die&quot; in Germany, based on Remarque&#x27;s novel. Remarque appeared in the film as an honorable teacher in hiding from the Nazis.

In 1955, Remarque wrote the screenplay for an Austrian film &quot;The Last Act&quot; (), about Hitler&#x27;s final days in the bunker of the Reich Chancellery in Berlin, which was based on the book &quot;Ten Days to Die&quot; (1950) by Michael Musmanno. In 1956, Remarque wrote a drama &quot;Full Circle&quot; () for the stage, which played in both Germany and on Broadway. An English translation was published in 1974. &quot;Heaven Has No Favorites&quot; was serialised (as &quot;Borrowed Life&quot;) in 1959 before appearing as a book in 1961 and was made into the 1977 film &quot;Bobby Deerfield&quot;. &quot;The Night in Lisbon&quot; (), published in 1962, is the last work Remarque finished. The novel sold about 900,000 copies in Germany.

==Personal life==

Remarque&#x27;s first marriage was to the actress Ilse Jutta Zambona in 1925. The marriage was stormy, and unfaithful on both sides. Remarque and Zambona divorced in 1930, but in 1933 they fled together to Switzerland. In 1938, they remarried, to prevent her from being forced to return to Germany, and in 1939 they emigrated to the United States, where they both became naturalized citizens in 1947. They divorced again on 20 May 1957, this time for good. Ilse Remarque died on 25 June 1975.

During the 1930s, Remarque had relationships with Austrian actress Hedy Lamarr, Mexican actress Dolores del Río, and German actress Marlene Dietrich. The affair with Dietrich began in September 1937, when they met on the Lido while in Venice for the film festival, and continued until at least 1940, maintained mostly by way of letters, telegrams and telephone calls. A selection of their letters was published in 2003 in the book (&quot;Tell Me That You Love Me&quot;) and then in the 2011 play &quot;Puma&quot;.

Remarque married actress Paulette Goddard in 1958.

==Death and legacy==
Remarque died of heart failure at the age of 72 in Locarno on 25 September 1970. His body was buried in the Ronco Cemetery in Ronco, Ticino, Switzerland. 

Goddard, Remarque&#x27;s wife, died in 1990, and her body was interred next to her husband&#x27;s. She left a bequest of US$20 million to New York University to fund an institute for European studies, which is named in honour of Remarque, as well as funding &quot;Goddard Hall&quot; on the Greenwich Village campus in New York City.

 The first director of The Remarque Institute was Professor Tony Judt. Remarque&#x27;s papers are housed at NYU&#x27;s Fales Library.

After Erich Maria Remarque&#x27;s death in 1970, his wife Paulette Goddard lived in the villa until her death in 1990. The villa was bequeathed to New York University as part of the estate of Paulette Goddard. Since New York University was not prepared to pay the associated inheritance tax of 18 million Swiss francs to the Canton of Ticino, the villa was confiscated by the canton.

The canton offered the villa at an auction around 2010, but there was initially no buyer, probably due to the high price and the high costs of modernizing the property. However by 2021, the property was finally purchased by a German couple who wish to preserve Casa Monte Tabor as a place to promote peace and preserve the legacy of Erich Maria Remarque. It will continue to be used for events on peace topics. The villa has been extensively renovated in 2023.

<text>Spontaneous human combustion (SHC) is the pseudoscientific concept of the spontaneous combustion of a living (or recently deceased) human body without an apparent external source of ignition on the body. In addition to reported cases, descriptions of the alleged phenomenon appear in literature, and both types have been observed to share common characteristics in terms of circumstances and the remains of the victim.

Scientific investigations have attempted to analyze reported instances of SHC and have resulted in hypotheses regarding potential causes and mechanisms, including victim behavior and habits, alcohol consumption, and proximity to potential sources of ignition, as well as the behavior of fires that consume melted fats. Natural explanations, as well as unverified natural phenomena, have been proposed to explain reports of SHC. The current scientific consensus is that purported cases of SHC involve overlooked external sources of ignition.

== Overview ==
&quot;Spontaneous human combustion&quot; refers to the death from a fire originating without an apparent external source of ignition: a belief that the fire starts within the body of the victim. This idea and the term &quot;spontaneous human combustion&quot; were both first proposed in 1746 by Paul Rolli, a Fellow of the Royal Society, in an article published in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions&quot; concerning the mysterious death of Countess Cornelia Zangheri Bandi. Writing in &quot;The British Medical Journal&quot; in 1938, coroner Gavin Thurston describes the phenomenon as having &quot;apparently attracted the attention not only of the medical profession but of the non-medical professionals one hundred years ago&quot; (referring to a fictional account published in 1834 in the Frederick Marryat cycle). In his 1995 book &quot;Ablaze!&quot;, Larry E. Arnold, a director of ParaScience International, wrote that there had been about 200 cited reports of spontaneous human combustion worldwide over a period of around 300 years.

=== Characteristics ===
The topic received coverage in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; in 1938. An article by L. A. Parry cited an 1823-published book &quot;Medical Jurisprudence&quot;, which stated that commonalities among recorded cases of spontaneous human combustion included the following characteristics:
Alcoholism is a common theme in early SHC literary references, in part because some Victorian era physicians and writers believed spontaneous human combustion was the result of alcoholism.

== Scientific investigation ==

An extensive two-and-a-half-year research project, involving 30 historical cases of alleged SHC from 1725 to 1982, was conducted by science investigator Joe Nickell and forensic analyst John F. Fischer. Their lengthy, two-part report was published in 1984 in the journal of the International Association of Arson Investigators, and incorporated into their 1988 book &quot;Secrets of the Supernatural&quot;. Nickell has written frequently on the subject, appeared on television documentaries, conducted additional research, and lectured at the New York State Academy of Fire Science at Montour Falls, New York, as a guest instructor.

The Nickell and Fischer investigation, which looked at cases in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, showed that the burned cadavers were close to plausible sources for the ignition: candles, lamps, fireplaces, and so on. Such sources were often omitted from published accounts of these incidents, presumably to deepen the aura of mystery surrounding an apparently &quot;spontaneous&quot; death. The investigations also found that there was a correlation between alleged SHC deaths and the victim&#x27;s intoxication (or other forms of incapacitation) which could conceivably have caused them to be careless and unable to respond properly to an accident. Where the destruction of the body was not particularly extensive, a primary source of combustible fuel could plausibly have been the victim&#x27;s clothing or a covering such as a blanket or comforter.

However, where the destruction was extensive, additional fuel sources were involved, such as chair stuffing, floor coverings, the flooring itself, and the like. The investigators described how such materials helped to retain melted fat, which caused more of the body to be burned and destroyed, yielding still more liquified fat, in a cyclic process known as the &quot;wick effect&quot; or the &quot;candle effect&quot;.

According to the Nickell and Fischer investigation, nearby objects often remained undamaged because fire tends to burn upwards, but burns laterally with some difficulty. The fires in question are relatively small, achieving considerable destruction by the wick effect, and nearby objects may not be close enough to catch fire themselves (much as one can closely approach a modest campfire without burning). As with other mysteries, Nickell and Fischer cautioned against a &quot;single, simplistic explanation for all unusual burning deaths&quot; but rather urged investigating &quot;on an individual basis&quot;. Neurologist Steven Novella has said that skepticism about spontaneous human combustion is now bleeding over into becoming popular skepticism about spontaneous combustion.

In a 2002 study, Angi M. Christensen of the University of Tennessee cremated both healthy and osteoporotic samples of human bone and compared the resulting color changes and fragmentation. The study found that osteoporotic bone samples &quot;consistently displayed more discoloration and a greater degree of fragmentation than healthy ones.&quot; The same study found that when human tissue is burned, the resulting flame produces a small amount of heat, indicating that fire is unlikely to spread from burning tissue.

== Suggested explanations ==
The scientific consensus is that incidents which might appear as &quot;spontaneous&quot; combustion did in fact have an external source of ignition, and that spontaneous human combustion without an external ignition source is extremely implausible. Pseudoscientific hypotheses have been presented which attempt to explain how SHC might occur without an external flame source. Benjamin Radford, science writer and deputy editor of the science magazine &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;, casts doubt on the plausibility of spontaneous human combustion: &quot;If SHC is a real phenomenon (and not the result of an elderly or infirm person being too close to a flame source), why doesn&#x27;t it happen more often? There are 8 billion people in the world [ ⁠today in 2024⁠], and yet we don&#x27;t see reports of people bursting into flame while walking down the street, attending football games, or sipping a coffee at a local Starbucks.&quot;

=== Natural explanations ===
* Almost all postulated cases of SHC involve people with low mobility due to advanced age or obesity, along with poor health. Victims show a high likelihood of having died in their sleep, or of having been unable to move once they had caught fire.
* Smoking is often seen as the source of fire. Natural causes such as heart attacks may lead to the victim dying, subsequently dropping the cigarette, which after a period of smouldering can ignite the victim&#x27;s clothes.
* The &quot;wick effect&quot; hypothesis suggests that a small external flame source, such as a burning cigarette, chars the clothing of the victim at a location, splitting the skin and releasing subcutaneous fat, which is in turn absorbed into the burned clothing, acting as a wick. This combustion can continue for as long as the fuel is available. This hypothesis has been successfully tested with pig tissue and is consistent with evidence recovered from cases of human combustion. The human body typically has enough stored energy in fat and other chemical stores to fully combust the body; even lean people have several pounds of fat in their tissues. This fat, once heated by the burning clothing, wicks into the clothing much as candle wax is drawn into a lit candle wick, providing the fuel needed to keep the wick burning. The protein in the body also burns, but provides less energy than fat, with the water in the body being the main impediment to combustion. However, slow combustion, lasting hours, gives the water time to evaporate slowly. In an enclosed area, such as a house, this moisture will recondense nearby, possibly on windows. Feet don&#x27;t typically burn because they often have the least fat; hands also have little fat, but may burn if resting on the abdomen, which provides all of the necessary fat for combustion.
* Scalding can cause burn-like injuries, sometimes leading to death, without setting fire to clothing. Although not applicable in cases where the body is charred and burnt, this has been suggested as a cause in at least one claimed SHC-like event.
* Brian J. Ford has suggested that ketosis, possibly caused by alcoholism or low-carb dieting, produces acetone, which is highly flammable and could therefore lead to apparently spontaneous combustion.
* SHC can be confused with self-immolation as a form of suicide. In the West, self-immolation accounts for 1% of suicides, while Radford claims in developing countries the figure can be as high as 40%.
* Sometimes there are reasonable explanations for the deaths, but proponents ignore official autopsies and contradictory evidence in favor of anecdotal accounts and personal testimonies.
* Inhaling/digesting phosphorus in different forms may lead to the formation of phosphine, which can autoignite.

=== Alternative hypotheses ===
* Larry E. Arnold in his 1995 book &quot;Ablaze!&quot; proposed a pseudoscientific new subatomic particle, which he called &quot;pyrotron&quot;. Arnold also wrote that the flammability of a human body could be increased by certain circumstances, like increased alcohol in the blood. He further proposed that extreme stress could be the trigger that starts many combustions. This process may use no external oxygen to spread throughout the body, since it may not be an &quot;oxidation-reduction&quot; reaction; however, no reaction mechanism has been proposed. Researcher Joe Nickell has criticised Arnold&#x27;s hypotheses as based on selective evidence and argument from ignorance.
* In his 1976 book &quot;Fire from Heaven&quot;, UK writer Michael Harrison suggests that SHC is connected to poltergeist activity because, he argues, &quot;the force which activates the &#x27;poltergeist&#x27; originates in, and is supplied by, a human being&quot;. Within the concluding summary, Harrison writes: &quot;SHC, fatal or non-fatal, belongs to the extensive range of poltergeist phenomena.&quot;
* John Abrahamson suggested that ball lightning could account for spontaneous human combustion. &quot;This is circumstantial only, but the charring of human limbs seen in a number of ball lightning cases are [sic] very suggestive that this mechanism may also have occurred where people have had limbs combusted,&quot; says Abrahamson.

== Examples ==

On 2 July 1951, Mary Reeser, a 67-year-old woman, was found burned to death in her house after her landlady realised that the house&#x27;s doorknob was unusually warm. The landlady notified the police, and upon entering the home they found Reeser&#x27;s remains completely burned into ash, with only one leg remaining. The chair she was sitting in was also destroyed. Reeser took sleeping pills and was also a smoker. Despite its proliferation in popular culture, the contemporary FBI investigation ruled out the possibility of SHC. A common theory was that she was smoking a cigarette after taking sleeping pills and then fell asleep while still holding the burning cigarette, which could have ignited her gown, ultimately leading to her death. Her daughter-in-law stated, &quot;The cigarette dropped to her lap. Her fat was the fuel that kept her burning. The floor was cement, and the chair was by itself. There was nothing around her to burn&quot;.

Margaret Hogan, an 89-year-old widow who lived alone in a house on Prussia Street, Dublin, Ireland, was found burned almost to the point of complete destruction on 28 March 1970. Plastic flowers on a table in the centre of the room had been reduced to liquid and a television with a melted screen sat 12 feet from the armchair in which the ashen remains were found; otherwise, the surroundings were almost untouched. Her two feet, and both legs from below the knees, were undamaged. A small coal fire had been burning in the grate when a neighbour left the house the previous day; however, no connection between this fire and that in which Mrs. Hogan died could be found. An inquest, held on 3 April 1970, recorded death by burning, with the cause of the fire listed as &quot;unknown&quot;.

On 24 November 1979, during Thanksgiving weekend, Beatrice Oczki, a 51-year-old woman, was found charred to death in her home in the village of Bolingbrook, Illinois, United States.

Henry Thomas, a 73-year-old man, was found burned to death in the living room of his council house on the Rassau estate in Ebbw Vale, South Wales, in 1980. Most of his body was incinerated, leaving only his skull and part of each leg below the knee. The feet and legs were still clothed in socks and trousers. Half of the chair in which he had been sitting was also destroyed. Police forensic officers decided that the incineration of Thomas was due to the wick effect.

In December 2010, the death of Michael Faherty, a 76-year-old man in County Galway, Ireland, was recorded as &quot;spontaneous combustion&quot; by the coroner. The doctor, Ciaran McLoughlin, made this statement at the inquiry into the death: &quot;This fire was thoroughly investigated and I&#x27;m left with the conclusion that this fits into the category of spontaneous human combustion, for which there is no adequate explanation.&quot;

&quot;The Skeptic&quot; magazine ascribed to possible SHC the 1899 case of two children from the same family who were burned to death in different places at the same time. The evidence showed that although the coincidence seemed strange, the children both loved to play with fire and had been &quot;whipped&quot; for this behavior in the past. Looking at all the evidence, the coroner and jury ruled that these were both accidental deaths.

== In popular culture ==
* Charles Brockden Brown&#x27;s 1798 novel &quot;Wieland: or, The Transformation: An American Tale&quot; features the death of the Wieland family&#x27;s patriarch via spontaneous human combustion during prayer within his property&#x27;s temple.
* In the novel &quot;Redburn&quot; by Herman Melville published in 1849, a sailor, Miguel Saveda, is consumed by &quot;animal combustion&quot; while in a drunken stupor on the return voyage from Liverpool to New York.
* In the novel &quot;Bleak House&quot; by Charles Dickens, the character Mr. Krook dies of spontaneous combustion at the end of Part X. Dickens researched the details of a number of contemporary accounts of spontaneous human combustion before writing that part of the novel and, after receiving criticism from a scientist friend suggesting he was perpetuating a &quot;vulgar error&quot;, cites some of these cases in Part XI and again in the preface to the one-volume edition. The death of Mr. Krook has been described as &quot;the most famous case in literature&quot; of spontaneous human combustion.
* In the comic story &quot;The Glenmutchkin Railway&quot; by William Edmondstoune Aytoun, published in 1845 in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, one of the railway directors, Sir Polloxfen Tremens, is said to have died of spontaneous combustion.
* In the 1984 mockumentary &quot;This Is Spın̈al Tap&quot;, about the fictional heavy metal band Spinal Tap, two of the band&#x27;s former drummers are said to have died in separate on-stage spontaneous human combustion incidents.
* In the episode &quot;Confidence and Paranoia&quot; of British science fiction series &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;, a character called the Mayor of Warsaw is said to have spontaneously exploded in the 16th century and briefly appears in a vision by an unconscious Lister (the main protagonist of the series) where he explodes in front of Rimmer (his hologram bunkmate).
* In the beginning of the 1998 video game &quot;Parasite Eve&quot;, an entire audience in Carnegie Hall spontaneously combusts (except for Aya Brea, the protagonist of the game) during an opera presentation as the main actress Melissa Pierce starts to sing.
* This phenomenon is mentioned in the TV series &quot;The X-Files&quot;. 
* In the episode &quot;Heart Break&quot; of the second season of the American action police procedural television series &quot;NCIS&quot;, a case is investigated where the victim at first glance seems to have been killed by spontaneous human combustion.
* In episode &quot;Duty Free Rome&quot; of the second season of the TV series &quot;Picket Fences&quot;, the town&#x27;s mayor is shown to have been killed by spontaneous combustion.
* In the seventh season episode “Mars Attacks” of the American TV medical drama &quot;ER&quot;, a patient is treated for “spontaneous human combustion” and subsequently catches fire.
* The manga and anime series &quot;Fire Force (En&#x27;en no Shōbōtai)&quot; focuses on the main protagonists fighting humans who have this phenomenon.
* In the fourth episode of the first season of the English comedic drama series &quot;Toast of London&quot;, Toast decides to finish his book by having the main character spontaneously combust. When bringing it to his literary agent, the laziness of his ending enrages her to the point of spontaneous combustion in front of Toast.
* The adult animated series &quot;South Park&quot; devoted a whole episode, titled &quot;Spontaneous Combustion&quot;, to spontaneous human combustion.
*In Kevin Wilson&#x27;s short story &quot;Blowing Up on the Spot&quot; (from his collection &quot;Tunneling to the Center of the Earth&quot;), the protagonist&#x27;s parents died from a &quot;double spontaneous human combustion.&quot;
*In the 2020 American black comedy horror film &quot;Spontaneous&quot;, high school students at Covington High begin to inexplicably explode.
*In the fifth and sixth episode of the anime &quot;Ameku M.D.: Doctor Detective&quot;, Takao investigates a case in which two of the victims seem to have died of spontaneous combustion, due to &quot;Enzou&#x27;s curse&quot;.

<text>Horatio Alger Jr. (; January 13, 1832 – July 18, 1899) was an American author who wrote young adult novels about impoverished boys and their rise from humble backgrounds to middle-class security and comfort through good works. His writings were characterized by the &quot;rags-to-riches&quot; narrative, which had a formative effect on the United States from 1868 through to his death in 1899.

Alger secured his literary niche in 1868 with the publication of his fourth book, &quot;Ragged Dick&quot;, the story of a poor bootblack&#x27;s rise to middle-class respectability. This novel was a huge success. His many books that followed were essentially variations on &quot;Ragged Dick&quot; and featured stock characters: the valiant, hardworking, honest youth; the noble mysterious stranger; the snobbish youth; and the evil, greedy squire. In the 1870s, Alger&#x27;s fiction was growing stale. His publisher suggested he tour the Western United States for fresh material to incorporate into his fiction. Alger took a trip to California, but the trip had little effect on his writing: he remained mired in the staid theme of &quot;poor boy makes good&quot;. The backdrops of these novels, however, became the Western United States, rather than the urban environments of the Northeastern United States.

==Biography==

=== Childhood: 1832–1847 ===
Alger was born on January 13, 1832, in Chelsea, Massachusetts, the son of Horatio Alger Sr., a Unitarian minister, and Olive Augusta Fenno.

He had many connections with the New England Puritan aristocracy of the early 19th century. He was the descendant of Pilgrim Fathers Robert Cushman, Thomas Cushman, and William Bassett. He was also the descendant of Sylvanus Lazell, a Minuteman and brigadier general in the War of 1812, and Edmund Lazell, a member of the Constitutional Convention in 1788.

Alger&#x27;s siblings Olive Augusta and James were born in 1833 and 1836, respectively. A disabled sister, Annie, was born in 1840, and a brother, Francis, in 1842. Alger was a precocious boy afflicted with myopia and asthma, but Alger Sr. decided early that his eldest son would one day enter the ministry. To that end, Alger&#x27;s father tutored him in classical studies and allowed him to observe the responsibilities of ministering to parishioners.

Alger began attending Chelsea Grammar School in 1842, but by December 1844 his father&#x27;s financial troubles had worsened considerably. In search of a better salary, he moved the family to Marlborough, Massachusetts, an agricultural town 25 miles west of Boston, where he was installed as pastor of the Second Congregational Society in January 1845 with a salary sufficient to meet his needs. Alger attended Gates Academy, a local preparatory school, and completed his studies at age 15. He published his earliest literary works in local newspapers.

=== Harvard and early works: 1848–1864 ===
In July 1848, Alger passed the Harvard entrance examinations and was admitted to the class of 1852. The 14-member, full-time Harvard faculty included Louis Agassiz and Asa Gray (sciences), Cornelius Conway Felton (classics), James Walker (religion and philosophy), and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow (belles-lettres). Edward Everett served as president. Alger&#x27;s classmate Joseph Hodges Choate described Harvard at this time as &quot;provincial and local because its scope and outlook hardly extended beyond the boundaries of New England; besides which it was very denominational, being held exclusively in the hands of Unitarians&quot;.

Alger thrived in the highly disciplined and regimented Harvard environment, winning scholastic and other prestigious awards. His genteel poverty and less-than-aristocratic heritage, however, barred him from membership in the Hasty Pudding Club and the Porcellian Club. In 1849, he became a professional writer when he sold two essays and a poem to the &quot;Pictorial National Library&quot;, a Boston magazine. He began reading Walter Scott, James Fenimore Cooper, Herman Melville, and other modern writers of fiction and cultivated a lifelong love for Longfellow, whose verse he sometimes employed as a model for his own. He was chosen Class Odist and graduated with Phi Beta Kappa Society honors in 1852, eighth in a class of 88.

Alger had no job prospects following graduation and returned home. He continued to write, submitting his work to religious and literary magazines, with varying success. He briefly attended Harvard Divinity School in 1853, possibly to be reunited with a romantic interest, but he left in November 1853 to take a job as an assistant editor at the &quot;Boston Daily Advertiser&quot;. He loathed editing and quit in 1854 to teach at The Grange, a boys&#x27; boarding school in Rhode Island. When The Grange suspended operations in 1856, Alger found employment directing the 1856 summer session at Deerfield Academy.

His first book, &quot;Bertha&#x27;s Christmas Vision: An Autumn Sheaf&quot;, a collection of short pieces, was published in 1856, and his second book, &quot;Nothing to Do: A Tilt at Our Best Society&quot;, a lengthy satirical poem, was published in 1857. He attended Harvard Divinity School from 1857 to 1860 and, upon graduation, toured Europe. In the spring of 1861, he returned to a nation in the throes of the Civil War. Exempted from military service for health reasons in July 1863, he wrote in support of the Union cause and associated with New England intellectuals. He was elected an officer in the New England Historic Genealogical Society in 1863.

His first novel, &quot;Marie Bertrand: The Felon&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, was serialized in the &quot;New York Weekly&quot; in 1864, and his first boys&#x27; book, &quot;Frank&#x27;s Campaign&quot;, was published by A. K. Loring in Boston the same year. Alger initially wrote for adult magazines, including &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and &quot;Frank Leslie&#x27;s Illustrated Newspaper&quot;, but a friendship with William Taylor Adams, a boys&#x27; author, led him to write for the young.

=== Ministry: 1864–1866 ===
On December 8, 1864, Alger was enlisted as a pastor with the First Unitarian Church and Society of Brewster, Massachusetts. Between ministerial duties, he organized games and amusements for boys in the parish, railed against smoking and drinking, and organized and served as president of the local chapter of the Cadets for Temperance. He submitted stories to &quot;The Student and Schoolmate&quot;, a boys&#x27; monthly magazine of moral writings, edited by William Taylor Adams and published in Boston by Joseph H. Allen. In September 1865, his second boys&#x27; book, &quot;Paul Prescott&#x27;s Charge&quot;, was published and received favorable reviews.

====Child sexual abuse====
Early in 1866, a church committee of men was formed to investigate reports that Alger had sexually molested boys. Church officials reported to the hierarchy in Boston that Alger had been charged with &quot;the abominable and revolting crime of gross familiarity with boys&quot;. Alger denied nothing, admitted he had been imprudent, considered his association with the church dissolved, and left town. Alger sent Unitarian officials in Boston a letter of remorse, and his father assured them his son would never seek another post in the church. The officials were satisfied and decided no further action would be taken.

=== New York City: 1866–1896 ===

In 1866, Alger relocated to New York City where he studied the condition of the street boys, and found in them an abundance of interesting material for stories. He abandoned forever any thought of a career in the church, and focused instead on his writing. He wrote &quot;Friar Anselmo&quot; at this time, a poem that tells of a sinning cleric&#x27;s atonement through good deeds. He became interested in the welfare of the thousands of vagrant children who flooded New York City following the Civil War. He attended a children&#x27;s church service at Five Points, which led to &quot;John Maynard&quot;, a ballad about an actual shipwreck on Lake Erie, which brought Alger not only the respect of the literati but a letter from Longfellow. He published two poorly received adult novels, &quot;Helen Ford&quot; and &quot;Timothy Crump&#x27;s Ward&quot;. He fared better with stories for boys published in &quot;Student and Schoolmate&quot; and a third boys&#x27; book, &quot;Charlie Codman&#x27;s Cruise&quot;.

In January 1867, the first of 12 installments of &quot;Ragged Dick&quot; appeared in &quot;Student and Schoolmate&quot;. The story, about a poor bootblack&#x27;s rise to middle-class respectability, was a huge success. It was expanded and published as a novel in 1868. It proved to be his best-selling work. After &quot;Ragged Dick&quot; he wrote almost entirely for boys, and he signed a contract with publisher Loring for a Ragged Dick Series.

In spite of the series&#x27; success, Alger was on financially uncertain ground and tutored the five sons of the international banker Joseph Seligman. He wrote serials for &quot;Young Israel&quot; and lived in the Seligman home until 1876. In 1875, Alger produced the serial &quot;Shifting for Himself&quot; and &quot;Sam&#x27;s Chance&quot;, a sequel to &quot;The Young Outlaw&quot;. It was evident in these books that Alger had grown stale. Profits suffered, and he headed West for new material at Loring&#x27;s behest, arriving in California in February 1877. He enjoyed a reunion with his brother James in San Francisco and returned to New York late in 1877 on a schooner that sailed around Cape Horn. He wrote a few lackluster books in the following years, rehashing his established themes, but this time the tales were played before a Western background rather than an urban one.

In New York, Alger continued to tutor the town&#x27;s aristocratic youth and to rehabilitate boys from the streets. He was writing both urban and Western-themed tales. In 1879, for example, he published &quot;The District Messenger Boy&quot; and &quot;The Young Miner&quot;. In 1877, Alger&#x27;s fiction became a target of librarians concerned about sensational juvenile fiction. An effort was made to remove his works from public collections, but the debate was only partially successful, defeated by the renewed interest in his work after his death.

In 1881, Alger informally adopted Charlie Davis, a street boy, and another, John Downie, in 1883; they lived in Alger&#x27;s apartment. In 1881, he wrote a biography of President James A. Garfield but filled the work with contrived conversations and boyish excitements rather than facts. The book sold well. Alger was commissioned to write a biography of Abraham Lincoln, but again it was Alger the boys&#x27; novelist opting for thrills rather than facts.

In 1882, Alger&#x27;s father died. Alger continued to produce stories of honest boys outwitting evil, greedy squires and malicious youths. His work appeared in hardcover and paperback, and decades-old poems were published in anthologies. He led a busy life with street boys, Harvard classmates, and the social elite. In Massachusetts, he was regarded with the same reverence as Harriet Beecher Stowe.

=== Last years: 1896–1899 ===
In the last two decades of the 19th century, the quality of Alger&#x27;s books deteriorated, and his boys&#x27; works became nothing more than reruns of the plots and themes of his past. The times had changed, boys expected more, and a streak of violence entered Alger&#x27;s work. In &quot;The Young Bank Messenger&quot;, for example, a woman is throttled and threatened with death—something that never occurred in his earlier work.

He attended the theater and Harvard reunions, read literary magazines, and wrote a poem at Longfellow&#x27;s death in 1882. His last novel for adults, &quot;The Disagreeable Woman&quot;, was published under the pseudonym Julian Starr. He took pleasure in the successes of the boys he had informally adopted over the years, retained his interest in reform, accepted speaking engagements, and read portions of &quot;Ragged Dick&quot; to boys&#x27; assemblies.

His popularity—and income—dwindled in the 1890s. In 1896, he had what he called a &quot;nervous breakdown&quot;; he relocated permanently to his sister&#x27;s home in South Natick, Massachusetts.

He suffered from bronchitis and asthma for two years. He died on July 18, 1899, at the home of his sister. His death was barely noticed. He is buried in the family lot at Glenwood Cemetery, South Natick, Massachusetts.

Before his death, Alger asked Edward Stratemeyer to complete his unfinished works. In 1901, &quot;Young Captain Jack&quot; was completed by Stratemeyer and promoted as Alger&#x27;s last work. Alger once estimated that he earned only $100,000 between 1866 and 1896; at his death he had little money, leaving only small sums to family and friends. His literary work was bequeathed to his niece, to two boys he had casually adopted, and to his sister Olive Augusta, who destroyed his manuscripts and his letters, according to his wishes.

Alger&#x27;s works received favorable comments and experienced a resurgence following his death. By 1926, he sold around 20 million copies in the United States. In 1926, however, reader interest plummeted, and his major publisher ceased printing the books altogether. Surveys in 1932 and 1947 revealed very few children had read or even heard of Alger. The first Alger biography was a heavily fictionalized account published in 1928 by Herbert R. Mayes, who later admitted the work was a fraud.

== Legacy ==
Since 1947, the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans has bestowed an annual award on &quot;outstanding individuals in our society who have succeeded in the face of adversity&quot; and scholarships &quot;to encourage young people to pursue their dreams with determination and perseverance&quot;.

In Maya Angelou&#x27;s 1969 autobiography, &quot;I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings&quot;, she describes her childhood belief that he was &quot;the greatest writer in the world&quot; and envy that all his protagonists were boys.

In 1982, to mark his 150th birthday, the Children&#x27;s Aid Society held a celebration. Helen M. Gray, the executive director of the Horatio Alger Association of Distinguished Americans, presented a selection of Alger&#x27;s books to Philip Coltoff, the Children&#x27;s Aid Society executive director.

A 1982 musical, &quot;Shine!&quot;, was based on Alger&#x27;s work, particularly &quot;Ragged Dick&quot; and &quot;Silas Snobden&#x27;s Office Boy&quot;.

In 2015, many of Alger&#x27;s books were published as illustrated paperbacks and ebooks under the title &quot;Stories of Success&quot; by Horatio Alger. In addition, Alger&#x27;s books were offered as dramatic audiobooks by the same publisher.

== Style and themes ==
Alger scholar Gary Scharnhorst describes Alger&#x27;s style as &quot;anachronistic&quot;, &quot;often laughable&quot;, &quot;distinctive&quot;, and &quot;distinguished by the quality of its literary allusions&quot;. Ranging from the Bible and William Shakespeare (half of Alger&#x27;s books contain Shakespearean references) to John Milton and Cicero, the allusions he employed were a testament to his erudition. Scharnhorst credits these allusions with distinguishing Alger&#x27;s novels from pulp fiction.

Scharnhorst describes six major themes in Alger&#x27;s boys&#x27; books. The first, the Rise to Respectability, he observes, is evident in both his early and his late books, notably &quot;Ragged Dick&quot;, whose impoverished young hero declares, &quot;I mean to turn over a new leaf, and try to grow up &#x27;spectable.&quot; His virtuous life wins him not riches but, more realistically, a comfortable clerical position and salary. The second major theme is Character Strengthened Through Adversity. In &quot;Strong and Steady&quot; and &quot;Shifting for Himself&quot;, for example, the affluent heroes are reduced to poverty and forced to meet the demands of their new circumstances. Alger occasionally cited the young Abe Lincoln as a representative of this theme for his readers. The third theme is Beauty versus Money, which became central to Alger&#x27;s adult fiction. Characters fall in love and marry on the basis of their character, talents, or intellect rather than the size of their bank accounts. In &quot;The Train Boy&quot;, for example, a wealthy heiress chooses to marry a talented but struggling artist, and in &quot;The Erie Train Boy&quot; a poor woman wins her true love despite the machinations of a rich, depraved suitor. Other major themes include the Old World versus the New.

All of Alger&#x27;s novels have similar plots: a boy struggles to escape poverty through hard work and clean living. However, it is not always the hard work and clean living that rescue the boy from his situation, but rather a wealthy older gentleman, who admires the boy as a result of some extraordinary act of bravery or honesty that the boy has performed. For example, the boy rescues a child from an overturned carriage or finds and returns the man&#x27;s stolen watch. Often the older man takes the boy into his home as a ward or companion and helps him find a better job, sometimes replacing a less honest or less industrious boy.

According to Scharnhorst, Alger&#x27;s father was &quot;an impoverished man&quot; who defaulted on his debts in 1844. His properties around Chelsea were seized and assigned to a local squire who held the mortgages. Scharnhorst speculates this episode in Alger&#x27;s childhood accounts for the recurrent theme in his boys&#x27; books of heroes threatened with eviction or foreclosure and may account for Alger&#x27;s &quot;consistent espousal of environmental reform proposals&quot;. Scharnhorst writes, &quot;Financially insecure throughout his life, the younger Alger may have been active in reform organizations such as those for temperance and children&#x27;s aid as a means of resolving his status-anxiety and establish his genteel credentials for leadership.&quot;

Alger scholar Edwin P. Hoyt notes that Alger&#x27;s morality &quot;coarsened&quot; around 1880, possibly influenced by the Western tales he was writing, because &quot;the most dreadful things were now almost casually proposed and explored&quot;. Although he continued to write for boys, Alger explored subjects like violence and &quot;openness in the relations between the sexes and generations&quot;; Hoyt attributes this shift to the decline of Puritan ethics in America.

Scholar John Geck notes that Alger relied on &quot;formulas for experience rather than shrewd analysis of human behavior&quot;, and that these formulas were &quot;culturally centered&quot; and &quot;strongly didactic&quot;. Although the frontier society was a thing of the past during Alger&#x27;s career, Geck contends that &quot;the idea of the frontier, even in urban slums, provides a kind of fairy tale orientation in which a Jack mentality can be both celebrated and critiqued&quot;. He claims that Alger&#x27;s intended audience were youths whose &quot;motivations for action are effectively shaped by the lessons they learn&quot;.

Geck notes that perception of the &quot;pluck&quot; characteristic of an Alger hero has changed over the decades. During the Jazz Age and the Great Depression, &quot;the Horatio Alger plot was viewed from the perspective of Progressivism as a staunch defense of laissez-faire capitalism, yet at the same time criticizing the cutthroat business techniques and offering hope to a suffering young generation during the Great Depression&quot;. By the Atomic Age, however &quot;Alger&#x27;s hero was no longer a poor boy who, through determination and providence rose to middle-class respectability. He was instead the crafty street urchin who through quick wits and luck rose from impoverishment to riches&quot;.

Geck observes that Alger&#x27;s themes have been transformed in modern America from their original meanings into a &quot;male Cinderella&quot; myth and are an Americanization of the traditional Jack tales. Each story has its clever hero, its &quot;fairy godmother&quot;, and obstacles and hindrances to the hero&#x27;s rise. &quot;However&quot;, he writes, &quot;the true Americanization of this fairy tale occurs in its subversion of this claiming of nobility; rather, the Alger hero achieves the American Dream in its nascent form, he gains a position of middle-class respectability that promises to lead wherever his motivation may take him&quot;. The reader may speculate what Cinderella achieved as Queen and what an Alger hero attained once his middle-class status was stabilized, and &quot;[i]t is this commonality that fixes Horatio Alger firmly in the ranks of modern adaptors of the Cinderella myth&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Scharnhorst writes that Alger &quot;exercised a certain discretion in discussing his probable homosexuality&quot; and was known to have mentioned his sexuality only once after the Brewster incident. In 1870, Henry James Sr. wrote that Alger &quot;talks freely about his own late insanity—which he in fact appears to enjoy as a subject of conversation&quot;. Although Alger was willing to speak to James, his sexuality was a closely guarded secret. According to Scharnhorst, Alger made veiled references to homosexuality in his boys&#x27; books, and these references, Scharnhorst speculates, indicate Alger was &quot;insecure with his sexual orientation&quot;. Alger wrote, for example, that it was difficult to distinguish whether Tattered Tom was a boy or a girl and in other instances, he introduces foppish, effeminate, lisping &quot;stereotypical homosexuals&quot; who are treated with scorn and pity by others. In &quot;Silas Snobden&#x27;s Office Boy&quot;, a kidnapped boy disguised as a girl is threatened with being sent to the &quot;insane asylum&quot; if he should reveal his actual sex. Scharnhorst believes Alger&#x27;s desire to atone for his &quot;secret sin&quot; may have &quot;spurred him to identify his own charitable acts of writing didactic books for boys with the acts of the charitable patrons in his books who wish to atone for a secret sin in their past by aiding the hero&quot;. Scharnhorst points out that the patron in &quot;Try and Trust&quot;, for example, conceals a &quot;sad secret&quot; from which he is redeemed only after saving the hero&#x27;s life.

Alan Trachtenberg, in his introduction to the Signet Classic edition of &quot;Ragged Dick&quot; (1990), points out that Alger had tremendous sympathy for boys and discovered a calling for himself in the composition of boys&#x27; books. &quot;He learned to consult the boy in himself&quot;, Trachtenberg writes, &quot;to transmute and recast himself—his genteel culture, his liberal patrician sympathy for underdogs, his shaky economic status as an author, and not least, his dangerous erotic attraction to boys—into his juvenile fiction&quot;. He observes that it is impossible to know whether Alger lived the life of a secret homosexual, &quot;[b]ut there are hints that the male companionship he describes as a refuge from the streets—the cozy domestic arrangements between Dick and Fosdick, for example—may also be an erotic relationship&quot;. Trachtenberg observes that nothing prurient occurs in &quot;Ragged Dick&quot; but believes the few instances in Alger&#x27;s work of two boys touching or a man and a boy touching &quot;might arouse erotic wishes in readers prepared to entertain such fantasies&quot;. Such images, Trachtenberg believes, may imply &quot;a positive view of homoeroticism as an alternative way of life, of living by sympathy rather than aggression&quot;. Trachtenberg concludes, &quot;in &quot;Ragged Dick&quot; we see Alger plotting domestic romance, complete with a surrogate marriage of two homeless boys, as the setting for his formulaic metamorphosis of an outcast street boy into a self-respecting citizen&quot;.

<text>Frederick Clinton Quimby (July 31, 1886 – September 16, 1965) was an American animation producer and journalist best known for producing the &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; cartoon series, for which he won seven Academy Awards for Best Animated Short Films. He was the film sales executive in charge of the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer cartoon studio, which included Tex Avery, Droopy, Butch Dog, Barney Bear, Michael Lah and multiple one-shot cartoons, as well as William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, the creators of &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;.

==Life and career==
Quimby was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and started his career as a journalist. In 1907, he managed a film theater in Missoula, Montana. Later, he worked at Pathé, and became a member of the board of directors before leaving in 1921 to become an independent producer. He was hired by Fox Film in 1924, and moved to MGM in 1927 to head its short features department. In 1937, he was assigned to create MGM&#x27;s animation department.

In 1939, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera presented Quimby with a proposal for a series of cartoons featuring a cat and a mouse. Although he had no interest in the idea, Quimby approved, and the result was &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot;, which was nominated for an Academy Award. Initially, he refused to pursue more Cat and Mouse cartoons after &quot;Puss Gets the Boot&quot;. However, following the critical and financial success of that cartoon, he agreed to make &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; an official cartoon of the MGM cartoon studio. As producer, Quimby became a multiple recipient of the Academy Award for Animated Short Film for the &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; films, though he never invited Hanna and Barbera onstage when he accepted the awards. His name became well known due to its prominence in the cartoon credits, and Quimby took sole credit for approving and producing the &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; series. Quimby was not involved in the creative process and had a difficult relationship with animators, including Hanna and Barbera, who believed that Quimby was not fit for a real animation leader:

After the production of &quot;Good Will to Men&quot; (a remake of &quot;Peace on Earth&quot;), Quimby retired from MGM in May 1955, with Hanna and Barbera assuming his role as co-heads of the studio and taking over the production title for the &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; shorts. Despite the success with Hanna and Barbera, MGM assumed that re-releasing old cartoons would be more profitable, and the MGM&#x27;s cartoon division did not last long after; it was closed in 1957. MGM would later contract first Gene Deitch and then Chuck Jones to produce more &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; shorts through their own studios during the 1960s.

Quimby died of a heart attack in Santa Monica, California on September 16, 1965, about seven weeks after his 79th birthday, and was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

<text>A startup or start-up is a company or project undertaken by an entrepreneur to seek, develop, and validate a scalable business model. While entrepreneurship includes all new businesses including self-employment and businesses that do not intend to go public, startups are new businesses that intend to grow large beyond the solo-founder. During the beginning, startups face high uncertainty and have high rates of failure, but a minority of them do go on to become successful and influential, such as unicorns.

==Actions==
Startups typically begin by a founder (solo-founder) or co-founders who have a way to solve a problem. The founder of a startup will do the market validation by problem interview, solution interview, and building a minimum viable product (MVP), i.e. a prototype, to develop and validate their business models. The startup process can take a long period of time; hence, sustaining effort is required. Over the long term, sustaining effort is especially challenging because of the high failure rates and uncertain outcomes. Having a business plan in place outlines what to do and how to plan and achieve an idea in the future. Typically, these plans outline the first three to five years of your business strategy.

===Design principles===
Models behind startups presenting as ventures are usually associated with design science. Design science uses design principles considered to be a coherent set of normative ideas and propositions to design and construct the company&#x27;s backbone. For example, one of the initial design principles is affordable loss.

===Heuristics and biases in startup actions ===
Because of the lack of information, high uncertainty, and the need to make decisions quickly, founders usually use many heuristics and exhibit biases in their leadership decisions.

Entrepreneurs often become overconfident about their startups and their influence on an outcome (case of &quot;the illusion of control&quot;). Below are some of the most critical decision biases of entrepreneurs to start up a new business.

# Overconfidence: Perceive a subjective certainty higher than the objective accuracy.
# Illusion of control: Overemphasize how much skills, instead of chance, improve performance.
# The law of small numbers: Reach conclusions about a larger population using a limited sample.
# Availability bias: Make judgments about the probability of events based on how easy it is to think of examples.
# Escalation of commitment: Persist unduly with unsuccessful initiatives or courses of action.

Startups use several action principles to generate evidence as quickly as possible to reduce the downside effect of decision biases such as an escalation of commitment, overconfidence, and the illusion of control.

===Mentoring===
Many entrepreneurs seek feedback from mentors in creating their startups. Mentors guide founders and impart entrepreneurial skills and may increase the self-efficacy of nascent entrepreneurs. Mentoring offers direction for entrepreneurs to enhance their knowledge of how to sustain their assets relating to their status and identity and strengthen their real-time skills.

==Principles==
There are many principles in creating a startup. Some of the principles needed are listed below:

===Lean startup===
Lean startup is a clear set of principles to create and design startups under limited resources and tremendous uncertainty to build their ventures more flexibly and at a lower cost. It is based on the idea that entrepreneurs can make their implicit assumptions about how their venture works explicit and empirically testing it. The empirical test is to de/validate these assumptions and to get an engaged understanding of the business model of the new ventures, and in doing so, the new ventures are created iteratively in a build–measure–learn loop. Hence, lean startup is a set of principles for entrepreneurial learning and business model design. More precisely, it is a set of design principles aimed for iteratively experiential learning under uncertainty in an engaged empirical manner. Typically, a lean startup focuses on a few lean principles:

* find a problem worth solving, then define a solution
* engage early adopters for market validation
* continually test with smaller, faster iterations
* build a function, measure customer response, and verify/refute the idea
* evidence-based decisions on when to pivot by changing your plan&#x27;s course
* maximize the efforts for speed, learning, and focus

===Market validation===
A key principle of startup is to validate the market need before providing a customer-centric product or service to avoid business ideas with weak demand. Market validation can be done in a number of ways, including surveys, cold calling, email responses, word of mouth or through sample research.

===Design thinking===
Design thinking is used to understand the customers&#x27; need in an engaged manner. Design thinking and customer development can be biased because they do not remove the risk of bias because the same biases manifest in the sources of information, the type of information sought, and the interpretation of that information. Encouraging people to consider the opposite of whatever decision they are about to make tends to reduce biases such as overconfidence, the hindsight bias, and anchoring.

===Decision-making under uncertainty===
In startups, many decisions are made under uncertainty, and hence a key principle for startups is to be agile and flexible. Founders can embed options to design startups in flexible manners, so that the startups can change easily in future.

Uncertainty can vary within-person (I feel more uncertain this year than last year) and between-person (he feels more uncertain than she does). A study found that when entrepreneurs feel more uncertain, they identify more opportunities (within-person difference), but entrepreneurs who perceive more uncertainties than others do not identify more opportunities than others do (no between-person difference).

===Partnering===
Startups may form partnerships with other firms to enable their business model to operate. To become attractive to other businesses, startups need to align their internal features, such as management style and products with the market situation. In their 2013 study, Kask and Linton develop two ideal profiles, or also known as configurations or archetypes, for startups that are commercializing inventions. The &quot;inheritor&quot; profile calls for a management style that is not too entrepreneurial (more conservative) and the startup should have an incremental invention (building on a previous standard). This profile is set out to be more successful (in finding a business partner) in a market with a dominant design (a clear standard is applied in this market). In contrast to this, profile is the &quot;originator&quot; which has a management style that is highly entrepreneurial and in which a radical invention or a disruptive innovation (totally new standard) is being developed. This profile is set out to be more successful (in finding a business partner) in a market that does not have a dominant design (established standard). New startups should align themselves to one of the profiles when commercializing an invention to be able to find and be attractive to a business partner. By finding a business partner, a startup has greater chances of success.

Startups usually need many different partners to realize their business idea. The commercialization process is often a bumpy road with iterations and new insights during the process. Hasche and Linton argue that startups can learn from their relationships with other firms, and even if the relationship ends, the startup will have gained valuable knowledge about how it should move on going forward. When a relationship is failing for a startup it needs to make changes. Three types of changes can be identified according to Hasche and Linton:

* Change of business concept for the start up
* Change of collaboration constellation (change several relationships)
* Change of characteristic of business relationship (with the partner, e.g. from a transactional relationship to more of a collaborative type of relationship)

===Entrepreneurial learning===

Startups need to learn at a huge speed before running out of resources. Proactive actions (experimentation, searching, etc.) enhance a founder&#x27;s learning to start a company. To learn effectively, founders often formulate falsifiable hypotheses, build a minimum viable product (MVP), and conduct A/B testing.

===Business Model Design===
With the key learnings from market validation, design thinking, and lean startup, founders can design a business model. However it is important not to dive into business models too early before there is sufficient learning on market validation. Paul Graham said: &quot;What I tell founders is not to sweat the business model too much at first. The most important task at first is to build something people want. If you don&#x27;t do that, it won&#x27;t matter how clever your business model is.&quot;

==Founders/entrepreneurs==

Founders or co-founders are people involved in the initial launch of startup companies. Three people are mainly required as co-founders to create a powerful team: the product person (e.g. an engineer), a marketing person (for market research, customer interaction, vision) and a finance or operation&#x27;s person (to handle operations or raise funds).

The founder that is responsible for the overall strategy of the startup plays the role of founder-CEOs, much like CEOs in established firms. Startup studios provide an opportunity for founders and team members to grow along with the business they help to build. In order to create forward momentum, founders must ensure that they provide opportunities for their team members to grow and evolve within the company.

The language of securities regulation in the United States considers co-founders to be promoters under Regulation D. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission definition of promoter includes: (i) Any person who, acting alone or in conjunction with one or more other persons, directly or indirectly takes initiative in founding and organizing the business or enterprise of an issuer; However, not every promoter is a co-founder. In fact, there is no formal, legal definition of what makes somebody a co-founder. The right to call oneself a co-founder can be established through an agreement with one&#x27;s fellow co-founders or with permission of the board of directors, investors, or shareholders of a startup company. When there is no definitive agreement (like shareholders&#x27; agreement), disputes about who the co-founders are, can arise.

===Self-efficacy===
Self-efficacy refers to the confidence an individual has to create a new business or startup. It has a strong relation with startup actions. Entrepreneurs&#x27; sense of self-efficacy can play a major role in how they approach goals, tasks, and challenges. Entrepreneurs with high self-efficacy—that is, those who believe they can perform well—are more likely to view difficult tasks as something to be mastered rather than something to be avoided.

===Stress===
Entrepreneurs often feel stressed. They have internal and external pressures. Internally, they need to meet deadlines to develop the prototypes and get the product or service ready for market. Externally they are expected to meet milestones of investors and other stakeholders to ensure continued resources from them on the startups. Coping with stress is critical to entrepreneurs because of the stressful nature of starting up a new firm under uncertainty. Coping with stress unsuccessfully could lead to emotional exhaustion, and the founders may close or exit the startups.

===Emotional exhaustion===
Sustaining effort is required as the startup process can take a long period of time, by one estimate, three years or longer. Sustaining effort over the long term is especially challenging because of the high failure rates and uncertain outcomes.

===Founder identity and culture===
Some startup founders have a more casual or offbeat attitude in their dress, office space and marketing, as compared to executives in established corporations. For example, startup founders in the 2010s wore hoodies, sneakers and other casual clothes to business meetings. Their offices may have recreational facilities in them, such as pool tables, ping pong tables, football tables and pinball machines, which are used to create a fun work environment, stimulate team development and team spirit, and encourage creativity. Some of the casual approaches, such as the use of &quot;flat&quot; organizational structures, in which regular employees can talk with the founders and chief executive officers informally, are done to promote efficiency in the workplace, which is needed to get their business off the ground.

In a 1960 study, Douglas McGregor stressed that punishments and rewards for uniformity in the workplace are not necessary because some people are born with the motivation to work without incentives. Some startups do not use a strict command and control hierarchical structure, with executives, managers, supervisors and employees. Some startups offer employees incentives such as stock options, to increase their &quot;buy in&quot; from the start up (as these employees stand to gain if the company does well). This removal of stressors allows the workers and researchers in the startup to focus less on the work environment around them, and more on achieving the task at hand, giving them the potential to achieve something great for both themselves and their company.

==Failure==
The failure rate of startup companies is very high. A 2014 article in &quot;Fortune&quot; estimated that 90% of startups ultimately fail. In a sample of 101 unsuccessful startups, companies reported that experiencing one or more of five common factors were the reason for failure; the lack of consumer interest in the product or service (42% of failures), funding or cash problems (29%), personnel or staffing problems (23%), competition from rival companies (19%) and problems with pricing of the product or service (18%). In cases of funding problems, it can leave employees without paychecks. Sometimes, these companies are purchased by other companies if they are deemed to be viable, but oftentimes, they leave employees with very little recourse to recoup lost income for worked time. More than one-third of founders believe that running out of money led to failure. Second to that, founders attribute their failure to a lack of financing or investor interest. These common mistakes and missteps that happen early in the startup journey can result in failure, but there are precautions entrepreneurs can take to help mitigate risk. For example, startup studios offer a buffer against many of the obstacles that solo entrepreneurs face, such as funding and insufficient team structure, making them a good resource for startups in their earliest phases. Another large study of 160.000 failed companies, identified key factors such as a dysfunctional founding team, a poor business plan, or just a flawed product-market fit as examples of the primary sources of failure.

The lack of human and financial resources or even dedicated patent attorneys in the early stages of a startup makes it difficult to compete with larger companies, and likewise increases the time and reduces the probability of patent applications.

===Re-starters===
Failed entrepreneurs, or restarters, who after some time restart in the same sector with more or less the same activities, have an increased chance of becoming a better entrepreneur. However, some studies indicate that restarters are more heavily discouraged in Europe than in the US.

==Training==

Many institutions and universities provide training on startups. In the context of universities, some of the courses are entrepreneurship courses that also deal with the topic of startups, while other courses are specifically dedicated to startups. Startup courses are found both in traditional economic or business disciplines as well as the side of information technology disciplines. As startups are often focused on software, they are also occasionally taught while focusing on software development alongside the business aspects of a startup.

Founders go through a lot to set up a startup. A startup requires patience and resilience, and training programs need to have both the business components and the psychological components. Entrepreneurship education is effective in increasing the entrepreneurial attitudes and perceived behavioral control, helping people and their businesses grow. Most of startup training falls into the mode of experiential learning, in which students are exposed to a large extent to a real-life entrepreneurship context as new venture teams. An example of group-based experiential startup training is the Lean LaunchPad initiative that applies the principles of customer development and Lean Startup to technology-based startup projects.

As startups are typically thought to operate under a notable lack of resources, have little or no operating history, and to consist of individuals with little practical experience, it is possible to simulate startups in a classroom setting with reasonable accuracy. In fact, it is not uncommon for students to actually participate in real startups during and after their studies. Similarly, university courses teaching software startup themes often have students found mock-up startups during the courses and encourage them to make them into real startups should they wish to do so. Such mock-up startups, however, may not be enough to accurately simulate real-world startup practice if the challenges typically faced by startups (e.g. lack of funding to keep operating) are not present in the course setting.

To date, much of the entrepreneurship training is yet to be personalized to match the participants and the training.

==Ecosystem==
The size and maturity of the startup ecosystem is where a startup is launched and where it grows to have an effect on the volume and success of the startups. The startup ecosystem consists of the individuals (entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, angel investors, mentors, advisors); institutions and organizations (top research universities and institutes, business schools and entrepreneurship programs and centres operated by universities and colleges, non-profit entrepreneurship support organizations, government entrepreneurship programs and services, Chambers of commerce) business incubators and business accelerators and top-performing entrepreneurial firms and startups. A region with all of these elements is considered to be a &quot;strong&quot; startup ecosystem.

One of the most famous startup ecosystems is Silicon Valley in California, where major computer and internet firms and top universities such as Stanford University create a stimulating startup environment. Boston (where Massachusetts Institute of Technology is located) and Berlin, home of WISTA (a top research area), also have numerous creative industries, leading entrepreneurs and startup firms. Basically, attempts are being made worldwide, for example in Israel with its Silicon Wadi, in France with the Inovallée or in Italy in Trieste with the AREA Science Park, to network basic research, universities and technology parks in order to create a startup-friendly ecosystem.

Although there are startups created in all types of businesses, and all over the world, some locations and business sectors are particularly associated with startup companies. The internet bubble of the late 1990s was associated with huge numbers of internet startup companies, some selling the technology to provide internet access, others using the internet to provide services. Most of this startup activity was located in the most well-known startup ecosystem - Silicon Valley, an area of northern California renowned for the high level of startup company activity:

Startup advocates are also trying to build a community of tech startups in New York City with organizations like NY Tech Meet Up and Built in NYC. In the early 2000s, the patent assets of failed startup companies were being purchased by people known as patent trolls, who assert those patents against companies that might be infringing the technology covered by the patents.

==Investing==

Startup investing is the action of making an investment in an early-stage company. Beyond founders&#x27; own contributions, some startups raise additional investment at some or several stages of their growth. Not all startups trying to raise investments are successful in their fundraising.Venture Capital is a subdivision of Private Equity wherein external investors fund small-scale startups that have high growth potential in the long run. Venture capital is the money of invention that is invested into young businesses which hold no historic background. Usually, the business of venture capital is highly risky but one can at the same time expect high returns as well.

In the United States, the solicitation of funds became easier for startups as result of the JOBS Act. Prior to the advent of equity crowdfunding, a form of online investing that has been legalized in several nations, startups did not advertise themselves to the general public as investment opportunities until and unless they first obtained approval from regulators for an initial public offering (IPO) that typically involved a listing of the startup&#x27;s securities on a stock exchange. Today, there are many alternative forms of IPO commonly employed by startups and startup promoters that do not include an exchange listing, so they may avoid certain regulatory compliance obligations, including mandatory periodic disclosures of financial information and factual discussion of business conditions by management that investors and potential investors routinely receive from registered public companies.

Over the last decade, Europe has developed a rapid start-up scene that has given birth to global players, including more than 70 unicorns, and has created more than two million jobs. Investment in European start-ups increased sixfold between 2010 and 2020, reaching approximately €40 billion. Europe does a poorer job of nurturing young companies because of a failure to support their development into industry leaders. Promising European start-ups then struggle to raise the necessary capital to expand and mature. They are forced to either relocate to the US&#x27;s deep capital markets or sell themselves to larger rivals with more financial availability. As a result, start-ups in the United States can typically raise far more money—up to five times as much as in Europe.

Investors are generally most attracted to those new companies distinguished by their strong co-founding team, a balanced &quot;risk/reward&quot; profile (in which high risk due to the untested, disruptive innovations is balanced out by high potential returns) and &quot;scalability&quot; (the likelihood that a startup can expand its operations by serving more markets or more customers). Attractive startups generally have lower &quot;bootstrapping&quot; (self-funding of startups by the founders) costs, higher risk, and higher potential return on investment. Successful startups are typically more scalable than an established business, in the sense that the startup has the potential to grow rapidly with a limited investment of capital, labor or land. Timing has often been the single most important factor for biggest startup successes, while at the same time it is identified to be one of the hardest things to master by many serial entrepreneurs and investors.

Startups have several options for funding. Revenue-based financing lenders can help startup companies by providing non-dilutive growth capital in exchange for a percentage of monthly revenue. Venture capital firms and angel investors may help startup companies begin operations, exchanging seed money for an equity stake in the firm. Venture capitalists and angel investors provide financing to a range of startups (a portfolio), with the expectation that a very small number of the startups will become viable and make money. In practice though, many startups are initially funded by the founders themselves using &quot;bootstrapping&quot;, in which loans or monetary gifts from friends and family are combined with savings and credit card debt to finance the venture. Factoring is another option, though it is not unique to startups. Other funding opportunities include various forms of crowdfunding, for example equity crowdfunding, in which the startup seeks funding from a large number of individuals, typically by pitching their idea on the Internet.

Startups can receive funding via more involved stakeholders, such as startup studios. Startup studios provide funding to support the business through a successful launch, but they also provide extensive operational support, such as HR, finance and accounting, marketing, and product development, to increase the probability of success and propel growth.

Startup are funded through preset rounds, depending on their funding requirement and the stage of growth of the company. Startup investing is generally divided into six stage, namely

# Angel funding
# Seed Funding
# Pre-Series A
# Series B
# Series C,D
# Series E, F and Beyond 

===Necessity of funding===
While some (would-be) entrepreneurs believe that they can&#x27;t start a company without funding from VC, Angel, etc. that is not the case. In fact, many entrepreneurs have founded successful businesses for almost no capital, including the founders of MailChimp, Shopify, and ShutterStock.

===Valuations===
If a company&#x27;s value is based on its technology, it is often equally important for the business owners to obtain intellectual property protection for their idea. The newsmagazine &quot;The Economist&quot; estimated that up to 75% of the value of US public companies is now based on their intellectual property (up from 40% in 1980). Often, 100% of a small startup company&#x27;s value is based on its intellectual property. As such, it is important for technology-oriented startup companies to develop a sound strategy for protecting their intellectual capital as early as possible. Startup companies, particularly those associated with new technology, sometimes produce huge returns to their creators and investors—a recent example of such is Google, whose creators became billionaires through their stock ownership and options.

===Investing rounds===
When investing in a startup, there are different types of stages in which the investor can participate. The first round is called seed round. The seed round generally is when the startup is still in the very early phase of execution when their product is still in the prototype phase. There is likely no performance data or positive financials as of yet. Therefore, investors rely on strength of the idea and the team in place. At this level, family friends and angel investors will be the ones participating. At this stage the level of risk and payoff are at their greatest. The next round is called Series A. At this point the company already has traction and may be making revenue. In Series A rounds venture capital firms will be participating alongside angels or super angel investors. The next rounds are Series B, C, and D. These three rounds are the ones leading towards the Initial Public Offering (IPO). Venture capital firms and private equity firms will be participating. Series B: Companies are generating consistent revenue but must scale to meet growing demand. Series C &amp; D: Companies with strong financial performance looking to expand to new markets, develop new products, make an acquisition, and/or preparing for IPO.

===History of startup investing===
After the Great Depression, which was blamed in part on a rise in speculative investments in unregulated small companies, startup investing was primarily a word of mouth activity reserved for the friends and family of a startup&#x27;s co-founders, business angels, and Venture Capital funds. In the United States, this has been the case ever since the implementation of the Securities Act of 1933. Many nations implemented similar legislation to prohibit general solicitation and general advertising of unregistered securities, including shares offered by startup companies. In 2005, a new Accelerator investment model was introduced by Y Combinator that combined fixed terms investment model with fixed period intense bootcamp style training program, to streamline the seed/early-stage investment process with training to be more systematic.

Following Y Combinator, many accelerators with similar models have emerged around the world. The accelerator model has since become very common and widely spread and they are key organizations of any Startup ecosystem. Title II of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act), first implemented on 23 September 2013, granted startups in and startup co-founders or promoters in US. the right to generally solicit and advertise publicly using any method of communication on the condition that only accredited investors are allowed to purchase the securities. However the regulations affecting equity crowdfunding in different countries vary a lot with different levels and models of freedom and restrictions. In many countries there are no limitations restricting general public from investing to startups, while there can still be other types of restrictions in place, like limiting the amount that companies can seek from investors. Due to positive development and growth of crowdfunding, many countries are actively updating their regulation in regards to crowdfunding.

===Investing online===
The first known investment-based crowdfunding platform for startups was launched in February 2010 by Grow VC, followed by the first US. based company ProFounder launching model for startups to raise investments directly on the site, but ProFounder later decided to shut down its business due regulatory reasons preventing them from continuing, having launched their model for US. markets prior to JOBS Act. With the positive progress of the JOBS Act for crowd investing in US., equity crowdfunding platforms like SeedInvest and CircleUp started to emerge in 2011 and platforms such as investiere, Companisto and Seedrs in Europe and OurCrowd in Israel. The idea of these platforms is to streamline the process and resolve the two main points that were taking place in the market. The first problem was for startups to be able to access capital and to decrease the amount of time that it takes to close a round of financing. The second problem was intended to increase the amount of deal flow for the investor and to also centralize the process.

==Internal startups==
Internal startups are a form of corporate entrepreneurship. Large or well-established companies often try to promote innovation by setting up &quot;internal startups&quot;, new business divisions that operate at arm&#x27;s length from the rest of the company. Examples include Bell Labs, a research unit within the Bell System and Target Corporation (which began as an internal startup of the Dayton&#x27;s department store chain) and threedegrees, a product developed by an internal startup of Microsoft.

==Unicorns==

Some startups become big and they become unicorns, i.e. privately held startup companies valued at over US$1 billion. The term was coined in 2013 by venture capitalist Aileen Lee, choosing the mythical animal to represent the statistical rarity of such successful ventures. According to &quot;TechCrunch&quot;, there were 452 unicorns as of May 2019, and most of the unicorns are in the US, followed by China. The unicorns are concentrated in a few countries. The unicorn leaders are the U.S. with 196 companies, China with 165, India with 107 and the U.K. with 16. The largest unicorns included Ant Financial, ByteDance, DiDi, Uber, Xiaomi, and Airbnb. When the value of a company is over US$10 billion, the company will be called as a Decacorn. When the company is valued over US$100 billion, Hectocorn will be used.

== Critiques of the start-up mode ==
According to Nikos Smyrnaios, Silicon Valley&#x27;s start-ups are emblematic of the post-Fordist enterprise, reflecting a move toward values of liberty, autonomy and authenticity, and away from the Fordist emphasis on solidarity, economic security and equality.

For some researchers, such as Antoine Gouritin, the start-up model, like many digital-related objects, is underpinned by a &quot;solutionist&quot; logic, as Evgeny Morozov describes it. &quot;Technological solutionism&quot; corresponds to the belief that thanks to digital tools such as those created by start-ups, simple and technical solutions can be found to all kinds of problems. Therefore, what is expected of start-ups is not that they address the root causes of problems, but that they find effective technical solutions quickly.

The organizational model of start-ups is also questioned by former employees. For example, Mathilde Ramadier, a former start-up employee, brings the debate to the fore in France with her book &quot;Bienvenue dans le nouveau monde. Comment j&#x27;ai survécu à la coolitude des start-ups&quot; [&quot;Welcome to the new world. How I survived start-up coolness&quot;] in 2017. Since then, awareness has been growing. The non-hierarchical organization of start-ups means that all employees bear equal responsibility for their running smoothly. They are based on voluntary commitment and internalized behavioral norms rather than formal hierarchical constraints. Employees, encouraged to meet targets, often exceed overtime limits. Professional and personal life often blend in this highly connected environment. Employees are expected, without discussion, to give of themselves without counting the cost, to be always reachable and available, without asking for compensation commensurate with their professional commitment (in terms of time and activities), and to place the general interest of the organization before their personal interest. Finally, the employment contracts of start-up employees are often precarious since the company itself is not completely stable.

Economist Scott A. Shane has used data on start-ups published in many countries to draw conclusions in terms of public policy. He is critical of public policy that encourages start-ups, pointing to evidence that these policies lead people to create marginal businesses that are more likely to fail, have little economic impact, and generate a very limited number of jobs.

== Today ==
Today, the San Francisco bay area has the highest number of startups globally, with 14,500. It is followed by New York City with 12,500 and Silicon Wadi in Israel, with around 9000, which is the highest per capita figure in the world.

According to PitchBook research, nearly 1 in 4 startups claims to be an Artificial intelligence company as of 2024.

<text>Ludus duodecim scriptorum, or XII scripta, was a board game popular during the time of the Roman Empire. The name translates as &quot;game of twelve markings&quot;, probably referring to the three rows of 12 markings each found on most surviving boards. The game tabula is thought to be a descendant of this game, and both are tables games as is modern backgammon.

It has been speculated that XII scripta is related to the Egyptian game senet. A factor casting doubt on this link is that the latest known classical senet board is over half of a millennium older than the earliest known XII scripta board.

Very little information about specific gameplay has survived. The game was played using three cubic dice, and each player had 15 pieces. A possible &quot;beginners&#x27; board&quot;, having spaces marked with letters, has suggested a possible path for the movement of pieces.

The earliest known mention of the game is in Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Ars Amatoria&quot; (&quot;The Art of Love&quot;) (written between 1 BC and 8 AD). An ancient example of the game was excavated at the archaeological site of Kibyra in southern Turkey.

<text>In economics and finance, present value (PV), also known as present discounted value(PDV), is the value of an expected income stream determined as of the date of valuation. The present value is usually less than the future value because money has interest-earning potential, a characteristic referred to as the time value of money, except during times of negative interest rates, when the present value will be equal or more than the future value. Time value can be described with the simplified phrase, &quot;A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow&quot;. Here, &#x27;worth more&#x27; means that its value is greater than tomorrow. A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow because the dollar can be invested and earn a day&#x27;s worth of interest, making the total accumulate to a value more than a dollar by tomorrow. Interest can be compared to rent. Just as rent is paid to a landlord by a tenant without the ownership of the asset being transferred, interest is paid to a lender by a borrower who gains access to the money for a time before paying it back. By letting the borrower have access to the money, the lender has sacrificed the exchange value of this money, and is compensated for it in the form of interest. The initial amount of borrowed funds (the present value) is less than the total amount of money paid to the lender.

Present value calculations, and similarly future value calculations, are used to value loans, mortgages, annuities, sinking funds, perpetuities, bonds, and more. These calculations are used to make comparisons between cash flows that don’t occur at simultaneous times, since time and dates must be consistent in order to make comparisons between values. When deciding between projects in which to invest, the choice can be made by comparing respective present values of such projects by means of discounting the expected income streams at the corresponding project interest rate, or rate of return. The project with the highest present value, i.e. that is most valuable today, should be chosen.

==Background==
If offered a choice between $100 today or $100 in one year, and there is a positive real interest rate throughout the year, a rational person will choose $100 today. This is described by economists as time preference. Time preference can be measured by auctioning off a risk free security—like a US Treasury bill. If a $100 note with a zero coupon, payable in one year, sells for $80 now, then $80 is the present value of the note that will be worth $100 a year from now. This is because money can be put in a bank account or any other (safe) investment that will return interest in the future.

An investor who has some money has two options: to spend it right now or to save it. But the financial compensation for saving it (and not spending it) is that the money value will accrue through the compound interest that he or she will receive from a borrower (the bank account in which he has the money deposited).

Therefore, to evaluate the real value of an amount of money today after a given period of time, economic agents compound the amount of money at a given (interest) rate. Most actuarial calculations use the risk-free interest rate which corresponds to the minimum guaranteed rate provided by a bank&#x27;s saving account for example, assuming no risk of default by the bank to return the money to the account holder on time. To compare the change in purchasing power, the real interest rate (nominal interest rate minus inflation rate) should be used.

The operation of evaluating a present value into the future value is called a capitalization (how much will $100 today be worth in 5 years?). The reverse operation—evaluating the present value of a future amount of money—is called a discounting (how much will $100 received in 5 years—at a lottery for example—be worth today?).

It follows that if one has to choose between receiving $100 today and $100 in one year, the rational decision is to choose the $100 today. If the money is to be received in one year and assuming the savings account interest rate is 5%, the person has to be offered at least $105 in one year so that the two options are equivalent (either receiving $100 today or receiving $105 in one year). This is because if $100 is deposited in a savings account, the value will be $105 after one year, again assuming no risk of losing the initial amount through bank default.

==Interest rates==
Interest is the additional amount of money gained between the beginning and the end of a time period. Interest represents the time value of money, and can be thought of as rent that is required of a borrower in order to use money from a lender. For example, when an individual takes out a bank loan, the individual is charged interest. Alternatively, when an individual deposits money into a bank, the money earns interest. In this case, the bank is the borrower of the funds and is responsible for crediting interest to the account holder. Similarly, when an individual invests in a company (through corporate bonds, or through stock), the company is borrowing funds, and must pay interest to the individual (in the form of coupon payments, dividends, or stock price appreciation).
The interest rate is the change, expressed as a percentage, in the amount of money during one compounding period. A compounding period is the length of time that must transpire before interest is credited, or added to the total. For example, interest that is compounded annually is credited once a year, and the compounding period is one year. Interest that is compounded quarterly is credited four times a year, and the compounding period is three months. A compounding period can be any length of time, but some common periods are annually, semiannually, quarterly, monthly, daily, and even continuously.

There are several types and terms associated with interest rates:
*Compound interest, interest that increases exponentially over subsequent periods,
*Simple interest, additive interest that does not increase
*Effective interest rate, the effective equivalent compared to multiple compound interest periods
*Nominal annual interest, the simple annual interest rate of multiple interest periods
*Discount rate, an inverse interest rate when performing calculations in reverse
*Continuously compounded interest, the mathematical limit of an interest rate with a period of zero time.
*Real interest rate, which accounts for inflation.

==Calculation==
The operation of evaluating a present sum of money some time in the future is called a capitalization (how much will 100 today be worth in five years?). The reverse operation—evaluating the present value of a future amount of money—is called discounting (how much will 100 received in five years be worth today?).

Spreadsheets commonly offer functions to compute present value. In Microsoft Excel, there are present value functions for single payments - &quot;=NPV(...)&quot;, and series of equal, periodic payments - &quot;=PV(...)&quot;. Programs will calculate present value flexibly for any cash flow and interest rate, or for a schedule of different interest rates at different times.

===Present value of a lump sum===
The most commonly applied model of present valuation uses compound interest. The standard formula is:

:formula_1

Where formula_2 is the future amount of money that must be discounted, formula_3 is the number of compounding periods between the present date and the date where the sum is worth formula_2, formula_5 is the interest rate for one compounding period (the end of a compounding period is when interest is applied, for example, annually, semiannually, quarterly, monthly, daily). The interest rate, formula_5, is given as a percentage, but expressed as a decimal in this formula.

Often, formula_7 is referred to as the Present Value Factor 

This is also found from the formula for the future value with negative time.

For example, if you are to receive $1000 in five years, and the effective annual interest rate during this period is 10% (or 0.10), then the present value of this amount is

:formula_8

The interpretation is that for an effective annual interest rate of 10%, an individual would be indifferent to receiving $1000 in five years, or $620.92 today.

The purchasing power in today&#x27;s money of an amount formula_2 of money, formula_3 years into the future, can be computed with the same formula, where in this case formula_5 is an assumed future inflation rate.

If we are using lower discount rate(&quot;i&quot; ), then it allows the present values in the discount future to have higher values.

===Net present value of a stream of cash flows===
A cash flow is an amount of money that is either paid out or received, differentiated by a negative or positive sign, at the end of a period. Conventionally, cash flows that are received are denoted with a positive sign (total cash has increased) and cash flows that are paid out are denoted with a negative sign (total cash has decreased). The cash flow for a period represents the net change in money of that period. Calculating the net present value, formula_12, of a stream of cash flows consists of discounting each cash flow to the present, using the present value factor and the appropriate number of compounding periods, and combining these values.

For example, if a stream of cash flows consists of +$100 at the end of period one, -$50 at the end of period two, and +$35 at the end of period three, and the interest rate per compounding period is 5% (0.05) then the present value of these three Cash Flows are:

:formula_13
:formula_14
:formula_15 respectively

Thus the net present value would be:

:formula_16

There are a few considerations to be made.
* The periods might not be consecutive. If this is the case, the exponents will change to reflect the appropriate number of periods
* The interest rates per period might not be the same. The cash flow must be discounted using the interest rate for the appropriate period: if the interest rate changes, the sum must be discounted to the period where the change occurs using the second interest rate, then discounted back to the present using the first interest rate. For example, if the cash flow for period one is $100, and $200 for period two, and the interest rate for the first period is 5%, and 10% for the second, then the net present value would be:

:formula_17
* The interest rate must necessarily coincide with the payment period. If not, either the payment period or the interest rate must be modified. For example, if the interest rate given is the effective annual interest rate, but cash flows are received (and/or paid) quarterly, the interest rate per quarter must be computed. This can be done by converting effective annual interest rate, formula_18, to nominal annual interest rate compounded quarterly:
:formula_19

Here, formula_20 is the nominal annual interest rate, compounded quarterly, and the interest rate per quarter is formula_21

====Present value of an annuity====

Many financial arrangements (including bonds, other loans, leases, salaries, membership dues, annuities including annuity-immediate and annuity-due, straight-line depreciation charges) stipulate structured payment schedules; payments of the same amount at regular time intervals. Such an arrangement is called an annuity. The expressions for the present value of such payments are summations of geometric series.

There are two types of annuities: an annuity-immediate and annuity-due. For an annuity immediate, formula_22 payments are received (or paid) at the end of each period, at times 1 through formula_22, while for an annuity due, formula_22 payments are received (or paid) at the beginning of each period, at times 0 through formula_25. This subtle difference must be accounted for when calculating the present value.

An annuity due is an annuity immediate with one more interest-earning period. Thus, the two present values differ by a factor of formula_26:

:formula_27

The present value of an annuity immediate is the value at time 0 of the stream of cash flows:

:formula_28

where:

:formula_22 = number of periods,

:formula_30 = amount of cash flows,

:formula_18 = effective periodic interest rate or rate of return.

====An approximation for annuity and loan calculations====
The above formula (1) for annuity immediate calculations offers little insight for the average user and requires the use of some form of computing machinery. There is an approximation which is less intimidating, easier to compute and offers some insight for the non-specialist. It is given by 
:: formula_32

Where, as above, C is annuity payment, PV is principal, n is number of payments, starting at end of first period, and i is interest rate per period. Equivalently C is the periodic loan repayment for a loan of PV extending over n periods at interest rate, i. The formula is valid (for positive n, i) for ni≤3. For completeness, for ni≥3 the approximation is formula_33.

The formula can, under some circumstances, reduce the calculation to one of mental arithmetic alone. For example, what are the (approximate) loan repayments for a loan of PV = $10,000 repaid annually for n = ten years at 15% interest (i = 0.15)? The applicable approximate formula is C ≈ 10,000*(1/10 + (2/3) 0.15) = 10,000*(0.1+0.1) = 10,000*0.2 = $2000 pa by mental arithmetic alone. The true answer is $1993, very close.

The overall approximation is accurate to within ±6% (for all n≥1) for interest rates 0≤i≤0.20 and within ±10% for interest rates 0.20≤i≤0.40. It is, however, intended only for &quot;rough&quot; calculations.

====Present value of a perpetuity====
A perpetuity refers to periodic payments, receivable indefinitely, although few such instruments exist. The present value of a perpetuity can be calculated by taking the limit of the above formula as &quot;n&quot; approaches infinity.

:formula_34

Formula (2) can also be found by subtracting from (1) the present value of a perpetuity delayed n periods, or directly by summing the present value of the payments

:formula_35

which form a geometric series.

Again there is a distinction between a perpetuity immediate – when payments received at the end of the period – and a perpetuity due – payment received at the beginning of a period. And similarly to annuity calculations, a perpetuity due and a perpetuity immediate differ by a factor of formula_36:

:formula_37

====PV of a bond====
:&quot;See: Bond valuation#Present value approach&quot;
A corporation issues a bond, an interest earning debt security, to an investor to raise funds. The bond has a face value, formula_38, coupon rate, formula_39, and maturity date which in turn yields the number of periods until the debt matures and must be repaid. A bondholder will receive coupon payments semiannually (unless otherwise specified) in the amount of formula_40, until the bond matures, at which point the bondholder will receive the final coupon payment and the face value of a bond, formula_41.

The present value of a bond is the purchase price.
The purchase price can be computed as:
:formula_42 formula_43

The purchase price is equal to the bond&#x27;s face value if the coupon rate is equal to the current interest rate of the market, and in this case, the bond is said to be sold &#x27;at par&#x27;. If the coupon rate is less than the market interest rate, the purchase price will be less than the bond&#x27;s face value, and the bond is said to have been sold &#x27;at a discount&#x27;, or below par. Finally, if the coupon rate is greater than the market interest rate, the purchase price will be greater than the bond&#x27;s face value, and the bond is said to have been sold &#x27;at a premium&#x27;, or above par.

=====Technical details=====
Present value is additive. The present value of a bundle of cash flows is the sum of each one&#x27;s present value. See time value of money for further discussion.
These calculations must be applied carefully, as there are underlying assumptions:
* That it is not necessary to account for price inflation, or alternatively, that the cost of inflation is incorporated into the interest rate; see Inflation-indexed bond.
* That the likelihood of receiving the payments is high — or, alternatively, that the default risk is incorporated into the interest rate; see Corporate bond#Risk analysis.
(In fact, the present value of a cashflow at a constant interest rate is mathematically one point in the Laplace transform of that cashflow, evaluated with the transform variable (usually denoted &quot;s&quot;) equal to the interest rate. The full Laplace transform is the curve of all present values, plotted as a function of interest rate. For discrete time, where payments are separated by large time periods, the transform reduces to a sum, but when payments are ongoing on an almost continual basis, the mathematics of continuous functions can be used as an approximation.)

===Variants/approaches===
There are mainly two flavors of Present Value. Whenever there will be uncertainties in both timing and amount of the cash flows, the expected present value approach will often be the appropriate technique. With Present Value under uncertainty, future dividends are replaced by their conditional expectation.
* Traditional Present Value Approach – in this approach a single set of estimated cash flows and a single interest rate (commensurate with the risk, typically a weighted average of cost components) will be used to estimate the fair value.
* Expected Present Value Approach – in this approach multiple cash flows scenarios with different/expected probabilities and a credit-adjusted risk free rate are used to estimate the fair value.

===Choice of interest rate===
The interest rate used is the risk-free interest rate if there are no risks involved in the project. The rate of return from the project must equal or exceed this rate of return or it would be better to invest the capital in these risk free assets. If there are risks involved in an investment this can be reflected through the use of a risk premium. The risk premium required can be found by comparing the project with the rate of return required from other projects with similar risks. Thus it is possible for investors to take account of any uncertainty involved in various investments.

==Present value method of valuation==
An investor, the lender of money, must decide the financial project in which to invest their money, and present value offers one method of deciding.
A financial project requires an initial outlay of money, such as the price of stock or the price of a corporate bond. The project claims to return the initial outlay, as well as some surplus (for example, interest, or future cash flows). An investor can decide which project to invest in by calculating each projects’ present value (using the same interest rate for each calculation) and then comparing them. The project with the smallest present value – the least initial outlay – will be chosen because it offers the same return as the other projects for the least amount of money.

== Years&#x27; purchase ==
The traditional method of valuing future income streams as a present capital sum is to multiply the average expected annual cash-flow by a multiple, known as &quot;years&#x27; purchase&quot;. For example, in selling to a third party a property leased to a tenant under a 99-year lease at a rent of $10,000 per annum, a deal might be struck at &quot;20 years&#x27; purchase&quot;, which would value the lease at 20 * $10,000, i.e. $200,000. This equates to a present value discounted in perpetuity at 5%. For a riskier investment the purchaser would demand to pay a lower number of years&#x27; purchase. This was the method used for example by the English crown in setting re-sale prices for manors seized at the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the early 16th century. The standard usage was 20 years&#x27; purchase.

<doc id="63221" wikidata="Q1991663" url="?curid=63221" title="Dissent">
<text>Dissent is an opinion, philosophy or of non-agreement or opposition to a prevailing idea or policy enforced under the authority of a government, political party or other entity or individual. A dissenting person may be referred to as a &quot;dissenter&quot;.

The term&#x27;s antonyms include &quot;&quot;, &quot;consensus&quot; (when all or nearly all parties agree on something) and &quot;consent&quot; (when one party agrees to a proposition made by another).

==Philosophical==
In philosophical skepticism, particularly that of Pyrrhonism, the existence of dissent is a rationale for suspending judgment regarding the issue associated with the dissent. Dissent in this respect appears as one of the tropes in the Five Modes of Agrippa, pointing to the uncertainty demonstrated by the differences of opinions among philosophers and people in general.

==Political==
Political dissent is a dissatisfaction with or opposition to the policies of a governing body. Expressions of dissent may take forms from vocal disagreement to civil disobedience to the use of violence. In some political systems, dissent may be formally expressed by way of opposition politics, while politically repressive regimes may prohibit any form of dissent, leading to suppression of dissent and the encouragement of social or political activism. Individuals who do not conform or support the policies of certain states are known as &quot;dissidents&quot;. Several thinkers have argued that a healthy society needs not only to protect, but also to encourage dissent.

==Religious==

===Heresy===
Heresy is any belief or theory that is strongly at variance with established beliefs or customs, in particular the accepted beliefs of a church or religious organization. A heretic is a proponent of such claims or beliefs. Heresy is distinct from both apostasy, which is the explicit renunciation of one&#x27;s religion, principles or cause, and blasphemy, which is an impious utterance or action concerning God or sacred things.

The term is usually used to refer to violations of important religious teachings, but is used also of views strongly opposed to any generally accepted ideas. It is used in particular in reference to Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.

===Schism===

A schism (pronounced , or, less commonly, ) is a division between people, usually belonging to an organization, movement, or religious denomination. The word is most frequently applied to a split in what had previously been a single religious body, such as the East–West Schism or the Great Western Schism. It is also used of a split within a non-religious organization or movement or, more broadly, of a separation between two or more people, be it brothers, friends, lovers, etc.

A &quot;schismatic&quot; is a person who creates or incites schism in an organization or who is a member of a splinter group. &quot;Schismatic&quot; as an adjective means pertaining to a schism or schisms, or to those ideas, policies, etc. that are thought to lead towards or promote schism.

In religion, the charge of schism is distinguished from that of heresy, since the offence of schism concerns not differences of belief or doctrine but promotion of, or the state of, division. However, schisms frequently involve mutual accusations of heresy. In Roman Catholic teaching, every heresy is a schism, while there may be some schisms free of the added guilt of heresy. Liberal Protestantism, however, has often preferred heresy over schism. Presbyterian scholar James I. McCord (quoted with approval by the Episcopalian Bishop of Virginia Peter Lee) drew a distinction between them, teaching: &quot;If you must make a choice between heresy and schism, always choose heresy. As a schismatic, you have torn and divided the body of Christ. Choose heresy every time.&quot;

==Military==

Officers and enlisted personnel regularly take an oral oath to support and defend the primary convening document (i.e. constitution, articles of confederation, ruling laws and statutes) and/or the supreme leader of the nation-state. There have been countless cases throughout human history where commissioned military officers and enlisted personnel—as individuals or small groups—have chosen to question and disobey the orders of their superior officers or the supreme leader of the state. Dissent by military officers falls into two main categories: violent and non-violent. In essence, when a military officer, military leader chooses to oppose the orders given to them by their superior officers or national leader, they must decide whether their counter-action will be violent or non-violent in nature and in aim.

==Judicial==

A dissenting opinion (or &quot;dissent&quot;) is an opinion in a legal case in certain legal systems written by one or more judges expressing disagreement with the majority opinion of the court which gives rise to its judgment. When not necessarily referring to a legal decision, this can also be referred to as a minority report.

Dissenting opinions are normally written at the same time as the majority opinion and any concurring opinions, and are also delivered and published at the same time. A dissenting opinion does not create binding precedent nor does it become a part of case law. Even though they can sometimes be cited as a form of persuasive authority in subsequent cases when arguing that the court&#x27;s holding should be limited or overturned. In some cases, a previous dissent is used to spur a change in the law, and a later case may result in a majority opinion adopting a particular understanding of the law formerly advocated in dissent. As with concurring opinions, the difference in opinion between dissents and majority opinions can often illuminate the precise holding of the majority opinion.

==Scientific ==

Scientific dissent is dissent from scientific consensus. Disagreements can be useful for finding problems in underlying assumptions, methodologies, and reasoning, as well as for generating and testing new ways of tackling the unknown. In modern times, with the increased role of science on the society and the politicization of science, a new aspect gained prominence: effects of scientific dissent on public policies.

Scientific dissent is distinct from denialism, which is a deliberate rejection of scientific consensus usually for commercial or ideological reasons.

==Organizational ==

Organizational dissent is the &quot;expression of disagreement or contradictory opinions about organizational practices and policies&quot;. Since dissent involves disagreement it can lead to conflict, which if not resolved, can lead to violence and struggle. As a result, many organizations send the message – verbally or nonverbally – that dissent is discouraged. However, recent studies have shown that dissent serves as an important monitoring force within organizations. Dissent can be a warning sign for employee dissatisfaction or organizational decline. Redding (1985) found that receptiveness to dissent allows for corrective feedback to monitor unethical and immoral behavior, impractical and ineffectual organizational practices and policies, poor and unfavorable decision making, and insensitivity to employees&#x27; needs and desires. Furthermore, Eilerman argues that the hidden costs of silencing dissent include: wasted and lost time, reduced decision quality, emotional and relationship costs, and decreased job motivation. Perlow (2003) found that employee resentment can lead to a decrease in productivity and creativity which can result in the organization losing money, time, and resources.

<doc id="63229" wikidata="Q183147" url="?curid=63229" title="Bee-eater">
<text>The bee-eaters are a group of birds in the family Meropidae, containing three genera and thirty-one species. Most species are found in Africa and Asia, with a few in southern Europe, Australia, and New Guinea. They are characterised by richly coloured plumage, slender bodies, and usually elongated central tail feathers. All have long down-turned bills and medium to long wings, which may be pointed or round. Male and female plumages are usually similar.

As their name suggests, bee-eaters predominantly eat flying insects, especially bees and wasps, which are caught on the wing from an open perch. The insect&#x27;s stinger is removed by repeatedly hitting and rubbing the insect on a hard surface. During this process, pressure is applied to the insect&#x27;s body, thereby discharging most of the venom.

Most bee-eaters are gregarious. They form colonies, nesting in burrows tunnelled into vertical sandy banks, often at the side of a river or in flat ground. As they mostly live in colonies, large numbers of nest holes may be seen together. The eggs are white, with typically five to the clutch. Most species are monogamous, and both parents care for their young, sometimes with assistance from related birds in the colony.

Bee-eaters may be killed by raptors; their nests are raided by rodents, weasels, martens and snakes, and they can carry various parasites. Some species are adversely affected by human activity or habitat loss, but none meet the International Union for Conservation of Nature&#x27;s vulnerability criteria, and all are therefore evaluated as &quot;least concern&quot;. Their conspicuous appearance means that they have been mentioned by ancient writers and incorporated into mythology.

==Taxonomy==

The bee-eaters were first named as a scientific group by the French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque-Schmaltz, who created the bird subfamily Meropia for these birds in 1815. The name, now modernised as Meropidae, is derived from &quot;Merops&quot;, the Ancient Greek for &quot;bee-eater&quot;, and the English term &quot;bee-eater&quot; was first recorded in 1668, referring to the European species.

The bee-eaters have been considered to be related to other families, such as the rollers, hoopoes and kingfishers, but ancestors of those families diverged from the bee-eaters at least forty million years ago, so any relationship is not close. The scarcity of fossils is unhelpful. Bee-eater fossils from the Pleistocene (2,588,000 to 11,700 years ago) have been found in Austria, and there are Holocene (from 11,700 years ago to present) specimens from Israel and Russia, but all have proved to be of the extant European bee-eater. Opinions have varied as to the bee-eater&#x27;s nearest relatives. In 2001, Fry considered the kingfishers to be the most likely, whereas a large study published in 2008 found that bee-eaters are sister to all other Coraciiformes (rollers, ground rollers, todies, motmots and kingfishers). A 2009 book supported Fry&#x27;s contention, but then a later study in 2015 suggested that the bee-eaters are sister to the rollers. The 2008 and 2015 papers both linked the kingfishers to the New World motmots.

More recent molecular phylogenetic studies have confirmed that the bee-eaters are more closely related to the rollers and ground rollers than they are to the todies, motmots and kingfishers. The relationship between the families is shown the cladogram below. The number of species in each family is taken from the list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela C. Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC).
The bee-eaters are generally similar in appearance, although they are normally divided into three genera. &quot;Nyctyornis&quot; comprises two large species with long throat feathers, the blue-bearded bee-eater and the red-bearded bee-eater, both of which have rounded wings, a ridged culmen, feathered nostrils and a relatively sluggish lifestyle. The purple-bearded bee-eater is the sole member of &quot;Meropogon&quot;, which is intermediate between &quot;Nyctyornis&quot; and the typical bee-eaters, having rounded wings and a &quot;beard&quot;, but a smooth culmen and no nostril feathers. All the remaining species are normally retained in the single genus &quot;Merops&quot;. There are close relationships within this genus, for example the red-throated bee-eater and the white-fronted bee-eater form a superspecies, but formerly suggested genera, such as &quot;Aerops&quot;, &quot;Melittophagus&quot;, &quot;Bombylonax&quot; and &quot;Dicrocercus&quot;, have not been generally accepted for several decades since a 1969 paper united them in the current arrangement.

===Species in taxonomic order===
The bee-eater family contains the following species.
The Asian green bee-eater, African green bee-eater, and Arabian green bee-eater were previously considered to be a single species, and are still treated as such by some authorities.

A 2007 nuclear and mitochondrial DNA study produced a possible phylogenetic tree, although the position of the purple-bearded bee-eater seems anomalous, in that it appears amongst &quot;Merops&quot; species.

==Description==

The bee-eaters are morphologically a fairly uniform group. They share many features with related Coraciiformes such as the kingfishers and rollers, being large-headed (although less so than their relatives), short-necked, brightly plumaged and short-legged. Their wings may be rounded or pointed, with the wing shape closely correlated with the species&#x27; preferred foraging habitat and migratory tendencies. Shorter, rounder wings are found on species that are sedentary and make typically short foraging flights in denser forests and reed-beds. Those with more elongated wings are more migratory. All the bee-eaters are highly aerial; they take off strongly from perches, fly directly without undulations, and are able to change direction quickly, although they rarely hover.

The flight feathers of the wing comprise 10 primaries, the outermost being very small, and 13 secondaries, and there are 12 tail feathers.

The bills of bee-eaters are curved, long and end in a sharp point. The bill can bite strongly, particularly at the tip, and it is used as a pair of forceps with which to snatch insects from the air and crush smaller prey. The short legs have weak feet, and when it is moving on the ground a bee-eater&#x27;s gait is barely more than a shuffle. The feet have sharp claws used for perching on vertical surfaces and also for nest excavation.

The plumage of the family is generally very bright and in most species is mainly or at least partially green, although the two carmine bee-eaters are primarily rose-coloured. Most of the &quot;Merops&quot; bee-eaters have a black bar through the eye and many have differently coloured throats and faces. The extent of the green in these species varies from almost complete in the green bee-eater to barely any green in the white-throated bee-eater. Three species, from equatorial Africa, have no green at all in their plumage, the black bee-eater, the blue-headed bee-eater and the rosy bee-eater. Many species have elongated central tail feathers.

There is little visible difference between the sexes in most of the family, although in several species the iris is red in the males and brown-red in the females, and in species with tail-streamers these may be slightly longer in males. Both the European and red-bearded bee-eaters have sex-based differences in their plumage colour, and the female rainbow bee-eater has shorter tail streamers than the male, which terminate in a club-shape that he lacks. There may be instances where bee-eaters are sexually dichromatic at the ultraviolet part of the colour spectrum, which humans cannot see. A study of blue-tailed bee-eater found that males were more colourful than females in UV light. Their overall colour was also affected by body condition, suggesting that there was a signalling component to plumage colour. Juveniles are generally similar to adults, except for the two &quot;Nyctyornis&quot; species, in which the young have mainly green plumage.

Bee-eaters have calls that are characteristic for each species. Most sound simple to the human ear, but show significant variability when studied in detail, carrying significant information for the birds.

==Distribution and habitat==

The bee-eaters have an Old World distribution, occurring from Europe to Australia. The centre of diversity of the family is Africa, although a number of species also occur in Asia. Single species occur in each of Europe, (the European bee-eater), Australia (the rainbow bee-eater) and Madagascar (the olive bee-eater, also found on mainland Africa). Of the three genera, &quot;Merops&quot;, which has the majority of the species, occurs across the entirety of the family&#x27;s distribution. &quot;Nyctyornis&quot; is restricted to Asia, ranging from India and southern China to the Indonesian islands of Sumatra and Borneo. The genus &quot;Meropogon&quot; has a single species restricted to Sulawesi in Indonesia.

Bee-eaters are fairly indiscriminate in their choice of habitat. Their requirements are simply an elevated perch from which to watch for prey and a suitable ground substrate in which to dig their breeding burrow. Because their prey is entirely caught on the wing they are not dependent on any vegetation type. A single species, the blue-headed bee-eater, is found inside closed rainforest where it forages close to the ground in poor light in the gaps between large trees. Six other species are also closely associated with rainforest, but occur in edge habitat such as along rivers, in tree-fall gaps, off trees overhanging ravines or on emergent tree crowns above the main canopy.

Species that breed in subtropical or temperate areas of Europe, Asia and Australia are all migratory. The European bee-eaters that breed in southern Europe and Asia migrate to West and southern Africa. Another population of the same species breeds in South Africa and Namibia; these birds move northwards after breeding. In Australia the rainbow bee-eater is migratory in the southern areas of its range, migrating to Indonesia and New Guinea, but occurs year-round in northern Australia. Several species of bee-eater, are intra-African migrants; the white-throated bee-eater, for example, breeds on the southern edge of the Sahara and winters further south in equatorial rainforest. The most unusual migration is that of the southern carmine bee-eater, which has a three-stage migration; after breeding in a band between Angola and Mozambique it moves south to Botswana, Namibia and South Africa before moving north to its main wintering grounds in northern Angola, Congo and Tanzania.

==Behaviour==

The bee-eaters are diurnal, although a few species may migrate during the night if the terrain &quot;en route&quot; is unsuitable for stopping or if they are crossing the sea. Bee-eaters are highly social, and pairs sitting or roosting together are often so close that they touch (an individual distance of zero). Many species are colonial in the breeding season and some species are also highly gregarious when not nesting.

The social structures of the red-throated bee-eater and the white-fronted bee-eaters have been described as more complex than for any other bird species. The birds exist in colonies located on nesting cliffs, and have a stable structure all year round. These colonies typically contain five to 50 burrows, occasionally up to 200, and are composed of clans of two or three pairs, their helpers, and their offspring. The helpers are male offspring from a previous year. Within the colony, the males alternate between guarding their mate and attempting to make forced copulations with other females. The females in turn attempt to lay eggs in their neighbour&#x27;s nests, an example of brood parasitism. Some individuals also specialise in kleptoparasitism, stealing prey collected by other colony members. The colony&#x27;s daily routine is to emerge from the nesting holes or roosting branches soon after dawn, preen and sun themselves for an hour, then disperse to feed. Feeding territories are divided by clan, with each clan defending its territory from all others of the same species, including clans of the same colony. The clans return to the colony before dusk, and engage in more social behaviour before retiring for the night. Colonies are situated several hundred metres apart and have little to do with each other, although young individuals may disperse between colonies. As such, these species can be thought to have four tiers of social kinship: the individual pair, the family unit, the clan, and the colony as a whole.

Bee-eaters spend around 10% of their day on comfort activities. These include sunning themselves, dust bathing and water bathing. Sunning behaviour helps warm birds in the morning, reducing the need to use energy to raise their temperature. It also has a social aspect, as multiple birds adopt the same posture. Finally, it may help stimulate parasites in the feathers, making them easier to find and remove. Due to their hole-nesting lifestyle, bee-eaters accumulate a number of external parasites such as mites and flies. Together with sunning, bouts of dust bathing (or water bathing where available), as well as rigorous preening, keep the feathers and skin in good health. Bathing with water involves making shallow dives into a water body and then returning to a perch to preen.

===Diet and feeding===

The bee-eaters are almost exclusively aerial hunters of insect prey. Prey is caught either on the wing or more commonly from an exposed perch from which the bee-eater watches for prey. Smaller, rounder-winged bee-eaters typically hunt from branches and twigs closer to the ground, whereas the larger species hunt from tree tops or telephone wires. One unusual technique often used by carmine bee-eaters is to ride on the backs of bustards.

Prey can be spotted from a distance; European bee-eaters are able to spot a bee away, and blue-cheeked bee-eaters have been observed flying out to catch large wasps. Prey is approached directly or from behind. Prey that lands on the ground or on plants is usually not pursued. Small prey may be eaten on the wing, but larger items are returned to the perch where they are beaten until dead and then broken up. Insects with poisonous stings are first smacked on the branch, then, with the bird&#x27;s eyes closed, rubbed to discharge the venom sac and stinger. This behaviour is innate, as demonstrated by a juvenile bird in captivity, which performed the task when first presented with wild bees. This bird was stung on the first five tries, but by ten bees, it was as adept at handling bees as adult birds.

Bee-eaters consume a wide range of insects; beyond a few distasteful butterflies they consume almost any insect from tiny &quot;Drosophila&quot; flies to large beetles and dragonflies. At some point bee-eaters have been recorded eating beetles, mayflies, stoneflies, cicadas, termites, crickets and grasshoppers, mantises, true flies and moths. For many species, the dominant prey item are stinging members of the order Hymenoptera, namely wasps and bees. In a survey of 20 studies, the proportion of the diet made up by bees and wasps varied from 20% to 96%, with the average being 70%. Of these honeybees can comprise a large part of the diet, as much as 89% of the overall intake. The preference for bees and wasps may have arisen because of the numerical abundance of these suitably sized insects. The giant honeybee is a particularly commonly eaten species. These bees attempt to congregate in a mass defence against the bee-eaters. In Israel, a European bee-eater was documented attempting to eat a small bat that it had caught, which probably could not fit down its throat.

Like kingfishers, bee-eaters regurgitate pellets of undigested material, typically long black oblongs.

==== Predation of honey bees ====
If an apiary is set up close to a bee-eater colony, a larger number of honey bees are eaten because they are more abundant. However, studies show the bee-eaters do not intentionally fly into the apiary, rather they feed on the insects caught on pastures and meadows within a radius of from the colony, this maximum distance being reached only when there is a shortage of food. Observations show that the birds actually enter the apiary only in cold and rainy periods, when the bees do not leave the hive and other insect prey are harder for the bee-eaters to detect.

Many bee-keepers believe that the bee-eaters are the main obstacle causing worker bees not to forage, and instead stay inside the hives for much of the day between May and the end of August. However, a study carried out in a eucalyptus forest in the Alaluas region in the Murqub District in Libya, east of Tripoli, showed that the bee-eaters were not the main obstacle to bee foraging; in some cases, the foraging rate was higher in the presence of the birds than in their absence. The average bird meal consisted of 90.8% honey bees and 9.2% beetles.

Predation is more likely when the bees are queening or during the peak of migration, from late March till mid-April, and in mid-September. Hives close to or under trees or overhead cables are at increased risk as the birds pounce on flying insects from these perches.

===Breeding===
Bee-eaters are monogamous during a nesting season, and in sedentary species, pairs may stay together for multiple years. Migratory bee-eaters may find new mates each breeding season. The courtship displays of the bee-eaters are rather unspectacular, with some calling and raising of throat and wing feathers. The exception is the performance of the white-throated bee-eater. Their &quot;butterfly display&quot; involves both members of a pair performing a gliding display flight with shallow wing-beats; they then perch facing each other, raising and folding their wings while calling. Most members of the family engage in courtship feeding, where the male presents prey items to the female, and such feeding can account for much, if not all, of the energy females require for egg creation.

Like almost all Coraciiformes the bee-eaters are cavity nesters. In the case of the bee-eaters the nests are burrows dug into the ground, either into the sides of earth cliffs or directly into level soil. Both types of nesting site are vulnerable, those on level ground are vulnerable to trampling and small predators, whereas those in cliffs, which are often the banks of rivers, are vulnerable to flash floods, which can wipe out dozens or hundreds of nests. Many species will nest either on cliffs or on level ground but prefer cliffs, although Böhm&#x27;s bee-eater always nests on level ground. The burrows are dug by both birds in the pair, sometimes assisted by helpers. The soil or sand is loosened with jabs of the sharp bill, then the feet are used to kick out the loose soil. It has been suggested that riverine loess deposits that do not crumble when excavated may be favoured by the larger bee-eaters. There may be several false starts where nests are dug partway before being abandoned; in solitary species this can give the impression of colonial living even when that is not the case. The process of nest building can take as long as twenty days to complete, during which time the bill can be blunted and shortened. Nests are generally used only for a single season and are rarely used twice by the bee-eaters, but abandoned nests may be used by other birds, snakes and bats as shelter and breeding sites.

No nesting material is used in the breeding cavity. One white egg is laid each day until the typical clutch of about five eggs is complete. Incubation starts soon after the first egg is laid, with both parents sharing this duty in the day, but only the female at night. The eggs hatch in about 20 days, and the newly hatched young are blind, pink and naked. For most species, the eggs do not all hatch at the same time, so if food is in short supply only the older chicks survive. Adults and young defecate in the nest, and their pellets are trodden underfoot, making the nest cavity very malodorous. The chicks are in the nest for about 30 days.

Bee-eaters may nest as single pairs, loose colonies or dense colonies. Smaller species tend to nest solitarily, while medium-sized bee-eaters have small colonies, and larger and migratory species nest in large colonies that can number in the thousands. In some instances, colonies may contain more than one species of bee-eater. In species that nest gregariously, breeding pairs may be assisted by up to five helpers. These birds may alternate between breeding themselves and helping in successive years.

==Predators and parasites==
Bee-eater nests may be raided by rats and snakes, and the adults are hunted by birds of prey such as the Levant sparrowhawk. The little bee-eater and red-throated bee-eaters are hosts of the greater honeyguide and the lesser honeyguide, both brood parasites. The young honeyguides kill the bee-eater&#x27;s chicks and destroy any eggs. The begging call of the honeyguide sounds like &quot;two&quot; bee-eater chicks, ensuring a good supply of food from the adult bee-eaters.

Bee-eaters may be infested by several blood-feeding flies of the genus &quot;Carnus&quot;, and the biting fly &quot;Ornithophila metallica&quot;. Other parasites include chewing lice of the genera &quot;Meromenopon&quot;, &quot;Brueeliaa&quot; and &quot;Meropoecus&quot;, some of which are specialist parasites of bee-eaters, and the stickfast flea &quot;Echidnophaga gallinacea&quot;. The hole-nesting lifestyle of bee-eaters means that they tend to carry a higher burden of external parasites than non-hole-nesting bird species. Bee-eaters may also be infected by protozoan blood parasites of the genus &quot;Haemoproteus&quot; including &quot;H. meropis&quot;.

Fly larvae of the genus &quot;Fannia&quot; live in the nests of at least European bee-eaters, and feed on faeces and food remains. Their presence and cleaning activities appear to benefit the developing bee-eaters.

==Status==
The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) assesses species vulnerability in terms of total population and the rate of any population decline. None of the bee-eaters meet the IUCN vulnerability criteria, and all are therefore evaluated as &quot;Least-concern species&quot;.

Open country species, which comprise the majority of bee-eaters, have mostly expanded in range as more land is converted to agriculture, but some tropical forest species have suffered declines through loss of habitat, although no species or subspecies gives serious cause for concern. There is some human persecution of bee-eaters, with nest holes being blocked, adults shot or limed, or young taken for food. More generally problematic is the unintended destruction of nests. This can occur through cattle trampling, as with the blue-headed bee-eater in Kenya, or loss of forests, with massive conversion of native forest to oil palm plantations in Malaysia being particularly concerning.

A study of the southern carmine bee-eater in Zimbabwe showed that it was affected by deliberate interference and persecution and loss of woodlands, and that nesting sites are lost through poor water management leading to river bank damage, dam construction and panning for gold. Colonies are becoming concentrated into the national parks and the Zambezi Valley. The well-studied European bee-eater is trapped and shot on migration in countries bordering the Mediterranean, an estimated 4,000–6,000 annually being killed in Cyprus alone, but with a global population of between 170,000 and 550,000 pairs even losses on that scale make little overall impact.

==In culture==
Bee-eaters were mentioned by ancient writers such as Aristotle and Virgil, who both advised beekeepers to kill the birds. Aristotle knew that bee-eaters nested at the end of tunnels up to long and the size of their clutch. He said that nesting adults were fed by their own young, based on the observed actual help at the nest by related birds.

In Greek mythology, the Theban Botres was fatally struck by his father when he desecrated a ritual sacrifice of a ram to the god Apollo by tasting the victim&#x27;s brains. The god took pity on him, turning him into a bee-eater.

The Ancient Egyptians believed that bee-eaters had medical properties, prescribing the application of bee-eater fat to deter biting flies, and treating the eyes with the smoke from charred bee-eater legs to cure an unspecified female complaint.

In Hinduism, the shape of the bird in flight was thought to resemble a bow, with the long bill as an arrow. This led to a Sanskrit name meaning &quot;Vishnu&#x27;s bow&quot; and an association with archer gods. Scandalmongers were thought to be reincarnated as bee-eaters, because of the metaphorical poison they bore in their mouths.

Depictions in classical art are rare for such striking birds. The only known Ancient Egyptian example is a relief, probably of a little green bee-eater, on a wall of Queen Hatshepsut&#x27;s mortuary temple, and an early Roman mural depicting blue-cheeked bee-eaters was found in the villa of Agrippina. Bee-eaters have been depicted on the postage stamps of at least 38 countries, the European and Carmine bee-eaters being the most common subjects, with 18 and 11 countries respectively.

<text>Skiing in Victoria, Australia takes place in the Australian Alps located in the State of Victoria during the southern hemisphere winter. Victoria is the State with the greatest number of ski resorts in Australia. The highest peak in Victoria is Mount Bogong at 1986m. The first ski tow was constructed near Mount Buffalo in 1938. Victoria has a number of well developed ski resorts including Mount Hotham, Falls Creek and Mount Buller. Cross country skiing is popular in such national parks as Mount Buffalo National Park and Alpine National Park.

==Overview==

A hospice was built at Mount Saint Bernard (Elevation 1540) around 1863 along a track developed to link the Victorian gold fields. Snowshoes were developed locally to assist winter travellers and a larger hospice built around 1884. Recreational and practical skiing was being practised in the area by the 1880s and 90s with skis made from local timbers, and making use of single steering poles. The first winter traverse of the Victorian Alps was made in 1900, via the Hospice and Mount Hotham. The Hospice operated as a recreational ski location into the 1930s, but was destroyed by bushfire in 1939.

Skiing began at Mount Buffalo in the 1890s and the Mount Buffalo Chalet in Victoria was constructed in 1910. Australia&#x27;s first ski tow was constructed near Mount Buffalo in 1938. Buffalo&#x27;s first ski lodge was built at Dingo Dell in 1954. A bushfire in 2006 forced the temporary closure of the resort and negotiations are continuing over a new lease on the property. A stone cottage was built at Mount Hotham in 1925 to cater for a growing interest in sport of skiing and a Club was built in 1944 with the first ski tow installed in 1951. A ski hut was erected at Mount Baw Baw, just 120 km East of Melbourne, in 1945 and a ski rope tow added in 1955. The first ski lift went into service at Mount Buller in 1949, and in the same year rope tow was installed at Falls Creek. In 1957, Australia&#x27;s first chairlift was installed at Falls Creek, and the area is today the largest ski resort in Victoria.

The Mount Buller Interschools Event claims to be the largest interdisciplinary snow-sports event on earth. In 2008 it attracted 3500 participants.

Snow play is also available at Mount Donna Buang.

===Cross Country &amp; Back Country Skiing===


Dedicated Cross Country ski resorts are located at Lake Mountain, Mount Stirling and Mount St Gwinear in Victoria and popular areas for back country skiing and ski touring in the Alpine National Park, Yarra Ranges National Park and the Baw Baw National Park include: Mount Bogong, Mount Feathertop, Bogong High Plains, Mount Howitt, Mount Reynard and Snowy Plains. The Kangaroo Hoppet is a leg of the Worldloppet cross-country race series which is conducted on the last Saturday of August each year, hosted by Falls Creek in Victoria. The showpiece 42-kilometre race attracts thousands of spectators and competitors.

The Australian High Country is populated by unique flora and fauna including wombats, wallabies, echidnas, and the Snow Gum. The Alpine regions are subject to environmental protection, which has limited the scope of commercial development of skiable terrain, however Australia has extensive cross country skiing terrain.

<doc id="63231" wikidata="Q1950297" url="?curid=63231" title="Budj Bim National Park">
<text>The Budj Bim National Park, formerly known as Mount Eccles National Park, is a national park located in the Western District of Victoria, Australia. The national park is situated approximately west of Melbourne and approximately southwest of Macarthur. It derives its name from the Budj Bim volcano, formerly Mount Eccles, which is situated in the north-east of the park.

The park now forms part of the larger Budj Bim heritage areas of both national and world significance, due to the extensive systems of aquaculture created by Aboriginal Australians thousands of years ago and the significance of the area to the Gunditjmara people.

==Features==
Located within the national park is Budj Bim, formerly named Mount Eccles by the European people who settled in the area, is the site of one of the most recent active volcanos in Australia. The first activity was about 40,000 years ago when Budj Bim was formed by lava pouring out the Earth&#x27;s crust. The most recent eruption was approximately 8,000 years ago. Budj Bim is a fairly small hill surrounded by lush vegetation with a small, hidden, deep volcanic crater lake named Lake Surprise. It is famous for an adjacent lava tube and there are numerous lava tubes in the surrounding farm land.

==Heritage areas==

The park was added to the Australian National Heritage List in 2004 as part of the Budj Bim National Heritage Landscape for its importance in Indigenous history and its geology.

As one of three components of the Budj Bim Cultural Landscape, it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List on 6 July 2019.

==Management==
 Budj Bim National Park, as part of the Budj Bim National Heritage Landscape, is jointly managed by Parks Victoria, the (Gunditjmara) Gunditj Mirring Traditional Owners Aboriginal Corporation (GMTOAC) and Winda-Mara TOAC (a south-west Victorian organisation representing Indigenous Australians in the area). The Council forms part of the 2007 Native Title Settlement Agreement between the Gunditjmara and the Victorian Government, under which both parties manage the park landscape.

==2020 bushfires==
During the 2019-2020 Australian bushfire season, fires broke out within the Budj Bim Cultural Heritage Landscape. The stone fish traps and the stone house site were unaffected by fire, and fortunately the fires were quickly contained, partly due to mild weather conditions and partly by the efforts of firefighters. Lake Condah and Condah Mission were not directly affected by the fires. In the National Park, the campground and picnic area reopened from 29 February 2020, but the Lake Surprise walking track and access to Tunnel Cave were closed due to the impact of the fires. , the Crater Rim Walk and Lava Canal Walk are open, but re-routed near Tunnel Cave.

On 4 November 1898 an area of was reserved around the plateau and Eurobin Falls as Mount Buffalo National Park, making it one of the oldest national parks in Australia. In 1908 a road was opened to the plateau and the park was expanded to ; and in 1980 to its current size to take in most of the surrounding foothill country.

On 7 November 2008, the park was added to the Australian National Heritage List as one of eleven areas constituting the Australian Alps National Parks and Reserves.

==Location and features==
Mount Buffalo is a moderately tall mountain plateau on the west side of the Victorian Alpine region. The top of the mountain has striking granite boulders and rock formations. From the north, the mountain is quite remarkable, with the highest accessible point being a prominent peak called The Horn. A walking track leads to The Horn and visitors can enjoy a 360 degree view from the top.

Visitor accommodation was available at the historic guest house, the Mount Buffalo Chalet, built in 1910, until January 2007. Parks Victoria and the Victorian Government undertook restoration work on the exterior and gardens of the Chalet in 2017 and 2018. The chalet overlooks large sheets of granite and has views of the Ovens Valley and Buckland Valley below.

Tatra Inn, a lodge located at the west end of the plateau near the cathedral, was destroyed in 2006 by an escaped fuel reduction burn. This is a rock climbing, abseiling and hang-gliding site, and there is adventure caving at Mount Buffalo. The camping ground at Lake Catani is open from November to April.

During the winter season, Mount Buffalo is a destination for cross-country skiing. There are a number of cross-country ski trails near the cathedral (Cresta), and toboggan runs at Dingo Dell and Cresta Valley, both of which are used by beginners. Cross-country lessons and many cross-country trails for more experienced skiers are also available. Visitors stay in the nearby towns of Porepunkah and Bright.

==History==

Mitambuta and Taungurung people climbed Mount Buffalo in summer to feast on protein-rich bogong moths, and also to meet and hold ceremonies.

Explorers Hume and Hovell named the mountain in 1824 because of its supposed resemblance to a reclining buffalo. Gold miners and botanists later visited the area. With the beginning of tourism in the 1880s, an area around the Gorge was reserved as a national park in 1898. The park has been enlarged several times since and now takes in all the plateau and surrounding slopes. The Mount Buffalo Chalet was built in 1910, soon after the first road to the plateau was constructed, replacing some earlier more &quot;rustic&quot; accommodation. The park became a holiday destination for succeeding generations and a place for early skiing and ice skating ventures. Mount Buffalo had the first ski tow in Australia.

When the Mount Buffalo Chalet was run by the Victorian Railways the restaurant was known as an official &quot;Railways Refreshment Room&quot;. Staff worked in railway uniforms, blew whistles and imposed curfews for guests. Railway tickets were issued for equipment and activities such as &quot;Motor to Wangaratta&quot; and &quot;Skis, steel edged with cane stocks and boots 2nd Grade 8/6-&quot;.

In late 2006, during the early stages of the huge 2006-07 Victorian Alps Fire Complex, bushfires raged through parts of the national park. The fires destroyed the Cresta Lodge, however the historic Chalet was saved despite being thought to be under threat.

==Fauna==
Due to the range in altitude in the park, there are a variety of fauna habitats. The foothill forests contain kangaroos, wallabies, and several species of possums and sugar gliders. Smaller mammals such as native rats and mice inhabit the plateau. Wombats occur in all habitats. The alpine silver xenica is a species of butterfly found only on the plateau of Mount buffalo. Bogong moths shelter in rock crevices at the horn and it is common to see birds darting in and out of the cracks to feed on them during the day and bats doing the same at night. Peregrine falcons sometimes nest in the granite rock faces. Crimson rosellas are abundant throughout the park.
==Climate==

Climate data are sourced from Mount Buffalo Chalet, situated at an altitude of . An extreme winter rainfall peak is noted, with a large quantity falling as heavy snow.

==Vegetation==

Over 550 native species occur; the most significant vegetation communities are the alpine and sub-alpine communities. The lower slopes have communities of mixed gum and peppermint, including the bogong gum (&quot;Eucalyptus chapmaniana&quot;). These grade into pure stands of alpine ash (&quot;Eucalyptus delegatensis&quot;) around elevation, and subalpine woodland of snow gum, (&quot;Eucalyptus pauciflora&quot;) above . The majority of the plateau is at an elevation of , where inverted treelines in valley bottoms give rise to grasslands, with bog and fen communities of &quot;Sphagnum&quot; and &quot;Empodisma&quot; in watercourses.

The endemic eucalypt &quot;Eucalyptus mitchelliana&quot;, the Buffalo sallee, is found on higher granite outcrops. Other endemic plants are &quot;Grevillea alpivaga&quot; (Buffalo grevillea), &quot;Acacia phlebophylla&quot; (Buffalo sallow wattle), and &quot;Babingtonia crenulata&quot; (fern-leaf baeckea). The rare &quot;Pratia gelida&quot;, snow pratia, occurs in a small area on Hospice Plain.

Grazing was excluded from the park in 1957, one of the earliest exclusions of this activity in any alpine park. Weed species, particularly Himalayan honeysuckle, yarrow and blackberries, pose a continuing management challenge.

==Fungi==

Mount Buffalo National Park is also home to an enormous diversity of fungi. Fungi are ecologically important and megadiverse, yet their significance in underpinning the terrestrial ecology of the park is little recognised. The park also contains a great variety of lichens (which are classified as fungi), many of which are important pioneer species, and some of which are restricted to alpine habitats.

Although the Management Plan for Mount Buffalo National Park makes no reference to fungi, the park has a great variety of fungi that perform beneficial ecological roles. As primary recyclers of organic matter, saprobic fungi break down fallen branches and leaf litter, making vital nutrients available to other organisms. Other fungi form symbiotic relationships with other organisms. Although rarely acknowledged, the great majority of plants in Mount Buffalo National Park (indeed in the world) form mutually beneficial mycorrhizal relationships with fungi.

Given the great diversity of plants, specialist habitats and micro-climates in the park, a great diversity of fungi, including lichens, is also expected to occur there. Several hundred fungal species have already been recorded by field naturalists and interested individuals and a list can be found in the Atlas of Living Australia. &quot;Leotia lubrica&quot; commonly known as the jelly baby grows in leaf litter, moss and soils in the wetter parts of the park. The yellow gelatinous fruitbodies typically grows in clumps. The rhubarb bolete, &quot;Boletellus obscurecoccineus&quot; is a distinctive species that grows in soils in association with &quot;Eucalyptus&quot; species. The Australian citizen-science organisation, Fungimap is documenting and mapping the distribution of fungi including those that occur in national parks.

Despite their essential roles in supporting ecosystems, fungi are barely recognised as a vital part of Australia&#x27;s biodiversity. Although Australia has national and state level biodiversity conservation strategies there is currently no statewide biodiversity strategy for managing biodiversity in Victoria and the Alpine Shire Council&#x27;s homepage section on Environmental Protectio n contains no reference to the protection of fungi.

==Road cycling==

Mount Buffalo is a popular destination for road cyclists due to the challenging yet scenic climb to the top of the mountain. From the now defunct tollbooth at the base of the mountain to the Mount Buffalo Chalet it&#x27;s a 20.9 km climb at an average gradient of 4.8%. The climb can be extended by following the road around to the right at the Chalet turn-off and continuing to Dingo Dell or The Horn.

<text>The Grampians National Park, commonly known as the Grampians, is a national park located in the Grampians region of Victoria, Australia. The Jardwadjali name for the mountain range itself is Gariwerd.

The national park is situated between and on the Western Highway and on the Glenelg Highway, west of Melbourne and east of Adelaide. Proclaimed as a national park on 1 July 1984, the park was listed on the National Heritage List on 15 December 2006 for its outstanding natural beauty and being one of the richest Aboriginal rock art sites in south-eastern Australia.

The Grampians feature a striking series of mountain ranges of sandstone. The Gariwerd area features about 90% of the rock art in the state.

==Etymology==
At the time of European colonisation, the Grampians had a number of indigenous names, one of which was &quot;Gariwerd&quot; in the western Kulin language of the Mukjarawaint, Jardwadjali, and Djab Wurrung people, who lived in the area and who shared 90 per cent of their vocabulary.

According to historian Benjamin Wilkie, the name &quot;Gariwerd&quot; was first written down in 1841, taken from a Jardwadjali speaker by the Chief Protector of Aborigines, George Augustus Robinson, as &quot;Currewurt&quot;. From speakers of the Djab Wurrung language or Djargurd Wurrung language, to the east, he recorded &quot;Erewurrr, country of the Grampians&quot; – likely a mishearing of &quot;Gariwerd&quot;. Recorded variations on &quot;Gariwerd&quot; include &quot;Cowa&quot;, &quot;Gowah&quot;, and &quot;Gar&quot; – generic words for a pointed mountain. Dhauwurd Wurrung language speakers from the south-west coast of Victoria called the mountains &quot;Murraibuggum&quot;, while Wathawurrung (Wathaurong) speakers used the name &quot;Tolotmutgo&quot;.

In 1836, the explorer and Surveyor General of New South Wales Sir Thomas Mitchell named &quot;Gariwerd&quot; after the Grampian Mountains in his native Scotland. According to Wilkie, Mitchell first referred to &quot;Gariwerd&quot; as the &quot;Coast Mountains&quot; and, in July 1836, called them the &quot;Gulielmian Mountains&quot; after William IV of the United Kingdom (&quot;Gulielmi IV Regis)&quot;. Members of his expedition referred to the mountains as the &quot;Gulielmean&quot;, &quot;Gulielman&quot;, and the &quot;Blue Gulielmean Mountains&quot;. Later in 1836, Mitchell settled on &quot;Grampians&quot;, and the &quot;Grampians National Park&quot; took that name in 1984.

After a two-year consultation process, the park was renamed Grampians (Gariwerd) National Park in 1991, but that proved controversial and was reversed after the election of the Kennett government in 1992. The 1998 &quot;Geographic Place Names Act&quot; reinstated the dual naming of geographical features, and that has been subsequently adopted in the park, based on Jardwadjali and Djab Wurrung names for rock art sites and landscape features, with the Australian National Heritage List referring to &quot;Grampians National Park (Gariwerd)&quot;.

==Physiography==
This area is a distinct physiographic section of the larger Western Victorian Highlands province, which, in turn, is part of the larger East Australian Cordillera physiographic division — commonly known as the Great Dividing Range — a series of mountain ranges, plateaus and rolling hills forming out of the Wimmera plains just to the west of the Grampians, staying close to the east Australian coastline and extending 4,000 km (2,500 miles) to the north to Dauan Island in the Torres Strait off the northern tip of the Cape York Peninsula.

===Geography===

The general form that the ranges take is: from the west, a series of low-angled sandstone ridges running roughly north–south. The eastern sides of the ridges, where the sedimentary layers have faulted, are steep and beyond the vertical in place - notably at Hollow Mountain near Dadswells Bridge at the northern end of the ranges.

===Geology===
The rock material that composes the high peaks is sandstone which was laid down from rivers during the Devonian period 425 - 415 million years ago. This sediment slowly accumulated to a depth of ; this was later raised and tilted for its present form. 
A number of stratigraphic layers have been identified, such as the Silverband Formation, the Mount Difficult Subgroup and the Red Man Bluff Subgroup. The coarse grain and fine lamination of the Silverstone Formation, along with undulations at the surface, is thought to have been an estuarine backwater before becoming preserved around 400 million years ago.

The Southern Ocean reached the base of the northern and western edges of the mountain range about 40 million years ago, the deposition from the range forming the sea floor which is now Little Desert National Park.

The highest peak is Mount William at . Numerous waterfalls, such as Mackenzie Falls, are found in the park and are easily accessible via a well-developed road network.

==Climate==

Due to being an exposed peak in the west of Victoria, Mount William features especially cool maximum temperatures throughout the year. Winter cloud cover is profound; with an extraordinary 26 days of precipitation in July, constituting an annual total of 215 days—quite possibly the highest figure of any site in mainland Australia.

Snowfalls are both frequent and heavy throughout the year. Daily maximum temperatures can struggle above the single digits even in summer, and on such days the afternoon and mid-day readings can be near to in extreme cases such as in December 2022. The peak can be classed as a cold and moist Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csb&quot;) on account of the low summer rainfall − in February averaging only of rain.

==Cultural heritage==
===Evidence of vertebrate life===
The Silverband Formation (see Geology above) was the source of sandstone paving slabs used for the construction of a nearby Cobb &amp; Co station in 1873. The surface of one paver contained 23 impressions, the tracks of a four-legged animal around in length, which have been described as the oldest trace of a vertebrate walking on land.

===Aboriginal Australian heritage===
To the Jardwadjali and Djab Wurrung peoples, &quot;Gariwerd&quot; was central to the dreaming of the creator, Bunjil, and &quot;buledji Brambimbula&quot;, the two brothers Bram, who were responsible for the creation and naming of many landscape features in western Victoria.

Grampians National Park (Gariwerd) is one of the richest Indigenous rock art sites in south-eastern Australia and was listed on the National Heritage List for its natural beauty as well as its past and continuing Aboriginal cultural associations. Motifs painted in numerous caves include depictions of humans, human hands, animal tracks and birds. Notable rock art sites include:
*Billimina (Glenisla shelter)
*Jananginj Njani (Camp of the Emu&#x27;s Foot)
*Manja (Cave of Hands)
*Larngibunja (Cave of Fishes)
*Ngamadjidj (Cave of Ghosts - the same word as that used for white people)
*Gulgurn Manja (Flat Rock)

The rock art was created by Jardwadjali and Djab Wurrung peoples, and while Aboriginal communities continue to pass on knowledge and cultural traditions, much Indigenous knowledge has also been lost since European settlement of the area from 1840. The significance of the right hand prints at Gulgurn Manja is now unknown.

One of the most significant Aboriginal cultural sites in south-eastern Australia is Bunjil&#x27;s Shelter, not within the park area, but in Black Range Scenic Reserve near Stawell. It is the only known rock art depiction of Bunjil, the creator-being in Aboriginal Australian mythology.

Dual naming of features has been adopted in the park based on Jardwadjali and Djab Wurrung names for rock art sites and landscape features, including:
* Grampians / Gariwerd (mountain range)
* Mount Zero / Mura Mura (little hill)
* Halls Gap / Budja Budja
* Mount Stapylton / Gunigalg
* Mount Difficult / Gar

==Recreation==

&quot;Gariwerd&quot; and the Grampians National Park has been a popular destination for recreation and tourism since the middle of the nineteenth century. According to Wilkie, the extension of railways to nearby Stawell, Ararat and Dunkeld were an important factor in the mountains&#x27; increasing popularity in the early twentieth century; growing car ownership and the construction of tourist roads in the ranges during the 1920s were also significant.

=== Gliding ===
Mount William is known within the gliding community for the &quot;Grampians Wave&quot;, a weather phenomenon that sometimes enables glider pilots to reach extreme altitudes of the order of . This predominantly occurs during the months of May, June, September and October when strong westerly winds flow at right angles to the ridge, and produce a large-scale standing wave.

===Rock climbing===
The Grampians is a famous rock climbing destination, with the first routes being established in the 1960s. Notable routes include &quot;The Wheel of Life&quot; (V15 / 35) and &quot;Groove Train&quot; (33) which attract world class climbers. Australian adventurer Jon Muir regards the Grampians, along with the Arapiles, as near perfect in their combination of access, climate and type of rock.

In March 2019, 30% of climbing areas were closed by Parks Victoria due to cultural and ecological concerns, namely bolting, chalk marks, and making access paths through vegetation. It closed 70% of bouldering routes, and 50% of sport climbing.

Parks Victoria were accused by climbers of exaggerating damage and acting heavy handedly by pitting them against traditional owners, of whom they are &quot;natural allies&quot;. Jon Muir and renowned Australian mountaineer Tim Macartney-Snape have criticised Parks Victoria’s handling of the situation, with Muir saying, “The climbers haven’t really been taken into the equation”, and Macartney-Snape saying, “It’s really the way it has been managed. It’s a blight on Australian administration of natural land.”

===Bushwalking===
In 2015 Parks Victoria started building the 164 km Grampians Peaks Trail. The trail, which takes inspiration from popular Tasmanian trails, is designed to take 13 days to walk and crosses the length of the park. It was officially opened on 12 November 2021.

The most popular walking area for day trippers is the Wonderland area near Halls Gap. In summer the ranges can get very hot and dry. Winter and spring are the best times for walking. The Wonderland area is also host to &quot;The Grand Canyon&quot; on the &quot;Wonderland Loop&quot; on one of the tracks to the &quot;Pinnacle&quot;.

In spring, the Grampians wildflowers are an attraction. Colloquially known as the ‘garden of Victoria’, the Grampians is home to 975 native plant species (including more than 75 orchid species), representing one third of the total Victorian flora, and many of these species are only found in the Grampians, including the Grampians pincushion lily (Borya mirabilis), one of the rarest native lilies in Australia.

===Tourist centres===
Halls Gap / &quot;Budja Budja&quot; is the largest service town in the area and is located at a point roughly equidistant between the towns of Ararat and Stawell. The town is located towards the eastern side of the park and offers accommodation to the many tourists who visit the area.

The &quot;Brambuk National Park and Cultural Centre&quot; in Halls Gap is owned and managed by Jardwadjali and Djab Wurrung people from five Aboriginal communities with historic links to the Gariwerd-Grampians ranges and the surrounding plains.

===Food and Wine Festival===
Grampians National Park is home to one of Australia&#x27;s longest running food and wine festivals, Grampians Grape Escape, held over the first weekend of May in Halls Gap every year. Launched in 1992, the Grampians Grape Escape is a hallmark event for Victoria and provides food and wine offerings by more than 100 local artisan producers, live music and family entertainment.

==Natural disasters==
Lightning caused a major bushfire that burned out about 127,000 ha (47%) of the Grampians National Park in January 2006. Soon afterwards the first signs of regeneration were already visible with, for example, regrowth of the eucalyptus trees. Many trees exhibit epicormic growth, where a mass of young shoots re-sprout along the whole length of the trunk to the base of the tree. Major flooding followed 5 years later in January 2011, forcing the closure of some parts of the Grampians National Park for several months.

Furthermore since 2006, the Grampians National Park has experienced another two large-scale fires, both caused by lightning. These fires have impacted roughly 85% of the Grampians National Park.

In the 2024-2025 summer, 2 bushfires burnt an estimated 136,329 hectares of the park and surrounding private land.

<doc id="63239" wikidata="Q213048" url="?curid=63239" title="Times New Roman">
<text>Times New Roman is a serif typeface commissioned for use by the British newspaper &quot;The Times&quot; in 1931. It has become one of the most popular typefaces of all time and is installed on most personal computers. The typeface was conceived by Stanley Morison, the artistic adviser to the British branch of the printing equipment company Monotype, in collaboration with Victor Lardent, a lettering artist in &quot;The Times&#x27;s&quot; advertising department.

Asked to advise on a redesign, Morison recommended that &quot;The Times&quot; change their body text typeface from a spindly nineteenth-century face to a more robust, solid design, returning to traditions of printing from the eighteenth century and before. This matched a common trend in printing tastes of the period. Morison proposed an older Monotype typeface named Plantin as a basis for the design, and Times New Roman mostly matches Plantin&#x27;s dimensions. The main change was that the contrast between strokes was enhanced to give a crisper image. The new design made its debut in &quot;The Times&quot; on 3 October 1932. After one year, the design was released for commercial sale. In Times New Roman&#x27;s name, Roman is a reference to the regular or roman style (sometimes also called Antiqua), the first part of the Times New Roman typeface family to be designed. Roman type has roots in Italian printing of the late 15th and early 16th centuries, but Times New Roman&#x27;s design has no connection to Rome or to the Romans.

&quot;The Times&quot; stayed with the original Times New Roman for 40 years. The paper subsequently has switched typefaces five times between 1972 and 2007 to different variants of the original due to new production techniques and a format change from broadsheet to tabloid in 2004.

==Design==

Times New Roman has a robust colour on the page and influences of European early modern and Baroque printing. As a typeface designed for newspaper printing, Times New Roman has a high x-height, short descenders to allow tight linespacing and a relatively condensed appearance. (Although Hutt, and most other authors, describe Times New Roman as having a higher x-height than Plantin, Tracy reports based on published Monotype dimensions that in the original small metal-type sizes the difference was not great.)
The roman style of Plantin was loosely based on a metal type created in the late sixteenth century by the French artisan Robert Granjon and preserved in the collection of the Plantin-Moretus Museum of Antwerp. This style is sometimes categorised as part of the &quot;old-style&quot; of serif fonts (from before the eighteenth century). (The &#x27;a&#x27; of Plantin was not based on Granjon&#x27;s work: the Plantin-Moretus Museum&#x27;s type had a substitute &#x27;a&#x27; cut later.) Indeed, the working title of Times New Roman was &quot;Times Old Style&quot;.

However, Times New Roman modifies the Granjon influence further than Plantin due to features such as its &#x27;a&#x27; and &#x27;e&#x27;, with very large counters and apertures, its ball terminal detailing, a straight-sided &#x27;M&#x27; and an increased level of contrast between thick and thin strokes, so it has often been compared to fonts from the late eighteenth century, the so-called &#x27;transitional&#x27; genre, in particular the Baskerville typeface of the 1750s. Historian and sometime Monotype executive Allan Haley commented that compared to Plantin &quot;serifs had been sharpened...contrast was increased and character curves were refined,&quot; while Lawson described Times&#x27;s higher-contrast crispness as having &quot;a sparkle [Plantin] never achieved&quot;.

===Italic and bold===

Morison described the companion italic as also being influenced by the typefaces created by the Didot family in the late 18th and early 19th centuries: a &quot;rationalistic italic that owed nothing to the tradition of the sixteenth or seventeenth centuries. It has, indeed, more in common with the eighteenth century.&quot; Morison had several years earlier attracted attention for promoting the radical idea that italics in book printing were too disruptive to the flow of text, and should be phased out. He rapidly came to concede that the idea was impractical, and later wryly commented to historian Harry Carter that &#x27;Times italic&#x27; &quot;owes more to Didot than dogma.&quot; Morison wrote in a personal letter of Times New Roman&#x27;s mixed heritage that it &quot;has the merit of not looking as if it had been designed by somebody in particular.&quot;

Rather than creating a companion boldface with letterforms similar to the roman style, Times New Roman&#x27;s bold has a different character, with a more condensed and more upright effect caused by making the horizontal parts of curves consistently the thinnest lines of each letter, and making the top serifs of letters like &#x27;d&#x27; purely horizontal. This effect is not found in sixteenth-century typefaces (which, in any case, did not have bold versions); it is most associated with the Didone, or &quot;modern&quot; type of the early nineteenth century (and with the more recent &#x27;Ionic&#x27; styles of type influenced by it that were offered by Linotype, discussed below).&lt;ref name=&quot;Three chapters in the development of Clarendon/Ionic typefaces&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators have found &#x27;Times bold&#x27; unsatisfactory and too condensed, such as Walter Tracy.

===Historical background===

During the nineteenth century, the standard roman types for general-purpose printing were &quot;Modern&quot; or Didone designs, and these were standard in all newspaper printing. Designs in the nineteenth-century style remain a common part of the aesthetic of newspaper printing; for example in 2017 digital typeface designer Tobias Frere-Jones wrote that he kept his Exchange family, designed for the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, based on the nineteenth-century model as it &quot;had to feel like the news.&quot; According to Mosley and Williamson the modern-face used by &quot;The Times&quot; was Monotype&#x27;s Series 7 or &quot;Modern Extended&quot;, based on typefaces by Miller and Richard.
By the 1920s, some in the publishing industry felt that the modern-face model was too spindly and high-contrast for optimal legibility at the small sizes and punishing printing techniques of newspaper printing. In 1925, the Mergenthaler Linotype Company, Monotype&#x27;s main competitor, launched a new newspaper typeface called Ionic, which became the first in a series known as the Legibility Group. These kept to the nineteenth-century model but greatly reduced the contrast of the letterform. The thinnest strokes of the letter were made thicker and strokes were kept as far apart as possible to maximise legibility. It proved extremely successful: Allen Hutt, Monotype&#x27;s newspaper printing consultant in the late 1930s, later noted that it &quot;revolutionised newspaper text setting...within eighteen months it was adopted by 3,000 papers.&quot; Although Times New Roman does not in any way resemble it, Walter Tracy, a prominent type designer who worked on a redesign of Times in the 1970s and wrote an analysis of its design in his book &quot;Letters of Credit&quot; (1986), commented that its arrival must at least have influenced the decision to consider a redesign.

The development of Times New Roman was relatively involved due to the lack of a specific pre-existing model – or perhaps a surfeit of possible choices. Morison wrote in a memo that he hoped for a design that would have relatively sharp serifs, matching the general design of the Times&#x27; previous font, but on a darker and more traditional basic structure. Bulked-up versions of Monotype&#x27;s pre-existing but rather dainty Baskerville and Perpetua typefaces were considered for a basis, and the Legibility Group designs were also examined. (Perpetua, which Monotype had recently commissioned from sculptor Eric Gill at Morison&#x27;s urging, is considered a &#x27;transitional&#x27; design in aesthetic, although it does not revive any specific model.) Walter Tracy, who knew Lardent, suggested in the 1980s that &quot;Morison did not begin with a clear vision of the ultimate type, but felt his way along.&quot;
Morison&#x27;s biographer Nicolas Barker has written that Morison&#x27;s memos of the time wavered over a variety of options before it was ultimately concluded that Plantin formed the best basis for a condensed font that could nonetheless be made to fill out the full size of the letter space as far as possible. (Morison ultimately conceded that Perpetua, which had been his pet project, was &#x27;too basically circular&#x27; to be practical to condense in an attractive way.)

Walter Tracy and James Moran, who discussed the design&#x27;s creation with Lardent in the 1960s, found that Lardent himself had little memory of exactly what material Morison gave him as a specimen to use to design the typeface, but he told Moran that he remembered working on the design from archive photographs of vintage type; he thought this was a book printed by Christophe Plantin, the sixteenth-century printer whose printing office the Plantin-Moretus Museum preserves and is named for. Moran and Tracy suggested that this actually might have been the same specimen of type from the Plantin-Moretus Museum that Plantin had been based on, and Barker notes that this is likely to be correct, as although Plantin is based on a Granjon type in the collection of the museum, that specific type was only acquired by Plantin&#x27;s heirs after his death, and Times and Plantin both copy an &#x27;a&#x27; not added to the type after Plantin&#x27;s death. The sharpened serifs somewhat recall Perpetua, although Morison&#x27;s stated reason for them was to provide continuity with the previous Didone design and the crispness associated with the &quot;Times&quot;&#x27; printing; he also cited as a reason that sharper serifs looked better after stereotyping or printed on a rotary press. Although Morison may not have literally drawn the design, his influence on its concept was sufficient that he felt he could call it &quot;my one effort at designing a font&quot; in a letter to Daniel Berkeley Updike, a prominent American printing historian with whom he corresponded frequently. Morison&#x27;s several accounts of his reasoning in designing the concept of Times New Roman were somewhat contradictory and historians of printing have suggested that in practice they were mostly composed to rationalise his pre-existing aesthetic preferences: after Morison&#x27;s death Allen Hutt went so far as to describe his unsigned 1936 article on the topic as &quot;rather odd...it can only be regarded as a piece of Morisonian mystification&quot;.

Lardent&#x27;s original drawings are according to Rhatigan lost, but photographs exist of his drawings. Rhatigan comments that Lardent&#x27;s originals show &quot;the spirit of the final type, but not the details.&quot; The design was adapted from Lardent&#x27;s large drawings by the Monotype drawing office team in Salfords, Surrey, which worked out spacing and simplified some fine details. Further changes were made after manufacturing began (the latter a difficult practice, since new punches and matrices had to be machined after each design change).

Morison continued to develop a close connection with the &quot;Times&quot; that would last throughout his life. Morison edited the History of the Times from 1935 to 1952, and in the post-war period, at a time when Monotype effectively stopped developing new typefaces due to pressures of austerity, took a post as editor of the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; which he held from 1945 to 1948. Times New Roman remained Morison&#x27;s only type design; he designed a type to be issued by the Bauer Type Foundry of Frankfurt but the project was abandoned due to the war. Morison told his friend Ellic Howe that the test type sent to him just before the war was sent to the government to be &quot;analysed in order that we should know whether the Hun is hard up for lead or antimony or tin.&quot; Brooke Crutchley, Printer to Cambridge University, recorded in his diary a more informal discussion of the design&#x27;s origins from a conversation in August 1948:SM thought that Dreyfus might in time be able to design a mathematical font but he would first have to get out of his system a lot of personal ideas and searching for effects. He, Morison, had to do all this before he could design the Times font. Will Carter came in to consult M about a new type for the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, on which he had been invited to experiment. M said that the answer was really Times and that if he worked out the problem from the bottom that was the sort of answer he would get...Will has been experimenting with Plantin, but it doesn&#x27;t come out well when printed from plates on rotaries, perhaps a face based on Plantin would do the trick. M said that was just how he got to Times.

==Metal type versions==
A large number of variants of Times were cut during the metal type period, in particular headline weights and families of titling capitals for headlines. Walter Tracy in &quot;Letters of Credit&quot;, Allen Hutt and others have discussed these extensively in their works on the family. (Morison felt in 1953 that the most important part of &quot;The Times&quot;&#x27;s redesign that introduced Times New Roman was not the body text at all, but introducing headline fonts that matched the text type.)

===Titling===
Monotype created some caps-only titling designs to match Times New Roman itself. These are not sold by Monotype in digital format, although Linotype&#x27;s Times Eighteen in the same style (see below) is.

===Times Hever Titling===

An elegant titling caps design, quite different from Times New Roman with a Caslon-style A (with a serif at top left of the letter, suggesting a stroke written with a quill) and old-style C and W; Tracy suggests Monotype&#x27;s previous Poliphilus design as an influence. Named after Hever Castle, the home of the &quot;Times&quot;&#x27; owner Lord Astor and designed early on, it was used by the &quot;Times&quot; for headings in the lighter sections such as society pages, arts and fashion. It has not been digitised.

===Times Wide (1938, series 427)===
A variant intended for book printing, avoiding the slight condensation of the original Times New Roman. Although it was popular in the metal type period for book printing, it was apparently never digitised. Monotype also created a version, series 627, with long descenders more appropriate to classic book typography. Optional text figures were also available.

===Series 727 and 827===
Monotype also produced Series 727, in which the heavier strokes of upper-case letters were made slightly thinner. This was done to produce a lighter effect in which capital letters do not stand out so much, and was particularly intended for German use, since in the German language capitals are far more common since they appear at the start of each noun. Series 827 modified some letters (notably the &quot;R&quot;) to correspond to their appearance in other typefaces popular in French printing. This production of what are now called stylistic alternates to suit national tastes was common at the time, and many alternates were also offered for Gill Sans for use in Europe.

===Claritas (1951)===
A modified 4 point size of Times Roman was produced by Monotype for use in printing matter requiring a very small size of type. Listed as Times Newspaper Smalls, available as either Series 333 or 335, it was also referred to by the name Claritas.

===Times 4-line Mathematics Series 569===
This is a variant designed for printing mathematical formulae, using the 4‑line system for mathematics developed by Monotype in 1957. This modified version of Times Roman was designed for use as part of Monotype&#x27;s 4-line Mathematics system. The major changes to the Times Roman typeface itself were a reduction in the slope of italic characters to 12 degrees from 16 degrees, so as to reduce the need for kerning, and a change in the form of italic &#x27;v&#x27; and &#x27;w&#x27; so that italic &#x27;v&#x27; could be more easily distinguished from a Greek nu.

The 4-line system involved casting characters for 10-point Times Roman on 6-point bodies. The top of the character would overhang the slug, forming a kern which was less fragile than the normal kerns of foundry type, as it was on a slab of cast metal. This technique had been in previous use on Monotype machines, usually involving double-height matrices, to allow the automatic setting of &quot;advertising figures&quot; (numbers that occupy two or more lines, usually to clearly indicate a price in an advertisement set in small type). This meant that the same matrix could be used for both superscript and subscript numbers. More importantly, it allowed a variable or other item to have both a superscript and a subscript at the same time, one above the other, without inordinate difficulty.

Previously, while the Monotype system, due to its flexibility, was widely used for setting mathematical formulas, Monotype&#x27;s Modern Series 7 was usually used for this purpose. Because of the popularity of Times Roman at the time, Monotype chose to design a variant of Times Roman suited to mathematical composition, and recut many additional characters needed for mathematics, including special symbols as well as Greek and Fraktur alphabets, to accompany the system instead of designing it around the typeface that was being used, for which characters were already available. Matrices for some 700 characters were available as part of Times Roman Series 569 when it was released in 1958, with new characters constantly being added for over a decade afterwards (thus, in 1971, 8,000 characters were included, and new ones were being added at a rate of about 5 per week).

=== Others ===
&quot;The Times&quot; also used a sans-serif wood type for printing newbills which had no connection to Times New Roman. It was similar to Kabel Bold Condensed.

Besides Monotype versions, Times New Roman was also available in metal type from Linotype, discussed below, and Intertype.
==Usage==

Times New Roman&#x27;s popularity rapidly expanded beyond its original niche, becoming popular in book printing and general publishing. Monotype promoted the typeface in their trade magazine, &quot;The Monotype Recorder&quot;, and took advantage of this popularity by cutting a widened version, Series 427, for book publishing, although many books ultimately used the original version. The first known book published in Times New Roman (the original 327 Monotype series) was &quot;Minnow Among Tritons&quot;, published by the Nonesuch Press and printed by R&amp;R Clark in 1934. (Because the cover of the &quot;Monotype Recorder&quot; compared the new &quot;Times New Roman&quot; with a sample of the previous type labelled as &quot;Times Old Roman&quot;, some writers have assumed that the Times&#x27; previous typeface was actually called this, which it was not.)

An early user of Times New Roman outside its origin was by Daniel Berkeley Updike, an influential historian of printing with whom Morison carried an extensive correspondence. Impressed by the design, he used it to set his book &quot;Some Aspects of Printing, Old and New&quot;. It then was chosen by the Crowell-Collier magazines &quot;Woman&#x27;s Home Companion&quot; and then its sister publications such as &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot;. A brochure was published to mark the change along with a letter from Morison hoping that the redesign would be a success. Ultimately it became Monotype&#x27;s best-selling metal type of all time.

Walter Tracy, who worked on a redesign, however noted that the design&#x27;s compression and fine detail extending to the edge of the matrices was not ideal in the aggressive conditions of most newspaper printing, in which the &quot;Times&quot; was unusual for its particularly high standard of printing suiting its luxury market. Users found that in the hot metal period it was common for the molten metal to rapidly eat through the matrices as type was being cast, and so it did not become popular among other newspapers: &quot;Times Roman achieved its popularity chiefly in general printing, not in newspaper work.&quot; He described it as particularly used in &quot;book work, especially non-fiction&quot; such as the &quot;Encyclopaedia Britannica&quot;. Hutt also commented that Times New Roman&#x27;s relative condensation was less useful than might be expected for newspaper printing, since in a normal newspaper column frequent paragraph breaks tend to provide area that can absorb the space of wider letters without increasing the number of lines used–but &quot;The Times&quot;, whose house style in the 1930s was to minimise the number of paragraph breaks, was an exception to this.

A number of early reviews of Times New Roman were published in Morison&#x27;s lifetime that discussed aspects of its design. Most were appreciative (Morison was an influential figure in publishing) but several noted that it did not follow conventional expectations of newspaper typeface design. One article that discussed its design was &quot;Optical Scale in Typefounding&quot;, written by Harry Carter and published in 1937, which discussed the differences between small and large-size typeface designs. He commented &quot;The small sizes of Plantin embody what are supposed to be the requirements of a good small type [but] Times Roman, which most people find the easiest to read of small text-types, runs counter to some of them...[Morison] avoided blunt serifs and thickened hairlines because he found they wore down more noticeably than sharper-cut features.&quot;

Times New Roman remains popular in publishing, helped by the extremely large range of characters available for international and mathematics printing. For example, the American Psychological Association suggests using Times New Roman in papers written in its APA style.

The U.S. Department of State used Times New Roman as the standard font in its official documents from 2004 to 2023, before switching to Calibri.

The Australian Government logo used Times New Roman Bold as a wordmark for departments and agencies are required to use common branding on their websites and print publications.

==Linotype design (Times Roman)==
Monotype originally created Times New Roman for its typesetting machines, but its rival Linotype rapidly began to offer its version of the typeface with subtle differences. A key reason is that many newspapers, including &quot;The Times&quot;, also used Linotype equipment for production. Linotype referred to its design as &quot;Times&quot; or &quot;Times Roman&quot;. Monotype and Linotype have since merged, but the lineage of Times has been split into two subtly different designs since its earliest days.

Although Times New Roman and Times are very similar, various differences developed between the versions marketed by Linotype and Monotype when the master fonts were transferred from metal to photo and digital media. For example, Linotype has slanted serifs on the capital S, while Monotype&#x27;s are vertical, and Linotype has an extra serif on the number 5. Most of these differences are invisible in body text at normal reading distances, or 10pts at 300 dpi. Subtle competition grew between the two foundries, as the proportions and details as well as the width metrics for their version of Times grew apart. Differences between the two versions do occur in the lowercase z in the italic weight (Times Linotype has a curl also followed in the STIX revival, Times New Roman is straight), and in the percent sign in all weights (Linotype and STIX have a stroke connecting up the left-hand zero with a slash, Times New Roman does not). Monotype&#x27;s &#x27;J&#x27; is non-descending, but Linotype&#x27;s in the bold weight descends below the baseline. Linotype&#x27;s metal version of Times had a shrunken &#x27;f&#x27; due to a technical limitation of the Linotype system—it could not cast a kerning &#x27;f&#x27;, one that extended into the space of surrounding letters. This restriction was removed in the digital version.

Linotype licensed its version to Xerox and then Adobe and Apple, guaranteeing its importance in digital printing by making it one of the core fonts of the PostScript page description language. Microsoft&#x27;s version of Times New Roman is licensed from Monotype, hence the original name. For compatibility, Monotype had to subtly redraw their design to match the widths from the Adobe/Linotype version. Versions of Times New Roman from Monotype (discussed below) exist which vary from the PostScript metrics. Linotype applied for registration of the trademark name &quot;Times Roman&quot; and received registration status in 1945.

==Modern releases==

===Monotype variants===

Monotype has released at least eight digital typefaces under the name Times New Roman.

====Times New Roman====
Since Windows 3.1, all versions of Microsoft Windows include Times New Roman. Version 6.87 of this typeface is available for purchase under the name Times New Roman OS (see below). The current 7.03 version of Windows&#x27; Times New Roman includes small capitals, text figures, and italic swash capitals. It omits automatic ligature insertion, but enabling the &quot;discretionary ligatures&quot; feature will provide ligatures for &quot;fi&quot; and &quot;Th&quot;. More complex Unicode ligatures like &quot;ffi&quot; and &quot;ft&quot; are also available. A previous version of Times New Roman was also distributed as part of Microsoft&#x27;s Core Fonts for the Web package.

When the system font Times New Roman was expanded to support Arabic script, it was complemented with the Arabic character set from Simplified Arabic, a typeface that Compugraphic Corporation had plagiarized from Linotype and leased to Microsoft. Times New Roman with support for Arabic was first published in the Arabic version of Windows 3.1x.

====Times New Roman OS====
Also known as Times New Roman World, this is originally based on the version of Times New Roman bundled with Windows Vista. It includes fonts in WGL character sets, Hebrew and Arabic characters. Similar to Helvetica World, Arabic in italic fonts are in roman positions.

====Others====
Monotype further sells a wider range of styles and optical sizes in order to meet the needs of newspapers and books which print at a range of text sizes.
*Times New Roman Pro and Times New Roman Std are the basic releases, which include Regular, Medium, Semi Bold, and Bold weights with matching italics, along with Extra Bold and Condensed (in regular, italic and bold). Times New Roman Pro and Std provide standard ligature for &quot;fi&quot;.
*Times New Roman Seven is for smaller text and includes Regular and Bold with their italics.
*Times New Roman Small Text includes Regular, Italic, and Bold.

===Linotype variants===
====Times====

This is the digitalisation of Linotype&#x27;s Times (see above). It is pre-installed on macOS but not on iOS, and is also widely available for purchase. Times provides standard ligature for &quot;fi&quot;, but it does not provide any ligature for &quot;Th&quot;.

====Others====

Like Monotype, Linotype released additional versions of Times for different text sizes. These include:
*Times Ten is a version specially designed for smaller text (12-point and below). It features wider characters and stronger hairlines. In 2004 prominent typeface designer Erik Spiekermann said that he believed that it was the best Times New Roman digitisation then available.
*Times Eighteen, a headline version for point sizes of 18 and larger. The characters are subtly condensed and the hairlines are finer. The current version has no italics, but does have a lower case (whereas some Times titling fonts were capitals only).
*Times Europa Office, a 2006 adaptation of &quot;The Times&#x27;s&quot; 1972 design Times Europa (see below). This is a complete family of designs intended for use on poor-quality paper. The updating, created by Akira Kobayashi, contains tabular numbers, mathematical signs, and currency symbols. Each character has the same advance width in all the fonts in the family so that changing from regular to bold or italic does not affect word wrap.
==Later typefaces used by &quot;The Times&quot;==

&quot;The Times&quot; newspaper has commissioned various successors to Times New Roman:
*Times Europa was designed by Walter Tracy in 1972 for &quot;The Times&quot;, as a sturdier alternative to the Times font family, designed for the demands of faster printing presses and cheaper paper. It has been released commercially by Adobe, among others, recently in an updating by Linotype as Times Europa Office (discussed above).
*Times Roman replaced Times Europa on 30 August 1982.
*Times Millennium was made in 1991, drawn by Gunnlaugur Briem on the instructions of Aurobind Patel, composing manager of News International.
*Times Classic first appeared in 2001. Designed as an economical face by Dave Farey and Richard Dawson, it took advantage of the new PC-based publishing system at the newspaper; the new typeface included 120 letters per font.
*Times Modern was unveiled on 20 November 2006, as the successor of Times Classic. Designed for improving legibility in smaller font sizes, it uses 45-degree angled bracket serifs. It was designed by Research Studios, led by designer Neville Brody with input from Ben Preston, deputy editor of &quot;The Times&quot;. (Other designs have been released called Times Modern; see below.) During the Times New Roman period &quot;The Times&quot; also sometimes used Perpetua Titling.

==William Starling Burgess==
In 1994 the printing historian Mike Parker published claims that the design of Times New Roman&#x27;s roman or regular style was based on a 1904 design of William Starling Burgess. This theory remains controversial. Parker and his friend Gerald Giampa, a Canadian printer who had bought up the defunct American branch of Lanston Monotype, claimed that, in 1904, Burgess created a type design for company documents at his shipyard in Marblehead, Massachusetts, and hired Lanston Monotype to issue it. However, Burgess abandoned the idea and Monotype shelved the sketches, ultimately reusing them as a basis for Times New Roman. Giampa claimed that he stumbled upon original material in 1987, after he had purchased Lanston Monotype, and that some of the papers that had been his evidence had been lost in a flood at his house, while Parker claimed that an additional source was material in a section of the Smithsonian now closed due to asbestos contamination. Giampa asked Parker to complete the type from the limited number of surviving letters, which was issued in June 2009 by Font Bureau under the name of &#x27;Starling&#x27;.
Reception to the claims was sceptical, with dismissal from Morison&#x27;s biographer Nicolas Barker and Luc Devroye among others; Barker suggested that the material had been fabricated in order to aid Giampa in embarrassing Monotype&#x27;s British branch, while Devroye and Thomas Phinney of FontLab suggested that the claim had begun as a prank. In 2010, Mark Owens described Parker&#x27;s article in retrospect as &quot;the scantest of evidence&quot; and a &quot;fog of irrelevant details&quot; and Simon Loxley that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t really have a leg to stand on&quot;. Monotype executive Dan Rhatigan described the theory as implausible in 2011: &quot;I&#x27;ll admit that I tend to side with the more fully documented (both in general, and in agreement with what little I can find within Monotype to support it) notion that Times New Roman was based on Plantin...I won&#x27;t rule out the possibility that Starling Burgess drew up the concept first, but Occam&#x27;s razor makes me doubt it.&quot;

The Times Online web site credits the design to &quot;Stanley Morrison, Victor Lardent and perhaps Starling Burgess&quot;.
==Designs inspired by Times New Roman==
In the phototypesetting and digital typesetting periods many font designs have been published inspired by Times New Roman. Although the digital data of Monotype and Linotype releases of Times New Roman are copyrighted, and the name &quot;Times&quot; is trademarked, the design itself is in many countries not copyrightable. Notably, the United States allows alternative interpretations if they do not reuse digital data.
*Times Modern was a condensed and bold display variant published by, among others, Elsner+Flake. It was withdrawn from sale due to trademark disputes with the &quot;Times&quot; newspaper, which owns its own unrelated design named &#x27;Times Modern&#x27; (see above).
*CG Times is a variant of Times family made by Compugraphic.
*Pelham is a version of Times Roman by DTP Types of Britain, which also designed an infant version with single-storey &#x27;a&#x27; and &#x27;g&#x27;.

* In the mid-1960s, a derivative of Times New Roman known as &#x27;Press Roman&#x27; was used as a font for the IBM Composer. This was an ultra-premium electric &#x27;golfball&#x27; typewriter system, intended to be used for producing high-quality office documents or copy to be photographically enlarged for small-scale printing projects. Unlike most typewriters, the Composer produced proportional type, rather than monospaced letters. Ultimately the system proved a niche product, as it competed with increasingly cheap phototypesetting, and then in the 1980s was largely displaced by word processors and general-purpose computers.
* Among many digital-period designs loosely inspired by Times, Kris Sowersby&#x27;s popular Tiempos family is a loose Times New Roman revival; it was created for a Spanish newspaper (&#x27;tiempo&#x27; is Spanish for &#x27;time&#x27;).
* Maxitype designed the Rhymes typeface, which also inspired from the Times New Roman typeface, comprises Display and Text.
* In 2018, art collective MSCHF released a typeface titled Times Newer Roman, which has the same design as Times New Roman but is 10–15% wider.

==Free alternatives==

There are some free software fonts used as alternatives, including metric-compatible designs used for font substitution.
*URW++ produced a version of Times New Roman called Nimbus Roman in 1982. Nimbus Roman No9 L, URW&#x27;s PostScript variant, was released under the GNU General Public License in 1996, and is included with some free and open source software. Various adapted versions exist including FreeSerif, TeX Gyre Termes and TeX Gyre Termes Math. Like Times New Roman, many additional styles of Nimbus Roman exist that are only sold commercially, including condensed and extra-bold styles. URW also developed Nimbus Roman No. 4, which is metrically compatible with the slightly different CG Times.
*Linux Libertine was developed in 2003 and released under the GNU General Public License and the SIL Open Font License. In 2010, it was adopted for the redesign of the Wikipedia logo. 
*The Libertinus family of fonts was forked from Linux Libertine in 2012 and continues to be maintained and developed (2024).

* The STIX Fonts project is a four-style set of open-source fonts. They were created for scientific publishing by the Scientific and Technical Information Exchange consortium of publishers, but are also very suitable for general use, including Greek and Cyrillic support. The original version is installed by default on Mac OS X, and adapted as XITS. In 2016, a completely redesigned version was released by Ross Mills and John Hudson of Tiro Typeworks. Unlike the previous version, it is an original design, with a higher x-height than Monotype&#x27;s Times digitisation. 
*Liberation Serif by Steve Matteson is metrically equivalent to Times New Roman. It was developed by Ascender Corp. and published by Red Hat in 2007 under the GPL with the font exception. Widths aside, it does not particularly resemble Times New Roman, being much squarer in shape with less fine detail and blunt ends rather than ball terminals. Google&#x27;s Tinos in the Croscore fonts package is a derivative of Liberation Serif.
===Non-Latin fonts using Times New Roman&#x27;s Latin-alphabet glyphs ===
Some fonts intended for typesetting multiple writing systems use Times New Roman as a model for Latin-alphabet glyphs:
* Bitstream Cyberbit is a roman-only font released by Bitstream with an expanded character range intended to cover a large proportion of Unicode for scholarly use, with European alphabets based on Times New Roman. Bitstream no longer offers the font, but it remains downloadable from the University of Frankfurt.
* Doulos SIL is a serif typeface developed by SIL International.
* The Russian Astra Linux operating system includes PT Astra Serif, a derivative of PT Serif metrically compatible with Times New Roman.
* Jomolhari is a Tibetan script Uchen font created by Christopher J. Fynn, freely available under the Open Font License. It supports text encoded using the Unicode Standard and the Chinese national standard for encoding characters of the Tibetan script (GB/T20524-2006 &quot;Tibetan Coded Character Set&quot;). The design of the font is based on Bhutanese manuscript examples and it is suitable for text in Tibetan, Dzongkha and other languages written in the Tibetan script.
* Two typefaces in the National Fonts project (specifically Kinnari and Norasi) based their Latin character glyphs from Times New Roman. Typefaces in the National Fonts project were intended to be public alternatives to the widely used, yet licence-restricted, commercial typefaces that came bundled with major operating systems and applications. Later on, Thai Linux Working Group (TLWG) released these 2 typefaces alongside 11 others as free and open-source software.

<text>Chemical symbols are the abbreviations used in chemistry, mainly for chemical elements; but also for functional groups, chemical compounds, and other entities. Element symbols for chemical elements, also known as atomic symbols, normally consist of one or two letters from the Latin alphabet and are written with the first letter capitalised.

==History==
Earlier symbols for chemical elements stem from classical Latin and Greek vocabulary. For some elements, this is because the material was known in ancient times, while for others, the name is a more recent invention. For example, Pb is the symbol for lead (&quot;plumbum&quot; in Latin); Hg is the symbol for mercury (&quot;hydrargyrum&quot; in Greek); and He is the symbol for helium (a Neo-Latin name) because helium was not known in ancient Roman times. Some symbols come from other sources, like W for tungsten (&quot;Wolfram&quot; in German) which was not known in Roman times.

A three-letter temporary symbol may be assigned to a newly synthesized (or not yet synthesized) element. For example, &quot;Uno&quot; was the temporary symbol for hassium (element 108) which had the temporary name of &quot;unniloctium&quot;, based on the digits of its atomic number. There are also some historical symbols that are no longer officially used.

==Extension of the symbol==

In addition to the letters for the element itself, additional details may be added to the symbol as superscripts or subscripts a particular isotope, ionization, or oxidation state, or other atomic detail. A few isotopes have their own specific symbols rather than just an isotopic detail added to their element symbol.

Attached subscripts or superscripts specifying a nuclide or molecule have the following meanings and positions:

*The nucleon number (mass number) is shown in the left superscript position (e.g., 14N). This number defines the specific isotope. Various letters, such as &quot;m&quot; and &quot;f&quot; may also be used here to indicate a nuclear isomer (e.g., 99mTc). Alternately, the number here can represent a specific spin state (e.g., 1O2). These details can be omitted if not relevant in a certain context.
*The proton number (atomic number) may be indicated in the left subscript position (e.g., 64Gd). The atomic number is redundant to the chemical element, but is sometimes used to emphasize the change of numbers of nucleons in a nuclear reaction.
*If necessary, a state of ionization or an excited state may be indicated in the right superscript position (e.g., state of ionization Ca2+).
*The number of atoms of an element in a molecule or chemical compound is shown in the right subscript position (e.g., N2 or Fe2O3). If this number is one, it is normally omitted - the number one is implicitly understood if unspecified.
*A radical is indicated by a dot on the right side (e.g., Cl• for a neutral chlorine atom). This is often omitted unless relevant to a certain context because it is already deducible from the charge and atomic number, as generally true for nonbonded valence electrons in skeletal structures.

Many functional groups also have their own chemical symbol, e.g. Ph for the phenyl group, and Me for the methyl group.

A list of current, dated, as well as proposed and historical signs and symbols is included here with its signification. Also given is each element&#x27;s atomic number, atomic weight, or the atomic mass of the most stable isotope, group and period numbers on the periodic table, and etymology of the symbol.

==Symbols for chemical elements==
==Symbols and names not currently used==

The following is a list of symbols and names formerly used or suggested for elements, including symbols for placeholder names and names given by discredited claimants for discovery.
===Systematic chemical symbols===

These symbols are based on systematic element names, which are now replaced by trivial (non-systematic) element names and symbols. Data is given in order of: atomic number, systematic symbol, systematic name; trivial symbol, trivial name.
* 101: Unu, unnilunium; Md, mendelevium.
* 102: Unb, unnilbium; No, nobelium.
* 103: Unt, unniltrium; Lr, lawrencium.
* 104: Unq, unnilquadium; Rf, rutherfordium.
* 105: Unp, unnilpentium; Db, dubnium.
* 106: Unh, unnilhexium; Sg, seaborgium.
* 107: Uns, unnilseptium; Bh, bohrium.
* 108: Uno, unniloctium; Hs, hassium.
* 109: Une, unnilennium; Mt, meitnerium.
* 110: Uun, ununnilium; Ds, darmstadtium.
* 111: Uuu, unununium; Rg, roentgenium.
* 112: Uub, ununbium; Cn, copernicium.
* 113: Uut, ununtrium; Nh, nihonium.
* 114: Uuq, ununquadium; Fl, flerovium.
* 115: Uup, ununpentium; Mc, moscovium.
* 116: Uuh, ununhexium; Lv, livermorium.
* 117: Uus, ununseptium; Ts, tennessine.
* 118: Uuo, ununoctium; Og, oganesson.

When elements beyond oganesson (starting with ununennium, Uue, element 119), are discovered; their systematic name and symbol will presumably be superseded by a trivial name and symbol.

===Alchemical symbols===

The following ideographic symbols were used in alchemy to denote elements known since ancient times. Not included in this list are spurious elements, such as the classical elements fire and water or phlogiston, and substances now known to be compounds. Many more symbols were in at least sporadic use: one early 17th-century alchemical manuscript lists 22 symbols for mercury alone.

Planetary names and symbols for the metals – the seven planets and seven metals known since Classical times in Europe and the Mideast – was ubiquitous in alchemy. The association of what are anachronistically known as planetary metals started breaking down with the discovery of antimony, bismuth and zinc in the 16th century. Alchemists would typically call the metals by their planetary names, e.g. &quot;Saturn&quot; for lead and &quot;Mars&quot; for iron; compounds of tin, iron and silver continued to be called &quot;jovial&quot;, &quot;martial&quot; and &quot;lunar&quot;; or &quot;of Jupiter&quot;, &quot;of Mars&quot; and &quot;of the moon&quot;, through the 17th century. The tradition remains today with the name of the element mercury, where chemists decided the planetary name was preferable to common names like &quot;quicksilver&quot;, and in a few archaic terms such as (silver nitrate) and saturnism (lead poisoning).

===Daltonian symbols===

The following symbols were employed by John Dalton in the early 1800s as the periodic table of elements was being formulated. Not included in this list are substances now known to be compounds, such as certain rare-earth mineral blends. Modern alphabetic notation was introduced in 1814 by Jöns Jakob Berzelius; its precursor can be seen in Dalton&#x27;s circled letters for the metals, especially in his augmented table from 1810.
A trace of Dalton&#x27;s conventions also survives in ball-and-stick models of molecules, where balls for carbon are black and for oxygen red.

==Symbols for named isotopes==
The following is a list of isotopes which have been given unique symbols. This is not a list of current systematic symbols (in the Atom form); such a list can instead be found in . The symbols for isotopes of hydrogen, deuterium (D) and tritium (T), are still in use today, as is thoron (Tn) for radon-220 (though not actinon; An usually instead means a generic actinide). Heavy water and other deuterated solvents are commonly used in chemistry, and it is convenient to use a single character rather than a symbol with a subscript in these cases. The practice also continues with tritium compounds. When the name of the solvent is given, a lowercase d is sometimes used. For example, d-benzene or CD can be used instead of C[H].

The symbols for isotopes of elements other than hydrogen and radon are no longer used in the scientific community. Many of these symbols were designated during the early years of radiochemistry, and several isotopes (namely those in the decay chains of actinium, radium, and thorium) bear placeholder names using the early naming system devised by Ernest Rutherford.
==Other symbols==

* In Chinese, each chemical element has a dedicated character, usually created for the purpose (see Chemical elements in East Asian languages). However, in Chinese Latin symbols are also used, especially in formulas.

<text>In typography, the pilcrow (¶) is a glyph used to identify a paragraph. In editorial production the &quot;pilcrow&quot; typographic character may also be known as the paragraph mark, the paragraph sign, the paragraph symbol, the paraph, and the blind P.

In writing and editorial practice, authors and editors use the pilcrow glyph to indicate the start of separate paragraphs, and to identify a new paragraph within a long block of text without paragraph indentions, as in the book &quot;An Essay on Typography&quot; (1931), by Eric Gill. In the Middle Ages, the practice of rubrication (type in red-ink) used a red pilcrow to indicate the beginning of a different train of thought within the author&#x27;s narrative without paragraphs.

The typographic character of the pilcrow usually is drawn like a lowercase letter-, reaching from the descender to the ascender height; the bowl (loop) can be filled or empty. Moreover, the pilcrow can also be drawn with the bowl extended downward, to resemble a reversed letter-.

== Origin and name ==
The English word &quot;pilcrow&quot; derives from the &amp;lsqb;&amp;rsqb;, &quot;written in the side&quot; or &quot;written in the margin&quot;. In Old French, &quot;parágraphos&quot; became the word and later . The earliest English language reference to the modern pilcrow is in 1440, with the Middle English word .

=== Use in Ancient Greek ===


The first way to divide sentences into groups in Ancient Greek was the original [], which was a horizontal line in the margin to the left of the main text. As the became more popular, the horizontal line eventually changed into the Greek letter Gamma (, ) and later into , which were enlarged letters at the beginning of a paragraph.

=== Use in Latin ===
The above notation soon changed to the letter , an abbreviation for the Latin word , which translates as &quot;head&quot;, i.e. it marks the head of a new thesis. Eventually, to mark a new section, the Latin word , which translates as &quot;little head&quot;, was used, and the letter came to mark a new section, or chapter, in 300 BC.

=== Use in Middle Ages ===
In the 1100s, had completely replaced as the symbol for a new chapter. Rubricators eventually added one or two vertical bars to the to stylize it (as ); the &quot;bowl&quot; of the symbol was filled in with dark ink and eventually looked like the modern pilcrow, .

(Scribes would often leave space before paragraphs to allow rubricators to add a hand-drawn pilcrow in contrasting ink. With the introduction of the printing press from the late medieval period on, space before paragraphs was still left for rubricators to complete by hand. However in some circumstances, rubricators could not draw fast enough for publishers&#x27; deadlines and books would often be sold with the beginnings of the paragraphs left blank. This is how the practice of before paragraphs was created.)

== Modern use ==
The pilcrow remains in use in modern documents in the following ways:

* In legal writing, it is often used whenever one cites a specific paragraph within pleadings, law review articles, statutes, or other legal documents and materials. It is also used to indicate a paragraph break within quoted text.
* In academic writing, it is sometimes used as an in-text referencing tool to make reference to a specific paragraph from a document that does not contain page numbers, allowing the reader to find where that particular idea or statistic was sourced. The pilcrow sign followed by a number indicates the paragraph number from the top of the page. It is rarely used when citing books or journal articles.
* In web publishing style guides, a pilcrow may be used to indicate an anchor link.
* In proofreading, it indicates an instruction that one paragraph should be split into two or more separate paragraphs. The proofreader inserts the pilcrow at the point where a new paragraph should begin.
* In some high-church Anglican and Episcopal churches, it is used in the printed order of service to indicate that instructions follow; these indicate when the congregation should stand, sit, and kneel, who participates in various portions of the service, and similar information. King&#x27;s College, Cambridge uses this convention in the service booklet for the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols. This is analogous to the writing of these instructions in red in some rubrication conventions.

The pilcrow is also often used in word processing and desktop publishing software:

* As the toolbar icon used to toggle the display of formatting marks, such as tabs and paragraph breaks.
** As the symbol for a paragraph break, shown when display is requested.

The pilcrow may indicate a footnote in a convention that uses a set of distinct typographic symbols in turn to distinguish between footnotes on a given page; it is the sixth in a series of footnote symbols beginning with the asterisk. (The modern convention is to use numbers or letters in superscript form.)

== Encoding ==
The pilcrow character was encoded in the 1984 Multinational Character Set (Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s extension to ASCII) at 0xB6 (decimal 182), subsequently adopted by ISO/IEC 8859-1 (&quot;ISO Latin-1&quot;, 1987) at the same code point, and thence by Unicode as . In addition, Unicode also defines , , and . The capitulum character is obsolete, being replaced by pilcrow, but is included in Unicode for backward compatibility and historic studies.

The pilcrow symbol was included in the default hardware codepage 437 of IBM PCs (and all other 8-bit OEM codepages based on this) at code point 20 (0x14), which is an ASCII control character.

=== Keyboard entry ===
* Windows: or (both on the numeric keypad) 
** Microsoft US international keyboard layout: 
* Classic Mac OS and macOS: 
* Linux and ChromeOS: 
** Linux with compose key: 
** ChromeOS with UK-International keyboard layout: 
* HTML: (introduced in HTML 3.2 (1997)), or 
* Vim, in insert mode:     (upper-case i, not a digit 1 or a lower-case letter L)
* TeX: codice_1
* LaTeX: codice_1 or codice_3
* Android phones (Gboard): 
*Apple iPhones and iPads may require the user to set up a text replacement shortcut without installing custom keyboard software. Tools may be required to easily generate a pilcrow, or other special characters.

== Paragraph signs in non-Latin writing systems ==
In Sanskrit and other Indian languages, text blocks are commonly written in stanzas. Two vertical bars, ॥, called a &quot;double &quot;daṇḍa&quot;&quot;, are the functional equivalent of a pilcrow.

In Thai, the character ๏ marks the beginning of a stanza and ฯะ or ๚ะ marks the end of a stanza.

In Amharic, the characters ፠ and ፨ can mark a section/paragraph.

In China, the 〇, which has been used as a zero character since the 12th century, has been used to mark paragraphs in older Western-made books such as the Chinese Union Version of the Bible.

<text>[[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] is an Australian state, situated at the southern end of the Great Dividing Range. The Great Dividing Range stretches along the east coast of the continent and terminates near the Victorian city of Ballarat west of the capital Melbourne, though the nearby Grampians may be considered to be the final part of the range. The highest mountains in Victoria (just under 2,000 m) are the Victorian Alps, located in the northeast of the state.

The northwest of the state is mostly Cainozoic rocks while the southeast is primarily made up of Palaeozoic rocks. There have been no discoveries of Precambrian rocks in Victoria.

The low flat northwest of the state that borders the Murray River was once the bed of an ancient sea and the land is much afflicted with salinity. Saline drainage from Victorian land is one of the sources of the salinity problem in the Murray–Darling River system. Commercial salt evaporation is undertaken near Swan Hill.

Central and western Victoria comprise world-class vein-hosted gold deposits, hosted mostly in the extensive Ordovician turbidites.

The southeast of the state has enormous brown coal fields.

==Volcanism==
There is an area of extensive volcanism in central and southwestern Victoria, where there are numerous volcanoes and volcanic lakes. The Western Victorian Volcanic Plains are the third largest in the world after the Deccan in western India, and the Snake River Plateau in Idaho, United States. The most recent volcanic activity was at Mt Eccles, which last erupted a few thousand years ago, making it an active volcanic region. Large basaltic lava flows are present on the western side of Melbourne and in the southwest of the state.

== Neoproterozoic to early Carboniferous ==
This period is covered by the recent Geological Survey of Victoria publication &quot;The Tasman Fold Belt System in Victoria&quot;. The sequence of events associated with the building of southeastern Australia reveals that mineralization and magmatic processes are intimately linked with the tectonic development of the region. The history is dominated by east–west compression of predominantly oceanic sedimentary and igneous rocks and their resultant folding, faulting and uplift. Recently, it has become increasingly apparent that major north–south movements have also been involved in constructing eastern Australia.

The Palaeozoic basement is traversed by thrust faults more or less parallel to the north–south structural grain. The largest faults separate rocks with different ages and structural histories, and subdivide Victoria into three main structural rankings consisting of twofold belts (Delamerian and Lachlan), two terranes in the Lachlan Fold Belt (Whitelaw and Benambra), and ten structural zones (Glenelg, Grampians-Stavely, Stawell, Bendigo, Melbourne, Tabberabbera, Omeo, Deddick, Kuark, Mallacoota).

===Moyston Fault===

The Moyston Fault is the most important fault as it forms the terrane boundary between the Delamerian and Lachlan fold belts. These twofold belts show important differences. The Delamerian Fold Belt is mainly composed of Neoproterozoic-Cambrian rocks and was deformed in the Late Cambrian Delamerian Orogeny whereas the Lachlan Fold Belt contains mainly Cambrian-Devonian rocks with the main deformations occurring in the late Ordovician to early Carboniferous interval. The first regional deformation to affect the Lachlan Fold Belt was the Benambran Orogeny, about 450 MYA, after the Delamerian Orogeny. Granites comprise 20% of the total exposed area of the Lachlan Fold Belt and fall within an age range of 440 to 350 MYA. Volcanics associated with the granites are also widespread and cover an additional 5%. Blocks of older crust consisting of Neoproterozoic-Cambrian rocks, such as the Selwyn Block in central Victoria, were deformed during the late Cambrian Tyennan Orogeny prior to being incorporated into the Lachlan Fold Belt.

===Baragwanath Transform===
The second major structural break in Victoria is the Baragwanath Transform, which occurs along the eastern side of the Selwyn Block. This transform fault divides the Lachlan Fold Belt into two terranes, the Whitelaw Terrane to the west and the Benambra Terrane to the east. The main difference between these is that orogen-parallel (north-south) transport was more prevalent in the Benambra Terrane, whereas convergent east–west transport orthogonal to the orogen was dominant in the Whitelaw Terrane.

<doc id="63258" wikidata="Q42559" url="?curid=63258" title="Cornish Rex">
<text>The Cornish Rex is a breed of domestic cat. The Cornish Rex only has down hair. Most breeds of cat have three different types of hair in their coats: the outer fur or &quot;guard hairs&quot;, a middle layer called the &quot;awn hair&quot;; and the down hair or undercoat, which is very fine and about 1 cm long. Cornish Rexes only have the undercoat. The curl in their fur is caused by a different mutation and gene than that of the Devon Rex. The breed originated in Cornwall, Great Britain.

==Characteristics==
The coat of a Cornish Rex is extremely fine and naturally curly. Their light coat means that they are best suited for indoor living in warm and dry conditions, as they are sensitive to low temperatures.

The breed is sometimes referred to as the Greyhound of the cats, because of the sleek appearance and the galloping run characteristic of the breed.

===Appearance===
According to the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) standard, the Cornish Rex&#x27;s colour is irrelevant — therefore the cat may be any colour.

Aside from the distinctive coat, the Cornish Rex is set apart by its &#x27;foreign type&#x27;, slender legs and tail, oval eyes, and wedge shaped head. The Cornish Rex&#x27;s ears are large and wide at the base with rounded tips and are described as being almost mussel shell shaped. The eyes are medium in size and come in all varieties of eye colour. The body is slender and muscular with small paws.

==Genetics==
In 2013, researchers identified the mutation that defines the Cornish Rex breed. Genome-wide analyses were performed in the Cornish Rex breed and in 11 phenotypically diverse breeds and two random bred populations. A gene on chromosome A1, the lysophosphatidic acid receptor 6 (&quot;LPAR6&quot;), was identified to have a 4 base pair deletion. This induces a premature stop codon in the receptor that is absent in all straight haired cats analyzed. &quot;LPAR6&quot; encodes a receptor essential for maintaining the structural integrity of the hair shaft. In humans, LPAR6 mutations result in a form of ectodermal dysplasia characterised by a woolly hair phenotype.

== Origin ==
The Cornish Rex is a genetic mutation that originated from a litter of kittens born in the 1950s on a farm in Cornwall, UK. One of the kittens, a cream-colored male named Kallibunker, had an extremely unusual, fine and curly coat; he was the first Cornish Rex. The owner then backcrossed Kallibunker to his mother to produce 2 other curly-coated kittens. The male, Poldhu, sired a female called Lamorna Cove who was later brought to America and crossed with a Siamese, giving the breed their long whippy tails and big ears.

The Devon Rex looks similar in appearance to the Cornish Rex but has guard hairs and sheds. The Devon Rex mutation is different from the Cornish Rex mutation in that the Devon has shortened guard hairs, while the Cornish Rex lacks guard hairs altogether.


== Hypoallergenic ==

Despite some belief to the contrary, the Cornish Rex&#x27;s short hair does not make it non- or hypo-allergenic. Allergic reactions from cats are not the result of hair length, but from a glycoprotein known as Fel d 1, produced in the sebaceous glands of the skin, saliva, and urine. Most people who have cat allergies are reacting to this protein in cat saliva and cat dander: when the cat cleans its fur, the saliva dries and is transformed into dust that people breathe in. Since Cornish Rex cats groom as much as or even more than ordinary cats, a Cornish Rex cat can still produce a reaction in people who are allergic to cats. It is, however, widely reported to cause lesser to little allergic reaction.

<text>Financial economics is the branch of economics characterized by a &quot;concentration on monetary activities&quot;, in which &quot;money of one type or another is likely to appear on &quot;both sides&quot; of a trade&quot;. 
Its concern is thus the interrelation of financial variables, such as share prices, interest rates and exchange rates, as opposed to those concerning the real economy. 
It has two main areas of focus: asset pricing and corporate finance; the first being the perspective of providers of capital, i.e. investors, and the second of users of capital.
It thus provides the theoretical underpinning for much of finance.

The subject is concerned with &quot;the allocation and deployment of economic resources, both spatially and across time, in an uncertain environment&quot;. It therefore centers on decision making under uncertainty in the context of the financial markets, and the resultant economic and financial models and principles, and is concerned with deriving testable or policy implications from acceptable assumptions. 
It thus also includes a formal study of the financial markets themselves, especially market microstructure and market regulation.
It is built on the foundations of microeconomics and decision theory.

Financial econometrics is the branch of financial economics that uses econometric techniques to parameterise the relationships identified.
Mathematical finance is related in that it will derive and extend the mathematical or numerical models suggested by financial economics.
Whereas financial economics has a primarily microeconomic focus, monetary economics is primarily macroeconomic in nature.

==Underlying economics==

Financial economics studies how rational investors would apply decision theory to investment management. The subject is thus built on the foundations of microeconomics and derives several key results for the application of decision making under uncertainty to the financial markets. The underlying economic logic yields the fundamental theorem of asset pricing, which gives the conditions for arbitrage-free asset pricing.
The various &quot;fundamental&quot; valuation formulae result directly.

===Present value, expectation and utility===
Underlying all of financial economics are the concepts of present value and expectation.

Calculating their present value, formula_1 in the first formula, allows the decision maker to aggregate the cashflows (or other returns) to be produced by the asset in the future to a single value at the date in question, and to thus more readily compare two opportunities; this concept is then the starting point for financial decision making. 

(Note that here, &quot;formula_2&quot; represents a generic (or arbitrary) discount rate applied to the cash flows, whereas in the valuation formulae, the risk-free rate is applied once these have been &quot;adjusted&quot; for their riskiness; see below.)

An immediate extension is to combine probabilities with present value, leading to the expected value criterion which sets asset value as a function of the sizes of the expected payouts and the probabilities of their occurrence, formula_3 and formula_4 respectively. 

This decision method, however, fails to consider risk aversion. In other words, since individuals receive greater utility from an extra dollar when they are poor and less utility when comparatively rich, the approach is therefore to &quot;adjust&quot; the weight assigned to the various outcomes, i.e. &quot;states&quot;, correspondingly: formula_5. See indifference price. (Some investors may in fact be risk seeking as opposed to risk averse, but the same logic would apply.)

Choice under uncertainty here may then be defined as the maximization of expected utility. More formally, the resulting expected utility hypothesis states that, if certain axioms are satisfied, the subjective value associated with a gamble by an individual is &quot;that individual&quot;″s statistical expectation of the valuations of the outcomes of that gamble.

The impetus for these ideas arises from various inconsistencies observed under the expected value framework, such as the St. Petersburg paradox and the Ellsberg paradox. 

===Arbitrage-free pricing and equilibrium===

The concepts of arbitrage-free, &quot;rational&quot;, pricing and equilibrium are then coupled 

with the above to derive various of the &quot;classical&quot; (or &quot;neo-classical&quot;) financial economics models.

Rational pricing is the assumption that asset prices (and hence asset pricing models) will reflect the arbitrage-free price of the asset, as any deviation from this price will be &quot;arbitraged away&quot;. This assumption is useful in pricing fixed income securities, particularly bonds, and is fundamental to the pricing of derivative instruments.

Economic equilibrium is a state in which economic forces such as supply and demand are balanced, and in the absence of external influences these equilibrium values of economic variables will not change. General equilibrium deals with the behavior of supply, demand, and prices in a whole economy with several or many interacting markets, by seeking to prove that a set of prices exists that will result in an overall equilibrium. (This is in contrast to partial equilibrium, which only analyzes single markets.)

The two concepts are linked as follows: where market prices are complete and do not allow profitable arbitrage, i.e. they comprise an arbitrage-free market, then these prices are also said to constitute an &quot;arbitrage equilibrium&quot;. Intuitively, this may be seen by considering that where an arbitrage opportunity does exist, then prices can be expected to change, and they are therefore not in equilibrium. An arbitrage equilibrium is thus a precondition for a general economic equilibrium.

&quot;Complete&quot; here means that there is a price for every asset in every possible state of the world, formula_6, and that the complete set of possible bets on future states-of-the-world can therefore be constructed with existing assets (assuming no friction): essentially solving simultaneously for &quot;n&quot; (risk-neutral) probabilities, formula_7, given &quot;n&quot; prices. For a simplified example see , where the economy has only two possible states – up and down – and where formula_8 and formula_9 () are the two corresponding probabilities, and in turn, the derived distribution, or &quot;measure&quot;.

The formal derivation will proceed by arbitrage arguments. The analysis here is often undertaken assuming a &quot;representative agent&quot;, essentially treating all market participants, &quot;agents&quot;, as identical (or, at least, assuming that they act in such a way that the sum of their choices is equivalent to the decision of one individual) with the effect that the problems are then mathematically tractable.

With this measure in place, the expected, i.e. required, return of any security (or portfolio) will then equal the risk-free return, plus an &quot;adjustment for risk&quot;, i.e. a security-specific risk premium, compensating for the extent to which its cashflows are unpredictable. All pricing models are then essentially variants of this, given specific assumptions or conditions. This approach is consistent with the above, but with the expectation based on &quot;the market&quot; (i.e. arbitrage-free, and, per the theorem, therefore in equilibrium) as opposed to individual preferences.

Continuing the example, in pricing a derivative instrument, its forecasted cashflows in the abovementioned up- and down-states formula_10 and formula_11, are multiplied through by formula_8 and formula_9, and are then discounted at the risk-free interest rate; per the second equation above. In pricing a &quot;fundamental&quot;, underlying, instrument (in equilibrium), on the other hand, a risk-appropriate premium over risk-free is required in the discounting, essentially employing the first equation with formula_14 and formula_2 combined. This premium may be derived by the CAPM (or extensions) as will be seen under .

The difference is explained as follows: By construction, the value of the derivative will (must) grow at the risk free rate, and, by arbitrage arguments, its value must then be discounted correspondingly; in the case of an option, this is achieved by &quot;manufacturing&quot; the instrument as a combination of the underlying and a risk free &quot;bond&quot;; see (and below). Where the underlying is itself being priced, such &quot;manufacturing&quot; is of course not possible – the instrument being &quot;fundamental&quot;, i.e. as opposed to &quot;derivative&quot; – and a premium is then required for risk.

(Correspondingly, mathematical finance separates into two analytic regimes:
risk and portfolio management (generally) use physical (or actual or actuarial) probability, denoted by &quot;P&quot;; while derivatives pricing uses risk-neutral probability (or arbitrage-pricing probability), denoted by &quot;Q&quot;.
In specific applications the lower case is used, as in the above equations.)

===State prices===
With the above relationship established, the further specialized Arrow–Debreu model may be derived. 

This result suggests that, under certain economic conditions, there must be a set of prices such that aggregate supplies will equal aggregate demands for every commodity in the economy. 
The Arrow–Debreu model applies to economies with maximally complete markets, in which there exists a market for every time period and forward prices for every commodity at all time periods.

A direct extension, then, is the concept of a state price security, also called an Arrow–Debreu security, a contract that agrees to pay one unit of a numeraire (a currency or a commodity) if a particular state occurs (&quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot; in the simplified example above) at a particular time in the future and pays zero numeraire in all the other states. The price of this security is the &quot;state price&quot; formula_16 of this particular state of the world; the collection of these is also referred to as a &quot;Risk Neutral Density&quot;.

In the above example, the state prices, formula_17, formula_18would equate to the present values of formula_19 and formula_20: i.e. what one would pay today, respectively, for the up- and down-state securities; the state price vector is the vector of state prices for all states. Applied to derivative valuation, the price today would simply be : the fourth formula (see above regarding the absence of a risk premium here). For a continuous random variable indicating a continuum of possible states, the value is found by integrating over the state price &quot;density&quot;.

State prices find immediate application as a conceptual tool (&quot;contingent claim analysis&quot;); but can also be applied to valuation problems. Given the pricing mechanism described, one can decompose the derivative value – true in fact for &quot;every security&quot; – as a linear combination of its state-prices; i.e. back-solve for the state-prices corresponding to observed derivative prices. 
These recovered state-prices can then be used for valuation of other instruments with exposure to the underlyer, or for other decision making relating to the underlyer itself.

Using the related stochastic discount factor - also called the pricing kernel - the asset price is computed by &quot;discounting&quot; the future cash flow by the stochastic factor formula_21, and then taking the expectation;
the third equation above. Essentially, this factor divides expected utility at the relevant future period - a function of the possible asset values realized under each state - by the utility due to today&#x27;s wealth, and is then also referred to as &quot;the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution&quot;.

==Resultant models==
Applying the above economic concepts, we may then derive various economic- and financial models and principles. As above, the two usual areas of focus are Asset Pricing and Corporate Finance, the first being the perspective of providers of capital, the second of users of capital. Here, and for (almost) all other financial economics models, the questions addressed are typically framed in terms of &quot;time, uncertainty, options, and information&quot;, as will be seen below.
* Time: money now is traded for money in the future.
* Uncertainty (or risk): The amount of money to be transferred in the future is uncertain.
* Options: one party to the transaction can make a decision at a later time that will affect subsequent transfers of money.
* Information: knowledge of the future can reduce, or possibly eliminate, the uncertainty associated with future monetary value (FMV).
Applying this framework, with the above concepts, leads to the required models. This derivation begins with the assumption of &quot;no uncertainty&quot; and is then expanded to incorporate the other considerations. (This division sometimes denoted &quot;deterministic&quot; and &quot;random&quot;, or &quot;stochastic&quot;.)

===Certainty===
The starting point here is &quot;Investment under certainty&quot;, and usually framed in the context of a corporation.
The Fisher separation theorem, asserts that the objective of the corporation will be the maximization of its present value, regardless of the preferences of its shareholders. 
Related is the Modigliani–Miller theorem, which shows that, under certain conditions, the value of a firm is unaffected by how that firm is financed, and depends neither on its dividend policy nor its decision to raise capital by issuing stock or selling debt. The proof here proceeds using arbitrage arguments, and acts as a benchmark for evaluating the effects of factors outside the model that do affect value.
The mechanism for determining (corporate) value is provided by
John Burr Williams&#x27; &quot;The Theory of Investment Value&quot;, which proposes that the value of an asset should be calculated using &quot;evaluation by the rule of present worth&quot;. Thus, for a common stock, the &quot;intrinsic&quot;, long-term worth is the present value of its future net cashflows, in the form of dividends. What remains to be determined is the appropriate discount rate. Later developments show that, &quot;rationally&quot;, i.e. in the formal sense, the appropriate discount rate here will (should) depend on the asset&#x27;s riskiness relative to the overall market, as opposed to its owners&#x27; preferences; see below. Net present value (NPV) is the direct extension of these ideas typically applied to Corporate Finance decisioning. For other results, as well as specific models developed here, see the list of &quot;Equity valuation&quot; topics under .
Bond valuation, in that cashflows (coupons and return of principal, or &quot;Face value&quot;) are deterministic, may proceed in the same fashion. An immediate extension, Arbitrage-free bond pricing, discounts each cashflow at the market derived rate – i.e. at each coupon&#x27;s corresponding zero rate, and of equivalent credit worthiness – as opposed to an overall rate.
In many treatments bond valuation precedes equity valuation, under which cashflows (dividends) are not &quot;known&quot; &quot;per se&quot;. Williams and onward allow for forecasting as to these – based on historic ratios or published dividend policy – and cashflows are then treated as essentially deterministic; see below under .

For both stocks and bonds, &quot;under certainty, with the focus on cash flows from securities over time,&quot; valuation based on a term structure of interest rates is in fact consistent with arbitrage-free pricing.
Indeed, a corollary of the above is that &quot;the law of one price implies the existence of a discount factor&quot;;
correspondingly, as formulated, .

Whereas these &quot;certainty&quot; results are all commonly employed under corporate finance, uncertainty is the focus of &quot;asset pricing models&quot; as follows. Fisher&#x27;s formulation of the theory here - developing an intertemporal equilibrium model - underpins also the below applications to uncertainty; 

see for the development.

===Uncertainty===



For &quot;choice under uncertainty&quot; the twin assumptions of rationality and market efficiency, as more closely defined, lead to modern portfolio theory (MPT) with its capital asset pricing model (CAPM) – an &quot;equilibrium-based&quot; result – and to the Black–Scholes–Merton theory (BSM; often, simply Black–Scholes) for option pricing – an &quot;arbitrage-free&quot; result. As above, the (intuitive) link between these, is that the latter derivative prices are calculated such that they are arbitrage-free with respect to the more fundamental, equilibrium determined, securities prices; see .

Briefly, and intuitively – and consistent with above – the relationship between rationality and efficiency is as follows. 
Given the ability to profit from private information, self-interested traders are motivated to acquire and act on their private information. In doing so, traders contribute to more and more &quot;correct&quot;, i.e. &quot;efficient&quot;, prices: the efficient-market hypothesis, or EMH. Thus, if prices of financial assets are (broadly) efficient, then deviations from these (equilibrium) values could not last for long. (See earnings response coefficient.)
The EMH (implicitly) assumes that average expectations constitute an &quot;optimal forecast&quot;, i.e. prices using all available information are identical to the &quot;best guess of the future&quot;: the assumption of rational expectations. 
The EMH does allow that when faced with new information, some investors may overreact and some may underreact, 

but what is required, however, is that investors&#x27; reactions follow a normal distribution – so that the net effect on market prices cannot be reliably exploited to make an abnormal profit.
In the competitive limit, then, market prices will reflect all available information and prices can only move in response to news: the random walk hypothesis. 
This news, of course, could be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;, minor or, less common, major; and these moves are then, correspondingly, normally distributed; with the price therefore following a log-normal distribution. 
Under these conditions, investors can then be assumed to act rationally: their investment decision must be calculated or a loss is sure to follow; correspondingly, where an arbitrage opportunity presents itself, then arbitrageurs will exploit it, reinforcing this equilibrium.
Here, as under the certainty-case above, the specific assumption as to pricing is that prices are calculated as the present value of expected future dividends,
 
as based on currently available information.
What is required though, is a theory for determining the appropriate discount rate, i.e. &quot;required return&quot;, given this uncertainty: this is provided by the MPT and its CAPM. Relatedly, rationality – in the sense of arbitrage-exploitation – gives rise to Black–Scholes; option values here ultimately consistent with the CAPM.

In general, then, while portfolio theory studies how investors should balance risk and return when investing in many assets or securities, the CAPM is more focused, describing how, in equilibrium, markets set the prices of assets in relation to how risky they are.

This result will be independent of the investor&#x27;s level of risk aversion and assumed utility function, thus providing a readily determined discount rate for corporate finance decision makers as above, and for other investors.
The argument proceeds as follows:
If one can construct an efficient frontier – i.e. each combination of assets offering the best possible expected level of return for its level of risk, see diagram – then mean-variance efficient portfolios can be formed simply as a combination of holdings of the risk-free asset and the &quot;market portfolio&quot; (the Mutual fund separation theorem), with the combinations here plotting as the capital market line, or CML. 
Then, given this CML, the required return on a risky security will be independent of the investor&#x27;s utility function, and solely determined by its covariance (&quot;beta&quot;) with aggregate, i.e. market, risk. 
This is because investors here can then maximize utility through leverage as opposed to stock selection; see Separation property (finance), and CML diagram aside. 
As can be seen in the formula aside, this result is consistent with the preceding, equaling the riskless return plus an adjustment for risk. 
A more modern, direct, derivation is as described at the bottom of this section; which can be generalized to derive other equilibrium-pricing models.

Black–Scholes provides a mathematical model of a financial market containing derivative instruments, and the resultant formula for the price of European-styled options.

The model is expressed as the Black–Scholes equation, a partial differential equation describing the changing price of the option over time; it is derived assuming log-normal, geometric Brownian motion (see Brownian model of financial markets).
The key financial insight behind the model is that one can perfectly hedge the option by buying and selling the underlying asset in just the right way and consequently &quot;eliminate risk&quot;, absenting the risk adjustment from the pricing (formula_22, the value, or price, of the option, grows at formula_2, the risk-free rate).
This hedge, in turn, implies that there is only one right price – in an arbitrage-free sense – for the option. And this price is returned by the Black–Scholes option pricing formula. (The formula, and hence the price, is consistent with the equation, as the formula is the solution to the equation.)
Since the formula is without reference to the share&#x27;s expected return, Black–Scholes inheres risk neutrality; intuitively consistent with the &quot;elimination of risk&quot; here, and mathematically consistent with above. Relatedly, therefore, the pricing formula may also be derived directly via risk neutral expectation.
Itô&#x27;s lemma provides the underlying mathematics, and, with Itô calculus more generally, remains fundamental in quantitative finance.
As implied by the Fundamental Theorem, the two major results are consistent. 
Here, the Black-Scholes equation can alternatively be derived from the CAPM, and the price obtained from the Black–Scholes model is thus consistent with the assumptions of the CAPM. 
The Black–Scholes theory, although built on Arbitrage-free pricing, is therefore consistent with the equilibrium based capital asset pricing. 
Both models, in turn, are ultimately consistent with the Arrow–Debreu theory, and can be derived via state-pricing – essentially, by expanding the above fundamental equations – further explaining, and if required demonstrating, this consistency. 
Here, the CAPM is derived by linking formula_14, risk aversion, to overall market return, and setting the return on security formula_25 as formula_26; see .
The Black–Scholes formula is found, in the limit, by attaching a binomial probability to each of numerous possible spot-prices (i.e. states) and then rearranging for the terms corresponding to formula_27 and formula_28, per the boxed description; see .

==Extensions==
More recent work further generalizes and extends these models. As regards asset pricing, developments in equilibrium-based pricing are discussed under &quot;Portfolio theory&quot; below, while &quot;Derivative pricing&quot; relates to risk-neutral, i.e. arbitrage-free, pricing. As regards the use of capital, &quot;Corporate finance theory&quot; relates, mainly, to the application of these models.

===Portfolio theory===

The majority of developments here relate to required return, i.e. pricing, extending the basic CAPM. Multi-factor models such as the Fama–French three-factor model and the Carhart four-factor model, propose factors other than market return as relevant in pricing. The intertemporal CAPM and consumption-based CAPM similarly extend the model. With intertemporal portfolio choice, the investor now repeatedly optimizes her portfolio; while the inclusion of consumption (in the economic sense) then incorporates all sources of wealth, and not just market-based investments, into the investor&#x27;s calculation of required return.

Whereas the above extend the CAPM, the single-index model is a more simple model. It assumes, only, a correlation between security and market returns, without (numerous) other economic assumptions. It is useful in that it simplifies the estimation of correlation between securities, significantly reducing the inputs for building the correlation matrix required for portfolio optimization. The arbitrage pricing theory (APT) similarly differs as regards its assumptions. APT &quot;gives up the notion that there is one right portfolio for everyone in the world, and ...replaces it with an explanatory model of what drives asset returns.&quot; It returns the required (expected) return of a financial asset as a linear function of various macro-economic factors, and assumes that arbitrage should bring incorrectly priced assets back into line.
The linear factor model structure of the APT is used as the basis for many of the commercial risk systems employed by asset managers.

As regards portfolio optimization, the Black–Litterman model 
departs from the original Markowitz model – i.e. of constructing portfolios via an efficient frontier. Black–Litterman instead starts with an equilibrium assumption, and is then modified to take into account the &#x27;views&#x27; (i.e., the specific opinions about asset returns) of the investor in question to arrive at a bespoke asset allocation. Where factors additional to volatility are considered (kurtosis, skew...) then multiple-criteria decision analysis can be applied; here deriving a Pareto efficient portfolio. The universal portfolio algorithm applies machine learning to asset selection, learning adaptively from historical data. Behavioral portfolio theory recognizes that investors have varied aims and create an investment portfolio that meets a broad range of goals. Copulas have lately been applied here; recently this is the case also for genetic algorithms and Machine learning, more generally. 
(Tail) risk parity focuses on allocation of risk, rather than allocation of capital.

See for other techniques and objectives, and for discussion.

===Derivative pricing===

In pricing derivatives, the binomial options pricing model provides a discretized version of Black–Scholes, useful for the valuation of American styled options. Discretized models of this type are built – at least implicitly – using state-prices (as above); relatedly, a large number of researchers have used options to extract state-prices for a variety of other applications in financial economics. For path dependent derivatives, Monte Carlo methods for option pricing are employed; here the modelling is in continuous time, but similarly uses risk neutral expected value. Various other numeric techniques have also been developed. The theoretical framework too has been extended such that martingale pricing is now the standard approach.
Drawing on these techniques, models for various other underlyings and applications have also been developed, all based on the same logic (using &quot;contingent claim analysis&quot;). Real options valuation allows that option holders can influence the option&#x27;s underlying; models for employee stock option valuation explicitly assume non-rationality on the part of option holders; Credit derivatives allow that payment obligations or delivery requirements might not be honored. Exotic derivatives are now routinely valued. Multi-asset underlyers are handled via simulation or copula based analysis.

Similarly, the various short-rate models allow for an extension of these techniques to fixed income- and interest rate derivatives. (The Vasicek and CIR models are equilibrium-based, while Ho–Lee and subsequent models are based on arbitrage-free pricing.) The more general HJM Framework describes the dynamics of the full forward-rate curve – as opposed to working with short rates – and is then more widely applied. The valuation of the underlying instrument – additional to its derivatives – is relatedly extended, particularly for hybrid securities, where credit risk is combined with uncertainty re future rates; see and . 
Following the Crash of 1987, equity options traded in American markets began to exhibit what is known as a &quot;volatility smile&quot;; that is, for a given expiration, options whose strike price differs substantially from the underlying asset&#x27;s price command higher prices, and thus implied volatilities, than what is suggested by BSM. (The pattern differs across various markets.) Modelling the volatility smile is an active area of research, and developments here – as well as implications re the standard theory – are discussed in the next section.

After the 2007–2008 financial crisis, a further development: as outlined, (over the counter) derivative pricing had relied on the BSM risk neutral pricing framework, under the assumptions of funding at the risk free rate and the ability to perfectly replicate cashflows so as to fully hedge. This, in turn, is built on the assumption of a credit-risk-free environment – called into question during the crisis. 
Addressing this, therefore, issues such as counterparty credit risk, funding costs and costs of capital are now additionally considered when pricing, and a credit valuation adjustment, or CVA – and potentially other &quot;valuation adjustments&quot;, collectively xVA – is generally added to the risk-neutral derivative value.
The standard economic arguments can be extended to incorporate these various adjustments.

A related, and perhaps more fundamental change, is that discounting is now on the Overnight Index Swap (OIS) curve, as opposed to LIBOR as used previously. This is because post-crisis, the overnight rate is considered a better proxy for the &quot;risk-free rate&quot;. (Also, practically, the interest paid on cash collateral is usually the overnight rate; OIS discounting is then, sometimes, referred to as &quot;CSA discounting&quot;.) Swap pricing – and, therefore, yield curve construction – is further modified: previously, swaps were valued off a single &quot;self discounting&quot; interest rate curve; whereas post crisis, to accommodate OIS discounting, valuation is now under a &quot;multi-curve framework&quot; where &quot;forecast curves&quot; are constructed for each floating-leg LIBOR tenor, with discounting on the &quot;common&quot; OIS curve.

===Corporate finance theory===
Mirroring the above developments, corporate finance valuations and decisioning no longer need assume &quot;certainty&quot;.
Monte Carlo methods in finance allow financial analysts to construct &quot;stochastic&quot; or probabilistic corporate finance models, as opposed to the traditional static and deterministic models; see . 
Relatedly, Real Options theory allows for owner – i.e. managerial – actions that impact underlying value: by incorporating option pricing logic, these actions are then applied to a distribution of future outcomes, changing with time, which then determine the &quot;project&#x27;s&quot; valuation today. 
More traditionally, decision trees – which are complementary – have been used to evaluate projects, by incorporating in the valuation (all) possible events (or states) and consequent management decisions; the correct discount rate here reflecting each decision-point&#x27;s &quot;non-diversifiable risk looking forward.&quot; 
Related to this, is the treatment of forecasted cashflows in equity valuation. In many cases, following Williams above, the average (or most likely) cash-flows were discounted, as opposed to a theoretically correct state-by-state treatment under uncertainty; see comments under Financial modeling § Accounting. 
In more modern treatments, then, it is the &quot;expected&quot; cashflows (in the mathematical sense: formula_29) combined into an overall value per forecast period which are discounted.


And using the CAPM – or extensions – the discounting here is at the risk-free rate plus a premium linked to the uncertainty of the entity or project cash flows

(essentially, formula_14 and formula_2 combined).

Other developments here include agency theory, which analyses the difficulties in motivating corporate management (the &quot;agent&quot;; in a different sense to the above) to act in the best interests of shareholders (the &quot;principal&quot;), rather than in their own interests; here emphasizing the issues interrelated with capital structure.
Clean surplus accounting and the related residual income valuation provide a model that returns price as a function of earnings, expected returns, and change in book value, as opposed to dividends. This approach, to some extent, arises due to the implicit contradiction of seeing value as a function of dividends, while also holding that dividend policy cannot influence value per Modigliani and Miller&#x27;s &quot;Irrelevance principle&quot;; see .

&quot;Corporate finance&quot; as a discipline more generally, building on Fisher above, relates to the long term objective of maximizing the value of the firm - and its return to shareholders - and thus also incorporates the areas of capital structure and dividend policy. 

Extensions of the theory here then also consider these latter, as follows:
(i) optimization re capitalization structure, and theories here as to corporate choices and behavior: Capital structure substitution theory, Pecking order theory, Market timing hypothesis, Trade-off theory;
(ii) considerations and analysis re dividend policy, additional to - and sometimes contrasting with - Modigliani-Miller, include: 
the Walter model, Lintner model, Residuals theory and signaling hypothesis, as well as discussion re the observed clientele effect and dividend puzzle.

As described, the typical application of real options is to capital budgeting type problems. 
However, here, they are also applied to problems of capital structure and dividend policy, and to the related design of corporate securities;
and since stockholder and bondholders have different objective functions, in the analysis of the related agency problems.
In all of these cases, state-prices can provide the market-implied information relating to the corporate, as above, which is then applied to the analysis. For example, convertible bonds can (must) be priced consistent with the (recovered) state-prices of the corporate&#x27;s equity.

===Financial markets===
The discipline, as outlined, also includes a formal study of financial markets. Of interest especially are market regulation and market microstructure, and their relationship to price efficiency.

Regulatory economics studies, in general, the economics of regulation. In the context of finance, it will address the impact of financial regulation on the functioning of markets and the efficiency of prices, while also weighing the corresponding increases in market confidence and financial stability.
Research here considers how, and to what extent, regulations relating to disclosure (earnings guidance, annual reports), insider trading, and short-selling will impact price efficiency, the cost of equity, and market liquidity.

Market microstructure is concerned with the details of how exchange occurs in markets 
(with Walrasian-, matching-, Fisher-, and 
Arrow-Debreu markets as prototypes), 
and &quot;analyzes how specific trading mechanisms affect the price formation process&quot;, examining the ways in which the processes of a market affect determinants of transaction costs, prices, quotes, volume, and trading behavior.
It has been used, for example, in providing explanations for long-standing exchange rate puzzles, and for the equity premium puzzle. 
In contrast to the above classical approach, models here explicitly allow for (testing the impact of) market frictions and other imperfections;
see also market design.

For both regulation and microstructure, and generally, agent-based models can be developed to examine any impact due to a change in structure or policy - or to make inferences re market dynamics - by testing these in an artificial financial market, or AFM.

This approach, essentially simulated trade between numerous agents, &quot;typically uses artificial intelligence technologies [often genetic algorithms and neural nets] to represent the adaptive behaviour of market participants&quot;.

These &#x27;bottom-up&#x27; models &quot;start from first principals of agent behavior&quot;, with participants modifying their trading strategies having learned over time, and &quot;are able to describe macro features [i.e. stylized facts] emerging from a soup of individual interacting strategies&quot;.
Agent-based models depart further from the classical approach — the representative agent, as outlined — in that they introduce heterogeneity into the environment (thereby addressing, also, the aggregation problem).

==Challenges and criticism==
As above, there is a very close link between:
the random walk hypothesis, with the associated belief that price changes should follow a normal distribution, on the one hand; 
and market efficiency and rational expectations, on the other.
Wide departures from these are commonly observed, and there are thus, respectively, two main sets of challenges.

===Departures from normality===


As discussed, the assumptions that market prices follow a random walk and that asset returns are normally distributed are fundamental. Empirical evidence, however, suggests that these assumptions may not hold, and that in practice, traders, analysts and risk managers frequently modify the &quot;standard models&quot; (see Kurtosis risk, Skewness risk, Long tail, Model risk). 
In fact, Benoit Mandelbrot had discovered already in the 1960s 
that changes in financial prices do not follow a normal distribution, the basis for much option pricing theory, although this observation was slow to find its way into mainstream financial economics.
Financial models with long-tailed distributions and volatility clustering have been introduced to overcome problems with the realism of the above &quot;classical&quot; financial models; while jump diffusion models allow for (option) pricing incorporating &quot;jumps&quot; in the spot price. 
Risk managers, similarly, complement (or substitute) the standard value at risk models with historical simulations, mixture models, principal component analysis, extreme value theory, as well as models for volatility clustering. 
For further discussion see , and . Portfolio managers, likewise, have modified their optimization criteria and algorithms; see above.

Closely related is the volatility smile, where, as above, implied volatility – the volatility corresponding to the BSM price – is observed to &quot;differ&quot; as a function of strike price (i.e. moneyness), true only if the price-change distribution is non-normal, unlike that assumed by BSM. The term structure of volatility describes how (implied) volatility differs for related options with different maturities. An implied volatility surface is then a three-dimensional surface plot of volatility smile and term structure. These empirical phenomena negate the assumption of constant volatility – and log-normality – upon which Black–Scholes is built. 
Within institutions, the function of Black–Scholes is now, largely, to &quot;communicate&quot; prices via implied volatilities, much like bond prices are communicated via YTM; see .

In consequence traders (and risk managers) now, instead, use &quot;smile-consistent&quot; models, firstly, when valuing derivatives not directly mapped to the surface, facilitating the pricing of other, i.e. non-quoted, strike/maturity combinations, or of non-European derivatives, and generally for hedging purposes. 
The two main approaches are local volatility and stochastic volatility. The first returns the volatility which is &quot;local&quot; to each spot-time point of the finite difference- or simulation-based valuation; i.e. as opposed to implied volatility, which holds overall. In this way calculated prices – and numeric structures – are market-consistent in an arbitrage-free sense. The second approach assumes that the volatility of the underlying price is a stochastic process rather than a constant. Models here are first calibrated to observed prices, and are then applied to the valuation or hedging in question; the most common are Heston, SABR and CEV. This approach addresses certain problems identified with hedging under local volatility.

Related to local volatility are the lattice-based implied-binomial and -trinomial trees – essentially a discretization of the approach – which are similarly, but less commonly, used for pricing; these are built on state-prices recovered from the surface. Edgeworth binomial trees allow for a specified (i.e. non-Gaussian) skew and kurtosis in the spot price; priced here, options with differing strikes will return differing implied volatilities, and the tree can be calibrated to the smile as required. 
Similarly purposed (and derived) closed-form models were also developed.
As discussed, additional to assuming log-normality in returns, &quot;classical&quot; BSM-type models also (implicitly) assume the existence of a credit-risk-free environment, where one can perfectly replicate cashflows so as to fully hedge, and then discount at &quot;the&quot; risk-free-rate. 
And therefore, post crisis, the various x-value adjustments must be employed, effectively correcting the risk-neutral value for counterparty- and funding-related risk.
These xVA are &quot;additional&quot; to any smile or surface effect. This is valid as the surface is built on price data relating to fully collateralized positions, and there is therefore no &quot;double counting&quot; of credit risk (etc.) when appending xVA. (Were this not the case, then each counterparty would have its own surface...)

As mentioned at top, mathematical finance (and particularly financial engineering) is more concerned with mathematical consistency (and market realities) than compatibility with economic theory, and the above &quot;extreme event&quot; approaches, smile-consistent modeling, and valuation adjustments should then be seen in this light. Recognizing this, critics of financial economics - especially vocal since the 2007–2008 financial crisis - suggest that instead, the theory needs revisiting almost entirely: 
:&quot;The current system, based on the idea that risk is distributed in the shape of a bell curve, is flawed... The problem is [that economists and practitioners] never abandon the bell curve. They are like medieval astronomers who believe the sun revolves around the earth and are furiously tweaking their geo-centric math in the face of contrary evidence. They will never get this right; they need their Copernicus.&quot;

===Departures from rationality===
As seen, a common assumption is that financial decision makers act rationally; see Homo economicus. Recently, however, researchers in experimental economics and experimental finance have challenged this assumption empirically. These assumptions are also challenged theoretically, by behavioral finance, a discipline primarily concerned with the limits to rationality of economic agents.

For related criticisms re corporate finance theory vs its practice see:.

Various persistent market anomalies have also been documented as consistent with and complementary to price or return distortions – e.g. size premiums – which appear to contradict the efficient-market hypothesis. Within these market anomalies, calendar effects are the most commonly referenced group.
Related to these are various of the economic puzzles, concerning phenomena similarly contradicting the theory. The &quot;equity premium puzzle&quot;, as one example, arises in that the difference between the observed returns on stocks as compared to government bonds is consistently higher than the risk premium rational equity investors should demand, an &quot;abnormal return&quot;. For further context see Random walk hypothesis § A non-random walk hypothesis, and sidebar for specific instances.

More generally, and, again, particularly following the 2007–2008 financial crisis, financial economics (and mathematical finance) has been subjected to deeper criticism.
Notable here is Nassim Nicholas Taleb, whose critique overlaps the above, but extends also to the institutional 

aspects of (academic) finance.
His Black swan theory posits that although events of large magnitude and consequence play a major role in finance, since these are (statistically) unexpected, they are &quot;ignored&quot; by economists and traders. 
Thus, although a &quot;Taleb distribution&quot; - which normally provides a payoff of small positive returns, while carrying a small but significant risk of catastrophic losses - more realistically describes markets than current models, the latter continue to be preferred (even with professionals here acknowledging that it only &quot;generally works&quot; or only &quot;works on average&quot;).
Here, financial crises have been a topic of interest 
and, in particular, the failure of (financial) economists - as well as bankers and regulators - to model and predict these.
See .
The related problem of systemic risk, has also received attention. Where companies hold securities in each other, then this interconnectedness may entail a &quot;valuation chain&quot; – and the performance of one company, or security, here will impact all, a phenomenon not easily modeled, regardless of whether the individual models are correct. See: Systemic risk § Inadequacy of classic valuation models; Cascades in financial networks; Flight-to-quality.

Areas of research attempting to explain (or at least model) these phenomena, and crises, include market microstructure and Heterogeneous agent models, as above. The latter is extended to agent-based computational models; here, as mentioned, price is treated as an emergent phenomenon, resulting from the interaction of the various market participants (agents). The noisy market hypothesis argues that prices can be influenced by speculators and momentum traders, as well as by insiders and institutions that often buy and sell stocks for reasons unrelated to fundamental value; see Noise (economic) and Noise trader. The adaptive market hypothesis is an attempt to reconcile the efficient market hypothesis with behavioral economics, by applying the principles of evolution to financial interactions. An information cascade, alternatively, shows market participants engaging in the same acts as others (&quot;herd behavior&quot;), despite contradictions with their private information. Copula-based modelling has similarly been applied. See also Hyman Minsky&#x27;s &quot;financial instability hypothesis&quot;, as well as George Soros&#x27; application of &quot;reflexivity&quot;.
In the alternative, institutionally inherent limits to arbitrage - i.e. as opposed to factors directly contradictory to the theory - are sometimes referenced.

Note however, that despite the above inefficiencies, asset prices do &quot;effectively&quot; follow a random walk - i.e. in the sense that &quot;changes in the stock market are unpredictable, lacking any pattern that can be used by an investor to beat the overall market&quot;. Thus after fund costs - and given other considerations - it is difficult to consistently outperform market averages 
and achieve &quot;alpha&quot;.
The practical implication is that passive investing, i.e. via low-cost index funds, should, on average, serve better than any other active strategy, 

and, in fact, is now widely adopted.
Here, however, the following concern is posited:
although in concept, it is &quot;the research undertaken by active managers [that] keeps prices closer to value... [and] thus there is a fragile equilibrium in which some investors choose to index while the rest continue to search for mispriced securities&quot;; 
in practice, as more investors &quot;pour money into index funds tracking the same stocks, valuations for those companies become inflated&quot;, potentially leading to asset bubbles.

<doc id="63263" wikidata="Q3592876" url="?curid=63263" title="Evolution of flagella">
<text>The evolution of flagella is of great interest to biologists because the three known varieties of flagella – (eukaryotic, bacterial, and archaeal) each represent a sophisticated cellular structure that requires the interaction of many different systems.

==Eukaryotic flagellum==
There are two competing groups of models for the evolutionary origin of the eukaryotic flagellum (referred to as cilium below to distinguish it from its bacterial counterpart). Recent studies on the microtubule organizing center suggest that the most recent ancestor of all eukaryotes already had a complex flagellar apparatus.

===Endogenous, autogenous and direct filiation models===
These models argue that cilia developed from pre-existing components of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton (which has tubulin and dynein also used for other functions) as an extension of the mitotic spindle apparatus. The connection can still be seen, first in the various early-branching single-celled eukaryotes that have a microtubule basal body, where microtubules on one end form a spindle-like cone around the nucleus, while microtubules on the other end point away from the cell and form the cilium. A further connection is that the centriole, involved in the formation of the mitotic spindle in many (but not all) eukaryotes, is homologous to the cilium, and in many cases &quot;is&quot; the basal body from which the cilium grows.

An intermediate stage between spindle and cilium would be a non-swimming appendage made of microtubules with a function subject to natural selection, such as increasing surface area, helping the protozoan remain suspended in water, increasing the chances of bumping into bacteria to eat, or serving as a stalk attaching the cell to a solid substrate.

Regarding the origin of the individual protein components, a paper on the evolution of dyneins shows that the more complex protein family of ciliary dynein has an apparent ancestor in a simpler cytoplasmic dynein (which itself has evolved from the AAA protein family that occurs widely in all archea, bacteria and eukaryotes). Long-standing suspicions that tubulin was homologous to FtsZ (based on very weak sequence similarity and some behavioral similarities) were confirmed in 1998 by the independent resolution of the 3-dimensional structures of the two proteins.

===Symbiotic/endosymbiotic/exogenous models===
These models argue that the cilium evolved from a symbiotic Gracilicutes (ancestor of spirochete and Prosthecobacter) that attached to a primitive eukaryote or archaebacterium (archaea).

The modern version of the hypothesis was first proposed by Lynn Margulis. The hypothesis, though very well publicized, was never widely accepted by the experts, in contrast to Margulis&#x27; arguments for the symbiotic origin of mitochondria and chloroplasts. Margulis did strongly promote and publish versions of this hypothesis until the end of her life.

One primary point in favor of the symbiotic hypothesis was that there are eukaryotes that use symbiotic spirochetes as their motility organelles (some parabasalids inside termite guts, such as &quot;Mixotricha&quot; and &quot;Trichonympha&quot;). 
This is an example of co-option and the flexibility of biological systems, and the proposed homologies that have been reported between cilia and spirochetes have stood up to further scrutiny.

Margulis&#x27; hypothesis suggests that an archaea acquired tubulin proteins from a eubacter ancestor of Prosthecobacter. However, the homology of tubulin to the bacterial replication and cytoskeletal protein FtsZ (see Prokaryotic cytoskeleton), which was apparently native in archaea, suggesting an endogenous origin of tubulin rather than a symbiotic transfer.

==Bacterial flagellum==
There is good evidence that the bacterial flagellum includes and might even be based on a Type III secretory and transport system, given the similarity of proteins in both systems.

All currently known nonflagellar Type III transport systems serve the function of exporting (injecting) toxin into eukaryotic cells. Similarly, flagella grow by exporting flagellin through the flagellar machinery. It is hypothesised that the flagellum evolved from the type three secretory system. For example, the bubonic plague bacterium &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; has an organelle assembly very similar to a complex flagellum, except that it is missing only a few flagellar mechanisms and functions, such as a needle to inject toxins into other cells. As such, the type three secretory system supports the hypothesis that the flagellum evolved from a simpler bacterial secretion system.

However, the true relationship could be the reverse: recent phylogenetic research strongly suggests the type three secretory system evolved from the flagellum through a series of gene deletions.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by flagellation can cause oxidative damage to DNA and are mutagenic with researchers asking &quot;Did the innovation of a functional flagellum impact either the short- or long-term rate of bacterial evolution?&quot;.

===Eubacterial flagellum ===
Eubacterial flagellum is a multifunctional organelle. It is also one of a range of motility systems in bacteria. The structure of the organelle appears like a motor, shaft and a propeller. However, the structure of eubacterial flagellae varies based on whether their motor systems run on protons or sodium, and on the complexity of the flagellar whip. The evolutionary origin of eubacterial flagellae is probably an example of indirect evolution. A hypothesis on the evolutionary pathway of the eubacterial flagellum argues that a secretory system evolved first, based around the SMC rod- and pore-forming complex. This is presumed to be the common ancestor of the type-III secretory system and the flagellar system. Then, an ion pump was introduced to this structure which improved secretion. The ion pump later became the motor protein. This was followed by the emergence of the proto-flagellar filament as part of the protein-secretion structure. Gliding-twitching motility arose at this stage or later and was then refined into swimming motility.

==Archaeal flagellum==

The recently elucidated archaeal flagellum, or &quot;archaellum&quot;, is analogous—but not homologous—to the bacterial one. In addition to no sequence similarity being detected between the genes of the two systems, the archaeal flagellum appears to grow at the base rather than the tip, and is about 15 nanometers (nm) in diameter rather than 20.

Sequence comparison indicates that the archaeal flagellum is homologous to bacterial Type IV pili, filamentous structures outside the cell. Pilus retraction provides enables a different form of bacterial motility called &quot;twitching&quot; or &quot;social gliding&quot; which allows bacterial cells to crawl along a surface, They are assembled through the Type II secretion system. They can also promote swimming, but no species of bacteria is known to use its Type IV pili for both swimming and crawling.

==Further research==
Testable outlines exist for the origin of each of the three motility systems, and avenues for further research are clear; for prokaryotes, these avenues include the study of secretion systems in free-living, nonvirulent prokaryotes. In eukaryotes, the mechanisms of both mitosis and cilial construction, including the key role of the centriole, need to be much better understood. A detailed survey of the various nonmotile appendages found in eukaryotes is also necessary.

Finally, the study of the origin of all of these systems would benefit greatly from a resolution of the questions surrounding deep phylogeny, as to what are the most deeply branching organisms in each domain, and what are the interrelationships between the domains.

<doc id="63274" wikidata="Q44331" url="?curid=63274" title="Arthur Schnitzler">
<text>Arthur Schnitzler (15 May 1862 – 21 October 1931) was an Austrian author and dramatist. He is considered one of the most significant representatives of Viennese Modernism. Schnitzler’s works, which include psychological dramas and narratives, dissected turn-of-the-century Viennese bourgeois life, making him a sharp and stylistically conscious chronicler of Viennese society around 1900. Schnitzler&#x27;s Jewish upbringing and the sexual content of his works made them controversial or banned in his time and beyond.

== Life ==
Arthur Schnitzler was born at Praterstrasse 16, Leopoldstadt, Vienna, capital of the Austrian Empire (as of 1867, part of the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary). He was the son of a prominent Hungarian laryngologist, Johann Schnitzler (1835–1893), and Luise Markbreiter (1838–1911), a daughter of the Viennese doctor Philipp Markbreiter. His parents were both from Jewish families. In 1879 Schnitzler began studying medicine at the University of Vienna and in 1885 he received his doctorate of medicine. He began work at Vienna&#x27;s General Hospital (), but ultimately abandoned the practice of medicine in favour of writing.

On 26 August 1903, Schnitzler married Olga Gussmann (1882–1970), a 21-year-old aspiring actress and singer who came from a Jewish middle-class family. They had a son, Heinrich (1902–1982), born on 9 August 1902. In 1909 they had a daughter, Lili, who committed suicide in 1928. The Schnitzlers separated in 1921. Schnitzler died on 21 October 1931 in Vienna of a brain haemorrhage. In 1938, following the Anschluss, his son Heinrich went to the United States and did not return to Austria until 1959; he is the father of the Austrian musician and conservationist Michael Schnitzler, born in 1944 in Berkeley, California, who moved to Vienna with his parents in 1959.

==Literary works==
Schnitzler&#x27;s works were often controversial, both for their frank description of sexuality (in a letter to Schnitzler Sigmund Freud confessed &quot;I have gained the impression that you have learned through intuition – although actually as a result of sensitive introspection – everything that I have had to unearth by laborious work on other persons&quot;) and for their strong stand against antisemitism, represented by works such as his play &quot;Professor Bernhardi&quot; and his novel &quot;Der Weg ins Freie&quot;. However, although Schnitzler was Jewish, Professor Bernhardi and Fräulein Else are among the few clearly identified Jewish protagonists in his work.

Schnitzler was branded as a pornographer after the release of his play &quot;Reigen&quot;, in which 10 pairs of characters are shown before and after the sexual act, leading and ending with a prostitute. The furor after this play was couched in the strongest antisemitic terms. &quot;Reigen&quot; was made into a French language film in 1950 by the German-born director Max Ophüls as &quot;La Ronde&quot;. The film achieved considerable success in the English-speaking world, with the result that Schnitzler&#x27;s play is better known there under its French title. Richard Oswald&#x27;s film &quot;The Merry-Go-Round&quot; (1920), Roger Vadim&#x27;s &quot;Circle of Love&quot; (1964) and Otto Schenk&#x27;s &quot;Der Reigen&quot; (1973) also are based on the play. A more recent adaptation is the Fernando Meirelles&#x27; film &quot;360&quot;.

In the novella &quot;Fräulein Else&quot; (1924) Schnitzler may be rebutting a contentious critique of the Jewish character by Otto Weininger (1903) by positioning the sexuality of the young female Jewish protagonist. The story, a first-person stream of consciousness narrative by a young aristocratic woman, reveals a moral dilemma that ends in tragedy.

In response to an interviewer who asked Schnitzler what he thought about the critical view that his works all seemed to treat the same subjects, he replied &quot;I write of love and death. What other subjects are there?&quot; Despite his seriousness of purpose, Schnitzler frequently approaches the bedroom farce in his plays (and had an affair with Adele Sandrock, one of his actresses). &quot;Professor Bernhardi&quot;, a play about a Jewish doctor who turns away a Catholic priest in order to spare a patient the realization that she is on the point of death, is his only major dramatic work without a sexual theme.

A member of the avant-garde group Young Vienna (&quot;Jung-Wien&quot;), Schnitzler toyed with formal as well as social conventions. With his 1900 novella &quot;Leutnant Gustl&quot;, he was the first to write German fiction in stream-of-consciousness narration. The story is an unflattering portrait of its protagonist and of the army&#x27;s obsessive code of formal honor. It caused Schnitzler to be stripped of his commission as a reserve officer in the medical corps – something that should be seen in the context of the rising tide of antisemitism of the time.

He specialized in shorter works like novellas and one-act plays. And in his short stories like &quot;The Green Tie&quot; (&quot;Die grüne Krawatte&quot;) he showed himself to be one of the early masters of microfiction. However he also wrote two full-length novels: &quot;Der Weg ins Freie&quot; about a talented but not very motivated young composer, a brilliant description of a segment of pre-World War I Viennese society; and the artistically less satisfactory &quot;Therese&quot;.

In addition to his plays and fiction, Schnitzler meticulously kept a diary from the age of 17 until two days before his death. The manuscript, which runs to almost 8,000 pages, is most notable for Schnitzler&#x27;s casual descriptions of sexual conquests; he was often in relationships with several women at once (most of his liaisons occurred with an embroiderer named “Jeanette”) and for a period of some years he kept a record of every orgasm. Collections of Schnitzler&#x27;s letters also have been published.

Schnitzler&#x27;s works were called &quot;Jewish filth&quot; by Adolf Hitler and were banned by the Nazis in Austria and Germany. In 1933, when Joseph Goebbels organized book burnings in Berlin and other cities, Schnitzler&#x27;s works were thrown into flames along with those of other Jews, including Einstein, Marx, Kafka, Freud and Stefan Zweig.

His novella &quot;Fräulein Else&quot; has been adapted a number of times, including the German silent film &quot;Fräulein Else&quot; (1929), starring Elisabeth Bergner, and the 1946 Argentine film &quot;The Naked Angel&quot;, starring Olga Zubarry.

== Archive ==

The majority of Schnitzler&#x27;s archive, which consists of 40,000 pages worth of documents, was saved from the Nazis by a British man, Eric A. Blackall. Acting at the behest of Schnitzler&#x27;s widow (actually his ex-wife), Olga, Blackhall arranged for the documents to be secretly transported to Cambridge University under a diplomatic seal. 
After the war, this created a tricky legal situation, as Schnitzler&#x27;s ex-wife, Olga did not have the legal right to donate the documents. In fact, Schnitzler had bequeathed them to his son, Heinrich, who was not in Vienna at the time. 
During the Second World War and afterwards, Heinrich Schnitzler tried to get the documents back but did not succeed. Thomas Trenkler wrote in the newspaper &quot;Kurier&quot; that the acquisition of the documents by the British was not legitimate and that the documents should be handed to Schnitzler&#x27;s remaining family in 2015. Schnitzler&#x27;s grandsons, Michael and Peter, announced that they indeed wanted the documents handed over to them.

<text>A big band or jazz orchestra is a type of musical ensemble of jazz music that usually consists of ten or more musicians with four sections: saxophones, trumpets, trombones, and a rhythm section. Big bands originated during the early 1910s and dominated jazz in the early 1940s when swing was most popular. The term &quot;big band&quot; is also used to describe a genre of music, although this was not the only style of music played by big bands.

Big bands started as accompaniment for dancing the Lindy Hop. In contrast to the typical jazz emphasis on improvisation, big bands relied on written compositions and arrangements. They gave a greater role to bandleaders, arrangers, and sections of instruments rather than soloists.

==Instruments==

Big bands generally have four sections: trumpets, trombones, saxophones, and a rhythm section of guitar, piano, double bass, drums and sometimes vibraphone. The division in early big bands, from the 1920s to 1930s, was typically two or three trumpets, one or two trombones, three or four saxophones, and a rhythm section of four instruments. In the 1940s, Stan Kenton&#x27;s band used up to five trumpets, five trombones (three tenor and two bass trombones), five saxophones (two alto saxophones, two tenor saxophones, one baritone saxophone), and a rhythm section. Duke Ellington at one time used six trumpets. While most big bands dropped the previously common jazz clarinet from their arrangements (other than the clarinet-led orchestras of Artie Shaw and Benny Goodman), many Duke Ellington songs had clarinet parts, often replacing or doubling one of the tenor saxophone parts; more rarely, Ellington would substitute baritone sax for bass clarinet, such as in &quot;Ase&#x27;s Death&quot; from Swinging Suites. Boyd Raeburn drew from symphony orchestras by adding flute, French horn, strings, and timpani to his band. In the late 1930s, Shep Fields incorporated a solo accordion, temple blocks, piccolo, violins and a viola into his Rippling Rhythm Orchestra. Paul Whiteman also featured a solo accordion in his ensemble.

Jazz ensembles numbering eight (octet), nine (nonet) or ten (tentet) voices are sometimes called &quot;little big bands&quot;. During the 1940s, somewhat smaller configurations of the big band emerged in the form of the &quot;rhythm sextet&quot;. These ensembles typically featured three or more accordions accompanied by piano, guitar, bass, cello, percussion, and marimba with vibes and were popularized by recording artists such as Charles Magnante, Joe Biviano and John Serry.

Twenty-first century big bands can be considerably larger than their predecessors, exceeding 20 players, with some European bands using 29 instruments and some reaching 50.

==Seating and arrangements==
In the most common seating for a 17-piece big band, each section is carefully set-up in a way to optimize the bands sound. For the wind players, there are 3 different types of parts: lead parts (including first trumpet, first trombone, and first alto sax), solo parts (including second or fourth trumpet, second trombone, and the first tenor sax), and section members (which include the rest of the band). The band is generally configured so lead parts are seated in the middle of their sections and solo parts are seated closest to the rhythm section. The fourth trombone part is generally played by a bass trombone. In some pieces the trumpets may double on flugelhorn or cornet, and saxophone players frequently double on other woodwinds such as flute, piccolo, clarinet, bass clarinet, or soprano saxophone.

It is useful to distinguish between the roles of composer, arranger and leader. The composer writes original music that will be performed by individuals or groups of various sizes, while the arranger adapts the work of composers in a creative way for a performance or recording. Arrangers frequently notate all or most of the score of a given number, usually referred to as a &quot;chart&quot;. Bandleaders are typically performers who assemble musicians to form an ensemble of various sizes, select or create material for them, shape the music&#x27;s dynamics, phrasing, and expression in rehearsals, and lead the group in performance often while playing alongside them. One of the first prominent big band arrangers was Ferde Grofé, who was hired by Paul Whiteman to write for his “symphonic jazz orchestra”. A number of bandleaders established long-term relationships with certain arrangers, such as the collaboration between leader Count Basie and arranger Neil Hefti. Some bandleaders, such as Guy Lombardo, performed works composed by others (in Lombardo&#x27;s case, often by his brother Carmen), while others, such as Maria Schneider, take on all three roles. In many cases, however, the distinction between these roles can become blurred. Billy Strayhorn, for example, was a prolific composer and arranger, frequently collaborating with Duke Ellington, but rarely took on the role of bandleader, which was assumed by Ellington, who himself was a composer and arranger.
Typical big band arrangements from the swing era were written in strophic form with the same phrase and chord structure repeated several times. Each iteration, or chorus, commonly follows twelve bar blues form or thirty-two-bar (AABA) song form. The first chorus of an arrangement introduces the melody and is followed by choruses of development. This development may take the form of improvised solos, written solo sections, and &quot;shout choruses&quot;.

An arrangement&#x27;s first chorus is sometimes preceded by an introduction, which may be as short as a few measures or may extend to a chorus of its own. Many arrangements contain an interlude, often similar in content to the introduction, inserted between some or all choruses. Other methods of embellishing the form include modulations and cadential extensions.

Some big ensembles, like King Oliver&#x27;s, played music that was half-arranged, half-improvised, often relying on head arrangements. A head arrangement is a piece of music that is formed by band members during rehearsal. They experiment, often with one player coming up with a simple musical figure leading to development within the same section and then further expansion by other sections, with the entire band then memorizing the way they are going to perform the piece, without writing it on sheet music. During the 1930s, Count Basie&#x27;s band often used head arrangements, as Basie said, &quot;we just sort of start it off and the others fall in.&quot; Head arrangements were more common during the period of the 1930s because there was less turnover in personnel, giving the band members more time to rehearse.

==History==
===Dance music===
Before 1910, social dance in America was dominated by steps such as the waltz and polka. As jazz migrated from its New Orleans origin to Chicago and New York City, energetic, suggestive dances traveled with it. During the next decades, ballrooms filled with people doing the jitterbug and Lindy Hop. The dance duo Vernon and Irene Castle popularized the foxtrot while accompanied by the Europe Society Orchestra led by James Reese Europe.

One of the first bands to accompany the new rhythms was led by a drummer, Art Hickman, in San Francisco in 1916. Hickman&#x27;s arranger, Ferde Grofé, wrote arrangements in which he divided the jazz orchestra into sections that combined in various ways. This intermingling of sections became a defining characteristic of big bands. In 1919, Paul Whiteman hired Grofé to use similar techniques for his band. Whiteman was educated in classical music, and he called his new band&#x27;s music symphonic jazz. The methods of dance bands marked a step away from New Orleans jazz. With the exception of Jelly Roll Morton, who continued playing in the New Orleans style, bandleaders paid attention to the demand for dance music and created their own big bands. They incorporated elements of Broadway, Tin Pan Alley, ragtime, and vaudeville.

Duke Ellington led his band at the Cotton Club in Harlem. Fletcher Henderson&#x27;s career started when he was persuaded to audition for a job at Club Alabam in New York City, which eventually turned into a job as bandleader at the Roseland Ballroom. At these venues, which themselves gained notoriety, bandleaders and arrangers played a greater role than they had before. Hickman relied on Ferde Grofé, Whiteman on Bill Challis. Henderson and arranger Don Redman followed the template of King Oliver, but as the 1920s progressed they moved away from the New Orleans format and transformed jazz. They were assisted by a band full of talent: Coleman Hawkins on tenor saxophone, Louis Armstrong on cornet, and multi-instrumentalist Benny Carter, whose career lasted into the 1990s.

===The swing era===

Swing music began appearing in the early 1930s and was distinguished by a more supple feel than the more literal  of early jazz. Walter Page is often credited with developing the walking bass, although earlier examples exist, such as Wellman Braud on Ellington&#x27;s &quot;Washington Wabble&quot; (1927).

This type of music flourished through the early 1930s, although there was little mass audience for it until around 1936. Up until that time, it was viewed with ridicule and sometimes looked upon as a menace. After 1935, big bands rose to prominence playing swing music and held a major role in defining swing as a distinctive style. Western swing musicians also formed popular big bands during the same period.

A considerable range of styles evolved among the hundreds of popular bands. Many of the better known bands reflected the individuality of the bandleader, the lead arranger, and the personnel. Count Basie played a relaxed, propulsive swing, Bob Crosby (brother of Bing), more of a dixieland style, Benny Goodman a hard driving swing, and Duke Ellington&#x27;s compositions were varied and sophisticated. Many bands featured strong instrumentalists whose sounds dominated, such as the clarinets of Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw, the trombone of Jack Teagarden, the trumpet of Harry James, the drums of Gene Krupa, and the vibes of Lionel Hampton.

The popularity of many of the major bands was amplified by star vocalists, such as Frank Sinatra and Connie Haines with Tommy Dorsey, Helen O&#x27;Connell and Bob Eberly with Jimmy Dorsey, Ella Fitzgerald with Chick Webb, Billie Holiday and Jimmy Rushing with Count Basie, Kay Starr with Charlie Barnet, Bea Wain with Larry Clinton, Dick Haymes, Kitty Kallen and Helen Forrest with Harry James, Fran Warren with Claude Thornhill, Doris Day with Les Brown, and Peggy Lee and Martha Tilton with Benny Goodman. Some bands were &quot;society bands&quot; which relied on strong ensembles, such as the bands of Guy Lombardo and Paul Whiteman.

A distinction is often made between so-called &quot;hard bands&quot;, such as those of Count Basie and Tommy Dorsey, which emphasized quick hard-driving jump tunes, and &quot;sweet bands&quot;, such as the Glenn Miller Orchestra and the Shep Fields Rippling Rhythm Orchestra who specialized in less improvised tunes with more emphasis on sentimentality, featuring somewhat slower-paced, often heart-felt songs.

By this time the big band was such a dominant force in jazz that the older generation found they either had to adapt to it or simply retire. With no market for small-group recordings (made worse by a Depression-era industry reluctant to take risks), musicians such as Louis Armstrong and Earl Hines led their own bands, while others, like Jelly Roll Morton and King Oliver, lapsed into obscurity. Even so, many of the most popular big bands of the swing era cultivated small groups within the larger ensemble: e.g. Benny Goodman developed both a trio and a quartet, Artie Shaw formed the Gramercy Five, Count Basie developed the Kansas City Six and Tommy Dorsey the Clambake Seven.

The major &quot;black&quot; bands of the 1930s included, apart from Ellington&#x27;s, Hines&#x27;s, and Calloway&#x27;s, those of Jimmie Lunceford, Chick Webb, and Count Basie. The &quot;white&quot; bands of Benny Goodman, Artie Shaw, Tommy Dorsey, Shep Fields and, later, Glenn Miller were more popular than their &quot;black&quot; counterparts from the middle of the decade. Bridging the gap to white audiences in the mid-1930s was the Casa Loma Orchestra and Benny Goodman&#x27;s early band. The contrast in commercial popularity between &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; bands was striking: between 1935 and 1945 the top four &quot;white&quot; bands had 292 top ten records, of which 65 were number one hits, while the top four &quot;black&quot; bands had only 32 top ten hits, with only three reaching number one.

White teenagers and young adults were the principal fans of the big bands in the late 1930s and early 1940s. They danced to recordings and the radio and attended live concerts. They were knowledgeable and often biased toward their favorite bands and songs, and sometimes worshipful of famous soloists and vocalists. Many bands toured the country in grueling one-night stands. Traveling conditions and lodging were difficult, in part due to segregation in most parts of the United States, and the personnel often had to perform having had little sleep and food. Apart from the star soloists, many musicians received low wages and would abandon the tour if bookings disappeared. Sometimes bandstands were too small, public address systems inadequate, pianos out of tune. Bandleaders dealt with these obstacles through rigid discipline (Glenn Miller) and canny psychology (Duke Ellington).

Big bands raised morale during World War II. Many musicians served in the military and toured with USO troupes at the front, with Glenn Miller losing his life while traveling between shows. Many bands suffered from loss of personnel during the war years, and, as a result, women replaced men who had been inducted, while all-female bands began to appear. The 1942–44 musicians&#x27; strike worsened the situation. Vocalists began to strike out on their own. By the end of the war, swing was giving way to less danceable music, such as bebop. Many of the great swing bands broke up, as the times and tastes changed.

Many bands from the swing era continued for decades after the death or departure of their founders and namesakes, and some are still active in the 21st century, often referred to as &quot;ghost bands&quot;, a term attributed to Woody Herman, referring to orchestras that persist in the absence of their original leaders.

===Modern big bands===

Although big bands are identified with the swing era, they continued to exist after those decades, though the music they played was often different from swing. Bandleader Charlie Barnet&#x27;s recording of &quot;Cherokee&quot; in 1942 and &quot;The Moose&quot; in 1943 have been called the beginning of the bop era. Woody Herman&#x27;s first band, nicknamed the First Herd, borrowed from progressive jazz, while the Second Herd emphasized the saxophone section of three tenors and one baritone. In the 1950s, Stan Kenton referred to his band&#x27;s music as &quot;progressive jazz&quot;, &quot;modern&quot;, and &quot;new music&quot;. He created his band as a vehicle for his compositions. Kenton pushed the boundaries of big bands by combining clashing elements and by hiring arrangers whose ideas about music conflicted. This expansive eclecticism characterized much of jazz after World War II. During the 1960s and &#x27;70s, Sun Ra and his Arketstra took big bands further out. Ra&#x27;s eclectic music was played by a roster of musicians from ten to thirty and was presented as theater, with costumes, dancers, and special effects.

As jazz was expanded during the 1950s through the 1970s, the Basie and Ellington bands were still around, as were bands led by Buddy Rich, Gene Krupa, Lionel Hampton, Earl Hines, Les Brown, Clark Terry, and Doc Severinsen. Progressive bands were led by Dizzy Gillespie, Gil Evans, Carla Bley, Toshiko Akiyoshi and Lew Tabackin, Don Ellis, and Anthony Braxton.

In the 1960s and 1970s, big band rock became popular by integrating such musical ingredients as progressive rock experimentation, jazz fusion, and the horn choirs often used in blues and soul music, with some of the most prominent groups including Chicago; Blood, Sweat and Tears; Tower of Power; and, from Canada, Lighthouse. The genre was gradually absorbed into mainstream pop rock and the jazz rock sector.

Other bandleaders used Brazilian and Afro-Cuban music with big band instrumentation, and big bands led by arranger Gil Evans, saxophonist John Coltrane (on the album &quot;Ascension&quot; from 1965) and bass guitarist Jaco Pastorius introduced cool jazz, free jazz and jazz fusion, respectively, to the big band domain. Modern big bands can be found playing all styles of jazz music. Some large contemporary European jazz ensembles play mostly avant-garde jazz using the instrumentation of the big bands. Examples include the Vienna Art Orchestra, founded in 1977, and the Italian Instabile Orchestra, active in the 1990s.
In the late 1990s, there was a swing revival in the U.S. The Lindy Hop became popular again and young people took an interest in big band styles again.

Big bands maintained a presence on American television, particularly through the late-night talk show, which has historically used big bands as house accompaniment. Typically the most prominent shows with the earliest time slots and largest audiences have bigger bands with horn sections while those in later time slots go with smaller, leaner ensembles.

Many college and university music departments offer jazz programs and feature big band courses in improvisation, composition, arranging, and studio recording, featuring performances by 18 to 20 piece big bands.

==Radio==

During the 1930s, Earl Hines and his band broadcast from the Grand Terrace in Chicago every night across America. In Kansas City and across the Southwest, an earthier, bluesier style was developed by such bandleaders as Bennie Moten and, later, by Jay McShann and Jesse Stone. By 1937, the &quot;sweet jazz band&quot; saxophonist Shep Fields was also featured over the airways on the NBC radio network in his &quot;Rippling Rhythm Revue,&quot; which also showcased a young Bob Hope as the announcer.

Big band remotes on the major radio networks spread the music from ballrooms and clubs across the country during the 1930s and 1940s, with remote broadcasts from jazz clubs continuing into the 1950s on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Monitor&quot;. Radio increased the fame of Benny Goodman, the &quot;Pied Piper of Swing&quot;. Others challenged him, and battle of the bands became a regular feature of theater performances.

Similarly, Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians Orchestra also achieved widespread notoriety for nearly half a century as a result of their broadcasts on the NBC and CBS networks of the annual New Year&#x27;s Eve celebrations from the Roosevelt Grill at New York&#x27;s Roosevelt Hotel (1929-1959) and the Ballroom at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel (1959-1976) .

Gloria Parker had a radio program on which she conducted the largest all-girl orchestra led by a female. She led her Swingphony while playing marimba. Phil Spitalny, a native of Ukraine, led a 22-piece female orchestra known as Phil Spitalny and His Hour of Charm Orchestra, named for his radio show, &quot;The Hour of Charm&quot;, during the 1930s and 1940s. Other female bands were led by trumpeter B. A. Rolfe, Anna Mae Winburn, and Ina Ray Hutton.

==Movies==
Big Bands began to appear in movies in the 1930s through the 1960s, though cameos by bandleaders were often stiff and incidental to the plot.Shep Fields appeared with his Rippling Rhythm Orchestra in a playful and integrated animated performance of &quot;This Little Ripple Had Rhythm&quot; in the musical extravaganza &quot;The Big Broadcast of 1938&quot;. Fictionalized biographical films of Glenn Miller, Gene Krupa, and Benny Goodman were made in the 1950s.

The bands led by Helen Lewis, Ben Bernie, and Roger Wolfe Kahn&#x27;s band were filmed by Lee de Forest in his Phonofilm sound-on-film process in 1925, in three short films which are in the Library of Congress film collection.

<text>Haarlem (; predecessor of &quot;Harlem&quot; in English) is a city and municipality in the Netherlands. It is the capital of the province of North Holland. Haarlem is situated at the northern edge of the Randstad, one of the more populated metropolitan areas in Europe; it is also part of the Amsterdam metropolitan area. Haarlem had a population of in .

Haarlem was granted city status or in 1245, although the first city walls were not built until 1270. The modern city encompasses the former municipality of Schoten as well as parts that previously belonged to Bloemendaal and Heemstede. Apart from the city, the municipality of Haarlem also includes the western part of the village of Spaarndam. Newer sections of Spaarndam lie within the neighbouring municipality of Haarlemmermeer.

==Geography==

Haarlem is located on the river Spaarne, giving it its nickname Spaarnestad (Spaarne city). It is situated about west of Amsterdam and near the coastal dunes. Haarlem has been the historical centre of the tulip bulb-growing district for centuries and bears its other nickname Bloemenstad (flower city) for this reason.

==History==

Haarlem has a rich history dating back to pre-medieval times, as it lies on a thin strip of land above sea level known as the strandwal (beach ridge), which connects Leiden to Alkmaar. The people on this narrow strip of land struggled against the waters of the North Sea from the west, and the waters of the IJ and the Haarlem Lake from the east. Haarlem became wealthy with toll revenues that it collected from ships and travellers moving on this busy north–south route. 

As shipping became increasingly important economically, the city of Amsterdam became the main Dutch city of North Holland during the Dutch Golden Age. The town of Halfweg became a suburb, and Haarlem became a quiet bedroom community, and for this reason Haarlem still has many of its central medieval buildings intact. Many of them are now on the Dutch Heritage register known as Rijksmonuments. The list of Rijksmonuments in Haarlem gives an overview of these per neighbourhood, with the majority in the old city centre.

===Middle Ages===
The oldest mention of Haarlem dates from the 10th century. The name probably comes from &quot;Haarlo-heim&quot;. This name is composed of three elements: &quot;haar&quot;, &quot;lo&quot; and &quot;heim&quot;. In Old Dutch toponyms &quot;lo&quot; always refers to &#x27;forest&#x27; and &quot;heim&quot; (&quot;heem&quot;, &quot;em&quot; or &quot;um&quot;) to &#x27;home&#x27; or &#x27;house&#x27;. &quot;Haar&quot;, however, has several meanings, one of them corresponding with the location of Haarlem on a sand dune: &#x27;elevated place&#x27;. The name Haarlem or Haarloheim would therefore mean &#x27;home on a forested dune&#x27;.

There was a stream called &quot;De Beek&quot;, dug from the peat grounds west of the river Spaarne as a drainage canal. Over the centuries the Beek was turned into an underground canal, as the city grew larger and the space was needed for construction. Over time it began to silt up and in the 19th century it was filled in. The village had a good location: by the river Spaarne, and by a major road going south to north. By the 12th century it was a fortified town, and Haarlem became the residence of the Counts of Holland.

In 1219 the knights of Haarlem were laurelled by Count Willem I, because they had conquered the Egyptian port of Damietta (or Damiate in Dutch, present-day Dimyat) in the fifth crusade. Haarlem received the right to bear the Count&#x27;s sword and cross in its coat of arms. On 23 November 1245 Count Willem II granted Haarlem city rights. This implied a number of privileges, among which the right for the sheriff and magistrates to administer justice, instead of the Count. This allowed for a quicker and more efficient judiciary system, more suited to the needs of the growing city.

After a siege from the surrounding area of Kennemerland in 1270 a defensive wall was built around the city. Most likely this was an earthen wall with wooden gates. Originally the city started out between Spaarne, Oudegracht, Ridderstraat, Bakenessergracht and Nassaustraat. In the 14th century the city expanded, and the Burgwalbuurt, Bakenes and the area around the Oudegracht became part of the city. The old defenses proved not to be sufficiently strong for the expanded city, and at the end of the 14th century a 16½-metre high wall was built, complete with a 15-metre wide canal circling the city. In 1304 the Flemish threatened the city, but they were defeated by Witte van Haemstede at Manpad.

All the city&#x27;s buildings were made of wood, and fire was a great risk. In 1328 nearly the whole city burnt down. The Sint-Bavokerk was severely damaged, and rebuilding it would take more than 150 years. Again on 12 June 1347 there was a fire in the city. A third large fire, in 1351, destroyed many buildings including the Count&#x27;s castle and the city hall. The Count did not need a castle in Haarlem because his castle in The Hague (Den Haag) had taken over all functions. 

The count donated the ground to the city and later a new city hall was built there. The shape of the old city was square—this was inspired by the shape of ancient Jerusalem. After every fire the city was rebuilt quickly, an indication of the wealth of the city in those years. The Black Death came to the city in 1381. According to an estimate by a priest from Leiden the disease killed 5,000 people, about half the population at that time.

In the 14th century, Haarlem was a major city. It was the second largest city in historical Holland after Dordrecht and before Delft, Leiden, Amsterdam, Gouda and Rotterdam. In 1429 the city gained the right to collect tolls, including ships passing the city on the Spaarne river. At the end of the Middle Ages, Haarlem was a flourishing city with a large textile industry, shipyards and beer breweries. Around 1428, the city was put under siege by the army of Jacqueline, Countess of Hainaut. Haarlem had taken side with the Cods in the Hook and Cod wars and thus against Jacoba of Bavaria. The entire Haarlemmerhout wood was burnt down by the enemy.

===Spanish siege===


When the city of Brielle was conquered by the Geuzen revolutionary army, the municipality of Haarlem started supporting the Geuzen. King Philip II of Spain was not pleased, and sent an army north under the command of Don Fadrique (Don Frederick in Dutch), son of Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba. On 17 November 1572 all citizens of the city of Zutphen were killed by the Spanish army, and on 1 December the city of Naarden suffered the same fate.

On 11 December 1572 the Spanish army besieged Haarlem; the city&#x27;s defenses were commanded by city-governor Wigbolt Ripperda. Kenau Simonsdochter Hasselaer, a powerful widow, helped defend the city together with some three hundred other women.

During the first two months of the siege, the situation was in balance. The Spanish army was digging tunnels to reach the city walls and blow them up; the defenders dug in turn and undermined the Spaniards&#x27; tunnels. The situation worsened on 29 March 1573: the Amsterdam army, faithful to the Spanish king, controlled Haarlemmermeer lake, effectively blocking Haarlem from the outside world. An attempt by the Prince of Orange to destroy the Spanish navy on the Haarlemmermeer had failed. Hunger in the city grew, and the situation became so tense that on 27 May many (Spanish-loyal) prisoners were taken from the prison and murdered; the Spaniards had previously gibbeted their own prisoners of war.

In the beginning of July the Prince of Orange assembled an army of 5,000 soldiers near Leiden to free Haarlem. However, he was prevented from accompanying them in person and the Spanish forces trapped them at the Manpad where they were decisively defeated. On 13 July 1573, after seven months of siege, the city surrendered. Many defenders were slaughtered; some were drowned in the Spaarne river. Governor Ripperda and his lieutenant were beheaded. The citizens were allowed to buy freedom for themselves and the city for 240,000 guilders and the city was required to host a Spanish garrison. Don Fadrique thanked God for his victory in the Sint-Bavo Church. However, the terms of the treaty were not kept, with the Spanish soldiery plundering the townspeople&#x27;s property.

Despite Haarlem&#x27;s ultimate fall, the fact that the Haarlemers had been able to stand for seven months against the whole Spanish array inspired the rest of Holland to resist the invaders, and their prolonged resistance allowed the Prince of Orange to prepare and arm the rest of the country for war. Some 12,000 of the Spanish army had fallen during the siege.

===Great fire===
The city suffered a large fire in the night from 22 to 23 October 1576. The fire started in brewery het Ankertje, near the weighhouse at the Spaarne, which was used by mercenaries as a guarding place. When they were warming themselves at a fire it got out of control. The fire was spotted by farmers, who sailed their ships on the river. However, the soldiers turned down all help, saying that they would put out the fire themselves. 

This failed, and the fire destroyed almost 500 buildings, among them St-Gangolf&#x27;s church and St-Elisabeth&#x27;s hospital. Most of the mercenaries were later arrested, and one of them was hanged on the Grote Markt in front of a large audience. Maps from that era clearly show the damage done by the fire: a wide strip through the city was destroyed. The combined result of the siege and the fire was that about a third of the city was destroyed.

===Golden age===
The fire and the long siege had taken their toll on the city. The Spanish left in 1577 and under the Agreement of Veere, Protestants and Catholics were given equal rights, though in government the Protestants clearly had the upper hand and Catholic possessions once seized were never returned. To restore the economy and attract workers for the brewing and bleaching businesses (Haarlem was known for these, thanks to the clean water from the dunes), the Haarlem council decided to promote the pursuit of arts and history, showing tolerance for diversity among religious beliefs. 

This attracted a large influx of Flemish and French immigrants (Catholics and Huguenots alike) who were fleeing the Spanish occupation of their own cities. Expansion plans soon replaced plans of rebuilding the destroyed city walls. Just like the rest of the country, the Golden Age in the United Provinces had started.

====Linen and silk====

The new citizens had a lot of expertise in linen and silk manufacture and trading, and the city&#x27;s population grew from 18,000 in 1573 to around 40,000 in 1622. At one point, in 1621, over 50% of the population was Flemish-born. Haarlem&#x27;s linen became notable and the city flourished. Today an impression of some of those original textile tradesmen can be had from the Book of Trades document created by Jan Luyken and his son.

====Infrastructure====
In 1632 a tow canal between Haarlem and Amsterdam, the Haarlemmertrekvaart was opened, the first tow canal in the country. The empty areas in the city that were a result of the fire of 1576 were filled with new houses and buildings. Even outside the city wall buildings were constructed—in 1643 about 400 houses were counted outside the wall. 

Having buildings outside the city walls was not a desirable situation to the city administration. Not only because these buildings would be vulnerable in case of an attack on the city, but there was also less control over taxes and city regulations outside the walls. Therefore, a major project was initiated in 1671: expanding the city northwards. 

Two new canals were dug, and a new defensive wall was constructed (the current Staten en Prinsenbolwerk). Two old city gates, the Janspoort and Kruispoort, were demolished. The idea that a city had to be square-shaped was abandoned.

====Cultural life====
After the fall of Antwerp, many artists and craftsmen migrated to Haarlem and received commissions from the Haarlem council to decorate the city hall. The paintings commissioned were meant to show Haarlem&#x27;s glorious history as well as Haarlem&#x27;s glorious products. Haarlem&#x27;s cultural life prospered, with painters like Frans Hals and Jacob van Ruisdael, the architect Lieven de Key and Jan Steen who made many paintings in Haarlem. 

The Haarlem councilmen became quite creative in their propaganda promoting their city. On the Grote Markt, the central market square, there&#x27;s a statue of Laurens Janszoon Coster who is allegedly the inventor of the printing press. This is the second and larger statue to him on the square. The original stands behind the city hall in the little garden known as the Hortus (where today the Stedelijk Gymnasium school is located). 

Most scholars agree that the scarce evidence seems to point to Johann Gutenberg as the first European inventor of the printing press, but Haarlem children were taught about &quot;Lau&quot;, as he is known, well into the 20th century. This legend served the printers of Haarlem well, however, and it is probably for that reason the most notable Dutch history books from the Dutch Golden Age period were published in Haarlem; by Hadrianus Junius (Batavia), Dirck Volkertszoon Coornhert (Works), Karel van Mander (Schilderboeck), Samuel Ampzing (Description and Ode to Haarlem), Petrus Scriverius (Batavia Illustrata), and Pieter Christiaenszoon Bor (Origin of the Dutch wars).

====Beer brewing====
Beer brewing was a very important industry in Haarlem. Until the 16th century, the water for the beer was taken from the canals in the city. These canals were connected to seawater, via the Spaarne and the IJ. However, the canal water was getting more and more polluted and less suitable for brewing beer. A place south-west of the city was then used to take fresh water in. 

However, the quality of that water was not good enough either. From the 17th century, a canal (Santvaert) was used to transport water from the dunes to the city. The water was transported in barrels on ships. The location where the water was taken is called the Brouwerskolkje, and the canal to there still exists, and is now called the Brewers&#x27; Canal (Brouwersvaart).

Haarlem was a major beer producer in the Netherlands. The majority of the beer it produced was consumed in North Holland. During the Spanish siege, there were about 50 breweries in the city. In 1620, the city had about one hundred breweries.

There was another epidemic of the Black Death in 1657, which took a heavy toll in the six months it ravaged the city. From the end of the 17th century, the economy in the city worsened for a long time. In 1752, only seven breweries remained, and by 1820 no breweries were registered in the city. In the 1990s, the Stichting Haarlems Biergenootschap revived some old recipes under the Jopen beer brand that is marketed as a &quot;Haarlem bier.&quot; In 2010, Jopen opened a brewery in a former church in central Haarlem called the Jopenkerk. In 2012, Haarlem gained another local brewery with Uiltje Brewing in the Zijlstraat, which specializes in craft beer.

====Tulip centre====
Since the 1630s, Haarlem has been a major trading centre for tulips, and it was at the epicentre during tulip mania, when outrageous prices were paid for tulip bulbs. From the opening of the Leiden-Haarlem canal Leidsevaart in 1656, it became popular to travel from Rotterdam to Amsterdam by passenger boat rather than by coach. The canals were dug for passenger service only, and were comfortable though slow. The towpath led these passengers through the bulb fields south of Haarlem. 

Haarlem was an important stopover for passengers from the last half of the 17th century and through the 18th century until the building of the first rail tracks along the routes of former passenger canal systems. As Haarlem slowly expanded southwards, so did the bulb fields. Today, rail passengers between Rotterdam and Amsterdam in spring can see blooming bulb fields on the route between Leiden and Haarlem.

===18th century===

As the centre of trade gravitated towards Amsterdam, Haarlem declined in the 18th century. The Golden Age had created a large upper middle class of merchants and well-to-do small business owners. Taking advantage of the reliability of the trekschuit connection between Amsterdam and Haarlem, many people had a business address in Amsterdam and a weekend or summer home in Haarlem. 

Haarlem became more and more a bedroom community as the increasingly dense population of Amsterdam caused the canals to smell in the summer. Many well-to-do gentlemen moved their families to summer homes in the Spring and commuted between addresses. Popular places for summer homes were along the Spaarne in southern Haarlem. Pieter Teyler van der Hulst and Henry Hope built summer homes there, as well as many Amsterdam merchants and councilmen. Today, boat travel along the Spaarne is still possible and has become a popular form of tourism in the summer. In the 18th century, Haarlem became the seat of a suffragan diocese of the Old Catholic Church of Utrecht.


===French rule===
At the end of the 18th century, a number of anti-Orange commissions were founded. On 18 January 1795 the &quot;Staatse&quot; army was defeated near Woerden. During the night preceding 19 January, the same night that stadtholder William V of Orange fled the country, the various commissions gathered and implemented a revolution. The commissions changed the city&#x27;s administrators in a bloodless revolution, and the next morning the city was &quot;liberated&quot; of the tyranny of the House of Orange. The revolution was peaceful, and the Orange-loyal people were not harmed. The Batavian Republic was then proclaimed.

The French army entered the liberated city two days later, on 20 January. An army of 1,500 soldiers was provided with food and clothing by the citizens. The new national government was strongly centralised, and the role and influence of the cities was reduced. The Batavian Republic signed a mutual defense pact with France and was thus automatically at war with England. The strong English presence at sea severely reduced trading opportunities, and the Dutch economy suffered accordingly.

===19th century===
The textile industry, which had always been an important pillar of Haarlem&#x27;s economy, was suffering at the beginning of the 19th century. Strong international competition and revolutionary new production methods based on steam engines already in use in England dealt a striking blow to Haarlem&#x27;s industry. In 1815, the city&#x27;s population was about 17,000 people, many of whom were poor. The foundation of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in that year gave hope to many who believed that under a new government, the economy would improve and that export-oriented economic activities, such as the textile industry, would recover.

In the beginning of the 19th century, the defense walls had lost their function, and architect Zocher Jr. planned a park on the location of the former defense line. The city walls and gates were demolished, and the bricks were reused for construction of factories and workers&#x27; homes . Haarlem became the provincial capital of North Holland province in the early 19th century. 

In the mid-19th century, the city&#x27;s economy slowly started to improve. New factories opened, and a number of large industrial companies were founded in Haarlem by Thomas Wilson, Guillaume Jean Poelman, J.B.T. Prévinaire, J.J. Beijnes, Hendrik Figee, Gerardus Johannes Droste, and G.P.J. Beccari.

====Cotton mills====

The Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij (NHM or Dutch Trade Company) was founded by King Willem I to create employment opportunities. As one of the cities in the western part of the Netherlands with the worst economic situation, three cotton mills were created in Haarlem under the NHM-program in the 1830s. These were run by experts from the Southern Netherlands, whom the NHM considered better at mechanical weaving through the local expertise of Lieven Bauwens. 

The contract winners were Thomas Wilson, whose factory was situated north of what is today the Wilsonplein, Guillaume Jean Poelman, who was in business with his nephew Charles Vervaecke from Ghent and had a factory on what today is the Phoenixstraat, and Jean Baptiste Theodore Prévinaire, who had a factory on the Garenkokerskade and whose son Marie Prosper Theodore Prévinaire created the Haarlemsche Katoenmaatschappij in 1875.

These cotton factories produced goods for export, and because the Dutch government levied heavy taxes on foreign cotton producers this was a profitable business for the NHM-factories, especially for export to the Dutch East Indies. The programme started in the 1830s, and was initially successful. However, after 1839 when Belgium split away from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, the protectionist measures for the Dutch East Indian market were removed, and the business began to flounder. When the American Civil War reduced the import of raw cotton significantly after 1863, the business went sour. Only Prévinaire was able to survive through specialisation with his &quot;Turkish Red&quot; dye. The Prévinaire &quot;toile Adrinople&quot; was popular. Prévinaire&#x27;s son went on to create the Haarlemsche Katoenmaatschappij, which made a kind of imitation batik cloth called &quot;La Javanaise&quot; that became popular in Belgian Congo.

====Train and tram====
In England in 1804, Richard Trevithick designed the first locomotive. The government of the Netherlands was relatively slow to catch up, even though the king feared competition from newly established Belgium if it would construct a railway between Antwerp and other cities. The Dutch parliament balked at the high level of investment needed, but a group of private investors started the Hollandsche IJzeren Spoorweg-Maatschappij on 1 June 1836. 

It took three years to build the first track on the railway, between Haarlem and Amsterdam along the old tow canal called the Haarlemmertrekvaart. The ground there was wet and muddy. On 20 September 1839, the first train service in the Netherlands started. The train had a speed of about . The train service gave the Beijnes company, and indirectly the whole economy of Haarlem, a strong boost, and the effects of this can be seen in the Haarlem railway station, now a rijksmonument. Instead of more than two hours, Amsterdam was now only 30 minutes away. 

The old passenger service by trekschuit along the Haarlemmertrekvaart was quickly taken out of service in favour of the train service, which was quicker and more reliable. In 1878, a Beijnes-made horse tram started servicing passengers from the railway station to the Haarlemmerhout woodland park, and in 1894, the Eerste Nederlandsche Electrische Tram Maatschappij (ENET) was founded with cars built by Beijnes and became the first Dutch electric tram, which ran in Haarlem from 1899 onwards.

====Water management====
Though the old trekvaart was closed for water traffic after railway development, it is still possible to travel by boat from Amsterdam to Haarlem, via the ringvaart or the North Sea Canal. Pleasure boating in the summer has become an important Haarlem tourist attraction, though it is not possible to travel all of the original canals as in Amsterdam. The creation of new land in the Haarlemmermeer polder from 1852 onwards meant that the city could no longer refresh the water in its canals from the Spaarne river. The increase in industry worsened water quality. In 1859, the Oude Gracht canal stank so badly in the summer that it not only forced visitors away, but posed a public health threat due to cholera outbreaks. It was filled in to create a new street called the Gedempte Oude Gracht. The periodic cholera outbreaks had not been new, but they had been increasing. In 1591, the city fathers had ordered excavation to build the Verwulft, a wide bridge over the Oude Gracht connecting the north and south portions of the Grote Houtstraat. Such &quot;overclosures&quot; can still be seen in other Dutch cities, such as the Nieuwmarkt in Amsterdam.

====Expanding borders====
From 1879, the population of the city almost doubled in thirty years, from 36,976 to 69,410 in 1909. Not only did the population grow, but the city was expanding rapidly, too. The Leidsebuurt district was incorporated into Haarlem in the 1880s. A small part of the (now defunct) municipality of Schoten was incorporated in 1884 because the council of Haarlem wanted to have the hospital (Het Dolhuys) inside the municipal borders. This hospital was situated at &quot;het bolwerk&quot; on Schoten&#x27;s territory.

===Early 20th century===
In the beginning of the 20th century, the city expanded north. As early as 1905, an official plan was presented by the Haarlem municipality for expansion. However, the surrounding municipalities did not agree, and it would take 25 years to come to an agreement. On 1 May 1927, the municipality of Schoten became part of Haarlem, as well as part of Spaarndam, Bloemendaal and Heemstede. The population increased at once with 31,184 citizens.

In 1908, a renewed railway station was opened. The tracks were elevated, so traffic in the city was no longer hampered by railway crossings. In 1911, Anthony Fokker showed his plane de Spin to the audience in Haarlem by flying around the Sint-Bavokerk on Queen&#x27;s Day.

Later the expansion of the city went southwards (Schalkwijk) and eastwards (Waarderpolder). In 1932, Vroom &amp; Dreesmann, a Dutch retailer built a department store at Verwulft. Many buildings were demolished, except one small chemist&#x27;s shop on the corner, &quot;Van der Pigge&quot;, who refused to be bought out and which is now encapsulated by the V&amp;D building. They are therefore also called &quot;David and Goliath&quot; by locals.

===Haarlem in World War II===

From 17 to 21 September 1944, parts of Haarlem-Noord (north of the Jan Gijzenvaart) were evacuated by the Germans to make way for a defensive line. The stadium of HFC Haarlem, the football club, was demolished. Hundreds of people had to leave their homes and were forced to stay with other citizens.

From 22 September 1944 to the end of the war, there was gas available only two hours per day. Electricity stopped on 9 October. The German occupiers built a thick, black wall through the Haarlemmerhout (in the south of the city), as well as at the Jan Gijzenvaart in the evacuated area. The wall was called Mauer-muur and was meant to help defend the city.

In February 1944, the family of Corrie ten Boom was arrested by the Nazis; they had been hiding Jews and Dutch resistance workers from the German occupier throughout the war.

During World War II, the Dutch heroine Hannie Schaft, who worked for a Dutch resistance group, was captured and executed by the German occupation just before the end of the war in 1945. Despite her efforts and those of her colleagues and private families such as the Ten Booms, most Haarlem Jews were deported, the Haarlem Synagogue was demolished, and the Jewish hospital was annexed by the St. Elisabeth Gasthuis. Several Haarlem families, whether they were politically active in the NSB or not, suffered from random attacks, as the Haarlem writer Harry Mulisch described in his book De Aanslag. Haarlemmers survived during the Hunger Winter by eating tulip bulbs stored in sheds in the sandy fields around the city.

===Post-World War II ===
After the war, much of the large industry left the city, such as the banknote printing firm of Joh. Enschedé. The centre of industry and shipping shifted towards Amsterdam. Though the population had been decimated by starvation, a new wave of immigrants came to the city from the Dutch former colonies in Indonesia. This brought some government funding for building projects. In 1963, a large number of houses was built in Schalkwijk.

==Religion==
Haarlem has had a Christian parish church since the 9th century. This first church was a &quot;daughter church&quot; of Velsen, which itself was founded in 695 by St. Willibrord. It was a wooden church at the site of the current Grote Kerk on the Grote Markt (central market square). Haarlem was granted its first known indulgence by Clement V in 1309, during the Avignon Papacy. In 1245 Haarlem received city rights as a result of population growth and the church was expanded. Later, after the fires of 1347 and 1351, Haarlem was again granted a Portiuncula indulgence in 1397 for funding to rebuild the church. This indulgence would be used again and again over the centuries to fund expansion and restoration activities.

Having been granted papal rights from Avignon was perhaps the reason that the ties to Rome were never very strong in Haarlem, since the building most commonly called the Cathedral in the centre of town only held a cathedra for 19 years, from 1559 to 1578. This Grote Kerk or Sint-Bavokerk was originally a parish church devoted to the Virgin Mary, but was later named after the patron saint of Haarlem, Saint Bavo, who descended from Heaven regularly to free the Haarlemmers from invaders, most recently when the Kennemers and West-Friesians attacked in 1274. This is allegedly how the Haarlem war cry &quot;Sint Bavo voor Haarlem&quot; originated, which was used during the siege against the Spaniards in 1572 that eventually resulted in an underground cathedra called the Sint Josephstatie, on the Goudsmitsplein.
The Roman Catholic parish of Haarlem became a Diocese in 1559 (Dioecesis Harlemensis) and the first bishop of Haarlem was Nicolaas van Nieuwland (born in 1510). He accepted the position on 6 November 1561. In 1569 he was advised to resign by the Duke of Alva, because of his reputation for drinking (Dronken Klaasje). He had a good reason to drown his sorrows, because he feared the Catholic Spanish invaders as much as the native Dutch reformers. The Grote Kerk was initially spared from iconoclasm, because the city&#x27;s mayor ordered the closing of the church for several months in 1566. That gave the various groups in Haarlem the time to quietly remove many of the treasures from the church and stash them safely in underground chapels. All symbols and statues linked to the Roman Catholic faith were removed from the cathedral. Since many groups already had their own chapels in the Grote Kerk, this was conducted in an orderly way. However, after the siege of Haarlem was lost, the Spanish army restored Roman Catholic iconography. The guilds had to restore their old altars, at great expense. Since Haarlem was quite poor after the siege, this led to many of the chapels and other Catholic churches being abandoned and used for other purposes. The Bakenesserkerk, where 1500 soldiers were held before being killed by the Spanish after their victory, was used to store turf for fifty years.

Van Nieuwland was succeeded by Godfried van Mierlo, who was the last bishop in communion with Rome Haarlem would know for 300 years. In 1578 after the Spanish were defeated, the church was attacked on Sacrament day (29 May), this time by soldiers of the Prince of Orange. One of the priests was killed, and many objects in the church were destroyed. This event, called the Haarlemse Noon, forced the bishop to flee the city. Many treasures were still safe 500 yards away in the underground Catholic church. The city council confiscated the Sint Bavo Kerk and all of its daughter churches, and later converted them along the tenets of the Evangelical Reformed Church. The new (and current) name became Grote Kerk. Old Catholics and the Lutherans, though unofficially tolerated, went underground. Both Protestants and Catholics alike felt that when all political unrest had subsided, the Catholics could regain control of &quot;their&quot; church. However, the Dutch Protestants had also removed all Catholics from local government and feared that they would have to pay damages to the Catholics if they were allowed their own churches again. 

In the 19th century, all over the Netherlands, new Catholic churches were subsidised, called Waterboard churches, for their similarity to Waterboard pump stations (they were designed by the same architect in Neo-classical style), and in Haarlem they built the St. Joseph kerk in the Jansstraat in 1841. It was not until 1853 that a new Roman Catholic bishop was installed in the St. Joseph kerk. As this church grew, a new cathedral, again called the Cathedral of Saint Bavo, was built at the Leidsevaart (canal to Leiden) in 1898. The Bishop of Haarlem has a formal residence on the Nieuwe Gracht canal.

There is also an Old Catholic bishop of Haarlem.

There is still a small Jewish community with their own synagogue.

The Frans Hals Museum, which was the Haarlem municipal museum, has still in its collection today many pieces confiscated from the churches during the Haarlemse Noon.

There are several museums in Haarlem. The Teylers Museum lies on the Spaarne river, and it is the oldest museum of the Netherlands. Its main subjects are art, science and, natural history, and it owns a number of works by Michelangelo and Rembrandt. Another museum is the Frans Hals Museum of fine arts, with its main location housing Dutch master paintings, and its exhibition halls on the housing a gallery for modern art called De Hallen. Also on the Grote Markt, in the cellar of the Vleeshal is the Archeologisch Museum Haarlem, while across the square on Saturdays, the Hoofdwacht building is open with exhibitions on Haarlem history.

Other museums include the Barrel Organ Museum Haarlem, Museum van de Geest (a museum of psychiatry), the Ten Boom Museum (a hiding place for Jews in World War II) and the Historisch Museum Haarlem, across from the Frans Hals Museum.

===Theater, film and cultural centres===
The city contains several theatres, a cinema and other cultural attractions. The Philharmonie is a concert hall in the centre of the city, near the Grote Markt. Next to it is the Toneelschuur theatre, which also has some movie theatres (often referred to as the Filmschuur). The Stadsschouwburg on the Wilsonsplein reopened in 2008 after a major renovation and can seat 698.

The Cinema Palace was established in 1915 and was one of the older cinemas in the Netherlands. It closed definitively on 15 January 2011. The Brinkmann cinema, located on the Grote Markt, closed on 1 February 2012. The only cinema in Haarlem is Pathé Haarlem, located in the newly built Raaks shopping mall. This cinema opened on 5 July 2011.

The Patronaat is a pop music hall, one of the larger of its kind in the Netherlands. It is a popular night spot in the city.

===Festivals===
Every year in April, the bloemencorso (flower parade) takes place. Floats decorated with flowers drive from Noordwijk to Haarlem, where they are exhibited for one day. In the same month there is also a funfair organised on the Grote Markt and the Zaanenlaan in Haarlem-Noord. Other festivals are held on the Grote Markt as well, in particular the annual Haarlem Jazz &amp; More (formerly known as Haarlem Jazzstad), a music festival; Haarlem Culinair, a culinary event; and the biannual Haarlemse Stripdagen (Haarlem comic days).

Bevrijdingspop is a music festival to celebrate the Dutch liberation from the Nazis after World War II. It is held every year on 5 May, the day that the Netherlands were liberated in 1945, at the Haarlemmerhout. At the same location, the Haarlemmerhoutfestival is held every year, which is a music and theatre festival.

===Sports===

Haarlem has many different sport clubs practicing a great diversity of sports.

There are several amateur association football clubs. Haarlem also had a professional football club, HFC Haarlem, which went bankrupt in January 2010. Another Haarlem based football club still in existence is Koninklijke HFC (Royal Haarlemsche Football Club). It was founded by Pim Mulier in 1879 as the first football club in the Netherlands, making it the oldest club in Dutch history.

Tennis club HLTC Haarlem, founded in 1884, and judo association Kenamju, founded in 1948, are also the oldest Dutch clubs in their sports. RFC Haarlem is a rugby club.

Haarlem is known for hosting several international sports tournaments as well: the Haarlemse Honkbalweek (Haarlem Baseball Week), a baseball event held every two years at the Pim Mulier Stadium (named after Pim Mulier), and the Haarlem Basketball Classic, a basketball event. Haarlem also hosted the 2014 Women&#x27;s Softball World Championship.

The first international bandy match was played between Haarlem and Bury Fen Bandy Club in 1891. Some rink bandy exists today.

==Miscellaneous==
===Local beer===
Beer brewing has been a very important industry for Haarlem going back to the 15th century, when there were no fewer than 100 breweries in the city. When the town&#x27;s 750th anniversary was celebrated in 1995 a group of enthusiasts re-created an original Haarlem beer and brewed it again. The beer is called Jopenbier, or Jopen for short, named after an old type of beer barrel.

===Harlem, Manhattan===
In 1658, Peter Stuyvesant, the Director-General of the Dutch colony of Nieuw Nederland (New Netherland), founded the settlement of Nieuw Haarlem in the northern part of Manhattan Island as an outpost of Nieuw Amsterdam (New Amsterdam) at the southern tip of the island. After the English capture of New Netherland in 1664, the new English colonial administration renamed both the colony and its principal city &quot;New York,&quot; but left the name of Haarlem more or less unchanged. The spelling changed to Harlem in keeping with contemporary English usage, and the district grew (as part of the borough of Manhattan) into the vibrant centre of African American culture in New York City and the United States generally by the 20th century.

=== Lautje, statue on the Grote Markt ===
On the main square, the Grote Markt, stands a statue of Laurens Janszoon Coster, nicknamed &#x27;Lautje&#x27; by locals. Laurens Janszoon Coster is credited with being the inventor of a printing press using movable type, since he&#x27;s said to have invented it simultaneously with Johannes Gutenberg, but only some people believe this. In the past, the statue was moved a couple of times. It once stood at the other side of the square and even perched at the Riviervismarkt, near the Philharmonie.

=== Universities ===
The group of universities SRH opened a campus in Haarlem in 2022 on the site of the former Cupola prison.

=== Meat advertisement ban ===
Haarlem is set to ban most meat ads from public spaces because of the food&#x27;s climate impact, starting from 2024. It is the first city in the world to make such a move.

<text>Boris Vasilievich Spassky (; January 30, 1937 – February 27, 2025) was a Russian chess grandmaster who was the tenth World Chess Champion, holding the title from 1969 to 1972. Spassky played three world championship matches: he lost to Tigran Petrosian in 1966; defeated Petrosian in 1969 to become world champion; then lost to Bobby Fischer in a famous match in 1972.

Spassky won the Soviet Chess Championship twice outright (1961, 1973), and twice lost in playoffs (1956, 1963), after tying for first place during the event proper. He was a World Chess Championship candidate on seven occasions (1956, 1965, 1968, 1974, 1977, 1980, and 1985). In addition to his candidates wins in 1965 and 1968, Spassky reached the semi-final stage in 1974 and the final stage in 1977.

Spassky emigrated to France in 1976 and became a French citizen in 1978. He continued to compete in tournaments but was no longer a major contender for the world title. Spassky lost an unofficial rematch against Fischer in 1992. In 2012, he left France and returned to Russia.

==Early life==
Spassky was born in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) to Russian parents. His father, Vasili Vladimirovich Spassky, served in the military. He came from the family of Vladimir Alexandrovich Spassky, a prominent Russian Orthodox priest of the Kursk Governorate, later a protoiereus of the Russian Church (since 1916), as well as a State Duma deputy (1912–1917) and an active member of the Union of the Russian People. Boris&#x27; mother Ekaterina Petrovna Spasskaya (&quot;née&quot; Petrova) was a school teacher. She was born in the Ryadnevo village of the Gdov district (now Pskov Oblast) as an illegitimate daughter of Daria Ivanovna Ivanova (from a local peasant family) and Andrei Kupriyanovich Kupriyanov, a landlord who owned houses in Saint Petersburg and Pskov. After some time Daria Ivanovna fled to St. Petersburg, leaving her daughter with Petr Vasiliev, a relative of hers, who raised Ekaterina under the surname of Petrova. She joined her mother later on.

Spassky learned to play chess at the age of five on a train evacuating from Leningrad during the siege of Leningrad in World War II. During the war, he was sent to an orphanage in Siberia. He first drew wide attention in 1947 at age 10, when he defeated Soviet champion Mikhail Botvinnik in a simultaneous exhibition in Leningrad. Spassky&#x27;s early coach was Vladimir Zak, a respected master and trainer. During his youth, from the age of 10, Spassky often worked on chess for several hours a day with master-level coaches. He set records as the youngest Soviet player to achieve first category rank (age 10), candidate master rank (age 11), and Soviet Master rank (age 15). In 1952, at 15, Spassky scored 50 percent in the Soviet Championship semi-final at Riga, and placed second in the Leningrad Championship that same year, for which he was highly praised by Botvinnik.

==Career==
As a statistic encompassing all of the games of his career, Spassky&#x27;s most-played openings with both the White and Black pieces were the Sicilian Defence and the Ruy Lopez.

Spassky beat six undisputed World Champions at least twice (not necessarily while they were reigning): Vasily Smyslov, Mikhail Tal, Tigran Petrosian, Bobby Fischer, Anatoly Karpov, and Garry Kasparov.

===Young grandmaster===

Spassky made his international debut in 1953, aged sixteen, in Bucharest, Romania, finishing tied for fourth place with Laszlo Szabo on 12/19, an event won by his trainer, Alexander Tolush. At Bucharest he defeated Vasily Smyslov, who challenged for the World Championship the following year. In the same year, Spassky was awarded the title of International Master by FIDE at its congress in Schaffhausen, Switzerland. In his first attempt at the Soviet Championship final, the 22nd in the series, held in Moscow 1955, Spassky tied for third place with 11½/19, after Smyslov and Efim Geller, which was sufficient to qualify him for the Gothenburg Interzonal later that year.

The same year, he won the World Junior Chess Championship held at Antwerp, Belgium, scoring 6/7 to qualify for the final, then 8/9 in the final to win by a full point over Edmar Mednis. Spassky competed for the Lokomotiv Voluntary Sports Society.

By sharing seventh place with 11/20 at Gothenburg, Spassky qualified for the 1956 Candidates&#x27; Tournament, held in Amsterdam, automatically gaining the grandmaster title, and was then the youngest to hold the title. At Amsterdam, he tied for third place with four others in the ten-player field, scoring 9½/18. At the 23rd Soviet final, held in Leningrad in January–February 1956, Spassky shared first place on 11½/19, with Mark Taimanov and Yuri Averbakh, but Taimanov won the subsequent playoff to become champion, defeating Spassky in both their games. Spassky then tied for first in a semifinal for the 24th Soviet championship, thereby qualifying.

===Uneven results===
Spassky then went into a slump in world championship qualifying events, failing to advance to the next two Interzonals (1958 and 1962), a prerequisite to earn the right to play for the world championship. This crisis coincided with the hard three final years of his first marriage before his divorce in 1961, the same year that he broke with his trainer Tolush.

In the 24th Soviet final, played at Moscow in January–February 1957, Spassky shared fourth place with Tolush, as both scored 13/21, while Mikhail Tal won the first of his six Soviet titles, which began his ascent to the world title in 1960.

Spassky&#x27;s failure to qualify for the Portoroz Interzonal came after a last-round defeat at the hands of Tal, in a nervy game in the 1958 Soviet championship, held at Riga. Spassky had the advantage for much of the game, but missed a difficult win after adjournment, then declined a draw. A win would have qualified Spassky for the Interzonal, and a draw would have ensured a share of fourth place with Yuri Averbakh, with qualification possible via a playoff.

Spassky tied for first place at Moscow 1959 on 7/11, with Smyslov and David Bronstein. He shared second place in the 26th Soviet final with Tal, at Tbilisi 1959, finishing a point behind champion Tigran Petrosian, on 12½/19. Soon after Spassky notched a victory at Riga 1959, with 11½/13, one-half point in front of Vladas Mikėnas. Spassky finished in a tie for ninth at the 27th Soviet final in Leningrad, with 10/19, as fellow Leningrader Viktor Korchnoi scored his first of four Soviet titles. Spassky travelled to Argentina, where he shared first place with Bobby Fischer, two points ahead of Bronstein, at Mar del Plata 1960 on 13½/15, defeating Fischer in their first career meeting. Spassky played on board one for the USSR at the 7th Student Olympiad in Leningrad, where he won the silver, but lost the gold to William Lombardy, also losing their individual encounter.

Another disappointment for Spassky came at the qualifier for the next Interzonal, the Soviet final, played in Moscow 1961, where he again lost a crucial last-round game, this to Leonid Stein, who thus qualified, as Spassky finished equal fifth with 11/19, while Petrosian won.

===Title contender===
Spassky decided upon a switch in trainers, from the volatile attacker Tolush to the calmer strategist Igor Bondarevsky. This proved the key to his resurgence. He won his first of two USSR titles in the 29th Soviet championship at Baku 1961, with a score of 14½/20, one-half point ahead of Lev Polugaevsky. Spassky shared second with Polugaevsky at Havana 1962 with 16/21, behind winner Miguel Najdorf. He placed joint fifth, with Leonid Stein at the 30th Soviet championship held in Yerevan 1962, with 11½/19. At Leningrad 1963, the site of the 31st Soviet final, Spassky tied for first with Stein and Ratmir Kholmov, with Stein winning the playoff, which was held in 1964. Spassky won at Belgrade 1964 with an undefeated 13/17, as Korchnoi and Borislav Ivkov shared second place with 11½. He finished fourth at Sochi 1964 with 9½/15, as Nikolai Krogius won.

In the 1964 Soviet Zonal at Moscow, a seven-player double round-robin event, Spassky won with 7/12, overcoming a start of one draw and two losses, to advance to the Amsterdam Interzonal the same year. At Amsterdam, he tied for first place, along with Mikhail Tal, Vasily Smyslov and Bent Larsen on 17/23, with all four, along with Borislav Ivkov and Lajos Portisch thus qualifying for the newly created Candidates&#x27; Matches the next year. With Bondarevsky, Spassky&#x27;s style broadened and deepened, with poor results mostly banished, yet his fighting spirit was even enhanced. He added psychology and surprise to his quiver, and this proved enough to eventually propel him to the top.

===Challenger===
Spassky was considered an all-rounder on the chess board, and his adaptable &quot;universal style&quot; was a distinct advantage in beating many top grandmasters. In the 1965 cycle, he beat Paul Keres in the quarterfinal round at Riga 1965 with careful strategy, triumphing in the last game to win 6–4 (+4−2=4). Also at Riga, he defeated Efim Geller with mating attacks, winning by 5½–2½ (+3−0=5). Then, in his Candidates&#x27; Final match against Mikhail Tal at Tbilisi 1965, Spassky often managed to steer play into quieter positions, either avoiding former champion Tal&#x27;s tactical strength, or exacting too high a price for complications. Though losing the first game, he won by 7–4 (+4−1=6).

Spassky won two tournaments in the run-up to the final. He shared first at the third Chigorin Memorial in Sochi, in 1965 with Wolfgang Unzicker on 10½/15, then tied for first at Hastings 1965–66 with Wolfgang Uhlmann on 7½/9.

Spassky lost a keenly fought match to Petrosian in Moscow, with three wins against Petrosian&#x27;s four, with seventeen draws, though the last of his three victories came only in the twenty-third game, after Petrosian had ensured his retention of the title, the first outright match victory for a reigning champion since the latter of Alekhine&#x27;s successful defences against Bogoljubov in 1934. Spassky&#x27;s first event after the title match was the fourth Chigorin Memorial, where he finished tied for fifth with Anatoly Lein as Korchnoi won. Spassky then finished ahead of Petrosian and a super-class field at Santa Monica 1966 (the Piatigorsky Cup), with 11½/18, half a point ahead of Bobby Fischer, as he overcame the American grandmaster&#x27;s challenge after Fischer had scored 3½/9 in the first cycle of the event. Spassky also won at Beverwijk 1967 with 11/15, one-half point ahead of Anatoly Lutikov, and shared first place at Sochi 1967 on 10/15 with Krogius, Alexander Zaitsev, Leonid Shamkovich, and Vladimir Simagin.

As losing finalist in 1966, Spassky was automatically seeded into the next Candidates&#x27; cycle. In 1968, he faced Geller again, this time at Sukhumi, and won by the same margin as in 1965 (5½–2½, +3−0=5). He next met Bent Larsen at Malmö, and again won by the score of 5½–2½ after winning the first three games. The final was against his Leningrad rival Korchnoi at Kiev, and Spassky triumphed (+4−1=5), which earned him another match with Petrosian. Spassky&#x27;s final tournament appearance before the match came at Palma, where he shared second place (+10−1=6) with Larsen, a point behind Korchnoi. Spassky&#x27;s flexibility of style was the key to victory over Petrosian, by 12½–10½, with the site again being Moscow.

===World Champion===
In Spassky&#x27;s first appearance after winning the crown, he placed first at San Juan, Puerto Rico, in October 1969 with 11½/15, one and one-half points clear of second. He then played the annual event at Palma, where he finished fifth with 10/17. While Spassky was undefeated and handed tournament victor Larsen one of his three losses, his fourteen draws kept him from seriously contending for first prize, as he came two points behind Larsen. In March–April 1970, Spassky played first board for the Soviet side in the celebrated USSR vs World event at Belgrade, where he scored +1−1=1 in the first three rounds against Larsen before Stein replaced him for the final match, as the Soviets won by the odd point, 20½–19½. He won a quadrangular event at Leiden 1970 with 7/12, a point ahead of Jan Hein Donner, who was followed by Larsen and Botvinnik, the latter of whom was making his final appearance in serious play. Spassky shared first at the annual IBM event held in Amsterdam 1970 with Polugaevsky on 11½/15. He was third at Gothenburg 1971 with 8/11, behind winners Vlastimil Hort and Ulf Andersson. He shared first with Hans Ree at the 1971 Canadian Open in Vancouver. In November and December, Spassky finished the year by tying for sixth with Tal, scoring +4−2=11, at the Alekhine Memorial in Moscow, which was won by Stein and Anatoly Karpov, the latter&#x27;s first top-class success.

===Championship match with Fischer===
Spassky&#x27;s reign as world champion lasted for three years, as he lost to Fischer of the United States in 1972 in the World Chess Championship 1972, popularly known as the Match of the Century. The contest took place in Reykjavík, Iceland, at the height of the Cold War, and consequently was seen as symbolic of the political confrontation between the two superpowers. Spassky accommodated many demands by Fischer, including moving the third game into a side room. The Fischer vs Spassky World championship was the most widely covered chess match in history, reported upon by mainstream media throughout the world. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger spoke with Fischer urging him to play the match, and chess was at its apex.

Going into the match, Fischer had never won a game from Spassky in five attempts, losing three. In addition, Spassky had secured Geller as his coach, who also had a plus score against Fischer. However, Fischer won the title match 12½/8½ (+7−3=11), with one of the three losses by default.

The match could be divided into halves, the first won convincingly by Fischer, and the second a close battle. Before the match, Fischer had defeated Mark Taimanov, Bent Larsen, and Tigran Petrosian, but Spassky maintained his composure and competitiveness. It has been suggested that Spassky&#x27;s preparation was largely bypassed by Fischer, since Spassky and his team wrongly expected Fischer to always play 1. e4 openings as White.

According to Reshevsky, the match as a whole was disappointing. &quot;It was marked by blunders by both players. The blunders committed by Spassky were incredible. In two games, for example, Spassky overlooked a one-move combination. In the first, he was compelled to resign immediately, and, in the other, he threw away all chances for a win. Fischer was also not in his best form. He made errors in a number of games. His play lacked brilliance, but his defense was excellent.&quot;

===Ex-champion (1973–1985)===

In February–March 1973, Spassky finished equal third at Tallinn with 9/15, three points behind Tal; he tied for first at Dortmund on 9½/15 (+5−1=9) with Hans-Joachim Hecht and Ulf Andersson. Spassky finished in fourth place at the annual IBM tournament held in Amsterdam, one point behind winners Petrosian and Albin Planinc. In September, Spassky went 10/15 to finish second to Tal in the Chigorin Memorial at Sochi by a point. In the 41st Soviet Championship at Moscow, Spassky scored 11½/17 to win by a full point in a field which included all the top Soviet grandmasters of the time.
In the 1974 Candidates&#x27; matches, Spassky first defeated American Robert Byrne in San Juan, Puerto Rico, by 4½–1½ (+3−0=3); he then lost the semifinal match to Anatoly Karpov in Leningrad, despite winning the first game, (+1−4=6). In Spassky&#x27;s only tournament action of 1974, he played at Solingen, finishing with 8½/14 (+4−1=9), thus sharing third with Bojan Kurajica, behind joint winners Lubomir Kavalek and Polugaevsky, who scored 10.

During 1975, Spassky played two events, the first being the annual tournament at Tallinn, where he finished equal second with Fridrik Olafsson, scoring 9½/15 (+5−1=9), one point behind Keres, the last international event won by the latter before his sudden death in June 1975. In October–November, Spassky finished second to Geller at the Alekhine Memorial in Moscow with a score of 10 points from fifteen games (+6−1=8).

In 1976, Spassky was obliged to return to the Interzonal stage, and finished in a tie for tenth place in Manila, well short of qualifying for the Candidates matches, but was nominated to play after Fischer declined his place. Spassky won an exhibition match with Dutch grandmaster Jan Timman at Amsterdam 1977 by 4–2. He triumphed in extra games in his quarterfinal Candidates&#x27; match over Vlastimil Hort at Reykjavík 1977 by 8½–7½. This match saw Spassky fall ill, exhaust all his available rest days while recovering; then the healthy Hort used one of his own rest days, to allow Spassky more time to recover; Spassky eventually won the match.

Spassky won an exhibition match over Robert Hübner at Solingen, 1977 by 3½–2½, then defeated Lubomir Kavalek, also at Solingen, by 4–2 in another exhibition. His next Candidates&#x27; match was against Portisch at Geneva 1977, and Spassky won by 8½–6½, to qualify for the final. At Belgrade 1977–78, Spassky lost to Korchnoi, by (+4−7=7). In this match, Spassky fell behind 2½–7½ after losing the tenth game; however, he then won four consecutive games. After draws in games fifteen and sixteen, Korchnoi won the next two games to clinch the match by the score of 10½–7½.

Spassky, as losing finalist, was seeded into the 1980 Candidates&#x27; matches, and faced Portisch again, with this match held in Mexico. After fourteen games, the match was 7–7, but Portisch advanced since he had won more games with the black pieces. Spassky narrowly missed qualification from the 1982 Toluca Interzonal with 8/13, finishing half a point short, in third place behind Portisch and Eugenio Torre, both of whom thus qualified. The 1985 Candidates&#x27; event was held as a round-robin tournament at Montpellier, France, and Spassky was nominated as an organizer&#x27;s choice. He scored 8/15 to tie for sixth place with Alexander Beliavsky, behind joint winners Andrei Sokolov, Rafael Vaganian, and Artur Yusupov, and once again – one-half point short of potentially qualifying via a playoff. This was Spassky&#x27;s last appearance at the Candidates&#x27; level.

Spassky played board one in the USSR vs Rest of the World match at Belgrade 1970, scoring (+1−1=1) against Larsen.

Spassky then represented France in three Olympiads, on board one in each case. For Thessaloniki 1984, he scored 8/14 (+2−0=12). At Dubai 1986, he scored 9/14 (+4−0=10). Finally at Thessaloniki 1988, he scored 7½/13 (+3−1=9). He also played board one for France at the inaugural World Team Championships, Lucerne 1985, where he scored 5½/9 (+3−1=5).

===Later tournament career (after 1976)===

In his later years, Spassky showed a reluctance to devote himself completely to chess. In 1976, he emigrated to France with his third wife; he became a French citizen in 1978, and competed for France in the Chess Olympiads. Spassky later lived with his wife in Meudon near Paris.

Spassky did, however, score some notable triumphs in his later years. In his return to tournament play after the loss to Korchnoi, he tied for first at Bugojno 1978 on 10/15 with Karpov, with both players scoring +6-1=8 to finish a point ahead of Timman. He was clear first at Montilla–Moriles 1978 with 6½/9. At Munich 1979, he tied for first place with 8½/13, with Yuri Balashov, Andersson and Robert Hübner. He shared first at Baden in 1980, on 10½/15 with Alexander Beliavsky. He won his preliminary group at Hamburg 1982 with 5½/6, but lost the final playoff match to Anatoly Karpov in extra games. His best result during this period was clear first at Linares 1983 with 6½/10, ahead of Karpov and Ulf Andersson, who shared second. At London Lloyds&#x27; Bank Open 1984, he tied for first with John Nunn and Murray Chandler, on 7/9. He won at Reykjavík 1985. At Brussels 1985, he placed second with 10½/13 behind Korchnoi. At Reggio Emilia 1986, he tied for 2nd–5th places with 6/11 behind Zoltán Ribli. He swept Fernand Gobet 4–0 in a match at Fribourg 1987. He finished equal first at the Plaza tournament in the New Zealand International Festival of the Arts at Wellington in 1988, with Chandler and Eduard Gufeld. Spassky&#x27;s Elo rating was in the world top ten continually throughout the early 1980s until it dropped out in 1983, and intermittently throughout the mid 1980s until it dropped out for the final time in 1987.

However, Spassky&#x27;s performances in the World Cup events of 1988 and 1989 showed that he could by this stage finish no higher than the middle of the pack against elite fields. He participated in three of the six events of the World Cup. At Belfort, he scored 8/15 for a joint 4th–7th place, as Garry Kasparov won. At Reykjavík, he scored 7/17 for a joint 15th–16th place, with Kasparov again winning. Finally, at Barcelona, Spassky scored 7½/16 for a tied 8th–12th place, as Kasparov shared first with Ljubomir Ljubojević.

Spassky played in the 1990 French Championship at Angers, placing fourth with 10½/15, as Marc Santo-Roman won. At Salamanca 1991, he placed 2nd with 7½/11 behind winner Evgeny Vladimirov. Then in the 1991 French Championship at Montpellier, he scored 9½/15 for a tied 4th–5th place, as Santo-Roman won again.

In 1992, Bobby Fischer, after a twenty-year hiatus from chess, re-emerged to arrange a &quot;Revenge Match of the 20th century&quot; against Spassky in Montenegro and Belgrade; this was a rematch of the 1972 World Championship. At the time, Spassky was rated 106th in the FIDE rankings, and Fischer did not appear on the list at all, owing to his inactivity. Spassky lost the match with a score of +5−10=15. However, Spassky earned US$1.65 million for losing the match.

Spassky then played the 16-year-old prodigy Judit Polgár in a 1993 match in Budapest, losing narrowly by 4½–5½.

Spassky continued to play occasional events through much of the 1990s, such as the Veterans vs Women match in Prague, 1995.

==Life since 2000==

On October 1, 2006, Spassky suffered a minor stroke during a chess lecture in San Francisco. In his first major post-stroke play, he drew a six-game rapid match with Hungarian Grandmaster Lajos Portisch in April 2007.

On March 27, 2010, at 73 years old, he became the oldest surviving former World Chess Champion following the death of Vasily Smyslov.

On September 23, 2010, ChessBase reported that Spassky had suffered a more serious stroke that had left him paralysed on his left side. After that he returned to France for a long rehabilitation programme. On August 16, 2012, Spassky left France to return to Russia under disputed circumstances and took up residence in an apartment in Moscow.

On September 25, 2016, he made a public speech at the opening of the Tal Memorial tournament. He said he had &quot;the very brightest memories&quot; of Mikhail Tal and told an anecdote from the 15th Chess Olympiad about Soviet analysis of an adjourned game between Fischer and Botvinnik. He was described by Chess24 as being &#x27;sprightly&#x27;. In later years, he kept away from the public eye.

==Legacy==
Spassky&#x27;s best years were as a youthful prodigy in the mid-1950s, and in the mid- to late 1960s. He applauded Fischer in Game 6 of their 1972 match, and defended Fischer when the latter was detained near Narita Airport in 2004.

Spassky has been described by many as a universal player. Never a true openings expert, at least when compared to contemporaries such as Geller and Fischer, he excelled in the middlegame and in tactics.

Spassky succeeded with a wide variety of openings, including the King&#x27;s Gambit, 1.e4 e5 2.f4, an aggressive and risky line rarely seen at the top level. The chess game between &quot;Kronsteen&quot; and &quot;McAdams&quot; in the early part of the James Bond movie &quot;From Russia With Love&quot; is based on a game in that opening played between Spassky and David Bronstein in 1960 in which Spassky (&quot;Kronsteen&quot;) was victorious.

His contributions to opening theory extend to reviving the Marshall Attack for Black in the Ruy Lopez (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 4.Ba4 Nf6 5.0-0 Be7 6.Re1 b5 7.Bb3 0-0 8.c3 d5), developing the Leningrad Variation for White in the Nimzo-Indian Defence (1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.Bg5), the Spassky Variation on the Black side of the Nimzo-Indian, and the Closed Variation of the Sicilian Defence for White (1.e4 c5 2.Nc3). A variation of the B19 Caro-Kann (1.e4 c6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 dxe4 4.Nxe4 Bf5 5.Ng3 Bg6 6.h4 h6 7.Nf3 Nd7 8.h5) also bears his name, as does a rare line in the King&#x27;s Indian Attack (1.Nf3 Nf6 2.g3 b5!?).

Spassky was played by Liev Schreiber in the 2014 film &quot;Pawn Sacrifice&quot;.

==Personal life== 
Boris was married three times. His first wife (1959–1961) was Nadezda Konstantinovna Latyntceva. Their daughter was born in 1960. His second wife was Larisa Zakharovna Solovyova. She gave birth to a son in 1967. His third marriage, in 1975 in France, was to Marina Yurievna Shcherbachova, granddaughter of the Russian war general and a White movement activist Dmitry Shcherbachev. Their son was born in 1980.

His younger sister Iraida Spasskaya (born November 6, 1944) is a four-time champion of the Soviet Union in Russian draughts and the world vice-champion in international draughts (1974).

In an interview to a Western journalist Spassky talked about his psychological approach to chess: 
Bobby Fischer once wrote that &quot;Spassky sits at the board with the same dead expression whether he&#x27;s mating or being mated. He can blunder away a piece and you are never sure whether it&#x27;s a blunder or a fantastically deep sacrifice.&quot;

===Politics and religion===
During his meeting with fans in Kaliningrad in 2005 Spassky stated about the economic and social decline of Russia in the 1990s: &quot;If only I knew what was going to happen to our country, I would&#x27;ve joined the Communist Party.&quot;

In 2005 Spassky signed the Letter of 5000 addressed to the Prosecutor General of Russia, along with Igor Shafarevich, Vyacheslav Klykov, Vasily Belov and other activists. The petition suggested that all religious and national Jewish organizations that functioned on the territory of Russia according to the Shulchan Aruch codes should be shut down for extremism, warning about a &quot;hidden campaign of genocide against the Russian people and their traditional society and values&quot;. He later tried to distance himself from the petition, saying that signing the petition was a mistake.

In 2006, Boris Spassky described himself as an Orthodox Christian, a monarchist and a Russian nationalist.

===Death===
Spassky died in Moscow on February 27, 2025, at the age of 88.

<text>Don Van Vliet (; born Don Glen Vliet; January 15, 1941 – December 17, 2010) was an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and visual artist best known by the stage name Captain Beefheart. Conducting a rotating ensemble known as the Magic Band, he recorded 13 studio albums between 1967 and 1982. His music blended elements of blues, free jazz, rock, and avant-garde composition with idiosyncratic rhythms, absurdist wordplay, and Vliet’s gravelly singing voice with a wide vocal range. Renowned as an enigmatic persona, Beefheart frequently constructed myths about his life and was known to exercise extreme, dictatorial control over his supporting musicians. Although he achieved little commercial success, he sustained a cult following as an influence on an array of experimental rock and punk-era artists.

A sculpting prodigy in his childhood, Van Vliet developed an interest in blues, R&amp;B, and jazz during his teen years in Lancaster, California, and formed &quot;a mutually useful but volatile&quot; friendship with musician Frank Zappa, with whom he sporadically competed and collaborated. He began performing in his Captain Beefheart persona in 1964 and joined the original Magic Band line-up, initiated by Alexis Snouffer, the same year. The group released their debut album &quot;Safe as Milk&quot; in 1967 on Buddah Records. After being dropped by two consecutive record labels they signed to Zappa&#x27;s Straight Records, where they released 1969&#x27;s &quot;Trout Mask Replica;&quot; the album would later rank 58th in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. In 1974, frustrated by a lack of commercial success, he pursued a more conventional rock sound, but the ensuing albums were critically panned; this move, combined with not having been paid for a European tour, and years of enduring Beefheart&#x27;s abusive behavior, led the entire band to quit.

Beefheart eventually formed a new Magic Band with a group of younger musicians and regained critical approval through three final albums: &quot;Shiny Beast&quot; (1978), &quot;Doc at the Radar Station&quot; (1980) and &quot;Ice Cream for Crow&quot; (1982). Van Vliet made few public appearances after his retirement from music in 1982. He pursued a career in art, an interest that originated in his childhood talent for sculpture, and a venture that proved to be his most financially secure. His abstract expressionist paintings and drawings command high prices, and have been exhibited in art galleries and museums across the world. Van Vliet died in 2010, having had multiple sclerosis for many years.

==Biography==

===Early life and musical influences, 1941–62===

Van Vliet was born Don Glen Vliet in Glendale, California, on January 15, 1941, to Glen Alonzo Vliet, a service station owner of Dutch ancestry from Kansas, and Willie Sue Vliet (née Warfield), who was from Arkansas. He said that he was descended from Peter van Vliet, a Dutch painter who knew Rembrandt. Van Vliet also said that he was related to adventurer and author Richard Halliburton and cowboy actor Slim Pickens, and he said that he remembered being born.

Van Vliet began painting and sculpting at age three. His subjects reflected his &quot;obsession&quot; with animals, particularly dinosaurs, fish, African mammals and lemurs. Considered a child prodigy, at age four he was featured with his animal sculptures on a weekly Los Angeles television program. At the age of nine, he won a children&#x27;s sculpting competition organized for the Los Angeles Zoo in Griffith Park by a local tutor, Agostinho Rodrigues. Local newspaper cuttings of his junior sculpting achievements can be found reproduced in the &quot;Splinters&quot; book, included in the &quot;Riding Some Kind of Unusual Skull Sleigh&quot; boxed CD work, released in 2004. The sprawling park, with its zoo and observatory, had a strong influence on young Vliet, as it was a short distance from his home on Waverly Drive. The track &quot;Observatory Crest&quot; on &quot;Bluejeans &amp; Moonbeams&quot; reflects this continued interest. A portrait photo of school-age Vliet can be seen on the front of the lyric sheet within the first issue of the US release of &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot;.

For some time during the 1950s, Van Vliet worked as an apprentice with Rodrigues, who considered him a child prodigy. Van Vliet said that he was a lecturer at the Barnsdall Art Institute in Los Angeles at the age of eleven, although it is likely he simply gave a form of artistic dissertation. Accounts of Van Vliet&#x27;s precocious achievement in art often include his statement that he sculpted on a weekly television show. He said that his parents discouraged his interest in sculpture, based upon their perception of artists as &quot;queer&quot;. According to one of Van Vliet&#x27;s versions of this story, they declined several scholarship offers, including one from the local Knudsen Creamery to travel to Europe with six years&#x27; paid tuition to study marble sculpture. Van Vliet was deeply disappointed by their denial of this opportunity for him to realize his potential as an artist. He later claimed that the experience made him so bitter that he never listened to music and abandoned his art until he was twenty-three.

Van Vliet&#x27;s artistic enthusiasm became so fervent, he said that his parents were forced to feed him through the door in the room where he sculpted. When he was thirteen the family moved from the Los Angeles area to the more remote farming town of Lancaster, in the Mojave Desert, where there was a growing aerospace industry supported by nearby Edwards Air Force Base. It was an environment that would greatly influence him creatively from then on. Van Vliet remained interested in art; several of his paintings, often reminiscent of Franz Kline were later used as front covers for his music albums. Meanwhile, he developed his taste and interest in music, listening &quot;intensively&quot; to the Delta blues of Son House and Robert Johnson, jazz artists such as Ornette Coleman, John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk and Cecil Taylor, and the Chicago blues of Howlin&#x27; Wolf and Muddy Waters. During his early teenage years, Vliet would sometimes socialize with members of local bands such as the Omens and the Blackouts, although his interests were still focused upon an art career. The Omens&#x27; guitarists Alexis Snouffer and Jerry Handley would later become founders of &quot;the Magic Band&quot; and the Blackouts&#x27; drummer, Frank Zappa, would later capture Vliet&#x27;s vocal capabilities on record for the first time. This first known recording, when he was simply &quot;Don Vliet&quot;, is &quot;Lost in a Whirlpool&quot; – one of Zappa&#x27;s early &quot;field recordings&quot; made in his college classroom with brother Bobby on guitar. It is featured on Zappa&#x27;s posthumously released &quot;The Lost Episodes&quot; (1996).

Van Vliet said that he never attended public school, alleging &quot;half a day of kindergarten&quot; to be the extent of his formal education and saying that &quot;if you want to be a different fish, you&#x27;ve got to jump out of the school&quot;. His associates said that he only dropped out during his senior year of high school to help support the family after his father&#x27;s heart attack. His graduation picture appears in the school&#x27;s yearbook. His statements that he never attended school – and his general disavowals of education – may have been related to his experience of dyslexia which, although never officially diagnosed, was obvious to sidemen such as John French and Denny Walley, who observed his difficulty reading cue-cards on stage, and his frequent need to be read aloud to. While attending Antelope Valley High School in Lancaster, Van Vliet became close friends with fellow teenager Frank Zappa, the pair bonding through their interest in Chicago blues and R&amp;B. Van Vliet is portrayed in both &quot;The Real Frank Zappa Book&quot; and Barry Miles&#x27; biography &quot;Zappa&quot; as fairly spoiled at this stage of his life, the center of attention as an only child. He spent most of his time locked in his room listening to records, often with Zappa, into the early hours in the morning, eating leftover food from his father&#x27;s Helms bread truck and demanding that his mother bring him a Pepsi. His parents tolerated such behavior under the belief that their child was truly gifted. Vliet&#x27;s &quot;Pepsi-moods&quot; were ever a source of amusement to band members, leading Zappa to later write the wry tune &quot;Why Doesn&#x27;t Someone Give Him a Pepsi?&quot;, that featured on the &quot;Bongo Fury&quot; tour.

After Zappa began regular occupation at Paul Buff&#x27;s PAL Studio in Cucamonga he and Van Vliet began collaborating, tentatively as &quot;the Soots&quot; (pronounced &quot;suits&quot;). By the time Zappa had turned the venue into Studio Z the duo had completed some songs. These were &quot;Cheryl&#x27;s Canon&quot;, &quot;Metal Man Has Won His Wings&quot; and a Howlin&#x27; Wolf-styled rendition of Little Richard&#x27;s &quot;Slippin&#x27; and Slidin&#x27;&quot;. Further songs on Zappa&#x27;s &quot;Mystery Disc&quot; (1996), &quot;I Was a Teen-Age Malt Shop&quot; and &quot;The Birth of Captain Beefheart&quot;, also provide an insight to Zappa&#x27;s &quot;teenage movie&quot; script titled &quot;Captain Beefheart vs. the Grunt People&quot;, the first appearances of the Beefheart name. It has been suggested this name came from a term used by Vliet&#x27;s uncle Alan, who had a habit of exposing himself to Don&#x27;s girlfriend, Laurie Stone. He would urinate with the bathroom door open and, if she was walking by, would mumble about his penis, saying &quot;Ahh, what a beauty! It looks just like a big, fine beef heart&quot;. In a 1970 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Van Vliet requests &quot;don&#x27;t ask me why or how&quot; he and Zappa came up with the name. Johnny Carson also asked him the same question to which Van Vliet replied that one day he was standing on the pier and saw fishermen cutting the bills off pelicans. He said it made him sad and put &quot;a beef in his heart&quot;. Carson appeared nervous and uncomfortable interviewing Van Vliet and after the next commercial break Van Vliet was gone. He would later say in an appearance on &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; that the name referred to &quot;a beef in my heart against this society&quot;. In the &quot;Grunt People&quot; draft script Beefheart and his mother play themselves, with his father played by Howlin&#x27; Wolf. Moreover, the young Van Vliet used to go out with wet hair to catch a cold so that he could get a lower tone of voice as Howlin&#x27; Wolf. Grace Slick is penned in as a &quot;celestial seductress&quot; and there are also roles for future Magic Band members Bill Harkleroad and Mark Boston.

Van Vliet enrolled at Antelope Valley College as an art major, but decided to leave the following year. He once worked as a door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman, and sold a vacuum cleaner to the writer Aldous Huxley at his home in Llano, pointing to it and declaring, &quot;Well, I assure you sir, this thing sucks.&quot; After managing a Kinney&#x27;s shoe store, Van Vliet relocated to Rancho Cucamonga, California, to reconnect with Zappa, who inspired his entry into musical performance. Van Vliet was quite shy but was eventually able to imitate the deep voice of Howlin&#x27; Wolf with his wide vocal range. He eventually grew comfortable with public performance and, after learning to play the harmonica, began playing at dances and small clubs in Southern California.

===Initial recordings, 1962–69===
In early 1965 Alex Snouffer, a Lancaster rhythm and blues guitarist, invited Vliet to sing with a group that he was assembling. Vliet joined the first Magic Band and changed his name to Don Van Vliet, while Snouffer became Alex St. Clair (sometimes spelled &quot;Claire&quot;). Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band signed to A&amp;M and released two singles in 1966. The first was a version of Bo Diddley&#x27;s &quot;Diddy Wah Diddy&quot; that became a regional hit in Los Angeles. The followup, &quot;Moonchild&quot; (written by David Gates, later of the band Bread) was less well received. That year the band began to play some larger west coast venues, such as the Avalon Ballroom in San Francisco.

====&quot;Safe as Milk&quot;====
After fulfilling their deal for two singles the band presented demos to A&amp;M during 1966 for what would become the &quot;Safe as Milk&quot; album. A&amp;M&#x27;s Jerry Moss reportedly described this new direction as &quot;too negative&quot; and dropped the band from the label, although still under contract. Much of the demo recording was accomplished at Art Laboe&#x27;s Original Sound Studio, then with Gary Marker on the controls at Sunset Sound on 8-track. By the end of 1966 they were signed to Buddah Records and much of the demo work was transferred to 4-track, at the behest of Krasnow and Perry, in the RCA Studio in Hollywood, where the recording was finalized. Tracks that were originally laid down in the demo by Doug Moon are therefore taken up by Ry Cooder&#x27;s work in the release, as Moon had departed over &quot;musical differences&quot; at this juncture.

Drummer John French had now joined the group and it would later (notably on &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot;) be his patience that was required to transcribe Van Vliet&#x27;s creative ideas (often expressed by whistling or banging on the piano) into musical form for the other group members. On French&#x27;s departure this role was taken over by Bill Harkleroad for &quot;Lick My Decals Off, Baby&quot;.
Many of the lyrics on the &quot;Safe as Milk&quot; album were written by Van Vliet in collaboration with the writer Herb Bermann, who befriended Van Vliet after seeing him perform at a bar-gig in Lancaster in 1966. The song &quot;Electricity&quot; was a poem written by Bermann, who gave Van Vliet permission to adapt it to music. Unlike the album&#x27;s mostly blues rock sound, songs such as &quot;Electricity&quot; illustrated the band&#x27;s unconventional instrumentation and Van Vliet&#x27;s unusual vocals. When guitarist Doug Moon complained that the band was &quot;losing its soul&quot;, he was fired. In a 1995 interview Moon said that the songs on the album &quot;had evolved to become a little bit more avant-garde and a little bit more hinting at things to come in Don&#x27;s later albums&quot;.
Much of the &quot;Safe as Milk&quot; material was honed and arranged by the arrival of 20-year–old guitar prodigy Ry Cooder, who had been brought into the group after much pressure from Vliet. The band began recording in spring 1967, with Richard Perry cutting his teeth in his first job as producer. The album was released in September 1967. Richie Unterberger of Allmusic called the album &quot;blues–rock gone slightly askew, with jagged, fractured rhythms, soulful, twisting vocals from Van Vliet, and more doo wop, soul, straight blues, and folk–rock influences than he would employ on his more avant garde outings&quot;.

John Lennon displayed two of the album&#x27;s promotional &quot;baby bumper stickers&quot; in the sunroom at his home. The Beatles planned to sign Beefheart to their experimental Zapple label (plans that were scrapped after Allen Klein took over the group&#x27;s management). Vliet claimed to have met Paul McCartney in a Cannes hotel nightclub during their tour of Europe on January 27, 1968, urinated together on a statue outside the hotel at the prodding of journalists and photographers, and participated in a jam session together with McCartney and Penny Nichols. Producer attempts to convince McCartney to switch labels to Kama Sutra obstructed the possibility of a pleasant evening. McCartney later said he had no recollection of this meeting.

Van Vliet was often critical of the Beatles, however. He considered the lyric &quot;I&#x27;d love to turn you on&quot; from their song &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; to be ridiculous and conceited. Tiring of their &quot;lullabies&quot;, he lampooned them with the &quot;Strictly Personal&quot; song &quot;Beatle Bones &#x27;n&#x27; Smokin&#x27; Stones&quot;, that featured the sardonic refrain of &quot;strawberry fields, all the winged eels slither on the heels of today&#x27;s children, strawberry fields forever&quot;. Vliet spoke badly of Lennon after getting no response when he sent a telegram of support to him and wife Yoko Ono during their 1969 &quot;Bed-in for peace&quot;.

Doug Moon left the band because of his dislike of the band&#x27;s increasing experimentation outside his preferred blues genre. Ry Cooder told of Moon&#x27;s becoming so angered by Van Vliet&#x27;s unrelenting criticism that he walked into the room pointing a loaded crossbow at him, only to have Van Vliet tell him, &quot;Get that fucking thing out of here, get out of here and get back in your room&quot;, which he did. (Other band members dispute this account, though Moon is likely to have &quot;passed through&quot; the studio with a weapon.) Moon was present during the early demo sessions at Original Sound studio, above the Kama Sutra/Buddah offices. The works Moon laid down did not see the light of day, as he was replaced by Cooder when they continued on material at Sunset Sound with Marker. Marker then fell by the wayside when recording was moved by Krasnow and Perry to RCA Studio. This would have a profound effect on the quality of the &quot;Safe as Milk&quot; work, as the former studio was 8-track and the subsequent studio a 4-track.

To support the album&#x27;s release the group had been scheduled to play at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival. During this period, Vliet had severe anxiety attacks that made him convinced that he was having a heart attack, possibly exacerbated by his heavy LSD use and the fact that his father had died of heart failure a few years earlier. At a vital &quot;warm-up&quot; performance at the Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival (June 10–11) shortly before the scheduled Monterey Festival (June 16–18), the band began to play &quot;Electricity&quot; and Van Vliet froze, straightened his tie, then walked off the stage and landed on manager Bob Krasnow. He later claimed he had seen a girl in the audience turn into a fish, with bubbles coming from her mouth. This aborted any opportunity of breakthrough success at Monterey, as Cooder immediately decided he could no longer work with Van Vliet, effectively quitting both the event and the band on the spot. With such complex guitar parts there was no means for the band to find a competent replacement in time for Monterey. Cooder&#x27;s spot was eventually filled for a short spell by Gerry McGee, who had played with the Monkees. According to French the band did two gigs with McGee, one of which was at The Peppermint Twist near Long Beach. The other was at Santa Monica Civic Auditorium, August 7, 1967, as opening act for the Yardbirds. McGee was in the group long enough to have an outfit made by a Santa Monica boutique that also created the gear worn by the band on the &quot;Strictly Personal&quot; cover stamps.

====&quot;Strictly Personal&quot;====
In August 1967, guitarist Jeff Cotton filled the guitar spot vacated, in turn, by Cooder and McGee. In October and November 1967 the Snouffer/Cotton/Handley/French line–up recorded material for what was planned to be the second album. Originally intended to be a double album called &quot;It Comes to You in a Plain Brown Wrapper&quot; for the label, it was released later in pieces in 1971 and 1995. After rejection from Buddah, Bob Krasnow encouraged the band to re-record four of the shorter numbers, add two more, and make shorter versions of &quot;Mirror Man&quot; and &quot;Kandy Korn&quot;. Krasnow created a strange mix full of &quot;phasing&quot; that, by most accounts (including Beefheart&#x27;s), diminished the music&#x27;s strength. This was released in October 1968 as &quot;Strictly Personal&quot; on Krasnow&#x27;s Blue Thumb label. Stewart Mason in his Allmusic review of the album described it as a &quot;terrific album&quot; and a &quot;fascinating, underrated release ... every bit the equal of &quot;Safe as Milk&quot; and &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot;&quot;. Langdon Winner of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called &quot;Strictly Personal&quot; &quot;an excellent album. The guitars of the Magic Band mercilessly bend and stretch notes in a way that suggests that the world of music has wobbled clear off its axis&quot;, with the lyrics demonstrating &quot;Beefheart&#x27;s ability to juxtapose delightful humor with frightening insights&quot;.

====&quot;Mirror Man&quot;====
In 1971 some of the recordings done for Buddah were released as &quot;Mirror Man&quot;, bearing a liner note stating that the material had been recorded in &quot;one night in Los Angeles in 1965&quot;. This was a ruse to circumvent possible copyright issues. The material was recorded in November and December 1967. Essentially a &quot;jam&quot; album, described as pushing &quot;the boundaries of conventional blues–rock, with a Beefheart vocal tossed in here and there. Some may miss Beefheart&#x27;s surreal poetry, gruff vocals, and/or free jazz influence, while others may find it fascinating to hear the Magic Band simply letting go and cutting loose.&quot; The album&#x27;s &quot;miss-credit errors&quot; also state band members as &quot;Alex St. Clare Snouffer&quot; (Alex St. Clare/Alexis Snouffer), &quot;Antennae Jimmy Simmons&quot; (Semens/Jeff Cotton) and &quot;Jerry Handsley&quot; (Handley). The original vinyl was issued in both a die-cut gatefold (revealing a &quot;cracked&quot; mirror) and a single sleeve with the same image. The UK Buddah issue was part of the Polydor-manufactured &quot;Select&quot; series.

During his first trip to England in January 1968, Captain Beefheart was briefly represented in the UK by mod icon Peter Meaden, an early manager of the Who. The Captain and his band members were initially denied entry to the United Kingdom, because Meaden had illegally booked them for gigs without applying for appropriate work permits. After returning to Germany for a few days, press coverage and public outcry resulted in the band being permitted to re-enter the UK, where they recorded material for John Peel&#x27;s radio show and on Friday January 19 appeared at the &quot;Middle Earth&quot; venue, introduced by Peel, where they played tracks from &quot;Safe as Milk&quot; and some of the experimental blues tracks from &quot;Mirror Man&quot;. The band was met by an enthusiastic audience; French recalled the event as a rare high moment for the band: &quot;After the show, we were taken to the dressing room where we sat for hours as a line of what seemed like hundreds of people walked in one by one to shake our hand or get an autograph. Many brought imports of &quot;Safe as Milk&quot; with them for us to autograph ... It seemed like we had finally gained some reward ... Suddenly all the criticizing and intimidation and eccentricities seemed very unimportant. It was a glorious moment, one of the very few I ever experienced&quot;. By this time, they had terminated their association with Meaden. On January 27, 1968, Beefheart performed in the MIDEM Music Festival on the beach at Cannes, France.

Alex St. Claire left the band in June 1968 after their return from a second European tour and was replaced by teenager Bill Harkleroad; bassist Jerry Handley left a few weeks later.

====&quot;The &#x27;Brown Wrapper&#x27; Sessions&quot;====
After their Euro tour and the Cannes beach performance the band returned to the US. Moves were already in the air for them to leave Buddah and sign to MGM and, prior to their May tour – mainly in the UK – they re-recorded some Buddah material of the partial &quot;Mirror Man&quot; sessions at Sunset Sound with Bruce Botnick. Beefheart had also been conceptualizing new band names, including &quot;25th Century Quaker&quot; and &quot;Blue Thumb&quot;, while making suggestions to other musicians that they might get involved. The thought-process of &quot;25th Century Quaker&quot; was that it would be a &quot;blues band&quot; alias for the more avant-garde work of the Magic Band. Photographer Guy Webster photographed the band in Quaker-style outfits, and the picture appears in &quot;The Mirror Man Sessions&quot; CD insert. It would later transpire that much of this situation was transient and that Buddah&#x27;s Bob Krasnow was to set up his own label. The label that was unsurprisingly named &quot;Blue Thumb&quot; launched with its first release &quot;Strictly Personal&quot;, a truncated version of the original Beefheart vision of a double album. Thus &quot;25th Century Quaker&quot; became a track and a potential band-name became a label.

In overview, the works for the double album in this period were intended to be packaged in a plain brown wrapper, with a &quot;strictly personal&quot; over-stamp and addressed in a manner that could have connotations of drug content, pornographic or illicit material; as per the small ads of the time: &quot;It comes to you in a plain brown wrapper.&quot; Given that Krasnow had effectively poached the band from Buddah there were limitations on what material could be released. &quot;Strictly Personal&quot; was the result, contained in its enigmatically addressed parcel sleeve. The raft of material left behind eventually emerged, firstly on CD as &quot;I May Be Hungry, But I Sure Ain&#x27;t Weird&quot; and later on vinyl, implemented by John French, as &quot;It Comes To You in a Plain Brown Wrapper&quot; (which has two tracks that are missing from the former release). Both &quot;Blue Thumb&quot; and the stamps on the cover of &quot;Strictly Personal&quot; have LSD connotations, as does the track &quot;Ah Feel Like Ahcid&quot;, although Beefheart himself refuted this (claiming that this is a rendering of &quot;I feel like I said&quot;).

===&quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot;, 1969===

Critically acclaimed as Van Vliet&#x27;s magnum opus, &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot; was released as a 28-track double album in June 1969 on Frank Zappa&#x27;s newly formed Straight Records label. First issues, in the US, were auto-coupled and housed in the black &quot;Straight&quot; liners along with a 6-page lyric sheet illustrated by the Mascara Snake. A school-age portrait of Van Vliet appears on the front of this sheet, while the cover of the gatefold shows Beefheart in a modified Pilgrim hat, obscuring his face with the head of a fish. The fish is a carp – arguably a &quot;replica&quot; for a trout, photographed by Cal Schenkel. The inner spread &quot;infra-red&quot; photography is by Ed Caraeff, whose Beefheart vacuum cleaner images from this session also appear on Zappa&#x27;s &quot;Hot Rats&quot; release (a month earlier) to accompany &quot;Willie The Pimp&quot; lyrics sung by Vliet. Alex St. Clair had now left the band and, after Junior Madeo from the Blackouts was considered, the role was filled by Bill Harkleroad. Bassist Jerry Handley had also departed, with Gary Marker stepping in. Thus the long rehearsals for the album began in the house on Ensenada Drive in Woodland Hills, L.A. that would become the Magic Band House.

The Magic Band began recordings for &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot; with bassist Gary &quot;Magic&quot; Marker at T.T.G. (on &quot;Moonlight on Vermont&quot; and &quot;Veteran&#x27;s Day Poppy&quot;), but later enlisted bassist Mark Boston after his departure. The remainder of the album was recorded at Whitney Studios, with some field recordings made at the house. Boston was acquainted with French and Harkleroad via past bands. Van Vliet had also begun assigning nicknames to his band members, so Harkleroad became &quot;Zoot Horn Rollo&quot;, and Boston became &quot;Rockette Morton&quot;, while John French assumed the name &quot;Drumbo&quot;, and Jeff Cotton became &quot;Antennae Jimmy Semens&quot;. Van Vliet&#x27;s cousin Victor Hayden, &quot;the Mascara Snake&quot;, performed as a bass clarinetist later in the proceedings. Vliet&#x27;s girlfriend Laurie Stone, who can be heard laughing at the beginning of &quot;Fallin&#x27; Ditch&quot;, became an audio typist at the Magic Band house.

Van Vliet wanted the whole band to &quot;live&quot; the &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot; album. The group rehearsed Van Vliet&#x27;s difficult compositions for eight months, living communally in their small rented house in the Woodland Hills suburb of Los Angeles. With only two bedrooms in the house, band members would find sleep in various corners of one, while Vliet occupied the other, and rehearsals were accomplished in the main living area. Van Vliet implemented his vision by completely dominating his musicians, artistically and emotionally. At various times, one or another of the group members was &quot;put in the barrel&quot;, with Van Vliet berating him continually, sometimes for days, until the musician collapsed in tears or in total submission. Guitarist Bill Harkleroad complained that his fingers were a &quot;bloody mess&quot; as a result of Beefheart&#x27;s orders that he use heavy strings. Drummer John French described the situation as &quot;cultlike&quot; and a visiting friend said &quot;the environment in that house was positively Mansonesque&quot;. Their material circumstances were dire. With no income other than welfare and contributions from relatives, the group barely survived and were even arrested for shoplifting food (Zappa bailed them out). French has recalled living on no more than a small cup of beans a day for a month. A visitor described their appearance as &quot;cadaverous&quot; and said that &quot;they all looked in poor health&quot;. Band members were restricted from leaving the house and practiced for 14 or more hours a day.

John French&#x27;s 2010 book &quot;Through the Eyes of Magic&quot; describes some of the &quot;talks&quot;, which were initiated by his doing such things as playing a Frank Zappa drum part (&quot;The Blimp (mousetrapreplica)&quot;) in his drumming shed and not having finished drum parts as quickly as Beefheart wanted. French writes of being punched by band members, thrown into walls, kicked, punched in the face by Beefheart hard enough to draw blood, being attacked with a sharp broomstick. Eventually Beefheart, French says, threatened to throw him out an upper floor window. He admits complicity in similarly attacking his bandmates during &quot;talks&quot; aimed at them. In the end, after the album&#x27;s recording, Beefheart ejected French from the band by throwing him down a set of stairs, telling him to &quot;Take a walk, man&quot; after not responding in a desired manner to a request to &quot;play a strawberry&quot; on the drums. Beefheart replaced French with drummer Jeff Bruschel, an acquaintance of Hayden. Referred to as &quot;Fake Drumbo&quot; (playing on French&#x27;s drumset) this final act resulted in French&#x27;s name not appearing on the album credits, either as a player or arranger. Bruschel toured with the band to Europe but was replaced by the next recording.

According to Van Vliet, the 28 songs on the album were written in a single -hour session at the piano, an instrument he had no skill in playing, an approach Mike Barnes compared to John Cage&#x27;s &quot;maverick irreverence toward classical tradition&quot;, though band members have stated that the songs were written over the course of about a year, beginning around December 1967. (The band did watch Federico Fellini&#x27;s 1963 film &quot;8½&quot; during the creation of the album). It took the band about eight months to mold the songs into shape, with French bearing primary responsibility for transposing and shaping Vliet&#x27;s piano fragments into guitar and bass lines, which were mostly notated on paper. Harkleroad in 1998 said in retrospect: &quot;We&#x27;re dealing with a strange person, coming from a place of being a sculptor/painter, using music as his idiom. He was getting more into that part of who he was instead of this blues singer. The band had rehearsed the songs so thoroughly that the instrumental tracks for 21 of the songs were recorded in a single four-and-a-half-hour recording session. Van Vliet spent the next few days overdubbing the vocals. The album&#x27;s cover artwork was photographed and designed by Cal Schenkel and shows Van Vliet wearing the raw head of a carp, bought from a local fish market and fashioned into a mask by Schenkel.

&quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot; incorporated a wide variety of musical styles, including blues, avant garde/experimental, and rock. The relentless practice prior to recording blended the music into an iconoclastic whole of contrapuntal tempos, featuring slide guitar, polyrhythmic drumming (with French&#x27;s drums and cymbals covered in cardboard), honking saxophone and bass clarinet. Van Vliet&#x27;s vocals range from his signature Howlin&#x27; Wolf-inspired growl to frenzied falsetto to laconic, casual ramblings.

The instrumental backing was effectively recorded live in the studio, while Van Vliet overdubbed most of the vocals in only partial sync with the music by hearing the slight sound leakage through the studio window. Zappa said of Van Vliet&#x27;s approach, &quot;[it was] impossible to tell him why things should be such and such a way. It seemed to me that if he was going to create a unique object, that the best thing for me to do was to keep my mouth shut as much as possible and just let him do whatever he wanted to do whether I thought it was wrong or not.&quot;

Van Vliet used the ensuing publicity, particularly with a 1970 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview with Langdon Winner, to promulgate a number of myths that were subsequently quoted as fact. Winner&#x27;s article stated, for instance, that neither Van Vliet nor the members of the Magic Band ever took drugs, but Harkleroad later contradicted this. Van Vliet claimed to have taught both Harkleroad and Boston to play their instruments from scratch; in fact, the pair were already accomplished young musicians before joining the band. Lastly, Van Vliet claimed to have gone a year and half without sleeping. When asked how this was possible, he claimed to have only eaten fruit.

Critic Steve Huey of AllMusic writes that the album&#x27;s influence &quot;was felt more in spirit than in direct copycatting, as a catalyst rather than a literal musical starting point. However, its inspiring reimagining of what was possible in a rock context laid the groundwork for countless experiments in rock surrealism to follow, especially during the punk and new wave era.&quot; In 2003, the album was ranked sixtieth by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in their list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time: &quot;On first listen, &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot; sounds like raw Delta blues&quot;, with Beefheart &quot;singing and ranting and reciting poetry over fractured guitar licks. But the seeming sonic chaos is an illusion—to construct the songs, the Magic Band rehearsed twelve hours a day for months on end in a house with the windows blacked out. (Producer Frank Zappa was then able to record most of the album in less than five hours.) Tracks such as &#x27;Ella Guru&#x27; and &#x27;My Human Gets Me Blues&#x27; are the direct predecessors of modern musical primitives such as Tom Waits and PJ Harvey.&quot; Guitarist Fred Frith noted that during this process &quot;forces that usually emerge in improvisation are harnessed and made constant, repeatable&quot;.

Critic Robert Christgau gave the album a B+, saying, &quot;I find it impossible to give this record an A because it is just too weird. But I&#x27;d like to. Very great played at high volume when you&#x27;re feeling shitty, because you&#x27;ll never feel as shitty as this record.&quot; BBC disc jockey John Peel said of the album: &quot;If there has been anything in the history of popular music which could be described as a work of art in a way that people who are involved in other areas of art would understand, then &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot; is probably that work.&quot; It was inducted into the United States National Recording Registry in 2011.

===Later recordings, 1970–82===

====&quot;Lick My Decals Off, Baby&quot;====
&quot;Lick My Decals Off, Baby&quot; (1970) continued in a similarly experimental vein. An album with &quot;a very coherent structure&quot; in the Magic Band&#x27;s &quot;most experimental and visionary stage&quot;, it was Van Vliet&#x27;s most commercially successful in the United Kingdom, spending twenty weeks on the UK Albums Chart and peaking at number 20. An early promotional music video was made of its title song, and a bizarre television commercial was also filmed that included excerpts from &quot;Woe-Is-uh-Me-Bop&quot;, silent footage of masked Magic Band members using kitchen utensils as musical instruments, and Beefheart kicking over a bowl of what appears to be porridge onto a dividing stripe in the middle of a road. The video was rarely played but was accepted into the Museum of Modern Art, where it has been used in several programs related to music.

On this LP Art Tripp III, formerly of the Mothers of Invention, played drums and marimba, along with a returning John French. &quot;Lick My Decals Off, Baby&quot; was the first record on which the band was credited as &quot;&quot;The&quot; Magic Band, rather than &quot;His&quot;&quot; Magic Band. Journalist Irwin Chusid interprets this change as &quot;a grudging concession of its members&#x27; at least semiautonomous humanity&quot;. Robert Christgau gave the album an A−, commenting, &quot;Beefheart&#x27;s famous five-octave range and covert totalitarian structures have taken on a playful undertone, repulsive and engrossing and slapstick funny.&quot; Due to licensing disputes, &quot;Lick My Decals Off, Baby&quot; was unavailable on CD for many years, though it remained in print on vinyl. It was ranked second in &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine&#x27;s May 2010 list of &quot;The 50 Greatest Lost Albums&quot;. In 2011, the album became available for download on the iTunes Store.

He toured in 1970 with Ry Cooder on the bill to promote the album.

====&quot;The Spotlight Kid&quot; and &quot;Clear Spot&quot;====

The next two records, &quot;The Spotlight Kid&quot; (simply credited to &quot;Captain Beefheart&quot;) and &quot;Clear Spot&quot; (credited to &quot;Captain Beefheart and the Magic Band&quot;), were both released in 1972. The atmosphere of &quot;The Spotlight Kid&quot; is, according to one critic, &quot;definitely relaxed and fun, maybe one step up from a jam&quot;. And though &quot;things do sound maybe just a little too blasé&quot;, &quot;Beefheart at his worst still has something more than most groups at their best.&quot; The music is simpler and slower than on the group&#x27;s two previous releases, the uncompromisingly original &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot; and the frenetic &quot;Lick My Decals Off, Baby&quot;. This was in part an attempt by Van Vliet to become a more appealing commercial proposition as the band had made virtually no money during the previous two years—at the time of recording, the band members were subsisting on welfare food handouts and remittances from their parents. Van Vliet offered that he &quot;got tired of scaring people with what I was doing ... I realized that I had to give them something to hang their hat on, so I started working more of a beat into the music. It&#x27;s more human that way&quot;.

Magic Band members have also said that the slower performances were due in part to Van Vliet&#x27;s inability to fit his lyrics with the instrumental backing of the faster material on the earlier albums, a problem that was exacerbated in that he almost never rehearsed with the group. In the period leading up to the recording the band lived communally, first at a compound near Ben Lomond, California and then in northern California near Trinidad. The situation saw a return to the physical violence and psychological manipulation that had taken place during the band&#x27;s previous communal residence while composing and rehearsing &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot;. According to John French, the worst of this was directed toward Harkleroad. In his autobiography Harkleroad recalls being thrown into a dumpster, an act he interpreted as having metaphorical intent.

&quot;Clear Spot&quot; production credit of Ted Templeman made AllMusic&#x27;s Ned Raggett consider &quot;why in the world [it] wasn&#x27;t more of a commercial success than it was&quot;, and that while fans &quot;of the fully all-out side of Beefheart might find the end result not fully up to snuff as a result, but those less concerned with pushing back all borders all the time will enjoy his unexpected blend of everything tempered with a new accessibility&quot;. The review called the song &quot;Big Eyed Beans from Venus&quot; &quot;a fantastically strange piece of aggression&quot;. A &quot;Clear Spot&quot; song, &quot;Her Eyes Are A Blue Million Miles&quot;, appeared on the soundtrack of the Coen brothers&#x27; cult comedy film &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; (1998).

====&quot;Unconditionally Guaranteed&quot; and &quot;Bluejeans &amp; Moonbeams&quot;====
In 1974, immediately after the recording of &quot;Unconditionally Guaranteed&quot;, which markedly continued the trend towards a more commercial sound heard on some of the &quot;Clear Spot&quot; tracks, the Magic Band&#x27;s original members departed. The disgruntled former members worked together for a period, gigging at Blue Lake and putting together their own ideas and demos, with John French earmarked as the vocalist. These concepts eventually coalesced around the core of Art Tripp III, Harkleroad and Boston, with the formation of Mallard, helped by finance and UK recording facilities from Jethro Tull&#x27;s Ian Anderson. Some of French&#x27;s compositions were used in the band&#x27;s work, but the group&#x27;s singer was Sam Galpin and the role of keyboardist was eventually taken by John Thomas, who had shared a house with French in Eureka at the time. At this time Vliet attempted to recruit both French and Harkleroad as producers for his next album, but his pleas fell on deaf ears. Andy Di Martino produced both of these Virgin label albums.

Vliet was forced to quickly form a new Magic Band to complete support-tour dates, with studio musicians who had no experience with his music and in fact had never heard it. Having no knowledge of the previous Magic Band style, they simply improvised what they thought would go with each song, playing much slicker versions that have been described as &quot;bar band&quot; versions of Beefheart songs. A review described this incarnation of the Magic Band as the &quot;Tragic Band&quot;, a term that has stuck over the years. 
* Robert &#x27;Fuzzy&#x27; Fuscaldo – guitar
* Dean Smith – guitar
* Del Simmons – saxophone; flute
* Michael &#x27;Bucky&#x27; Smotherman – keyboards; vocals
* Paul Uhrig – bass
* Ty Grimes – drums
Mike Barnes said that the description of the new band &quot;grooving along pleasantly&quot;, was &quot;...an appropriately banal description of the music of a man who only a few years ago had composed with the express intent of shaking listeners out of their torpor.&quot; The one album they recorded, &quot;Bluejeans &amp; Moonbeams&quot; (1974) has, like its predecessor, a completely different, almost soft rock sound from any other Beefheart record. Neither was well received; drummer Art Tripp recalled that when he and the original Magic Band listened to &quot;Unconditionally Guaranteed&quot;, they &quot;...were horrified. As we listened, it was as though each song was worse than the one which preceded it&quot;. Beefheart later disowned both albums, calling them &quot;horrible and vulgar&quot;, asking that they not be considered part of his musical output and urging fans who bought them to &quot;take copies back for a refund&quot;.

====&quot;Bongo Fury&quot; and &quot;Bat Chain Puller&quot;====

By the fall of 1975 the band had completed their European tour, with further US dates in the New Year of 1976, supporting Zappa along with Dr. John. Van Vliet now found himself stuck in a web of contractual hang-ups. At this point Zappa had begun to extend a helping hand, with Vliet already having performed incognito as &quot;Rollin&#x27; Red&quot; on Zappa&#x27;s &quot;One Size Fits All&quot; (1975) and then joining with him on the &quot;Bongo Fury&quot; album and its later support tour. Two Vliet-penned numbers on the &quot;Bongo Fury&quot; album are &quot;Sam with the Showing Scalp Flat Top&quot; and &quot;Man with the Woman Head&quot;. The form, texture and imagery of this album&#x27;s first track, &quot;Debra Kadabra&quot;, sung by Vliet, has &#x27;angular similarities&#x27; to the work he would later produce in his next three albums. On the &quot;Bongo Fury&quot; album Vliet also sings &quot;Poofter&#x27;s Froth Wyoming Plans Ahead&quot;, harmonizes on &quot;200 Years Old&quot; and &quot;Muffin Man&quot;, and plays harmonica and soprano saxophone.

In early 1976 Zappa put on his producer hat and, once again, opened up his studio facilities and finance to Vliet. This was for the production of an album provisionally titled &quot;Bat Chain Puller&quot;. The band were John French (drums), John Thomas (keyboards) and Jeff Moris Tepper and Denny Walley (guitars). Much of the work on this album had been finalized and some demos had been circulated when fate once again struck the Beefheart camp. In May 1976 the long association between Zappa and his manager/business partner Herb Cohen ceased. This resulted in Zappa&#x27;s finances and ongoing works becoming part of protracted legal negotiations. The &quot;Bat Chain Puller&quot; project went &quot;on ice&quot; and did not see an official release until 2012. After this recording John Thomas joined ex-Magic Band members in Mallard.

Prior to his next album Beefheart appeared in 1977 on the Tubes&#x27; album &quot;Now&quot;, playing saxophone on the song &quot;Cathy&#x27;s Clone&quot;, and the album also featured a cover of the &quot;Clear Spot&quot; song &quot;My Head Is My Only House Unless It Rains&quot;. In 1978 he appeared on Jack Nitzsche&#x27;s soundtrack to the film &quot;Blue Collar&quot;.

====&quot;Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller)&quot;====
Having extricated himself from a mire of contractual difficulties Beefheart emerged with this new album, in 1978, on the Warner Bros label. &quot;Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller)&quot; contained re-workings of the shelved &quot;Bat Chain Puller&quot; album and still retained its original guitarist, Jeff Moris Tepper. However, he and Vliet were now joined by a whole new line-up of Richard Redus (guitar, bass and accordion), Eric Drew Feldman (bass, piano and synthesizer), Bruce Lambourne Fowler (trombone and air bass), Art Tripp (percussion and marimba) and Robert Arthur Williams (drums). The album was co-produced by Vliet with Pete Johnson. Members of this Magic Band and the &quot;Bat Chain&quot; elements would later feature on Beefheart&#x27;s last two albums.

&quot;Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller)&quot; was described by Ned Raggett of Allmusic to be &quot;...manna from heaven for those feeling Beefheart had lost his way on his two Mercury albums&quot;. Following Vliet&#x27;s death, John French claimed the 40-second spoken word track &quot;Apes-Ma&quot; to be an analogy of Van Vliet&#x27;s deteriorating physical condition. The album&#x27;s sleeve features Van Vliet&#x27;s 1976 painting &quot;Green Tom&quot;, one of the many works that would mark out his longed-for career as a painter of note.

====&quot;Doc at the Radar Station&quot;====

&quot;Doc at the Radar Station&quot; (1980) helped establish Beefheart&#x27;s late resurgence. Released by Virgin Records during the post-punk scene, the music was now accessible to a younger, more receptive audience. He was interviewed in a feature report on KABC-TV&#x27;s &quot;Channel 7 Eyewitness News&quot; in which he was hailed as &quot;the father of the new wave. One of the most important American composers of the last fifty years, [and] a primitive genius&quot;; Van Vliet said at this period, &quot;I&#x27;m doing a non-hypnotic music to break up the catatonic state ... and I think there is one right now.&quot;

Steve Huey of Allmusic cited the &quot;Doc at the Radar Station&quot; as being &quot;...generally acclaimed as the strongest album of his comeback, and by some as his best since &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot;&quot;, &quot;even if the Captain&#x27;s voice isn&#x27;t quite what it once was, &quot;Doc at the Radar Station&quot; is an excellent, focused consolidation of Beefheart&#x27;s past and then-present&quot;. Van Vliet&#x27;s biographer Mike Barnes writes of &quot;revamping work built on skeletal ideas and fragments that would have mouldered away in the vaults had they not been exhumed and transformed into full-blown, totally convincing new material&quot;. During this period, Van Vliet made two appearances on David Letterman&#x27;s late night television program on NBC, and also performed on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

Richard Redus and Art Tripp departed on this album, with slide guitar and marimba duties taken up by the reappearance of John French. The guitar skills of Gary Lucas also feature on the track &quot;Flavor Bud Living&quot;.

====&quot;Ice Cream for Crow&quot;====

The final Beefheart record, &quot;Ice Cream for Crow&quot; (1982), was recorded with Gary Lucas (who was also Van Vliet&#x27;s manager), Jeff Moris Tepper, Richard Snyder and Cliff Martinez. This line-up made a video to promote the title track, directed by Van Vliet and Ken Schreiber, with cinematography by Daniel Pearl, which was rejected by MTV for being &quot;too weird&quot;. However, the video was included in the Letterman broadcast on NBC-TV, and was also accepted into the Museum of Modern Art. Van Vliet announced &quot;I don&#x27;t want my MTV if they don&#x27;t want my video&quot; during his interview with Letterman, in reference to MTV&#x27;s &quot;I want my MTV&quot; marketing campaign of the time.

&quot;Ice Cream for Crow&quot;, along with songs such as its title track, features instrumental performances by the Magic Band with performance poetry readings by Van Vliet. Raggett of AllMusic called the album a &quot;last entertaining blast of wigginess from one of the few truly independent artists in late 20th century pop music, with humor, skill, and style all still intact&quot;, with the Magic Band &quot;turning out more choppy rhythms, unexpected guitar lines, and outré arrangements, Captain Beefheart lets everything run wild as always, with successful results&quot;. Barnes writes that, &quot;The most original and vital tracks (on the album) are the newer ones&quot;, and that it &quot;feels like an hors-d&#x27;oeuvre for a main course that never came&quot;. Michael Galucci of &quot;Goldmine&quot; praised the album, describing it as &quot;the single, most bizarre entry in Van Vliet&#x27;s long, odd career.&quot; Promotional work proposed to Beefheart by Virgin Records was as unorthodox as him making an appearance in the film &quot;Grizzly II: Revenge&quot;. Soon after, Van Vliet retired from music and began a new career as a painter. Gary Lucas tried to convince him to record one more album, but to no avail.

====&quot;Riding Some Kind of Unusual Skull Sleigh&quot;====
Released in 2004 by Rhino Handmade in a limited edition of 1,500 copies, this signed and numbered box set contains a &quot;Riding Some Kind of Unusual Skull Sleigh&quot; CD of Vliet-recited poetry, the Anton Corbijn film of Vliet &quot;Some YoYo Stuff&quot; on DVD and two art books. One book, entitled &quot;Splinters&quot;, gives a visual &quot;scrapbook&quot; insight into Vliet&#x27;s life, from an early age to his painting in retirement. The second, eponymously titled, book is packed with art pages of Vliet&#x27;s work. The first is bound in green linen, the second in yellow. These colors are counterpointed throughout the package, which comes in a green slipcase measuring 235 mm × 325 mm × 70 mm. An onion-skin wallet, nestling at the package&#x27;s inner sanctum, contains a matching-numbered Vliet lithograph on hand-rolled paper, signed by the artist. The two books are by publishers Artist Ink Editions.

===Paintings===
Throughout his musical career, Van Vliet remained interested in visual art. He placed his paintings, often reminiscent of Franz Kline, on several of his albums. In 1987, Van Vliet published &quot;Skeleton Breath, Scorpion Blush&quot;, a collection of his poetry, paintings and drawings.

In the mid-1980s, Van Vliet became reclusive and abandoned music, stating he had gotten &quot;too good at the horn&quot; and could make far more money painting. Beefheart&#x27;s first exhibition had been at Liverpool&#x27;s Bluecoat Gallery during the Magic Band&#x27;s 1972 tour of the UK. He was interviewed on Granada regional television standing in front of his bold black and white canvases. He was inspired to begin an art career when a fan, Julian Schnabel, who admired the artwork seen on his album covers, asked to buy a drawing from him. His debut exhibition as a serious painter was at the Mary Boone Gallery in New York in 1985 and was initially regarded as that of &quot;another rock musician dabbling in art for ego&#x27;s sake&quot;, though his primitive, non-conformist work has received more sympathetic and serious attention since then, with some sales approaching $25,000.

Two books have been published specifically devoted to critique and analysis of his artwork: &quot;Riding Some Kind of Unusual Skull Sleigh: On The Arts Of Don Van Vliet&quot; (1999) by W. C. Bamberger and &quot;Stand Up To Be Discontinued&quot;, first published in 1993, a now rare collection of essays on Van Vliet&#x27;s work. The limited edition version of the book contains a CD of Van Vliet reading six of his poems: &quot;Fallin&#x27; Ditch&quot;, &quot;The Tired Plain&quot;, &quot;Skeleton Makes Good&quot;, &quot;Safe Sex Drill&quot;, &quot;Tulip&quot; and &quot;Gill&quot;. A deluxe edition was published in 1994; only 60 were printed, with etchings of Van Vliet&#x27;s signature, costing £180.
In the early 1980s Van Vliet established an association with the Galerie Michael Werner in Cologne. Eric Drew Feldman stated later in an interview that at that time Michael Werner told Van Vliet he needed to stop playing music if he wanted to be respected as a painter, warning him that otherwise he would only be considered a &quot;musician who paints&quot;. In doing so, it was said that he had effectively &quot;succeeded in leaving his past behind&quot;. Van Vliet has been described as a modernist, a primitivist, an abstract expressionist, and, &quot;in a sense&quot; an outsider artist. Morgan Falconer of &quot;Artforum&quot; concurs, mentioning both a &quot;neo-primitivist aesthetic&quot; and further stating that his work is influenced by the CoBrA painters. The resemblance to the CoBrA painters is also recognized by art critic Roberto Ohrt, while others have compared his paintings to the work of Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline, Antonin Artaud, Francis Bacon, Vincent van Gogh and Mark Rothko.

According to Dr. John Lane, director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, in 1997, although Van Vliet&#x27;s work has associations with mainstream abstract expressionist painting, more importantly he was a self-taught artist and his painting &quot;has that same kind of edge the music has&quot;. Curator David Breuer asserts that in contrast to the busied, bohemian urban lives of the New York abstract expressionists, the rural desert environment Van Vliet was influenced by is a distinctly naturalistic one, making him a distinguished figure in contemporary art, whose work will survive in canon. Van Vliet stated of his own work, &quot;I&#x27;m trying to turn myself inside out on the canvas. I&#x27;m trying to completely bare what I think at that moment&quot; and &quot;I paint for the simple reason that I have to. I feel a sense of relief after I do.&quot; When asked about his artistic influences he stated that there were none. &quot;I just paint like I paint and that&#x27;s enough influence.&quot; He did however state his admiration of Georg Baselitz, the De Stijl artist Piet Mondrian, and Vincent van Gogh; after seeing van Gogh&#x27;s paintings in person, Van Vliet quoted himself as saying, &quot;The sun disappoints me so.&quot;

Exhibits of his paintings from the late 1990s were held in New York in 2009 and 2010. Falconer stated that the most recent exhibitions showed &quot;evidence of a serious, committed artist&quot;. It was claimed that he stopped painting in the late 1990s. A 2007 interview with Van Vliet through email by Anthony Haden-Guest, however, showed him to still be active artistically. He exhibited only few of his paintings because he immediately destroyed any that did not satisfy him.

===Life in retirement===

After his retirement from music, Van Vliet rarely appeared in public. He resided near Trinidad, California, with his wife Janet &quot;Jan&quot; Van Vliet. By the early 1990s, he was using a wheelchair as a result of multiple sclerosis. The severity of his illness was sometimes disputed. Many of his art contractors and friends considered him to be in good health. Other associates such as his longtime drummer and musical director John French and bassist Richard Snyder have stated that they had noticed symptoms consistent with the onset of multiple sclerosis, such as sensitivity to heat, loss of balance, and stiffness of gait, by the late 1970s.

One of Van Vliet&#x27;s last public appearances was in the 1993 short documentary &quot;Some Yo Yo Stuff&quot; by filmmaker Anton Corbijn, described as an &quot;observation of his observations&quot;. Around 13 minutes and shot entirely in black and white, with appearances by his mother and David Lynch, the film showed a noticeably weakened and dysarthric Van Vliet at his residence in California, reading poetry, and philosophically discussing his life, environment, music and art. In 2000, he appeared on Gary Lucas&#x27;s album &quot;Improve the Shining Hour&quot; and Moris Tepper&#x27;s &quot;Moth to Mouth&quot;, and spoke on Tepper&#x27;s 2004 song &quot;Ricochet Man&quot; from the album &quot;Head Off&quot;. He is credited for naming Tepper&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;A Singer Named Shotgun Throat&quot;.

Van Vliet often voiced concern over and support for environmentalist issues and causes, particularly the welfare of animals. He often referred to Earth as &quot;God&#x27;s Golfball&quot; and this expression can be found on a number of his later albums. In 2003 he was heard on the compilation album &quot;Where We Live: Stand for What You Stand On: A Benefit CD for EarthJustice&quot; singing a version of &quot;Happy Birthday to You&quot; retitled &quot;Happy Earthday&quot;. The track lasts 34 seconds and was recorded over the telephone.

===Death===
Van Vliet died at a hospital in Arcata, California, on Friday, December 17, 2010. The cause was named as complications from multiple sclerosis. Tom Waits and Kathleen Brennan commented on his death, praising him: &quot;Wondrous, secret ... and profound, he was a diviner of the highest order.&quot;

Dweezil Zappa dedicated the song &quot;Willie the Pimp&quot; to Beefheart at the &quot;Zappa Plays Zappa&quot; show at the Beacon Theatre in New York City on the day of his death, while Jeff Bridges exclaimed &quot;Rest in peace, Captain Beefheart!&quot; at the conclusion of the December 18, 2010, episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;.

==Relationship with Frank Zappa==

Van Vliet met Frank Zappa when they were both teenagers and shared an interest in rhythm and blues and Chicago blues. They collaborated from this early stage with Zappa&#x27;s scripts for &quot;teenage operettas&quot;, such as &quot;Captain Beefheart &amp; the Grunt People&quot;, helping to elevate Van Vliet&#x27;s Captain Beefheart persona. The earliest known recording of either Beefheart or Zappa is a collaboration between them, &quot;Lost in a Whirlpool&quot;, recorded around 1958/1959 and included on the posthumous Zappa album &quot;The Lost Episodes&quot; in 1996. In 1963, the pair recorded a demo at the Pal Recording Studio in Cucamonga as the Soots, seeking support from a major label. Their efforts were unsuccessful, as &quot;Beefheart&#x27;s Howlin&#x27; Wolf vocal style and Zappa&#x27;s distorted guitar&quot; were &quot;not on the agenda&quot; at the time.
The friendship between Zappa and Van Vliet over the years was sometimes expressed in the form of rivalry as musicians drifted back and forth between their groups. Van Vliet embarked on the 1975 &quot;Bongo Fury&quot; tour with Zappa and the Mothers, mainly because conflicting contractual obligations made him unable to tour or record independently. Their relationship grew acrimonious on the tour to the point that they refused to talk to one another. Zappa became irritated by Van Vliet, who drew constantly, including while on stage, filling one of his large sketch books with rapidly executed portraits and warped caricatures of Zappa. Musically, Van Vliet&#x27;s primitive style contrasted sharply with Zappa&#x27;s compositional discipline and abundant technique. Mothers of Invention drummer Jimmy Carl Black described the situation as &quot;two geniuses&quot; on &quot;ego trips&quot;. Estranged for years afterwards, they reconnected at the end of Zappa&#x27;s life, after his diagnosis with terminal prostate cancer.

Their collaborative work appears on the Zappa rarity collections &quot;The Lost Episodes&quot; (1996) and &quot;Mystery Disc&quot; (1996). Particularly notable is their song &quot;Muffin Man&quot;, included on &quot;Bongo Fury&quot;, as well as Zappa&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Strictly Commercial&quot; (1995). Zappa finished concerts with the song for many years afterwards. Beefheart also provided vocals for &quot;Willie the Pimp&quot; on Zappa&#x27;s otherwise instrumental album &quot;Hot Rats&quot; (1969). One track on &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot;, &quot;The Blimp (mousetrapreplica)&quot;, features Magic Band guitarist Jeff Cotton talking on the telephone to Zappa superimposed onto an unrelated live recording of the Mothers of Invention (the backing track was later released in 1992 as &quot;Charles Ives&quot; on &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 5&quot; ). Van Vliet also played the harmonica on two songs on Zappa albums: &quot;San Ber&#x27;dino&quot; (credited as &quot;Bloodshot Rollin&#x27; Red&quot;) on &quot;One Size Fits All&quot; (1975) and &quot;Find Her Finer&quot; on &quot;Zoot Allures&quot; (1976). He is also the vocalist on &quot;The Torture Never Stops (Original Version)&quot; on Zappa&#x27;s &quot;You Can&#x27;t Do That on Stage Anymore, Vol. 4&quot;.
==The Magic Band==

The Magic Band was the backing band of Captain Beefheart between 1967 and 1982. The rotating lineup featured dozens of performers, many of whom became known by nicknames given to them by Beefheart. Ex-members of the Magic Band formed the short-lived group Mallard in 1974.

==Musical style==
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; wrote that &quot;The crucial problem in [Captain] Beefheart’s career has been that few people have ever been able to accept him for what he is&quot;; a blues and rock musician, his management referred to him as &quot;potentially the greatest white blues singer of all time&quot;, while a combination of managers, other musicians, fans and critics felt that he should have either sung more clearly and softly, made more commercial music or played &quot;blues songs that people could understand and dance to&quot;. As a teenager, he listened heavily to two genres of music, Mississippi Delta blues, and avant-garde jazz, the latter of which included John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman and Cecil Taylor, which shaped his music style. He adapted to and pushed the boundaries of genre throughout his career. According to &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, his music &quot;drew on blues, jazz, psychedelia, and a thousand other subgenres&quot;. &quot;The Independent&quot; described his music as a fusion of rhythm and blues and avant-garde jazz. &quot;Far Out&quot; magazine said that his &quot;combination of jazz, blues and psychedelic rock&quot; defied categorization, and as a result of his difficult to place style, many simply referred to it as avant-garde. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Beefheart’s brand of abrasive blues-rock was truly a novelty to young listeners in 1964&quot;. &quot;Popular Song in the 20th Century: Styles and Singers and What They Said About America&quot; included him among the prominent progressive rock musicians of the 1960s and &#x27;70s.

John Parish described Captain Beefheart&#x27;s music as a &quot;combination of raw blues and abstract jazz. There was humour in there, but you could tell that it wasn&#x27;t [intended as] a joke. I felt that there was a depth to what he did that very few other rock artists have managed [to achieve].&quot; A &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; biography described his work as &quot;a sort of modern chamber music for rock band, since he plans every note and teaches the band their parts by ear.&quot; The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; describes Beefheart&#x27;s songs as conveying &quot;deep distrust of modern civilization, a yearning for ecological balance, and the belief that all animals in the wild are far superior to human beings&quot;. Barret Hansen, in a review of Captain Beefheart&#x27;s &quot;Strictly Personal&quot; album, described the singer as &quot;the only white voice that has come close to capturing what Charley Patton and Son House are all about&quot;.

Captain Beefheart was a pioneer of art rock and experimental rock. His music has been cited as an influence on punk rock, post-punk and new wave music, and Captain Beefheart himself has sometimes been classified as a proto-punk musician.

==Legacy==
Van Vliet has been the subject of at least two documentaries, the BBC&#x27;s 1997 &quot;The Artist Formerly Known as Captain Beefheart&quot; narrated by John Peel, and the 2006 independent production &quot;Captain Beefheart: Under Review&quot;.

According to Peel, &quot;If there has ever been such a thing as a genius in the history of popular music, it&#x27;s Beefheart ... I heard echoes of his music in some of the records I listened to last week and I&#x27;ll hear more echoes in records that I listen to this week.&quot; His narration added: &quot;A psychedelic shaman who frequently bullied his musicians and sometimes alarmed his fans, Don somehow remained one of rock&#x27;s great innocents.&quot; Mike Barnes referred to him as an &quot;iconic counterculture hero&quot; who, with the Magic Band, &quot;went on to stake out startling new possibilities for rock music&quot;. Lester Bangs cited Beefheart as &quot;one of the four or five unqualified geniuses to rise from the hothouses of American music in the Sixties&quot;, while John Harris of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised the music&#x27;s &quot;pulses with energy and ideas, the strange way the spluttering instruments meld together&quot;. A &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; biography said that because his work &quot;breaks so many of rock&#x27;s conventions at once, Beefheart&#x27;s music has always been more influential than popular.&quot; In this context, it is performed by the classical group, the Meridian Arts Ensemble. Far Out (magazine) cites the music of Captain Beefheart as laying &quot;the groundwork for post-punk, new wave, and no wave, allowing the likes of Brian Eno and David Bowie to pick up from where Beefheart had left off&quot;.

Many artists have cited Van Vliet as an influence, beginning with the Edgar Broughton Band, who covered &quot;Dropout Boogie&quot; as Apache Drop Out (mixed with the Shadows&#x27; &quot;Apache&quot;) as early as 1970, as did the Kills 32 years later. Minutemen were fans of Beefheart, and were arguably among the few to effectively synthesize his music with their own, especially in their early output, which featured disjointed guitar and irregular, galloping rhythms. Michael Azerrad describes the Minutemen&#x27;s early output as &quot;highly caffeinated Captain Beefheart running down James Brown tunes&quot;, and notes that Beefheart was the group&#x27;s &quot;idol&quot;. Others who arguably conveyed the same influence around the same time or before include John Cale of the Velvet Underground, Little Feat, Laurie Anderson, the Residents and Henry Cow. Genesis P-Orridge of Throbbing Gristle and Psychic TV, and poet mystic Z&#x27;EV, both pioneers of industrial music, cited Van Vliet along with Zappa among their influences. More notable were those emerging during the early days of punk rock, such as the Clash and John Lydon of the Sex Pistols (reportedly to manager Malcolm McLaren&#x27;s disapproval), later of the post-punk band Public Image Ltd. Frank Discussion of punk rock band the Feederz learned to play guitar from listening to &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot; and &quot;Lick My Decals Off, Baby&quot;.

Cartoonist and writer Matt Groening tells of listening to &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot; at the age of 15 and thinking &quot;that it was the worst thing I&#x27;d ever heard. I said to myself, they&#x27;re not even trying! It was just a sloppy cacophony. Then I listened to it a couple more times, because I couldn&#x27;t believe Frank Zappa could do this to me—and because a double album cost a lot of money. About the third time, I realised they were doing it on purpose; they meant it to sound exactly this way. About the sixth or seventh time, it clicked in, and I thought it was the greatest album I&#x27;d ever heard.&quot; Groening first saw Beefheart and the Magic Band perform in the front row at the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall in the early 1970s. He later declared &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot; to be the greatest album ever made. He considered the appeal of the Magic Band as outcasts who were even &quot;too weird for the hippies&quot;. Groening served as the curator of the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival that reunited the post–Beefheart Magic Band.

Van Vliet&#x27;s influence on post–punk bands was demonstrated by Magazine&#x27;s recording of &quot;I Love You You Big Dummy&quot; in 1978 and the tribute album &quot;Fast &#x27;n&#x27; Bulbous – A Tribute to Captain Beefheart&quot; in 1988, featuring the likes of artists such as the Dog Faced Hermans, the Scientists, the Membranes, Simon Fisher Turner, That Petrol Emotion, the Primevals, the Mock Turtles, XTC, and Sonic Youth, who included a cover of Beefheart&#x27;s &quot;Electricity&quot; which would later be re-released as a bonus track on the deluxe edition of their 1988 album &quot;Daydream Nation&quot;. Other post-punk bands influenced by Beefheart include Gang of Four, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Pere Ubu, Babe the Blue Ox and Mark E. Smith of the Fall, who covered &quot;Beatle Bones &#x27;N&#x27; Smokin&#x27; Stones&quot; in their 1993 session for John Peel. Beefheart is considered to have &quot;greatly influenced&quot; new wave artists, such as David Byrne of Talking Heads, Blondie, Devo, the Bongos, and the B-52s.

Tom Waits&#x27; shift in artistic direction, starting with 1983&#x27;s &quot;Swordfishtrombones&quot;, was, Waits claims, a result of his wife Kathleen Brennan introducing him to Van Vliet&#x27;s music. &quot;Once you&#x27;ve heard Beefheart&quot;, said Waits, &quot;it&#x27;s hard to wash him out of your clothes. It stains, like coffee or blood.&quot; More recently, Waits has described Beefheart&#x27;s work as a &quot;glimpse into the future; like curatives, recipes for ancient oils&quot;. Guitarist John Frusciante of the Red Hot Chili Peppers cited Van Vliet as a prominent influence on the band&#x27;s 1991 album &quot;Blood Sugar Sex Magik&quot; as well as his debut solo album &quot;Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt&quot; (1994) and stated that during his drug-induced absence, after leaving the Red Hot Chili Peppers, he &quot;would paint and listen to &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot;&quot;. Black Francis of the Pixies cited Beefheart&#x27;s &quot;The Spotlight Kid&quot; as one of the albums he listened to regularly when first writing songs for the band, and Kurt Cobain of Nirvana acknowledged Van Vliet&#x27;s influence, mentioning him among his notoriously eclectic range.

The White Stripes in 2000 released a 7&quot; tribute single, &quot;Party of Special Things to Do&quot;, containing covers of that Beefheart song plus &quot;China Pig&quot; and &quot;Ashtray Heart&quot;. The Kills included a cover of &quot;Dropout Boogie&quot; on their debut &quot;Black Rooster EP&quot; (2002). The Black Keys in 2008 released a free cover of Beefheart&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Glad&quot; from &quot;Safe as Milk&quot;. The LCD Soundsystem song &quot;Losing My Edge&quot; has a verse which James Murphy says, &quot;I was there when Captain Beefheart started up his first band&quot;. In 2005, Genus Records produced &quot;Mama Kangaroos – Philly Women Sing Captain Beefheart&quot;, a 20-track tribute to Captain Beefheart. Beck included &quot;Safe as Milk&quot; and &quot;Ella Guru&quot; in a playlist of songs as part of his website&#x27;s &quot;Planned Obsolescence&quot; series of mashups of songs by the musicians that influenced him. Franz Ferdinand cited Beefheart&#x27;s &quot;Doc at the Radar Station&quot; as a strong influence on their second LP, &quot;You Could Have It So Much Better.&quot; Placebo briefly named themselves Ashtray Heart, after the track on &quot;Doc at the Radar Station&quot;; the band&#x27;s album &quot;Battle for the Sun&quot; contains the track, &quot;Ashtray Heart&quot;. Joan Osborne covered Beefheart&#x27;s &quot;(His) Eyes Are a Blue Million Miles&quot;, which appears on &quot;Early Recordings&quot;. She cited Van Vliet as one of her influences.

PJ Harvey and John Parish discussed Beefheart&#x27;s influence in an interview together. Harvey&#x27;s first experience of Beefheart&#x27;s music was as a child. Her parents had all of his albums; listening to them made her &quot;feel ill&quot;. Harvey was reintroduced to Beefheart&#x27;s music by Parish, who lent her a cassette copy of &quot;Shiny Beast (Bat Chain Puller)&quot; at the age of 16. She cited him as one of her greatest influences since. Ty Segall covered &quot;Drop Out Boogie&quot; on his 2009 album &quot;Lemons&quot;.

<text>JPEG 2000 (JP2) is an image compression standard and coding system. It was developed from 1997 to 2000 by a Joint Photographic Experts Group committee chaired by Touradj Ebrahimi (later the JPEG president), with the intention of superseding their original JPEG standard (created in 1992), which is based on a discrete cosine transform (DCT), with a newly designed, wavelet-based method. The standardized filename extension is .jp2 for ISO/IEC 15444-1 conforming files and .jpx for the extended part-2 specifications, published as ISO/IEC 15444-2. The MIME types for JPEG 2000 are defined in RFC 3745. The MIME type for JPEG 2000 (ISO/IEC 15444-1) is image/jp2.

The JPEG 2000 project was motivated by Ricoh&#x27;s submission in 1995 of the CREW (Compression with Reversible Embedded Wavelets) algorithm to the standardization effort of JPEG-LS. Ultimately the LOCO-I algorithm was selected as the basis for JPEG-LS, but many of the features of CREW ended up in the JPEG 2000 standard.

JPEG 2000 codestreams are regions of interest that offer several mechanisms to support spatial random access or region of interest access at varying degrees of granularity. It is possible to store different parts of the same picture using different quality.

JPEG 2000 is a compression standard based on a discrete wavelet transform (DWT). The standard could be adapted for motion imaging video compression with the Motion JPEG 2000 extension. JPEG 2000 technology was selected as the video coding standard for digital cinema in 2004. However, JPEG 2000 is generally not supported in web browsers for web pages and hence is not generally used on the World Wide Web. Nevertheless, for those with PDF support, web browsers generally support JPEG 2000 in PDFs.

==Design goals==
While there is a modest increase in compression performance of JPEG 2000 compared to JPEG, the main advantage offered by JPEG 2000 is the significant flexibility of the codestream. The codestream obtained after compression of an image with JPEG 2000 is scalable in nature, meaning that it can be decoded in a number of ways; for instance, by truncating the codestream at any point, one may obtain a representation of the image at a lower resolution, or signal-to-noise ratio – see scalable compression. By ordering the codestream in various ways, applications can achieve significant performance increases. However, as a consequence of this flexibility, JPEG 2000 requires codecs that are complex and computationally demanding. Another difference, in comparison with JPEG, is in terms of visual artifacts: JPEG 2000 only produces ringing artifacts, manifested as blur and rings near edges in the image, while JPEG produces both ringing artifacts and &#x27;blocking&#x27; artifacts, due to its 8×8 blocks.

JPEG 2000 has been published as an ISO standard, ISO/IEC 15444. The cost of obtaining all documents for the standard has been estimated at 2,718CHF (US$2,720 as of 2015).

===Applications===
Notable markets and applications intended to be served by the standard include:
* Consumer applications such as multimedia devices (e.g. digital cameras, personal digital assistants, 3G mobile phones, color facsimile, printers, scanners)
* Client/server communication (e.g. the Internet, image database, video streaming, video server)
* Military/surveillance (e.g. HD satellite images, Motion detection, network distribution and storage)
* Medical imagery, specifically the DICOM specifications for medical data interchange.
* Biometrics
* Remote sensing
* High-quality frame-based video recording, editing and storage.
* Live HDTV feed contribution (I-frame only video compression with low transmission latency), such as live HDTV feed of a sport event linked to the TV station studio
* Digital cinema, such as Digital Cinema Package
* Digitized Audio-visual contents and images for long term digital preservation
* World Meteorological Organization has built JPEG 2000 Compression into the new GRIB2 file format. The GRIB file structure is designed for global distribution of meteorological data. The implementation of JPEG 2000 compression in GRIB2 has reduced file sizes up to 80%.

==Improvements over the 1992 JPEG standard==
===Multiple resolution representation===
JPEG 2000 decomposes the image into a multiple resolution representation in the course of its compression process. This pyramid representation can be put to use for other image presentation purposes beyond compression.

===Progressive transmission by pixel and resolution accuracy===
These features are more commonly known as &quot;progressive decoding&quot; and &quot;signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scalability&quot;. JPEG 2000 provides efficient codestream organizations which are progressive by pixel accuracy and by image resolution (or by image size). This allows the viewer to see a lower quality version of the final picture before the whole file has been downloaded. The quality improves progressively as more data is downloaded from the source.

===Choice of lossless or lossy compression===
Like the Lossless JPEG standard, the JPEG 2000 standard provides both lossless and lossy compression in a single compression architecture. Lossless compression is provided by the use of a reversible integer wavelet transform in JPEG 2000.

===Error resilience===
Like JPEG 1992, JPEG 2000 is robust to bit errors introduced by noisy communication channels, due to the coding of data in relatively small independent blocks.

===Flexible file format===
The JP2 and JPX file formats allow for handling of color-space information, metadata, and for interactivity in networked applications as developed in the JPEG Part 9 JPIP protocol.

===High dynamic range support===
JPEG 2000 supports bit depths of 1 to 38 bits per component. Supported color spaces include monochrome, 3 types of YCbCr, sRGB, PhotoYCC, CMY(K), YCCK and CIELab. It also later added support for CIEJab (CIECAM02), e-sRGB, ROMM, YPbPr and others.

===Side channel spatial information===
Full support for transparency and alpha planes.

==JPEG 2000 image coding system – Parts==
The JPEG 2000 image coding system (ISO/IEC 15444) consists of the following parts:

==Technical discussion==
The aim of JPEG 2000 is not only improving compression performance over JPEG but also adding (or improving) features such as scalability and editability. JPEG 2000&#x27;s improvement in compression performance relative to the original JPEG standard is actually rather modest and should not ordinarily be the primary consideration for evaluating the design. Very low and very high compression rates are supported in JPEG 2000. The ability of the design to handle a very large range of effective bit rates is one of the strengths of JPEG 2000. For example, to reduce the number of bits for a picture below a certain amount, the advisable thing to do with the first JPEG standard is to reduce the resolution of the input image before encoding it. That is unnecessary when using JPEG 2000, because JPEG 2000 already does this automatically through its multi-resolution decomposition structure. The following sections describe the algorithm of JPEG 2000.

According to the Royal Library of the Netherlands, &quot;the current JP2 format specification leaves room for multiple interpretations when it comes to the support of ICC profiles, and the handling of grid resolution information&quot;.

===Color components transformation===
Initially images have to be transformed from the RGB color space to another color space, leading to three &quot;components&quot; that are handled separately. There are two possible choices:
# Irreversible Color Transform (ICT) uses the well known BT.601 YCC color space. It is called &quot;irreversible&quot; because it has to be implemented in floating or fix-point and causes round-off errors. The ICT shall be used only with the 9/7 wavelet transform.
# Reversible Color Transform (RCT) uses a modified YUV color space (almost the same as YCC) that does not introduce quantization errors, so it is fully reversible. Proper implementation of the RCT requires that numbers be rounded as specified and cannot be expressed exactly in matrix form. The RCT shall be used only with the 5/3 wavelet transform. The transformations are:
::formula_1
If R, G, and B are normalized to the same precision, then numeric precision of C and C is one bit greater than the precision of the original components. This increase in precision is necessary to ensure reversibility. The chrominance components can be, but do not necessarily have to be, downscaled in resolution; in fact, since the wavelet transformation already separates images into scales, downsampling is more effectively handled by dropping the finest wavelet scale. This step is called &quot;multiple component transformation&quot; in the JPEG 2000 language since its usage is not restricted to the RGB color model.

===Tiling===
After color transformation, the image is split into so-called &quot;tiles&quot;, rectangular regions of the image that are transformed and encoded separately. Tiles can be any size, and it is also possible to consider the whole image as one single tile. Once the size is chosen, all the tiles will have the same size (except optionally those on the right and bottom borders). Dividing the image into tiles is advantageous in that the decoder will need less memory to decode the image and it can opt to decode only selected tiles to achieve a partial decoding of the image. The disadvantage of this approach is that the quality of the picture decreases due to a lower peak signal-to-noise ratio. Using many tiles can create a blocking effect similar to the older JPEG 1992 standard.

===Wavelet transform===

These tiles are then wavelet-transformed to an arbitrary depth, in contrast to JPEG 1992 which uses an 8×8 block-size discrete cosine transform. JPEG 2000 uses two different wavelet transforms:

# &quot;irreversible&quot;: the CDF 9/7 wavelet transform (developed by Ingrid Daubechies). It is said to be &quot;irreversible&quot; because it introduces quantization noise that depends on the precision of the decoder.
# &quot;reversible&quot;: a rounded version of the biorthogonal Le Gall–Tabatabai (LGT) 5/3 wavelet transform (developed by Didier Le Gall and Ali J. Tabatabai). It uses only integer coefficients, so the output does not require rounding (quantization) and so it does not introduce any quantization noise. It is used in lossless coding.

The wavelet transforms are implemented by the lifting scheme or by convolution.

===Quantization===
After the wavelet transform, the coefficients are scalar-quantized to reduce the number of bits to represent them, at the expense of quality. The output is a set of integer numbers which have to be encoded bit-by-bit. The parameter that can be changed to set the final quality is the quantization step: the greater the step, the greater is the compression and the loss of quality. With a quantization step that equals 1, no quantization is performed (it is used in lossless compression).

===Coding===

The result of the previous process is a collection of &quot;sub-bands&quot; which represent several approximation scales. A sub-band is a set of &quot;coefficients&quot;—real numbers which represent aspects of the image associated with a certain frequency range as well as a spatial area of the image.

The quantized sub-bands are split further into &quot;precincts&quot;, rectangular regions in the wavelet domain. They are typically sized so that they provide an efficient way to access only part of the (reconstructed) image, though this is not a requirement.

Precincts are split further into &quot;code blocks&quot;. Code blocks are in a single sub-band and have equal sizes—except those located at the edges of the image. The encoder has to encode the bits of all quantized coefficients of a code block, starting with the most significant bits and progressing to less significant bits by a process called the &quot;EBCOT&quot; scheme. &quot;EBCOT&quot; here stands for &quot;Embedded Block Coding with Optimal Truncation&quot;. In this encoding process, each bit plane of the code block gets encoded in three so-called &quot;coding passes&quot;, first encoding bits (and signs) of insignificant coefficients with significant neighbors (i.e., with 1-bits in higher bit planes), then refinement bits of significant coefficients and finally coefficients without significant neighbors. The three passes are called &quot;Significance Propagation&quot;, &quot;Magnitude Refinement&quot; and &quot;Cleanup&quot; pass, respectively.

In lossless mode all bit planes have to be encoded by the EBCOT, and no bit planes can be dropped.

The bits selected by these coding passes then get encoded by a context-driven binary arithmetic coder, namely the binary MQ-coder (as also employed by JBIG2). The context of a coefficient is formed by the state of its eight neighbors in the code block.

The result is a bit-stream that is split into &quot;packets&quot; where a &quot;packet&quot; groups selected passes of all code blocks from a precinct into one indivisible unit. Packets are the key to quality scalability (i.e., packets containing less significant bits can be discarded to achieve lower bit rates and higher distortion).

Packets from all sub-bands are then collected in so-called &quot;layers&quot;.
The way the packets are built up from the code-block coding passes, and thus which packets a layer will contain, is not defined by the JPEG 2000 standard, but in general a codec will try to build layers in such a way that the image quality will increase monotonically with each layer, and the image distortion will shrink from layer to layer. Thus, layers define the progression by image quality within the codestream.

The problem is now to find the optimal packet length for all code blocks which minimizes the overall distortion in a way that the generated target bitrate equals the demanded bit rate.

While the standard does not define a procedure as to how to perform this form of rate–distortion optimization, the general outline is given in one of its many appendices: For each bit encoded by the EBCOT coder, the improvement in image quality, defined as mean square error, gets measured; this can be implemented by an easy table-lookup algorithm. Furthermore, the length of the resulting codestream gets measured. This forms for each code block a graph in the rate–distortion plane, giving image quality over bitstream length. The optimal selection for the truncation points, thus for the packet-build-up points is then given by defining critical &quot;slopes&quot; of these curves, and picking all those coding passes whose curve in the rate–distortion graph is steeper than the given critical slope. This method can be seen as a special application of the method of &quot;Lagrange multiplier&quot; which is used for optimization problems under constraints. The Lagrange multiplier, typically denoted by λ, turns out to be the critical slope, the constraint is the demanded target bitrate, and the value to optimize is the overall distortion.

Packets can be reordered almost arbitrarily in the JPEG 2000 bit-stream; this gives the encoder as well as image servers a high degree of freedom.

Already encoded images can be sent over networks with arbitrary bit rates by using a layer-progressive encoding order. On the other hand, color components can be moved back in the bit-stream; lower resolutions (corresponding to low-frequency sub-bands) could be sent first for image previewing. Finally, spatial browsing of large images is possible through appropriate tile or partition selection. All these operations do not require any re-encoding but only byte-wise copy operations.

===Compression ratio===

Compared to the previous JPEG standard, JPEG 2000 delivers a typical compression gain in the range of 20%, depending on the image characteristics. Higher-resolution images tend to benefit more, where JPEG 2000&#x27;s spatial-redundancy prediction can contribute more to the compression process. In very low-bitrate applications, studies have shown JPEG 2000 to be outperformed by the intra-frame coding mode of H.264.

===Computational complexity and performance===
JPEG 2000 is much more complicated in terms of computational complexity in comparison with JPEG standard. Tiling, color component transform, discrete wavelet transform, and quantization could be done pretty fast, though entropy codec is time-consuming and quite complicated. EBCOT context modelling and arithmetic MQ-coder take most of the time of JPEG 2000 codec.

On CPU the main idea of getting fast JPEG 2000 encoding and decoding is closely connected with AVX/SSE and multithreading to process each tile in a separate thread. The fastest JPEG 2000 solutions utilize both CPU and GPU power to get high performance benchmarks.

==File format and codestream==
Similar to JPEG-1, JPEG 2000 defines both a file format and a codestream. Whereas JPEG 2000 entirely describes the image samples, JPEG-1 includes additional meta-information such as the resolution of the image or the color space that has been used to encode the image. JPEG 2000 images should—if stored as files—be boxed in the JPEG 2000 file format, where they get the .jp2 extension. The part-2 extension to JPEG 2000 (ISO/IEC 15444-2) enriches the file format by including mechanisms for animation or composition of several codestreams into one single image. This extended file format is called JPX, and should use the file extension .jpf, although .jpx is also used.

There is no standardized extension for codestream data because codestream data is not to be considered to be stored in files in the first place, though when done for testing purposes, the extension .jpc, .j2k or .j2c is commonly used.

==Metadata==
For traditional JPEG, additional metadata, e.g. lighting and exposure conditions, is kept in an application marker in the Exif format specified by the JEITA. JPEG 2000 chooses a different route, encoding the same metadata in XML form. The reference between the Exif tags and the XML elements is standardized by the ISO TC42 committee in the standard 12234-1.4.

Extensible Metadata Platform can also be embedded in JPEG 2000.

==Legal status==
ISO 15444 is covered by patents and the specification lists 17 patent holders, but the contributing companies and organizations agreed that licenses for its first part—the core coding system—can be obtained free of charge from all contributors. But this is not a formal guarantee. License and royalties may be required to use some extensions.

The JPEG committee has stated:

However, the JPEG committee acknowledged in 2004 that undeclared submarine patents may present a hazard:

In ISO/IEC 15444-1:2016, the JPEG committee stated in &quot;Annex L: Patent statement&quot;:

==Related standards==
Several additional parts of the JPEG 2000 standard exist; amongst them are ISO/IEC 15444-2:2000, JPEG 2000 extensions defining the .jpx file format, featuring for example Trellis quantization, an extended file format and additional color spaces, ISO/IEC 15444-4:2000, the reference testing and ISO/IEC 15444-6:2000, the compound image file format (.jpm), allowing compression of compound text/image graphics.

Extensions for secure image transfer, &quot;JPSEC&quot; (ISO/IEC 15444-8), enhanced error-correction schemes for wireless applications, &quot;JPWL&quot; (ISO/IEC 15444-11) and extensions for encoding of volumetric images, &quot;JP3D&quot; (ISO/IEC 15444-10) are also already available from the ISO.

===JPIP protocol for streaming JPEG 2000 images===
In 2005, a JPEG 2000–based image browsing protocol, called JPIP was published as ISO/IEC 15444-9. Within this framework, only selected regions of potentially huge images have to be transmitted from an image server on the request of a client, thus reducing the required bandwidth.

JPEG 2000 data may also be streamed using the ECWP and ECWPS protocols found within the ERDAS ECW/JP2 SDK.

===Motion JPEG 2000===

Motion JPEG 2000, (MJ2), originally defined in Part 3 of the ISO Standard for JPEG2000 (ISO/IEC 15444-3:2002,) as a standalone document, has now been expressed by ISO/IEC 15444-3:2002/Amd 2:2003 in terms of the ISO Base format, ISO/IEC 15444-12 and in ITU-T Recommendation T.802. It specifies the use of the JPEG 2000 format for timed sequences of images (motion sequences), possibly combined with audio, and composed into an overall presentation. It also defines a file format, based on ISO base media file format (ISO 15444-12). Filename extensions for Motion JPEG 2000 video files are .mj2 and .mjp2 according to RFC 3745.

It is an open ISO standard and an advanced update to MJPEG (or MJ), which was based on the legacy JPEG format. Unlike common video formats, such as MPEG-4 Part 2, WMV, and H.264, MJ2 does not employ temporal or inter-frame compression. Instead, each frame is an independent entity encoded by either a lossy or lossless variant of JPEG 2000. Its physical structure does not depend on time ordering, but it does employ a separate profile to complement the data. For audio, it supports LPCM encoding, as well as various MPEG-4 variants, as &quot;raw&quot; or complement data.

Motion JPEG 2000 (often referenced as MJ2 or MJP2) is considered as a digital archival format by the Library of Congress though MXF_OP1a_JP2_LL (lossless JPEG 2000 wrapped in MXF operational pattern 1a) is preferred by the LOC Packard Campus for Audio-Visual Conservation.

===ISO base media file format===
ISO/IEC 15444-12 is identical with ISO/IEC 14496-12 (MPEG-4 Part 12) and it defines ISO base media file format. For example, Motion JPEG 2000 file format, MP4 file format or 3GP file format are also based on this ISO base media file format.

===GML JP2 georeferencing===
The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) has defined a metadata standard for georeferencing JPEG 2000 images with embedded XML using the Geography Markup Language (GML) format: &quot;GML in JPEG 2000 for Geographic Imagery Encoding (GMLJP2)&quot;, version 1.0.0, dated 2006-01-18. Version 2.0, entitled &quot;GML in JPEG 2000 (GMLJP2) Encoding Standard Part 1: Core&quot; was approved 2014-06-30.

JP2 and JPX files containing GMLJP2 markup can be located and displayed in the correct position on the Earth&#x27;s surface by a suitable Geographic Information System (GIS), in a similar way to GeoTIFF and GTG images.

<text>The 1420s BC is a decade which lasted from 1429 BC to 1420 BC.
== Events and Trends ==
* The Egyptian Empire signs a peace treaty with the Kingdom of Mitanni (approximately 1420s BC). Pharaoh Thutmose IV marries Mutemwiya, daughter of the Mitanni king Artatama I, and recognizes their borders. Both kings frequently refer to one another as &#x27;beloved brothers&#x27;, and grant one another great gifts.
* Crete changed into the Mycenae civilization (approximately 1420s BC)—start of the Mycenaean period.

==Significant people==
* Thutmose III, pharaoh of the eighteenth dynasty of Egypt (1503 BC–1426 BC)
* Thutmose IV, pharaoh of Egypt, (1401 BC–1391 BC or 1397 BC–1388 BC)
* Amenhotep II, pharaoh of Egypt, (1427 BC–1401 BC)

==Events and trends==
* Battle of Megiddo (15th century BC) between Thutmose III and a coalition under the King of Kadesh. It is the first battle to have been recorded in what is accepted as relatively reliable detail. The battle took place in year 23 I Shemsu day 20 (or possibly day 21). The exact year depends on the year Thutmose ascended to the throne of Egypt and among scholars the estimates range from 1479 to 1504 BCE. Using the 1479 BCE estimate the battle could have taken place in May 1457 BCE.
* 1451 BCE—According to James Ussher&#x27;s chronology, this is when the Israelites entered the Promised Land.

<text>Václav Havel (; 5 October 193618 December 2011) was a Czech statesman, author, poet, playwright, and dissident. Havel served as the last president of Czechoslovakia from 1989 until 1992, prior to the dissolution of Czechoslovakia on 31 December, before he became the first president of the Czech Republic from 1993 to 2003. He was the first democratically elected president of either country after the fall of communism. As a writer of Czech literature, he is known for his plays, essays and memoirs.

His educational opportunities having been limited by his bourgeois background, when freedoms were limited by the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, Havel first rose to prominence as a playwright. In works such as &quot;The Garden Party&quot; and &quot;The Memorandum&quot;, Havel used an absurdist style to criticize the Communist system. After participating in the Prague Spring and being blacklisted after the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, he became more politically active and helped found several dissident initiatives, including Charter 77 and the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted. His political activities brought him under the surveillance of the StB secret police, and he spent multiple periods as a political prisoner, the longest of his imprisoned terms being nearly four years, between 1979 and 1983.

Havel&#x27;s Civic Forum party played a major role in the Velvet Revolution that toppled the Communist system in Czechoslovakia in 1989. He assumed the presidency shortly thereafter, and was re-elected in a landslide the following year and after Slovak independence in 1993. Havel was instrumental in dismantling the Warsaw Pact and enlargement of NATO membership eastward. Many of his stances and policies, such as his opposition to Slovak independence, condemnation of the treatment of Sudeten Germans and their mass expulsion from Czechoslovakia after World War II, as well as granting of general amnesty to all those imprisoned under the Communist era, were very controversial domestically. By the end of his presidency, he enjoyed greater popularity abroad than at home. Havel continued his life as a public intellectual after his presidency, launching several initiatives including the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism, the VIZE 97 Foundation, and the Forum 2000 annual conference.

Havel&#x27;s political philosophy was one of anti-consumerism, humanitarianism, environmentalism, civil activism, and direct democracy. He supported the Czech Green Party from 2004 until his death. He received numerous accolades during his lifetime, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Gandhi Peace Prize, the Philadelphia Liberty Medal, the Order of Canada, the Four Freedoms Award, the Ambassador of Conscience Award, and the Hanno R. Ellenbogen Citizenship Award. The 2012–2013 academic year at the College of Europe was named in his honour. He is considered by some to be one of the most important intellectuals of the 20th century. The international airport in Prague was renamed Václav Havel Airport Prague in 2012.

==Early life==
Havel was born in Prague on 5 October 1936 into a wealthy family celebrated in Czechoslovakia for its entrepreneurial and cultural accomplishments. His grandfather, Vácslav Havel, a real estate developer, built a landmark entertainment complex on Prague&#x27;s Wenceslas Square. His father, Václav Maria Havel, was the real estate developer behind the suburban Barrandov Terraces, located on the highest point of Prague—next door to which his uncle, Miloš Havel, built one of the largest film studios in Europe. Havel&#x27;s mother, Božena Vavrečková, also came from an influential family; her father was a Czechoslovak ambassador and a well-known journalist.
In the early 1950s, because of his class background, Havel entered into a four-year apprenticeship as a chemical laboratory assistant and simultaneously took evening classes at a gymnasium. He completed his secondary education in 1954.

For political reasons, he was not accepted into any post-secondary school with a humanities program; therefore, he opted for studies at the Faculty of Economics of the Czech Technical University in Prague but dropped out after two years. On 9 July 1964, Havel married Olga Šplíchalová.

==Early theatre career==

The intellectual tradition of his family was essential for Havel&#x27;s lifetime adherence to the humanitarian values of the Czech culture. After finishing his military service (1957–59), Havel had to bring his intellectual ambitions in line with the given circumstances, especially with the restrictions imposed on him as a descendant of a bourgeois family. He found employment in Prague&#x27;s theatre world as a stagehand at Prague&#x27;s Theatre ABC – &quot;Divadlo ABC&quot;, and then at the Theatre on Balustrade – &quot;Divadlo Na zábradlí&quot;. Simultaneously, he was a student of dramatic arts by correspondence at the Theatre Faculty of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague (DAMU). His first own full-length play performed in public, besides various vaudeville collaborations, was &quot;The Garden Party&quot; (1963). Presented in a series of Theatre of the Absurd, at the Theatre on Balustrade, this play won him international acclaim. The play was soon followed by &quot;The Memorandum&quot;, one of his best known plays, and &quot;The Increased Difficulty of Concentration&quot;, all at the Theatre on Balustrade. In 1968, &quot;The Memorandum&quot; was also brought to The Public Theater in New York, which helped to establish Havel&#x27;s reputation in the United States. The Public Theater continued to produce his plays in the following years. After 1968, Havel&#x27;s plays were banned from the theatre world in his own country, and he was unable to leave Czechoslovakia to see any foreign performances of his works.

==Political dissident==

During the first week of the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968, Havel assisted the resistance by providing an on-air narrative via Radio Free Czechoslovakia station (at Liberec). Following the suppression of the Prague Spring in 1968, he was banned from the theatre and became more politically active. He took a job at Krakonoš brewery in Trutnov, an experience he wrote about in his play &quot;Audience&quot;. This play, along with two other &quot;Vaněk&quot; plays (so-called because of the recurring character Ferdinand Vaněk, a stand in for Havel), became distributed in samizdat form across Czechoslovakia, and greatly added to Havel&#x27;s reputation of being a leading dissident (several other Czech writers later wrote their own plays featuring Vaněk). This reputation was cemented with the publication of the &quot;Charter 77&quot; manifesto, written partially in response to the imprisonment of members of the Czech psychedelic rock band The Plastic People of the Universe; Havel had attended their trial, which centered on the group&#x27;s non-conformity in having long hair, using obscenities in their music, and their overall involvement in the Prague underground movement. Havel co-founded the Committee for the Defense of the Unjustly Prosecuted in 1979. His political activities resulted in multiple imprisonments by the authorities, and constant government surveillance and questioning by the secret police (Státní bezpečnost). His longest period in prison, from May 1979 to February 1983, is documented in letters to his wife that were later published as &quot;Letters to Olga&quot;.

He was known for his essays, most particularly &quot;The Power of the Powerless&quot; (1978), in which he described a societal paradigm in which citizens were forced to &quot;live within a lie&quot; under the Communist regime. In describing his role as a dissident, Havel wrote in 1979: &quot;we never decided to become dissidents. We have been transformed into them, without quite knowing how, sometimes we have ended up in prison without precisely knowing how. We simply went ahead and did certain things that we felt we ought to do, and that seemed to us decent to do, nothing more nor less.&quot;

Samuel Beckett&#x27;s 1982 short play, &quot;Catastrophe&quot;, was dedicated to Havel while he was held as a political prisoner in Czechoslovakia. Havel wrote the short play &quot;Mistake&quot; in response to Beckett. Both plays were published by Index on Censorship, which in 2022 requested a followup play on similar themes from the Iranian playwright Reza Shirmarz.

==Presidency==

On 29 December 1989, while he was leader of the Civic Forum, Havel became President of Czechoslovakia by a unanimous vote of the Federal Assembly. He had long insisted that he was not interested in politics and had argued that political change in the country should be induced through autonomous civic initiatives rather than through the official institutions. In 1990, soon after his election, Havel was awarded the Prize For Freedom of the Liberal International.

In 1990, Czechoslovakia held its first free elections in 44 years, resulting in a sweeping victory for Civic Forum and its Slovak counterpart, Public Against Violence. Between them, they commanded strong majorities in both houses of the legislature, and tallied the highest popular vote share recorded for a free election in the country. Havel retained his presidency.

Despite increasing political tensions between the Czechs and the Slovaks in 1992, Havel supported the retention of the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic prior to the dissolution of the country. Havel sought re-election in 1992. Although no other candidate filed, when the vote came on 3 July, he failed to get a majority due to a lack of support from Slovak deputies. The largest Czech political party, the Civic Democratic Party, let it be known that it would not support any other candidate. After the Slovaks issued their Declaration of Independence, he resigned as president on 20 July, saying that he would not preside over the country&#x27;s breakup.

However, when the Czech Republic was created as one of two successor states, he stood for election as its first president on 26 January 1993, and won. Although he was nominally the new country&#x27;s chief executive, the framers of the Constitution of the Czech Republic intended to vest most of the real power in the prime minister. However, owing to his prestige, he still commanded great moral authority, and the presidency acquired a greater role than the framers intended. For instance, largely due to his influence, the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia (KSCM), successor to the KSC&#x27;s branch in the Czech Lands, was kept on the margins for most of his presidency. Havel suspected that the KSCM was still an unreformed Stalinist party.

Havel&#x27;s popularity abroad surpassed his popularity at home, and he was often the object of controversy and criticism. During his time in office, Havel stated that the expulsion of the indigenous Sudeten German population after World War II was immoral, causing a great controversy at home. He also extended general amnesty as one of his first acts as president, in an attempt to lessen the pressure in overcrowded prisons as well as to release political prisoners and persons who may have been falsely imprisoned during the Communist era. Havel felt that many of the decisions by the previous regime&#x27;s courts should not be trusted, and that most of those in prison had not received fair trials. However, critics claimed that this amnesty led to a significant increase in the crime rate: the total number of crimes doubled, as did the number of murders. Several of the worst crimes in the history of the Czech criminology were committed by criminals released in this amnesty. Within four years of the Velvet Revolution (and following another two amnesties declared by Havel), criminality had more than tripled since 1989. According to Havel&#x27;s memoir &quot;To the Castle and Back&quot;, most of those who were released had less than a year to serve before their sentences ended, but statistics contradict Havel&#x27;s claims.

In an interview with Karel Hvížďala (included in &quot;To the Castle and Back&quot;), Havel expressed his feeling that it was his most important accomplishment as president to have contributed to the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact. According to his statement the dissolution was very complicated. The infrastructure created by the Warsaw Pact was part of the economies of all member states, and the Pact&#x27;s dissolution necessitated restructuring that took many years to complete. Furthermore, it took time to dismantle the Warsaw Pact&#x27;s institutions; for example, it took two years for Soviet troops to fully withdraw from Czechoslovakia.
Following a legal dispute with his sister-in-law Dagmar Havlová (wife of his brother Ivan M. Havel), Havel decided to sell his 50% stake in the Lucerna Palace on Wenceslas Square in Prague, built from 1907 to 1921 by his grandfather, also named Václav Havel (spelled Vácslav,) one of the multifunctional &quot;palaces&quot; in the center of the once booming pre-World War II Prague. In a transaction arranged by Marián Čalfa, Havel sold the estate to Václav Junek, a former Communist spy in France and head of the soon-to-be bankrupt conglomerate Chemapol Group, who later openly admitted that he bribed politicians of the Czech Social Democratic Party.

His close friend was Ivan Medek, who became the chief of the president&#x27;s office.

In January 1996, Olga Havlová, his wife of 32 years, died of cancer at 62. In December 1996, Havel who had been a chain smoker for a long time, was diagnosed with lung cancer. The disease reappeared two years later. He quit smoking. In 1997, he remarried, to actress Dagmar Veškrnová.

Havel was among those influential politicians who contributed most to the transition of NATO from being an anti-Warsaw Pact alliance to its present form. Havel advocated vigorously for the inclusion of former-Warsaw Pact members, like the Czech Republic, into the Western alliance.

Havel was re-elected president in 1998. He had to undergo a colostomy in Innsbruck when his colon ruptured while he was on holiday in Austria. 

On 30 January 2003, Havel signed &quot;The letter of the eight&quot; supporting planned U.S. invasion of Iraq. 

Havel left office after his second term as Czech president ended on 2 February 2003. Václav Klaus, one of his greatest political adversaries, was elected his successor as president on 28 February 2003. Margaret Thatcher wrote of the two men in her foreign policy treatise , reserving the greater respect for Havel. Havel&#x27;s dedication to democracy and his steadfast opposition to communist ideology earned him admiration.

==Post-presidential career==
Beginning in 1997, Havel hosted Forum 2000, an annual conference to &quot;identify the key issues facing civilisation and to explore ways to prevent the escalation of conflicts that have religion, culture or ethnicity as their primary components&quot;. In 2005, the former president occupied the Kluge Chair for Modern Culture at the John W. Kluge Center of the United States Library of Congress, where he continued his research on human rights. In November and December 2006, Havel spent eight weeks as a visiting artist in residence at Columbia University. The stay was sponsored by the Columbia Arts Initiative and featured &quot;performances, and panels centr[ing] on his life and ideas&quot;, including a public &quot;conversation&quot; with former U.S. President Bill Clinton. Concurrently, the Untitled Theater Company No. 61 launched a Havel Festival, the first complete festival of his plays in various venues throughout New York City, including The Brick Theater and the Ohio Theatre, in celebration of his 70th birthday. Havel was a member of the World Future Society and addressed the Society&#x27;s members on 4 July 1994. His speech was later printed in THE FUTURIST magazine (July 1995).

Havel was greatly admired by Czech citizens. In the poll taken for the 2005 TV show &quot;Největší Čech&quot; (the Czech spin-off of the BBC &quot;100 Greatest Britons&quot;), Havel placed third.

Havel&#x27;s memoir of his experience as president, &quot;To the Castle and Back&quot;, was published in May 2007. The book mixes an interview in the style of &quot;Disturbing the Peace&quot; with actual memoranda he sent to his staff and modern diary entries and recollections.

On 4 August 2007, Havel met with members of the Belarus Free Theatre at his summer cottage in the Czech Republic in a show of his continuing support, which has been instrumental in the theatre&#x27;s attaining international recognition and membership in the European Theatrical Convention.

Havel went on a hunger strike in 2007 to support Kurdish doctor and human rights activist Yekta Uzunoglu in his legal battle. A former president going on a hunger strike to support the legal battle of a foreigner in his country was a first in world history.

Havel&#x27;s first new play in almost two decades, &quot;Leaving&quot;, was published in November 2007, and was to have had its world premiere in June 2008 at the Prague Vinohrady Theatre, but the theater withdrew it in December as it felt it could not provide the technical support needed to mount the play. The play instead premiered on 22 May 2008 at the Archa Theatre to standing ovations. Havel based the play on &quot;King Lear&quot;, by William Shakespeare, and on &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;, by Anton Chekhov; &quot;Chancellor Vilém Rieger is the central character of &quot;Leaving&quot;, who faces a crisis after being removed from political power.&quot; The play had its English language premiere at the Orange Tree Theatre in London and its American premiere at The Wilma Theater in Philadelphia. Havel subsequently directed a film version of the play, which premiered in the Czech Republic on 22 March 2011.

Other works included the short sketch &quot;Pět Tet&quot;, a modern sequel to &quot;Unveiling&quot;, and &quot;The Pig, or Václav Havel&#x27;s Hunt for a Pig&quot;, which was premiered in Brno at Theatre Goose on a String and had its English language premiere at the 3LD Art &amp; Technology Center in New York, in a production from Untitled Theater Company No. 61, in a production workshopped in the Ice Factory Festival in 2011 and later revived as a full production in 2014, becoming a &quot;New York Times&quot; Critic&#x27;s Pick.

In 2008, Havel became a Member of the European Council on Tolerance and Reconciliation. He met U.S. President Barack Obama in private before Obama&#x27;s departure after the end of the European Union (EU) and United States (US) summit in Prague in April 2009. Havel was the chair of the Human Rights Foundation&#x27;s International Council and a member of the international advisory council of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation.

Havel was a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system. From the 1980s, Havel supported the green politics movement, partly due to his friendship with the co-founder of the German Alliance 90/The Greens party Milan Horáček. From 2004 until his death, he supported the Czech Green Party.

==Death==

A week before his death, he met with his long-time friend, the Dalai Lama, in Prague; Havel appeared in a wheelchair. He died in the morning of 18 December 2011, at the age of 75, at his country home in Hrádeček.

Prime Minister Petr Nečas announced a three-day mourning period from 21 to 23 December, the date announced by President Václav Klaus for the state funeral. The funeral Mass was held at Saint Vitus Cathedral, celebrated by the Archbishop of Prague Dominik Duka and Havel&#x27;s old friend Bishop Václav Malý. During the service, a 21 gun salute was fired in the former president&#x27;s honour, and in accordance with the family&#x27;s request, a private ceremony followed at Prague&#x27;s Strašnice Crematorium. Havel&#x27;s ashes were placed in the family tomb in the Vinohrady Cemetery in Prague. On 23 December 2011, the Václav Havel Tribute Concert was held in Prague&#x27;s Palác Lucerna.

===Reactions===
Within hours Havel&#x27;s death was met with numerous tributes, including from U.S. President Barack Obama, British Prime Minister David Cameron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former Polish President Lech Wałęsa. Merkel called Havel &quot;a great European&quot;, while Wałęsa said he should have been given the Nobel Peace Prize. The Russian Embassy sent an official condolence on behalf of the President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Slovakia declared 23 December a day of national mourning.

At the news of his death, former U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, a native of Czechoslovakia, said, &quot;He was one of the great figures of the 20th Century&quot;, while Czech expatriate novelist Milan Kundera said: &quot;Václav Havel&#x27;s most important work is his own life.&quot; Leader of Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia, Vojtěch Filip, stated that Havel was a very controversial person and that his words often conflicted with his deeds. He criticized Havel for having supported the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, repeating the charge that Havel had called the event a &quot;humanitarian bombing&quot;, although Havel had expressly and emphatically denied ever using such a phrase.

An online petition organized by one of the best-known Czech and Slovak film directors, Fero Fenič, calling on the government and the Parliament to rename Prague Ruzyně Airport to Václav Havel International Airport attracted—in a week after 20 December 2011—support of over 80,000 Czech Republic and foreign signatories. It was announced that the airport would be renamed the Václav Havel Airport Prague on 5 October 2012.

Reviewing a new biography by Michael Žantovský, Yale historian Marci Shore summarized his challenges as president: &quot;Havel&#x27;s message, &#x27;We are all responsible, we are all guilty,&#x27; was not popular. He enacted a general amnesty for all but the most serious criminals, apologized on behalf of Czechoslovakia for the post-World War II expulsion of the Sudeten Germans and resisted demands for a more draconian purge of secret police collaborators. These things were not popular either. And as the government undertook privatization and restitution, Havel confronted pyramid schemes, financial corruption and robber baron capitalism. He saw his country fall apart (if bloodlessly), becoming in 1993 the Czech Republic and Slovakia.&quot;

==Awards==
In 1986, Havel received the Erasmus Prize, in 1989 the Friedenspreis des Deutschen Buchhandels, and in 1990, he received the Gottlieb Duttweiler Prize for his outstanding contributions to the well-being of the wider community. In the same year he received the Freedom medal.

In 1993, he was elected an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.

On 4 July 1994, Václav Havel was awarded the Philadelphia Liberty Medal. In his acceptance speech, he said: &quot;The idea of human rights and freedoms must be an integral part of any meaningful world order. Yet I think it must be anchored in a different place, and in a different way, than has been the case so far. If it is to be more than just a slogan mocked by half the world, it cannot be expressed in the language of departing era, and it must not be mere froth floating on the subsiding waters of faith in a purely scientific relationship to the world.&quot;

Havel was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1995.

In 1997, Havel received &quot;ex aequo&quot; the Prince of Asturias Award for Communication and Humanities and the Prix mondial Cino Del Duca.

In 1998, the jury of the Europe Theatre Prize awarded him a special prize by the President Jack Lang.

In 2001, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In 2002, he was the third recipient of the Hanno R. Ellenbogen Citizenship Award presented by the Prague Society for International Cooperation. In 2003, he was awarded the International Gandhi Peace Prize by the government of India for his outstanding contribution towards world peace and upholding human rights in most difficult situations through Gandhian means; he was the inaugural recipient of Amnesty International&#x27;s Ambassador of Conscience Award for his work in promoting human rights; he received the US Presidential Medal of Freedom; and he was appointed as an honorary Companion of the Order of Canada.
In 2008 he was also awarded the Giuseppe Motta Medal for support for peace and democracy. As a former Czech President, Havel was a member of the Club of Madrid. In 2009 he was awarded the Quadriga Award, but decided to return it in 2011 following the announcement of Vladimir Putin as one of the 2011 award recipients.

Havel also received multiple honorary doctorates from various universities such as the prestigious Institut d&#x27;études politiques de Paris (Sciences Po) in 2009, and was a Foreign Associate Member of the French from October 1992 until his death.

On 10 October 2011, Havel was awarded by the Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili with the St. George Victory Order. In November 2014, he became only the fourth non-American honored with a bust in the U.S. Capitol.

===Václav Havel Bench===
The Václav Havel Bench (Havel&#x27;s Place) is an artistic and urban utility project, created by Czech architect and designer Bořek Šípek. It is composed of two wooden garden chairs connected by a round table, which has a hole inside. A linden, the Czech national tree, is growing through this hole. These benches can be found in many Czech towns as well as in some foreign locations such as Washington, D.C., Dublin, Lisbon, and Barcelona.

===Sculptures and busts===
On 19 November 2014, a bust of Havel, created by Czech-American artist Lubomír Janečka, was unveiled at the U.S. Congress, commemorating the 25-year anniversary of the Velvet Revolution. Havel is the fourth European ever to be honored by having a bust of himself in the U.S. Congress, after Winston Churchill, Raoul Wallenberg and Lajos Kossuth. Another sculpture of Havel is placed in a boardroom of Leinster House in Dublin, the historical seat of the Oireachtas, the Irish National Parliament.

On 22 June 2017 a statue of Václav Havel created by Georgian sculptor Jumber Jikia was unveiled in Tbilisi, Georgia.

<text>Jaroslav Seifert (; 23 September 1901 – 10 January 1986) was a Czech writer, poet and journalist. Seifert was awarded the 1984 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for his poetry which endowed with freshness, sensuality and rich inventiveness provides a liberating image of the indomitable spirit and versatility of man&quot;.

==Biography==
Born in Žižkov, a suburb of Prague in what was then part of Austria-Hungary, Seifert&#x27;s first collection of poems was published in 1921. He was a member of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ), the editor of a number of communist newspapers and magazines – &quot;Rovnost&quot;, &quot;Sršatec&quot;, and &quot;Reflektor&quot; – and the employee of a communist publishing house.

During the 1920s he was considered a leading representative of the Czechoslovak artistic avant-garde. He was one of the founders of the journal &quot;Devětsil&quot;. In March 1929, he and six other writers left the KSČ after signing a manifesto protesting against Bolshevized Stalinist-influenced tendencies in the new leadership of the party. He subsequently worked as a journalist in the social-democratic and trade union press during the 1930s and 1940s.

In 1949 Seifert left journalism and began to devote himself exclusively to literature. His poetry was awarded important state prizes in 1936, 1955, and 1968, and in 1967 he was designated National Artist. He was the official Chairman of the Czechoslovak Writer&#x27;s Union for several years (1968–70). In 1977 he was one of the signatories of Charter 77 in opposition to the government of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic.

Seifert was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1984. Due to bad health, he was not present at the award ceremony, and so his daughter accepted the Nobel Prize in his name. Even though it was a matter of great importance, there was only a brief remark of the award in the state-controlled media. He died on 10 January 1986, aged 84.

He was buried in the family tomb in Kralupy nad Vltavou. His burial was marked by a high presence of the communist secret police, the StB, who tried to suppress any hint of dissent on the part of mourners.

<doc id="63310" wikidata="Q219170" url="?curid=63310" title="Day of the Dead (1985 film)">
<text>Day of the Dead is a 1985 American post-apocalyptic zombie horror film written and directed by George A. Romero, and produced by Richard P. Rubinstein. The third film in Romero&#x27;s &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; series, it stars Lori Cardille, Terry Alexander, Joseph Pilato, Jarlath Conroy and Richard Liberty as members of a group of survivors of a zombie apocalypse sheltering in an underground bunker in Florida, where they must determine the outcome of humanity&#x27;s conflict with the undead horde. Romero described the film as a &quot;tragedy about how a lack of human communication causes chaos and collapse even in this small little pie slice of society&quot;.

Work on &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; began shortly after the release of the previous film in the series, &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; (1978), but was halted when Romero began work on other projects. It was developed as part of a three-film deal with that film&#x27;s distributor, United Film Distribution Company (UFDC); Romero elected to make the two other projects outlined in the deal, &quot;Knightriders&quot; (1981) and &quot;Creepshow&quot; (1982), first. Although the filmmaker was given final cut privilege, the screenplay was rewritten multiple times due to UFDC&#x27;s concerns that Romero&#x27;s ambitious original vision ― which he described as &quot;the &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; of zombie films&quot; ― would need to be shot with the intention of receiving an R rating from the Motion Picture Association of America to ensure its commercial viability; Romero elected to make the film on a lower budget and release it without a rating. &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; was filmed in fall 1984, with above-ground scenes in the cities of Fort Myers and Sanibel and underground scenes near Wampum, Pennsylvania. Tom Savini returned to provide the film&#x27;s special make-up effects; he was assisted by a team of artists that included Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger, who later became known for their work on the television series &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;.

&quot;Day of the Dead&quot; premiered at Hicksville, New York on June 30, 1985, and grossed $34 million worldwide against a budget of approximately $4 million. Although the make-up effects were praised, the film initially did not match the critical and commercial success of its predecessors; the series did not see another installment until the 2005 release of &quot;Land of the Dead&quot;. Reception of the film has improved with time, and Romero deemed it to be his personal favorite film in the original &quot;Dead&quot; trilogy. Like its predecessors, &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; has garnered a cult following and inspired numerous parodies and homages.

The film was remade twice: the first is the 2008 film of the same name, and the second is &quot;Day of the Dead: Bloodline&quot; (2017). A television series named after the film began airing on Syfy in 2021, while a stand-alone sequel, &quot;Night of the Living Dead II&quot;, was reported to be in active development.

==Plot==
Seven Years after the events in &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;, the zombie apocalypse has ravaged the entire world. The societal structures that used to safeguard civilization have mostly vanished, leaving the scattered remnants of human survivors vastly outnumbered by the zombie populations. A handful of scientists and soldiers live within a secure underground missile bunker in the Everglades. The scientists are trying to find a solution to the zombie pandemic; the soldiers have been assigned to protect them. Dr. Sarah Bowman, her lover and soldier Private Miguel Salazar, radio operator Bill McDermott, and helicopter pilot John fly from their underground base to Fort Myers in an attempt to locate additional survivors. They find only a large horde of the undead and return to the base, where they are told that the military detachment&#x27;s officer-in-charge Major Cooper has died. Sarah becomes concerned over Miguel&#x27;s worsening mental state, but he lashes out at her until she stops trying to help him.

Dr. Logan, the lead scientist (nicknamed &quot;Frankenstein&quot; by the soldiers because of his grisly surgical dissections of the zombies), believes that the undead plague victims can be made docile and domesticated through training and conditioning. He keeps a collection of captive undead for use as test subjects in a large underground corral in the compound. Sarah vehemently opposes Logan&#x27;s conditioning research; instead, she wants to search for a possible cure for the virus. Sarah discovers that Logan has been experimenting on the corpses of the dead soldiers, including Major Cooper. Fearful that the other soldiers will turn on them, Sarah reluctantly keeps this a secret.

The soldiers range from decent and workmanlike to mean-spirited and confrontational, especially the unstable Captain Rhodes. Rhodes vehemently objects to the dangers involved in capturing and maintaining zombie specimens, and tension between soldiers and scientists worsens in the face of dwindling supplies, the loss of communication with other survivors, and slow, uncertain progress in the research. During a meeting, Rhodes declares that he is establishing martial law under his command in the compound. He only grants the scientists &quot;some&quot; time to prove results and declares that he will execute anyone who interferes with his leadership. He also threatens to abandon the scientists and leave the compound, cutting off their protection from the undead hordes, though he cannot rebut Logan&#x27;s sarcastic asides that the soldiers have nowhere to run to and no way to stop the zombies on their own.

Disturbed by Rhodes&#x27; threats, Sarah discusses the situation with John and Bill, who reside in an RV at the far end of the tunnels and bluntly tell her they don&#x27;t believe in anything she and the scientists are trying to accomplish. John professes his conviction that the zombie plague is a form of divine retribution against mankind, and suggests that the three of them should take the helicopter, abandon the soldiers, and fly to a desert island somewhere where they could live off the land and start a new life. Logan hopes to secure Rhodes&#x27; goodwill by showing him the results of his research. He is especially proud of &quot;Bub&quot;, a docile zombie who remembers some parts of his past life and engages in rudimentary human behavior. Rhodes, however, is not impressed and loses more patience with the scientists.

During a zombie roundup procedure, a zombie escapes its harness when Miguel loses his focus, resulting in the deaths of soldiers Miller and Johnson. Miguel snaps and attempts to kill the creature, but another zombie bites him on the arm. With John and Bill&#x27;s help, Sarah amputates and cauterizes Miguel&#x27;s arm to stop the infection. Rhodes calls off the experiments and demands that all captive zombies be destroyed, as well as denying any further help from him and his remaining men.

Sarah and Bill later go to the operating theater to gather medical supplies for Miguel, where they find that Logan has been experimenting on Miller and Johnson&#x27;s remains. After discovering evidence that Logan has drifted into insanity due to his failure to civilize the zombies&#x27; baser instincts, Bill decides that they should leave in the helicopter immediately. Rhodes finds out that Logan has been feeding the flesh of his dead soldiers to Bub as positive reinforcement for his behavior. Furious, Rhodes kills Logan and seizes the remaining scientists and non-military personnel, stripping them of their weapons. Rhodes attempts to force John to fly him and his remaining soldiers away from the base, which John refuses to do. In response, Rhodes kills Logan&#x27;s assistant Dr. Fisher, locks Sarah and Bill inside the zombie corral, and orders Private Steel to beat John into submission.

Back in the laboratory, Bub uses his newly developed intelligence to free himself from his chain restraints and later discovers Logan&#x27;s corpse. In a display of human emotion, he mourns the loss of his instructor, then picks up a pistol and goes in search of revenge. Meanwhile Miguel, whose self-control has finally snapped, heads off to the surface. While the soldiers try to go after him, John knocks out Rhodes and Torrez, steals their guns, and goes into the zombie corral to rescue Sarah and Bill.

Outside, a suicidal Miguel opens the perimeter fence, letting in hundreds of zombies, which surround him on the missile elevator platform. As they begin tearing at him, he activates the elevator control box, lowering the ravenous zombies into the complex. As the undead swarm the bunker, Rhodes leaves his men behind to be killed. Chased by Bub, he desperately attempts to escape, but runs into a mass of zombies and is shot in the stomach by Bub, who mockingly salutes Rhodes as he is torn apart. John, Sarah, and Bill make it to the chopper and escape to a tropical island.

==Production==
===Development===
Romero originally intended the film to be &quot;the &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; of zombie films&quot;. Following budget disputes and the artistic need to release the film unrated, the budget of the film was cut in half, dropping from $7 million to $3.5 million. This forced Romero to scale back his story, rewriting the script and adjusting his original vision to fit the smaller budget.

A total of five scripts were written as Romero wrestled with the film&#x27;s concepts and the budgetary constraints. The first draft was over 200 pages, which he later condensed to a shorter page count. This is the true original script, and to date no copies of it have come to light. This version was likely rejected because UFDC felt it was too expensive for them to produce even with an R rating. Romero subsequently scaled down the scope of this script into a 155-page draft (often erroneously referred to as the original version), then condensed it again to a 104-page draft labeled the &quot;second version, second draft&quot; in an unsuccessful final attempt to get the story within budget parameters. When this failed, he drastically altered the original story concept and ultimately produced a shooting draft that numbered only 88 pages.

The film was given a very limited release. This is chronicled in the documentary &quot;The Many Days of &#x27;Day of the Dead″&quot; on the two-disc Anchor Bay special edition DVD of the film. Some of the original concepts and characters remain, but the film differs greatly from Romero&#x27;s original script, as stated by actress Lori Cardille:
===Casting===
Joseph Pilato was cast as Rhodes, the film&#x27;s antagonist. As stated by Pilato &quot;He pretty much just gave it to me. I don&#x27;t know if he auditioned other people, but it was very quick. I came in and it was like, &#x27;You got it!. Pilato had acted in two prior films directed by Romero, the first being Pilato&#x27;s debut &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; and the second being &quot;Knightriders&quot;; in between those films he played his first lead role in a film entitled &quot;Effects&quot; (1979). In an interview, Pilato was asked if Romero &quot;had him in mind&quot;, Pilato stated that one of the reasons why he got the role was because of the budget being scaled down from 7 to 3.5 million.

The role of Dr. Matthew &quot;Frankenstein&quot; Logan was played by Richard Liberty. In a 2000 interview, Liberty said that he received a call from Christine Forrest, Romero&#x27;s then-wife and casting director for &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;, wherein he was both offered the role and told that George Romero specifically wrote the role for Liberty. Liberty had previously worked with Romero on the 1973 film &quot;The Crazies&quot;.

Members of the rock band NRBQ cameo in the film in zombie makeup.

===Filming===
Filming took place in the fall of 1984 at locations in Pennsylvania and Florida. All above-ground scenes were filmed at several locations around Florida, where Romero was living at the time. The opening scene was filmed in the downtown area of Fort Myers, Florida.

==Release and reception==
Subsequent to its theatrical release, the film has grossed over 30 million dollars worldwide. &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; would earn most of its gross revenue when the film was released internationally on VHS format, and later DVD and Blu-ray. This is in contrast to the film&#x27;s poor box-office reception when it was released in cinemas.
Based on 44 reviews collected retrospectively by Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; has an 86% approval rating, with a weighted average of 7.1/10, making it the lowest-rated film in Romero&#x27;s original &quot;Dead&quot; trilogy, with &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot; having a 95% approval rating and &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; having a 92% approval rating. The website&#x27;s critical consensus states that &quot;&quot;Day of the Dead&quot; may arguably be the least haunting entry in George A. Romero&#x27;s undead trilogy, but it will give audiences&#x27; plenty to chew on with its shocking gore and scathing view of society&quot;. On Metacritic the film holds a score of 60 out of 100 based on reviews from 13 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

&quot;Day of the Dead&quot; had its world premiere on June 30, 1985, and was given a limited release on July 3, 1985. The film saw its wide release on July 19, 1985. Roger Ebert, who reacted favorably to other films of Romero&#x27;s &quot;Dead&quot; series, gave &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; one and a half stars; he praised the special effects but was put off by what he referred to as &quot;over-acting&quot; in the film, specifically that all of the actors screamed at each other for the entire film in a way that was not present in Romero&#x27;s earlier films. BBC reviewer Almar Haflidason stated &quot;It benefits from a far larger budget than its predecessors, but suffers from a story as malnourished as the zombies that are chewing it up&quot;, Haflidason would go on to give the film three out of five stars. As noted by &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer Janet Maslin &quot;Yes, there are enough spilled guts and severed limbs to satisfy the bloodthirstiest fan. But these moments tend to be clustered together, and a lot of the film is devoted to windy argument.&quot; AllMovie reviewer Keith Phipps stated that: &quot;The last, to date at least, of George Romero&#x27;s living dead films is in many respects the least interesting, although it&#x27;s not for a lack of ambition.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film was the most unsatisfying of the original three films and that &quot;The acting here is generally unimpressive and in the case of Sarah&#x27;s romantic partner, Miguel (Antone DiLeo Jr), unintentionally risible.&quot; Dave Kehr praised the film in his review for the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot;, writing that &quot;this time the focus is less political than philosophical. Beginning from a position of absolute misanthropy, Romero asks what it means to be human, and the answers are funny, horrifying, and ultimately hopeful.&quot;

&quot;Day of the Dead&quot; would peak at 23 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart &quot;Top VHS Sales&quot; in 1986 a year after its initial release.

The film grossed $5.8 million domestically. It fared much better internationally, grossing $28.2 million outside of the United States. &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; total gross is a little over $34 million. The film is also noted for its special effects work, notably Tom Savini&#x27;s make-up, he was honored with his second Saturn Award in 1985 for Best Make-up, the first time being with &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; in 1980. Jonathan Rosenbaum placed the film in his personal canon of 1,000 favorite films, one of two Romero films chosen by Rosenbaum (the other was &quot;Martin&quot;). Romero himself cited &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; as his personal favorite of his original trilogy of zombie films. On May 19, 2012, the film headlined the 12-hour film festival Hudson Horror Show V.

Alex Stewart reviewed &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #83, and stated that &quot;Organized around a tough performance by Lori Cardille as the determined research leader, the movie is as much a study of the several inhumanities of science and the military as it is a feast of gore and putrefaction. After all, disembowelling is only one way, the most literal, of taking people apart.&quot;

===Home video===
The film was released on DVD on November 24, 1998 in the United States and on March 5, 2001 in the United Kingdom. Both the theatrical and an unrated director&#x27;s cut were released as special editions containing identical bonus features, and the DVD was released in the United Kingdom in a region 2 DVD. The Blu-ray version of &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; was released on October 2, 2007. This edition includes many special features, including two audio commentary tracks with writer-director George A. Romero, Tom Savini, production designer Cletus Anderson, and lead actress Lori Cardille. There is also a second commentary with fellow filmmaker and self-proclaimed Romero fan, Roger Avary. It also includes two documentaries; the first one is entitled &quot;The Many Days of &#x27;Day of the Dead″&quot;, which focuses on the original script and the budget, it also included information about shooting in the Gateway Commerce Center. What is also mentioned is the casting details. The second documentary, entitled &quot;Day of the Dead: Behind the Scenes&quot;, focuses mostly on make-up effects. On March 29, 2010, Arrow Video released a 25th Anniversary Edition on Blu-ray exclusive to the UK.

Shout! Factory released the film under its Scream Factory label on September 17, 2013. The release is a Collector&#x27;s Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack with all-new artwork and special features.

===In popular culture===
Near the end of the film version of &quot;Resident Evil&quot; (2002), the protagonist Alice walks outside of her quarantine into a ravaged city street jammed with traffic. The camera pans past a newspaper blowing in the wind stating &quot;The Dead Walk!&quot;, a direct homage to George A. Romero&#x27;s work on &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;.

&quot;Just Voodoo It&quot;, an episode of &quot;Stroker &amp; Hoop&quot;, featured the characters battling zombies using guns made by Double-Wide. They turn out to fire only sunlight, which he claims is because of zombies&#x27; vulnerability to sunlight, hinted at by the film being called &quot;Night of the Dead&quot; and not &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;. Coroner Rick yells at him &quot;That was the sequel!&quot;

The song &quot;M1 A1&quot; from the self-titled 2001 Gorillaz studio album samples the pulsing synthesizers and cries of &quot;Hello! Is anyone there?&quot; from the opening of the film. The song &quot;Hip Albatross&quot;, also by Gorillaz, features a clip of Terry Alexander&#x27;s dialogue. Furthermore, the artwork for the song &quot;November Has Come&quot; off of the Gorillaz&#x27; 2005 album &quot;Demon Days&quot; has a picture of a calendar pinned to a brick wall set to the month of October with all the dates marked off in red Xs (reminiscent of the opening scene in &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;).

The song &quot;Battlefield&quot; from the 2004 Panzer AG studio album &quot;This Is My Battlefield&quot; samples Captain Rhodes asking Sarah in reference to Miguel&#x27;s zombie bite: &quot;You think he wants to walk around after he&#x27;s dead? You think he wants to be one of these things?&quot; The line &quot;Sit down or so help me God I&#x27;ll have you shot&quot; appears once near the end of the song.

The deathcore band Through the Eyes of the Dead sampled a clip at the beginning of the song &quot;Between the Gardens that Bathe in Blood&quot;, released on the EP &quot;The Scars of Ages&quot; (2004).

The Ministry song &quot;Burning Inside&quot; from the studio album &quot;The Mind Is a Terrible Thing to Taste&quot; features an audio sample of the military station&#x27;s warning horn and a few notes of composer John Harrison&#x27;s synthesized score.

The song &quot;Confessions of a Knife (Theme Part 2)&quot; from the 1990 studio album &quot;Confessions of a Knife...&quot; by My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult samples dialogue between Sarah and Captain Rhodes. Captain Rhodes: &quot;I&#x27;ll have you shot.&quot; Sarah: &quot;Are you out of your mind?&quot; Captain Rhodes: &quot;No, ma&#x27;am. Are you?&quot; Along with dialogue from Private Steel and laughter from Private Rickles that repeats later throughout the song. Steel: &quot;Bang! You&#x27;re dead!&quot; followed by Rickles&#x27; laughter.

The song &quot;The Only Good God Is a Dead God&quot; from the 1992 studio album &quot;Psychological Warfare Technology Systems&quot; by Terror Against Terror samples Captain Rhodes&#x27; final screams &quot;Choke on them... choke on them&quot;, with the sounds of the zombies eating him.

American punk band the Misfits recorded a song about the film entitled &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; for their 1997 studio album &quot;American Psycho&quot;.

In 2014, Sherman Howard&#x27;s zombie character Bub appeared in a cameo in &quot;Us&quot;, the fifteenth episode of the fourth season of the AMC series &quot;The Walking Dead&quot;, as one of the walkers encountered by the characters Glenn and Tara in a railroad tunnel, an homage to not only the character but also to the underground setting of &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;.

The first episode of the third season of &quot;Stranger Things&quot; sees the main characters sneaking into their local cinema to watch an early screening of &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;.

Seattle-based musical duo the Little Black Bottles composed &quot;Letter to Miguel&quot;, a tribute song to character Miguel Salazar, for their studio album &quot;Let Them Eat Red Velvet Cake&quot;.

In &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops 4&quot; (2018), the final DLC map for the Zombies mode is named &quot;Tag der Toten&quot; (&#x27;Day of the Dead&#x27; in German). It is a reimagining of the &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops&quot; (2010) Zombies map, &quot;Call of the Dead&quot;, in which Romero appeared as a boss zombie. In &quot;Tag der Toten&quot; his iconic glasses show up as a tribute.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack was released on LP and cassette in the same year as the film (1985) by Saturn Records; it contained 6 tracks, all of which was composed and performed by John Harrison. The vocals came from Sputzy Sparacino who was the lead singer of the Pittsburgh R&amp;B/dance/cover band Modern Man and Delilah, who was known at the time for being the lead singer of the Pittsburgh R&amp;B/gospel/dance band Samson &amp; Delilah on the tracks &quot;If Tomorrow Comes&quot; and &quot;The World Inside Your Eyes&quot;. The album was re-issued in 2002 by Numenorean Music as a limited edition CD. The new edition was limited to 3,000 copies and contained the original album plus five additional tracks from the music and effects reel (the only surviving recording of the film score). It also included a 12-page booklet with information from Harrison and Romero regarding the score.

Waxwork Records later released the soundtrack on vinyl in 2013, making it the first album release with the complete film score.

==Prequel, remakes and television series==
A unofficial prequel was released in 2005, entitled &quot;Day of the Dead 2: Contagium&quot;. Although it is, by definition, an official sequel as Taurus Entertainment Company holds the rights to the original film, no one from the original &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; had any involvement in the film. The film also diverges from the continuity of the original in several respects.

A loose remake of the film, &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;, was released straight to DVD on April 8, 2008. Little of the original plot exists, with only a few basic elements remaining; notably the underground army base near the end of the film, and some of the characters&#x27; names. This marks the second time that Ving Rhames makes an appearance in a remake of a George A. Romero zombie film, following &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; (2004).

On July 10, 2013, it was announced that there would be another remake of &quot;Day of the Dead&quot;, titled &quot;Day of the Dead: Bloodline&quot;. Christa Campbell and Lati Grobman, two of the producers behind &quot;Texas Chainsaw 3D&quot; (2013) have obtained the rights. Campbell, who had a small role in the first remake, said, &quot;We want to keep it as close to the Romero version as possible. These are not going to be zombies climbing walls and doing back flips like in &quot;World War Z&quot;.&quot; Directed by Hèctor Hernández Vicens, it began filming in June 2016. The film was released on December 29, 2017 in Vietnam and on January 5, 2018 in the United States, it was a critical failure.

In February 2020, a television series based on the film was announced and will premiere on Syfy in 2021. The series will follow six strangers in the first 24 hours of a zombie invasion and director Steven Kostanski confirmed the series will have a connection to the original 1985 film.

In July 2021, it was announced that Lori Cardille, Terry Alexander, and Jarlath Conroy were cast in &quot;Night of the Living Dead II&quot;, originally set for a 2022 release.

==Comic==
Stef Hutchinson wrote the 24-page comic &quot;Day of the Dead: Desertion&quot;, which was exclusively released to celebrate the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary and shows the origins of Bub, before becoming a zombie.
