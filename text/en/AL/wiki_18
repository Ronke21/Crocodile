<text>Geelong ( ) (Wathawurrung: &quot;Djilang&quot;/&quot;Djalang&quot;) is a port city in Victoria, Australia, located at the eastern end of Corio Bay (the smaller western portion of Port Phillip Bay) and the left bank of Barwon River, about southwest of Melbourne. With an estimated population of 282,809 in 2023, Geelong is the second-largest city in the state of Victoria. It is the administrative centre for the City of Greater Geelong municipality, which is Port Phillip&#x27;s only regional metropolitan area, and covers all the urban, rural and coastal reserves around the city including the entire Bellarine Peninsula and running from the plains of Lara in the north to the rolling hills of Waurn Ponds to the south, with Corio Bay to the east and the Barrabool Hills to the west.

The traditional owners of the land on which Geelong sits are the Wadawurrung (also known as Wathaurong) Aboriginal people of the Kulin nation. The modern name of Geelong, first recorded in 1827, was derived from the local Wadawurrung name for the region, &quot;Djilang&quot;, thought to mean &quot;land&quot;, &quot;cliffs&quot; or &quot;tongue of land or peninsula&quot;. The area was first surveyed by the European settlers in 1838, three weeks after Melbourne. During the 1850s Victorian gold rush, Geelong experienced a brief boom as the main port to the goldfields of central Victoria. The town then diversified into manufacturing, and during the 1860s became one of the largest manufacturing centres in Australia with its wool mills, ropeworks, and paper mills. During the city&#x27;s early years, inhabitants of Geelong were often called Geelongites or Pivotonians, derived from the city&#x27;s nickname of &quot;The Pivot&quot;, referencing the city&#x27;s role as a shipping and rail hub for the area.

Geelong was proclaimed a city in 1910, with industrial growth from this time until the 1960s establishing the city as a manufacturing centre for the state, and the population grew to over 100,000 by the mid-1960s. Population increases during the 21st century were largely due to growth in service industries, as the manufacturing sector has declined. Redevelopment of the inner city has occurred since the 1990s, as well as gentrification of inner suburbs, and currently has a population growth rate higher than the national average.

Today, Geelong stands as an emerging healthcare, education and advanced manufacturing centre. The city&#x27;s economy is shifting quickly, and, despite experiencing the drawbacks of losing much of its heavy manufacturing, it is seeing much growth in other tertiary sectors, positioning itself as one of the leading non-capital Australian cities. It is now Australia&#x27;s second fastest-growing city. Geelong is regarded as the &quot;Gateway City&quot; due to its critical location to surrounding western Victorian regional centres, providing a transport corridor for surrounding regions to the state capital Melbourne. It is also home to the Geelong Football Club, the second-oldest club in the Australian Football League.

==History==
=== Etymology ===
The name Geelong comes from &quot;Djilang&quot;, used by the Wadawurrung traditional owners of the area at the time of settlement.

===Early history and foundation===

The area of Geelong and the Bellarine Peninsula are the traditional lands of the Wadawurrung (Wathaurong) Indigenous Australian tribe. The first non-Indigenous person recorded as visiting the region was Lieutenant John Murray, who commanded the brig . After anchoring outside Port Phillip Heads (the narrow entrance to Port Phillip, onto which both Geelong and Melbourne now front), on 1 February 1802, he sent a small boat with six men to explore. Led by John Bowen, they explored the immediate area, returning to &quot;Lady Nelson&quot; on 4 February. On reporting favourable findings, &quot;Lady Nelson&quot; entered Port Phillip on 14 February, and did not leave until 12 March. During this time, Murray explored the Geelong area and, whilst on the far side of the bay, claimed the entire area for Britain. He named the bay Port King, after Philip Gidley King, then Governor of New South Wales. Governor King later renamed the bay Port Phillip after the first governor of New South Wales, Arthur Phillip. Arriving not long after Murray was Matthew Flinders, who entered Port Phillip on 27 April 1802. He charted the entire bay, including the Geelong area, believing he was the first to sight the huge expanse of water, but in a rush to reach Sydney before winter set in, he left Port Phillip on 3 May.

In January 1803, Surveyor-General Charles Grimes arrived at Port Phillip in the sloop and mapped the area, including the future site of Geelong, but reported the area was unfavourable for settlement and returned to Sydney on 27 February. In October of the same year, led by Lieutenant Colonel David Collins arrived in the bay to establish the Sullivan Bay penal colony. Collins was dissatisfied with the area chosen, and sent a small party led by First Lieutenant J.H. Tuckey to investigate alternative sites. The party spent 22 to 27 October on the north shore of Corio Bay, where the first Aboriginal death at the hands of a European in Victoria occurred.

The next European visit to the area was by the explorers Hamilton Hume and William Hovell. They reached the northern edge of Corio Bay – the area of Port Phillip that Geelong now fronts – on 16 December 1824, and it was at this time they reported that the Aboriginals called the area &quot;Corayo&quot;, the bay being called &quot;Djillong&quot;. Hume and Hovell had been contracted to travel overland from Sydney to Port Phillip, and having achieved this, they stayed the night and began their return journey two days later on 18 December.

The convict William Buckley escaped from the Sullivan Bay settlement in 1803, and lived among the Wadawurrung people for 32 years on the Bellarine Peninsula. In 1835, John Batman used Indented Head as his base camp, leaving behind several employees whilst he returned to Tasmania (then known as Van Diemen&#x27;s Land) for more supplies and his family. In this same year, Buckley surrendered to the party led by John Helder Wedge and was later pardoned by Lieutenant-Governor Sir George Arthur, and subsequently given the position of interpreter to the natives.
In March 1836, three squatters, David Fisher, James Strachan, and George Russell, arrived on &quot;Caledonia&quot; and settled the area. Geelong was first surveyed by Assistant Surveyor W. H. Smythe three weeks after Melbourne, and was gazetted as a town on 10 October 1838. There was already a church, hotel, store, wool store, and 82 houses, and the town population was 545. By 1841, the first wool had been sent to England and a regular steamer service was running between Geelong and Melbourne. Captain Foster Fyans was commissioned as the local Police Magistrate in 1837 and established himself on the Barwon River at the site of the area of present-day Fyansford. Fyans arranged the first muster of the Indigenous population and 275 Aboriginal people were found to be living in the area. Fyans distributed blankets, sugar and flour to these people but soon ordered his soldiers to &quot;click their triggers&quot; at them when a lack of blankets caused anger. Fyans constructed a breakwater to improve the water supply to the city by preventing the salty lower reaches from mixing with fresh water and pooling water. In 1839, Charles Sievwright, the newly appointed Assistant Protector of Aborigines (for the western district) sets up camp on the Barwon River near Fyans ford.

The Geelong Keys were discovered around 1845 by Governor Charles La Trobe on Corio Bay. They were embedded in the stone in such a way that he believed that they had been there for 100–150 years, possibly dropped by Portuguese explorers. In 1849, Fyans was nominated as the inaugural Mayor of the Geelong Town Council and renowned fly fishing author Alfred Ronalds engraved the town seal. An early settler of Geelong, Alexander Thomson, for which the area of Thomson in Geelong East is named, settled on the Barwon River, and was Mayor of Geelong on five occasions from 1850 to 1858.

===1850s: Gold rush===

Gold was discovered in nearby Ballarat in 1851, causing the Geelong population to grow to 23,000 people by the mid-1850s. To counter this, a false map was issued by Melbourne interests to new arrivals, showing the quickest road to the goldfields as being via Melbourne. The first issue of the &quot;Geelong Advertiser&quot; newspaper was published in 1840 by James Harrison, who also built the world&#x27;s first ether vapour compression cycle ice-making and refrigeration machine in 1844, later being commissioned by a brewery in 1856 to build a machine that cooled beer.

The Geelong Hospital was opened in 1852, and construction on the Geelong City Hall commenced in 1855. Development of the Port of Geelong began with the creation of the first shipping channel in Corio Bay in 1853. The Geelong-to-Melbourne railway was built by the Geelong &amp; Melbourne Railway Company in 1857. Rabbits were introduced to Australia in 1859 by Thomas Austin, who imported them from England for hunting purposes at his Barwon Park property near Winchelsea. One of Geelong&#x27;s best-known department stores, Bright &amp; Hitchcocks, was established in 1861, and the HM Prison Geelong built using convict labour, was opened in 1864.

In 1866, Graham Berry started a newspaper, the &quot;Geelong Register&quot;, as a rival to the established &quot;Geelong Advertiser&quot;. When this proved unsuccessful, he bought the &quot;Advertiser&quot; and made himself editor of the now-merged papers. Using the paper as a platform, he was elected for Geelong West in 1869. In 1877, he switched to Geelong, which he represented until 1886, and served as Victorian Premier in 1875, 1877–1880, and 1880–1881. On the Market Square in the middle of the city, a clock tower was erected in 1856, and an Exhibition Building was opened in 1879.

===1860s: The &#x27;Sleepy Hollow&#x27;===

The gold rush had seen Ballarat and Bendigo grow larger than Geelong in terms of population. Melbourne critics dubbed Geelong &#x27;Sleepy Hollow&#x27;, a tag that recurred many times in the following years. A number of industries became established in Geelong, including Victoria&#x27;s first woollen mill at South Geelong in 1868. In 1869, the clipper &quot;Lightning&quot; caught fire at the Yarra Street pier and was cast adrift in Corio Bay to burn, before being sunk by artillery fire. Improvements to transport saw Geelong emerge as the centre of the Western District of Victoria, with railway lines extended towards Colac in 1876, and to Queenscliff in 1879. Construction of the Hopetoun shipping channel began in 1881 and completed in 1893.

The Geelong Cup was first held in 1872, and Victoria&#x27;s first long-distance telephone call was made from Geelong to Queenscliff on 8 January 1878, only one year after the invention of the device itself. Geelong was also the home of a prosperous wine industry until the emergence of the sap-sucking insect &quot;Phylloxera vastatrix&quot; at Fyansford in 1875, which led to the Victorian Government ordering the destruction of all vines in the Geelong area to prevent the spread of the pest, killing the industry until the 1960s. Between 1886 and 1889, the central business district&#x27;s major banks and insurance companies erected new premises in a solid and ornate character. The existing Geelong Post Office was built during this time and the Gordon Technical College was established. Further industrial growth occurred, with the Fyansford cement works being established in 1890.

The town became referred to as &quot;The Pivot&quot; in the 1860s, owing to its being a rail and shipping hub for western Victoria.

===1900s: A city develops===

The town of Geelong officially became a city on 8 December 1910. The city gained a number of essential services, with electric light supplied by the Geelong Power Station starting in 1902, the Geelong Harbour Trust was formed in December 1905, and the Geelong Waterworks and Sewerage Trust formed in 1908. Electric trams began operation in 1912, travelling from the city centre to the suburbs until their demise in 1956. The first of many stores on the Market Square was opened in 1913, and the first Gala Day festival was held in 1916.

Geelong&#x27;s industrial growth accelerated in the 1920s: woollen mills, fertiliser plants, Ford&#x27;s vehicle plant at Norlane, and the Corio whisky distillery were all established in this period. The &quot;Geelong Advertiser&quot; radio station 3GL (now K-Rock) commenced transmission in 1930, the Great Ocean Road was opened in 1932, and in 1934, the T &amp; G Building opened on the most prominent intersection in the city, the corner of Ryrie and Moorabool Streets.

By 1936, Geelong had displaced Ballarat as Victoria&#x27;s second-largest city.
In 1938, one of the last Port Philip Bay steamers, &quot;Edina&quot;, made its final trip to Geelong, ending a period of seaside excursions and contests for the fastest trip. The Eastern Beach foreshore beautification and pool was completed in 1939 after almost 10 years of work.

On the eve of World War II, the International Harvester works were opened beside Ford at North Shore, along with a grain elevator at nearby Corio Quay, and the Shell Australia oil refinery.

===Post-war period===
Government housing was constructed in the suburbs of East Geelong, Norlane, North Shore, and Corio from the 1950s. The banks of the Barwon River burst in 1952, inundating nearby Belmont Common.

Geelong continued to expand with Corio, Highton, and Belmont growing at such a rate that in February 1967, Geelong accounted for 21% of private home development in Greater Melbourne. Private vehicles became the city&#x27;s major mode of transport. The first parking meters in the city were introduced in 1961, new petrol stations were constructed and the city&#x27;s first supermarket, operated by Woolworths, opened in 1965. Later, support came for Cycling in Geelong with Australia&#x27;s first bike plan in 1977.[3][4]

Industrial growth continued with a second cement works operating at Waurn Ponds by 1964 and the Alcoa Point Henry aluminium smelter constructed in 1962.

Federal government policy changes on tariff protection led to the closure of many Geelong industrial businesses from the 1970s. Most woollen mills closed in 1974 and hectares of warehouse space in the city centre were left empty after wool-handling practices changed. The Target head office opened in North Geelong, Deakin University was established at Waurn Ponds in 1974, and the Geelong Performing Arts Centre opened in 1981. Later, the Australian Animal Health Laboratory was opened in 1985, and the National Wool Museum in 1988.

Market Square, the first enclosed shopping centre in the city, was opened in 1985, with neighbouring Bay City Plaza opened in 1988. The Pyramid Building Society, founded in Geelong in 1959, collapsed in 1990, leaving debts of AU$1.3 billion to over 200,000 depositors, and causing the Geelong economy to stagnate. On 18 May 1993, the City of Greater Geelong was formed by the amalgamation of a number of smaller municipalities with the former City of Geelong. The Waterfront Geelong redevelopment, started in 1994, was designed to enhance use and appreciation of Corio Bay and in 1995 the Barwon River overflowed in the worst flood since 1952.

===21st century===
In 2000, the Carousel Pavilion was opened as a landmark and symbol of the refurbishment of the Geelong waterfront. In 2004, Avalon Airport was upgraded to accommodate interstate passenger travel, providing a base for low-cost airline Jetstar to serve the Melbourne and Geelong urban areas. Geelong is planned to expand towards the south coast, with 2,500 hectares of land to become a major suburban development for 55,000 to 65,000 people, known as Armstrong Creek. In 2006, construction began on the Geelong Ring Road, designed to replace the Princes Highway through Geelong from Corio to Waurn Ponds. It opened in 2009.

More than AU$500-million-worth of major construction was under way in 2007. Major projects include the $150-million Westfield Geelong expansion works, involving a flyover of Yarra Street, the city&#x27;s first Big W store, and an additional 70 new speciality stores; the $37-million Deakin Waterfront campus redevelopment, and the $23-million Deakin Medical School; the $50-million Edgewater apartment development on the waterfront; a number of multimillion-dollar office developments in the CBD; and a new $30-million aquatic centre in Waurn Ponds.

Major developments within Geelong are advocated by influential, non-government group the Committee for Geelong and the region&#x27;s local government alliance, G21 Geelong Region Alliance.

The City of Greater Geelong and four other local municipalities form part of the alliance which identifies the Geelong region&#x27;s priorities, and advocates all levels of government for funding and implement the projects. G21 developed &#x27;The Geelong Region Plan - a sustainable growth strategy&#x27; which was launched by Premier Brumby in 2007. It was the approved strategic plan for the Geelong region. In addition, major projects such as the Geelong Ring Road Connections and duplication of the Princes Highway West obtained funding due to the combined efforts of the region&#x27;s municipalities. As at May 2017, a further 13 Priority Projects are planned for the Geelong region.

The Victoria Government announced the relocation of the Transport Accident Commission headquarters from Melbourne to Geelong in October 2006, which created 850 jobs and an annual economic benefit over $59 million to the Geelong region. The construction of the $80-million Brougham Street headquarters was completed in late 2008. In November 2008, Ford Australia announced that its Australian-designed I6 engine would be re-engineered to meet the latest emissions regulations, and that consequently the engine manufacturing plant would be upgraded (however, all manufacturing of motor vehicles in Geelong and elsewhere throughout Australia ceased by 2017).

A change to the city skyline is occurring with a number of modern apartment buildings on the Waterfront and central business district planned or under construction. On 10 July 2008, approval was given for a $100-million twin-tower apartment complex of 16 and 12 floors to be built on Mercer St in the city&#x27;s western edge. The towers will become the tallest buildings in the city, taking the title from the Mercure Hotel. Further highrise developments are planned as part of the City of Greater Geelong&#x27;s Geelong Western Edge strategic plan. A$17-million 11-story apartment tower has also recently been proposed to be built next to the Deakin Waterfront Campus.

In 2012, a design competition for a &quot;city icon&quot; was run for the City of Geelong by Deakin University and Senia Lawyers. The recipient of the prize and winning design entry was JOH Architects and their design titled &quot;The Sea Dragon&quot;.

Geelong&#x27;s new Library and Heritage Centre opened to the public in November 2015. The new addition to Geelong offers new research facilities, display areas and hosts Geelong&#x27;s extensive heritage, modern and Indigenous. The new library was awarded the Sir Zelman Cowen Award for Public Architecture in 2016.

Currently Geelong is undergoing a major revival effort, the Green Spine Project. The Green Spine project will connect Johnstone Park to the Botanic Gardens by a continuous line of trees via Malop Street. The redevelopment of Malop street will see the installation of separated bike lanes from both pedestrians and local traffic by greenery, the design is an Australian first. This project includes the installation of art sculptures and street art throughout the city centre. Major redevelopments are also occurring at Johnstone Park, with a new raingarden installation, and Lt Malop Street is seeing more upgrades.

In the suburbs Geelong West&#x27;s Pakington Street is seeing major upgrades to its street appeal, with new plantings and upgrades to many of the shops. Manifold Heights&#x27; Shannon Avenue will see redevelopment to make it more pedestrian friendly. To Geelong&#x27;s north, Rippleside is undergoing major changes, with the ongoing development of Balmoral Quay which will see Rippleside Park and nearby St Helens Park connected via a waterfront footpath as well as beach restoration and a boat dock expansion.

Recently new high rise buildings are being built giving Geelong more jobs and housing. Worksafe Victoria opened up a new 14-storey building on Malop St. It opened in mid-2018 and was the tallest building until it was announced that two residential high rises would be built and completed in late 2019. They are called The Mercer and Miramar Apartments.

==Geography==

Geelong is located on the shores of the western tip of Corio Bay, a southwestern inlet of Port Phillip Bay. During clear weather, the distant Melbourne skyline is visible from higher areas of Geelong when viewed across the waters of Port Phillip. The Barwon River flows through the southern fringe of the Geelong city centre before entering Lake Connewarre and the estuary at Barwon Heads before draining into the Bass Strait. The city is situated just east of the gap between the Otway Ranges and Brisbane Ranges, and commands the only lowland passage between the Werribee Plain and Western Volcanic Plains.

Geologically, the oldest rocks in the area date back to the Cambrian period 500 million years ago, with volcanic activities occurring in the Devonian period 350 million years ago. In prehistoric times water covered much of the lowlands that are now Geelong, with the Barwon River estuary located at Belmont Common, the course of the river being changed when Mount Moriac erupted and lava was sent eastwards towards Geelong.

To the east of the city are the Bellarine Hills and the undulating plains of the Bellarine Peninsula. To the west are the sandstone-derived Barrabool Hills and basalt Mount Duneed, and the volcanic plains to the north of Geelong extend to the Brisbane Ranges and the You Yangs. Soils vary from sandy loam, basalt plains, and river loam to rich volcanic soils, suitable for intensive farming, grazing, forestry, and viticulture.

Many materials used to construct buildings were quarried from Geelong, such as bluestone from the You Yangs and sandstone from the Brisbane Ranges. A small number of brown coal deposits exist in the Geelong region, most notably at Anglesea, where it has been mined to fuel Alcoa&#x27;s Anglesea Power Station since 1969. Limestone has also been quarried for cement production at Fyansford since 1888, and Waurn Ponds since 1964.

Development in Geelong started on the shores of Corio Bay in what is now the inner city. Development later spread to the south towards the Barwon River, and the hill of Newtown and Geelong West. Major development south of the river in Belmont did not start until the 1920s, stimulated by the construction of a new bridge over the river in 1926, and the extension of the Geelong tramway system in 1927. Industrial areas were traditionally located on the Corio Bay for port access, or the Barwon River for waste disposal.

In the interwar and post-World War II years, heavy industry continued to establish itself in the flatter northern suburbs, where today industries such as the Geelong Oil Refinery and Ford engine plant reside. Residential development also spread to Corio and Norlane in the north, with new Housing Commission of Victoria estates built to cater for employees of the new industries. From the 1960s, residential growth spread to the Highton hills in the south and North Geelong following prosperous industries like the gasworks, followed by Grovedale in the 1970s. A number of light industrial areas were also established in Breakwater, Moolap and South Geelong.

Changing cargo-handling methods at the Port of Geelong left woolstores in inner Geelong unused, redevelopment beginning in the 1980s with the expansion of Westfield Geelong towards Corio Bay, and culminating in the Waterfront Geelong development. Gentrification of former working-class inner suburbs such as Geelong West, North Geelong, and South Geelong has also occurred. Today, the major residential growth corridors are north towards Lara, east towards Leopold, and south towards Mount Duneed as the Armstrong Creek Growth Area.

===Climate===
Geelong has a temperate oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot; in the Köppen climate classification) with dominant westerly winds, variable clouds, moderate rainfall that tends to fall lightly, mild to warm summers, and cool winters. February is the hottest month and July is the coldest. The highest temperature recorded was on 7 February 2009 during a two-week-long heat wave, with the lowest of recorded on 24 July 1997. The city gets around 37.6 clear days annually.

The average annual rainfall is around , which makes Geelong one of the driest cities in Australia, owing to the pronounced rain shadow of the Otway Ranges to the south-west. Within the city, rainfall shows a strong gradient from south to north, so that the southernmost suburbs can receive around whilst more northerly Lara receives as little as , which is the lowest rainfall in southern Victoria.

==Economy==

More than 10,000 businesses employ over 80,000 people in the Geelong region, with manufacturing and processing industries providing around 15,000 jobs, followed by 13,000 in retail, and 8,000 in health and community services.

In 2020, the Committee for Geelong published a research paper Resilient Geelong which tracks the Geelong economy over several decades. Written Deakin University&#x27;s Prof Louise Johnson, Resilient Geelong makes a series of recommendations for the future of Geelong.

Geelong&#x27;s major employers were the Ford Motor Company engine plant in Norlane (closed in 2016), aircraft maintenance at Avalon Airport, the head office of retail chain Target Australia (until 2018), the Bartter (Steggles) chicken processing plant and the Shell oil refinery at Corio. GMHBA Limited, a health insurance company, is headquartered in Geelong.

The Geelong region attracted over 6 million tourists during 2001. Major tourist attractions include the Waterfront Geelong precinct and Eastern Beach on the shores of Corio Bay, and the National Wool Museum in the city, and more than 30 historical buildings listed on the Victorian Heritage Register. The Geelong area hosts regular international events which are also tourist drawcards, including the Australian International Airshow.
Geelong has a number of shopping precincts in the CBD and surrounding suburbs. The two main shopping centres are located in the CBD - Westfield Geelong and Market Square, with smaller centres in the suburbs including Belmont Village and Waurn Ponds Shopping Centre in the south, Bellarine Village in Newcomb in the east, and Corio Shopping Centre in the north. The opening of the major shopping centres has caused a decline in strip shopping on Moorabool Street, with many empty shops and few customers. Geelong is also home to Mitre 10&#x27;s largest franchisee – Fagg&#x27;s – operating five stores across the town and employing over 160 people.

These major research laboratories are located in the Geelong area: the CSIRO Australian Animal Health Laboratory in East Geelong, CSIRO Division of Textiles and Fibres Technology in Belmont, and the Marine and Freshwater Resources Institute at Queenscliff.

The scheduled closure of Ford&#x27;s Australian manufacturing base in 2016 was confirmed in late May 2013. Headquartered in the Victorian suburb of Broadmeadows, the company had registered losses of AU$600 million over the five years prior to the announcement. It was noted that the corporate fleet and government sales that accounted for two-thirds of large, local car sales in Australia were insufficient to keep Ford&#x27;s products profitable and viable in Australia.

Following the decision by Shell to close its Geelong refinery in April 2013, a third consecutive annual loss was recorded for Shell&#x27;s Australian refining and fuel marketing assets. Revealed in June 2013, the writedown is worth AU$203 million, and was preceded by a $638-million writedown in 2012 and a $407-million writedown in 2011 after the closure of the Clyde Refinery in Sydney.

In April 2016 Target announced that it would be moving its headquarters out of North Geelong to Williams Landing in Melbourne&#x27;s west.

==Demographics==
As of the 2006 census, 160,000 people resided in 68,000 households. The median age of persons in Geelong was 37 years. About 19.4% of the population of Geelong were children aged between 0–14 years, and 26.6% were persons aged 55 years and over. Each dwelling is on average occupied by 2.59 persons, slightly lower than the state and national averages. The median household income was $901 per week, $121 less than the state average, partly due to higher reliance on manufacturing for employment. The population of Geelong is growing by 2500 people each year, and the City of Greater Geelong had the highest rate of building activity in Victoria outside metropolitan Melbourne.

About 78.4% of people from Geelong are Australian-born, with the most common overseas birthplaces being: England (3.6%), Italy (1.1%), Croatia (1.0%), the Netherlands (0.9%), and Scotland (0.8%). Around 14.2% of households speak a language other than English in the home. Notable ethnic groups in the city are the Croatian community, who first came to the city in the 1850s and with migration since World War II are now the largest Croatian community in Australia, and the German settlers who founded Germantown (now Grovedale) in 1849 to escape repression in Prussia for their Lutheran faith.
The 2006 census found the most common religious affiliation in Geelong was Catholicism at 29.4%. St. Mary of the Angels Basilica is the largest congregation in the city. Other affiliations of resident of Geelong include no religion 20.5%, Anglican 14.6%, Uniting Church 7.9%, and Presbyterian and Reformed at 4.3%. The city has a large number of traditional Christian churches, as well as Orthodox Christian churches in the northern suburbs.

==Governance==

In local government, the Geelong region is covered by the City of Greater Geelong. The council was created in 1993 as an amalgamation of a number of other municipalities in the region, with the council chambers located at the Geelong City Hall in central Geelong. The City is made up of four wards - Brownbill (central Geelong and inner suburbs), Bellarine, Kardinia (southern Geelong, south of the Barwon River) and Windermere (northern suburbs). Brownbill, Kardinia and Bellarine are each represented by three councillors, whereas Windermere is represented by two.

From 2012 to 2016, the Mayor of Geelong was directly elected by the public to a four-year term. Entrepreneur and former paparazzo Darryn Lyons held this position from 2013 to 2016.

On 16 April 2016, the Victorian Government dismissed the Mayor and Councillors of the Greater Geelong City Council, following a Commission of Inquiry which found that the council is riven with conflict, unable to manage Geelong&#x27;s economic challenges, has dysfunctional leadership and has a culture of bullying. The government appointed administrators to run the council until council elections were held in 2017. In 2023, the Victorian Government announced that it would appoint monitors to oversee the appointment of a new CEO.

In state politics, the Legislative Assembly districts of Geelong, South Barwon, Lara, and Bellarine cover the Geelong area. After the 2022 Victorian Election, all four of these electorates are held by the Australian Labor Party. Lara and Geelong are currently safe Labor seats with South Barwon increasing its margin and Bellarine more marginal.

On 12 February 2020, Minister for Planning Richard Wynn established Geelong Authority to advise on strategies to attract investment to central Geelong and on major planning applications to help create jobs and drive growth in Geelong. The committee is chaired by Diana Taylor (lawyer) and consists of Mark Edmonds (former Chairman of Geelong Chamber of Commerce), Aamir Qutub (CEO of Enterprise Monkey), Jill Smith (former General Manager of Geelong Arts Centre) and Rory Costelloe (Executive Director of Villawood Properties) and Dr Sarah Leach.

In federal politics, the House of Representatives seats - the Division of Corio and Division of Corangamite cover the Geelong region. Corio roughly covers the northern half of Geelong and has been a safe Australian Labor Party seat since the 1970s, but was previously the seat of Richard Casey, a leading conservative Cabinet member in the 1930s and later Governor-General, as well as Hubert Opperman, a former cycling champion and a prominent minister in the 1960s. It was also the seat of Gordon Scholes, who was Speaker during the Whitlam government. Corio is currently held by Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles.

Corangamite, which roughly includes the southern half of Geelong as well as the Bellarine Peninsula, has traditionally been safe for the Liberal Party, but become more marginal in recent years due to demographic changes and redistributions. Corangamite had been a safe seat for the Liberal Party and its predecessors from the 1930s through the 2000s. Future Prime Minister of Australia James Scullin served one term in this seat in the 1910s. It was won by the Australian Labor Party at the 2019 federal election and again in 2022 by Libby Coker where the margin was increased.

==Public services==

===Education===

Geelong is served by a number of public and private schools that cater to local and overseas students. Over 40,000 primary and secondary students are enrolled in schools in Geelong, with another 27,000 students enrolled in tertiary and further education programs. The first schools in Geelong were established when the town was settled from the 1850s, among them were the historic private schools The Geelong College and Geelong Grammar School.

Geelong is also home to the oldest state secondary school in Victoria, Geelong High School ( 1910), which has been serving the community for over 100 years.

The Gordon Memorial Technical College opened in 1888, and is known today as the Gordon Institute of TAFE. In 1976, the Gordon Institute was divided into two parts, with academic courses becoming part of the newly formed Deakin University based at the Waurn Ponds campus. Deakin University enrolled its first students at its Waurn Ponds campus in 1977. Today, the university is located on a site at Waurn Ponds and has over 1,000 staff members and over 4,000 on-campus students. The university also has a campus located on the waterfront of Corio Bay in the Geelong CBD, a campus in Burwood, Melbourne, and a campus in Warrnambool, in Western Victoria. From 2008 the campus at Waurn Ponds also has been home to Victoria&#x27;s first regional medical school.

===Health===

The major public health service is Barwon Health, which operates 21 separate health sites including University Hospital Geelong on Ryrie Street, and the McKellar Centre on Ballarat Road. Barwon Health services the entire region. The largest private hospital is the nearby St John of God Health Care centre on Myers Street. Prominent healthcare services include the Epworth Hospital located at 1 Epworth Place, Waurn Ponds VIC 3216., and Geelong Health (Geelong West).

===Utilities===

Water storage and supply in Geelong is managed by Barwon Water, a Victoria government-owned urban water corporation. Geelong is supplied with water from three river systems: the Barwon, the East Moorabool, and the West Moorabool Rivers. The catchment areas are the Brisbane Ranges to Geelong&#x27;s north-west, and the Otway Ranges to the south-west. The first water supplies to Geelong were from the Stony Creek reservoirs near Steiglitz, but, as of 2010, Geelong, together with Ballarat, consumes about 70% of the Moorabool River&#x27;s water flow. Sewage from Geelong and district is treated at the Black Rock Treatment Plant at Breamlea and then discharged into Bass Strait.

Geelong was first supplied with electricity in 1902 when the Geelong Power Station opened on the corner of Yarra and Brougham Streets. Later known as Geelong A, the power station was rebuilt in 1920 to increase the capacity, with the station continuing operation until 1961. In 1936, Geelong was connected to the state electrical grid. The Geelong B power station at North Geelong opened in 1954, and was closed in 1970 due to the much greater efficiency of the power stations in the Latrobe Valley. The supply of piped coal gas in Geelong started in 1860 by the Geelong Gas Company. The gasworks were located in North Geelong next to the North Geelong railway station. Geelong was converted to natural gas in 1971, with the Geelong Gas Company being taken over by the Gas &amp; Fuel Corporation of Victoria on 30 June 1971.

==Transportation==
The main form of transportation in Geelong is the automobile. Geelong is well-connected by roads to all of south-west Victoria, to Melbourne by a major-arterial the Princes Freeway (M1) with three or four lanes in each direction, to Warrnambool by the Princes Highway (A1), the Bellarine Peninsula by the Bellarine Highway (B110), Ballarat by the Midland Highway (A300), and to Hamilton by the Hamilton Highway (B140). The $380 million Geelong Ring Road (an extension of the Princes Freeway) bypasses the greater Geelong urban area exiting the Princes Highway near Corio to rejoin the highway at Waurn Ponds. The Lewis Bandt Bridge, named in honour of the Ford Australia engineer who is credited as the inventor of the ute (1934), in Geelong is a feature of the new road.

===Avalon Airport===

Avalon Airport is located about to the north-east of the city of Geelong in the suburb of Avalon. It was established in 1953 for the production of military aircraft. It was also used for the repair of commercial aircraft, and for pilot training. Avalon Airport has also been home to low-cost airline Jetstar since 2004. Flights to Sydney use the airport and in June 2015, Jetstar announced it would fly to the Gold Coast daily from Avalon Airport commencing October 2015. Avalon Airport is the venue for &#x27;Thunder Down Under&#x27; Australian International Airshow every other year.

Avalon Airport had international flights with AirAsia X to and from Kuala Lumpur and Citilink to Denpasar but were cancelled during the pandemic.

===Rail===

Geelong is a major hub for rail transport in Victoria, having frequent services to and from Melbourne, and being at the junction of the Port Fairy, Western standard gauge and the Geelong-Ballarat lines. Eight passenger railway stations are in the urban area, all along the Warrnambool line and served by V/Line trains. The Geelong line provides passenger services to Melbourne in the off-peak with trains departing Geelong every 20 minutes on weekdays, with more frequent services at peak times. According to V/Line, the Geelong line carries more passengers than any other regional rail line in Australia. None of the lines are electrified and all trains servicing Geelong are diesel powered.

Geelong&#x27;s currently operating stations include Little River, Lara, Corio, North Shore, North Geelong, Geelong, South Geelong, Marshall and Waurn Ponds.

In the past, a rail line connected Geelong city to the Bellarine Peninsula through to Queenscliff, ceasing to operate as a regular passenger service in 1976. The Bellarine Railway operates a section of the line between Drysdale and Queenscliff as a tourist attraction.

Passenger services run to Warrnambool three times daily, connecting Geelong with Colac, Terang, and Camperdown. Journey Beyond&#x27;s &quot;The Overland&quot; service between Melbourne and Adelaide stops at the standard-gauge platform provided at North Shore station. It runs six days a week, with three services to Adelaide and three to Melbourne. Freight trains also operate from Melbourne to Geelong serving local industries, as well as to Warrnambool and other western Victorian towns. The main Melbourne-Adelaide standard-gauge line is a heavily used interstate freight route.

Victoria&#x27;s electronic ticketing system, Myki, was implemented on rail services between Marshall and Melbourne on 29 July 2013.

The Victorian government is currently in process of land acquisition and inspection for a potential Torquay rail line which would service both Torquay and the Armstrong Creek growth corridor.

===Ports and ferry services===

The Port of Geelong is located on the shores of Corio Bay, and is the sixth-largest seaport in Australia by tonnage. Major commodities include crude oil and petroleum products, export grain, woodchips, alumina imports, and fertiliser. The Bellarine Peninsula has been linked to the Mornington Peninsula since 1987 by the Searoad ferry, which runs every hour using two roll-on/roll-off ferries between Queenscliff and Sorrento

Port Phillip Ferries began operating twice daily services between Portarlington and Melbourne Docklands in November 2016. Three years later overcrowding on trains led to a similar service being introduced from Geelong to Docklands. The services are popular with both tourists and commuters, providing an alternative access for Geelong and the Bellarine Peninsula to Melbourne. The catamaran ferries seat over 400 passengers, provide a comfortable vantage point to enjoy the sights of Port Phillip. The introduction of the Portarlington service led to a major revamp of the local pier, with pier extensions and a protective rock wall installed.

On 23 October 2022 the Tasmanian ferry service, the Spirit of Tasmania, started operating from a new terminal in North Geelong rather than from Port Melbourne.

===Bus and taxi===

A bus network covering the city centre and most surrounding suburbs provides public transport. Until June 2015 they were operated under the umbrella of the Geelong Transit System. Public Transport Victoria contracts CDC Geelong and McHarry&#x27;s Buslines to provide Geelong&#x27;s bus services and bus services to Torquay and the Bellarine Peninsula. V/Line services link Geelong with Ballarat, Daylesford, Bendigo, Apollo Bay, the Great Ocean Road, the Twelve Apostles and Warrnambool.
Taxi services in Geelong are provided by Geelong Taxi Network, a newly formed depot following the effective merger of Bay City Cabs and Geelong Radio Cabs in July 2007.
The majority of the network covers the city and suburban areas of the city, with &quot;urban&quot; classification for the vehicles in use. The Bellarine Peninsula, and Torquay areas, although part of Geelong Taxi Network, are both covered by separate &quot;country&quot; classification taxis. Often, disputes occur in regards to different taxis from one licence area, picking up work from either of the other two licence areas, which is illegal in most circumstances under current taxi regulations in Victoria. Call centre and radio dispatch services for the new combined network are provided by Silver Top Taxis in Melbourne.

===Cycling and walking===
Geelong also has many kilometres of bicycle trails, including:

* Bay Trail, Corio Quay to Limeburners Point
* Barwon River trail – between Fyansford and South Geelong
* Bellarine Rail Trail is a path between South Geelong and Queenscliffe.

<doc id="59036" wikidata="Q1844" url="?curid=59036" title="Vaduz">
<text>Vaduz (; or ; []) is the capital of Liechtenstein and also the seat of the national parliament. The village, which is located along the Rhine, has 5,696 residents. The most prominent landmark of Vaduz is Vaduz Castle, perched atop a steep hill overlooking the village. It is home to the reigning prince of Liechtenstein and the Liechtenstein princely family. The village&#x27;s distinctive architecture is also displayed in landmarks such as the Cathedral of St. Florin, Government House, Village Hall, the National Art Gallery, as well as the National Museum. Although Vaduz is the best-known village in the principality internationally, it is not the largest; neighbouring Schaan has a larger population.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Vaduz&quot; had been first recorded as &quot;de Faduzes&quot;. The name of the settlement, like most other towns in the Rhine Valley region, is of Romance origin. The name can be traced back to Old Rhaeto-Romance root &quot;auadutg&quot; , which in turn evolved from the Latin .

==History==
Vaduz is mentioned in historic 12th-century manuscripts as &quot;Faduzes&quot;. In 1322 a mention of the castle is made, which was sacked by the Swiss in 1499 during the Swabian War. The entire village was also destroyed.

In the 17th century the Liechtenstein family was seeking a seat in the Imperial diet, the &quot;Reichstag&quot;. As they did not hold any territory that was directly under the Imperial throne they were unable to meet the primary requirement to qualify.

The family yearned for the added power a seat in the Imperial government would bring, and therefore sought to acquire lands that would be &quot;reichsunmittelbar&quot;, or held directly from the Holy Roman Emperor himself, without any intermediate feudal patronage. After some time, the family was able to arrange the purchase of the minuscule &quot;Herrschaft&quot; (&quot;Lordship&quot;) of Schellenberg and the countship of Vaduz (in 1699 and 1712, respectively) from the Hohenems. Tiny Schellenberg and Vaduz possessed exactly the political status required: no feudal lord other than the Emperor.

Thereby, on 23 January 1719, after the purchase had been duly made, Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor, decreed Vaduz and Schellenberg were united, and raised to the dignity of &quot;Fürstentum&quot; (&quot;principality&quot;) with the name &quot;Liechtenstein&quot; in honour of &quot;[his] true servant, Anton Florian of Liechtenstein&quot;. It is on this date that Liechtenstein became a sovereign member state of the Holy Roman Empire. As testimony to the pure political expediency of the purchases, the Princes of Liechtenstein did not set foot in their new principality for over 120 years.

== Politics ==
Vaduz is located in the Oberland electoral district, which has fifteen seats in the Landtag of Liechtenstein. Since the introduction of Liechtenstein municipal law of 1864, Vaduz has been locally administered by a mayor and municipal council. Until 1941, this consisted of the mayor, the municipal treasurer, and seven other councillors.

In 1974, the municipal law was revised which extended the term of the mayor and council to four years and increased the seats of Vaduz&#x27;s municipal council to twelve. The system to elect the municipal council was changed to use a open list proportional representation system. In 1976, Vaduz replaced universal male suffrage with universal suffrage. Universal suffrage was not introduced to Liechtenstein on a national level until 1984.

The incumbent mayor is Florian Meier, elected in the 2024 Vaduz mayoral by-election.

==Main sights==
Vaduz Castle is the home of the reigning prince of Liechtenstein and the Liechtenstein princely family. The castle is visible from almost any location in Vaduz, being perched atop a steep hill in the middle of the village. The Cathedral of St. Florin, Government House and Village Hall display the various styles and periods of architecture in the village.

== Demographics ==
As of 2019, 5,696 people lived in Vaduz. Foreigners resident in the village make up 42% of the population.
With 67% the population is predominantly Roman Catholic, while the percentage of Catholics is significantly higher among residents with Liechtenstein nationality (81%) than among foreigner residents (47%). The largest minority religions in the village are Protestantism (10%) and Islam (8%).
== Culture ==
The National Art Gallery as well as the National Museum are located in Vaduz. The art gallery (Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein) is a museum of modern and contemporary art, and also shows displays from the private princely Liechtenstein Collection, the main public display of which is in Vienna. The building is an architectural landmark built by the Swiss architects Morger, Degelo and Kerez. It was completed in November 2000 and forms a &quot;black box&quot; of tinted concrete and black basalt stone. The museum collection is also the national art collection of Liechtenstein. The Liechtenstein National Museum is showing a permanent exhibition on the cultural and natural history of Liechtenstein as well as special exhibitions. There are also the Postage Stamp Museum and a Ski Museum. Vaduz has a kind of folksong that has been greatly influenced by Switzerland, known as &quot;Köpugeäng&quot;.

==Economy and transport==
Vaduz is one of the few capital cities in the world to not have an airport. The closest major airport is Zurich Airport, and the closest minor airport being the St. Gallen–Altenrhein Airport. Friedrichshafen Airport also provides access to Vaduz. By car, Vaduz is directly accessible via the A13 motorway in Switzerland, or via the A14 motorway in Austria. Vaduz is connected to Switzerland over the Rhine river by the , or the Werdenberger-Binnenkanal bridge for motor vehicles, which was opened in 1975. Buses can be taken from Buchs, St. Gallen, Sevelen and Feldkirch into Vaduz. These buses typically run every 20 to 40 minutes and are operated by Liechtenstein Bus.

Schaan-Vaduz railway station, located in Schaan, is the closest railway station to Vaduz. The station is situated on the Feldkirch–Buchs railway, Liechtenstein&#x27;s only railway line, and is served by the S2 of the Vorarlberg S-Bahn, which is operated by Austrian Federal Railways (ÖBB). It was opened on 24 October 1872 by agreement with Austria-Hungary and Switzerland. There have been attempts to expand the rail network to connect with Vaduz, though these have been unsuccessful.

==Education==
Vaduz has two primary schools: Äule Primary School, near the Vaduzer-Saal; and Ebenholz Primary School, near the University of Liechtenstein, which is also located in the village. Both schools have the same secretariat and administration. The school assignments of children are largely determined by their street addresses. There are four kindergarten sites, of the Kindergarten Bartlegrosch, in Vaduz.

Realschule Vaduz and Oberschule Vaduz are in the Schulzentrum Mühleholz II in Vaduz. Liechtensteinisches Gymnasium is also located in Vaduz. Realschule Schaan and Sportschule Liechtenstein are in nearby Schaan.

<doc id="59038" wikidata="Q179467" url="?curid=59038" title="Fourier series">
<text>A Fourier series () is an expansion of a periodic function into a sum of trigonometric functions. The Fourier series is an example of a trigonometric series. By expressing a function as a sum of sines and cosines, many problems involving the function become easier to analyze because trigonometric functions are well understood. For example, Fourier series were first used by Joseph Fourier to find solutions to the heat equation. This application is possible because the derivatives of trigonometric functions fall into simple patterns. Fourier series cannot be used to approximate arbitrary functions, because most functions have infinitely many terms in their Fourier series, and the series do not always converge. Well-behaved functions, for example smooth functions, have Fourier series that converge to the original function. The coefficients of the Fourier series are determined by integrals of the function multiplied by trigonometric functions, described in .

The study of the convergence of Fourier series focus on the behaviors of the &quot;partial sums&quot;, which means studying the behavior of the sum as more and more terms from the series are summed. The figures below illustrate some partial Fourier series results for the components of a square wave.

Fourier series are closely related to the Fourier transform, a more general tool that can even find the frequency information for functions that are &quot;not&quot; periodic. Periodic functions can be identified with functions on a circle; for this reason Fourier series are the subject of Fourier analysis on the circle group, denoted by formula_1 or formula_2. The Fourier transform is also part of Fourier analysis, but is defined for functions on formula_3.

Since Fourier&#x27;s time, many different approaches to defining and understanding the concept of Fourier series have been discovered, all of which are consistent with one another, but each of which emphasizes different aspects of the topic. Some of the more powerful and elegant approaches are based on mathematical ideas and tools that were not available in Fourier&#x27;s time. Fourier originally defined the Fourier series for real-valued functions of real arguments, and used the sine and cosine functions in the decomposition. Many other Fourier-related transforms have since been defined, extending his initial idea to many applications and birthing an area of mathematics called Fourier analysis.

==History==
The Fourier series is named in honor of Jean-Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768–1830), who made important contributions to the study of trigonometric series, after preliminary investigations by Leonhard Euler, Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert, and Daniel Bernoulli. Fourier introduced the series for the purpose of solving the heat equation in a metal plate, publishing his initial results in his 1807 &quot;Mémoire sur la propagation de la chaleur dans les corps solides&quot; (&quot;Treatise on the propagation of heat in solid bodies&quot;), and publishing his &quot;Théorie analytique de la chaleur&quot; (&quot;Analytical theory of heat&quot;) in 1822. The &quot;Mémoire&quot; introduced Fourier analysis, specifically Fourier series. Through Fourier&#x27;s research the fact was established that an arbitrary (at first, continuous and later generalized to any piecewise-smooth) function can be represented by a trigonometric series. The first announcement of this great discovery was made by Fourier in 1807, before the French Academy. Early ideas of decomposing a periodic function into the sum of simple oscillating functions date back to the 3rd century BC, when ancient astronomers proposed an empiric model of planetary motions, based on deferents and epicycles.

Independently of Fourier, astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel introduced Fourier series to solve Kepler&#x27;s equation. His work was published in 1819, unaware of Fourier&#x27;s work which remained unpublished until 1822.

The heat equation is a partial differential equation. Prior to Fourier&#x27;s work, no solution to the heat equation was known in the general case, although particular solutions were known if the heat source behaved in a simple way, in particular, if the heat source was a sine or cosine wave. These simple solutions are now sometimes called eigensolutions. Fourier&#x27;s idea was to model a complicated heat source as a superposition (or linear combination) of simple sine and cosine waves, and to write the solution as a superposition of the corresponding eigensolutions. This superposition or linear combination is called the Fourier series.

From a modern point of view, Fourier&#x27;s results are somewhat informal, due to the lack of a precise notion of function and integral in the early nineteenth century. Later, Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet and Bernhard Riemann expressed Fourier&#x27;s results with greater precision and formality.

Although the original motivation was to solve the heat equation, it later became obvious that the same techniques could be applied to a wide array of mathematical and physical problems, and especially those involving linear differential equations with constant coefficients, for which the eigensolutions are sinusoids. The Fourier series has many such applications in electrical engineering, vibration analysis, acoustics, optics, signal processing, image processing, quantum mechanics, econometrics, shell theory, etc.

=== Beginnings ===
Joseph Fourier wrote

This immediately gives any coefficient &quot;ak&quot; of the trigonometric series for φ(&quot;y&quot;) for any function which has such an expansion. It works because if φ has such an expansion, then (under suitable convergence assumptions) the integral
formula_4
can be carried out term-by-term. But all terms involving formula_5 for vanish when integrated from −1 to 1, leaving only the formula_6 term, which is &quot;1&quot;.

In these few lines, which are close to the modern formalism used in Fourier series, Fourier revolutionized both mathematics and physics. Although similar trigonometric series were previously used by Euler, d&#x27;Alembert, Daniel Bernoulli and Gauss, Fourier believed that such trigonometric series could represent any arbitrary function. In what sense that is actually true is a somewhat subtle issue and the attempts over many years to clarify this idea have led to important discoveries in the theories of convergence, function spaces, and harmonic analysis.

When Fourier submitted a later competition essay in 1811, the committee (which included Lagrange, Laplace, Malus and Legendre, among others) concluded: &quot;...the manner in which the author arrives at these equations is not exempt of difficulties and...his analysis to integrate them still leaves something to be desired on the score of generality and even rigour&quot;.

===Fourier&#x27;s motivation===

The Fourier series expansion of the sawtooth function (below) looks more complicated than the simple formula formula_7, so it is not immediately apparent why one would need the Fourier series. While there are many applications, Fourier&#x27;s motivation was in solving the heat equation. For example, consider a metal plate in the shape of a square whose sides measure formula_8 meters, with coordinates formula_9. If there is no heat source within the plate, and if three of the four sides are held at 0 degrees Celsius, while the fourth side, given by formula_10, is maintained at the temperature gradient formula_11 degrees Celsius, for formula_12 in formula_13, then one can show that the stationary heat distribution (or the heat distribution after a long time has elapsed) is given by
: formula_14
Here, sinh is the hyperbolic sine function. This solution of the heat equation is obtained by multiplying each term of the equation from Analysis § Example by formula_15. While our example function formula_16 seems to have a needlessly complicated Fourier series, the heat distribution formula_17 is nontrivial. The function formula_18 cannot be written as a closed-form expression. This method of solving the heat problem was made possible by Fourier&#x27;s work.

===Other applications===
Another application is to solve the Basel problem by using Parseval&#x27;s theorem. The example generalizes and one may compute ζ(2&quot;n&quot;), for any positive integer &quot;n&quot;.

==Definition==
The Fourier series of a complex-valued -periodic function formula_16, integrable over the interval formula_20 on the real line, is defined as a trigonometric series of the form
formula_21
such that the &quot;Fourier coefficients&quot; formula_22 are complex numbers defined by the integral
formula_23
The series does not necessarily converge (in the pointwise sense) and, even if it does, it is not necessarily equal to formula_16. Only when certain conditions are satisfied (e.g. if formula_16 is continuously differentiable) does the Fourier series converge to formula_16, i.e.,
formula_27
For functions satisfying the Dirichlet sufficiency conditions, pointwise convergence holds. However, these are not necessary conditions and there are many theorems about different types of convergence of Fourier series (e.g. uniform convergence or mean convergence). The definition naturally extends to the Fourier series of a (periodic) distribution formula_28 (also called &quot;Fourier-Schwartz series&quot;). Then the Fourier series converges to formula_16 in the distribution sense.

The process of determining the Fourier coefficients of a given function or signal is called analysis, while forming the associated trigonometric series (or its various approximations) is called synthesis.

=== Synthesis ===
A Fourier series can be written in several equivalent forms, shown here as the formula_30 partial sums formula_31 of the Fourier series of formula_16:

The harmonics are indexed by an integer, formula_33 which is also the number of cycles the corresponding sinusoids make in interval formula_34. Therefore, the sinusoids have:

* a wavelength equal to formula_35 in the same units as formula_12.
* a frequency equal to formula_37 in the reciprocal units of formula_12.

These series can represent functions that are just a sum of one or more frequencies in the harmonic spectrum. In the limit formula_39, a trigonometric series can also represent the intermediate frequencies and/or non-sinusoidal functions because of the infinite number of terms.

=== Analysis ===
The coefficients can be given/assumed, such as a music synthesizer or time samples of a waveform. In the latter case, the exponential form of Fourier series synthesizes a discrete-time Fourier transform where variable formula_12 represents frequency instead of time. In general, the coefficients are determined by &quot;analysis&quot; of a given function formula_16 whose domain of definition is an interval of length formula_42.

The formula_43 scale factor follows from substituting into and utilizing the orthogonality of the trigonometric system. The equivalence of and follows from Euler&#x27;s formula
formula_44
resulting in:
 + i b_{_{-n}}) &amp; \text{if } n &lt; 0,\\
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;}}
with formula_45 being the mean value of formula_28 on the interval formula_42. Conversely:
 \qquad &amp;\textrm{for}~ n &gt; 0 \\
 b_{_n} &amp;= i(c_{_n}-c_{_{-n}}) \qquad &amp;\textrm{for}~ n &gt; 0 \end{aligned}&lt;/math&gt;
==== Example ====
Plot of the [[sawtooth wave]], a periodic continuation of the linear function formula_48 on the interval formula_49

Consider a sawtooth function:
formula_50
In this case, the Fourier coefficients are given by
formula_51
It can be shown that the Fourier series converges to formula_16 at every point formula_12 where formula_28 is differentiable, and therefore:
formula_55
When formula_56, the Fourier series converges to 0, which is the half-sum of the left- and right-limit of formula_28 at formula_56. This is a particular instance of the Dirichlet theorem for Fourier series.

This example leads to a solution of the Basel problem.

===Amplitude-phase form===
If the function formula_16 is real-valued then the Fourier series can also be represented as

where formula_60 is the amplitude and formula_61 is the phase shift of the formula_62 harmonic.

The equivalence of and follows from the trigonometric identity:
formula_63
which implies
formula_64

are the rectangular coordinates of a vector with polar coordinates formula_65 and formula_66 given by
formula_67 where formula_68 is the argument of formula_69.

An example of determining the parameter formula_70 for one value of formula_71 is shown in Figure 2. It is the value of formula_72 at the maximum correlation between formula_16 and a cosine &quot;template,&quot; formula_74 The blue graph is the cross-correlation function, also known as a matched filter:

:formula_75

Fortunately, it isn&#x27;t necessary to evaluate this entire function, because its derivative is zero at the maximum:
formula_76 Hence
formula_77
===Common notations===
The notation formula_22 is inadequate for discussing the Fourier coefficients of several different functions. Therefore, it is customarily replaced by a modified form of the function (formula_79 in this case), such as formula_80 or formula_81 and functional notation often replaces subscripting:

:formula_82

In engineering, particularly when the variable formula_12 represents time, the coefficient sequence is called a frequency domain representation. Square brackets are often used to emphasize that the domain of this function is a discrete set of frequencies.

Another commonly used frequency domain representation uses the Fourier series coefficients to modulate a Dirac comb:
:formula_84

where formula_85 represents a continuous frequency domain. When variable formula_12 has units of seconds, formula_85 has units of hertz. The &quot;teeth&quot; of the comb are spaced at multiples (i.e. harmonics) of formula_88, which is called the fundamental frequency. formula_16 can be recovered from this representation by an inverse Fourier transform:

:formula_90

The constructed function formula_91 is therefore commonly referred to as a Fourier transform, even though the Fourier integral of a periodic function is not convergent at the harmonic frequencies.

== Table of common Fourier series ==
Some common pairs of periodic functions and their Fourier series coefficients are shown in the table below.

* formula_16 designates a periodic function with period formula_93
* formula_94 designate the Fourier series coefficients (sine-cosine form) of the periodic function formula_95

== Table of basic transformation rules==

This table shows some mathematical operations in the time domain and the corresponding effect in the Fourier series coefficients. Notation:
* Complex conjugation is denoted by an asterisk.
*formula_96 designate formula_42-periodic functions or functions defined only for formula_98
* formula_99 designate the Fourier series coefficients (exponential form) of formula_28 and formula_101

== Properties ==
=== Symmetry relations ===
When the real and imaginary parts of a complex function are decomposed into their even and odd parts, there are four components, denoted below by the subscripts RE, RO, IE, and IO. And there is a one-to-one mapping between the four components of a complex time function and the four components of its complex frequency transform:

:formula_102

From this, various relationships are apparent, for example:

* The transform of a real-valued function formula_103 is the &quot;conjugate symmetric&quot; function formula_104 Conversely, a &quot;conjugate symmetric&quot; transform implies a real-valued time-domain.
* The transform of an imaginary-valued function formula_105 is the &quot;conjugate antisymmetric&quot; function formula_106 and the converse is true.
* The transform of a &quot;conjugate symmetric&quot; function formula_107 is the real-valued function formula_108 and the converse is true.
* The transform of a &quot;conjugate antisymmetric&quot; function formula_109 is the imaginary-valued function formula_110 and the converse is true.

=== Riemann–Lebesgue lemma ===

If formula_111 is integrable, formula_112, formula_113 and formula_114

=== Parseval&#x27;s theorem ===

If formula_28 belongs to formula_116 (periodic over an interval of length formula_42) then: formula_118

=== Plancherel&#x27;s theorem ===

If formula_119 are coefficients and formula_120 then there is a unique function formula_121 such that formula_122 for every formula_71.

=== Convolution theorems ===
Given formula_42-periodic functions, formula_125 and formula_126 with Fourier series coefficients formula_127 and formula_128 formula_129

*The pointwise product: formula_130 is also formula_42-periodic, and its Fourier series coefficients are given by the discrete convolution of the formula_111 and formula_133 sequences: formula_134
*The periodic convolution: formula_135 is also formula_42-periodic, with Fourier series coefficients: formula_137
*A doubly infinite sequence formula_138 in formula_139 is the sequence of Fourier coefficients of a function in formula_140 if and only if it is a convolution of two sequences in formula_141. See 

=== Derivative property ===
If formula_28 is a 2-periodic function on formula_143 which is formula_144 times differentiable, and its formula_6 derivative is continuous, then formula_28 belongs to the function space formula_147.
* If formula_148, then the Fourier coefficients of the formula_6 derivative of formula_28 can be expressed in terms of the Fourier coefficients formula_151 of formula_28, via the formula formula_153 In particular, since for any fixed formula_154 we have formula_155 as formula_156, it follows that formula_157 tends to zero, i.e., the Fourier coefficients converge to zero faster than the formula_6 power of formula_159.

=== Compact groups ===
One of the interesting properties of the Fourier transform which we have mentioned, is that it carries convolutions to pointwise products. If that is the property which we seek to preserve, one can produce Fourier series on any compact group. Typical examples include those classical groups that are compact. This generalizes the Fourier transform to all spaces of the form &quot;L&quot;2(&quot;G&quot;), where &quot;G&quot; is a compact group, in such a way that the Fourier transform carries convolutions to pointwise products. The Fourier series exists and converges in similar ways to the case.

An alternative extension to compact groups is the Peter–Weyl theorem, which proves results about representations of compact groups analogous to those about finite groups.

=== Riemannian manifolds ===
If the domain is not a group, then there is no intrinsically defined convolution. However, if formula_160 is a compact Riemannian manifold, it has a Laplace–Beltrami operator. The Laplace–Beltrami operator is the differential operator that corresponds to Laplace operator for the Riemannian manifold formula_160. Then, by analogy, one can consider heat equations on formula_160. Since Fourier arrived at his basis by attempting to solve the heat equation, the natural generalization is to use the eigensolutions of the Laplace–Beltrami operator as a basis. This generalizes Fourier series to spaces of the type formula_163, where formula_160 is a Riemannian manifold. The Fourier series converges in ways similar to the formula_165 case. A typical example is to take formula_160 to be the sphere with the usual metric, in which case the Fourier basis consists of spherical harmonics.

=== Locally compact Abelian groups ===
The generalization to compact groups discussed above does not generalize to noncompact, nonabelian groups. However, there is a straightforward generalization to Locally Compact Abelian (LCA) groups.

This generalizes the Fourier transform to formula_167 or formula_168, where formula_169 is an LCA group. If formula_169 is compact, one also obtains a Fourier series, which converges similarly to the formula_165 case, but if formula_169 is noncompact, one obtains instead a Fourier integral. This generalization yields the usual Fourier transform when the underlying locally compact Abelian group is formula_143.

== Extensions ==
=== Fourier-Stieltjes series ===

Let formula_174 be a function of bounded variation defined on the closed inverval formula_175. The Fourier series whose coefficients are given by
formula_176
is called the &quot;Fourier-Stieltjes series&quot;. The space of functions of bounded variation formula_177 is a subspace of formula_178. As any formula_179 defines a Radon measure (i.e. a locally finite Borel measure on formula_143), this definition can be extended as follows.

Consider the space formula_181 of all finite Borel measures on the real line; as such formula_182. If there is a measure formula_183 such that the Fourier-Stieltjes coefficients are given by
formula_184
then the series is called a Fourier-Stieltjes series. Likewise, the function formula_185, where formula_183, is called a Fourier-Stieltjes transform.

The question whether or not formula_187 exists for a given sequence of formula_188 forms the basis of the trigonometric moment problem.

Furthermore, formula_189 is a strict subspace of the space of (tempered) distributions formula_190, i.e., formula_191. If the Fourier coefficients are determined by a distribution formula_192 then the series is described as a &quot;Fourier-Schwartz series&quot;. Contrary to the Fourier-Stieltjes series, deciding whether a given series is a Fourier series or a Fourier-Schwartz series is relatively trivial due to the characteristics of its dual space; the Schwartz space formula_193.

=== Fourier series on a square ===
We can also define the Fourier series for functions of two variables formula_12 and formula_195 in the square formula_196:
formula_197

Aside from being useful for solving partial differential equations such as the heat equation, one notable application of Fourier series on the square is in image compression. In particular, the JPEG image compression standard uses the two-dimensional discrete cosine transform, a discrete form of the Fourier cosine transform, which uses only cosine as the basis function.

For two-dimensional arrays with a staggered appearance, half of the Fourier series coefficients disappear, due to additional symmetry.

=== Fourier series of Bravais-lattice-periodic-function ===

A three-dimensional Bravais lattice is defined as the set of vectors of the form:
formula_198
where formula_199 are integers and formula_200 are three linearly independent vectors. Assuming we have some function, formula_201, such that it obeys the condition of periodicity for any Bravais lattice vector formula_202, formula_203, we could make a Fourier series of it. This kind of function can be, for example, the effective potential that one electron &quot;feels&quot; inside a periodic crystal. It is useful to make the Fourier series of the potential when applying Bloch&#x27;s theorem. First, we may write any arbitrary position vector formula_204 in the coordinate-system of the lattice:
formula_205
where formula_206 meaning that formula_207 is defined to be the magnitude of formula_200, so formula_209 is the unit vector directed along formula_200.

Thus we can define a new function,
formula_211

This new function, formula_212, is now a function of three-variables, each of which has periodicity formula_213, formula_214, and formula_215 respectively:
formula_216

This enables us to build up a set of Fourier coefficients, each being indexed by three independent integers formula_217. In what follows, we use function notation to denote these coefficients, where previously we used subscripts. If we write a series for formula_218 on the interval formula_219 for formula_220, we can define the following:
formula_221

And then we can write:
formula_222

Further defining:
formula_223

We can write formula_218 once again as:
formula_225

Finally applying the same for the third coordinate, we define:
formula_226

We write formula_218 as:
formula_228

Re-arranging:
formula_229

Now, every &quot;reciprocal&quot; lattice vector can be written (but does not mean that it is the only way of writing) as formula_230, where formula_231 are integers and formula_232 are reciprocal lattice vectors to satisfy formula_233 (formula_234 for formula_235, and formula_236 for formula_237). Then for any arbitrary reciprocal lattice vector formula_238 and arbitrary position vector formula_204 in the original Bravais lattice space, their scalar product is:
formula_240

So it is clear that in our expansion of formula_241, the sum is actually over reciprocal lattice vectors:
formula_242

where formula_243

Assuming
formula_244
we can solve this system of three linear equations for formula_12, formula_195, and formula_247 in terms of formula_220, formula_249 and formula_250 in order to calculate the volume element in the original rectangular coordinate system. Once we have formula_12, formula_195, and formula_247 in terms of formula_220, formula_249 and formula_250, we can calculate the Jacobian determinant:
formula_257
which after some calculation and applying some non-trivial cross-product identities can be shown to be equal to:
formula_258

(it may be advantageous for the sake of simplifying calculations, to work in such a rectangular coordinate system, in which it just so happens that formula_259 is parallel to the &quot;x&quot; axis, formula_260 lies in the &quot;xy&quot;-plane, and formula_261 has components of all three axes). The denominator is exactly the volume of the primitive unit cell which is enclosed by the three primitive-vectors formula_259, formula_260 and formula_261. In particular, we now know that
formula_265

We can write now formula_266 as an integral with the traditional coordinate system over the volume of the primitive cell, instead of with the formula_220, formula_249 and formula_250 variables:
formula_270
writing formula_271 for the volume element formula_272; and where formula_273 is the primitive unit cell, thus, formula_274 is the volume of the primitive unit cell.

=== Hilbert space ===
As the trigonometric series is a special class of orthogonal system, Fourier series can naturally be defined in the context of Hilbert spaces. For example, the space of square-integrable functions on formula_165 forms the Hilbert space formula_276. Its inner product, defined for any two elements formula_85 and formula_218, is given by:
formula_279
This space is equipped with the orthonormal basis formula_280.
Then the (generalized) Fourier series expansion of formula_281, given by
formula_282
can be written as
formula_283

The sine-cosine form follows in a similar fashion. Indeed, the sines and cosines form an orthogonal set:
formula_284
formula_285
(where &quot;δ&quot;&quot;mn&quot; is the Kronecker delta), and
formula_286
Hence, the set
formula_287
also forms an orthonormal basis for formula_276. The density of their span is a consequence of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem, but follows also from the properties of classical kernels like the Fejér kernel.

== Fourier theorem proving convergence of Fourier series ==
In engineering, the Fourier series is generally assumed to converge except at jump discontinuities since the functions encountered in engineering are usually better-behaved than those in other disciplines. In particular, if formula_28 is continuous and the derivative of formula_16 (which may not exist everywhere) is square integrable, then the Fourier series of formula_28 converges absolutely and uniformly to formula_16. If a function is square-integrable on the interval formula_293, then the Fourier series converges to the function almost everywhere. It is possible to define Fourier coefficients for more general functions or distributions, in which case pointwise convergence often fails, and convergence in norm or weak convergence is usually studied.

The theorems proving that a Fourier series is a valid representation of any periodic function (that satisfies the Dirichlet conditions), and informal variations of them that don&#x27;t specify the convergence conditions, are sometimes referred to generically as &quot;Fourier&#x27;s theorem&quot; or &quot;the Fourier theorem&quot;.

===Least squares property===
The earlier :
:formula_294
is a trigonometric polynomial of degree formula_295 that can be generally expressed as:
:formula_296
Parseval&#x27;s theorem implies that:

&lt;/math&gt; Fourier coefficient of the first derivative formula_297. Since formula_297 is continuous, and therefore bounded, it is square-integrable and its Fourier coefficients are square-summable. Then, by the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality,

:formula_299

This means that formula_28 is absolutely summable. The sum of this series is a continuous function, equal to formula_28, since the Fourier series converges in formula_178 to formula_28:

This result can be proven easily if formula_28 is further assumed to be formula_305, since in that case formula_306 tends to zero as formula_307. More generally, the Fourier series is absolutely summable, thus converges uniformly to formula_28, provided that formula_28 satisfies a Hölder condition of order formula_310. In the absolutely summable case, the inequality:
:formula_311

proves uniform convergence.

Many other results concerning the convergence of Fourier series are known, ranging from the moderately simple result that the series converges at formula_12 if formula_28 is differentiable at formula_12, to more sophisticated results such as Carleson&#x27;s theorem which states that the Fourier series of an formula_315 function converges almost everywhere.

=== Divergence ===
Since Fourier series have such good convergence properties, many are often surprised by some of the negative results. For example, the Fourier series of a continuous &quot;T&quot;-periodic function need not converge pointwise. The uniform boundedness principle yields a simple non-constructive proof of this fact.

In 1922, Andrey Kolmogorov published an article titled &quot;Une série de Fourier-Lebesgue divergente presque partout&quot; in which he gave an example of a Lebesgue-integrable function whose Fourier series diverges almost everywhere. He later constructed an example of an integrable function whose Fourier series diverges everywhere.

It is possible to give explicit examples of a continuous function whose Fourier series diverges at 0: for instance, the even and 2π-periodic function &quot;f&quot; defined for all &quot;x&quot; in [0,π] by

:formula_316

Because the function is even the Fourier series contains only cosines:

:formula_317

The coefficients are:

:formula_318

As increases, the coefficients will be positive and increasing until they reach a value of about formula_319 at formula_320 for some and then become negative (starting with a value around formula_321) and getting smaller, before starting a new such wave. At formula_322 the Fourier series is simply the running sum of formula_323 and this builds up to around

:formula_324

in the th wave before returning to around zero, showing that the series does not converge at zero but reaches higher and higher peaks. Note that though the function is continuous, it is not differentiable.

<text>Melaleuca () is a genus of nearly 300 species of plants in the myrtle family, Myrtaceae, commonly known as paperbarks, honey-myrtles, bottlebrushes or tea-trees (although the last name is also applied to species of &quot;Leptospermum&quot;). They range in size from small shrubs that rarely grow to more than high, to trees up to . Their flowers generally occur in groups, forming a &quot;head&quot; or &quot;spike&quot; resembling a brush used for cleaning bottles, containing up to 80 individual flowers.

Melaleucas are an important food source for nectarivorous insects, birds, and mammals. Many are popular garden plants, either for their attractive flowers or as dense screens and a few have economic value for producing fencing and oils such as &quot;tea tree&quot; oil. Most melaleucas are endemic to Australia, with a few also occurring in Malesia. Seven are endemic to New Caledonia, and one is found only on Australia&#x27;s Lord Howe Island. 

Melaleucas are found in a wide variety of habitats. Many are adapted for life in swamps and boggy places, while others thrive in the poorest of sandy soils or on the edge of saltpans. Some have a wide distribution and are common, whilst others are rare and endangered. Land clearing, exotic myrtle rust, and especially draining and clearing of swamps threaten many species.

==Description==
Melaleucas range in size from small shrubs such as &quot;M. aspalathoides&quot; and &quot;M. concinna&quot; which rarely grow to more than high, to trees like &quot;M. cajuputi&quot; and &quot;M. quinquenervia&quot;, which can reach . (One specimen of &quot;M. cajuputi&quot; reached a height of .)

Many, like &quot;M. lineariifolia&quot;, are known as paperbarks and have bark that can be peeled in thin sheets, whilst about 20% of the genus, including &quot;M. bracteata&quot;, have hard, rough bark and another 20% have fibrous bark. Every species in the genus is an evergreen, and the leaves vary in size from minute and scale-like (&quot;M. micromera&quot;) to long (&quot;M. leucadendra&quot;). Most have distinct oil glands dotted in the leaves, making the leaves aromatic, especially when crushed.

Melaleuca flowers are usually arranged in spikes or heads. Within the head or spike, the flowers are often in groups of two or three, each flower or group having a papery bract at its base. Five sepals occur, although these are sometimes fused into a ring of tissue and five petals which are usually small, not showy, and fall off as the flower opens or soon after. The stamens vary greatly in colour, from white to cream or yellow, red, or mauve with their yellow tips (the anthers) contrasting with their &quot;stalks&quot; (filaments).

The fruit are woody, cup-shaped, barrel-shaped, or almost spherical capsules, often arranged in clusters along the stems. The seeds are sometimes retained in the fruit for many years, only opening when the plant, or part of it, dies or is heated in a bushfire. In tropical areas, seeds are released annually in the wet season.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Melaleuca&quot; is derived from the Ancient Greek μέλας (&quot;mélas&quot;) meaning &quot;dark&quot; or &quot;black&quot; and λευκός (&quot;leukós&quot;) meaning &quot;white&quot;, apparently because one of the first specimens described had fire-blackened white bark. The common name &quot;tea tree&quot; has been applied to species in the genera &quot;Leptospermum&quot;, &quot;Melaleuca&quot;, &quot;Kunzea&quot;, and &quot;Baeckea&quot; because the sailors on the &quot;Endeavour&quot; used the leaves of a shrub from one of these groups as a replacement for tea (&quot;Camellia sinensis)&quot; during Captain James Cook&#x27;s 1770 voyage to Australia.

==Taxonomy==

The first known description of a &quot;Melaleuca&quot; species was written by Rumphius in 1741, in &quot;Herbarium amboinense&quot; before the present system of naming plants was written. The plant he called &quot;Arbor alba&quot; is now known as &quot;Melaleuca leucadendra&quot;. The name &quot;Melaleuca&quot; was first used by Linnaeus in 1767. Many species previously known as &quot;Metrosideros&quot; were then placed in &quot;Melaleuca&quot;. In Australia, &quot;Melaleuca&quot; is the third most diverse plant genus with up to 300 species.

The genus &quot;Callistemon&quot; was raised by Robert Brown, who noted its similarity to &quot;Melaleuca&quot;, distinguishing it only on the basis of whether the stamens are free of each other, or joined in bundles. Botanists in the past, including Ferdinand von Mueller and Lyndley Craven have proposed uniting the two genera but the matter is not decided. Evidence from DNA studies suggests that either &quot;Callistemon&quot; and some other genera be incorporated into &quot;Melaleuca&quot; or that at least 10 new genera be created from the present genus.

In 2014, Lyndley Craven and others proposed, on the basis of DNA evidence and a lack of morphological support, that species in the genera &quot;Beaufortia&quot;, &quot;Calothamnus&quot;, &quot;Conothamnus&quot;, &quot;Eremaea&quot;, &quot;Lamarchea&quot;, &quot;Petraeomyrtus&quot;, &quot;Phymatocarpus&quot; and &quot;Regelia&quot; be transferred to &quot;Melaleuca&quot;. The World Checklist of Selected Plant Families maintained by the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew lists &quot;Calothamnus&quot; and the other genera as synonyms of the accepted genus &quot;Melaleuca&quot;. The move has not been adopted by all Australian herbaria with some taxonomists, including Alex George opposing the move.

==Distribution and habitat==

Most melaleucas occur naturally only on the Australian mainland. Eight occur in Tasmania, but only two are endemic to that island. One (&quot;M. howeana&quot;) is endemic to Lord Howe Island and seven are endemic to Grande Terre, the main island of New Caledonia. A few tropical species also occur in Papua New Guinea, and the distribution of one subspecies, &quot;Melaleuca cajuputi&quot; subsp. &quot;cumingiana&quot; extends as far north as Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. The southwest of Western Australia has the greatest density of species, and in the tropical north of the continent, species such as &quot;M. argentea&quot; and &quot;M. leucadendra&quot; are the dominant species over large areas.

Melaleucas grow in a range of soil types and many tolerate occasional or even permanent waterlogging. Some species, especially the South Australian swamp paperbark, &quot;M. halmaturorum&quot;, thrive in saline soils where few other species survive. Many are fire tolerant, regenerating from epicormic buds or by coppicing, but no melaleucas occur in rainforest and few species occur in the arid zone.

==Ecology==
Melaleucas are mostly pollinated by insects, including the introduced honey bee (&quot;Apis mellifera&quot;), flies, beetles, wasps and thrips. Birds such as lorikeets and honeyeaters as well as bats often visit the flowers and are probably also pollinators.

Some species of &quot;Melaleuca&quot;, especially &quot;M. alternifolia&quot;, are cultivated for the production of tea tree oil, and in plantations are susceptible to a number of insect pests. The most significant of these is the chrysomelid &quot;Paropsisterna tigrina&quot;, but other beetles, cutworm caterpillars (&quot;Agrotis species&quot;), psyllids, mole crickets (&quot;Gryllotalpa&quot;), and others cause significant damage. More than 100 species of insects are known to feed on melaleucas. Native stands have fewer predators, but tea tree sawfly (&quot;Pterygophorus&quot; species) and longicorn beetles are often found. The scale insect &quot;Beesonia ferrugineus&quot; forms round, fluffy-looking galls on branches of several &quot;Melaleuca&quot; species.

Melaleucas are also susceptible to myrtle rust (&quot;Puccinia psidii&quot;) which can result in damage to soft plant material and the death of highly susceptible hosts. Myrtle rust is common in eastern Australia, including Tasmania and has been detected in the Tiwi Islands.

===Invasive species===

&quot;Melaleuca quinquenervia&quot; (broad-leaved paperbark) is the most damaging of 60 exotic species introduced to the Florida Everglades to help drain low-lying swampy areas. Introduced in the early 20th century, it has become a serious invasive species, with damaging effects including the displacement of native species, reduction in wildlife habitat, alteration of hydrology, modification of soil, and changes in fire regimes. The tree&#x27;s perseverance in the face of efforts to eradicate it has earned it the nickname &quot;punktree&quot;.

==Uses==
===Traditional Aboriginal uses===
Aboriginal Australians used several species of &quot;Melaleuca&quot; to make rafts, as roofing for shelter, bandages, and food preparation. &quot;Bee bread&quot; and honey were collected from the hives of native stingless bees in melaleuca forests in the Northern Territory. The Bundjalung people traditionally lived in the area of north-eastern New South Wales where &quot;Melaleuca alternifolia&quot; is endemic, and they treated skin infections by crushing the leaves of that species over skin infections then covering the area with a warm mudpack.

===Essential oils===
&quot;Melaleuca alternifolia&quot; is notable for its essential oil, which has antifungal and antibiotic properties in vitro. Though it is safe for topical applications, tea tree oil is toxic if ingested orally.

The oil is produced on a commercial scale and marketed as tea tree oil. &quot;Melaleuca cajuputi&quot; is used to produce a similar oil, known as cajuput oil, which is used in Southeast Asia to treat a variety of infections and to add fragrance to food and soaps.

===Horticulture===
Melaleucas are popular garden plants, both in Australia and other tropical areas worldwide. The first to be cultivated were grown in England from seed in 1771. Some melaleucas are commonly cultivated, grown as trees for parks and large gardens (such as &quot;Melaleuca leucadendra&quot;) or as ornamentals (sometimes as &quot;Callistemon&quot;) such as &quot;M. citrina&quot; (&quot;Callistemon citrinus&quot;), &quot;M. hypericifolia&quot; and &quot;M. wilsonii&quot;.

===Melaleucas used in horticulture===
===In popular culture===
Tea trees (spelled &quot;Ti-Trees&quot;) are specifically mentioned in the lyrics of a short aria &#x27;Joy&#x27; published around 1916 by J.D.Fletcher &amp; Co of London, by Australian composer Arthur Chanter (1866-1950).

<text>Aristobulus III (53–36 BCE) was the last scion of the Hasmonean royal house, brother of Herod the Great&#x27;s wife Mariamne, and grandson of Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II. He was a favourite of the people on account of his noble descent and handsome presence, and thus became an object of fear to Herod, who at first sought to ignore him entirely by debarring him from the high priesthood. But his mother Alexandra, through intercession with Cleopatra and Mark Antony, compelled Herod to remove Ananelus from the office of high priest and appoint Aristobulus instead.

To secure himself against danger from Aristobulus, Herod instituted a system of espionage against him and his mother. This surveillance proved so onerous that they sought to gain their freedom by taking refuge with Cleopatra. As told by the Roman Jewish historian Josephus, their plans were betrayed, and the disclosure had the effect of greatly increasing Herod&#x27;s suspicions against his brother-in-law. As Herod dared not resort to open violence, he caused him to be drowned while he was bathing in a pool in Jericho during a banquet organized by Alexandra.

<text>Asher ben Jehiel (, or Asher ben Yechiel, sometimes Asheri) (1250 or 1259 – 1327) was an eminent rabbi and Talmudist best known for his abstract of Talmudic law. He is often referred to as Rabbenu Asher, “our Rabbi Asher” or by the Hebrew acronym for this title, the Rosh (). His yahrzeit is on 9 Cheshvan.

==Biography==
The Rosh was probably born in Cologne, Holy Roman Empire, and died in Toledo. His family was prominent for learning and piety, his father Yechiel was a Talmudist, and one of his ancestors was Rabbi Eliezer ben Nathan (the &quot;RaABaN&quot;). Asher had eight sons, the most prominent of whom were Jacob (author of the &quot;Arba&#x27;ah Turim&quot;) and Judah.

In 1286, King Rudolf I had instituted a new persecution of the Jews, and the great teacher of the Rosh, Rabbi Meir of Rothenburg, left Germany but was captured and imprisoned. The Rosh raised a ransom for his release, but Rabbi Meir refused it, for fear of encouraging the imprisonment of other rabbis. Thereafter the Rosh assumed Rabbi Meir&#x27;s position in Worms. He was, however, forced to emigrate (in all likelihood, a victim of blackmail by the government, aimed at acquiring his fortune). After leaving Germany, he first settled in southern France, and then in Toledo, Spain, where he became rabbi on the recommendation of Rabbi Solomon ben Abraham Aderet (&quot;RaShBA&quot;). Rabbenu Asher&#x27;s son Judah testified to the fact that he died in poverty. Rabbeinu Asher died in Toledo on 9 Cheshvan 5088 (1327 CE). His known surviving children were said to have been killed in the ensuing persecutions that affected Spain in 1392.

Rabbenu Asher possessed &quot;methodical and systematic&quot; Talmudic knowledge, and was distinguished for his ability to analyze and thereby clarify long Talmudic discussions. The Rosh was known for his independent legal reasoning: &quot;We must not be guided in our decisions by the admiration of great men, and in the event of a law not being clearly stated in the Talmud, we are not bound to accept it, even if it be based on the works of the Geonim.&quot; (For instance, the Rosh ruled that the liturgy of the Geonim was not subject to the Talmudic rule against change in the prayers.)

Rabbenu Asher was opposed to the study of secular knowledge, especially philosophy. He held that philosophy is based on critical research, whereas religion is based on tradition and the two are thus &quot;incapable of harmonization&quot;. He said that &quot;none that go unto her may return&quot;—in fact, he thanked God for having saved him from its influence, and boasted of possessing no knowledge outside the Torah. He attempted to issue a decree against the study of non-Jewish learning. One effect of this attitude was to limit his influence on secular Spanish Jewry. At the same time, within rabbinic circles, &quot;he transplanted the strict and narrow Talmudic spirit from Germany to Spain&quot;, and this, in some measure, turned Spanish Jews from secular research to the study of the Talmud.

==Works==
Rabbenu Asher&#x27;s best known work is his abstract of Talmudic law. This work specifies the final, practical &quot;halakha&quot;, leaving out the intermediate discussion and concisely stating the final decision. It omits areas of law limited to &quot;Eretz Yisrael&quot; (such as agricultural and sacrificial laws) as well as the &quot;aggadic&quot; portions of the Talmud. Asher&#x27;s son Jacob compiled a list of the decisions found in the work, under the title &quot;Piskei Ha-Rosh&quot; (decisions of the Rosh). Commentaries on his &quot;Halachot&quot; were written by a number of later Talmudists. In &quot;yeshivot,&quot; this work is studied as a regular part of the daily Talmud study.

This work resembles the &quot;Hilchot&quot; of the Rif (Rabbi Isaac Alfasi)—also an adumbration—but differs in quoting later authorities: Maimonides, the Tosafists and Alfasi himself. One theory states that the work is actually not a commentary on the &quot;Talmud&quot; but is rather a commentary on the &quot;Rif&quot;, given that it always starts with the text of the &quot;Rif&quot;. Some however dispute this.

Rabbenu Asher&#x27;s work has been printed with almost every edition of the Talmud since its publication. This work was so important in Jewish law that Yosef Karo included the Rosh together with Maimonides and Isaac Alfasi as one of the three major &quot;poskim&quot; (decisors) considered in determining the final ruling in his &quot;Shulchan Arukh.&quot;

Rabbi Asher also wrote:
*&quot;Orchot Chaim&quot;, an essay on ethics, written for his sons. It begins with the comment, “Distance yourself from haughtiness, with the essence of distancing.” &quot;Orchot Chaim&quot; is today an important work of musar literature.
*A commentary on &quot;Zeraim&quot; (the first order of the &quot;Mishnah&quot;)—with the exception of Tractate &quot;Berachot.&quot;
*A commentary on &quot;Tohorot&quot; (the sixth order of the &quot;Mishnah&quot;).
*The &quot;Tosefot ha-Rosh&quot;, Tosafot-like glosses on the Talmud.
*A volume of &quot;responsa&quot;; see History of Responsa: Fourteenth century.
* There is a volume of responsa entitled &#x27;Besamim Rosh&#x27; which is falsely attributed to the Rosh. In fact it has been shown to be a forgery from the 18th century, and contains controversial decisions which contradict what the Rosh wrote in his (genuine) responsa. This collection was published by Saul Berlin, Tzvi Hirsch Levin&#x27;s son. It was exposed as a forgery by Mordecai Benet (amongst others)
*A commentary on the Torah which often uses mystical interpretations such as using gematria and acronyms similar to his son Jacob ben Asher more famous work Rimzei Ba&#x27;al ha-Turim.

== Influence ==
During the Toledo era of Spanish Jewish history, the influence of R. Asher ben Jehiel and his followers, who maintained a distinctly Talmudic rabbinic approach, was significant. However, the wider intellectual Jewish culture was deeply drawn to philosophy, with Zaragoza emerging as a prominent center where philosophy was studied alongside Talmudic scholarship within the local &quot;yeshivas&quot;.

<text>Rav Ashi () (&quot;Rabbi Ashi&quot;) (352–427) was a Babylonian Jewish rabbi, of the sixth generation of amoraim. He reestablished the Academy at Sura and was the first editor of the Babylonian Talmud.

The original pronunciation of his name may have been &quot;Asheh&quot;, as suggested by the rhyming of his name with &quot;Mosheh&quot; in Maimonides&#x27; writings, and a possible rhyme with the word &quot;mikdashei&quot; () in the Talmud itself.

==Biography==
According to a tradition preserved in the academies, Rav Ashi was born in the same year that Rava (the great teacher of Mahuza) died, and he was the first important teacher in the Talmudic Academies in Babylonia after Rava&#x27;s death. Simai, Ashi&#x27;s father, was a rich and learned man, a student of the college of Naresh near Sura, which was directed by Rav Pappa, Rava&#x27;s disciple. Ashi&#x27;s teacher was Rav Kahana III, a member of the same college, who later became president of the academy at Pumbedita. Ashi married the daughter of Rami bar Hama, or Rami b. Abba according to other texts.

Ashi was rich and influential, owning many properties and forests. The Talmud gives him as an example of &quot;Torah and greatness combined in one place&quot;, that is to say, he possessed both scholarly accomplishment and political authority, and he had authority even over the exilarch Huna bar Nathan.

=== Elevation of Sura ===

While still young, Rav Ashi became the head of the Sura Academy, his great learning being acknowledged by the older teachers. It had been closed since Rav Chisda&#x27;s death (309), but under Rav Ashi it once again became the intellectual center of the Babylonian Jews. Ashi contributed to its material grandeur also, rebuilding the academy and the synagogue connected with it in Mata Mehasya, sparing no expense and personally superintending their reconstruction. As a direct result of Rav Ashi&#x27;s renown, the Exilarch came annually to Sura in the month after Rosh Hashana to receive the respects of the assembled representatives of the Babylonian academies and congregations. These festivities and other conventions in Sura were so splendid that Rav Ashi expressed his surprise that some of the Gentile residents of Sura were not tempted to accept Judaism.

Sura maintained the prominence conferred on it by Rav Ashi for several centuries, and only during the last two centuries of the Gaonic period did Pumbedita again become its rival. Rav Ashi&#x27;s son Tabyomi (known as Mar bar Rav Ashi) was a recognized scholar, but only in 455, 28 years after his father&#x27;s death, did he receive the position that his father had so successfully filled for more than half a century.

=== Compilation of the Gemara===
His commanding personality, his scholarly standing, and wealth are sufficiently indicated by the saying, then current, that since the days of Rabbi Judah haNasi, learning and social distinction were never so united in one person as in Rav Ashi. Indeed, just as Judah haNasi compiled and edited the Mishnah; Rav Ashi made it the labor of his life to collect and edit under the name of Gemara, the explanations of the Mishnah which had been taught in the Babylonian academies since the days of Rav, together with all the discussions connected with them, and all the halakhic and aggadic material covered in the schools.

Together with his disciples and the scholars who gathered in Sura for the &quot;Kallah&quot;, or semi-annual college conference, he completed this task. The kindly attitude of King Yazdegerd I, as well as the devoted and respectful recognition of his authority by the academies of Nehardea and Pumbedita, greatly favored the undertaking. A particularly important element in Ashi&#x27;s success was the length of his tenure of office as head of Sura Academy. According to a tradition brought by Hai Gaon, he held the position for 60 years, though given his approximately 75-year lifespan it is possible this number was rounded upwards. According to the same tradition, these 60 years were so symmetrically apportioned that each tractate required six months (including a single Kallah) for the study of its Mishnah and the redaction of the traditional expositions of the same (Gemara), totaling 30 years for the 60 tractates. The same process was repeated in the next 30 years. Indeed, the Talmud itself mentions an earlier and a later version of Rav Ashi&#x27;s teachings on at least one subject.

Beyond this, the Talmud itself contains not the slightest intimation of the activity which Ashi and his school exercised in this field for more than half a century. Even whether this editorial work was written down, and thus, whether the putting of the Babylonian Talmud into writing took place under Rav Ashi or not, cannot be answered from any statement in the Talmud. It is nevertheless probable that the fixation of the text of so comprehensive a literary work could not have been accomplished without the aid of writing. Rav Ashi often provides comments at the very end of broad Talmudic discussions, occasionally providing conclusions to issues that remain unresolved up to that point.

The work begun by Rav Ashi was continued in the two succeeding generations and completed by Ravina II, another president of the college at Sura, who died in 499. To the work as Ravina left it, only slight additions were made by the Saboraim. To one of these additions—that to an ancient utterance concerning the &quot;Book of Adam, the First Man,&quot;—this statement is appended: &quot;Rav Ashi and Ravina are the last representatives of independent decision (&quot;hora&#x27;ah&quot;)&quot;, an evident reference to the work of these two in editing the Babylonian Talmud, which as an object of study and a fountainhead of practical &quot;decision&quot; was to have the same importance for the coming generations as the Mishnah had had for the Amoraim.

==Teachings==
* A talmid chacham who is not as strong as iron is not a talmid chacham.
* Whoever is arrogant is blemished.

==Tomb of Rav Ashi==
Some ultra-Orthodox Jews from the Breslov Hasidic sect belief, Rav Ashi is buried at a site, which sits on the Lebanese Mount Shanan on the border with Israel overlooking Kibbutz Manara. 

Local Lebanese people dispute this, they belief that a 16th century Shia Muslim cleric named Sheikh Abbad is buried there. Sheikh Abbad is considered a founder of the Shi&#x27;ite movement in Lebanon. 

In May 2000, when Israel withdrew from South Lebanon, after the Israeli occupation of Southern Lebanon (19852–2000) the main obstacle holding up the deployment of United Nations peacekeepers (UNIFIL) along the border was the allocation of this disputed site. It was among the last to be settled between the State of Israel and Lebanon. One option was to erect a barricade around the tomb to prevent Muslims and Jews from visiting the site. Subsequent to the Blue Line drawn by the United Nations, the border fence cuts through the middle of the disputed tomb.

In February 2025, during the fragile Israel–Lebanon ceasefire after Israeli invasion of Lebanon, it became public that a group of Haredi Israelis illegally infiltrated into Lebanese territory to reach the believed tomb. The intruders undertook work on the grave and fenced it off. They tried to turn it into a place for prayer and worship. It was not specify when these individuals began their infiltration, nor the period of time they spent inside Lebanon, and no official Lebanese statement was issued in this regard.

<text>The International Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet or simply the Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet, commonly known as the NATO phonetic alphabet, is the most widely used set of clear-code words for communicating the letters of the Roman alphabet. Technically a &quot;radiotelephonic spelling alphabet,&quot; it goes by various names, including NATO spelling alphabet, ICAO phonetic alphabet, and ICAO spelling alphabet. The ITU phonetic alphabet and figure code is a rarely used variant that differs in the code words for digits.

Although spelling alphabets are commonly called &quot;phonetic alphabets&quot;, they are not phonetic in the sense of phonetic transcription systems such as the International Phonetic Alphabet.

To create the code, a series of international agencies assigned 26 clear-code words (also known as &quot;phonetic words&quot;) acrophonically to the letters of the Roman alphabet, with the goal that the letters and numbers would be easily distinguishable from one another over radio and telephone. The words were chosen to be accessible to speakers of English, French and Spanish. Some of the code words were changed over time, as they were found to be ineffective in real-life conditions. In 1956, NATO modified the then-current set used by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO); this modification then became the international standard when it was accepted by ICAO that year and by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) a few years later. 

The 26 code words are as follows (ICAO spellings): &quot;&quot;, &quot;Bravo&quot;, &quot;Charlie&quot;, &quot;Delta&quot;, &quot;Echo&quot;, &quot;Foxtrot&quot;, &quot;Golf&quot;, &quot;Hotel&quot;, &quot;India&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Kilo&quot;, &quot;Lima&quot;, &quot;Mike&quot;, &quot;November&quot;, &quot;Oscar&quot;, &quot;Papa&quot;, &quot;Quebec&quot;, &quot;Romeo&quot;, &quot;Sierra&quot;, &quot;Tango&quot;, &quot;Uniform&quot;, &quot;Victor&quot;, &quot;Whiskey&quot;, &quot;X-ray&quot;, &quot;Yankee&quot;, and &quot;Zulu&quot;. and are spelled that way to avoid mispronunciation by people unfamiliar with English orthography; NATO changed to for the same reason. The code words for digits are their English names, though with their pronunciations modified in the cases of &quot;three&quot;, &quot;four&quot;, &quot;five&quot;, &quot;nine&quot; and &quot;thousand&quot;.

The code words have been stable since 1956. A 1955 NATO memo stated that:

==International adoption==
Soon after the code words were developed by ICAO (see history below), they were adopted by other national and international organizations, including the ITU, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the United States Federal Government as Federal Standard 1037C: Glossary of Telecommunications Terms and its successors ANSI T1.523-2001 and ATIS Telecom Glossary (ATIS-0100523.2019) (all three using the spellings &quot;Alpha&quot; and &quot;Juliet&quot;), the United States Department of Defense, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) (using the spelling &quot;Xray&quot;), the International Amateur Radio Union (IARU), the American Radio Relay League (ARRL), the Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International (APCO), and by many military organizations such as NATO (using the spelling &quot;Xray&quot;) and the now-defunct Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO).

The same alphabetic code words are used by all agencies, but each agency chooses one of two different sets of numeric code words. NATO uses the regular English numerals (&quot;zero&quot;, &quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, etc., though with some differences in pronunciation), whereas the ITU (beginning on 1 April 1969) and the IMO created compound code words (&quot;nadazero&quot;, &quot;unaone&quot;, &quot;bissotwo&quot; etc.). In practice the compound words are used very rarely. 

==Usage==

A spelling alphabet is used to distinguish those parts of a message that contain letters and digits, because the names of many letters sound similar, for instance &quot;bee&quot; and &quot;pee&quot;, &quot;en&quot; and &quot;em&quot; or &quot;ef&quot; and &quot;ess&quot;. The potential for confusion increases if static or other interference is present, as is commonly the case with radio and telephonic communication. For instance, the target message &quot;proceed to map grid DH98&quot; would be transmitted as &quot;proceed to map grid Delta-Hotel-Niner-Ait&quot;. 

Civilian industry uses the code words to avoid similar problems in the transmission of messages by telephone systems. For example, it is often used in the retail industry where customer or site details are conveyed by telephone (for example to authorize a credit agreement or confirm stock codes), although ad-hoc code words are often used in that instance. It has been used by information technology workers to communicate serial numbers and reference codes, which are often very long, by voice. Most major airlines use the alphabet to communicate passenger name records (PNRs) internally, and in some cases, with customers. It is often used in a medical context as well.

Several codes words and sequences of code words have become well-known, such as Bravo Zulu (letter code BZ) for &quot;well done&quot;, Checkpoint Charlie (Checkpoint C) in Berlin, and Zulu Time for Greenwich Mean Time or Coordinated Universal Time. During the Vietnam War, the US government referred to the Viet Cong guerrillas and the group itself as VC, or Victor Charlie; the name &quot;Charlie&quot; became synonymous with this force.

==Pronunciation of code words==
The final choice of code words for the letters of the alphabet and for the digits was made after hundreds of thousands of comprehension tests involving 31 nationalities. The qualifying feature was the likelihood of a code word being understood in the context of others. For example, &quot;Football&quot; has a higher chance of being understood than &quot;Foxtrot&quot; in isolation, but &quot;Foxtrot&quot; is superior in extended communication.

Pronunciations were set out by the ICAO before 1956 with advice from the governments of both the United States and United Kingdom. To eliminate national variations in pronunciation, posters illustrating the pronunciation desired by ICAO are available. However, there remain differences in the pronunciations published by ICAO and other agencies, and ICAO has apparently conflicting Latin-alphabet and IPA transcriptions. At least some of these differences appear to be typographic errors. In 2022 the Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN) attempted to resolve these conflicts. For example, they consistently transcribe for what the ICAO had transcribed variously as in IPA and as &quot;a, ah, ar, er&quot; in orthography. 

Just as words are spelled out as individual letters, numbers are spelled out as individual digits. That is, 17 is rendered as &quot;one seven&quot; and 60 as &quot;six zero&quot;. Depending on context, the word &quot;thousand&quot; may be used as in English, and for whole hundreds only (when the sequence 00 occurs at the end of a number), the word &quot;hundred&quot; may be used. For example, 1300 is read as &quot;one three zero zero&quot; if it is a transponder code or serial number, and as &quot;one thousand three hundred&quot; if it is an altitude or distance.

The ICAO, NATO, and FAA use modifications of English digits as code words, with 3, 4, 5 and 9 being pronounced &quot;tree&quot;, &quot;fower&quot; (rhymes with &quot;lower&quot;), &quot;fife&quot; and &quot;niner&quot;. The digit 3 is specified as &quot;tree&quot; so that it will not be mispronounced &quot;sri&quot; (and similarly for &quot;thousand&quot;); the long pronunciation of 4 (still found in some English dialects) keeps it somewhat distinct from &quot;for&quot;; 5 is pronounced with a second &quot;f&quot; because the normal pronunciation with a &quot;v&quot; is easily confused with &quot;fire&quot;; and 9 has an extra syllable to keep it distinct from the German word &quot;nein&quot; &quot;no&quot;. (Prior to 1956, &quot;three&quot; and &quot;five&quot; had been pronounced with the English consonants, but with the vowels broken into two syllables.) For directions presented as the hour-hand position on a clock, the additional numerals &quot;ten&quot;, &quot;eleven&quot; and &quot;twelve&quot; are used with the word &quot;o&#x27;clock&quot;.

The ITU and IMO, however, specify a different set of code words. These are compounds of ICAO and Latinesque roots.
The IMO&#x27;s GMDSS procedures permits the use of either set of code words.

===Tables===
There are two IPA transcriptions of the letter names, from the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN). Both authorities indicate that a non-rhotic pronunciation is standard. That of the ICAO, first published in 1950 and reprinted many times without correction (e.g. the error in &#x27;golf&#x27;), uses a large number of vowels. For instance, it has six low/central vowels: . The DIN consolidated all six into the single low-central vowel . The DIN vowels are partly predictable, with in closed syllables and in open syllables apart from &quot;echo&quot; and &quot;sierra&quot;, which have as in English, German and Italian. The DIN also reduced the number of stressed syllables in &quot;bravo&quot; and &quot;x-ray&quot;, consistent with the ICAO English respellings of those words and with the NATO change of spelling of &quot;x-ray&quot; to &quot;xray&quot; so that people would know to pronounce it as a single word.

There is no authoritative IPA transcription of the digits. However, there are respellings into both English and French, which can be compared to clarify some of the ambiguities and inconsistencies. 
CCEB has code words for punctuation, including those in the table below.
Others are: &quot;colon&quot;, &quot;semi-colon&quot;, &quot;exclamation mark&quot;, &quot;question mark&quot;, &quot;apostrophe&quot;, &quot;quote&quot;, and &quot;unquote&quot;.

==History==
Prior to World War I and the development and widespread adoption of two-way radio that supported voice, telephone spelling alphabets were developed to improve communication on low-quality and long-distance telephone circuits.

The first non-military internationally recognized spelling alphabet was adopted by the CCIR (predecessor of the ITU) during 1927. The experience gained with that alphabet resulted in several changes being made during 1932 by the ITU. The resulting alphabet was adopted by the International Commission for Air Navigation, the predecessor of the ICAO, and was used for civil aviation until World War II. It continued to be used by the IMO until 1965.

Throughout World War II, many nations used their own versions of a spelling alphabet. The US adopted the Joint Army/Navy radiotelephony alphabet during 1941 to standardize systems among all branches of its armed forces. The US alphabet became known as &quot;Able Baker&quot; after the words for A and B. The Royal Air Force adopted one similar to the United States one during World War II as well. Other British forces adopted the RAF radio alphabet, which is similar to the phonetic alphabet used by the Royal Navy during World War I. At least two of the terms are sometimes still used by UK civilians to spell words over the phone, namely &quot;F for Freddie&quot; and &quot;S for Sugar&quot;.

To enable the US, UK, and Australian armed forces to communicate during joint operations, in 1943 the CCB (Combined Communications Board; the combination of US and UK upper military commands) modified the US military&#x27;s Joint Army/Navy alphabet for use by all three nations, with the result being called the US-UK spelling alphabet. It was defined in one or more of CCBP-1: &quot;Combined Amphibious Communications Instructions&quot;, CCBP3: &quot;Combined Radiotelephone (R/T) Procedure&quot;, and CCBP-7: &quot;Combined Communication Instructions.&quot; The CCB alphabet itself was based on the US Joint Army/Navy spelling alphabet. The CCBP (Combined Communications Board Publications) documents contain material formerly published in US Army Field Manuals in the 24-series. Several of these documents had revisions, and were renamed. For instance, CCBP3-2 was the second edition of CCBP3.

During World War II, the US military conducted significant research into spelling alphabets. Major F. D. Handy, directorate of Communications in the Army Air Force (and a member of the working committee of the Combined Communications Board), enlisted the help of Harvard University&#x27;s Psycho-Acoustic Laboratory, asking them to determine the most successful word for each letter when using &quot;military interphones in the intense noise encountered in modern warfare.&quot; He included lists from the US, Royal Air Force, Royal Navy, British Army, AT&amp;T, Western Union, RCA Communications, and that of the International Telecommunications Convention. According to a report on the subject:

After World War II, with many aircraft and ground personnel from the allied armed forces, &quot;Able Baker&quot; was officially adopted for use in international aviation. During the 1946 Second Session of the ICAO Communications Division, the organization adopted the so-called &quot;Able Baker&quot; alphabet that was the 1943 US–UK spelling alphabet. However, many sounds were unique to English, so an alternative &quot;Ana Brazil&quot; alphabet was used in Latin America. In spite of this, International Air Transport Association (IATA), recognizing the need for a single universal alphabet, presented a draft alphabet to the ICAO during 1947 that had sounds common to English, French, Spanish and Portuguese.

From 1948 to 1949, Jean-Paul Vinay, a professor of linguistics at the Université de Montréal, worked closely with the ICAO to research and develop a new spelling alphabet. The directions of ICAO were that &quot;To be considered, a word must:
# Be a live word in each of the three working languages.
# Be easily pronounced and recognized by airmen of all languages.
# Have good radio transmission and readability characteristics.
# Have a similar spelling in at least English, French, and Spanish, and the initial letter must be the letter the word identifies.
# Be free from any association with objectionable meanings.&quot;
After further study and modification by each approving body, the revised alphabet was adopted on , to become effective on 1 April 1952 for civil aviation (but it may not have been adopted by any military).

Problems were soon found with this list. Some users believed that they were so severe that they reverted to the old &quot;Able Baker&quot; alphabet. Confusion among words like &quot;Delta&quot; and &quot;Extra&quot;, and between &quot;Nectar&quot; and &quot;Victor&quot;, or the poor intelligibility of other words during poor receiving conditions were the main problems. Later in 1952, ICAO decided to revisit the alphabet and their research. To identify the deficiencies of the new alphabet, testing was conducted among speakers from 31 nations, principally by the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States. In the United States, the research was conducted by the USAF-directed Operational Applications Laboratory (AFCRC, ARDC), to monitor a project with the Research Foundation of Ohio State University. Among the more interesting of the research findings was that &quot;higher noise levels do not create confusion, but do intensify those confusions already inherent between the words in question&quot;.

By early 1956 the ICAO was nearly complete with this research, and published the new official phonetic alphabet in order to account for discrepancies that might arise in communications as a result of multiple alphabet naming systems coexisting in different places and organizations. NATO was in the process of adopting the ICAO spelling alphabet, and apparently felt enough urgency that it adopted the proposed new alphabet with changes based on NATO&#x27;s own research, to become effective on 1 January 1956, but quickly issued a new directive on 1 March 1956 adopting the now official ICAO spelling alphabet, which had changed by one word (November) from NATO&#x27;s earlier request to ICAO to modify a few words based on US Air Force research.

After all of the above study, only the five words representing the letters C, M, N, U, and X were replaced. The ICAO sent a recording of the new &quot;Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet&quot; to all member states in November 1955. The final version given in the table above was implemented by the ICAO on , and the ITU adopted it no later than 1959 when they mandated its usage via their official publication, &quot;Radio Regulations&quot;. Because the ITU governs all international radio communications, it was also adopted by most radio operators, whether military, civilian, or amateur. It was finally adopted by the IMO in 1965.

During 1947 the ITU adopted the compound Latinate prefix-number words (&quot;Nadazero&quot;, &quot;Unaone&quot;, etc.), later adopted by the IMO during 1965.
* Nadazero – from Spanish or Portuguese nada + NATO/ICAO zero 
* Unaone – generic Romance una, from Latin ūna + NATO/ICAO one
* Bissotwo – from Latin bis + NATO/ICAO two. (1959 ITU proposals bis and too)
* Terrathree – from Italian terzo + NATO/ICAO three (&quot;tree&quot;) (1959 ITU proposals ter and tree)
* Kartefour – from French quatre (Latin quartus) + NATO/ICAO four (&quot;fow-er&quot;) (1959 ITU proposals quarto and fow-er)
* Pantafive – from Greek penta- + NATO/ICAO five (&quot;fife&quot;) (From 1959 ITU proposals penta and fife)
* Soxisix – from French soix + NATO/ICAO six (1959 ITU proposals were saxo and six)
* Setteseven – from Italian sette + NATO/ICAO seven (1959 ITU proposals sette and sev-en)
* Oktoeight – generic Romance octo-, from Latin octō + NATO/ICAO eight (1959 ITU proposals octo and ait)
* Novenine – from Italian nove + NATO/ICAO nine (&quot;niner&quot;) (1959 ITU proposals were nona and niner)

In the official version of the alphabet, two spellings deviate from the English norm: &quot;Alfa&quot; and &quot;Juliett&quot;. &quot;Alfa&quot; is spelled with an &quot;f&quot; as it is in most European languages because the spelling &quot;Alpha&quot; may not be pronounced properly by native speakers of some languages – who may not know that &quot;ph&quot; should be pronounced as &quot;f&quot;. The spelling &quot;Juliett&quot; is used rather than &quot;Juliet&quot; for the benefit of French speakers, because they may otherwise treat a single final &quot;t&quot; as silent. For similar reasons, &quot;Charlie&quot; and &quot;Uniform&quot; have alternative pronunciations where the &quot;ch&quot; is pronounced &quot;sh&quot; and the &quot;u&quot; is pronounced &quot;oo&quot;. Early on, the NATO alliance changed &quot;X-ray&quot; to &quot;Xray&quot; in its version of the alphabet to ensure that it would be pronounced as one word rather than as two, while the global organization ICAO keeps the spelling &quot;X-ray&quot;.

The alphabet is defined by various international conventions on radio, including:
* Universal Electrical Communications Union (UECU), Washington, D.C., December 1920
* International Radiotelegraph Convention, Washington, 1927 (which created the CCIR)
* General Radiocommunication and Additional Regulations (Madrid, 1932)
* Instructions for the International Telephone Service, 1932 (ITU-T E.141; withdrawn in 1993)
* General Radiocommunication Regulations and Additional Radiocommunication Regulations (Cairo, 1938)
* Radio Regulations and Additional Radio Regulations (Atlantic City, 1947), where &quot;it was decided that the International Civil Aviation Organization and other international aeronautical organizations would assume the responsibility for procedures and regulations related to aeronautical communication. However, ITU would continue to maintain general procedures regarding distress signals.&quot;
* 1959 Administrative Radio Conference (Geneva, 1959)
* International Telecommunication Union, Radio
* Final Acts of WARC-79 (Geneva, 1979). Here the alphabet was formally named &quot;Phonetic Alphabet and Figure Code&quot;.
* International Code of Signals for Visual, Sound, and Radio Communications, United States Edition, 1969 (revised 2003)

===Tables===

For the 1938 and 1947 phonetics, each transmission of figures is preceded and followed by the words &quot;as a number&quot; spoken twice.

The ITU adopted the IMO phonetic spelling alphabet in 1959, and in 1969 specified that it be &quot;for application in the maritime mobile service only&quot;.

Pronunciation was not defined prior to 1959. For the post-1959 phonetics, the underlined syllable of each letter word should be emphasized, and each syllable of the code words for the post-1969 figures should be equally emphasized.

=== International aviation ===

The Radiotelephony Spelling Alphabet is used by the International Civil Aviation Organization for international aircraft communications.

=== International maritime mobile service ===
The ITU-R Radiotelephony Alphabet is used by the International Maritime Organization for international marine communications.

==Variants==
Since &quot;Nectar&quot; was changed to &quot;November&quot; in 1956, the code has been mostly stable. However, there is occasional regional substitution of a few code words, such as replacing them with earlier variants, to avoid confusion with local terminology.
*As of 2013, it was reported that &quot;Delta&quot; was often replaced by &quot;David&quot; or &quot;Dixie&quot; at Atlanta International Airport, where Delta Air Lines is based, because &quot;Delta&quot; is also the airline&#x27;s callsign. Air traffic control once referred to Taxiway D at the same airport as &quot;Taxiway Dixie&quot;, though this practice was officially discontinued in 2020.
*&quot;Foxtrot&quot; may be shortened to &quot;Fox&quot; at airports in the United States.
*British police use &quot;Indigo&quot; rather than &quot;India&quot;.
*In Indonesia, &quot;London&quot; is used in place of &quot;Lima&quot;, because &quot;lima&quot; is the Malay word for &#x27;five&#x27;.
*It has been reported that &quot;Hawk&quot; is sometimes used for &quot;Hotel&quot; in the Philippines.

<doc id="59046" wikidata="Q1529908" url="?curid=59046" title="Silly Putty">
<text>Silly Putty is a toy containing silicone polymers that have unusual physical properties. It can flow like a liquid, bounce and can be stretched or broken depending on the amount of physical stress to which it is subjected. It contains viscoelastic liquid silicones, a type of non-Newtonian fluid, which makes it act as a viscous liquid over a long period of time but as an elastic solid over a short time period. It was originally created during research into a potential rubber substitute for use by the United States in World War II.

The name &quot;Silly Putty&quot; is a trademark of Crayola LLC. Other names are used to market similar substances from other manufacturers.

==Description==
As a bouncing putty, Silly Putty is noted for its unusual characteristics. It bounces when dropped from a height, but breaks when struck or stretched sharply; it can also float in a liquid and will form a puddle given enough time. Silly Putty and most other retail putty products have viscoelastic agents added to reduce the flow and enable the putty to hold its shape.

The original coral-colored Silly Putty is composed of 65% dimethylsiloxane (hydroxy-terminated polymers with boric acid), 17% silica (crystalline quartz), 9% Thixatrol ST (castor oil derivative), 4% polydimethylsiloxane, 1% decamethyl cyclopentasiloxane, 1% glycerine, and 1% titanium dioxide.

Silly Putty&#x27;s unusual flow characteristics are due to the ingredient polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), a viscoelastic substance. Viscoelasticity is a type of non-Newtonian flow, characterizing a material that acts as a viscous liquid over a long time period but as an elastic solid over a short time period. Because its apparent viscosity increases directly with respect to the amount of force applied, Silly Putty can be characterized as a dilatant fluid.

Silly Putty is also a fairly good adhesive. When newspaper ink was petroleum based, Silly Putty could be used to transfer newspaper images to other surfaces, providing amusement by distorting the transferred image afterwards. Newer papers with soy-based inks are more resistant to this process.

Generally, Silly Putty is difficult to remove from textured items such as dirt and clothing. Hand sanitizers containing alcohol are often helpful. Silly Putty will dissolve when in contact with an alcohol; after the alcohol evaporates, the material will not exhibit its original properties.

If Silly Putty is submerged in warm or hot water, it will become softer and thus &quot;melt&quot; much faster. It also becomes harder to remove small amounts of it from surfaces. After a long period of time, it will return to its original viscosity.

Silly Putty is sold as a piece of clay inside an egg-shaped plastic container. The Silly Putty brand is owned by Crayola LLC (formerly the Binney &amp; Smith company). , twenty thousand eggs of Silly Putty are sold daily. Since 1950, more than 300 million eggs of Silly Putty (approximately ) have been sold. It is available in various colors, including glow-in-the-dark and metallic. Other brands offer similar materials, sometimes in larger-sized containers, and in a similarly wide variety of colors or with different properties, such as magnetism and iridescence.

==History==
During World War II, Japan invaded rubber-producing countries as it expanded its sphere of influence in the Pacific Rim. Rubber was vital for the production of rafts, tires, vehicle and aircraft parts, gas masks, and boots. In the US, all rubber products were rationed; citizens were encouraged to make their rubber products last until the end of the war and to donate spare tires, boots, and coats. Meanwhile, the government funded research into synthetic rubber compounds to attempt to solve this shortage.

Credit for the invention of Silly Putty is disputed and has been attributed variously to Earl Warrick of the then newly formed Dow Corning; Harvey Chin; and James Wright, a Scottish-born inventor working for General Electric in New Haven, Connecticut. Throughout his life, Warrick insisted that he and his colleague, Rob Roy McGregor, received the patent for Silly Putty before Wright did; but Crayola&#x27;s history of Silly Putty states that Wright first invented it in 1943. Both researchers independently discovered that reacting boric acid with silicone oil would produce a gooey, bouncy material with several unique properties. The non-toxic putty would bounce when dropped, could stretch farther than regular rubber, would not go moldy, and had a very high melting temperature. However, the substance did not have all the properties needed to replace rubber.

In 1949, toy store owner Ruth Fallgatter came across the putty. She contacted marketing consultant Peter C. L. Hodgson (1912–1976). The two decided to market the bouncing putty by selling it in a clear case. Although it sold well, Fallgatter did not pursue it further. However, Hodgson saw its potential.

Already US$12,000 in debt, Hodgson borrowed $147 to buy a batch of the putty to pack portions into plastic eggs for $1, calling it Silly Putty. Initial sales were poor, but after a &quot;New Yorker&quot; article mentioned it, Hodgson sold over 250,000 eggs of silly putty in three days. However, Hodgson was almost put out of business in 1951 by the Korean War. Silicone, the main ingredient in silly putty, was put on ration, harming his business. A year later, the restriction on silicone was lifted and the production of Silly Putty resumed. Initially, it was primarily targeted towards adults. However, by 1955, the majority of its customers were aged six to twelve. In 1957, Hodgson produced the first televised commercial for Silly Putty, which aired during the &quot;Howdy Doody Show&quot;.

In 1961, Silly Putty went worldwide, becoming a hit in the Soviet Union and Europe. In 1968, it was taken into lunar orbit by the Apollo 8 astronauts.

Peter Hodgson died in 1976. A year later, Binney &amp; Smith, the makers of Crayola products, acquired the rights to Silly Putty. , annual Silly Putty sales exceeded six million eggs.

Silly Putty was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame on May 28, 2001.

==Other uses==
In addition to its success as a toy, other uses for the putty have been found. In the home, it can be used to remove substances such as dirt, lint, pet hair, or ink from various surfaces. The material&#x27;s unique properties have found niche use in medical and scientific applications. Occupational therapists use it for rehabilitative therapy of hand injuries. A number of other brands (such as &quot;Power Putty&quot; and &quot;TheraPutty&quot;) alter the material&#x27;s properties, offering different levels of resistance. The material is also used as a tool to help reduce stress, and exists in various viscosities based on the user&#x27;s preference.

Because of its adhesive characteristics, it was used by Apollo astronauts to secure their tools in zero gravity. Scale model building hobbyists use the putty as a masking medium when spray-painting model assemblies. The Steward Observatory uses a Silly-Putty backed lap to polish astronomical telescope mirrors.

Researchers from Trinity College Dublin School of Physics (Centre for Research on Adaptive Nanostructures and Nanodevices (CRANN) and Advanced Materials and Bioengineering Research (AMBER) Research Centers) have discovered nano composite mixtures of graphene and Silly Putty behave as sensitive pressure sensors, claiming the ability to measure the footsteps of a spider crawling on it.

The Wiradjuri (Wiradjuri northern dialect pronunciation [wiraːjd̪uːraj]) or Wirraayjuurray people (Wiradjuri southern dialect pronunciation [wiraːjɟuːraj]) people were the first known humans to occupy the area, and are a group of Indigenous Australian Aboriginal people that were united by a common language, strong ties of kinship and survived as skilled hunter–fisher–gatherers in family groups or clans scattered throughout central New South Wales.

In the 21st century, major Wiradjuri groups live in Condobolin, Peak Hill, Narrandera and Griffith. There are significant populations at Wagga Wagga and Leeton and smaller groups at West Wyalong, Parkes, Dubbo, Forbes, Cootamundra, Cowra and Young.

===European exploration===
The explorers Hume and Hovell arrived at what their maps called &#x27;Crossing Point&#x27;, but is now known as the Murray River at Albury, on 16 November 1824. They named the river the &quot;Hume River&quot;, after Hume&#x27;s father, and the next day inscribed a tree by the river bank before continuing their journey south to Westernport in Victoria. In 1830, explorer Captain Charles Sturt discovered the Hume River downstream at its junction with the Murrumbidgee River. Not realising it was the same river, he named it the Murray River. Both names persisted for some time, Hume falling into disuse eventually in favour of Murray. The Aboriginal name for the river was &quot;Millewa&quot;. A crossing place for the Murray became popular close to where Hovell inscribed the tree. In summer it was usually possible to cross the river by foot.

===British settlement===
Among the first squatters to follow in the steps of the explorers and settle in the district were William Wyse and Charles Ebden.

The first European buildings erected at the crossing place were a provisions store and some small huts. A survey for a town was commissioned in 1838 by Assistant Surveyor Thomas Townsend who mapped out Wodonga Place (the present Wodonga Place) as the western boundary, Hume Street as the northern boundary, Kiewa Street to the east and Nurigong Street to the south, with Townsend Street being the only other north–south road, and Ebden and Hovell Streets being the two other east–west roads. Townsend proposed the settlement be named &#x27;Bungambrawatha &#x27;, the Aboriginal name for the area, but when his plan was eventually approved and published in the Government Gazette on 13 April 1839 the name had been changed to Albury.

Albury is said to be named after a village in Kent, England which it apparently resembled, though that referenced publication seems incorrect since there is no Albury in Kent. More plausible is Albury in adjacent Surrey, straddling the Tillingbourne river and a significant 18th century site of mills and industry.

===Frontier town===

By 1847 the Albury settlement included two public houses and a handful of huts, a police barracks and a blacksmiths. A log punt established in 1844 serviced the crossing of the Murray River. Albury Post Office opened on 1 April 1843, closed in 1845, then reopened in the township on 1 February 1847.

In 1851, with the separation of Victoria from New South Wales, and the border falling on the Murray River, Albury found itself a frontier town. With an increase in commerce with Melbourne, the first bridge was built in 1860 to the design of surveyor William Snell Chauncy. Albury at this time became a customs post between the two colonies as New South Wales held a protectionist stance after gaining its constitution in 1856.

Albury was at this time starting to grow substantially with German speaking immigrants using the area to grow grapes for wine. By the 1870s a butter factory was established, flour mill, wineries and locally brewed cider and soft drinks were available.
The railway line from Sydney arrived at Albury in 1881 (see Transport-Rail below). A temporary wooden railway bridge joined the line to the Victorian network in 1883. New South Wales and Victoria had different track gauges until 1962, when the first train ran direct from Sydney to Melbourne. The two states could not initially agree which should be the transfer point so they had an expensive and attractive iron lattice bridge sent from Scotland which accommodated both gauges.

There was a school operating at Albury in 1848, catering for 13 private students. The following year the first National School opened on the corner of Dean and Kiewa Streets, with 73 students enrolled. In 1862 a new school was built in Olive Street on land which is now part of Albury Public School. The city&#x27;s first mayor, James Fallon, was an innovator of the Public School, funding a demonstration High School to be built on Kiewa Streets. Albury High School opened in Kiewa Street in 1927.

===20th-century city===
The &quot;Royal Commission on Sites for the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth&quot; report of 1903 recommended Albury (along with Tumut) as the preferred candidate for the national capital, though the proposal met staunch opposition from residents. At a public meeting, just one member of parliament voted in favour of Albury – Isaac Isaacs, member for Indi. The lack of support for other places ultimately led to the selection of Canberra as the preferred site.

In 1934, a Douglas DC-2 airliner of KLM (the &quot;Uiver&quot;), a competitor in the MacRobertson Trophy Air Race (also known as the London to Melbourne Air Race), made an emergency night landing at the town&#x27;s racecourse after becoming lost during severe thunderstorms. After signalling by Morse code A-L-B-U-R-Y to the lost aircrew by using the entire town&#x27;s public lighting system, the &quot;Uiver&quot; was guided in to land safely. The makeshift runway at the racecourse was illuminated by the headlights of cars belonging to local residents who had responded to a special news bulletin on ABC radio station 2CO. After refuelling the next day, many local volunteers helped pull the stranded aircraft out of the mud and the aircraft was able to take off and continue to Melbourne where it won first prize in the race&#x27;s handicap category and was second overall.

Albury and Wodonga played a military role in World War II with the establishment of ordnance bases at Bandiana and Bonegilla. Proclaimed a city in 1946, Albury played a role in the post-war immigration to Australia with the establishment nearby of Australia&#x27;s first migrant centre, the Bonegilla Migrant Reception and Training Centre in 1947.

Albury&#x27;s proximity to Wodonga has spurred several efforts to achieve some kind of municipal governmental union (see Albury-Wodonga). In 1973, Albury-Wodonga was selected as the primary focus of the Whitlam federal government&#x27;s scheme to redirect the uncontrolled growth of Australia&#x27;s large coastal cities (Sydney and Melbourne in particular) by encouraging decentralisation. Grand plans were made to turn Albury-Wodonga into a major inland city and large areas of the surrounding farmland were compulsorily purchased by the government. Some industries were enticed to move there, and a certain amount of population movement resulted. However, the current urban population is approximately 92,200.
==Population==

According to the 2021 census of Population, there were 53,677 people in the Albury part of the Albury – Wodonga Urban Centre.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 2.9% of the population.
* 81.2% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 1.9%, India 1.2%, New Zealand 1.0%, Philippines 0.6% and Bhutan 0.6%.
* 86.0% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Nepali 1.1%, Punjabi 0.6%, Mandarin 0.3%, Greek 0.3% and Hindi 0.3%.
* The most common responses for religion were No Religion 27.7%, Catholic 25.4% and Anglican 16.7%.

==Climate and geography==
Albury is situated above the river flats of the Murray River, in the foothills of the Great Dividing Range. At the city&#x27;s airport, Albury is above sea level.

===Climate===

Albury has a mild, temperate climate, with cool, damp winters and warm to hot, mostly dry, summers. Under the Köppen climate classification, Albury has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;), but would have tendencies of a Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) as well.

In high summer, the mean daily maximum temperature is with low humidity; however, this is subject to substantial daily variation. An average of 17 days with a maximum above occur in this summer period, with many cooler days. Mean mid winter maxima are with many cloudy days, and is likewise the wettest season. Albury gets approximately 20 days per year featuring minima of below freezing, though the cloud cover tends to limit frost. Sleet may occur during the winter months, but settling snowfalls are very rare, with the last significant snowfall in July 1966. The highest temperature recorded at Albury was 46.1 °C on 4 January 2020, and the lowest temperature was −4.0 °C recorded on 8 August 1994 (both at the Airport AWS station).

Albury&#x27;s mean annual rainfall is . Rainfall peaks distinctly in the winter months with a high mean of in July and August, comparing with the February low of . Albury has quite a high evaporation rate in summer, giving the environment a relatively arid appearance. The city enjoys a high amount of sunshine, getting around 108 days of clear skies annually (with the majority in summer and early autumn). The sunniest month is January, with 14.6 clear days (and 7.7 cloudy days), and the cloudiest month is July, with 17.5 cloudy days (and 3.9 clear days).
===Albury Airport AWS (1993–2022)===

The airport is a more sheltered site than the reservoir, generally attaining greater maximum temperatures but also lower minima. Rainfall is lower across the board.

==Governance==


Albury is the largest city in the Federal electorate of Farrer, whose current representative is Sussan Ley of the Liberal Party. The previous Federal MP was Tim Fischer, who was leader of the National Party and Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. In State politics, the Electoral district of Albury is currently represented by Justin Clancy, also of the Liberal Party. The member for Albury between 1932 and 1946, Alexander Mair, was the Premier of New South Wales from 1939 to 1941.

Local government is the responsibility of the Albury City Council, whose area of responsibility has gradually been enlarged to cover new housing estates on the city&#x27;s fringes. Amanda Duncan-Strelec became Albury&#x27;s first female Mayor in 1995, serving for one year. The current mayor of Albury is Kevin Mack.

Albury has a longstanding connection to conservative politics. Following the first convention in Canberra to form the Liberal Party of Australia, delegates, including Sir Robert Menzies, met for a second conference in Albury at Mate&#x27;s Department Store between 14 and 16 December 1944. The delegates agreed on the structure of the party organisation, adopted a provisional constitution and appointed a federal executive until one could be formally elected.

== City and suburbs ==
The city has a number of suburbs.

Central Albury comprises the central business district (CBD) and lies between the railway line, the Murray River and Monument Hill. Much commercial activity is concentrated here, with Dean Street forming the axis of the main shopping and office district. A cultural precinct is centred on QEII Square, which includes the Albury Library Museum, Murray Art Museum Albury (MAMA), Albury Entertainment Centre and Convention Centre, and the Murray Conservatorium. In the same block are the Post Office, Police Station and Courthouse, and St Matthew&#x27;s Anglican Church (which was rebuilt after being destroyed by fire in 1990). The Albury City Council offices are located on Kiewa Street.

Forrest Hill lies directly north west and covers the saddle between Monument Hill and Nail Can Hill. West over the ridge lies West Albury. West Albury is primarily a residential area, but it is home to the First World War Memorial (locally known as the Monument), Riverwood Retirement Village, Albury Wodonga Private Hospital (which lies on the corner of Pemberton Street and the Riverina Highway), and the Albury sewage treatment plant. All of West Albury was once wetland and bush. The only remnant of this is Horseshoe Lagoon to the south-west of the suburb, which has been declared a Wildlife Refuge by NSW Parks &amp; Wildlife and incorporated into the Wonga Wetlands. To the north-west of West Albury is Pemberton Park.

East Albury lies east of the railway line/freeway from the CBD and houses now cover the eastern hill alongside the Albury Base Hospital, while the flat land directly north of it is covered by parkland, housing and light industry, and a retail park including Harvey Norman and Spotlight franchises, as well as the city airport. The Mungabareena Reserve lies on the Murray south of the airport, and is considered an Aboriginal cultural site of some significance. Mungabareena means &quot;place of plenty talk&quot; in the Wiradjuri language.

South Albury is a mix of residential and industrial areas, with the floodplains south of the railway line and freeway still used for farming and grazing. Flood mitigation works in the 1990s have dramatically reduced the risk of flooding in this area.

North Albury was covered by orchards and vineyards in the first half of the 20th century, and a swamp existed where James Fallon High School now stands. After the World War II, housing development in the area increased and Waugh Road was extended from David Street to the &quot;Five Ways&quot; intersection at Union Road, which ascribes the border between North Albury and Lavington. The locality of &quot;Glenroy&quot; is adjacent to North Albury, west of the Bungambrawartha Creek, and housing was developed here in the 1970s, including a significant Housing Commission public housing estate.

Lavington is the largest suburb of Albury, and the only suburb which has its own postcode (2641, as opposed to 2640 for the balance of Albury). The suburb was originally named Black Range in the 1850s and 1860s, before being renamed Lavington in 1910. Originally within the boundaries of Hume Shire, it was absorbed into the City of Albury Local Government Area in the 1950s. Housing and commercial development has continued from that point until this day. Prior to 2007, the Hume Highway – passed north-east through the suburb, with Urana Road passing north-west through the suburb from the &quot;Five Ways&quot; road junction. In 2007, an internal bypass of the Hume Freeway was opened, with the former name of the Hume Highway section officially reverting to the commonly used &quot;Wagga Road&quot;. The suburb of Lavington also includes the localities of Springdale Heights, Hamilton Valley and Norris Park. Albury&#x27;s lawn cemetery and crematorium lies at the western end of Union Road.

Thurgoona, to the east of Lavington, was established as a new residential suburb by the Albury Wodonga Development Corporation in the 1970s. In the 1990s a new campus of Charles Sturt University was established here, as was an office of the Murray Darling Freshwater Research Centre. A major golf club (Thurgoona Country Club Resort) is also situated in this suburb.

Further outlying localities include Splitters Creek – a small residential/farming community to the west, Ettamogah (home of the Ettamogah Pub), Bowna and Table Top to the north, and Wirlinga and Lake Hume village to the east. Howlong (20 km west) and Jindera (16 km north) are the closest towns outside the Albury city area, and act as commuter dormitories as well as service centres for the local rural industries.

Albury&#x27;s houses and buildings are numbered using a special system introduced in 1920. The centre of the city, which is defined as the intersection of Dean and Olive Streets, is numbered 500, and all other houses are numbered depending on whether they are north, south, east or west of the centre.

===Lake Hume===

Lake Hume is situated on the Murray River upstream of Albury. The Hume Dam (colloquially termed the Weir locally) wall construction took 17 years, from 1919 to 1936. A hydro-electric power plant supplies 60 MW of power to the state grid. When full, the lake covers .

The lake was created for irrigation purposes and has caused significant changes to the flow patterns and ecology of the Murray River. Before the construction of the Hume Weir, flows in normal (non-drought) years were low in summer and autumn (though still significant overall), rising in winter due to seasonal rainfall and reaching a flood-peak in late spring due to snow-melt in the Murray and its tributaries&#x27; alpine headwaters. The flow is now effectively reversed, with low flows in winter and sustained, relatively high flows in late spring, summer and early autumn to meet irrigation demands, although the spring flood peak has been virtually eliminated. The water released from the base of the Hume Weir is unnaturally cold, at least colder than it naturally should be. This flow reversal, temperature depression, and removal of the spring flood peak, has led to the drying out and loss of many billabongs and has harmed the populations of native fish of the Murray River such as the iconic Murray Cod.

===Flora and fauna===
Several threatened species can be found in Albury, including the Sloane&#x27;s froglet, Regent Honeyeater, and Squirrel Glider (Petaurus norfolcensis).

==Transport==

===Road===

Situated on the Hume Highway, Albury is a major transit point for interstate commerce. In March 2007, Albury city centre was bypassed by a new section of the Hume Freeway. The city centre bypass includes the new Spirit of Progress Bridge over the Murray River, and cost $518 million, the most expensive road project built in rural Australia at that time.

Creation of the lake resulting from construction of the Hume Dam from 1915 onward necessitated a 30 km deviation of the Hume Highway. The Highway originally ran east out of Albury, along what is now the Riverina Highway, then turned north through Thurgoona via today’s Table Top Rd then Old Sydney Road, then crossed Bowna Creek to follow Plunkett Rd to Bowna. The deviation, opened in 1933, follows the first 9 km of the Wagga Road, then crossed the railway and ran to Bells Road before turning east then southeast to Bowna. Most of this route, although now duplicated, remains as part of the Hume Highway, other than the 2009 Yellow Creek deviation.

The other minor highways which connect to Albury are the Riverina Highway, which runs west through Berrigan to Deniliquin and east to Lake Hume; and the Olympic Highway which diverges north from the Hume north of Albury, and runs across the South Western Slopes via Wagga Wagga, Cootamundra and Young to terminate at the Mid-Western Highway at Cowra.

In 1888, the Smollett Street wrought iron arch bridge was constructed over Bungambrawatha Creek. Smollet Street was extended westward through the botanical gardens to give direct access from Albury railway station to Howlong Road by a straight street. The bridge is near the botanic gardens and the local swimming pool. The bridge is a rare example of a metal arch bridge in New South Wales, and is the oldest of only two such bridges in New South Wales, the other being the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

===Rail===

Albury railway station is on the main Sydney-Melbourne railway line. Originally, New South Wales and Victoria had different track gauges, which meant that all travellers in either direction had to change trains at Albury. To accommodate this, a very long railway platform was needed; the long covered platform is one of the longest in Australia. The broad gauge section of track between Seymour and Albury has now been converted to standard gauge; there is no longer a break-of-gauge at Albury station. The station is served by a three daily V/Line train services from Melbourne (terminating at Albury) and the NSW TrainLink Melbourne-Sydney XPT service, which runs twice daily in each direction.
In 1873, the broad gauge railway line from Melbourne reached the township of Belvoir/Wodonga. In 1881, the New South Wales standard gauge railway line reached Albury, with a railway bridge joining the two colonies in 1883. Albury became the stop over, where passengers on the Melbourne-Sydney journey changed trains until 1962, when a standard gauge track was opened between the two capitals. After World War II, in an attempt to overcome the difference in gauges and speed up traffic, a bogie exchange device lifted freight wagons and carriages allowing workers to refit rolling stock with different gauged wheel-sets.

The break of railway gauge at Albury was a major impediment to Australia&#x27;s war effort and infrastructure during both World Wars, as every soldier, every item of equipment, and all supplies had to be off-loaded from the broad gauge and reloaded onto a standard gauge railway wagon on the opposite side of the platform. In his book &quot;Tramps Abroad&quot;, writer Mark Twain in 1895 wrote of the break of gauge at Albury and changing trains: &quot;&quot;Now comes a singular thing, the oddest thing, the strangest thing, the most unaccountable marvel that Australia can show. At the frontier between NSW and Victoria our multitude of passengers were routed out of their snug beds by lantern light in the morning in the biting cold to change cars. Think of the paralysis of intellect that gave that idea birth, imagine the boulder it emerged from, on some petrified legislator&#x27;s shoulders.&quot;

During World War II military armouries and warehouses were established in the vicinity of Albury at Bonegilla, Wirlinga and Bandiana. Similar stores were also established at Tocumwal and Oaklands. The conversion of the broad gauge track to a second standard gauge track, between Seymour and Albury, was substantially completed in 2011. The railway station and its associated yards are listed on both the Australian National Heritage List and the New South Wales State Heritage Register.

===Air===

Albury Airport, owned and operated by the City of Albury, is the second busiest regional airport in New South Wales with around 280,000 passenger movements per year. The airport, east of the city centre, has scheduled daily flights to Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane through commercial carriers. The road leading from Albury Airport to the city was renamed Borella Road in 1979, in honour of Victoria Cross recipient Albert Chalmers Borella, who was buried at Albury.

===Public transport and cycling===
Local public transport is provided exclusively by private bus operators, Martin&#x27;s Albury and Dysons who run day time bus services. The overwhelming majority of local transport is by private car, however traffic is generally moderate. The opening of the Hume Freeway bypass on 4 March 2007, has greatly eased previous traffic congestion on the Lincoln Causeway, allowing vastly better flow between Albury and Wodonga.

There is a good network of bicycle paths in the city, including one to the outlying suburb of Thurgoona and across the state border to Wodonga. A new program has built many more bike tracks, including one from the riverside parks to Wonga Wetlands.

==Industry==

Albury serves as an administrative centre for the agricultural communities around the area, and the city is the home of the Norske Skog newsprint paper mill which processes the pine logs planted in the mountains to the east, a major processing centre of the Australian Taxation Office, and many other smaller secondary industries. Other large employers are: The Commercial Club Albury and Hume Bank.

One of Albury&#x27;s major employers was DSI Holdings. Originally the Kaitlers Road facility was opened as an expansion for Borg-Warner in 1971, manufacturing gearboxes for various manufacturers including Ford, Holden and even Maserati. At its peak in 1982 it employed 1251 people. The ownership of the plant changed several times – it was sold in 1987 to Nylex. It was sold again in 2002 to ION Ltd but the company collapsed in 2004 with debt to creditors of $550 million. Due to a failed deal with Holden the workforce was reduced to 750 people. Chinese car manufacturer Geely Group then purchased the bankrupt DSI company for $48 million in March 2009 and the plant then exported automatic transmissions to Geely, Ssangyong and Mahindra. In 2014 DSI Holdings closed the Lavington factory resulting in the loss of the remaining 142 jobs.

The Australian pizza chain Eagle Boys was founded in Albury but ceased operations in 2017 when it was purchased by Pizza Hut.

The Hume Power Station is a hydro-electric power station located at the Hume Dam on the Murray River, near Albury. The power station is operated by Eraring Energy and has two 29 MW turbines.

===Tourism===
The region surrounding Albury provides a variety of tourist attractions, including the wine region centred on Rutherglen, the historic goldfield towns of Beechworth and Yackandandah, boating, fishing and canoe hire on the many rivers and lakes, including Lake Hume, the forests and mountains of the Great Dividing Range and slightly further afield the snowfields Falls Creek and Mount Hotham.

Within the city of Albury itself, Monument Hill, at the western end of the CBD is the location of the city&#x27;s distinctive First World War Memorial and provides a good view of the city. Wonga Wetlands, west of the city and adjacent to the River Murray is a key feature of Albury&#x27;s use of treated wastewater and consists of a series of lagoons and billabongs. Wonga Wetlands boasts more than 150 species of birdlife and is home to the Aquatic Environment Education Centre.

The Hume and Hovell Walking Track, that begins in Yass and follows the route of explorers Hamilton Hume and William Hovell on their 1824 expedition to Port Phillip, ends at the Hovell Tree in South Albury.

===Education===

Albury is home to one of the campuses of Charles Sturt University. The original Albury campus was located in the northern part of the CBD between Kiewa and David streets. Charles Sturt University relocated to a new purpose-built campus at Thurgoona in 2009. CSU offers courses in Arts, Business, Education, Medicine and Science.

The Albury-Wodonga campus of La Trobe University is also a large and growing educational institution with several thousand undergraduates and postgraduates in its two colleges. Degrees in Business, Arts, Science, Bioscience, Nursing, and various Allied Health disciplines, are available. Riverina Institute of TAFE operates a campus in Albury. There is also a campus of the UNSW Rural Clinical School of Medicine adjacent to the Albury Base Hospital.

Albury is home to nine public primary schools (Albury Public School, Albury North Public School, Albury West Public School, Glenroy Public School, Hume Public School, Lavington Public School, Lavington East Public School, Springdale Heights Public School, and Thurgoona Public School) and three public high schools (Albury High School, James Fallon High School and Murray High School). Several non-government high schools operate in the area including Trinity Anglican College, Xavier High School, The Scots School Albury, Border Christian College, Aspect Riverina school, and St Paul&#x27;s College. The city is the base for NSW Department of Education South West Riverina regional office.

==Culture==

HotHouse Theatre is Albury&#x27;s only professional theatre company, previously known as the Murray River Performance Group which formed in 1979. It spawned The Flying Fruit Fly Circus in 1979, and these days conducts many productions through the HotHouse Theatre located on Gateway Island between Albury and Wodonga, though still in Victoria rather than New South Wales.

Albury is home to a large number of amateur theatre companies presenting productions ranging from plays in intimate settings to major musicals in the Albury Entertainment Centre and Shakespeare and other events in the Albury Botanic Gardens. The oldest theatre company in Albury is the Albury Wodonga Theatre Company and its associated youth theatre company BYTESized Productions often presenting shows in its small theatre in Olive St, South Albury . Other companies and organisations producing theatre in Albury Wodonga are Livid Productions, The Other Theatre Company, Revolution Theatre, and Centre Stage Event Company.

Jazz Albury Wodonga also regularly hosts national and international artists at the Jazz Basement which is located on Gateway Island.

Touring productions and major music acts often perform at the Albury Entertainment Centre. Regent Cinemas on Dean Street have operated since 1929.

Since 2007, the city has hosted the annual Albury City Short Story Award, curated by the Write Around the Murray Writers&#x27; Festival.

In 2015 Murray Art Museum Albury (MAMA) was opened, formerly known as Albury Regional Arts Centre. The art museum has 10 galleries with double the space of the former art centre. Canvas Eatery is also attached to MAMA, facing onto Queen Elizabeth II Square.

In 2003, a sister city relationship with Nanping in north western Fujian province, China, was formalised.

==Media==

===Print===
Albury serves as a regional media centre. A daily tabloid owned by Nine Entertainment, The &quot;Border Mail&quot;, is printed in, and has offices in, Wodonga.

===Television===
Albury has access to all major TV networks, with channels available including Seven, WIN Television (an affiliate of the Nine Network), Network 10, as well as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and the Special Broadcasting Service, more commonly known as SBS.

Of the three main commercial networks, Seven airs a half-hour local news bulletin at 6 pm each weeknight, produced from a newsroom in the city but broadcast from studios in Canberra.

Network 10 (formerly Southern Cross 10) airs short local news updates from its Hobart studios throughout the day (on weekdays). The flagship bulletin aired on Network 10 in Albury/Wodonga is 10 News First from Melbourne.

WIN Television broadcasts a half-hour state-wide regional WIN News bulletin each weeknight at 5:30 pm, produced from studios in Wollongong. Previously a local edition was produced by WIN until the closure of its Albury newsroom in June 2019.

On 5 May 2011, analogue television transmissions ceased in most areas of regional Victoria and some border regions including Albury–Wodonga. All local free-to-air television services are now broadcasting in digital transmission only. This was done as part of the Federal Government&#x27;s plan for Digital terrestrial television in Australia where all analogue transmission systems are gradually turned off and replaced with modern DVB-T transmission systems.

===Radio===

There are three commercial radio stations in Albury – 2AY on 1494 AM, Triple M The Border on 105.7 FM and Hit The Border on 104.9 FM. Hit 104.9 The Border&#x27;s south eastern network is programmed out of the Albury/Wodonga Hub, going to centres in the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia. Broadcasting out of the same building is Triple M 105.7 The Border, which is also networked to local stations around the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia.

Albury/Wodonga is one radio market, thus advertisements are directed to both sides of the border. The Albury/Wodonga market underwent significant change in 2005 when Macquarie Southern Cross Media bought 105.7 The River from RG Capital, and 2AY and Star FM from DMG Radio Australia. Due to cross-media ownership laws preventing the ownership of more than two stations in one market, Macquarie was required to sell one of these stations and in September 2005 sold 2AY to the Ace Radio network. 2AY takes much of its daytime and evening programming from 3AW in Melbourne. The ABC produces breakfast and morning radio programs through its local radio network, from the studios of ABC Goulburn Murray, 106.5 FM, located in Wodonga. Most of the rest its programming content is delivered from Melbourne. The ABC also has local transmitters for ABC Radio National, 990 AM; ABC News Radio, 100.9 FM; ABC Classic, 104.1 FM and Triple J, 103.3 FM

There is also a community radio station known as 2REM 107.3 FM. The Albury Wodonga Community Radio station broadcasts a large number of speciality programs including those for the retiree, racing enthusiast, ethnic and Aboriginal communities and a range of musical styles including underground and independent artists from 8:00 pm onwards. 2GHR 96.7 FM is another community radio station that plays classic hits. Oak 101.3 FM (from Wangaratta) can be heard clearly across the region. KIX 801 AM (on the narrowcast band) plays country music. Sky Radio is a sports and racing station which can be heard on 99.3 FM

In addition, the area is serviced by SBS Radio and Niche Radio, which provide national multicutural stations. SBS Radio 1 is available on 1701 AM, SBS Radio 2 is available on 89.5 FM, while Niche Radio broadcasts on 87.6 FM. 2APH 101.7 FM is a reading for the print handicapped station. TAFE FM is Wodonga&#x27;s broadcasting and training station on 88.4 that also serves the area. Albury-Wodonga Christian Broadcasters transmits as 98.5 The Light. Other religious stations include Faith FM which broadcasts on 88.0 and Vision Christian Radio that airs on 1611 AM. The dance music station Raw FM airs on 107.9

==Sport==

Despite being located in New South Wales, Albury is a stronghold of Australian rules. There are five Australian rules clubs in Albury, the Albury Football Club, the Lavington Panthers Football Club, the Murray Magpies Football Club, the North Albury Football Club, and the Thurgoona Football Club. Albury, Lavington Panthers and North Albury compete in the Ovens &amp; Murray Football League (OMFNL), while the Murray Magpies compete in the Hume Football League and Thurgoona compete in the Tallangatta &amp; District Football League. The OMFNL is one of the strongest regional leagues in the nation, with the Grand Final regularly drawing 15,000 spectators. Many players from Albury have moved on to play in the Australian Football League, including Haydn Bunton Senior, who won three Brownlow Medals and was an inaugural &quot;legend&quot; of the Australian Football Hall of Fame; Fitzroy 1936 Brownlow medallist Denis &quot;Dinny&quot; Ryan; and South Melbourne Brownlow medallist Fred Goldsmith.

Football is also a very popular code with more than 2,500 players registered from twelve local clubs (six from Albury) competing in the Albury Wodonga Football Association. Clubs have teams from U10s through to Senior Men and Women and play on Sundays with MiniRoos providing Football for ages 4–12 on Saturdays. Since 2016, Murray United Football Club, a team encompassing Albury, Wodonga and the wider region, has been competing in the National Premier Leagues Victoria, the highest level of Football in the area. On 9 February 2014, Melbourne City (then known as Melbourne Heart) triumphed 2–1 against Perth Glory in scorching conditions, where the temperature got as high as 41 °C, at the Lavington Sports Ground.
Albury has a strong rugby league community, with three senior teams based in the city, the Albury Thunder, Border Bears and CSU Mud Dogs. The Thunder compete in the strong, Riverina-based Group 9 Rugby League competition, while the Bears and Mud Dogs compete in the Goulburn Murray Rugby League run under the banner of the Victorian Rugby League. Albury Thunder Juniors is one of the largest junior rugby league clubs outside of metropolitan areas, offering rugby league and league tag to the Border&#x27;s young men and women from 5 years to 16 years. Albury has produced many great rugby league players, with the two most famous exports being former Canberra and Penrith flyer Adrian Purtell and Australian fullback Dylan Edwards.

The Albury-Wodonga Steamers are the local rugby union club, playing in the Southern Inland Rugby Union competition. The Steamers have produced several players for the Australian Rugby Union National Talent Squad.

Cricket is the most popular summer sport in the region, with the local Cricket Albury Wodonga competition administered by Country Cricket New South Wales. In the 1992 Cricket World Cup, the Lavington Sports Ground hosted Albury&#x27;s only international cricket match. It was a One Day International in which Zimbabwe defeated England in the biggest upset of the tournament. Albury also regularly hosts Big Bash League matches in both the pre-season and regular season, often involving the Sydney Thunder and Melbourne Stars.

The Albury Wodonga Bandits compete in the South East Australian Basketball League (SEABL) East Conference of the Australian Basketball Association (ABA), playing their home games at the Lauren Jackson Sports Centre (previously known as the Albury Sports Stadium). The Lady Bandits joined the women&#x27;s SEABL in 2006.

The Albury Gold Cup horse race is the major autumn event for the district. In 2005, it attracted a record crowd in excess of 18,600 racegoers.

Albury has lately become a stronghold of junior hockey, boasting one of the few synthetic fields in the area. The town also has the Albury Grass Tennis Courts. Supercars Championship team Brad Jones Racing is based in Albury, making it the only team in the championship to have its workshop in New South Wales.

Albury is the birthplace of controversial former tennis player Margaret Court, winner of 62 Women&#x27;s Grand Slam titles including eleven Australian titles, four Grand Slam singles titles played in one year (1970), four mixed doubles titles with Ken Fletcher in 1963 and many other titles around the world. WNBA MVP winner Lauren Jackson, NRL Player Adrian Purtell, and test cricketer Steve Rixon are among other champion sports people from the area.

==Notable crime==
Albury&#x27;s most notorious crime is also one of Australia&#x27;s most famous, the &#x27;Pyjama Girl Murder&#x27; in 1934. Other notable crimes include the murders of Bronwynne Richardson who was abducted on Smollett Street on 12 October 1973. Her body was found in Horseshoe Lagoon two days later. The case has never been solved despite a coronial inquest in 2011 which resulted in an arrest. In another case, on 23 March 1996, Kim Meredith was murdered in Macauley Street while walking from Sodens Hotel to the Termo Hotel. A memorial to Kim was later placed in Queen Elizabeth II Square by the citizens of Albury.

<text>Wodonga (pronounced ; ) is a city on the Victorian side of the border with New South Wales, north-east of Melbourne, Australia. It is part of the twin city of Albury-Wodonga and is located wholly within the boundaries of the City of Wodonga LGA and is separated from its twin city in New South Wales, Albury, by the Murray River. As of 2021 Wodonga and its suburbs have a population of 38,949 and combined with Albury, the two cities form the urban area Albury-Wodonga with a population of 97,793. There are multiple suburbs of Wodonga including Bandiana, Baranduda, Barnawartha, Bonegilla, Ebden, Huon Creek, Killara, Leneva and Staghorn.

Wodonga produces a gross domestic product of $2.5 billion per year on average.

==History==
Founded as a customs post with its twin city Albury on the other side of the Murray River, the town grew subsequent to the opening of the first bridge across the Murray River in 1860. Originally named Wodonga, its name was changed to Belvoir then later back to Wodonga.

The Post Office opened 1 June 1856 although known as Belvoir until 26 July 1869. 
It had previously been regarded as the smaller, less prosperous cousin of the two. Whilst still somewhat smaller than Albury, economic growth in both areas has ameliorated such distinctions.

The local Indigenous Waywurru name for the area, &quot;Wordonga&quot;, refers to an edible plant or nut found in lagoons.

==Government and politics==

Wodonga is in the federal Division of Indi. Independent MP Helen Haines has represented Indi since the 2019 Australian federal election. Indi was held by the Liberal-National Coalition from 1931 until 2013 when it was won by independent Cathy McGowan. When Helen Haines won the seat in 2019, succeeding Cathy McGowan, it was the first time in Australian history that one independent had succeeded another.

Wodonga is in the Victorian Electoral district of Benambra. Bill Tilley of the Liberal Party has represented the electoral district of Benambra since the 2006 Victorian state election. Benambra has been held by the Liberal-National Coalition since the 1932 Benambra by-election, and has never been held by the Labor Party. In the 2018 and 2022 Victorian elections, the seat became a close race between Bill Tilley and independent candidate Jacqui Hawkins, with Tilley narrowly retaining the seat.

Wodonga is the largest population centre in both Indi and Benambra.

The local government area covering Wodonga is City of Wodonga, and as of 2023 the current mayor is Ron Mildren (independent).

== Culture ==
Much of the arts and theatrical activity in the region is conducted in a cross-border fashion; for instance HotHouse Theatre is located almost equidistant from the Wodonga and Albury city centres.

Wodonga is served by the Apex Club of Wodonga, the Wodonga Lions Club and two Rotary Clubs – Belvoir Wodonga and Wodonga. Community Service is important to the Wodonga Community and activities such as the cities Australia Day Celebrations, Christmas Carols and the display of Santa&#x27;s throughout the City over the festive season would not be possible without community service clubs. Recently Apexian Dean Freeman was awarded National Apexian of the Year for community service efforts throughout the area and overseas.

===Popular culture===
Leonard Hubbard recorded the song &quot;Wodonga&quot; in 1924.

The World&#x27;s Biggest Rolling Pin (listed in the Guinness Book of World Records) is located in Wodonga, atop &quot;Henri&#x27;s Bakery&quot;.

==Sport==
Like much of country Victoria, Wodonga has a large and valued sporting culture. There are many sporting grounds in, and around, the area, and they are often frequented by the public in a social manner, when not being used for organised sport.

There are three Australian rules football clubs in Wodonga, the Wodonga Football Club, the Wodonga Raiders Football Club and the Wodonga Saints Football Club. Wodonga and Wodonga Raiders compete in the Ovens &amp; Murray Football League, while the Wodonga Saints compete in the Tallangatta &amp; District Football League. There are many other sporting clubs in the region. Brisbane Lions dual-premiership player Daniel Bradshaw and St Kilda forward Fraser Gehrig are originally from Wodonga.

Wodonga is also home to a number of cricket clubs which compete in the Cricket Albury Wodonga (CAW) competition. These include the Belvoir Eagles, Wodonga Bulldogs and Wodonga Raiders.

Cyclists are catered for by the Albury Wodonga Cycling Club. The Albury Wodonga Cycling Club holds club races most weekends, is part of the Riverina Interclub and hosts the annual John Woodman Memorial Wagga to Albury Cycling Classic.

Golfers play the course at SS&amp;A Wodonga on Parkers Road.

Wodonga has two rugby league clubs called the Wodonga Wombats and Bonegilla Gorillas that play in the Murray Cup. Former clubs include the Wodonga Storm and Wodonga Bears, both of whom were involved in Victorian Rugby League competitions.

Australian Socceroos Archie Thompson and Joshua Kennedy played for soccer team Twin City Wanderers as children. Wodonga Diamonds Football Club and Wodonga Heart Football Club are two other soccer clubs based in Wodonga. All three clubs compete in the Albury Wodonga Football Association, in which Wodonga Diamonds helped establish and is historically the most dominant club. In early 2014, a new club representing the region and playing its games in Wodonga was founded as Murray United F.C. Murray United&#x27;s senior structure has since ceased to exists, and now the club only fields junior teams throughout various tiers of Junior NPL.

Wodonga&#x27;s Tennis Centre is the largest inland tennis complex in Australia and incorporates not only tennis but also croquet and lawn bowls. The centre has 32 natural grass courts, 8 synthetic grass courts with lights for night use, and 10 plexicushion courts with lights for night use.

Wodonga has a horse racing club, the Wodonga &amp; District Turf Club, which schedules around seven race meetings a year including the Wodonga Cup meeting in November.

The Albury-Wodonga Motorcycle Club are located at Diamond Park on the southern part of Gateway Island, on the north side of the Murray River and organise motor cycle events. The motorcycle speedway track has hosted important events including the final of the 2024 Australian Speedway Championship.

Wodonga also has a BMX club, which is situated in a complex near the home ground of local AFL team, Wodonga Raiders.

Wodonga has a radio-controlled car site with both on-road and off-road tracks on the Lincoln Causeway, next to the speedway track.

==Climate==
The city gets around 125.1 clear days annually, largely in the summer and early autumn. Winters are rainy and cloudy, however, with breaks of sunny days during periods of high pressure systems. 
== Economy and infrastructure ==
===Industry===
Major secondary industries based in Wodonga include a logistics distributions hub (LOGIC), a large cattle market, a pet food factory (Mars Petcare), a can factory (Visy), a cardboard box factory (Opal) and (Visy Board), a hydraulic hose manufacturer (Parker Hannifin), an abattoir, a foundry (Bradken), a polypropylene film manufacturer (Taghleef Industries (formerly Shorko) a concrete pipe &amp; pole manufacturer (Rocla) and a transformer manufacturer (Wilson Transformer Company) as well as a variety of other smaller enterprises. It also serves as a central point for the delivery of government services to the surrounding region. Albury Wodonga is a major transport hub between Melbourne and Sydney, with over 20 transport companies in the area, (HumeTransport), (Dawsons Haulage), (Border Express) and (Obrian Transport Services) to name a few. All of which are responsible for the success and prosperity of the country. 

It houses the Australian corporate headquarters for Mars. Wodonga is the site of an Australian Army logistics base and a training centre for Army technical apprentices, the Army Logistic Training Centre, which is based at Latchford Barracks and Gaza Ridge Barracks. It is also the home of a campus of La Trobe University and Wodonga Institute of TAFE.

v2food is set to open a manufacturing plant, that will use locally-grown ingredients, in Wodonga in the second quarter of 2020. However, the plant was closed in 2023.

===Media===
====Print====
A daily tabloid owned by Australian Community Media, the &quot;Border Mail&quot;, is printed in Wodonga. The Border Mail has offices in both Albury and Wodonga.

====Television====
Wodonga is part of the Albury-Wodonga/Murray/North-East Victoria television market and has access to all major TV networks. Channels available include Channel 7 (formerly Prime7 and part of the Seven Network), WIN Television (part of the Nine Network), Southern Cross 10 (part of Network 10), as well as the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and the Special Broadcasting Service, more commonly known as SBS. Several of these networks also offer additional digital-only channels, including ABC Family, ABC Entertains, ABC News, SBS Viceland, 7two, 7mate, 7bravo, 7flix, 10 Bold Drama, 10 Peach Comedy, Nickelodeon, Sky News Regional, 9Gem, 9Go! and 9Life.

Two television news bulletins featuring local content are offered in Albury–Wodonga and the surrounding region. The Seven Network broadcasts its bulletin live at 6.00pm from studios in Canberra. WIN Television&#x27;s bulletin is produced in Ballarat but features Albury–Wodonga region based content, and airs on delay at 6.30pm. Southern Cross Austereo also provides short local news updates which are produced in Hobart, Tasmania, however, these do not feature significant local content from the Albury–Wodonga region.

====Radio====
There are three commercial radio stations broadcasting into Wodonga that are based over the border in Albury, namely 2AY, Triple M The Border and Hit104.9 The Border. Notably, Hit FM south eastern network is programmed out of the Albury/Wodonga Hub, going to centres around New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and into South Australia. Broadcast out of the same building as Triple M The Border, which is also networked to local stations around New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia.

Albury/Wodonga is one radio market, thus advertisements are directed to both sides of the border. The Albury/Wodonga market underwent significant change in 2005 when Macquarie Southern Cross Media bought 105.7 The River from RG Capital, and 2AY and Star FM from the DMG Radio Australia. Due to cross-media ownership laws preventing the ownership of more than two stations in one market, Macquarie was required to sell one of these stations and in September 2005 sold 2AY to the Ace Radio network. 2AY takes its night time programming from Nine Radio. Commercial radio stations from Wangaratta (3NE, Edge FM) can also be received in most parts of Wodonga.

The Australian Broadcasting Corporation produces breakfast and morning radio programs through its local radio network, from the studios of ABC Goulburn Murray located in Wodonga on 106.5FM. The rest of its content is delivered from Melbourne. The ABC also deliver Radio National on 990 AM, ABC Classic on 104.1 FM, ABC NewsRadio on 100.9 FM and Triple J on 103.3 FM.

There is also a community radio station known as 2REM 107.3 FM. The Albury-Wodonga Community Radio station plays a large number of speciality programs including those for the retiree, ethnic and aboriginal communities throughout the day and a range of musical styles including underground and independent artists from 8:00pm onwards.

In addition, the area is serviced by a Radio for the Print Handicapped station, 2APH, on 101.7 FM. Other stations include the Albury–Wodonga Christian Broadcasters&#x27; 98.5 The Light, and the dance formatted narrowcaster RawFM on 87.6 FM.

===Transport===

Wodonga railway station lies on the North East railway line. A new line was opened in late 2010 bypassing the Wodonga CBD, for which the town held a celebratory day for the last commercial passenger train to pass through the town centre. This line took the rail line out of the centre of town (and removed all of the level crossings), and a new station was built and the line was diverted north of the town to Albury.

Wodonga is on the junction of the Hume Highway (the main route from Melbourne to Sydney) and the Murray Valley Highway (which follows the southern bank of the Murray River).

Local public transport is provided by Dysons (which took over Mylon Motorways) who run buses on a number of routes both within Wodonga and to Albury. Bus services are generally quite infrequent and public transport use in Wodonga is very low. There are also long-distance bus services to the capitals.

There is a comprehensive network of bicycle paths in Wodonga, including one across the Lincoln Causeway to Albury.

Albury Airport, which provides scheduled commuter flights to Melbourne and Sydney, is a short drive from Wodonga.

== Education ==
From 2006, the three government high schools have merged to form a senior college for Years 10, 11 and 12, known as Wodonga Senior Secondary College, and a school for Years 7, 8 and 9, known as Wodonga Middle Years College, on two campuses; Felltimber and Huon Campus. The former 3 public high schools in Wodonga were Wodonga High School, Mitchell Secondary College and Wodonga West Secondary College. Wodonga High School celebrated its 50th birthday in 2005.

Private schools in Wodonga include: Catholic College Wodonga, Trinity Anglican College, Victory Lutheran College, Mount Carmel Christian School, St Augustines Primary School, St Monicas Primary School and St Francis of Assisi Primary School (formerly Frayne College).

Higher education is locally served by the Wodonga Institute of TAFE and La Trobe University. The regional Albury–Wodonga campus of La Trobe University was established in 1991 and provides courses in education, health sciences, biology, and business. The Albury-based campuses of Charles Stuart University, TAFE NSW and the University of New South Wales Rural Clinical School of Medicine are also closely located to Wodonga.

Wodonga is also home to the Flying Fruit Fly Circus School, the educational arm of The Flying Fruit Fly Circus, that provides educational services with an emphasis on the performing arts and contemporary circus training. In 2003 a devastating fire destroyed the school&#x27;s facilities at, then Wodonga High School, and the school relocated to Wodonga West Secondary College (now Wodonga Middle Years College Felltimber Campus).

<text>Queensland ( , commonly abbreviated as Qld) is a state in northeastern Australia, and is the second-largest and third-most populous of the Australian states. It is bordered by the Northern Territory, South Australia and New South Wales to the west, south-west and south, respectively. To the east, Queensland is bordered by the Coral Sea and the Pacific Ocean; to the state&#x27;s north is the Torres Strait, separating the Australian mainland from Papua New Guinea, and the Gulf of Carpentaria to the north-west. With an area of , Queensland is the world&#x27;s sixth-largest subnational entity; it is larger than all but 16 countries. Due to its size, Queensland&#x27;s geographical features and climates are diverse, and include tropical rainforests, rivers, coral reefs, mountain ranges and white sandy beaches in its tropical and sub-tropical coastal regions, as well as deserts and savanna in the semi-arid and desert climatic regions of its interior.

Queensland has a population of over 5.5 million, concentrated in South East Queensland, where nearly three in four reside. The capital and largest city in the state is Brisbane, Australia&#x27;s third-largest city and comprising fully half of the state’s population. Ten of Australia&#x27;s thirty largest cities are located in Queensland, the largest outside Brisbane being the Gold Coast, the Sunshine Coast, Townsville, Cairns, Ipswich, and Toowoomba. 24.2% of the state&#x27;s population were born overseas. The state has the highest inter-state net migration in Australia. 

Queensland was first inhabited by Aboriginal Australians, with the Torres Strait Islands inhabited by Torres Strait Islanders. Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon, the first European to land in Australia, explored the west coast of the Cape York Peninsula in 1606. In 1770, James Cook claimed the east coast of Australia for the Kingdom of Great Britain. In 1788, Arthur Phillip founded the colony of New South Wales, which included all of what is now Queensland. Queensland was explored in subsequent decades, and the Moreton Bay Penal Settlement was established at Brisbane in 1824 by John Oxley. During the Australian frontier wars of the 19th century, colonists killed tens of thousands of Aboriginal people in Queensland while consolidating their control over the territory.

On 6 June 1859 (now commemorated as Queensland Day), Queen Victoria signed the letters patent to establish the colony of Queensland, separating it from New South Wales and thereby establishing Queensland as a self-governing Crown colony with responsible government. A large part of colonial Queensland&#x27;s economy relied on blackbirded South Sea Islander slavery.

Queensland was among the six colonies which became the founding states of Australia with Federation on 1 January 1901. Since the Bjelke-Petersen era of the late 20th century, Queensland has received a high level of internal migration from the other states and territories of Australia and remains a popular destination for interstate migration.

Queensland has the third-largest economy among Australian states, with strengths in mining, agriculture, transportation, international education, insurance, and banking. Nicknamed the &quot;Sunshine State&quot; for its tropical and sub-tropical climates, Great Barrier Reef, and numerous beaches, tourism is also important to the state&#x27;s economy.

==History==
===Pre-European contact ===
Queensland was one of the largest regions of pre-colonial Aboriginal population in Australia. The Aboriginal occupation of Queensland is thought to predate 50,000 BC, and early migrants are believed to have arrived via boat or land bridge across Torres Strait. Through time, their descendants developed into more than 90 different language and cultural groups.

During the last ice age, Queensland&#x27;s landscape became more arid and largely desolate, making food and other supplies scarce. The people developed the world&#x27;s first seed-grinding technology. The end of the glacial period brought about a warming climate, making the land more hospitable. It brought high rainfall along the eastern coast, stimulating the growth of the state&#x27;s tropical rainforests.

The Torres Strait Islands is home to the Torres Strait Islander peoples. Torres Strait Islanders are ethnically and culturally distinct from mainland Aboriginal peoples. They have a long history of interaction with both Aboriginal peoples of what is now Australia and the peoples of New Guinea.

===European colonisation===
In February 1606, Dutch navigator Willem Janszoon landed near the site of what is now Weipa, on the western shore of Cape York. This was the first recorded landing of a European in Australia, and it also marked the first reported contact between Europeans and the Aboriginal people of Australia. The region was also explored by French and Spanish explorers (commanded by Louis Antoine de Bougainville and Luís Vaez de Torres, respectively) before the arrival of Lieutenant James Cook in 1770. Cook claimed the east coast under instruction from King George III of the Kingdom of Great Britain on 22 August 1770 at Possession Island, naming eastern Australia, including Queensland, &quot;New South Wales&quot;.

The Aboriginal population declined significantly after a smallpox epidemic during the late 18th century and massacres by the European settlers.

In 1823, John Oxley, a British explorer, sailed north from what is now Sydney to scout possible penal colony sites in Gladstone (then Port Curtis) and Moreton Bay. At Moreton Bay, he found the Brisbane River. He returned in 1824 and established a penal settlement at what is now Redcliffe. The settlement, initially known as Edenglassie, was then transferred to the current location of the Brisbane city centre. Edmund Lockyer discovered outcrops of coal along the banks of the upper Brisbane River in 1825. In 1839 transportation of convicts was ceased, culminating in the closure of the Brisbane penal settlement. In 1842 free settlement, which had already commenced, was officially permitted. In 1847, the Port of Maryborough was opened as a wool port. While most early immigrants came from New South Wales, the first free immigrant ship to arrive in Moreton Bay from Europe was the &quot;Artemisia&quot;, in 1848.

Earlier than this immigrant ship was the arrival of the Irish famine orphan girls to Queensland. Devised by the then British Secretary of State for the Colonies, The Earl Grey Scheme established a special emigration scheme which was designed to resettle destitute girls from the workhouses of Ireland during the Great Famine. The first ship, the &quot;Earl Grey&quot;, departed Ireland for a 124-day sail to Sydney. After controversy developed upon their arrival in Australia, a small group of 37 young orphans, sometimes referred to as The Belfast Girls or the Feisty Colleens, never set foot on Sydney soil, and instead sailed up to Brisbane (then Moreton Bay) on 21 October 1848 on board the &quot;Ann Mary&quot;. This scheme continued until 1852.

In 1857, Queensland&#x27;s first lighthouse was built at Cape Moreton.

=== Frontier wars and massacres ===

The frontier wars fought between European settlers and Aboriginal tribes in Queensland were the bloodiest and most brutal in colonial Australia. Many of these conflicts are now seen as acts of genocide.

The wars featured the most frequent massacres of First Nations people, the three deadliest massacres on white settlers, the most disreputable frontier police force, and the highest number of white victims to frontier violence on record in any Australian colony. Across at least 644 collisions at least 66,680 were killed — with Aboriginal fatalities alone comprising no less than 65,180. Of these deaths, around 24,000 Aboriginal men, women and children were killed by the Native Police between 1859 and 1897.

The military force of the Queensland Government in this war was the Native Police, who operated from 1849 to the 1920s. The Native Police was a body of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander troopers that operated under the command of white officers. The Native Police were often recruited forcefully from far-away communities. 

Conflict spread quickly with free settlement in 1838, with settlement rapidly expanding in a great rush to take up the surrounding land in the Darling Downs, Logan and Brisbane Valley and South Burnett onwards from 1840, in many cases leading to widespread fighting and heavy loss of life. The conflict later spread north to the Wide Bay and Burnett River and Hervey Bay region, and at one stage the settlement of Maryborough was virtually under siege.

The largest reasonably well-documented massacres in southeast Queensland were the Kilcoy and Whiteside poisonings, each of which was said to have taken up to 70 Aboriginal lives by use of a gift of flour laced with strychnine. At the Battle of One Tree Hill in September 1843, Multuggerah and his group of warriors ambushed one group of settlers, routing them and subsequently others in the skirmishes which followed, starting in retaliation for the Kilcoy poisoning.

Central Queensland was particularly hard hit during the 1860s and 1870s, several contemporary writers mention the Skull Hole, Bladensburg, or Mistake Creek massacre on Bladensburg Station near Winton, which in 1901 was said to have taken up to 200 Aboriginal lives. First Nations warriors killed 19 settlers during the Cullin-La-Ringo massacre on 17 October 1861. In the weeks afterwards, police, native police and civilians killed up to 370 members of the Gayiri Aboriginal people in response.

Frontier violence peaked on the northern mining frontier during the 1870s, most notably in Cook district and on the Palmer and Hodgkinson River goldfields, with heavy loss of Aboriginal lives and several well-known massacres. Raids conducted by the Kalkadoon held settlers out of Western Queensland for ten years until September 1884 when they attacked a force of settlers and native police at Battle Mountain near modern Cloncurry. The subsequent battle of Battle Mountain ended in disaster for the Kalkadoon, who suffered heavy losses. Fighting continued in North Queensland, however, with First Nations raiders attacking sheep and cattle while Native Police mounted heavy retaliatory massacres.

=== Slavery ===

Tens of thousands of South Sea Islanders were kidnapped from islands nearby to Australia and sold as slaves to work on the colony&#x27;s agricultural plantations through a process known as blackbirding.

This trade in what were then known as Kanakas was in operation from 1863 to 1908, a period of 45 years. Some 55,000 to 62,500 were brought to Australia, most being recruited or blackbirded from islands in Melanesia, such as the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu), the Solomon Islands and the islands around New Guinea.

The majority of those taken were male and around one quarter were under the age of sixteen. In total, approximately 15,000 South Sea Islander slaves died while working in Queensland, a figure which does not include those who died in transit or who were killed in the recruitment process. This represents a mortality rate of at least 30%, which is high considering most were only on three year contracts. It is also similar to the estimated 33% death rate of enslaved Africans in the first three years of being taken to America.

The trade was legally sanctioned and regulated under Queensland law, and prominent men such as Robert Towns made massive fortunes off of exploitation of slave labour, helping to establish some of the major cities in Queensland today. Towns&#x27; agent claimed that blackbirded labourers were &quot;savages who did not know the use of money&quot; and therefore did not deserve cash wages.

Following Federation in 1901, the White Australia policy came into effect, which saw most foreign workers in Australia deported under the &quot;Pacific Island Labourers Act 1901&quot;, which saw the Pacific Islander population of the state decrease rapidly.

===Independent governance===
A public meeting was held in 1851 to consider the proposed separation of Queensland from New South Wales. On 6 June 1859, Queen Victoria signed letters patent to form the separate colony of Queensland as a self-governing Crown colony with responsible government. Brisbane was selected as the capital city. On 10 December 1859, a proclamation was read by George Bowen, the first Governor of Queensland, formally establishing Queensland as a separate colony from New South Wales. On 22 May 1860 the first Queensland election was held and Robert Herbert, Bowen&#x27;s private secretary, was appointed as the first Premier of Queensland.

In 1865, the first rail line in the state opened between Ipswich and Grandchester. Queensland&#x27;s economy expanded rapidly in 1867 after James Nash discovered gold on the Mary River near the town of Gympie, sparking a gold rush and saving the Colony of Queensland from near economic collapse. While still significant, they were on a much smaller scale than the gold rushes of Victoria and New South Wales.

Immigration to Australia and Queensland, in particular, began in the 1850s to support the state economy. During the period from the 1860s until the early 20th century, many labourers, known at the time as Kanakas, were brought to Queensland from neighbouring Pacific Island nations to work in the state&#x27;s sugar cane fields. Some of these people had been kidnapped under a process known as blackbirding or press-ganging, and their employment conditions constituted an allegedly exploitative form of indentured labour. Italian immigrants entered the sugar cane industry from the 1890s.

During the 1890s, the six Australian colonies, including Queensland, held a series of referendums which culminated in the Federation of Australia on 1 January 1901. During this time, Queensland had a population of half a million people. Since then, Queensland has remained a federated state within Australia, and its population has significantly grown.

===20th century===
In 1905 women voted in state elections for the first time. The state&#x27;s first university, the University of Queensland, was established in Brisbane in 1909. In 1911, the first alternative treatments for polio were pioneered in Queensland and remain in use across the world today.

World War I had a major impact on Queensland. Over 58,000 Queenslanders fought in World War I and over 10,000 of them died.

Australia&#x27;s first major airline, Qantas (originally standing for &quot;Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services&quot;), was founded in Winton in 1920 to serve outback Queensland.

In 1922 Queensland abolished the Queensland Legislative Council, becoming the only Australian state with a unicameral parliament.

In 1935 cane toads were deliberately introduced to Queensland from Hawaii in an unsuccessful attempt to reduce the number of French&#x27;s cane and greyback cane beetles that were destroying the roots of sugar cane plants, which are integral to Queensland&#x27;s economy. The toads have remained an environmental pest since that time. In 1962, the first commercial production of oil in Queensland and Australia began at Moonie.

During World War II Brisbane became central to the Allied campaign when the AMP Building (now called MacArthur Central) was used as the South West Pacific headquarters for General Douglas MacArthur, chief of the Allied Pacific forces, until his headquarters were moved to Hollandia in August 1944. In 1942, during the war, Brisbane was the site of a violent clash between visiting US military personnel and Australian servicemen and civilians, which resulted in one death and hundreds of injuries. This incident became known colloquially as the Battle of Brisbane.

The end of World War II saw a wave of immigration from across Europe, with many more immigrants coming from southern and eastern Europe than in previous decades.

In the later decades of the 20th century, the humid subtropical climate—regulated by the availability of air conditioning—saw Queensland become a popular destination for migrants from interstate. Since that time, Queensland has continuously seen high levels of migration from the other states and territories of Australia.

In 1966, Lyndon B. Johnson became the first U.S. president to visit Queensland. During his visit, he met with Australia prime minister Harold Holt.

The end of the White Australia policy in 1973 saw the beginning of a wave of immigration from around the world, and most prominently from Asia, which continues to the present.

In 1981 the Great Barrier Reef off Queensland&#x27;s northeast coast, one of the world&#x27;s largest coral reef systems, was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

===21st century===
In 2003 Queensland adopted maroon as the state&#x27;s official colour. The announcement was made as a result of an informal tradition to use maroon to represent the state in association with sporting events.

After three decades of record population growth, Queensland was impacted by major floods between late 2010 and early 2011, causing extensive damage and disruption across the state.

In 2020 Queensland was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite a low number and abrupt decline in cases from April 2020 onward, social distancing requirements were implemented from March 2020 including the closure of the state borders.

==Geography==



With a total area of 1,729,742 square kilometres (715,309 square miles), Queensland is an expansive state with a highly diverse range of climates and geographical features. If Queensland were an independent nation, it would be the world&#x27;s 16th largest.

Queensland&#x27;s eastern coastline borders the Coral Sea, an arm of the Pacific Ocean. The state is bordered by the Torres Strait to the north, with Boigu Island off the coast of New Guinea representing the northern extreme of its territory. The triangular Cape York Peninsula, which points toward New Guinea, is the northernmost part of the state&#x27;s mainland. West of the peninsula&#x27;s tip, northern Queensland is bordered by the Gulf of Carpentaria. To the west, Queensland is bordered by the Northern Territory, at the 138th meridian east, and to the southwest by northeastern South Australia. The state&#x27;s southern border with New South Wales is constituted in the east by the watershed from Point Danger to the Dumaresq River, and the Dumaresq, Macintyre and Barwon rivers. The west of the southern border is defined by the 29th parallel south (including some minor historical encroachments) until it reaches South Australia.

Like much of eastern Australia, the Great Dividing Range runs roughly parallel with, and inland from, the coast, and areas west of the range are more arid than the humid coastal regions. The Great Barrier Reef, which is the world&#x27;s largest coral reef system, runs parallel to the state&#x27;s Coral Sea coast between the Torres Strait and K&#x27;gari (Fraser Island). Queensland&#x27;s coastline includes the world&#x27;s three largest sand islands: K&#x27;gari (Fraser Island), Moreton, and North Stradbroke.

The state contains six World Heritage-listed preservation areas: the Great Barrier Reef along the Coral Sea coast, K&#x27;gari (Fraser Island) on the Wide Bay–Burnett region&#x27;s coastline, the wet tropics in Far North Queensland including the Daintree Rainforest, Lamington National Park in South East Queensland, the Riversleigh fossil sites in North West Queensland, and the Gondwana Rainforests in South East Queensland.

The state is divided into several unofficial regions which are commonly used to refer to large areas of the state&#x27;s vast geography. These include:
* South East Queensland in the state&#x27;s coastal extreme south-eastern corner, an urban region which includes the state&#x27;s three largest cities: capital city Brisbane and popular coastal tourist destinations the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast. In some definitions, it also includes the city of Toowoomba. South East Queensland accounts for more than 70% of the state&#x27;s population.
* The Darling Downs in the state&#x27;s inland southeast, which consists of fertile agricultural (particularly cattle grazing) land and in some definitions includes the city of Toowoomba. The region also includes the mountainous Granite Belt, the state&#x27;s coldest region which occasionally experiences snow.
* Wide Bay–Burnett in the state&#x27;s coastal southeast, to the north of the South East Queensland region. It is rich in sugar cane farms and includes the cities of Bundaberg, Hervey Bay as well as K&#x27;gari (Fraser Island), the world&#x27;s largest sand island.
* Central Queensland on the state&#x27;s central coastline, which is dominated by cattle farmland and coal mining. It contains the Capricorn Coast and Whitsunday Islands tourist regions, as well as the cities of Rockhampton and Mackay.
* North Queensland on the state&#x27;s northern coastline, which is dominated by cattle farmland and mining and which includes the city of Townsville.
* Far North Queensland on the state&#x27;s extreme northern coastline along the Cape York Peninsula, which includes tropical rainforest, the state&#x27;s highest mountain, Mount Bartle Frere, the Atherton Tablelands pastoral region (dominated by sugar cane and tropical fruits), the most visited section of the Great Barrier Reef, as well as the city of Cairns.
* South West Queensland in the state&#x27;s inland south-west, which is a primarily agricultural region dominated by cattle farmland, and which includes the Channel Country region of intertwining rivulets.
* Central West Queensland in the state&#x27;s inland central-west, dominated by cattle farmland and which includes the city of Longreach.
* The Gulf Country (also known as North West Queensland), in the state&#x27;s inland north-west along the Gulf of Carpentaria, which is dominated by savanna and mining and includes the city of Mount Isa.

===Climate===
Because of its size, there is significant variation in climate across the state. There is ample rainfall along the coastline, with a monsoonal wet season in the tropical north, and humid sub-tropical conditions along the southern coastline. Low rainfall and hot humid summers are typical for the inland and west. Elevated areas in the south-eastern inland can experience temperatures well below freezing in mid-winter providing frost and, rarely, snowfall. The climate of the coastal regions is influenced by warm ocean waters, keeping the region free from extremes of temperature and providing moisture for rainfall.

There are six predominant climatic zones in Queensland, based on temperature and humidity:
* Hot humid summer, warm humid winter (far north and coastal): Cairns, Innisfail
* Hot humid summer, warm dry winter (north and coastal): Townsville, Mackay
* Hot humid summer, mild dry winter (coastal elevated areas and coastal south-east): Brisbane, Bundaberg, Rockhampton
* Hot dry summer, mild dry winter (central inland and north-west): Mt Isa, Emerald, Longreach
* Hot dry summer, cool dry winter (southern inland): Roma, Charleville, Goondiwindi
* Warm humid summer, cold dry winter (elevated south-eastern areas): Toowoomba, Warwick, Stanthorpe

The annual average climatic statistics for selected Queensland cities are shown below:

The coastal far north of the state is the wettest region in Australia, with Mount Bellenden Ker, south of Cairns, holding many Australian rainfall records with its annual average rainfall of over . Snow is rare in Queensland, although it does fall with some regularity along the far southern border with New South Wales, predominantly in the Stanthorpe district although on rare occasions further north and west. The most northerly snow ever recorded in Australia occurred near Mackay; however, this was exceptional.
Natural disasters are often a threat in Queensland: severe tropical cyclones can impact the central and northern coastlines and cause severe damage, with recent examples including Larry, Yasi, Ita and Debbie. Flooding from rain-bearing systems can also be severe and can occur anywhere in Queensland. One of the deadliest and most damaging floods in the history of the state occurred in early 2011. Severe springtime thunderstorms generally affect the south-east and inland of the state and can bring damaging winds, torrential rain, large hail and even tornadoes. The strongest tornado ever recorded in Australia occurred in Queensland near Bundaberg in November 1992. Droughts and bushfires can also occur; however, the latter are generally less severe than those that occur in southern states.

The highest official maximum temperature recorded in the state was at Birdsville Police Station on 24 December 1972. The lowest recorded minimum temperature is at Stanthorpe on 23 June 1961 and at The Hermitage (near Warwick) on 12 July 1965.

==Demographics==



In December 2021, Queensland had an estimated population of 5,265,043. Approximately half of the state&#x27;s population lives in Brisbane, and over 70% live in South East Queensland. Nonetheless, Queensland is the second most decentralised state in Australia after Tasmania. Since the 1980s, Queensland has consistently been the fastest-growing state in Australia, as it receives high levels of both international immigration and migration from interstate. There have however been short periods where Victoria and Western Australia have grown faster.

===Cities===
Ten of Australia&#x27;s thirty largest cities are located in Queensland. In 2019, the largest cities in the state by population of their Greater Capital City Statistical Area or Significant Urban Area (metropolitan areas) as defined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics were:
===Ancestry and immigration===

Early settlers during the 19th century were largely English, Irish, Scottish and German, while there was a wave of immigration from southern and eastern Europe (most notably Italy) in the decades following the second world war. In the 21st century, Asia (most notably China and India) has been the primary source of immigration.

At the 2016 census, the most commonly nominated ancestries were: 
The 2016 census showed that 28.9% of Queensland&#x27;s inhabitants were born overseas. Only 54.8% of inhabitants had both parents born in Australia, with the next most common birthplaces being New Zealand, England, India, Mainland China and South Africa. Brisbane has the 26th largest immigrant population among world metropolitan areas.

4% of the population, or 186,482 people, identified as Indigenous Australians (Aboriginal Australians and Torres Strait Islanders) in 2016.

=== Language ===
At the , 81.2% of inhabitants spoke only English at home, with the next most common languages being Mandarin (1.5%), Vietnamese (0.6%), Cantonese (0.5%), Spanish (0.4%) and Italian (0.4%).

At the , 80.5% of inhabitants spoke only English at home, with the next most common languages being Mandarin (1.6%), Vietnamese (0.6%), Punjabi (0.6%) and Spanish (0.6%).

===Religion===
At the , the most commonly cited religious affiliations were &#x27;No religion&#x27; (29.2%), Catholicism (21.7%) and Anglicanism (15.3%). In the 2016 Census the majority of Queenslanders were identified as Christian, most of which were of various Protestant denominations.

According to the , 45.7% of the population follows Christianity, and 41.2% identified as having No religion About 5% of people are affiliated with a non-Christian religion, mainly Buddhism (1.4%), Hinduism (1.3%) and Islam (1.2%). The 2021 census found that Protestants of various denominations outnumbered Catholics in Queensland.

===Education===
Queensland is home to numerous universities. The state&#x27;s oldest university, the University of Queensland, was established in 1909 and frequently ranks among the world&#x27;s top 50. Other major universities include Queensland University of Technology, Griffith University, the University of Southern Queensland, the University of the Sunshine Coast, James Cook University (which was the state&#x27;s first university outside of South East Queensland), Central Queensland University and Bond University (which was Australia&#x27;s first private university).

International education is an important industry, with 134,312 international students enrolled in the state in 2018, largely focused on Brisbane. Most of the state&#x27;s international students are from Asia.

At the primary and secondary levels, Queensland is home to numerous state and private schools.

Queensland has a public library system which is managed by the State Library of Queensland. Some university libraries are also open to the public.

==Economy==


In 2019, Queensland had a gross state product of A$357,044 million, the third-highest in the nation after New South Wales and Victoria. The construction of sea ports and railways along Queensland&#x27;s coast in the 19th century set up the foundations for the state&#x27;s export-oriented mining and agricultural sectors. Since the 1980s, a sizeable influx of interstate and overseas migrants, large amounts of federal government investment, increased mining of vast mineral deposits and an expanding aerospace sector have contributed to the state&#x27;s economic growth.

Primary industries include bananas, pineapples, peanuts, a wide variety of other tropical and temperate fruit and vegetables, grain crops, wineries, cattle raising, cotton, sugarcane, and wool. The mining industry includes bauxite, coal, silver, lead, zinc, gold and copper.

Secondary industries are mostly further processing of the above-mentioned primary produce. For example, bauxite is shipped by sea from Weipa and converted to alumina at Gladstone. There is also copper refining and the refining of sugar cane to sugar at a number of mills along the eastern coastline.

Major tertiary industries are retail, tourism, and international education. In 2018, there were 134,312 international students enrolled in the state, largely focused on Brisbane. Most of the state&#x27;s international students are from Asia.

Brisbane is categorised as a global city, and is among Asia-Pacific cities with largest GDPs. It has strengths in mining, banking, insurance, transportation, information technology, real estate and food. Some of the largest companies headquartered in Brisbane, all among Australia&#x27;s largest, include Suncorp Group, Virgin Australia, Aurizon, Bank of Queensland, Flight Centre, CUA, Sunsuper, QSuper, Domino&#x27;s Pizza Enterprises, Star Entertainment Group, ALS, TechnologyOne, NEXTDC, Super Retail Group, New Hope Coal, Jumbo Interactive, National Storage, Collins Foods and Boeing Australia.

===Tourism===
As a result of its varied landscapes, warm climate, and abundant natural environment, tourism is Queensland&#x27;s leading tertiary industry with millions of interstate and international visitors visiting the state each year. The industry generates $8.8 billion annually, accounting for 4.5% of Queensland&#x27;s Gross State Product. It has an annual export of $4.0 billion annually. The sector directly employs about 5.7% of Queensland citizens. Accommodation in Queensland caters for nearly 22% of the total expenditure, followed by restaurants/meals (15%), airfares (11%), fuel (11%) and shopping/gifts (11%).

The most visited tourist destinations of Queensland include Brisbane (including Moreton and South Stradbroke islands and the Gold Coast) as well as the Sunshine Coast, the Great Barrier Reef, Cairns, Port Douglas, the Daintree Rainforest, K&#x27;gari and the Whitsunday Islands.

Brisbane is the third most popular destination in Australia following Sydney and Melbourne. Major attractions in its metropolitan area include South Bank Parklands, the Queensland Cultural Centre (including the Queensland Museum, Queensland Art Gallery, Gallery of Modern Art, Queensland Performing Arts Centre and State Library of Queensland), City Hall, the Story Bridge, the Howard Smith Wharves, ANZAC Square, St John&#x27;s Cathedral, Fortitude Valley (including James Street and Chinatown), West End, the Teneriffe woolstores precinct, the Brisbane River and its Riverwalk network, the City Botanic Gardens, Roma Street Parkland, New Farm Park (including the Brisbane Powerhouse), the Kangaroo Point Cliffs and park, the Lone Pine Koala Sanctuary, the Mount Coot-tha Reserve (including Mount Coot-tha Lookout and Mount Coot-tha Botanic Gardens), the D&#x27;Aguilar Range and National Park, as well as Moreton Bay (including Moreton, North Stradbroke and Bribie islands, and coastal suburbs such as Shorncliffe, Wynnum and those on the Redcliffe Peninsula).

The Gold Coast is home to numerous popular surf beaches such as those at Surfers Paradise and Burleigh Heads. It also includes the largest concentration of amusement parks in Australia, including Dreamworld, Movie World, Sea World, Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild and WhiteWater World, as well as the Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary. The Gold Coast&#x27;s hinterland includes Lamington National Park in the McPherson Range.

The Sunshine Coast includes popular surfing and beach destinations including Noosa Heads and Mooloolaba. It is also home to UnderWater World and Steve Irwin&#x27;s Australia Zoo. Its hinterland includes the Glass House Mountains National Park.

Cairns is renowned as the gateway to the Great Barrier Reef, Far North Queensland (including Port Douglas) and the Daintree Rainforest. The Whitsunday Islands off the coast of North Queensland are a popular tourist destinations for their resort facilities and access to the Great Barrier Reef.

==Politics and government==

One of the six founding states of Australia, Queensland has been a federated state subject to the Australian Constitution since 1 January 1901. It may legislate on all matters not ceded in the Australian Constitution to the federal government. It is a parliamentary constitutional monarchy. The Constitution of Queensland sets out the operation of the state&#x27;s government. The state&#x27;s constitution contains several entrenched provisions which cannot be changed in the absence of a referendum. There is also a statutory charter of rights, the &quot;Queensland Human Rights Act 2019&quot;. Queensland&#x27;s system of government is influenced by the Westminster system and Australia&#x27;s federal system of government.

The government power can be divided into three groups:
* Legislature: the unicameral Parliament of Queensland, comprising the Legislative Assembly and the Monarch (represented by the Governor);
* Executive: the Queensland Government, which consists of the Executive Council of Queensland, which formalises decisions of the Cabinet of Queensland, which is composed of the Premier and other ministers of state appointed by the Governor on the advice of the premier;
* Judiciary: the Supreme Court and other state courts, whose judges are appointed by the Governor on the advice of Parliament.

Executive authority is nominally vested in the Governor of Queensland (currently Jeannette Young) who represents and is appointed by the Monarch (currently Charles III) on the advice of the Premier of Queensland. The Premier, who is the state&#x27;s Head of government, along with the Cabinet of Queensland (whose decisions are formalised by the Executive Council), exercise executive authority in practice. The Premier is appointed by the Governor and must have support of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. The Premier is in practice a leading member of the Legislative Assembly and parliamentary leader of his or her political party, or coalition of parties, and members of the Cabinet will be drawn from the same party or coalition. The current Premier and Deputy Premier are David Crisafulli and Jarrod Bleijie of the Liberal National Party respectively. Government House at Paddington in Brisbane is the seat of the Governor, having replaced Old Government House at Gardens Point in Brisbane&#x27;s CBD in the early 20th century. The executive branch is simply referred to as the Queensland Government.

Legislative authority is exercised by the Queensland Parliament which uniquely for Australian states is unicameral, containing only one house, the Legislative Assembly. The Parliament was bicameral until 1922 when the Legislative Council was abolished by the Labor &quot;suicide squad&quot;, so called because they were appointed for the purpose of voting to abolish their own offices. Bills receive royal assent from the Governor before being passed into law. The Parliament&#x27;s seat is at Parliament House at Gardens Point in Brisbane&#x27;s CBD. Members of the Legislative Assembly represent 93 electoral districts. Elections in Queensland are held at the end of each fixed four-year parliamentary term and are determined by full preferential voting.

The state&#x27;s judiciary consists of the Supreme Court of Queensland and the District Court of Queensland, established by the Queensland Constitution, as well as the Magistrates Court of Queensland and other courts and tribunals established by legislation. Cases may be appealed to the High Court of Australia. As with all Australian states and territories, Queensland has a common law legal system. The Supreme and District courts are headquartered at the Queen Elizabeth II Courts of Law in Brisbane&#x27;s CBD.

The state&#x27;s politics are traditionally regarded as being conservative relative to other states. Historically, the lack of an upper house, the &quot;Bjelkemander&quot; (a malapportion favouring rural electoral districts) has meant that Queensland had a long tradition of domination by strong-willed, populist premiers, often accused of authoritarian tendencies, holding office for long periods. This tendency was exemplified by the government of the state&#x27;s longest-serving Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen.

===Local government===
Local government is the mechanism by which local government areas can manage their own affairs to the extent permitted by the Local Government Act 2009. Queensland is divided into 77 local government areas, which are created by the state government under the legislation. Each local government area has a council responsible for providing a range of local services and utilities. Local councils derive their income from both rates and charges on resident ratepayers, and grants and subsidies from the state and federal governments.

===Federal representation===
In the federal Parliament, Queensland accounts for 30 of the 151 electoral divisions in the House of Representatives (based on population size) and 12 of the 76 seats in the Senate (based on equality between the states).

The current partisan makeup of Queensland&#x27;s House of Representatives delegation is 21 Liberal National, 5 Labor, 3 Australian Greens, and 1 Katter&#x27;s Australian Party.

The current partisan makeup of Queensland&#x27;s Senate delegation is 5 Liberal National, 3 Labor, 2 One Nation, and 2 Green.

==Culture==
Queensland is home to major art galleries including the Queensland Art Gallery and the Queensland Gallery of Modern Art as well as cultural institutions such as the Queensland Ballet, Opera Queensland, Queensland Theatre Company, and Queensland Symphony Orchestra, all based at the Queensland Cultural Centre in Brisbane. The state is the origin of musicians such as the Bee Gees, the Go-Betweens, the Veronicas, the Saints, Savage Garden, and Sheppard as well as writers such as David Malouf, Nick Earls and Li Cunxin.

Major annual cultural events include the Royal Queensland Exhibition (known locally as the Ekka), an agricultural exhibition held each August at the Brisbane Showgrounds as well as the Brisbane Festival, which includes one of the nation&#x27;s largest annual fireworks displays called &#x27;Riverfire&#x27;, and which is held each September.

===Sport===

The state of Queensland is represented in all of Australia&#x27;s national sporting competitions and it is also host to a number of domestic and international sporting events. The most popular winter and summer team sports are rugby league and cricket, respectively.

In the National Rugby League, the Brisbane Broncos, North Queensland Cowboys, The Dolphins and Gold Coast Titans are based in the state. Rugby league&#x27;s annual State of Origin series is a major event in the Queensland sporting calendar, with the Queensland Maroons representing the state.

In cricket, the Queensland Bulls represent the state in the Sheffield Shield and the Ryobi One Day Cup, while the Brisbane Heat compete in the Big Bash League.

Queensland is also home to the Brisbane Lions and the Gold Coast Suns in the Australian Football League (Australian rules football), and the Brisbane Roar FC in the A-League (soccer). In netball, the Queensland Firebirds went undefeated in the 2011 season as they went on to win the Grand Final. Other sports teams are the Brisbane Bullets and the Cairns Taipans, who compete in the National Basketball League.

The state is represented by the Queensland Reds in the Super Rugby (rugby union).

Swimming is also a popular sport in Queensland, with many Australian team members and international medalists hailing from the state.

Brisbane will host the 2032 Summer Olympics, marking the third time Australia hosted the Olympic Games following Melbourne 1956 and Sydney 2000. Major recurring sporting events hosted in Queensland include: the Gold Coast 600 (motorsport; since 1994), the Gold Coast Marathon (athletics; since 1979), the NRL All Stars Game (rugby league; since 2010), the Townsville 400 (motorsport; since 2009), the Quicksilver Pro and Roxy Pro (surfing) and Australian PGA Championship (golf; since 2000).

===Symbols and emblems===

The official state emblems of Queensland are prescribed in the Emblems of Queensland Act 2005.

Queen Victoria granted the Queensland Coat of Arms to the Colony of Queensland in 1893, making it the oldest State Arms in Australia. It depicts Queensland&#x27;s primary industries in the 19th century with a sheaf of wheat, the heads of a bull and a ram, and a column of gold rising from a heap of quartz. Two stalks of sugar cane which surround the state badge at the top, and below is Queensland&#x27;s state motto, &quot;Audax at Fidelis&quot;, which means &quot;Bold but Faithful&quot;. In 1977, Queen Elizabeth II granted the supporting animals, the brolga and the red deer.

In November 2003 maroon was officially named Queensland&#x27;s state colour, after many years of association with Queensland sporting teams.

The koala was officially named the animal or faunal, emblem of Queensland in 1971 after a newspaper poll showed strong public support. The Queensland Government introduced the poll due to a proposal by state tourism ministers for all states to adopt a faunal emblem. In January 1986, the brolga was announced as the official bird emblem of Queensland, after many years on the Coat of Arms.

The Cooktown orchid became known as Queensland&#x27;s floral emblem in 1959, during celebrations to mark the state&#x27;s centenary, and the Barrier Reef Anemone Fish was officially named as Queensland&#x27;s aquatic emblem in March 2005.

The sapphire was named the official state gem for Queensland in August 1985.

==Infrastructure==

===Transport===

Queensland is served by several National Highways and, particularly in South East Queensland, a network of freeways such as the M1. The Department of Transport &amp; Main Roads oversees the development and operation of main roads and public transport, including taxis and local aviation.

Principal rail services are provided by Queensland Rail, predominantly between the major centres east of the Great Dividing Range. Freight rail services in Queensland have been provided mostly by Aurizon and Pacific National, with interstate intermodal services provided by Pacific National and SCT Logistics. Major seaports include the Port of Brisbane, Australia&#x27;s third busiest by value of goods, as well as those at Gladstone, Townsville, and Bundaberg. There are large coal export facilities at Hay Point, Gladstone, and Abbot Point. Major sugar export facilities are located at Lucinda and Mackay.

Brisbane Airport is the main international and domestic gateway serving the state, and is the third busiest in Australia.

<text>In physics, specifically statistical mechanics, an ensemble (also statistical ensemble) is an idealization consisting of a large number of virtual copies (sometimes infinitely many) of a system, considered all at once, each of which represents a possible state that the real system might be in. In other words, a statistical ensemble is a set of systems of particles used in statistical mechanics to describe a single
system. The concept of an ensemble was introduced by J. Willard Gibbs in 1902.

A thermodynamic ensemble is a specific variety of statistical ensemble that, among other properties, is in statistical equilibrium (defined below), and is used to derive the properties of thermodynamic systems from the laws of classical or quantum mechanics.

== Physical considerations ==

The ensemble formalises the notion that an experimenter repeating an experiment again and again under the same macroscopic conditions, but unable to control the microscopic details, may expect to observe a range of different outcomes.

The notional size of ensembles in thermodynamics, statistical mechanics and quantum statistical mechanics can be very large, including every possible microscopic state the system could be in, consistent with its observed macroscopic properties. For many important physical cases, it is possible to calculate averages directly over the whole of the thermodynamic ensemble, to obtain explicit formulas for many of the thermodynamic quantities of interest, often in terms of the appropriate partition function.

The concept of an equilibrium or stationary ensemble is crucial to many applications of statistical ensembles. Although a mechanical system certainly evolves over time, the ensemble does not necessarily have to evolve. In fact, the ensemble will not evolve if it contains all past and future phases of the system. Such a statistical ensemble, one that does not change over time, is called &quot;stationary&quot; and can be said to be in &quot;statistical equilibrium&quot;.

=== Terminology ===

* The word &quot;ensemble&quot; is also used for a smaller set of possibilities sampled from the full set of possible states. For example, a collection of walkers in a Markov chain Monte Carlo iteration is called an ensemble in some of the literature.
* The term &quot;ensemble&quot; is often used in physics and the physics-influenced literature. In probability theory, the term probability space is more prevalent.

== Main types ==

The study of thermodynamics is concerned with systems that appear to human perception to be &quot;static&quot; (despite the motion of their internal parts), and which can be described simply by a set of macroscopically observable variables. These systems can be described by statistical ensembles that depend on a few observable parameters, and which are in statistical equilibrium. Gibbs noted that different macroscopic constraints lead to different types of ensembles, with particular statistical characteristics.
&quot;&quot;We may imagine a great number of systems of the same nature, but differing in the configurations and velocities which they have at a given instant, and differing in not merely infinitesimally, but it may be so as to embrace every conceivable combination of configuration and velocities...&quot; J. W. Gibbs&quot; (1903)
Three important thermodynamic ensembles were defined by Gibbs:
* &quot;Microcanonical ensemble&quot; (or &quot;NVE ensemble&quot;) —a statistical ensemble where the total energy of the system and the number of particles in the system are each fixed to particular values; each of the members of the ensemble are required to have the same total energy and particle number. The system must remain totally isolated (unable to exchange energy or particles with its environment) in order to stay in statistical equilibrium.
* &quot;Canonical ensemble&quot; (or &quot;NVT ensemble&quot;)—a statistical ensemble where the energy is not known exactly but the number of particles is fixed. In place of the energy, the temperature is specified. The canonical ensemble is appropriate for describing a closed system which is in, or has been in, weak thermal contact with a heat bath. In order to be in statistical equilibrium, the system must remain totally closed (unable to exchange particles with its environment) and may come into weak thermal contact with other systems that are described by ensembles with the same temperature.
* &quot;Grand canonical ensemble&quot; (or &quot;μVT ensemble&quot;)—a statistical ensemble where neither the energy nor particle number are fixed. In their place, the temperature and chemical potential are specified. The grand canonical ensemble is appropriate for describing an open system: one which is in, or has been in, weak contact with a reservoir (thermal contact, chemical contact, radiative contact, electrical contact, etc.). The ensemble remains in statistical equilibrium if the system comes into weak contact with other systems that are described by ensembles with the same temperature and chemical potential.

The calculations that can be made using each of these ensembles are explored further in their respective articles.
Other thermodynamic ensembles can be also defined, corresponding to different physical requirements, for which analogous formulae can often similarly be derived.
For example, in the reaction ensemble, particle number fluctuations are only allowed to occur according to the stoichiometry of the chemical reactions which are present in the system. 

=== Equivalence ===

In thermodynamic limit all ensembles should produce identical observables due to Legendre transforms, deviations to this rule occurs under conditions that state-variables are non-convex, such as small molecular measurements. 

== Representations ==

The precise mathematical expression for a statistical ensemble has a distinct form depending on the type of mechanics under consideration (quantum or classical). In the classical case, the ensemble is a probability distribution over the microstates. In quantum mechanics, this notion, due to von Neumann, is a way of assigning a probability distribution over the results of each complete set of commuting observables. 
In classical mechanics, the ensemble is instead written as a probability distribution in phase space; the microstates are the result of partitioning phase space into equal-sized units, although the size of these units can be chosen somewhat arbitrarily.

=== Requirements for representations ===

Putting aside for the moment the question of how statistical ensembles are generated operationally, we should be able to perform the following two operations on ensembles &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; of the same system:
* Test whether &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; are statistically equivalent.
* If &quot;p&quot; is a real number such that , then produce a new ensemble by probabilistic sampling from &quot;A&quot; with probability &quot;p&quot; and from &quot;B&quot; with probability .

Under certain conditions, therefore, equivalence classes of statistical ensembles have the structure of a convex set.

=== Quantum mechanical ===

A statistical ensemble in quantum mechanics (also known as a mixed state) is most often represented by a density matrix, denoted by formula_1. The density matrix provides a fully general tool that can incorporate both quantum uncertainties (present even if the state of the system were completely known) and classical uncertainties (due to a lack of knowledge) in a unified manner. Any physical observable in quantum mechanics can be written as an operator, formula_2. The expectation value of this operator on the statistical ensemble formula_3 is given by the following trace:
: formula_4
This can be used to evaluate averages (operator formula_2), variances (using operator formula_6), covariances (using operator formula_7), etc. The density matrix must always have a trace of 1: formula_8 (this essentially is the condition that the probabilities must add up to one).

In general, the ensemble evolves over time according to the von Neumann equation.

Equilibrium ensembles (those that do not evolve over time, formula_9) can be written solely as a function of conserved variables. For example, the microcanonical ensemble and canonical ensemble are strictly functions of the total energy, which is measured by the total energy operator formula_10 (Hamiltonian). The grand canonical ensemble is additionally a function of the particle number, measured by the total particle number operator formula_11. Such equilibrium ensembles are a diagonal matrix in the orthogonal basis of states that simultaneously diagonalize each conserved variable. In bra–ket notation, the density matrix is
: formula_12
where the , indexed by , are the elements of a complete and orthogonal basis. (Note that in other bases, the density matrix is not necessarily diagonal.)

=== Classical mechanical ===

In classical mechanics, an ensemble is represented by a probability density function defined over the system&#x27;s phase space. While an individual system evolves according to Hamilton&#x27;s equations, the density function (the ensemble) evolves over time according to Liouville&#x27;s equation.

In a mechanical system with a defined number of parts, the phase space has generalized coordinates called , and associated canonical momenta called . The ensemble is then represented by a joint probability density function .

If the number of parts in the system is allowed to vary among the systems in the ensemble (as in a grand ensemble where the number of particles is a random quantity), then it is a probability distribution over an extended phase space that includes further variables such as particle numbers (first kind of particle), (second kind of particle), and so on up to (the last kind of particle; is how many different kinds of particles there are). The ensemble is then represented by a joint probability density function . The number of coordinates varies with the numbers of particles.

Any mechanical quantity can be written as a function of the system&#x27;s phase. The expectation value of any such quantity is given by an integral over the entire phase space of this quantity weighted by :
: formula_13
The condition of probability normalization applies, requiring
: formula_14

Phase space is a continuous space containing an infinite number of distinct physical states within any small region. In order to connect the probability &quot;density&quot; in phase space to a probability &quot;distribution&quot; over microstates, it is necessary to somehow partition the phase space into blocks that are distributed representing the different states of the system in a fair way. It turns out that the correct way to do this simply results in equal-sized blocks of canonical phase space, and so a microstate in classical mechanics is an extended region in the phase space of canonical coordinates that has a particular volume. In particular, the probability density function in phase space, , is related to the probability distribution over microstates, by a factor
: formula_15
where
* is an arbitrary but predetermined constant with the units of , setting the extent of the microstate and providing correct dimensions to .
* is an overcounting correction factor (see below), generally dependent on the number of particles and similar concerns.
Since can be chosen arbitrarily, the notional size of a microstate is also arbitrary. Still, the value of influences the offsets of quantities such as entropy and chemical potential, and so it is important to be consistent with the value of when comparing different systems.

==== Correcting overcounting in phase space ====

Typically, the phase space contains duplicates of the same physical state in multiple distinct locations. This is a consequence of the way that a physical state is encoded into mathematical coordinates; the simplest choice of coordinate system often allows a state to be encoded in multiple ways. An example of this is a gas of identical particles whose state is written in terms of the particles&#x27; individual positions and momenta: when two particles are exchanged, the resulting point in phase space is different, and yet it corresponds to an identical physical state of the system. It is important in statistical mechanics (a theory about physical states) to recognize that the phase space is just a mathematical construction, and to not naively overcount actual physical states when integrating over phase space. Overcounting can cause serious problems:
* Dependence of derived quantities (such as entropy and chemical potential) on the choice of coordinate system, since one coordinate system might show more or less overcounting than another.
* Erroneous conclusions that are inconsistent with physical experience, as in the mixing paradox.
* Foundational issues in defining the chemical potential and the grand canonical ensemble.
It is in general difficult to find a coordinate system that uniquely encodes each physical state. As a result, it is usually necessary to use a coordinate system with multiple copies of each state, and then to recognize and remove the overcounting.

A crude way to remove the overcounting would be to manually define a subregion of phase space that includes each physical state only once and then exclude all other parts of phase space. In a gas, for example, one could include only those phases where the particles&#x27; coordinates are sorted in ascending order. While this would solve the problem, the resulting integral over phase space would be tedious to perform due to its unusual boundary shape. (In this case, the factor introduced above would be set to , and the integral would be restricted to the selected subregion of phase space.)

A simpler way to correct the overcounting is to integrate over all of phase space but to reduce the weight of each phase in order to exactly compensate the overcounting. This is accomplished by the factor introduced above, which is a whole number that represents how many ways a physical state can be represented in phase space. Its value does not vary with the continuous canonical coordinates, so overcounting can be corrected simply by integrating over the full range of canonical coordinates, then dividing the result by the overcounting factor. However, does vary strongly with discrete variables such as numbers of particles, and so it must be applied before summing over particle numbers.

As mentioned above, the classic example of this overcounting is for a fluid system containing various kinds of particles, where any two particles of the same kind are indistinguishable and exchangeable. When the state is written in terms of the particles&#x27; individual positions and momenta, then the overcounting related to the exchange of identical particles is corrected by using
:formula_16
This is known as &quot;correct Boltzmann counting&quot;.

== Ensembles in statistics ==

The formulation of statistical ensembles used in physics has now been widely adopted in other fields, in part because it has been recognized that the canonical ensemble or Gibbs measure serves to maximize the entropy of a system, subject to a set of constraints: this is the principle of maximum entropy. This principle has now been widely applied to problems in linguistics, robotics, and the like.

In addition, statistical ensembles in physics are often built on a principle of locality: that all interactions are only between neighboring atoms or nearby molecules. Thus, for example, lattice models, such as the Ising model, model ferromagnetic materials by means of nearest-neighbor interactions between spins. The statistical formulation of the principle of locality is now seen to be a form of the Markov property in the broad sense; nearest neighbors are now Markov blankets. Thus, the general notion of a statistical ensemble with nearest-neighbor interactions leads to Markov random fields, which again find broad applicability; for example in Hopfield networks.

== Ensemble average ==
In statistical mechanics, the ensemble average is defined as the mean of a quantity that is a function of the microstate of a system, according to the distribution of the system on its micro-states in this ensemble.

Since the ensemble average is dependent on the ensemble chosen, its mathematical expression varies from ensemble to ensemble. However, the mean obtained for a given physical quantity does not depend on the ensemble chosen at the thermodynamic limit.
The grand canonical ensemble is an example of an open system.

=== Classical statistical mechanics ===

For a classical system in thermal equilibrium with its environment, the &quot;ensemble average&quot; takes the form of an integral over the phase space of the system:
: formula_17
where
: formula_18 is the ensemble average of the system property &quot;A&quot;,
: formula_19 is formula_20, known as thermodynamic beta,
: &quot;H&quot; is the Hamiltonian of the classical system in terms of the set of coordinates formula_21 and their conjugate generalized momenta formula_22,
: formula_23 is the volume element of the classical phase space of interest.

The denominator in this expression is known as the partition function and is denoted by the letter &quot;Z&quot;.

=== Quantum statistical mechanics ===

In quantum statistical mechanics, for a quantum system in thermal equilibrium with its environment, the weighted average takes the form of a sum over quantum energy states, rather than a continuous integral:
: formula_24

=== Canonical ensemble average ===
The generalized version of the partition function provides the complete framework for working with ensemble averages in thermodynamics, information theory, statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics.

The microcanonical ensemble represents an isolated system in which energy (&quot;E&quot;), volume (&quot;V&quot;) and the number of particles (&quot;N&quot;) are all constant. The canonical ensemble represents a closed system which can exchange energy (&quot;E&quot;) with its surroundings (usually a heat bath), but the volume (&quot;V&quot;) and the number of particles (&quot;N&quot;) are all constant. The grand canonical ensemble represents an open system which can exchange energy (&quot;E&quot;) and particles (&quot;N&quot;) with its surroundings, but the volume (&quot;V&quot;) is kept constant.

== Operational interpretation ==

In the discussion given so far, while rigorous, we have taken for granted that the notion of an ensemble is valid a priori, as is commonly done in physical context. What has not been shown is that the ensemble &quot;itself&quot; (not the consequent results) is a precisely defined object mathematically. For instance,
* It is not clear where this &quot;very large set of systems&quot; exists (for example, is it a &quot;gas&quot; of particles inside a container?)
* It is not clear how to physically generate an ensemble.

In this section, we attempt to partially answer this question.

Suppose we have a &quot;preparation procedure&quot; for a system in a physics lab: For example, the procedure might involve a physical apparatus and some protocols for manipulating the apparatus. As a result of this preparation procedure, some system is produced and maintained in isolation for some small period of time. By repeating this laboratory preparation procedure we obtain a sequence of systems &quot;X&quot;1, &quot;X&quot;2, ...,&quot;X&quot;&quot;k&quot;, which in our mathematical idealization, we assume is an infinite sequence of systems. The systems are similar in that they were all produced in the same way. This infinite sequence is an ensemble.

In a laboratory setting, each one of these prepped systems might be used as input for &quot;one&quot; subsequent &quot;testing procedure&quot;. Again, the testing procedure involves a physical apparatus and some protocols; as a result of the testing procedure we obtain a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer. Given a testing procedure &quot;E&quot; applied to each prepared system, we obtain a sequence of values Meas (&quot;E&quot;, &quot;X&quot;1), Meas (&quot;E&quot;, &quot;X&quot;2), ..., Meas (&quot;E&quot;, &quot;X&quot;&quot;k&quot;). Each one of these values is a 0 (or no) or a 1 (yes).

Assume the following time average exists:
: formula_25
For quantum mechanical systems, an important assumption made in the quantum logic approach to quantum mechanics is the identification of &quot;yes–no&quot; questions to the lattice of closed subspaces of a Hilbert space. With some additional technical assumptions one can then infer that states are given by density operators &quot;S&quot; so that:
: formula_26

We see this reflects the definition of quantum states in general: A quantum state is a mapping from the observables to their expectation values.

<text>Kobe ( ; , ), officially , is the capital city of Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan. With a population of around 1.5 million, Kobe is Japan&#x27;s seventh-largest city and the third-largest port city after Tokyo and Yokohama. It is located in the Kansai region, which makes up the southern side of the main island of Honshū, on the north shore of Osaka Bay. It is part of the Keihanshin metropolitan area along with Osaka and Kyoto. The Kobe city centre is located about west of Osaka and southwest of Kyoto.

The earliest written records regarding the region come from the , which describes the founding of the Ikuta Shrine by Empress Jingū in AD 201. For most of its history, the area was never a single political entity, even during the Tokugawa period, when the port was controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate. Kobe did not exist in its current form until its founding in 1889. Its name comes from . Kobe became one of Japan&#x27;s designated cities in 1956.

Kobe was one of the cities to open for trade with the West following the 1853 end of the policy of seclusion and has retained its cosmopolitan character ever since with a rich architectural heritage dating back to the Meiji era. While the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake diminished some of Kobe&#x27;s prominence as a port city, it remains Japan&#x27;s fourth-busiest container port. Companies headquartered in Kobe include ASICS, Kawasaki Heavy Industries, and Kobe Steel, while over 100 international corporations have their Asian or Japanese headquarters in the city, including Eli Lilly and Company, Procter &amp; Gamble, Boehringer Ingelheim, and Nestlé. The city is the point of origin and namesake of Kobe beef, the home of Kobe University, and the site of one of Japan&#x27;s most famous hot spring resorts, Arima Onsen.

==History==
===Origins===
Tools found in western Kobe demonstrate the area was populated at least from the Jōmon period.

The natural geography of the area, particularly of Wada Cape in Hyōgo-ku, led to the development of a port, which would remain the economic center of the city. Some of the earliest written documents mentioning the region include the , which describes the founding of the Ikuta Shrine by Empress Jingū in AD 201.
===Nara and Heian periods===
During the Nara and Heian periods, the port was known by the name and was one of the ports from which imperial embassies to China were dispatched. 
The city was briefly the capital of Japan in 1180, when Taira no Kiyomori moved his grandson Emperor Antoku to Fukuhara-kyō in present-day Hyōgo-ku. The Emperor returned to Kyoto after about five months.
Shortly thereafter in 1184, the Taira fortress in Hyōgo-ku and the nearby Ikuta Shrine became the sites of the Genpei War battle of Ichi-no-Tani between the Taira and Minamoto clans. The Minamoto prevailed, pushing the Taira further.
===Kamakura period===
As the port grew during the Kamakura period, it became an important hub for trade with China and other countries. In the 13th century, the city came to be known by the name . During this time, Hyōgo Port, along with northern Osaka, composed the province of Settsu (most of today&#x27;s Kobe belonged to Settsu except Nishi Ward and Tarumi Ward, which belonged to Harima).
===Edo period===
Later, during the Edo period, the eastern parts of present-day Kobe came under the jurisdiction of the Amagasaki Domain and the western parts under that of the Akashi Domain, while the center was controlled directly by the Tokugawa shogunate.
It was not until the abolition of the han system in 1871 and the establishment of the current prefecture system that the area became politically distinct.
===Meiji period===
Hyōgo Port was opened to foreign trade by the Shogunal government at the same time as Osaka on January 1, 1868, just before the advent of the Boshin War and the Meiji Restoration. At the time of the opening of the city for foreign trade, the area saw intense fighting resulting from the civil war in progress. Shortly after the opening of Kobe to trade, the Kobe Incident occurred, where several western soldiers sustained wounds from gunfire by troops from Bizen. The region has since been identified with the West and many foreign residences from the period remain in Kobe&#x27;s Kitano area.
=== Modern era ===
Kobe, as it is known today, was founded on April 1, 1889, and was designated on September 1, 1956 by government ordinance. The history of the city is closely tied to that of the Ikuta Shrine, and the name &quot;Kobe&quot; derives from , an archaic name for those who supported the shrine.

During World War II, Kobe was lightly bombed in the Doolittle Raid on April 18, 1942, along with Tokyo and a few other cities. Eventually, it was bombed again with incendiary bombs by B-29 Superfortress bombers on March 16 and 17, 1945, causing the death of 8,841 residents and the destruction of 21% of Kobe&#x27;s urban area. This incident inspired the well-known Studio Ghibli film &quot;Grave of the Fireflies&quot; and the book by Akiyuki Nosaka on which the film was based. It also features in the motion picture &quot;A Boy Called H&quot;.

Following continuous pressure from citizens, on March 18, 1975, the Kobe City Council passed an ordinance banning vessels carrying nuclear weapons from Kobe Port. This effectively prevented any U.S. warships from entering the port, because U.S. policy is to never disclose whether any given warship is carrying nuclear weapons. This nonproliferation policy has been termed the &quot;Kobe formula&quot;.

On January 17, 1995, a magnitude 6.9 earthquake occurred at 5:46 am JST near the city. About 6,434 people in the city were killed, 212,443 were made homeless, and large parts of the port facilities and other parts of the city were destroyed. The earthquake destroyed portions of the Hanshin Expressway, an elevated freeway that dramatically toppled over. In Japan, this earthquake is known as the Great Hanshin earthquake (or the Hanshin-Awaji earthquake). To commemorate Kobe&#x27;s recovery from it, the city holds an event every December called the Luminarie, where the city center is decorated with illuminated metal archways.

The Port of Kobe was Japan&#x27;s busiest port and one of Asia&#x27;s top ports until the Great Hanshin earthquake. Kobe has since dropped to fourth in Japan and, as of 2012, was the 49th-busiest container port worldwide.

== Geography ==
Wedged between the coast and the mountains, the city of Kobe is long and narrow. To the east is the city of Ashiya, while the city of Akashi lies to its west. Other adjacent cities include Takarazuka and Nishinomiya to the east and Sanda and Miki to the north.

The landmark of the port area is the red steel Port Tower. A ferris wheel sits in nearby Harborland, a notable tourist promenade. Two artificial islands, Port Island and Rokkō Island, have been constructed to give the city room to expand.

Away from the seaside at the heart of Kobe lie the Motomachi and Sannomiya districts, as well as Kobe&#x27;s Chinatown, Nankin-machi, all well-known retail areas. A multitude of train lines cross the city from east to west. The main transport hub is Sannomiya Station, with the eponymous Kobe Station located to the west and the Shinkansen Shin-Kobe Station to the north.

Mount Rokkō overlooks Kobe at an elevation of . During autumn, it is famous for the rich change in colors of its forests.

=== Wards ===

# Chūō-ku: literally means &quot;central&quot; and, as such, Chūō-ku is the commercial and entertainment center of Kobe. Sannomiya, Motomachi and Harborland make up the main entertainment areas in Kobe. Chūō-ku includes the city hall and Hyōgo prefectural government offices. Port Island and Kobe Airport lie in the southern part of this ward.
# Nada-ku: The site of Oji Zoo and Kobe University, Nada is known for its sake. Along with Fushimi in Kyoto, it accounts for 45% of Japan&#x27;s sake production.
# Higashinada-ku: The easternmost area of Kobe, Higashinada-ku borders the city of Ashiya. The man-made island of Rokko makes up the southern part of this ward.

<doc id="59057" wikidata="Q13989" url="?curid=59057" title="Honshu">
<text>, historically known as , is the largest of the four main islands of Japan. It lies between the Pacific Ocean (east) and the Sea of Japan (west). It is the seventh-largest island in the world, and the second-most populous after the Indonesian island of Java.

Honshu had a population of 104 million , constituting 81.3% of the entire population of Japan, and mostly concentrated in the coastal areas and plains. Approximately 30% of the total population resides in the Greater Tokyo Area on the Kantō Plain. As the historical center of Japanese cultural and political power, the island includes several past Japanese capitals, including Kyōto, Nara, and Kamakura. Much of the island&#x27;s southern shore forms part of the Taiheiyō Belt, a megalopolis that spans several of the Japanese islands. Honshu also contains Japan&#x27;s highest mountain, Mount Fuji, and its largest lake, Lake Biwa.

Most of Japan&#x27;s industry is located in a belt running along Honshu&#x27;s southern coast, from Tokyo to Nagoya, Kyōto, Osaka, Kobe, and Hiroshima. The island is linked to the other three major Japanese islands by a number of bridges and tunnels. The island primarily shares two climates, with Northern Honshu having four seasons with largely varying temperatures while the south experiences long, hot summers and cool to mild winters.

==Etymology==
The name of the island, , stems from Middle Chinese. It directly translates to &quot;main province&quot; or &quot;original land&quot; in English.

==History==
===Early history===
Humans first arrived in Honshu at least approximately 37,000 years ago. The first humans to arrive in Honshu were Stone Age hunter-gatherers from Northeast Asia, likely following the migration of ice age megafauna. Surviving artifacts from this period include finely-crafted stone blades, similar to those found in Siberia.

===Meiji Restoration===
The Meiji Restoration, in Japanese history, is the political revolution in 1868 that brought the final demise of the Tokugawa shogunate (which is a military government). It ended the Edo (Tokugawa) Period (1603-1867) and at least nominally returned control of the country to direct imperial rule under Mutsuhito (the Emperor Meiji). One of the main leaders of the restoration (who were mostly young samurai) was Chōshū in far western Honshu, which was one of the feudal, hostile to Tokugawa authority domains.

==Geography==
The island is roughly long and ranges from wide, and its total area is . It is slightly larger than Britain. Its land area has been increasing with land reclamation and coastal uplift in the north due to plate tectonics with a convergent boundary. Honshu has of coastline.

Mountainous and volcanic, Honshu experiences frequent earthquakes (such as the Great Kantō earthquake, which heavily damaged Tokyo in September 1923; and the earthquake of March 2011, which moved the northeastern part of the island by varying amounts of as much as while causing devastating tsunamis). The highest peak is the active volcano Mount Fuji at , which makes Honshu the world&#x27;s 7th highest island. There are many rivers, including the Shinano River, Japan&#x27;s longest. The Japanese Alps span the width of Honshu, from the &#x27;Sea of Japan&#x27; coast to the Pacific shore. Western Japan experiences a temperate climate with hot summers and cool to mild winters.

===Population===
Honshu has a total population of 104 million people, according to a 2017 estimate, 81.3% of the entire population of Japan. The largest city is Tokyo (population: 13,988,129), the capital of Japan and part of the Greater Tokyo Area, the most populous metropolitan area in the world.

===Extreme points===
====Bridges and tunnels====
Honshu is connected to the islands of Hokkaidō, Kyūshū and Shikoku by tunnels and bridges. Three bridge systems have been built across the islands of the Inland Sea between Honshu and Shikoku (Akashi Kaikyo Bridge and the Ōnaruto Bridge; Shin-Onomichi Bridge, Innoshima Bridge, Ikuchi Bridge, Tatara Bridge, Ōmishima Bridge, Hakata–Ōshima Bridge, and the Kurushima Kaikyō Bridge; Shimotsui-Seto Bridge, Hitsuishijima Bridge, Iwakurojima Bridge, Yoshima Bridge, Kita Bisan-Seto Bridge, and the Minami Bisan-Seto Bridge), the Seikan Tunnel connects Honshu with Hokkaidō, and the Kanmonkyo Bridge and Kanmon Tunnel connect Honshu with Kyūshū.

===Flora and fauna===
These are notable flora and fauna of Honshu.

===Geologic activity===

Being on the Ring of Fire, the island of Honshu is seismically active, and is home to 40 active volcanoes.

In 2011, an earthquake of magnitude 9.0–9.1 occurred off the coast of Honshu, generating tsunami waves up to 40.5 meters (133 ft) high and killing 19,747. It was the most powerful earthquake ever recorded in Japan, and the fourth most powerful earthquake in the world since modern record-keeping began in 1900. The tsunami subsequently led to the meltdown of 3 nuclear reactors at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant, leading to the Fukushima nuclear disaster.

===Parks===

==Economy==

Honshu island generates around US$3.5 trillion or more than 80% of Japan&#x27;s GDP.

===Agriculture===
Fruit, vegetables, grains, rice and cotton make up the main produce grown in Honshu. The Tōhoku region, spanning the north-eastern part of the island, is notable for its rice production, with 65% of cultivated land being rice paddy fields – almost a quarter of all paddy fields in Japan. Chiba Prefecture is famous for its peanuts, also being the largest producer in Japan. Rare species of the lichen genus Menegazzia are found only in Honshu.

===Industry===
Most of Japan&#x27;s tea and silk is from Honshu. Japan&#x27;s three largest industrial regions are all located on Honshu: the Keihin region, the Hanshin Industrial Region, and the Chūkyō Industrial Area.

===Minerals and fuels===
Honshu is home to a large portion of Japan&#x27;s minimal mineral reserves, including small oil and coal deposits. Several coal deposits are located in the northern part of the island, concentrated in Fukushima Prefecture and Niigata Prefecture, though Honshu&#x27;s coal production is negligible in comparison to Hokkaido and Kyushu. Most of Japan&#x27;s oil reserves are also located in northern Honshu, along the west coast, spanning Niigata, Yamagata, and Akita Prefectures.

Most of Japan&#x27;s copper, lead, zinc and chromite is located on Honshu, along with smaller, scattered deposits of gold, silver, arsenic, sulfur and pyrite.

==Transportation==
The Tokaido Shinkansen, opened in 1964 between Tokyo and Shin-Ōsaka, is Japan&#x27;s first high-speed rail line. It is the world&#x27;s oldest high-speed rail line and one of the most heavily used. The San&#x27;yō Shinkansen, connects the two largest cities in western Japan, Shin-Osaka in Osaka with Hakata Station in Fukuoka. Both the Tokaido Shinkansen and the Sanyo Shinkansen help form a continuous high-speed railway through the Taiheiyō Belt megalopolis.
==Administrative regions and prefectures==
The island is divided into five nominal regions and contains 34 prefectures, including metropolitan Tokyo. Administratively, some smaller islands are included within these prefectures, notably including the Ogasawara Islands, Sado Island, Izu Ōshima, and Awaji Island.

The regions and their prefectures are:

* Tōhoku region consists of six prefectures.
** 
** 
** 
* Kantō region consists of seven prefectures, including the capital of Japan which is the Tokyo Metropolis.
** 
** 
** 
* Chūbu region consists of nine prefectures.
** 
** 
** 
** 
* Kansai region consists of seven prefectures.
** 
** 
** 
* Chūgoku region consists of five prefectures.

<text>is the capital of Hiroshima Prefecture in Japan. , the city had an estimated population of 1,199,391. The gross domestic product (GDP) in Greater Hiroshima, Hiroshima Urban Employment Area, was US$61.3 billion as of 2010. Kazumi Matsui has been the city&#x27;s mayor since April 2011. The Hiroshima metropolitan area is the second largest urban area in the Chugoku Region of Japan, following the Okayama metropolitan area.

Hiroshima was founded in 1589 as a castle town on the Ōta River delta. Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, Hiroshima rapidly transformed into a major urban center and industrial hub. In 1889, Hiroshima officially gained city status. The city was a center of military activities during the imperial era, playing significant roles such as in the First Sino-Japanese War, the Russo-Japanese War, and the two world wars.

Hiroshima was the first military target of a nuclear weapon in history. This occurred on August 6, 1945, in the Pacific theatre of World War II, at 8:15 a.m., when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped the atomic bomb &quot;Little Boy&quot; on the city. Most of Hiroshima was destroyed, and by the end of the year between 90,000 and 166,000 had died as a result of the blast and its effects. The Hiroshima Peace Memorial (a UNESCO World Heritage Site) serves as a memorial of the bombing.

Since being rebuilt after the war, Hiroshima has become the largest city in the Chūgoku region of western Honshu.
== Geography ==
=== Climate ===
Hiroshima has a humid subtropical climate characterized by cool to mild winters and hot, humid summers. Like much of Japan, Hiroshima experiences a seasonal temperature lag in summer, with August rather than July being the warmest month of the year. Precipitation occurs year-round, although winter is the driest season. Rainfall peaks in June and July, with August experiencing sunnier and drier conditions.
===Wards===
Hiroshima has eight wards (&quot;ku&quot;):

===Demographics===

In 2017, the city had an estimated population of 1,195,327. The total area of the city is , with a population density of 1321 persons per km2. As of 2023, the city has a population of 1,183,696.

The population around 1910 was 143,000. Before World War II, Hiroshima&#x27;s population had grown to 360,000, and peaked at 419,182 in 1942. Following the atomic bombing in 1945, the population dropped to 137,197. By 1955, the city&#x27;s population had returned to pre-war levels.

==History==
=== Early history ===
The region where Hiroshima stands today was originally a small fishing village along the shores of Hiroshima Bay. From the 12th century, the village was rather prosperous and was economically attached to a Zen Buddhist temple called &quot;Mitaki-Ji&quot;. This new prosperity was partly caused by the increase of trade with the rest of Japan under the auspices of the Taira clan.

===Sengoku and Edo periods (1589–1871)===

Hiroshima was established on the delta coastline of the Seto Inland Sea in 1589 by powerful warlord Mōri Terumoto. Hiroshima Castle was quickly built, and in 1593 Mōri moved in. The name Hiroshima means wide island in Japanese. Terumoto was on the losing side at the Battle of Sekigahara. The winner of the battle, Tokugawa Ieyasu, deprived Mōri Terumoto of most of his fiefs, including Hiroshima and gave Aki Province to Masanori Fukushima, a &quot;daimyō&quot; (Feudal Lord) who had supported Tokugawa. From 1619 until 1871, Hiroshima was ruled by the Asano clan.
===Meiji and Showa periods (1871–1939)===
After the Han was abolished in 1871, the city became the capital of Hiroshima Prefecture. Hiroshima became a major urban center during the imperial period, as the Japanese economy shifted from primarily rural to urban industries. During the 1870s, one of the seven government-sponsored English language schools was established in Hiroshima. Ujina Harbor was constructed through the efforts of Hiroshima Governor Sadaaki Senda in the 1880s, allowing Hiroshima to become an important port city.

The San&#x27;yō Railway was extended to Hiroshima in 1894, and a rail line from the main station to the harbor was constructed for military transportation during the First Sino-Japanese War. During that war, the Japanese government moved temporarily to Hiroshima, and Emperor Meiji maintained his headquarters at Hiroshima Castle from September 15, 1894, to April 27, 1895. The significance of Hiroshima for the Japanese government can be discerned from the fact that the first round of talks between Chinese and Japanese representatives to end the Sino-Japanese War was held in Hiroshima, from February 1 to 4, 1895. New industrial plants, including cotton mills, were established in Hiroshima in the late 19th century. Further industrialization in Hiroshima was stimulated during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904, which required development and production of military supplies. The Hiroshima Prefectural Commercial Exhibition Hall was constructed in 1915 as a center for trade and the exhibition of new products. Later, its name was changed to Hiroshima Prefectural Product Exhibition Hall, and again to Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall. The building, now known as the A-Bomb Dome, part of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial, a World Heritage Site since 1996, permanently remains the only structure still standing and is a state of preserved ruin.

During World War I, Hiroshima became a focal point of military activity, as the Japanese government joined the Allied at war. About 500 German POWs were held in Ninoshima Island in Hiroshima Bay. The growth of Hiroshima as a city continued after the First World War, as the city now attracted the attention of the Catholic Church, and on May 4, 1923, an Apostolic Vicar was appointed for that city.
===World War II and the atomic bombing (1939–1945)===

During World War II, the Second General Army and Chūgoku Regional Army was headquartered in Hiroshima, and the Army Marine Headquarters was located at Ujina port. The city also had large depots of military supplies, and was a key center for shipping.

The bombing of Tokyo and other cities in Japan during World War II caused widespread destruction and hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths. There were no such air raids on Hiroshima. However, a real threat existed and was recognized. To protect against potential firebombings in Hiroshima, school children aged 11–14 years were mobilized to demolish houses and create firebreaks.

On Monday, August 6, 1945, at 8:15 a.m. (Hiroshima time), the American Boeing B-29 Superfortress, the &quot;Enola Gay&quot;, flown by Paul Tibbets (23 February 1915 – 1 November 2007), dropped the nuclear weapon &quot;Little Boy&quot; on Hiroshima, directly killing at least 70,000 people, including thousands of Korean slave laborers. Fewer than 10% of the casualties were military. By the end of the year, injury and radiation brought the total number of deaths to 90,000–140,000. The population before the bombing was around 345,000. About 70% of the city&#x27;s buildings were destroyed, and another 7% severely damaged.

The public release of film footage of the city following the attack, and some of the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission research on the human effects of the attack, were restricted during the occupation of Japan, and much of this information was censored until the signing of the Treaty of San Francisco in 1951, restoring control to the Japanese.

As Ian Buruma observed: 

The book &quot;Hiroshima&quot; by John Hersey was originally published in article form in the magazine &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, on August 31, 1946. It is reported to have reached Tokyo, in English, at least by January 1947 and the translated version was released in Japan in 1949. Although the article was planned to be published over four issues, &quot;Hiroshima&quot; made up the entire contents of one issue of the magazine. &quot;Hiroshima&quot; narrates the stories of six bomb survivors immediately before and four months after the dropping of the Little Boy bomb.

Oleander (&quot;Nerium&quot;) is the official flower of the city of Hiroshima because it was the first to bloom again after the explosion of the atomic bomb in 1945.
===Postwar period (1945–present)===

On September 17, 1945, Hiroshima was struck by the Makurazaki Typhoon (Typhoon Ida). Hiroshima Prefecture suffered more than 3,000 deaths and injuries, about half the national total. More than half the bridges in the city were destroyed, along with heavy damage to roads and railroads, further devastating the city.

From 1945 to 1952, Hiroshima came under occupation from the British Empire.

Hiroshima was rebuilt after the war, with help from the national government through the Hiroshima Peace Memorial City Construction Law passed in 1949. It provided financial assistance for reconstruction, along with land donated that was previously owned by the national government and used by the Imperial military.

In 1949, a design was selected for the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall, the closest surviving building to the location of the bomb&#x27;s detonation, was designated the Genbaku Dome (原爆ドーム) or &quot;Atomic Dome&quot;, a part of the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park. The Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum was opened in 1955 in the Peace Park. The historic castle of Hiroshima was rebuilt in 1958.

Hiroshima also contains a Peace Pagoda, built in 1966 by Nipponzan-Myōhōji. Uniquely, the pagoda is made of steel, rather than the usual stone.

Hiroshima was proclaimed a City of Peace by the Japanese parliament in 1949, at the initiative of its mayor, Shinzo Hamai (1905–1968). As a result, the city of Hiroshima received more international attention as a desirable location for holding international conferences on peace as well as social issues. As part of that effort, the Hiroshima Interpreters&#x27; and Guide&#x27;s Association (HIGA) was established in 1992 to facilitate interpretation for conferences, and the Hiroshima Peace Institute was established in 1998 within the Hiroshima University. The city government continues to advocate the abolition of all nuclear weapons and the Mayor of Hiroshima is the president of Mayors for Peace, an international Mayoral organization mobilizing cities and citizens worldwide to abolish and eliminate nuclear weapons by 2020.

On May 27, 2016, Barack Obama became the first sitting United States president to visit Hiroshima since the atomic bombing. The 49th annual G7 summit was held in Hiroshima in May 2023.

Hiroshima is situated on the Ōta River delta, on Hiroshima Bay, facing the Seto Inland Sea on its south side. The river&#x27;s six channels divide Hiroshima into several islets.

===Tramways===

Hiroshima is notable, in Japan, for its light rail system, nicknamed &quot;Hiroden&quot;, and the &quot;Moving Streetcar Museum&quot;. Streetcar service started in 1912, was interrupted by the atomic bomb, and was restored as soon as was practical. (Service between Koi/Nishi Hiroshima and Tenma-cho was started up three days after the bombing.)

Streetcars and light rail vehicles are still rolling down Hiroshima&#x27;s streets, including streetcars 651 and 652, which survived the atomic blast and are among the older streetcars in the system. When Kyoto and Fukuoka discontinued their trolley systems, Hiroshima bought them up at discounted prices, and, by 2011, the city had 298 streetcars, more than any other city in Japan.

===Cuisine===

Hiroshima is known for okonomiyaki, a savory (umami) pancake cooked on an iron plate, usually in front of the customer. It is cooked with various ingredients, which are layered rather than mixed as done with the Osaka version of okonomiyaki. The layers are typically egg, cabbage, bean sprouts (moyashi), sliced pork/bacon with optional items (mayonnaise, fried squid, octopus, cheese, mochi, kimchi, etc.), and noodles (soba, udon) topped with another layer of egg and a generous dollop of okonomiyaki sauce (Carp and Otafuku are two popular brands). The amount of cabbage used is usually 3 to 4 times the amount used in the Osaka style. It starts piled very high and is generally pushed down as the cabbage cooks. The order of the layers may vary slightly depending on the chef&#x27;s style and preference, and ingredients will vary depending on the preference of the customer.

<doc id="59064" wikidata="Q29164" url="?curid=59064" title="Akita (dog breed)">
<text>The is a Japanese dog breed of large size. Originating from the mountains of northern Japan, the Akita has a short double coat similar to that of many other northern spitz breeds. Historically, they were used by matagi for guarding and the hunting of bears.

The Akita is a powerful, dominant, and loyal breed, commonly aloof with strangers, but affectionate and deeply loyal to its family. As a breed, Akitas are generally hardy. The two separate varieties of Akita are a pure Japanese strain, called Akita Inu or Akita-ken, and a larger mixed strain, commonly referred to as the &quot;American Akita&quot;. However, it is subject to debate as to whether the Akita strains are distinct, or if they constitute one breed.

==Breed name==
Debate exists among fanciers whether these are two separate breeds of Akitas. As of 2020, the American Kennel Club now considers American and Japanese Akitas to be two separate breeds, no longer allowing free breeding between the two. The United Kennel Club, the Federation Cynologique Internationale (FCI), The Kennel Club, the Australian National Kennel Council, the New Zealand Kennel Club, and the Japan Kennel Club consider Japanese and American Akitas as separate breeds. Some countries refer to the American Akita as simply the Akita and not the American Akita. The issue is especially controversial in Japan. For the FCI&#x27;s 84 countries, the breed split formally occurred in June 1999, when the FCI decided that the American type would be called the Great Japanese Dog, later renamed the American Akita in January 2006.

==History==

===Japanese history===

Since ancient times, hunting dogs called were kept in the Tōhoku region of northern Japan. The word &quot;matagi&quot; means hunter. The main targets of hunting were Asian black bears, Japanese serows, Japanese macaques, and rabbits. In Akita Prefecture, there was also a matagi dog called the , which is a medium-sized dog and is distinguished from the Akita Inu. The direct ancestor of the Akita Inu was a dog kept as a guard dog and fighting dog by samurai and wealthy farmers in the Ōdate area, and was also known as the .

During the Edo period (1603 - 1867), the Akita region was ruled by the Satake clan of the Kubota Domain. The , the castle keeper of Ōdate Castle, is said to have nurtured the fighting spirit of its vassals through dogfighting.

It is not known exactly how Akita Inu became larger, but according to a &quot;discussion on dogs by old people&quot; held in 1931 in the then Ōdate Town, a famous dog named &quot;Moku&quot; was kept at the in Ōdate, commonly known as , in the late Edo period (1603-1867). Moku was a dog born at the end of the Ansei era (1854 - 1860), lived through the fires of the Boshin War (1868 - 1869), and lived until 1871 or 1872. Moku was about 85 cm tall at the shoulder and was large enough to carry an adult on its back. Moku was a purely Japanese dog with erect ears and a curly tail, sesame (&quot;goma&quot;) in color, and long hair. If this theory is to be believed, Akita Inu had become larger by the end of the Edo period at the latest.

In 1931, the Akita was officially declared a Japanese natural monument. The mayor of Odate City in Akita Prefecture organized the Akita Inu Hozonkai to preserve the original Akita as a Japanese natural treasure through careful breeding.

In 1933, Heishiro Takaku (Takahisa), one of the early members of Nippo in Tokyo and later of the Nipponinu Kyokai (Nikkyo) in Osaka and Katsuichi (Shoichi) each published articles on a proposed Japanese dog standard, which Included the Akita dog. Akita dogs revealed the most non-uniformity at that time, when compared to medium and small Japanese dogs, due to being outcrossed to the Tosa fighting dog, and other Imported foreign dogs. In 1934, the first Japanese breed standard for the Akita Inu was listed, following the breed&#x27;s declaration as a natural monument of Japan.

The Akita breed was used during the Russo-Japanese War to track prisoners of war and lost sailors. During World War II, the Akita was considered a non-military breed and was crossed with German Shepherds in an attempt to save them from the wartime government order for all non-military dogs to be culled. Some were used as scouts and guards during the war.

A native Japanese breed known as Matagi (hunting dog) was used along with the Hokkaido Inu breed to mix back into the remaining Akita dogs to restore the breed. There were many lines of Akita, but the most influential were the Dewa and Ichinoseki. Both lines contributed to the foundation stock for both Akita types, and many exported dogs were a combination of these lines. According to one Japanese judge, the greatest difference between Japanese- and American-bred Akitas is that the latter still show much evidence of the Dewa strain. In the early 1900s, Dewa-line Akitas were heavily favoured and did well in show. Kongo-go (from the Heirakudo Kennel of Eikichi Hiraizumi) is considered to be the most influential dog of that line.

However, the Dewa-line later went into a decline because Japanese breeders felt that the Akita did not give the impression of a Japanese dog, so began to breed towards an ideal type reminiscent of other Nihon-ken. The Dewa line was stereotyped as the “German Shepherd” type, while the Ichinoseki line was referred to as the “Mastiff” type. Thus, the Ichinoseki-line rose in popularity. Goromaru-Go was regarded as the most influential Akita of that line who, although didn&#x27;t perform well in show, produced outstanding Akita dogs when bred to Taihei and Nikkei lines from Southern Akita. Goromaru-Go then became foundation to further the Japanese type.

During the occupation years following the war, the breed began to thrive again through the efforts of Sawataishi and others. Morie Sawataishi and his efforts to breed the Akita is a major reason this breed exists today. For the first time, Akitas were bred for a standardized appearance. Akita fanciers in Japan began gathering and exhibiting the remaining Akitas and producing litters to restore the breed to sustainable numbers and to accentuate the ideal characteristics of the breed muddied by crosses to other breeds. It wasn&#x27;t until the 1960-70&#x27;s where the foxier Japanese type started to diverge from the typical American type.

The story of Hachikō helped push the Akita into the international dog world. Hachikō was born in 1923 and owned by Professor Hidesaburō Ueno of Tokyo. Professor Ueno lived near the Shibuya Train Station in a suburb of the city, and commuted to work every day on the train. Hachikō accompanied his master to and from the station each day. On May 25, 1925, when the dog was 18 months old, he waited for his master&#x27;s arrival on the four o&#x27;clock train, but Professor Ueno had suffered a fatal brain haemorrhage at work. Hachikō continued to wait for his master&#x27;s return. He travelled to and from the station each day for the next nine years. He allowed the professor&#x27;s relatives to care for him, but he never gave up the vigil at the station for his master. His vigil became world-renowned when, in 1934, shortly before his death, a bronze statue was erected at the Shibuya train station in his honor. This statue was melted down for munitions during the war, but a new one was commissioned after the war. Each year on March 8 since 1936, Hachikō&#x27;s devotion has been honoured with a solemn ceremony of remembrance at Tokyo&#x27;s Shibuya railroad station. Eventually, Hachikō&#x27;s legendary faithfulness became a national symbol of loyalty, particularly to the person and institution of the Emperor.

In 1967, commemorating the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Akita Dog Preservation Society, the Akita Dog Museum was built to house information, documents and photos. There is a tradition in Japan, that when a child is born they receive a statue of an Akita. This statue symbolizes health, happiness, and a long life.
In 1937, Helen Keller travelled to Japan. She expressed a keen interest in the breed and was presented with the first two Akitas to enter the US. The first dog, presented to her by Mr. Ogasawara and named Kamikaze-go, died at months of age from distemper, one month after her return to the States. A second Akita was arranged to be sent to Keller: Kamikaze&#x27;s litter brother, Kenzan-go. Keller nicknamed the dog Go-Go and they were great companions from day one. Go-Go even spent his first night at Keller&#x27;s home sleeping at the foot of her bed. Kenzan-go died in the mid-1940s. By 1939, a breed standard had been established and dog shows had been held, but such activities stopped after World War II began. Keller wrote in the &quot;Akita Journal&quot;:
===American history===

The Japanese Akita and American Akita began to diverge in type post-World War II due to America and Europe preserving the Akitas that fell out of favour in Japan, particularly the Dewa-types and dogs with the signature black mask or pinto marking. American Akitas are typically considered mixed by Japanese breeders (and not true Akitas by the Japanese standard). However, their phenotype predates the Japanese Akita by a few decades, and they are closer to pre-war Akitas like Hachiko.

Helen Keller is credited with bringing the Akita to America after being given two Akitas by the Japanese government in 1938. By 1939, a breed standard was established, and dog shows began to be held, but this development was interrupted by World War II. During this time, US servicemen serving as part of the occupation force in Japan first came into contact with the Akita. The breed so impressed them that many service members chose to bring an Akita back home with them upon completion of their tour.

Although both types derive from common ancestry, marked differences are seen between the two. American Akitas generally are heavier boned and larger, with a more bear-like head, whereas Japanese Akitas tend to be lighter and more finely featured with a fox-like head. Additionally, while American Akitas are acceptable in all colors, Japanese Akitas are only permitted to be red, white, or brindle. Additionally, American Akitas may be pinto and/or have black masks, unlike Japanese Akitas, where these are considered disqualifications and are not permitted in the breed standards.

Recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1955, the Akita was placed in the Miscellaneous class. The AKC did not approve the Akita standard until 1972, and it was moved to the Working Dog class. As such, the Akita is a rather new breed in the United States. Foundation stock in America continued to be imported from Japan until 1974, when the AKC cut off registration to any further Japanese imports until 1992, when it recognized the Japan Kennel Club standards. This decision set the stage for the divergence in type between the American Akita and Japanese Akita Inu that is present today.

Elsewhere in the world, one American Akita was first introduced to the UK in 1937. He was a Canadian import, owned by a Mrs. Jenson; the descendants of Mrs. Jenson live on today breeding American Akitas. The most widely known of these is Joseph Felton, an award-winning Akita breeder, but the breed was not itself widely known until the early 1980s. The breed was introduced in Australia in 1982 with an American import and to New Zealand in 1986 with an import from the UK.

===Appearance===
As a spitz breed, the appearance of the Akita reflects cold-weather adaptations essential to their original function. The Akita is a substantial breed for its height with heavy bones. Characteristic physical traits of the breed include a large, bear-like head with erect, triangular ears set at a slight angle following the arch of the neck. Additionally, the eyes of the Akita are small, dark, deeply set, and triangular in shape. Akitas have thick double coats, and tight, well-knuckled, cat-like feet. Their tails are carried over the tops of their backs in a gentle or double curl down the loin.

Mature American-type males measure typically 26-28 in (66–71 cm) at the withers and weigh between 100 and 130 lb (45–59 kg). Mature females typically measure 24-26 in (61–66 cm) and weigh between 70 and 100 lb (32–45 kg). The Japanese type, as stated in the breed standards, is a little smaller and lighter.

Breed standards state that all dog breed coat colors and patterns are allowable in the American Akita. This includes the common Shiba Inu coloring pattern known as &quot;urajiro&quot;. The Japanese Akitas, as per the breed standards, are restricted to red, fawn, sesame, brindle, and pure white, all with &quot;urajiro&quot; markings - whitish coat on the sides of the muzzle, on the cheeks, on the underside of jaw, neck, chest, body, and tail, and on the inside of the legs.

===Coat types===
The two coat types in the Akita are the standard coat length and the long coat. The long coat is considered a fault in the show ring, however. The long coat, also known as &quot;moku&quot;, is the result of an autosomal recessive gene and may occur phenotypically only if both sire and dam are carriers. They have longer (about 3-4 in long) and softer coats and are known to have sweeter temperaments. This gene is thought to come from the Karafuto Ken &quot;samurai&quot; dog.

==Temperament==
The Akita is generally seen as territorial about its property, and can be reserved with strangers.

The breed has been defined in some countries&#x27; breed-specific legislation as a dangerous dog. The Akita is a large, strong, independent, and dominant dog. A well-trained Akita should be accepting of nonthreatening strangers, otherwise they treat all strangers in an aggressive manner.

A survey on canine behaviour in five &#x27;ancient&#x27; breeds in Poland found the Akita to be the most aggressive towards other dogs with 59% of Akitas being reported to display aggression towards other dogs and animals. They were the second most likely to be aggressive towards humans with 13% of Akitas being reported to display aggression towards humans. Stereotypic behaviour was reported in 27% of Akitas, ranking it second out of the five breeds surveyed. Excessive vocalisation was only reported at 17% for the Akita, lower than the other breeds. Less than 10% of Akitas were reported to have separation anxiety, the lowest amount. 70% of all human directed aggression involved a visitor on the Akita&#x27;s territory, highlighting the defensive nature of the breed.

A Japanese study found that the CAG repeat polymorphism in the AR gene in the Akita Inu was correlated with increased reports of aggression in male Akita dogs, but not females.

==Health==
===Autoimmune diseases===
Many autoimmune diseases are known to occur in the Akita, including:
* Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada syndrome, also known as uveo-dermatologic syndrome, is an autoimmune condition that affects the skin and eyes.
* Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is an autoimmune blood disorder.
* Sebaceous adenitis is an autoimmune skin disorder believed to be of autosomal recessive inheritance.
* Pemphigus foliaceus is an autoimmune skin disorder, believed to be genetic.
* Systemic lupus erythematosus, or lupus, is a systemic autoimmune connective-tissue disease that can affect any part of the body.

===Immune-mediated endocrine diseases===
In addition to these, some immune-mediated endocrine diseases with a heritable factor can occur, such as:

* Hypoadrenocorticism, also known as Addison&#x27;s disease, affects the adrenal glands and is essentially the opposite of Cushing&#x27;s syndrome.
* Diabetes mellitus, also known as type 1 diabetes, affects the pancreas.
* Hypothyroidism, also known as autoimmune hypothyroidism, is an autoimmune disease that affects the thyroid gland.

===Nonimmune-specific conditions===
Other nonimmune-specific conditions known to have occurred in the Akita include:

* Gastric dilation, also known as bloat may progress to gastric dilatation volvulus, in which the stomach twists on itself.
* Microphthalmia, meaning &quot;small eyes&quot;, is a developmental disorder of the eye, believed to be an autosomal recessive genetic condition.
* Primary glaucoma, results increased pressure within the eyeball.
* Progressive retinal atrophy is a progressive degeneration of the retina (portion of the eye that senses light and allows sight).
* Hip dysplasia is a skeletal condition where the head of the femur does not fit properly into the hip socket it leads to osteoarthritis and pain.
* Elbow dysplasia is a skeletal condition in which the components of the elbow joint (the humerus, radius, and ulna) do not line up properly, leading to osteoarthritis and pain.
* Von Willebrand disease, is a genetic bleeding disorder caused by a deficiency in Von Willebrand factor.
* Cushing&#x27;s syndrome, also known as hyperadrenocorticism, affects the adrenal glands, and is caused by long-term exposure to high levels of glucocorticosteroids, either manufactured by the body or given as medications.

===Breed-specific conditions===
These breed-specific conditions are mentioned in veterinary literature:

* Immune sensitivity to vaccines, drugs, insecticides, anesthetics, and tranquilizers
* Pseudohyperkalemia is a rise in the level of potassium that occurs due to its excessive leakage from red blood cells (RBCs) when blood is drawn. This can give a false indication of hyperkalemia on lab tests, hence the prefix pseudo, meaning false. This occurs because many East Asian breeds, including Akitas and Shiba Inus, have a higher level of potassium in their RBCs than other dogs.

===Life expectancy===
A UK study found a life expectancy of 11.4 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

==Working life==
Predecessors of the modern Akita were used for hunting bear, wild boar, and deer in Japan as late as 1957. They would be used to flush out the boar and keep it at bay until the hunter could come and kill it. Today, the breed is used primarily as a companion dog, but is currently also known to be used as therapy dogs, and compete in all dog competitions, including conformation showing, obedience trials, canine good-citizen program, tracking trials, and agility competition, as well as weight pulling, hunting, and &quot;Schutzhunde&quot; (personal protection dogs).

<doc id="59068" wikidata="Q5686605" url="?curid=59068" title="Ascension of Jesus">
<text>The Ascension of Jesus (anglicized from the Vulgate ) is the Christian belief, reflected in the major Christian creeds and confessional statements, that Jesus ascended to Heaven after his resurrection, where he was exalted as Lord and Christ, sitting at the right hand of God. 

The Gospels and other New Testament writings imply resurrection and exaltation as a single event. The ascension is &quot;more assumed than described,&quot; and only Luke and Acts contain direct accounts of it, but with different chronologies.

In Christian art, the ascending Jesus is often shown blessing an earthly group below him, signifying the entire Church. The Feast of the Ascension is celebrated on the 40th day of Easter, always a Thursday; some Orthodox traditions have a different calendar up to a month later than in the Western tradition. The Lutheran Churches and the Anglican Communion continue to observe the Feast of the Ascension. Certain Nonconformist churches, such as the Plymouth Brethren, do not observe the feast.

== Biblical accounts ==
Although the ascension is an important article of faith in Christianity, only Luke and Acts contain direct accounts of it. In the shorter ending of Mark, in Matthew, and in John, it is only implied or alluded to. The Gospels do not picture resurrection and ascension as clearly separated in time. Other New Testament writings also imply resurrection and exaltation as a single event.

Various epistles (, , , , , and ) refer to an ascension without specifying details, seeming, like Luke–Acts and John, to equate it with the post-resurrection &quot;exaltation&quot; of Jesus to the right hand of God.

The ascension is detailed in both Luke and Acts, a pair of works ascribed to the same author, Luke the Evangelist: 
* Luke 24:51: Jesus leads the eleven remaining disciples to Bethany, a village on the Mount of Olives, and instructs them to remain in Jerusalem until the coming of the Holy Spirit: &quot;And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he parted from them, and was carried up into heaven. And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.&quot; 
* Acts 1 (): Jesus tells the disciples to remain in Jerusalem and await the coming of the Holy Spirit; he is then taken up from the disciples in their sight, a cloud hides him from view, and two men in white appear to tell them that he will return &quot;in the same way you have seen him go into heaven.&quot;

Luke and Acts appear to describe the same event but present quite different chronologies, the gospel placing it on the same day as the resurrection and Acts forty days afterwards; various proposals have been put forward to resolve the contradiction, but none have been found satisfactory. According to Dunn, the author of Acts separated the resurrection and ascension to put a limit on the number of resurrection appearances, effectively excluding Paul&#x27;s conversion experience from the &quot;bona fide&quot; resurrection appearances. Zwiep argues that Jesus was originally believed to have been exalted with his ascension to heaven and seated at the right hand of God with his resurrection until the late first century where he argues the exaltation had been separated from the resurrection, and moved to a final ascension into heaven after his appearances on earth. Other scholars note that the biblical authors tended to conflate or compress different events and narrate them as one which was a literary theme seen in other ancient biographies to improve the narrative flow. Such scholars caution against a strictly chronological reading.

John&#x27;s Gospel has three references to ascension in Jesus&#x27; own words: &quot;No one has ascended into heaven but he who descended from heaven, the Son of Man&quot; (); &quot;What if you [the disciples] were to see the Son of Man ascending where he was before?&quot; (); and to Mary Magdalene after his resurrection, &quot;Do not hold me, for I have not yet ascended to my Father...&quot; (John 20:17). In the first and second Jesus is claiming to be the apocalyptic &quot;one like a Son of Man&quot; of Daniel 7; the last has mystified commentators – why should Mary be prohibited from touching the risen but not yet ascended Christ, while Thomas is later invited to do so? 

The longer ending of Mark describes an ascension, but is a later addition to the original version of that gospel.

== Views on the Ascension ==
===Background===
Ascension stories were fairly common around the time of Jesus and the evangelists, signifying the deification of a noteworthy person (usually a Roman Emperor), and in Judaism as an indication of divine approval. Another function of heavenly ascent was as a mode of divine revelation reflected in Greco-Roman, early Jewish, and early Christian literary sources, in which particular individuals with prophetic or revelatory gifts are said to have experienced a heavenly journey during which they learned cosmic and divine secrets. 

Figures familiar to Jews would have included Enoch (from the Book of Genesis and a popular non-Biblical work called 1 Enoch); the 5th-century sage Ezra; Baruch the companion of the prophet Jeremiah (from a work called 2 Baruch, in which Baruch is promised he will ascend to heaven after forty days); Levi the ancestor of priests; the Teacher of Righteousness from the Qumran community; the prophet Elijah (from 2 Kings); Moses, who was deified on entering heaven; and the children of Job, who according to the Testament of Job ascended heaven following their resurrection from the dead. 

Non-Jewish readers would have been familiar with the case of the emperor Augustus, whose ascent was witnessed by Senators; Romulus the founder of Rome, who, like Jesus, was taken to heaven in a cloud; the Greek hero Heracles (Hercules); and others.

===Theology===
In Christian theology, the death, resurrection, and exaltation of Jesus are the most important events, and a foundation of the Christian faith. The early followers of Jesus believed that God had vindicated Jesus after his death, as reflected in the stories about his resurrection, ascension, and exaltation. The early followers of Jesus soon believed that Jesus was raised as first of the dead, taken into Heaven, and exalted, taking the seat at the right hand of God in Heaven, as stated in the Apostles&#x27; Creed: &quot;He ascended into heaven, and is seated at the right hand of God the Father almighty.&quot; Psalm 110 () played an essential role in this interpretation of Jesus&#x27; death and the resurrection appearances: &quot;The Lord said to my Lord, &quot;Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool.&quot; It provided an interpretative frame for Jesus&#x27; followers to make sense of his death and the resurrection appearances.

This understanding is summarized by the theologian Justus Knecht who wrote: &quot;Our Lord went up Body and Soul into heaven in the sight of His apostles, by His own power, to take possession of His glory, and to be our Advocate and Mediator in heaven with the Father. He ascended as Man, as Head of the redeemed, and has prepared a dwelling in heaven for all those who follow in His steps (Sixth article of the Creed).&quot;

The apostle Paul cites Psalm 68, attributed to King David, celebrates divine triumph and benevolence, invoking God&#x27;s power in leading and providing for His people. Many interpreters see this psalm as recounting the historical journey of the Ark of the Covenant through the desert and its eventual ascent to Zion, especially highlighted in verses 1-3 () and 18 (). This movement of the Ark ascending Mount Zion is seen in the New Testament as a prefiguration of the ascension of Jesus. Notably, verse 18, &quot;You ascended on high, leading a host of captives in your train and receiving gifts among men,&quot; is referenced by the Apostle Paul in Ephesians 4:8 (), underscoring its messianic significance and linking it directly to Christ&#x27;s ascension.

=== Cosmology ===

The cosmology of the author of Luke–Acts reflects the beliefs of his age, which envisioned a three-part cosmos with the heavens above, an Earth centered on Jerusalem in the middle, and the underworld below. Heaven was separated from the Earth by the firmament, the visible sky, a solid inverted bowl where God&#x27;s palace sat on pillars in the celestial sea. Humans looking up from Earth saw the floor of Heaven, made of clear blue lapis-lazuli (), as was God&#x27;s throne (). According to Dunn, &quot;the typical mind-set and worldview of the time conditioned what was actually seen and how the recording of such seeings was conceptualized,&quot; and &quot;departure into heaven could only be conceived in terms of &#x27;being taken up &#x27;, a literal ascension.&quot; 

In modern times, a literal reading of the ascension-stories has become problematic, due to the differences between the pre-scientific cosmology of the times of Jesus, and the scientific worldview that leaves no place for a Heaven above earth. Theologian James Dunn describes the Ascension as at best a puzzle and at worst an embarrassment for an age that no longer conceives of a physical Heaven located above the Earth. Similarly, in the words of McGill University&#x27;s Douglas Farrow, in modern times the ascension is seen less as the climax of the mystery of Christ than as &quot;something of an embarrassment in the age of the telescope and the space probe,&quot; an &quot;idea [that] conjures up an outdated cosmology.&quot; 

Yet, according to Dunn, a sole focus on this disparity is beside the real importance of Jesus&#x27; ascension, namely the resurrection and subsequent exaltation of Jesus. Farrow notes that, already in the third century, the ascension-story was read by Origen in a mystical way, as an &quot;ascension of the mind rather than of the body,&quot; representing one of two basic ascension theologies. The real problem is the fact that Jesus is both present and absent, an ambiguity which points to a &quot;something more&quot; to which the Eucharist gives entry.

===Islam===
The same doctrine takes on another meaning for Muslims: most Islamic scholars hold that Jesus, the penultimate prophet of Islam, was not crucified or resurrected but his body directly ascended.

===Nonreligious views===
Russian skeptic Kirill Eskov in his &quot;Nature&quot;-praised work The Gospel of Afranius argues that it was politically prudent for the local Roman administration to strengthen Jesus&#x27;s influence by spreading rumors about his miracles via active measures, with this story originating as a well-crafted deliberate lie.

== Liturgy: Feast of the Ascension ==


The Feast of the Ascension is a major feast day of the Christian liturgical year, along with the Passion, Easter, Pentecost, and Christmas. Ascension Day is traditionally celebrated on the sixth Thursday after Easter Sunday, the fortieth day from Easter day, although some Catholic provinces have moved the observance to the following Sunday to facilitate the obligation to attend Mass. Saint Jerome held that it was of apostolic origin, but in fact the Ascension was originally part of Pentecost (the coming of the Holy Spirit), and developed as a separate celebration only slowly from the late 4th century onward. In the Catholic tradition it begins with a three-day &quot;rogation&quot; to ask for God&#x27;s mercy, and the feast itself includes a procession of torches and banners symbolising Christ&#x27;s journey to the Mount of Olives and entry into Heaven, the extinguishing of the Paschal candle, and an all-night vigil; white is the liturgical colour. The feast was retained at the Protestant Reformation. It continues to be observed in Lutheran, Anglican, Methodist, and most Reformed churches. Most of the Eastern Christian tradition (Eastern and Oriental Orthodox and some Eastern Catholic Churches, and the Church of the East), based on the Julian calendar, has a slightly different computation, up to a month later than in the Western tradition. Other denominations, such as the Plymouth Brethren and Quakers, do not celebrate it as they do not adhere to the traditional Christian calendar of feasts.

One of the Ascension hymns is Christ fuhr gen Himmel.

== In Christian art ==

The Ascension of Jesus has been a frequent subject in Christian art. By the 6th century, the iconography of the Ascension had been established and by the 9th century, ascension scenes were being depicted on domes of churches. The Rabbula Gospels (c. 586) include some of the earliest images of the ascension. Many ascension scenes have two parts, an upper (Heavenly) part and a lower (earthly) part. The ascending Christ may be carrying a resurrection cross-banner or make a sign of benediction with his right hand. The blessing gesture by Christ with his right hand is directed towards the earthly group below him and signifies that he is blessing the entire Church. In the left hand, he may be holding a Gospel or a scroll, signifying teaching and preaching.

The Eastern Orthodox portrayal of the ascension is a major metaphor for the mystical nature of the Church. In many Eastern icons, the Virgin Mary is placed at the center of the scene in the earthly part of the depiction, with her hands raised towards Heaven, often accompanied by various Apostles. The upwards-looking depiction of the earthly group matches the Eastern liturgy on the Feast of the Ascension: &quot;Come, let us rise and turn our eyes and thoughts high ...&quot;

=== Olivet and the Chapel of the Ascension ===
The traditional site of the ascension is Mount Olivet (the &quot;Mount of Olives&quot;), on which the village of Bethany sits. Before the conversion of Constantine the Great in 312 AD, early Christians honored the ascension of Christ in a cave on the Mount, and by 384 the ascension was venerated on the present site, uphill from the cave.

Around the year 390 a wealthy Roman woman named Poimenia financed construction of the original church called &quot;Eleona Basilica&quot; (&quot;elaion&quot; in Greek means &quot;olive garden&quot;, from &quot;elaia&quot; &quot;olive tree&quot;, and has an oft-mentioned similarity to &quot;eleos&quot; meaning &quot;mercy&quot;). This church was destroyed by Sassanid Persians in 614. It was subsequently rebuilt, destroyed, and rebuilt again by the Crusaders. This final church was later destroyed by Muslims, leaving only a 12×12 meter octagonal structure (called a &quot;martyrium&quot;—&quot;memorial&quot;—or &quot;edicule&quot;) that remains to this day. The site was ultimately acquired by two emissaries of Saladin in the year 1198 and has remained in the possession of the Islamic Waqf of Jerusalem ever since. The Russian Orthodox Church also maintains a convent of the ascension on the top of the Mount of Olives.

<text>German submarine &quot;U-691&quot; was a Type VIIC/41 U-boat of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; during World War II. Her construction by Howaldtswerke of Hamburg was ordered on 2 April 1942, suspended on 30 September 1943, and cancelled on 22 July 1944. The new Elektro Boat XXI design had made the Type VIIs obsolete.

==In fiction==
Neal Stephenson&#x27;s novel &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; includes a fictitious &quot;U-691&quot;, a Type IXD/42, launched at Wilhelmshaven on 19 September 1940 (four years before IXD/42s were actually developed) and fitted with an experimental &quot;schnorkel&quot;.

<text>German submarine &quot;U-553&quot; was a Type VIIC U-boat built for Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; for service during World War II.

==Design==
German Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines. &quot;U-553&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie GG UB 720/8 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-553&quot; was fitted with five torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen torpedoes, one SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and a C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty.

==Service history==
Her keel was laid down 21 November 1939, by Blohm &amp; Voss in Hamburg as yard number 529. She was launched on 7 November 1940 and commissioned on 23 December, with &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot; Karl Thurmann in command. He was captain for her entire career.

Her service began with training under the 7th U-boat Flotilla and moved on to operations on 1 April 1941. She then transferred to the 3rd flotilla on 1 December 1942. She was a member of ten wolfpacks. She moved from Kiel in Germany to Bergen in Norway in April 1941.

===First patrol===
The boat departed Bergen on 19 April 1941 and headed for the Atlantic via the gap between the Faeroe and Shetland Islands. She arrived at her new base of St. Nazaire in occupied France on 2 May 1941 after suffering serious engine trouble.

===Second patrol===
Departing St. Nazaire on 7 June, she achieved success north of the Azores, by sinking the &quot;Susan Maersk&quot; (she went down in 90 seconds) and the &quot;Ranella&quot; (she broke in two) both on 12 June 1941.

===Third, fourth and fifth patrols===
Her next three sorties met with mixed fortune; her third patrol saw no success, despite ranging far and wide over the north Atlantic.

&quot;U-553&quot;″s next foray saw her attack merchantmen such as the &quot;Silvercedar&quot;, (sunk on 15 October 1941) and (sunk on 17 October).

The boat&#x27;s fifth patrol took her toward the eastern Canadian/US coast where she succeeded in damaging the &quot;Diala&quot; on 15 January 1942 and sinking the &quot;Innerøy&quot; on 22 January.

===Sixth and seventh patrols===
The boat&#x27;s sixth patrol took her from St. Nazaire as far north as the Faeroe Islands. It was unsuccessful.

Outing number seven saw the submarine penetrate the Gulf of St. Lawrence where she sank two ships; the &quot;Leto&quot; and the &quot;Nicoya&quot;. The &quot;Mattawin&quot; was sent to the bottom of the Atlantic.

===Eighth patrol===
The boat&#x27;s eighth patrol began with her departure from St. Nazaire on 19 July and to which she returned on 17 September after 61 days at sea, her longest. In that time, she damaged the &quot;Belgian Soldier&quot; off Newfoundland and attacked three other ships near Cuba. one of which, the &quot;Empire Bede&quot;, was sunk by gunfire from .

===Ninth patrol===
Her last full patrol commenced on 23 November 1942; she sank the &quot;Charles L D&quot; on 9 December 1942. She returned to France, but this time La Pallice on 18 December.

===Loss===
Her tenth and final sortie began with her departure from La Pallice on 16 January 1943. On the 20th, she sent a radio message: &quot;Sehrohr unklar&quot; (periscope unready for action), and was never heard from again. She had suffered no casualties to her crew until lost with all hands. She most probably sank because of technical problems and was officially declared missing on 28 January 1943.

===Wolfpacks===
&quot;U-553&quot; took part in ten wolfpacks, namely:
* West (13 – 20 June 1941) 
* Grönland (10 – 23 August 1941) 
* Kurfürst (23 August – 2 September 1941) 
* Seewolf (2 – 13 September 1941) 
* Zieten (6 – 22 January 1942) 
* Westwall (2 – 12 March 1942) 
* York (12 – 26 March 1942) 
* Pirat (29 July – 3 August 1942) 
* Draufgänger (29 November – 11 December 1942) 
* Landsknecht (19 – 20 January 1943)

==Summary of raiding history==
==U-553 in fiction==
Neal Stephenson&#x27;s novel Cryptonomicon includes a fictitious U-553 which runs aground about ten miles north of Qwghlm, a fictional pair of islands, Inner Qwghlm and Outer Qwghlm, off the northwestern coast of Great Britain.

<doc id="59077" wikidata="Q27737" url="?curid=59077" title="Consumer education">
<text>Consumer education is the preparation of an individual to be capable of making informed decisions when it comes to purchasing products in a consumer culture. It generally covers various consumer goods and services, prices, what the consumer can expect, standard trade practices, etc. While consumer education can help consumers to make more informed decisions, some researchers have found that its effects can drop off over time, suggesting the need for continual education. New dimensions of consumer education are also beginning to emerge as people become more aware of the need for ethical consumerism and sustainable consumer behaviour in our increasingly globalized society.

== Background ==
Consumer education is an education that can be found in several areas of study in the formal school curriculum and incorporated knowledge from many disciplines, including: economics, game theory, information theory, law, mathematics, and psychology. The goal of teaching the subject is to help people understand in what ways we, as humans, traditionally make oversights in decision-making, so that we can be more self-aware and try to use that information to make more critical and useful decisions. It is especially important in a consumerist society, where many options are available, but rarely ever of equal quality, and where many options take advantage of our biases when we lack complete information, are in need of something urgently (like food while grocery shopping), our preference for familiar and common things, or when we have uneasy feelings. Training for teachers also include instruction regarding different branches of consumerism.

Consumer education focuses on both functional skills and rights. These two elements are inseparable in the sense that awareness of several rights leads to functional skills. There are also instances when consumer education is conducted for the purpose of changing consumer perceptions, such as the educational drive to increase consumer confidence in for example e-commerce.

==Subject matter==
Traditionally, the subject matter taught in consumer education would be found under the label home economics. Beginning in the late 20th century, however, with the rise of consumerism, the need for an individual to manage a budget, make informed purchases, and save for the future have become paramount. The outcomes of consumer education include not only the improved understanding of consumer goods and services, but also increased awareness of the consumer&#x27;s rights in the consumer market and better capability to take actions to improve consumer well-being.

Subjects included in consumer education also vary from country to country. For instance, in the United Kingdom the focus is on the protection of children from the effects of exploitative consumer society, while in the Philippines the emphasis is more on issues related to the more immediate public interest (e.g., boiling water before drinking it, examining sugar for impurities).

== Consumer education for families ==
Consumer education helps families gain information to make cost effective choices in child care. The goal for consumer education for families is to reduce the financial burden to quality child care by reviewing trusted information to become their own advocates. This is done by providing education to parents on the awareness of early education and childcare as well as the financial assistance that may be needed by low income families to attend public or private pre-K facilities. The National Center for Children in Poverty (NCCP) defines consumer education for families as raising awareness on child care that meets the familial demands through a continuum of skills to expand knowledge, increase variety, and an increase in resources that families can use.

== Consumer education around the world ==
In multiple countries home economists have contributed in strengthening these programs aimed at women, families, and children. These programs aim to teach women formally and informally education, increase understanding and appreciation of other cultures, improving public health, and improving the process of introducing change.

A few professional organizations have facilitated international involvement. Some of these include the International Federation of Home Economics (IFHE), American Home Economics Association now the American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences (AAFCS), and the American Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges (AASULGC) now the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges (NASULGC).

Economists in the United States become more involved outside their country around the twentieth century when mission boards hired graduates to assist in establishing home economics departments in other countries to improve living conditions of the people. In the United States, a few states have set up consumer education programs that aim at educating future populations. Texas Office of Consumer Credit Consumer aims to educate Texans to be financially literate and to make good decisions as a consumer.

In Australia, consumer education starts in years 9 and 10 as an elective course during their educational career.

== Health and nutrition in consumerism ==
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for protecting the public health by assuring the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary drugs, biological products, medical devices, our nation&#x27;s food supply, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation. The FDA also provides accurate, science-based health information to the public. Making any health claims without the FDA reviewing it first is illegal. This is not the case for structural or functional claims on conventional food.

Consumers are becoming increasingly health-conscious and most agree that eating healthy is a better way to prevent illness than using medication. An increased consciousness of eating healthy among consumers has led to more consumers buying functional foods who are marketed with scientifically substantiated claims to improve health and well-being. The American dietetic Association supports the use of health claims that have previously been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but stresses the importance of health claims on food being supported by a program of health and nutrition. Multiple sources have to support these claims to make sure there are no unbalanced messages received by the consumer.

Common findings from studies on health and nutrition in consumerism were:

* Health claims on food are seen by consumers as useful, and when a product features a health claim consumers view it as healthier and state, they are more likely to purchase it.
* Consumers are skeptical when companies make the claim of their product having health benefits but strongly agree when the government makes a claim.
* Consumers do not clearly distinguish between nutrition content claims, structure function claims and health claims.

To make sure consumers are being influenced by the claims that are made, it is important that consumers are being exposed and pay attention to the claim, that they have an understanding of the claim and that they have a change in their attitude and belief. after that it is important to maintain this behavior change.

<doc id="59084" wikidata="Q2725641" url="?curid=59084" title="Arena Football League">
<text>The Arena Football League (AFL) was a professional arena football league in the United States. It was founded in 1986, but played its first official games in the 1987 season, making it the third longest-running professional football league in North America after the Canadian Football League (CFL) and the National Football League (NFL) until the AFL closed in 2019. 

The AFL played a formerly proprietary code known as arena football, a form of indoor American football played on a 66-by-28 yard field (about a quarter of the surface area of an NFL field), with rules encouraging offensive performance, resulting in a typically faster-paced and higher-scoring game compared to NFL games. The sport was invented in the early 1980s and patented by Jim Foster, a former executive of the United States Football League (USFL) and the NFL. Each of the league&#x27;s 32 seasons culminated in the ArenaBowl, with the winner being crowned the league&#x27;s champion for that season.

From 2000 to 2009, the AFL had its own developmental league, the af2. The AFL played 22 seasons from 1987 to 2008; internal issues caused the league to cancel its 2009 season, though the af2 did play. Later that year both the AFL and af2 were dissolved and reorganized as a new corporation comprising teams from both leagues, and the AFL returned in 2010. The league&#x27;s average game attendance after returning in 2010 was approximately 9,500.

The league historically had a nationwide footprint, and was recognized as the most prominent professional indoor football league in North America, offering higher payment, more widespread media exposure, and a longer history than competing leagues. From a high of 19 teams in 2007, the league contracted to a low of four teams in 2018, all in the northeastern United States. There were six teams playing in 2019, the league&#x27;s final season.

On October 29, 2019, league commissioner Randall Boe confirmed reports that the league had discontinued operating teams in local markets for the 2020 season. Four weeks later on November 27, league commissioner Boe announced via Twitter that the league as a whole had filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, dissolving the league for the second time.

==History==
===Creation===
Jim Foster, a promotions manager with the National Football League, conceived of indoor football while watching an indoor soccer match at Madison Square Garden in 1981. While at the game, he wrote his idea on a 9 x 12 envelope, with sketches of the field and notes on gameplay. He presented the idea to a few friends at the NFL offices, where he received praise and encouragement for his concept. After solidifying the rules and a business plan, and supplemented with sketches by a professional artist, Foster presented his idea to various television networks. He reached an agreement with NBC for a &quot;test game&quot;.

Plans for arena football were put on hold in 1982 as the United States Football League was launched. Foster left the NFL to accept a position in the USFL. He eventually became executive vice-president with the Chicago Blitz, where he returned to his concept of arena football. In 1983, he began organizing the test game in his spare time from his job with the Blitz. By 1985, the USFL had ceased football operations and he began devoting all his time to arena football, and on April 27, 1986, his concept was realized when the test game was played.

The test game was played in Rockford, Illinois, on April 27, 1986, at the Rockford MetroCentre. Sponsors were secured, and players and coaches from local colleges were recruited to volunteer to play for the teams, the Chicago Politicians and Rockford Metros, with the guarantee of a tryout should the league take off. Interest was high enough following the initial test game that Foster decided to put on a second, &quot;showcase&quot; game. The second game was held on February 27, 1987, at the Rosemont Horizon in Chicago with a budget of $20,000, quintuple the $4,000 for the test game. Foster also invited ESPN to send a film crew to the game; a highlights package aired on &quot;SportsCenter&quot;.

===Inaugural season===

Following the successes of his trial-run games, Foster moved ahead with his idea for arena football. He founded the Arena Football League with four teams: the Pittsburgh Gladiators, Denver Dynamite, Washington Commandos, and Chicago Bruisers. Foster appointed legendary Darrel &quot;Mouse&quot; Davis, godfather of the &quot;run and shoot&quot; and modern pro offenses, as executive director of football operations. Davis hired the original coaches and was the architect of the league&#x27;s original wide-open offensive playbooks.

The first game in Arena Football League history was played on June 19, 1987, between the Gladiators and Commandos at Pittsburgh Civic Arena in front of 12,117 fans. The game was deliberately not televised so that it could be analyzed and any follies and failures would not be subject to national public scrutiny. Following the inaugural game, tweaks and adjustments were made, and the first season continued. The Dynamite and Bruisers played in the first-ever televised AFL game the next night, on June 20, 1987, at the Rosemont Horizon in suburban Chicago on ESPN with Bob Rathbun and Lee Corso calling the play-by-play. The broadcast showed a short clip of the Commandos-Gladiators game. Each team played six games, two against each other team. The top two teams, Denver and Pittsburgh, then competed in the first-ever AFL championship game, ArenaBowl I.

On September 30, 1987, Foster filed an application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office to patent his invented sport. The patent application covered the rules of the game, specifically detailing the goalposts and rebound netting and their impact on gameplay. Foster&#x27;s application was granted on March 27, 1990. The patent expired on March 27, 2007.

===Early years (1987–1999)===
From its inception, the AFL operated in a state of semi-obscurity; many Americans had heard the term &quot;arena football&quot; but knew little to nothing about the league itself.

From the 1987 season until the late 1990s, the most exposure the league would receive was on ESPN, which aired tape-delayed games, often well after midnight, and often edited to match the allotted time slot. The league received its first taste of wide exposure in 1998, when Arena Bowl XII was televised nationally as part of ABC&#x27;s old &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;.

On July 23, 1989, much of America learned of the AFL for an unintended reason, when the Pittsburgh Gladiators&#x27; head coach, Joe Haering, made football history by punching commissioner Jim Foster during a game with the Chicago Bruisers. The national media ran with the story, including a photo in &quot;USA Today&quot;. The game was played between the two teams in Sacramento&#x27;s ARCO Arena, as part of the AFL&#x27;s &#x27;Barnstorming America&#x27; tour. Foster had walked onto the field of play to mediate an altercation between the two teams when Haering, a former NFL assistant, punched him in the jaw. Haering was suspended without pay.

One of the league&#x27;s early success stories was the Detroit Drive. A primary team for some of the AFL&#x27;s most highly regarded players, including George LaFrance and Gary and Alvin Rettig, as well as being a second career chance for quarterback Art Schlichter, the Drive regularly played before sold-out crowds at Joe Louis Arena, and went to the ArenaBowl every year of their existence (1988–1993). The AFL&#x27;s first dynasty came to an end when their owner, Mike Ilitch (who also owned Little Caesars Pizza and the Detroit Red Wings) bought the Detroit Tigers and sold the AFL team.

Although the Drive moved to Massachusetts, becoming the Massachusetts Marauders for the 1994 season, the AFL had a number of other teams which it considered &quot;dynasties&quot; between 1994 and 2016. The most successful of these were the Tampa Bay Storm and their arch-rival the Orlando Predators, as well as the San Jose SaberCats and their rivals, the Arizona Rattlers. Among those four teams, they won 14 of 22 ArenaBowls in that time span and appeared in all but two.

In 1993, the league staged its first All-Star Game in Des Moines, Iowa, the future home of the long-running Iowa Barnstormers, as a fundraiser for flood victims in the area. The National Conference defeated the American Conference 64–40 in front of a crowd of 7,189. The second All-Star event was in October 2013, with two games, the first in Honolulu, Hawai&#x27;i, the second being in Beijing, China.

While some teams have enjoyed considerable on-field and even financial success, many teams in the history of the league have enjoyed little success either on or off of the field of play. There were a number of franchises which existed in the form of a series of largely-unrelated teams with little to no continuity of either coaching staffs or players under numerous management groups until they folded. One example of several which could be cited is the New York CityHawks, whose owners transferred the team from New York City to Hartford to become the New England Sea Wolves after two seasons, then after another two seasons were sold and became the Toronto Phantoms, which lasted another two seasons until folding. There are a number of reasons why these teams failed, including financially weak ownership groups, lack of deep financial support from some owners otherwise capable of providing it, lack of media exposure, and the host city&#x27;s evident lack of interest in its team or the sport as a whole.

===The new millennium (2000–2008)===
The year 2000 brought heightened interest in the AFL. Then-St. Louis Rams quarterback Kurt Warner, who was MVP of Super Bowl XXXIV, was first noticed because he played quarterback for the AFL&#x27;s Iowa Barnstormers. While many sports commentators and fans continued to ridicule the league, Warner&#x27;s story gave the league positive exposure, and it brought the league a new television deal with TNN, which, unlike ESPN, televised regular season games live. While it was not financially lucrative, it helped set the stage for what the league would become in the new millennium. The year also brought a spin-off league, the af2, intended to be a developmental league, comparable to the National Football League&#x27;s NFL Europe. There was a lot of expansion in the 2000s. Expansion teams included the Austin Wranglers, Carolina Cobras, Los Angeles Avengers, Chicago Rush, Detroit Fury, Dallas Desperados, Colorado Crush, New Orleans VooDoo, Philadelphia Soul, Nashville Kats, Kansas City Brigade, New York Dragons and Utah Blaze. Some of these teams, including the Crush, Desperados, Kats, and VooDoo, were owned for at least part of their existence by the same group which owned the NFL teams in their host cities, after NFL resolution to allow league owners to own the individual AFL clubs. Also, on February 8, 1999, the NFL purchased, but never exercised, an option to buy a major interest in the AFL (49.9%). Of all of these teams, only the Philadelphia Soul were still playing in the AFL in their last season before folding.
In 2003, the season expanded to 16 games. There were also several rule changes in this period. In 2005, players were no longer allowed to run out of bounds. The only way for a player to go out of bounds presently is if he is tackled into or deliberately contacts the side boards. This was also the first year the ArenaBowl was played at a neutral site. In 2007, free substitution was allowed, ending the &quot;iron man&quot; era of one-platoon football; also, games ending in ties were abolished. The next season, in 2008, the &quot;jack&quot; linebacker was allowed to go sideboard to sideboard without being penalized for &quot;illegal defense&quot;.

===Decline (2008–2009)===
After 12 years as commissioner of the AFL, David Baker retired unexpectedly on July 25, 2008, just two days before ArenaBowl XXII; deputy commissioner Ed Policy was named interim commissioner until Baker&#x27;s replacement was found. Baker explained, &quot;When I took over as commissioner, I thought it would be for one year. It turned into 12. But now it&#x27;s time.&quot;

In October 2008, Tom Benson announced that the New Orleans VooDoo were ceasing operations and folding &quot;based on circumstances currently affecting the league and the team&quot;. Shortly thereafter, an article in &quot;Sports Business Journal&quot; announced that the AFL had a tentative agreement to sell a $100 million stake in the league to Platinum Equity; in exchange, Platinum Equity would create a centralized, single-entity business model that would streamline league and team operations and allow the league to be more profitable. Benson&#x27;s move to shut down the VooDoo came during the Platinum Equity conference call, leading to speculation that he had folded because of the deal.

Because of the sudden loss of the New Orleans franchise, the league announced in October that the beginning of the free agency period would be delayed in order to accommodate a dispersal draft. Dates were eventually announced as December 2 for the dispersal draft and December 4 for free agency, but shortly before the draft the league issued a press release announcing the draft had been postponed one day to December 3. Shortly thereafter, another press release announced that the draft would be held on December 9 and free agency would commence on December 11. However, the draft still never took place, and instead another press release was issued stating that both the draft and free agency had been postponed indefinitely. Rumors began circulating that the league was in trouble and on the verge of folding, but owners denied those claims. It was soon revealed the players&#x27; union had agreed to cut the salary cap for the 2009 season to prevent a total cessation of operations. However, the announced Platinum Equity investment never materialized.

===Canceled 2009 season/first bankruptcy===
Although the af2 played its tenth season in 2009, a conference call in December 2008 resulted in enough votes from owners and cooperation from the AFLPA for the AFL to suspend the entire 2009 season in order to create &quot;a long-term plan to improve its economic model.&quot; In doing so, the AFL became the second sports league to cancel an entire season, after the National Hockey League cancelled the 2004–05 season because of a lockout. The AFL also became the third sports league to lose its postseason (the first being Major League Baseball, which lost its postseason in 1994 because of a strike). Efforts to reformat the league&#x27;s business model were placed under the leadership of Columbus Destroyers owner Jim Renacci and interim commissioner Policy.

High hopes for the AFL waned when interim commissioner Ed Policy announced his resignation, citing the obsolescence of his position in the reformatted league. Two weeks later, the Los Angeles Avengers announced that they were formally folding the franchise. One month later, the league missed the deadline to formally ratify the new collective bargaining agreement and announced that it was eliminating health insurance for the players. Progress on the return stalled, and no announcements were made regarding the future of the league.

On July 20, 2009, &quot;Sports Business Journal&quot; reported that the AFL owed approximately $14 million to its creditors and was considering filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. In early August 2009, numerous media outlets began reporting that the AFL was folding permanently and would file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The league released a statement on August 4 to the effect that while the league was not folding, it was suspending league operations indefinitely. Despite this, several of the league&#x27;s creditors filed papers to force a Chapter 7 liquidation if the league did not do so voluntarily. This request was granted on August 7, though converted to a Chapter 11 reorganization on August 26.

===Relaunch and rock star owners (2010–2014)===
Following the suspension of the AFL&#x27;s 2009 season, league officials and owners of af2 (which had played its season as scheduled) began discussing the future of arena football and the two leagues. With its 50.1 percent ownership of af2, the AFL&#x27;s bankruptcy and dissolution prompted the dissolution of af2 as well. That league was formally considered disbanded on September 8, 2009, when no owner committed his or her team to the league&#x27;s eleventh season by that deadline. For legal reasons, af2 league officials and owners agreed to form a new legal entity, Arena Football 1 (AF1), with former AFL teams the Arizona Rattlers and Orlando Predators joining the former af2.

All assets of the Arena Football League were put up for auction. On November 11, 2009, the new league announced its intention to purchase the entire assets of the former AFL; the assets included the team names and logos of all but one of the former AFL and af2 teams. The lone exception was that of the Dallas Desperados; Desperados owner Jerry Jones had purposely designed the Desperados&#x27; properties around those of the Dallas Cowboys, making the two inseparable. The auction occurred on November 25, 2009. The assets were awarded to Arena Football 1 on December 7, 2009, with a winning bid of $6.1 million.

On February 17, 2010, AF1 announced it would use the &quot;Arena Football League&quot; name. The league announced plans for the upcoming season and details of its contract with NFL Network to broadcast AFL games in 2010. AF1 teams were given the option of restoring historical names to their teams. In addition to the historical teams, the league added two new expansion franchises, the Dallas Vigilantes and the Jacksonville Sharks.

For the 2011 season, the Philadelphia Soul, Kansas City Brigade, San Jose SaberCats, New Orleans VooDoo, and the Georgia Force returned to the AFL after having last played in 2008. However, the Grand Rapids Rampage, Colorado Crush, Columbus Destroyers, Los Angeles Avengers, and the New York Dragons did not return. The league added one expansion team, the Pittsburgh Power. Former Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Lynn Swann was one of the team&#x27;s owners. It was the first time the AFL returned to Pittsburgh since the Pittsburgh Gladiators were an original franchise in 1987 before becoming the Tampa Bay Storm. The Brigade changed its name to the Command, becoming the Kansas City Command. Even though they were returning teams, the former af2 Bossier–Shreveport Battle Wings moved to New Orleans as the Voodoo, the identity formerly owned by New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson. The former af2 Alabama Vipers moved to Duluth, Georgia, to become the new Georgia Force (the earlier franchise of that name having been a continuation of the first Nashville Kats franchise). On October 25, 2010, lt was announced that the Oklahoma City Yard Dawgz would not return. The Milwaukee Iron also changed names to the Milwaukee Mustangs, the name of Milwaukee&#x27;s original AFL team that had existed from 1994 to 2001.
In 2012, the AFL celebrated its silver anniversary for its 25th season of operations. The season kicked off on March 9, 2012. The Tulsa Talons moved to San Antonio, Texas, and Jeffrey Vinik became owner of the Tampa Bay Storm. The Dallas Vigilantes were left off the schedule for the 2012 season with no announcement from the management, and the team was subsequently quietly folded with no formal announcement ever being released. The AFL postponed the free agency period to October 31 due to Hurricane Sandy, noting that the National Football League was simultaneously doing the same thing with regard to its trade deadline.

It was announced on December 12, 2012, that the AFL had reached a partnership agreement with NET10 Wireless to be the first non-motorsports-related professional sports league in the United States to have a title sponsor, renaming it the NET10 Wireless Arena Football League. The redesigned website showed the new logo which incorporated the current AFL logo with the one from NET10 Wireless. The title sponsorship agreement ended in 2014 after a two-year partnership.

In 2013, the league expanded with the addition of two new franchises to play in 2014, the Los Angeles Kiss, owned by Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley of the rock band Kiss, and the Portland Thunder.

In 2014, the league announced the granting of a new franchise to Mötley Crüe frontman Vince Neil, previously part-owner of the Jacksonville Sharks. That franchise, the Las Vegas Outlaws, played their home games at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center, previously home to the Las Vegas Sting and Las Vegas Gladiators. After 20 years as a familiar name to the league, an AFL mainstay, the Iowa Barnstormers, departed the league to join the Indoor Football League. The San Antonio Talons folded on October 13, 2014, after the league (which owned the team) failed to find a new owner. On November 16, 2014, despite a successful season record-wise, the Pittsburgh Power became the second team to cease operations after the 2014 season. This resulted from poor attendance. It was later announced by the league that the Power would go dormant for 2015 and were looking for new ownership. No new ownership group ever materialized, however.

===Contraction (2015–2017)===
Jerry Kurz also stepped down as commissioner of the AFL as he was promoted to be the AFL&#x27;s first president. Former Foxwoods CEO Scott Butera was hired as his successor as commissioner.

On August 9, 2015, ESPN reported that the New Orleans VooDoo and Las Vegas Outlaws had ceased operations. On September 1, 2015, the Spokane Shock officially left the AFL and joined the IFL under the new name Spokane Empire, becoming the fifth active AFL/af2 franchise to leave for the IFL since the 2009 AFL bankruptcy (Iowa Barnstormers, Tri-Cities Fever, Green Bay Blizzard, and Arkansas Twisters left previously).

On November 12, the league announced the defending champion San Jose SaberCats would be ceasing operations due to &quot;reasons unrelated to league operations&quot;. A statement from the league indicated that the AFL was working to secure new, long-term owners for the franchise. This left the AFL with eight teams for 2016.

On January 6, 2016, the league took over &quot;ownership and operational control&quot; of the Portland Thunder from its previous owners. The AFL stated this move was made after months of trying to work out an arrangement &quot;to provide financial and operational support.&quot; On February 3, 2016, it was announced that the franchise would start from scratch and no longer be called the &quot;Thunder&quot; as the name and trademarks belong to former franchise owner Terry Emmert (similar to the Jerry Jones move with the Desperados). AFL commissioner Scott Butera announced that a new identity would be announced at a later date. On February 24, 2016, the Thunder were rebranded as the Portland Steel.

The league&#x27;s 2016 schedule, announced on the league&#x27;s website on December 10, 2015, showed an eight-team league playing a 16-game regular season over 18 weeks, with two bye weeks for each team, one on a rotational basis and the other a &quot;universal bye&quot; for all teams during the Independence Day weekend, the first weekend in July. All teams qualified for the postseason, meaning that the regular season served only to establish seeding.

On February 10, 2016, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and radio station WTOP-FM first broke the story that Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment (Ted Leonsis, chairman), which also owns the NHL&#x27;s Washington Capitals, NBA&#x27;s Washington Wizards, and WNBA&#x27;s Washington Mystics, were &quot;close to a deal&quot; to bring a new expansion franchise to the Verizon Center. On March 10, 2016, AFL commissioner Scott Butera announced that the deal was finalized and that the new Washington, D.C., team would begin play in 2017. On July 14, 2016, the team name was revealed as the Washington Valor. There was also talk for franchises to return to San Antonio and St. Louis as well as a potential new team for Sacramento. However, when the 2017 schedule was announced, there was no mention of any San Antonio, St. Louis, or Sacramento teams.

On October 12, 2016, both the Orlando Predators and Jacksonville Sharks announced their departure from the league, with Jacksonville establishing the National Arena League and the Predators, after a period of dormancy, being reclaimed by some of its former players and also joining the NAL in 2019. The next day, it was reported that the Arizona Rattlers were in the planning stages to also leave the AFL for the Indoor Football League for 2017. In the same report, it was stated the Los Angeles Kiss and Portland Steel had apparently folded after both teams failed to return calls or respond to inquiries into 2017 season ticket purchases. Later on October 13, the league held a teleconference with the remaining team owners and issued a statement the next morning declaring that the league would continue in the long-term, although the league did not expressly commit to playing in 2017 at that time. On October 14, the AFL held a dispersal draft with the five teams selecting players from the Jacksonville, Los Angeles, Orlando, and Portland rosters. The Rattlers then officially left the AFL for the IFL on October 17, leaving the AFL with four teams. They were the sixth AFL team to leave for the IFL since the 2010 relaunch. On November 14, the AFL announced that it had granted a second franchise to Washington Valor owner Ted Leonsis to be based out of Baltimore for the 2017 season, the Baltimore Brigade, bringing the league up to five teams.

On August 23, 2017, the week of ArenaBowl XXX, multiple sources revealed that the AFL planned to expand to Albany, New York, and Newark, New Jersey, for 2018. The Albany Empire was confirmed October 24, with the team owned by Hearst Communications executive George Randolph Hearst III and sharing non-football management with the Philadelphia Soul. There was never another mention of a Newark team in the offseason. On November 28, the Cleveland Gladiators announced that they would have to take a two-year leave of absence while their arena, shared with its primary tenant the NBA&#x27;s Cleveland Cavaliers, was undergoing construction during the basketball offseason. The next month, the longest-tenured AFL team, with franchise roots to the inaugural AFL season, the Tampa Bay Storm, also suspended operations citing financial problems.

===Reorganization and second bankruptcy (2018–2019)===
 In February 2018, the 2018 season schedule was finalized with only the four remaining teams, matching the size of the league in the original &quot;demonstration season&quot; in 1987. However, the collective bargaining agreement (CBA) between the AFL and Arena Football League Players&#x27; Union (AFLPU) had expired after the 2017 season. A new agreement had not been made despite several proposals and supposed ultimatums between the two parties leading to rumors that the season and league&#x27;s existence were in jeopardy. On March 16, 2018, a new deal on a four-year CBA was reached, nearly doubling player compensation and granting expanded health insurance benefits.

On March 27, 2018, the AFL announced that commissioner Scott Butera would be replaced by former AOL counsel Randall Boe prior to the 2018 season. The AFL also partnered with DraftKings to bring back AFL Fantasy Football. The league continued organizational changes for the 2019 season with Philadelphia Soul owner Ron Jaworski taking over as chairman of the executive committee, moving the league&#x27;s headquarters from Las Vegas to Philadelphia, and naming John Adams as president and chief operating officer.

On December 27, 2018, the AFL introduced a new set of logos to be used beginning with the 2019 season. The league announced an expansion team in Atlantic City, New Jersey, on January 22, 2019, that was to be operated by the same ownership group as the Albany Empire. On February 7, 2019, the league re-added the Columbus Destroyers as another expansion team to bring the league back to six teams. On May 3, 2019, the AFL and ESPN Inc. announced a new media rights agreement to broadcast all games on ESPN3 with ArenaBowl XXXII to be broadcast on ESPN2.

After the season, league commissioner Boe announced the closure of all six of the league&#x27;s teams. The closure came as the league re-evaluated its business model and worked to respond to a lawsuit filed against the league by its former worker&#x27;s compensation insurance provider. Boe also stated that they had not made the decision to suspend operations for the entire league at that time (raising the possibility that if the league did return, it would do so under a touring model similar to the Premier Lacrosse League or basketball&#x27;s BIG3) and that a decision on the league&#x27;s future would most likely be announced near the end of 2019.

Approximately a month after the announcement of the closure of teams, on November 27, 2019, commissioner Boe announced via the league&#x27;s Twitter account that the league would be filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and fully cease operations, citing a lack of capital and unresolved liabilities.

=== Third incarnation (2024) ===

On February 1, 2023, G6 Sports Group (based in Toronto, Ontario), a new ownership group that had acquired the league&#x27;s trademarks and social media accounts, announced another revival of the league which began play in 2024. This league is not directly related to the previous league. The league lasted one season before all of its remaining teams left to form Arena Football One prior to 2025.

==Teams==
===Franchises active at the time of the 2019 bankruptcy===
==Season format and ArenaBowl==
The second iteration&#x27;s final season consisted of a 13-week schedule during which each team played 12 games and had one bye week. Each of the six teams played each opponent at least once. At the end of the regular season, the top four teams participated in the ArenaBowl playoffs, in which the top seed faced the 4th seed while the 2nd seed faced the 3rd seed in a home and home series. The team in each series with the higher aggregate score advanced to the ArenaBowl. While the semifinals had two games for each pair of teams, the ArenaBowl was still one game.

From the league&#x27;s inception through ArenaBowl XVIII, the championship game was played at the home of the higher-seeded remaining team. The AFL then switched to a neutral-site championship, with ArenaBowls XIX and XX in Las Vegas. New Orleans Arena, home of the New Orleans VooDoo, served as the site of ArenaBowl XXI on July 29, 2007. This was the first professional sports championship to be staged in the city since Hurricane Katrina struck in August 2005. ArenaBowl XXI in New Orleans was deemed a success, and the city was chosen to host ArenaBowl XXII. In 2010, the location returned to being decided by which of the two participating teams was seeded higher. ArenaBowl XXV () returned to a neutral site and was once again played in New Orleans. From to and , the ArenaBowl was played at the venue of the higher-seeded team, thus reverting to the original format. With one week remaining in the 2018 season, it was announced that the ArenaBowl would be awarded to the semifinal winner with the higher regular season average attendance. This rule was then not used in 2018 after the Washington Valor&#x27;s home field, Capital One Arena, already had scheduled renovations starting at the end of the Valor&#x27;s season; the championship would then be played in Baltimore despite the Valor&#x27;s higher attendance. In 2019, the ArenaBowl was hosted by the higher seed.

==Rules==

* The field: An indoor padded surface wide and long with end zones. Goal posts are wide with a crossbar height of (NFL goalposts are wide with the crossbar at ). The goalside rebound nets are wide by high. Any ball bouncing off of the nets, whether thrown or kicked, prior to contacting the ground, is live, as are balls off of the nets&#x27; supporting systems. The bottom of the nets are above the ground. Sideline barriers are high and made of high density foam rubber.
* Equipment: the official football is the same size and weight as a National Football League ball, but with proprietary Arena Football insignia.
* Players and formations: eight players on the field; 21-man active roster; four-man inactive roster
* Substitutions: free substitution; some players may play both ways either by coach&#x27;s choice or to step in because of injury. (The free substitution rule was adopted in 2007; prior to this, the AFL mandated a one-platoon system, from which two players on each side of the ball, the &quot;specialists&quot; and the quarterback or kicker, were exempt.)
* Formation: four offensive players, including a wide receiver, must line up on the line of scrimmage. Of the three interior linemen, one must raise his hand indicating that he is an eligible receiver and hence a tight end, the other lineman being considered a guard. Three defensive players must be down linemen (in a three or four-point stance). Only the &quot;Mac&quot; linebacker may blitz on either side of the center. The &quot;Jack&quot; linebacker is restricted in where he can go prior to the ball crossing the line of scrimmage. Alignment is two or more yards off the line of scrimmage. No stunting or twisting. Offensive motion in the backfield: one receiver may go in a forward motion before the snap.
* Timing: four 15 minute quarters with a 15-minute halftime (in the ArenaBowl, 30 minutes). The clock stops for out-of-bounds plays and incomplete passes only in the last half-minute of regulation and overtime and when the referee deems it necessary for penalties, injuries or timeouts. Except in the last half-minute of regulation, the clock continues to run after a touchdown is scored until the extra-point conversion has been attempted. Each team is allowed three timeouts per half, and two per overtime period if regulation ends tied; as in the NFL, any injury in last half-minute of regulation or overtime costs that player&#x27;s team a timeout (exception applies to when team has no timeouts, and their player is injured, they&#x27;re allowed a 4th timeout). Before 2018, the league had clock stoppage rules for the final minute of each half that now are only implemented in the final half-minute of regulation and overtime. Also, prior to 2018 a team with the lead and possession of the ball in the last minute had to gain positive yards on a play from scrimmage or the clock was stopped until the next snap, effectively outlawing the &quot;victory formation&quot;. The play clock is 30 seconds.
* Movement of the ball and scoring: four downs are allowed to advance the ball ten yards for a first down, or to score. Six points for a touchdown. One point for a conversion by place kick after a touchdown or if a safety is scored off any conversion attempt, two points for a conversion by drop kick or for successful run or pass after a touchdown. Three points for a field goal by placement or fair catch kick or four points for a field goal by drop kick. Two points for a safety and for a defensive turnover on a conversion attempt returned the length of the field (a play which would be a defensive touchdown under any circumstances other than its occurring during a conversion attempt).
* Kicking: kickoffs are from the goal line, to begin the halves and odd overtimes, or after any score. Kickers may use a one-inch tee. All kicks must be made by either place kick or drop kick; punting is prohibited. The receiving team may field any kick that rebounds off the net or its surrounding framework and lands in the field of play. Any kickoff that goes out of bounds untouched or hits an overhead structure is to be placed at the 20-yard line or the place where it went out of bounds, whichever is more advantageous to the receiving team. If a kickoff goes beyond the end zone and stays in bounds (such as kicking it into the field goal &quot;slack net&quot; or if the ball goes under the net), the ball will come out to the five-yard line. The touchback is not automatic; players must attempt to advance the ball out of their own end zone if it is caught there. The same is true if a missed field goal attempt goes beyond the goal line but is short of the rebound net. If the receiving player chooses not to take the ball out of the end zone (takes a knee) or is tackled in the end zone, the ball is placed on the 2½-yard line (the attempted runback does not result in a safety unless the runner crosses the goal line onto the field of play and then retreats into the end zone under his own impetus and is tackled there). Any field goal or extra point attempted by drop kick is worth one additional point (thus four points for a drop-kicked field goal or two for drop-kicked conversion). 
* Passing: passing rules in arena football are the same as outdoor NCAA football in which receivers must have one foot inbounds. A unique exception involves the rebound nets. A forward pass that rebounds off the end zone net is a live ball and is in play until it touches the playing surface, as is a ball which bounces off of the padding of the sideline boards, provided it has not been touched by a member of the crowd. A player who goes over the boards to catch a ball and maintains possession of the ball to the floor is awarded a catch even if he lands out of bounds.
* Overtime: overtime periods are now 15 minutes during the regular season and the playoffs. In the first overtime each team gets one possession to score, unless the first team to possess yields a defensive touchdown or a safety, either of which ends the game immediately. Whoever is ahead after one possession for each team wins. If the teams are tied after each has had a possession, whoever scores next by any means wins. Multiple overtime periods will be played if needed in case of a tie and play continues in true sudden death thereafter for both regular-season and postseason games. 
* Coaching challenges: Coaches are allowed two challenges per game; to do so, they must throw the red challenge flag before the next play. If the play stands as called after the play is reviewed, the team loses a timeout; however, if it is reversed they keep their timeout. If a team wins two straight challenges they are granted a third. In lieu of coaching challenges, reviews are automatic in the final half-minute of regulation and in all overtime periods, as they are for all scoring plays and all turnovers.
* Offsides: Defensive players may not jump offsides twice in any half; they risk ejection for the rest of the half if they do (this penalty is enforced in addition to the yardage penalty). Defensive players called for jumping offsides in overtime risk disqualification.
* Targeting, such as using the helmet to ram another player is prohibited, and players who do so risk immediate disqualification, plus a 15-yard penalty.
* Like the NCAA, CFL, and NFL, players are warned once for their first unsportsmanlike conduct penalty, and if they pick up another, they risk immediate disqualification. Flagrant fouls involving non-football violent acts or flagrantly unsportsmanlike conduct result in immediate disqualification.

==Growth of the league==

===Season format changes===
The practice of playing one or two preseason exhibition games by each team before the start of the regular season was discontinued when the NBC contract was initiated, and the regular season was extended from 14 games during the 1996 to 2000 seasons to 16 from 2001 to 2010. From 2011 to 2015, the regular season league expanded to 18 games, with each team having two bye weeks and the option of two preseason games. Since the 2015 season and the decreasing league membership, the season length also decreased, first to 16 games in 2016, then to 14 games in 2017, and 12 games in 2018.

===China Arena Football League and AFL Global===

In August 2012, Ganlan Media International received exclusive rights from the AFL to establish a new Chinese arena football league. The league was eventually named the China Arena Football League (CAFL). The CAFL project is headed up by Martin E. Judge Jr. and Ron Jaworski, who were both part of the Philadelphia Soul&#x27;s ownership group. The original plans were to establish a six-team league that would play a 10-week schedule that was slated to start in October 2014. The AFL coaches and trainers were to travel to China to help teach the rules of the sport to squads made up of Chinese and American players with the goal of starting an official Chinese arena league. Following delays, the league began its first full season in 2016; however, subsequent play was postponed until a heavily abbreviated tournament was played in 2019.

The CAFL is not directly affiliated with the AFL and is instead owned by AFL Global, LLC, an entity that was created by Martin E. Judge Jr.

==Hall of Fame==

The AFL had its own Hall of Fame consisting of players, coaches, and contributors who have significantly impacted the league. The AFL Hall of Fame solely existed to honor various AFL affiliates. This was the highest honor for any personnel who have been involved with the AFL. It had no physical location and existed solely as a list of players and contributors maintained by the league itself.

The Arena Football Hall of Fame was not affiliated with the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

===Former AFL contributors in the Pro Football Hall of Fame===
*Kurt Warner, quarterback, Iowa Barnstormers, 1995–1997, inducted in the Class of 2017
*Pat Bowlen, owner, Colorado Crush, 2003–2008, inducted in the Class of 2019 (Bowlen&#x27;s business partner in the Crush, John Elway, was inducted into the Hall as a player in 2004)
*Joe DeLamielleure, offensive lineman/defensive lineman, Charlotte Rage, 1992, inducted in the Class of 2003 (note that DeLamielleure&#x27;s time in the AFL was largely a publicity stunt and that DeLamielleure saw only limited action in two games)

==Media==

===Television===
====2000s====
In 2000 the AFL had a television deal with TNN, ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC worth more than $25 million. Beginning with the 2003 season, the AFL made a deal with NBC to televise league games, which was renewed for another two years in 2005. In conjunction with this, the league moved the beginning of the season from May to February (the week after the NFL&#x27;s Super Bowl) and scheduled most of its games on Sunday instead of Friday or Saturday as it had in the past. In 2006, because of the XX Winter Olympic Games, the Stanley Cup playoffs and the Daytona 500, NBC scaled back from weekly coverage to scattered coverage during the regular season, but committed to a full playoff schedule ending with the 20th ArenaBowl. NBC and the Arena Football League officially severed ties on June 30, 2006, having failed to reach a new broadcast deal. Las Vegas owner Jim Ferraro stated during a radio interview that the reason efforts to make a deal failed was that ESPN refused to show highlights or scores or even mention Arena football as long as it was being aired on NBC.

For the 2006 season only, the AFL added a national cable deal with OLN (later the now-defunct NBC Sports Network) for eleven regular-season games and one playoff game.

On December 19, 2006, ESPN announced the purchase of a minority stake in the AFL. This deal included television rights for the ESPN family of networks. ESPN would televise a minimum of 17 regular season games, most on Monday nights, and nine playoff games, including ArenaBowl XXI on ABC. The deal resulted in added exposure on ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot;. However, after the original AFL filed for bankruptcy, this arrangement did not carry over to the new AFL, which was a separate legal entity. The AFL also had a regional-cable deal with FSN, where FSN regional affiliates in AFL markets carried local team games.

====2010s====
After its return in 2010, the AFL had its national television deal with the NFL Network for a weekly Friday night game. All AFL games not on the NFL Network could be seen for free online, provided by Ustream.

The NFL Network ceased airing live Arena Football League games partway through the 2012 season as a result of ongoing labor problems within the league. Briefly, the games were broadcast on a tape delay to prevent the embarrassment that would result should the players stage a work stoppage immediately prior to a scheduled broadcast. (In at least once incidence this actually happened, resulting in a non-competitive game being played with replacement players, and further such incidents were threatened.) Once the labor issues were resolved, the NFL Network resumed the practice of broadcasting a live Friday night game. NFL Network dropped the league at the end of the 2012 season.

For the 2013 season, the league&#x27;s new national broadcast partner was the CBS Sports Network. CBSSN would air 19 regular season games and two playoff games. CBS would also air the ArenaBowl, marking the first time since 2008 that the league&#x27;s finale aired on network television. Regular season CBSSN broadcast games were usually on Saturday nights. As the games were shown live, the start times were not uniform as with most football broadcast packages, but varied with the time zone in which the home team was located. This meant that the AFL may have appeared either prior to or following the CBSSN&#x27;s featured Major League Lacrosse game.

In 2014, ESPN returned to the AFL as broadcast partners, with weekly games being shown on CBS Sports Network, ESPN, ESPN2 and ESPNEWS along with all games being broadcast on ESPN3 for free live on WatchESPN and the ESPN app. ArenaBowl XXVII and XXVIII were also broadcast on ESPN. Most teams also had a local TV station broadcast their games locally and all games were available on local radio. In 2016, Univision Deportes began airing select AFL games during the regular season. For the 2017 season, one AFL game per week was broadcast live nationally over CBS Sports Network. In 2017, the AFL also began streaming some games on Twitter and AFLNow, the league&#x27;s streaming service. For the 2018 season, the AFL&#x27;s sole national English language telecast partner was the CBS Sports Network, but all games were streamed free online and Brigade and Valor games were available over their owner Ted Leonsis&#x27; Monumental Sports Network. In 2019, all games were available via streaming on ESPN3, except for ArenaBowl 32, which was aired over ESPN2.

===Video games===

The first video game based on the AFL was &quot;Arena Football&quot; for the C-64 released in 1988. On May 18, 2000, &quot;Kurt Warner&#x27;s Arena Football Unleashed&quot; was released by Midway Games for the PlayStation game console. On February 7, 2006, EA Sports released &quot;Arena Football&quot; for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox. EA Sports released another AFL video game, titled &quot;Arena Football: Road to Glory&quot;, on February 21, 2007, for the PlayStation 2.

===Literature===
In 2001, Jeff Foley published &quot;War on the Floor: An Average Guy Plays in the Arena Football League and Lives to Write About It&quot;. The book details a journalist&#x27;s two preseasons (1999 and 2000) as an offensive specialist/writer with the now-defunct Albany Firebirds. The 5-foot-6 (170 cm), self-described &quot;unathletic writer&quot; played in three preseason games and had one catch for −2 yards.

==League finances==
For its second iteration from 2010 to 2019, the AFL ran under a single-entity model, with the league owning the rights to the teams, players, and coaches. The single-entity model was adopted in 2010 when the league emerged from bankruptcy. Prior to that, the league followed the franchise model more common in North American professional sports leagues; each team essentially operated as its own business with different owners and the league itself was a separate entity which in exchange for franchise fees paid by the team owners provided rules, officials, scheduling and the other elements of organizational structure, while a pool of money was allotted to teams to aid in travel costs. Expansion fees increased from $250,000 in 1993 to $16.2 million by 2003. In 2005 the Kansas City Brigade owners paid an $18 million franchise fee, a league record.

In 2019, at the time the AFL filed for bankruptcy, it was operated on a $20 million budget.

===Players compensation===
For most of the 1990s, the average annual salary for an arena football player was around $22,000 plus additional bonuses for victories and postseason awards, without injury benefits. In 2000, a group of players filed a class-action antitrust suit against the AFL claiming &quot;price-fixed salaries&quot; by league teams and requesting injury compensation, which led to the league owners threatening to cancel the upcoming season, and requested to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) in order to elude United States antitrust laws. To avoid season cancellation, a new group called the &quot;Arena Football League Players&#x27; Organizing Committee&quot; (which later became the &quot;Arena Football League Players Association&quot;) was formed, which represented the majority of AFL players, and negotiated the AFL&#x27;s first CBA with league owners as the acting labor union. The union negotiated reduced free agent eligibility (from eight years to four), year-round health care for players and their immediate families, improved safety measures (including replacement of playing fields), raising the average player&#x27;s salary to $35,000 (and average team payroll to $700,000 from $540,000 in 1999 season) and a 401(k) retirement plan, in exchange for a &quot;hard&quot; salary cap of $1,375,000 per team for the 2001 season (but with a salary cap exception for &quot;Franchise Players&quot;), which included player salaries, win bonuses, player health and insurance coverage and a player housing allowance.

In 2003, the league agreed to &quot;freeze&quot; the salary cap in a new CBA at $1,643,000 for 2003 season, with increases for the following years: $1,684,075 (2004), $1,743,018 (2005), $1,821,453 (2006), $1,921,633 (2007), $2,036,931 (2008), $2,179,517 (2009) and $2,332,083 (2010). The CBA also stated that the owners would not be able to lower the cap until the agreement expires. Players were also eligible for housing stipend if they resided year-round within 75 miles of the team&#x27;s home arena. By 2009, the league minimum salary was $31,000 and $80,000 on average ($125,000 for quarterbacks), while the highest-paid player was Tony Graziani, with a salary of over $200,000, including bonuses.

The increased salaries were a major factor in the decision to go dormant for the 2009 season, after failed attempts by the owners to cancel the CBA, as several teams reported losing $2 million a year. It was believed that they were hoping for a plan similar to one used by the af2, which operated as a single-tax entity, or launching a new 11-man outdoor development league called the United National Gridiron League to replace the recently defunct NFL Europe. When the af2 took over as the new AFL and relaunched in 2010, players were paid $400 per game, similar to the af2. Three players on each team were eligible for designation as a &quot;franchise&quot; player, and received a salary of $1,000 per game. The league also offered financial aid for housing and meal expenses.

In 2012, the players formed a new union called the &quot;Arena Football League Players Union&quot; (AFLPU), and signed a new CBA that stated that all players would be paid equally: $830 per game for a &quot;veteran&quot; player and $775 for &quot;rookies&quot; plus a housing plan and three meals a day, with quarterbacks earning an extra $250 per start. The salary would increase gradually to $925 and $870 (respectively) until 2017, the last year of the CBA. In the last CBA, a new salary cap was put in place ($438,480) with a salary &quot;floor&quot; of $340,000 for a 14-game season, and a $501,120 cap with a $388,576 floor for a 16-game season. Players signed one-year contracts, as veteran &quot;compensation range&quot; was $1,100–1,455 per game, while rookies earned between $650 and $1,000 a game. In addition, player could earn up to $1,000 every year for local business appearances, while per-diem allowance were $41-a-day. In case of a mid-season trade players would have got $500 for moving costs.

===Accusation of mismanagement and unpaid bills===
In the late 2010s the AFL&#x27;s entity ownership, Arena Football One, LLC, had been at the center of much controversy over mismanagement of franchises, unpaid bills and several lawsuits against them.

====Jerry Kurz lawsuit====
On July 21, 2016, league co-founder, former commissioner and president Jerry Kurz filed a class action lawsuit against Arena Football One, LLC, and his successor as commissioner, Scott Butera, for what was deemed &quot;breach of contract&quot; after his effective demotion and subsequent firing following the 2015 season. In August 2018, that lawsuit was dismissed, a new action was filed and ultimately settled. Kurz left for the IFL as Director of Business Development.

=== Partnerships ===
==League progression==

Average attendance for AFL games were around 10,000–11,000 per game in the 1990s, though during the recession connected to the dot-com bubble and the September 11 attacks average attendance dropped below 10,000 for several years. From the start of the 2004 season until the final season of the original league in 2008, average attendance was above 12,000, with 12,392 in 2007. Eleven of the seventeen teams in operation in 2007 had average attendance figures over 13,000. In 2008, the overall attendance average increased to 12,957 (the highest count achieved by the league), with eight teams exceeding 13,000 per game.

In 2010, the first year of the reconstituted league following bankruptcy, the overall attendance average decreased to 8,135, with only one team (Tampa Bay) exceeding 13,000 per game. The 2019 average per game attendance of 7,195 was the second-lowest attendance average in league history, only exceeded by 1989&#x27;s per-game average of 5,705.

<text>The AF2 (often styled as af2, and short for arenafootball2) was the Arena Football League&#x27;s developmental league; it was founded in 1999 and played its first season in 2000. Like its parent AFL, the AF2 played using the same arena football rules and style of play. League seasons ran from April through July with the postseason and ArenaCup championship in August. The AF2 continued to operate while the AFL suspended operations for its 2009 season. The league was effectively disbanded in September 2009 when no team committed to playing in 2010, but several of the stronger franchises transferred into the reconstituted AFL.

Like most other minor sports leagues, the AF2 existed to develop football players and also to help players adapt to the style and pace of arena football. In addition, the AF2 was similar to other minor leagues because AF2 teams played in smaller cities and smaller venues. While the AFL was played in cities like Los Angeles, New York City, Philadelphia, Dallas, and Chicago, the AF2 fielded teams in cities which are part of metropolitan statistical areas ranging in size from Milwaukee (with 1,739,497 residents) to Albany, Georgia (with 164,000 residents). Also in common with other minor professional sports leagues, players also earned less than in the AFL, with each player making $200-$500 per game, with a minimum $50 victory bonus.

==History==
The AF2 was founded in 1999 by the Arena Football League in an attempt to bring the game to mid-sized markets following the success of AFL on the national level. The AF2 was not intended to be a farm system for the AFL like the American Hockey League and Minor League Baseball are to the National Hockey League and Major League Baseball, respectively. The league was instead designed as a league that would develop the players in the interest of the higher league as a whole. The lack of AFL–AF2 team affiliations would prevent the AFL from &quot;stashing&quot; players in the lower league for later use. Players in the AF2 were signed to one-year contracts, after the expiration of which they essentially became free agents to sign with whichever league and team they would prefer. The 16-week contracts with the individual AF2 teams also prevented players from leaving for the parent league mid-season; this preserved the quality of play in the lower league and did not destroy team dynamics with players coming and going throughout the season as they do in the NHL and MLB.

The foundation of the AF2 was a response to the launch of several small-market indoor football leagues in the mid-to-late 1990s, including the Professional Indoor Football League, Indoor Professional Football League, and Indoor Football League. Each of these leagues, though they would eventually fold, managed to last for multiple seasons, proving that the game had some traction in the smaller cities. With Jim Foster&#x27;s patent on arena football, the AF2 had the advantage of being the same game as was being seen on the national level with the use of the rebound nets. Working on a smaller scale, the AF2 would try to capitalize on local and regional rivalries.
The Xtreme Football League was another upstart league trying to capitalize on the arena football phenomenon. Founded in Birmingham, Alabama, with the intent to begin play in 2000, this XFL (which was not related to the WWE-backed outdoor league) used East Coast Hockey League ownership to keep team costs low while providing established ownership and arenas for play. The cities that were to take part in the Xtreme Football League were: Birmingham, Alabama (Birmingham Steeldogs), Greenville, South Carolina (Carolina Rhinos), Huntsville, Alabama (Tennessee Valley Vipers), Jacksonville, Florida (Jacksonville Tomcats), Norfolk, Virginia (Norfolk Nighthawks), Pensacola, Florida (Pensacola Barracudas), Richmond, Virginia (Richmond Speed), Roanoke, Virginia (Roanoke Steam), and Tallahassee, Florida (Tallahassee Thunder). Although a logo was developed and venues had begun to be lined up, the league and its nine teams were purchased by the AF2 on July 29, 1999, and the Xtreme Football League never played a single game.

The AF2 finally took the field in March 2000 in a game between the Birmingham Steeldogs and Tennessee Valley Vipers (two of the acquired XFL teams). Fifteen teams were fielded in 2000 with the rights for several more cities quickly secured. The Orlando Predators also purchased the competitor Indoor Football League; several teams would be absorbed into the AF2 for the 2001 season.

The first season concluded with over 868,000 people attending AF2 games, averaging over 7,200 per game; several teams ended with average attendances over 10,000 fans. In addition over 9,200 fans attended ArenaCup I between the Tennessee Valley Vipers and Quad City Steamwheelers in Moline, Illinois. Deemed a success, the league returned for a second season and returned all 15 original teams as well as 13 expansion teams.

===Dissolution===
For legal purposes, the league was effectively dissolved on September 8, 2009, when no team submitted the paperwork to return in 2010. Since the original AFL had suspended 2009 operations and later suspended all operations indefinitely after declaring bankruptcy, the minority owners (as the AFL owned 50.1%) of AF2 were wary of being owned by and paying money owed to the bankrupt league&#x27;s creditors.

The remaining teams and Board of Directors of AF2, and some former members of the AFL joined to create a new league, originally called &quot;Arena Football One&quot;, which was announced at a press conference on September 28, 2009. Legally, Arena Football One, later doing business as the Arena Football League, was an entity independent of the original Arena Football League and AF2 and was made up of former AFL and AF2 teams with several new (expansion) teams and one team from another league. After acquiring the assets of the former Arena Football League in a bankruptcy court sale, the new entity formally became the &quot;new&quot; Arena Football League. Unlike the previous Arena Football League and AF2, the new AFL was an entity-model league in which the league owned the individual teams and hired local management groups to operate them, rather than the traditional North American sports league model where each team is a separate business and the league is a non-profit association formed and controlled by the various team owners in order to co-ordinate and govern operations.

===Rumors of a return===
There had been rumors of a possible return of AF2, after Arena Football League commissioner Jerry Kurz had stated a return of the league for 2013, but that did not materialize. Kurz had also mentioned af2 in an interview on The AFL Podcast in 2024. 

==ArenaCup==

The ArenaCup was the AF2&#x27;s championship game, held annually in August. For the league&#x27;s first five years, it was held at the home arena of the higher-seeded remaining team. However, as the old AFL has changed, the AF2 also changed. In the same year that ArenaBowl XIX was played at a neutral site in Las Vegas, ArenaCup VI was the first AF2 championship to be played at a neutral site in Bossier City, Louisiana. The practice continued the following year when ArenaCup VII was played in Coliseo de Puerto Rico in San Juan; the title game returned to Bossier City in ArenaCup VIII. Citing lower attendances at the neutral site ArenaCup games, the league returned to the original arena arrangement for the 2008 season.

With the exception of ArenaCup V, all AF2 championships were televised either nationally or locally. The inaugural and second ArenaCups were broadcast on TNN Motor Sports/TNN Sports, which carried AFL games on Sunday afternoons at the time. However, when the AFL broadcast rights were purchased by NBC, the ArenaCup national telecast was lost. The 2002 ArenaCup was televised by the Vision Network, and ArenaCup IV was televised by KWHB, a local station in Tulsa, Oklahoma. After having no television coverage in 2004, the national telecasts returned to the airwaves with Fox Sports Net in 2005 and Comcast Sports Net in 2006, 2007, and 2008.

ArenaCup IX, as well as the season in its entirety, was broadcast online via NiFTy TV.

==Teams==
The league&#x27;s teams were divided into two conferences, the American and National Conferences. The conferences were further subdivided into three divisions each. Each division represented a region of the country in which teams played. Unlike most sports leagues, the alignment of teams into divisions was not even; in 2009, the Central division featured three teams while the West featured five teams. Teams were placed in divisions based on geographic rivalries to reduce travel costs as teams played division opponents more often than non-divisional opponents. Alignment was subject to change each year as new teams joined the league and others dropped out.

Because of legal issues regarding the bankruptcy and subsequent dissolution of the original Arena Football League, no team committed to continue with arenafootball2 operations. This list is the final alignment of AF2 at the end of the 2009 season.
===League expansion===
In a June 2003 interview with &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, AFL commissioner David Baker briefly mentioned the AF2, saying how one day he envisioned the league growing to 100 teams. The AF2 started off with 15 teams in 2000, then expanded to 28 teams in 2001, and finally to 34 in 2002. The number of teams the league fielded dropped every year from there on after, until the 2006 season; 27 teams were fielded in 2003, 25 in 2004, and 20 in 2005. Finally, in 2006, the AF2 saw its first expansion in four years, fielding 23 teams, and continued that into 2007 with 30 teams.

The drop in teams between 2002 and 2006 could be partially attributed to the league expanding too rapidly in its first three seasons. Many teams were financially unstable and folded. This could have been at least in large measure due to higher expenses, even compared to those of similar leagues. Franchise fees in the league ranged from $600,000 to $1 million. Historically, massive sports league expansions have had little success, either in indoor football or other sports. For instance, the National Indoor Football League, a rival indoor league, saw large numbers of expansion teams after beginning play in 2001 but many struggled financially and played only briefly, incurring considerable financial losses before folding. In more recent years, the American Basketball Association has exhibited the same situation to an even greater degree.

Nine new expansion teams were approved for 2007 in the AF2: the Boise Burn, the Cincinnati Jungle Kats, the Fort Wayne Fusion, the Laredo Lobos, the Lubbock Renegades, the Mahoning Valley Thunder, the Texas Copperheads, the Tri-Cities Fever, and the Corpus Christi Sharks. The Texas, Laredo, and Tri-Cities teams moved to the AF2 from other indoor football leagues. For the 2007 season, the league fielded 30 teams. After the 2007 season, three of those teams folded, the Fort Wayne Fusion, the Cincinnati Jungle Kats, and the Laredo Lobos. The Everett Hawks, Alabama Steeldogs, and the Bakersfield Blitz also ceased operations.

For 2008, the league fielded one team fewer, at 29. Two teams were reactivated: the Iowa Barnstormers and the Peoria Pirates, and the league admitted three new teams that were transferring from other leagues. The Lexington Horsemen came from UIF; the Daytona Beach ThunderBirds, from the WIFL, and the Austin Wranglers moved down from the AFL. After the season, Austin and Daytona Beach folded, along with Louisville, Lubbock, and Texas. The league was expected to expand to Toledo, Ohio and Worcester, Massachusetts by 2011.

===Continuing teams===

When AF2 folded, some teams joined the AF2 Board of Directors in forming the new &quot;Arena Football 1&quot; that soon became the new Arena Football League. Iowa, Milwaukee, Tennessee Valley (which changed its name to Alabama to reflect the state, rather than the region), Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Bossier-Shreveport, and Spokane all moved to the new AFL to join &quot;old&quot; AFL teams Arizona, Orlando, Tampa Bay, Chicago, and Cleveland, along with expansion teams in Dallas and Jacksonville, and the American Indoor Football team in Utah that had also been in the old AFL. Kentucky, Tri-Cities, and Arkansas also committed to the new league, but Kentucky folded, and Tri-Cities and Arkansas followed Green Bay and Amarillo to the Indoor Football League. Albany did not play in 2010 while seeking an expansion into the &quot;new&quot; AFL in 2011, along with a planned addition in Toledo.

By the conclusion of the 2015 AFL Season, none of the seven AF2 franchises that moved into the AFL remained in the league. The Oklahoma City Yard Dawgz ceased operations after the 2010 season. In the 2011 season, the Alabama Vipers relocated to suburban Atlanta and assumed the identity and history of the former Georgia Force before folding after the 2012 season, while the Bossier-Shreveport Battle Wings moved to New Orleans and became a continuation of the VooDoo and then ceased operations after the 2015 season. The Milwaukee Iron rebranded itself in 2011 as the Mustangs, adopting the name of a previous Milwaukee team. Tulsa relocated to San Antonio before the start of the 2012 season, retaining the Talons&#x27; name and history and folded after the 2014 season. Milwaukee suspended operations for the 2013 season, and the team relocated to Portland, Oregon for the 2014 season, becoming the Portland Thunder, later renamed the Steel before ultimately folding after the 2016 AFL season. After the 2014 AFL season, the Iowa Barnstormers changed leagues from the AFL to the Indoor Football League. After the conclusion of the 2015 season, the last AF2 team remaining in the AFL, the Spokane Shock, joined the Barnstormers in the IFL as the Spokane Empire, and then also folded in 2017.

After the conclusion of the 2019 AFL season, the Arena Football League filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and ceased operations in November 2019.

<text>In the United States, a health maintenance organization (HMO) is a medical insurance group that provides health services for a fixed annual fee. It is an organization that provides or arranges managed care for health insurance, self-funded health care benefit plans, individuals, and other entities, acting as a liaison with health care providers (hospitals, doctors, etc.) on a prepaid basis. The US Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973 required employers with 25 or more employees to offer federally certified HMO options if the employer offers traditional healthcare options. Unlike traditional indemnity insurance, an HMO covers care rendered by those doctors and other professionals who have agreed by contract to treat patients in accordance with the HMO&#x27;s guidelines and restrictions in exchange for a steady stream of customers. HMOs cover emergency care regardless of the health care provider&#x27;s contracted status.

== Operation ==
HMOs often require members to select a primary care physician (PCP), a doctor who acts as a gatekeeper to direct access to medical services but this is not always the case. PCPs are usually internists, pediatricians, family doctors, geriatricians, or general practitioners (GPs). Except in medical emergency situations, patients need a referral from the PCP in order to see a specialist or other doctor, and the gatekeeper cannot authorize that referral unless the HMO guidelines deem it necessary. Some HMOs pay gatekeeper PCPs set fees for each defined medical procedure they provide to insured patients (fee-for-service) and then capitate specialists (that is, pay a set fee for each insured person&#x27;s care, irrespective of which medical procedures the specialists performs to achieve that care), while others use the reverse arrangement.

Open-access and point-of-service (POS) products are a combination of an HMO and traditional indemnity plan. The member(s) are not required to use a gatekeeper or obtain a referral before seeing a specialist. In that case, the traditional benefits are applicable. If the member uses a gatekeeper, the HMO benefits are applied. However, the beneficiary cost sharing (e.g., co-payment or coinsurance) may be higher for specialist care. HMOs also manage care through utilization review. That means they monitor doctors to see if they are performing more services for their patients than other doctors, or fewer. HMOs often provide preventive care for a lower copayment or for free, in order to keep members from developing a preventable condition that would require a great deal of medical services. When HMOs were coming into existence, indemnity plans often did not cover preventive services, such as immunizations, well-baby checkups, mammograms, or physicals. It is this inclusion of services intended to maintain a member&#x27;s health that gave the HMO its name. Some services, such as outpatient mental health care, are limited, and more costly forms of care, diagnosis, or treatment may not be covered. Experimental treatments and elective services that are not medically necessary (such as elective plastic surgery) are almost never covered.

Other choices for managing care are case management, in which patients with catastrophic cases are identified, or disease management, in which patients with certain chronic diseases like diabetes, asthma, or some forms of cancer are identified. In either case, the HMO takes a greater level of involvement in the patient&#x27;s care, assigning a case manager to the patient or a group of patients to ensure that no two providers provide overlapping care, and to ensure that the patient is receiving appropriate treatment, so that the condition does not worsen beyond what can be helped.

== Cost containment ==
Although businesses pursued the HMO model for its alleged cost containment benefits, some research indicates that private HMO plans do not achieve any significant cost savings over non-HMO plans. Although out-of-pocket costs are reduced for consumers, controlling for other factors, the plans do not affect total expenditures and payments by insurers. A possible reason for this failure is that consumers might increase utilization in response to less cost sharing under HMOs. Some have asserted that HMOs (especially those run for profit) actually increase administrative costs and tend to cherry-pick healthier patients.

== History ==
Though some forms of group &quot;managed care&quot; did exist prior to the 1970s, in the US they came about chiefly through the influence of President Richard Nixon and his friend Edgar Kaiser. In discussion in the White House on February 17, 1971, Nixon expressed his support for the essential philosophy of the HMO, which John Ehrlichman explained thus: &quot;All the incentives are toward less medical care, because the less care they give them, the more money they make.&quot; 

The earliest form of HMOs can be seen in a number of &quot;prepaid health plans&quot;. In 1910, the Western Clinic in Tacoma, Washington offered lumber mill owners and their employees certain medical services from its providers for a premium of $0.50 per member per month. This is considered by some to be the first example of an HMO. However, Ross-Loos Medical Group, established in 1929, is considered to be the first HMO in the United States; it was headquartered in Los Angeles and initially provided services for Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) and Los Angeles County employees. 200 DWP employees enrolled at a cost of $1.50 each per month. Within a year, the Los Angeles Fire Department signed up, then the Los Angeles Police Department, then the Southern California Telephone Company (now AT&amp;T Inc.), and more. By 1951, enrollment stood at 35,000 and included teachers, county and city employees. In 1982 through the merger of the Insurance Company of North America (INA) founded in 1792 and Connecticut General (CG) founded in 1865 came together to become CIGNA. Also in 1929 Dr. Michael Shadid created a health plan in Elk City, Oklahoma in which farmers bought shares for $50 to raise the money to build a hospital. The medical community did not like this arrangement and threatened to suspend Shadid&#x27;s licence. The Farmer&#x27;s Union took control of the hospital and the health plan in 1934. Also in 1929, Baylor Hospital provided approximately 1,500 teachers with prepaid care. This was the origin of Blue Cross. Around 1939, state medical societies created Blue Shield plans to cover physician services, as Blue Cross covered only hospital services. These prepaid plans burgeoned during the Great Depression as a method for providers to ensure constant and steady revenue.

In 1970, the number of HMOs declined to fewer than 40. Paul M. Ellwood Jr., often called the &quot;father&quot; of the HMO, began having discussions with what is today the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that led to the enactment of the Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973. This act had three main provisions:
* Grants and loans were provided to plan, start, or expand an HMO
* Certain state-imposed restrictions on HMOs were removed if the HMOs were federally certified
* Employers with 25 or more employees were required to offer federally certified HMO options alongside indemnity upon request

This last provision, called the dual choice provision, was the most important, as it gave HMOs access to the critical employer-based market that had often been blocked in the past. The federal government was slow to issue regulations and certify plans until 1977, when HMOs began to grow rapidly. The dual choice provision expired in 1995.

In 1971, Gordon K. MacLeod developed and became the director of the United States&#x27; first federal HMO program. He was recruited by Elliot Richardson, the secretary of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare.

== Types ==
HMOs operate in a variety of forms. Most HMOs today do not fit neatly into one form; they can have multiple divisions, each operating under a different model, or blend two or more models together.
In the staff model, physicians are salaried and have offices in HMO buildings. In this case, physicians are direct employees of the HMOs. This model is an example of a closed-panel HMO, meaning that contracted physicians may only see HMO patients. Previously this type of HMO was common, although currently it is nearly inactive. In the group model, the HMO does not employ the physicians directly, but contracts with a multi-specialty physician group practice. Individual physicians are employed by the group practice, rather than by the HMO. The group practice may be established by the HMO and only serve HMO members (&quot;captive group model&quot;). Kaiser Permanente is an example of a captive group model HMO rather than a staff model HMO, as is commonly believed. An HMO may also contract with an existing, independent group practice (&quot;independent group model&quot;), which will generally continue to treat non-HMO patients. Group model HMOs are also considered closed-panel, because doctors must be part of the group practice to participate in the HMO - the HMO panel is closed to other physicians in the community.

If not already part of a group medical practice, physicians may contract with an independent practice association (IPA), which in turn contracts with the HMO. This model is an example of an open-panel HMO, where a physician may maintain their own office and may see non-HMO members.

In the network model, an HMO will contract with any combination of groups, IPAs (Independent Practice Associations), and individual physicians. Since 1990, most HMOs run by managed care organizations with other lines of business (such as PPO, POS and indemnity) use the network model.

== Regulation ==
HMOs in the United States are regulated at both the state and federal levels. They are licensed by the states, under a license that is known as a certificate of authority (COA) rather than under an insurance license. State and federal regulators also issue &quot;mandates&quot;, requirements for health maintenance organizations to provide particular products. In 1972 the National Association of Insurance Commissioners adopted the HMO Model Act, which was intended to provide a model regulatory structure for states to use in authorizing the establishment of HMOs and in monitoring their operation.

== Legal responsibilities ==
HMOs often have a negative public image due to their restrictive appearance. HMOs have been the target of lawsuits claiming that the restrictions of the HMO prevented necessary care. Whether an HMO can be held responsible for a physician&#x27;s negligence partially depends on the HMO&#x27;s screening process. If an HMO only contracts with providers meeting certain quality criteria and advertises this to its members, a court may be more likely to find that the HMO is responsible, just as hospitals can be liable for negligence in selecting physicians. However, an HMO is often insulated from malpractice lawsuits. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) can be held to preempt negligence claims as well. In this case, the deciding factor is whether the harm results from the plan&#x27;s administration or the provider&#x27;s actions. ERISA does not preempt or insulate HMOs from breach of contract or state law claims asserted by an independent, third-party provider of medical services.

<text>German submarine &quot;U-413&quot; was a Type VIIC U-boat built for Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; for service during World War II.

She was laid down on 25 April 1941 at the Danziger Werft (as yard number 114), launched on 15 January 1942 and commissioned on 3 June, with &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Gustav Poel in command. Poel commanded her (receiving promotion to &quot;Kapitänleutnant&quot;), until 19 April 1944, when he was relieved by &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Dietrich Sachse who commanded her until her loss. She conducted seven patrols in World War II, sinking six ships totalling and 1,100 tons.

==Design==
German Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines. &quot;U-413&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert GU 343/38–8 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-413&quot; was fitted with five torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen torpedoes, one SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and one C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty.

==Service history==

===First and second patrols===
The U-boat departed Kiel on 22 October 1942, on her first patrol.

On 14 November 1942, she sank the 20,107 GRT troop transport ship MV &quot;Warwick Castle&quot; (one of the largest sunk in World War II).

At 08:44, the ship, under the command of Henry Richard Leepman-Shaw in Convoy MKF-1X was hit by one of two torpedoes fired, about NW of Cape Espichel, Portugal. The U-boat hit her again at 08:57, causing the ship to sink about one hour later. The master, 61 crew members and 34 service personnel died. 201 crew members, 29 gunners and five naval and 131 service personnel were rescued by , , , and the British . The latter ship had been in Convoy KMF-1 for Operation Torch (the invasion of North Africa).

On 19 November 1942, &quot;U-413&quot; was attacked by a British Lockheed Hudson aircraft with five bombs and was damaged so severely that she had to return to a new base - Brest in occupied France.

Her second patrol was marked by sinking the American ship &quot;West Portal&quot; in mid-Atlantic on 5 February 1943; there were no survivors. She also attacked and sank the Greek &quot;Mount Mycale&quot; on 22 January 1943, northeast of Newfoundland.

===Third and fourth patrols===
Her third patrol saw her leave Brest on 29 March 1943, once more for the Atlantic. There, she sank the British vessel &quot;Wanstead&quot; south of Greenland, whose survivors were picked up by the corvette and the ASW (anti-submarine warfare) .

Her fourth sortie was a frustrating one; it was split into three parts, but she failed to sink any ships.

===Fifth and sixth patrols===
On 20 February 1944, she sank the British 1,100 tons destroyer about 15 miles off Trevose Head, north Cornwall. This was Poel&#x27;s last patrol. He moved to the Naval Academy Mürwik in Flensburg.

===Seventh patrol and sinking===
Her last victory was when she sank &quot;Saint Enogat&quot; on 19 August 1944 in the English Channel.

&quot;U-413&quot; did not suffer any casualties until 20 August 1944, when she was sunk, by one of the 115 strategically placed Naval Mines in the Cornish corridor 15 miles off the coast from Padstow. 45 of her crew were killed; there was one survivor.

The wreck of &quot;U-413&quot; was located and identified by marine archaeologist Innes McCartney in 2000 close to the official sinking position.

===Wolfpacks===
&quot;U-413&quot; took part in 15 wolfpacks, namely:
* Westwall (8 – 19 November 1942) 
* (10 – 31 January 1943) 
* Pfeil (1 – 9 February 1943) 
* Adler (11 – 13 April 1943) 
* Meise (13 – 27 April 1943) 
* Star (27 April – 4 May 1943) 
* Fink (4 – 6 May 1943) 
* Naab (12 – 15 May 1943) 
* Donau 2 (15 – 26 May 1943) 
* Schlieffen (14 – 22 October 1943) 
* Siegfried (22 – 27 October 1943) 
* Siegfried 2 (27 – 30 October 1943) 
* Körner (30 October – 2 November 1943) 
* Tirpitz 2 (2 – 8 November 1943) 
* Eisenhart 8 (9 – 11 November 1943)

==Trivia==
Neal Stephenson&#x27;s novel &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; features a fictitious &quot;U-413&quot;, a milchkuh (supply boat).

<text>The Type XIV U-boat was designed to resupply other U-boats, being the only submarine tenders built which were not surface ships. It was nicknamed in German the &quot;Milchkuh/Milchkühe (pl.)&quot; (English: milk cows).

==Design==
The Type XIV was based on the Type IXD long-range U-boat design, but with a shorter and deeper hull. The boats had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. The U-boats had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarines were powered by two Germaniawerft supercharged four-stroke, six-cylinder diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Siemens-Schuckert 2 GU 345/38-8 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. They had two shafts and two propellers. The boats were capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarines had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boats could operate for at ; when surfaced, they could travel at .

The boats were not fitted with torpedo tubes nor deck guns. The only armament carried was for defense, consisting of two SK C/30 anti-aircraft guns with 2500 rounds as well as a C/30 gun with 3,000 rounds.

The boats had a complement of fifty-three.

==Operation==
Due to its large size, the Type XIV could resupply other boats with of fuel, of motor oil, four torpedoes, and fresh food that was preserved in refrigerator units. In addition, the boats were equipped with a small bakery in order to provide the luxury of fresh bread for crews being resupplied. The Type XIV also had a doctor and medical facility for injured sailors, and even had a two-man brig to imprison sailors awaiting discipline back at home. Type IXC boats otherwise only carried 12 weeks of food supplies, and Type VIIC U-boat carried about 114 tons of diesel fuel.

Cargo was transported by means of a inflatable boat and portable cranes. The flat main deck with cargo hatches and davits was designed in theory to facilitate the transfer of bulk supplies, however its low freeboard made this work extremely hazardous in typical North Atlantic swells that made the deck awash, so often supplies had to be hand-lifted through the smaller but drier conning tower hatches to avoid flooding the boat. Resupply and refueling operations often took hours, putting both the milk cow and the submarine it was servicing at risk.

If the Germans came under Allied attack during a resupply operation, the milk cow would dive first while the attack submarine might fight it out on the surface for a while, as the Type XIV&#x27;s bulk and flat deck made it slower to maneuver and submerge, although it could dive deeper than Type VIICs or IX. The Type XIV had no torpedo tubes or deck guns, only defensive armament of anti-aircraft guns.

The milk cows operated off the North American mainland in the so-called mid-Atlantic gap, far enough from Allied anti-submarine patrols and land-based aircraft while still close enough to provide logistical support to U-boats. In 1942, the milk cows enabled Type VIIC boats to remain on station for a couple more weeks off of the American coast during the &quot;Second Happy Time&quot; raids of the Battle of the Atlantic.

The milk cows were priority targets for Allied forces, as sinking one milk cow would effectively curtail the patrols of a dozen attack U-boats and force them to return home for supplies. Ultra intercepts provided information concerning sailing and routing of the milk cows. This intelligence, coupled with improved Allied radar, air coverage, and hunter-killer groups in the North Atlantic, eliminated most of the milk cows during 1943 including four lost in the month of July alone. By the end of the war all ten had been sunk. Milk cow duty was especially hazardous; 289 sailors were killed out of an estimated complement of 530–576 men.

== List of Type XIV submarines ==
Ten boats of this type were commissioned:
* , commissioned on 15 November 1941, scuttled on 24 July 1943
* , commissioned on 24 December 1941, sunk on 4 October 1943
* , commissioned on 30 January 1942, sunk on 30 July 1943
* , commissioned on 5 March 1942, sunk on 30 July 1943
* , commissioned on 2 April 1942, sunk on 16 May 1943
* , commissioned on 30 April 1942, scuttled on 20 August 1942
* , commissioned on 21 December 1942, sunk on 13 July 1943
* , commissioned on 1 February 1943, sunk on 26 April 1944
* , commissioned on 8 March 1943, sunk on 4 August 1943
* , commissioned on 27 March 1943, sunk on 12 June 1944

Fourteen planned Type XIVs were cancelled. Three of them (&quot;U-491&quot;, &quot;U-492&quot;, &quot;U-493&quot;) were about 75% complete when work was stopped in 1944. The other eleven boats had not been laid down when they were cancelled on 27 May 1944. On that same day Karl Dönitz stopped construction on the Type XX U-boats, large transport boats that would not have been ready until mid-1945.

<text>Socialized medicine is a term used in the United States to describe and discuss systems of universal health care—medical and hospital care for all by means of government regulation of health care and subsidies derived from taxation. Because of historically negative associations with socialism in American culture, the term is usually used pejoratively in American political discourse. The term was first widely used in the United States by advocates of the American Medical Association in opposition to President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s 1947 health care initiative. It was later used in opposition to Medicare. The Affordable Care Act has been described in terms of socialized medicine, but the act&#x27;s objective is rather socialized insurance, not government ownership of hospitals and other facilities as is common in other nations.

==Background==
The original meaning was confined to systems in which the government operates health care facilities and employs health care professionals. This narrower usage would apply to the British National Health Service hospital trusts and health systems that operate in other countries as diverse as Finland, Spain, Israel, and Cuba. The United States Veterans Health Administration and the medical departments of the U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force, would also fall under this narrow definition. When used in that way, the narrow definition permits a clear distinction from single payer health insurance systems, in which the government finances health care but is not involved in care delivery.

More recently, American conservative critics of health care reform have attempted to broaden the term by applying it to any publicly funded system. Canada&#x27;s Medicare system and most of the UK&#x27;s NHS general practitioner and dental services, which are systems where health care is delivered by private business with partial or total government funding, fit the broader definition, as do the health care systems of most of Western Europe. In the United States, Medicare, Medicaid, and the US military&#x27;s TRICARE fall under that definition. In specific regard to military benefits of a (currently) volunteer military, such care is an owed benefit to a specific group as part of an economic exchange, which muddies the definition yet further.

Most industrialized countries and many developing countries operate some form of publicly funded health care with universal coverage as the goal. According to the Institute of Medicine and others, the United States is the only wealthy, industrialized nation that does not provide universal health care.

Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of health policy at the University of North Carolina, maintains that the term is merely a political pejorative that has been defined to mean different levels of government involvement in health care, depending on what the speaker was arguing against at the time.

The term is often used by conservatives in the U.S. to imply that the privately run health care system would become controlled by the government, thereby associating it with socialism, which has negative connotations to some people in American political culture. As such, its usage is controversial, and at odds with the views of conservatives in other countries prepared to defend socialized medicine such as Margaret Thatcher. According to a 2018 Gallup poll, 37% of American adults have a positive view of socialism, including 57% of Democrat-leaning voters and 16% of Republican-leaning voters.

==History of term==
When the term &quot;socialized medicine&quot; first appeared in the United States in the early 20th century, it bore no negative connotations. Otto P. Geier, chairman of the Preventive Medicine Section of the American Medical Association, was quoted in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1917 as praising socialized medicine as a way to &quot;discover disease in its incipiency&quot;, help end &quot;venereal diseases, alcoholism, tuberculosis&quot;, and &quot;make a fundamental contribution to social welfare&quot;. However, by the 1930s, the term socialized medicine was routinely used negatively by conservative opponents of publicly funded health care who wished to imply it represented socialism, and by extension, communism. Universal health care and national health insurance were first proposed by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt. President Franklin D. Roosevelt later championed it, as did Harry S. Truman as part of his Fair Deal and many others. Truman announced before describing his proposal that: &quot;This is not socialized medicine&quot;.

Government involvement in health care was ardently opposed by the AMA, which distributed posters to doctors with slogans such as &quot;Socialized medicine ... will undermine the democratic form of government.&quot; According to T.R. Reid (&quot;The Healing of America&quot;, 2009): 

The AMA conducted a nationwide campaign called Operation Coffee Cup during the late 1950s and early 1960s in opposition to the Democrats&#x27; plans to extend Social Security to include health insurance for the elderly, later known as Medicare. As part of the plan, doctors&#x27; wives would organize coffee meetings in an attempt to convince acquaintances to write letters to Congress opposing the program. In 1961, Ronald Reagan recorded a disc entitled &quot;Ronald Reagan Speaks Out Against Socialized Medicine&quot; warning its audience the &quot;dangers&quot; that socialized medicine could bring. The recording was widely played at Operation Coffee Cup meetings. Other pressure groups began to extend the definition from state managed health care to any form of state finance in health care. President Dwight Eisenhower opposed plans to expand government role in healthcare during his time in office.

In more recent times, the term was brought up again by Republicans in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. In July 2007, one month after the release of Michael Moore&#x27;s film &quot;Sicko&quot;, Rudy Giuliani, the front-runner for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination, attacked the health care plans of Democratic presidential candidates as socialized medicine that was European and socialist, Giuliani claimed that he had a better chance of surviving prostate cancer in the US than he would have had in England and went on to repeat the claim in campaign speeches for three months before making them in a radio advertisement. After the radio ad began running, the use of the statistic was widely criticized by FactCheck.org, PolitiFact.com, by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and others who consulted leading cancer experts and found that Giuliani&#x27;s cancer survival statistics to be false, misleading or &quot;flat wrong&quot;, the numbers having been reported to have been obtained from an opinion article by Giuliani health care advisor David Gratzer, a Canadian psychiatrist in the Manhattan Institute&#x27;s &quot;City Journal&quot; where Gratzer was a senior fellow. &quot;The Times&quot; reported that the British Health Secretary pleaded with Giuliani to stop using the NHS as a political football in American presidential politics. The article reported that not only the figures were five years out of date and wrong but also that US health experts disputed both the accuracy of Giuliani&#x27;s figures and questioned whether it was fair to make a direct comparison. The &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; said that Giuliani&#x27;s tactic of &quot;injecting a little fear&quot; exploited cancer, which was &quot;apparently not beneath a survivor with presidential aspirations&quot;. Giuliani&#x27;s repetition of the error even after it had been pointed out to him earned him more criticism and was awarded four &quot;Pinocchios&quot; by the &quot;Washington Post&quot; for recidivism.

Health care professionals have tended to avoid the term because of its pejorative nature, but if they use it, they do not include publicly funded private medical schemes such as Medicaid. Opponents of state involvement in health care tend to use the looser definition.

The term is widely used by the American media and pressure groups. Some have even stretched use of the term to cover any regulation of health care, publicly financed or not. The term is often used to criticize publicly provided health care outside the US, but rarely to describe similar health care programs there, such as the Veterans Administration clinics and hospitals, military health care, or the single payer programs such as Medicaid and Medicare. Many conservatives use the term to evoke negative sentiment toward health care reform that would involve increasing government involvement in the US health care system.

Medical staff, academics and most professionals in the field and international bodies such as the World Health Organization tend to avoid use of the term. Outside the US, the terms most commonly used are universal health care or public health care. According to health economist Uwe Reinhardt, &quot;strictly speaking, the term &quot;socialized medicine&quot; should be reserved for health systems in which the government operates the production of health care and provides its financing.&quot; Still others say the term has no meaning at all.

In more recent times, the term has gained a more positive reappraisal. Documentary movie maker Michael Moore in his documentary &quot;Sicko&quot; pointed out that Americans do not talk about public libraries or the police or the fire department as being &quot;socialized&quot; and do not have negative opinions of these. Media personalities such as Oprah Winfrey have also weighed in behind the concept of public involvement in healthcare. A 2008 poll indicates that Americans are sharply divided when asked about their views of the expression &quot;socialized medicine&quot;, with a large percentage of Democrats holding favorable views, while a large percentage of Republicans holding unfavorable views. Independents tend to somewhat favor it.

==History in United States==

The Veterans Health Administration, the Military Health System, and the Indian Health Service are examples of socialized medicine in the stricter sense of government administered care, but they are for limited populations.

Medicare and Medicaid are forms of publicly funded health care, which fits the looser definition of socialized medicine. Part B coverage (Medical) requires a monthly premium of $96.40 (and possibly higher) and the first $135 of costs per year also fall to the senior, not the government.

A poll released in February 2008, conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health and Harris Interactive, indicated that Americans are currently divided in their opinions of socialized medicine, and this split correlates strongly with their political party affiliation.

Two thirds of those polled said they understood the term &quot;socialized medicine&quot; very well or somewhat well. When offered descriptions of what such a system could mean, strong majorities believed that it means &quot;the government makes sure everyone has health insurance&quot; (79%) and &quot;the government pays most of the cost of health care&quot; (73%). One third (32%) felt that socialized medicine is a system in which &quot;the government tells doctors what to do&quot;. The poll showed &quot;striking differences&quot; by party affiliation. Among Republicans polled, 70% said that socialized medicine would be worse than the current system. The same percentage of Democrats (70%) said that a socialized medical system would be better than the current system. Independents were more evenly split, with 43% saying socialized medicine would be better and 38% worse.

According to Robert J. Blendon, professor of health policy and political analysis at the Harvard School of Public Health, &quot;The phrase &#x27;socialized medicine&#x27; really resonates as a pejorative with Republicans. However, that so many Democrats believe that socialized medicine would be an improvement is an indication of their dissatisfaction with our current system.&quot; Physicians&#x27; opinions have become more favorable toward &quot;socialized medicine&quot;.

A 2008 survey of doctors, published in &quot;Annals of Internal Medicine&quot;, shows that physicians support universal health care and national health insurance by almost 2 to 1.

==Political controversies in the United States==

Although the marginal scope of free or subsidized medicine provided is much discussed within the political body in most countries with socialized health care systems, there is little or no evidence of strong public pressure for the removal of subsidies or the privatization of health care in those countries. The political distaste for government involvement in health care in the U.S. is a unique counter to the trend found in other developed countries.

In the United States, neither of the main parties favors a socialized system that puts the government in charge of hospitals or doctors, but they do have different approaches to financing and access. Democrats tend to be favorably inclined towards reform that involves more government control over health care financing and citizens&#x27; right of access to health care. Republicans are broadly in favor of the status quo, or a reform of the financing system that gives more power to the citizen, often through tax credits.

Supporters of government involvement in health care argue that government involvement ensures access, quality, and addresses market failures specific to the health care markets. When the government covers the cost of health care, there is no need for individuals or their employers to pay for private insurance.

Opponents also claim that the absence of a market mechanism may slow innovation in treatment and research.

===Cost of care===
Socialized medicine amongst industrialized countries tends to be more affordable than in systems where there is little government involvement. A 2003 study examined costs and outputs in the U.S. and other industrialized countries and broadly concluded that the U.S. spends so much because its health care system is more costly. It noted that &quot;the United States spent considerably more on health care than any other country ... [yet] most measures of aggregate utilization such as physician visits per capita and hospital days per capita were below the OECD median. Since spending is a product of both the goods and services used and their prices, this implies that much higher prices are paid in the United States than in other countries. The researchers examined possible reasons and concluded that input costs were high (salaries, cost of pharmaceutical), and that the complex payment system in the U.S. added higher administrative costs. Comparison countries in Canada and Europe were much more willing to exert monopsony power to drive down prices, whilst the highly fragmented buy side of the U.S. health system was one factor that could explain the relatively high prices in the United States of America. The current fee-for-service payment system also stimulates expensive care by promoting procedures over visits through financially rewarding the former ($1,500 – for doing a 10-minute procedure) vs. the latter ($50 – for a 30–45 minute visit). This causes the proliferation of specialists (more expensive care) and creating, what Don Berwick refers to as, &quot;the world&#x27;s best healthcare system for rescue care&quot;.

Other studies have found no consistent and systematic relationship between the type of financing of health care and cost containment; the efficiency of operation of the health care system itself appears to depend much more on how providers are paid and how the delivery of care is organized than on the method used to raise these funds.

Some supporters argue that government involvement in health care would reduce costs not just because of the exercise of monopsony power, e.g. in drug purchasing, but also because it eliminates profit margins and administrative overhead associated with private insurance, and because it can make use of economies of scale in administration. In certain circumstances, a volume purchaser may be able to guarantee sufficient volume to reduce overall prices while providing greater profitability to the seller, such as in so-called &quot;purchase commitment&quot; programs. Economist Arnold Kling attributes the present cost crisis mainly to the practice of what he calls &quot;premium medicine&quot;, which overuses expensive forms of technology that is of marginal or no proven benefit.

Milton Friedman has argued that government has weak incentives to reduce costs because &quot;nobody spends somebody else&#x27;s money as wisely or as frugally as he spends his own&quot;. Others contend that health care consumption is not like other consumer consumption. Firstly there is a negative utility of consumption (consuming more health care does not make one better off) and secondly there is an information asymmetry between consumer and supplier.

Paul Krugman and Robin Wells argue that all of the evidence indicates that public insurance of the kind available in several European countries achieves equal or better results at much lower cost, a conclusion that also applies within the United States. In terms of actual administrative costs, Medicare spent less than 2% of its resources on administration, while private insurance companies spent more than 13%. The Cato Institute argues that the 2% Medicare cost figure ignores all costs shifted to doctors and hospitals, and alleges that Medicare is not very efficient at all when those costs are incorporated. Some studies have found that the U.S. wastes more on bureaucracy (compared to the Canadian level), and that this excess administrative cost would be sufficient to provide health care to the uninsured population in the U.S.

Notwithstanding the arguments about Medicare, there is overall less bureaucracy in socialized systems than in the present mixed U.S. system. Spending on administration in Finland is 2.1% of all health care costs, and in the UK the figure is 3.3% whereas the U.S. spends 7.3% of all expenditures on administration.

===Quality of care===
Some in the U.S. claim that socialized medicine would reduce health care quality. The quantitative evidence for this claim is not clear. The WHO has used Disability Adjusted Life Expectancy (the number of years an average person can expect to live in good health) as a measure of a nation&#x27;s health achievement, and has ranked its member nations by this measure. The U.S. ranking was 24th, worse than similar industrial countries with high public funding of health such as Canada (ranked 5th), the UK (12th), Sweden (4th), France (3rd) and Japan (1st). But the U.S. ranking was better than some other European countries such as Ireland, Denmark and Portugal, which came 27th, 28th and 29th respectively. Finland, with its relatively high death rate from guns and renowned high suicide rate came above the U.S. in 20th place. The British have a Care Quality Commission that commissions independent surveys of the quality of care given in its health institutions and these are publicly accessible over the internet. These determine whether health organizations are meeting public standards for quality set by government and allows regional comparisons. Whether these results indicate a better or worse situation to that in other countries such as the U.S. is hard to tell because these countries tend to lack a similar set of standards.

===Taxation===
Opponents claim that socialized medicine would require higher taxes but international comparisons do not support this; the ratio of public to private spending on health is lower in the U.S. than that of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, or any EU country, yet the per capita tax funding of health in those countries is already lower than that of the United States.

Taxation is not necessarily an unpopular form of funding for health care. In England, a survey for the British Medical Association of the general public showed overwhelming support for the tax funding of health care. Nine out of ten people agreed or strongly agreed with a statement that the NHS should be funded from taxation with care being free at the point of use.

An opinion piece in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; by two conservative Republicans argues that government sponsored health care will legitimatize support for government services generally, and make an activist government acceptable. &quot;Once a large number of citizens get their health care from the state, it dramatically alters their attachment to government. Every time a tax cut is proposed, the guardians of the new medical-welfare state will argue that tax cuts would come at the expense of health care -- an argument that would resonate with middle-class families entirely dependent on the government for access to doctors and hospitals.&quot;

===Innovation===
Some in the U.S. argue that if government were to use its size to bargain down health care prices, this would undermine American leadership in medical innovation. It is argued that the high level of spending in the U.S. health care system and its tolerance of waste is actually beneficial because it underpins American leadership in medical innovation, which is crucial not just for Americans, but for the entire world.

Others point out that the American health care system spends more on state-of-the-art treatment for people who have good insurance, and spending is reduced on those lacking it and question the costs and benefits of some medical innovations, noting, for example, that &quot;rising spending on new medical technologies designed to address heart disease has not meant that more patients have survived&quot;.

===Access===
One of the goals of socialized medicine systems is ensuring universal access to health care. Opponents of socialized medicine say that access for low-income individuals can be achieved by means other than socialized medicine, for example, income-related subsidies can function without public provision of either insurance or medical services. Economist Milton Friedman said the role of the government in health care should be restricted to financing hard cases. Universal coverage can also be achieved by making purchase of insurance compulsory. For example, European countries with socialized medicine in the broader sense, such as Germany and The Netherlands, operate in this way. A legal obligation to purchase health insurance is akin to a mandated health tax, and the use of public subsidies is a form of directed income redistribution via the tax system. Such systems give the consumer a free choice amongst competing insurers whilst achieving universality to a government directed minimum standard.

Compulsory health insurance or savings are not limited to so-called socialized medicine, however. Singapore&#x27;s health care system, which is often referred to as a free-market or mixed system, makes use of a combination of compulsory participation and state price controls to achieve the same goals.

===Rationing (access, coverage, price, and time)===
Part of the current debate about health care in the United States revolves around whether the Affordable Care Act as part of health care reform will result in a more systematic and logical allocation of health care. Opponents tend to believe that the law will eventually result in a government takeover of health care and ultimately to socialized medicine and rationing based not on being able to afford the care you want but on whether a third party other than the patient and the doctor decides whether the procedure or the cost is justifiable. Supporters of reform point out that health care rationing already exists in the United States through insurance companies issuing denial for reimbursement on the grounds that the insurance company believes the procedure is experimental or will not assist even though the doctor has recommended it. A public insurance plan was not included in the Affordable Care Act but some argue that it would have added to health care access choices, and others argue that the central issue is whether health care is rationed sensibly.

Opponents of reform invoke the term socialized medicine because they say it will lead to health care rationing by denial of coverage, denial of access, and use of waiting lists, but often do so without acknowledging coverage denial, lack of access and waiting lists exist in the U.S. health care system currently or that waiting lists in the U.S. are sometimes longer than the waiting lists in countries with socialized medicine. Proponents of the reform proposal point out a public insurer is not akin to a socialized medicine system because it will have to negotiate rates with the medical industry just as other insurers do and cover its cost with premiums charged to policyholders just as other insurers do without any form of subsidy.

There is a frequent misunderstanding to think that waiting happens in places like the United Kingdom and Canada but does not happen in the United States. For instance it is not uncommon even for emergency cases in some U.S. hospitals to be boarded on beds in hallways for 48 hours or more due to lack of inpatient beds and people in the U.S. rationed out by being unable to afford their care are simply never counted and may never receive the care they need, a factor that is often overlooked. Statistics about waiting times in national systems are an honest approach to the issue of those waiting for access to care. Everyone waiting for care is reflected in the data, which, in the UK for example, are used to inform debate, decision-making and research within the government and the wider community. Some people in the U.S. are rationed out of care by unaffordable care or denial of access by HMOs and insurers or simply because they cannot afford co-pays or deductibles even if they have insurance. These people wait an indefinitely long period and may never get care they need, but actual numbers are simply unknown because they are not recorded in official statistics.

Opponents of the current reform care proposals fear that U.S. comparative effective research (a plan introduced in the stimulus bill) will be used to curtail spending and ration treatments, which is one function of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), arguing that rationing by market pricing rather by government is the best way for care to be rationed. However, when defining any group scheme, the same rules must apply to everyone in the scheme so some coverage rules had to be established. Britain has a national budget for public funded health care, and recognizes there has to be a logical trade off between spending on expensive treatments for some against, for example, caring for sick children. NICE is therefore applying the same market pricing principles to make the hard job of deciding between funding some treatments and not funding others on behalf of everyone in the insured pool. This rationing does not preclude choice of obtaining insurance coverage for excluded treatment as insured persons do having the choice to take out supplemental health insurance for drugs and treatments that the NHS does not cover (at least one private insurer offers such a plan) or from meeting treatment costs out-of-pocket.

The debate in the U.S. over rationing has enraged some in the UK and statements made by politicians such as Sarah Palin and Chuck Grassley resulted in a mass Internet protest on websites such as Twitter and Facebook under the banner title &quot;welovetheNHS&quot; with positive stories of NHS experiences to counter the negative ones being expressed by these politicians and others and by certain media outlets such as &quot;Investor&#x27;s Business Daily&quot; and Fox News. In the UK, it is private health insurers that ration care (in the sense of not covering the most common services such as access to a primary care physician or excluding pre-existing conditions) rather than the NHS. Free access to a general practitioner is a core right in the NHS, but private insurers in the UK will not pay for payments to a private primary care physician. Private insurers exclude many of the most common services as well as many of the most expensive treatments, whereas the vast majority of these are not excluded from the NHS but are obtainable at no cost to the patient. According to the Association of British Insurers (ABI), a typical policy will exclude the following: going to a general practitioner; going to accident and emergency; drug abuse; HIV/AIDS; normal pregnancy; gender reassignment; mobility aids, such as wheelchairs; organ transplant; injuries arising from dangerous hobbies (often called hazardous pursuits); pre-existing conditions; dental services; outpatient drugs and dressings; deliberately self-inflicted injuries; infertility; cosmetic treatment; experimental or unproven treatment or drugs; and war risks. Chronic illnesses, such as diabetes and end stage renal disease requiring dialysis are also excluded from coverage. Insurers do not cover these because they feel they do not need to since the NHS already provides coverage and to provide the choice of a private provider would make the insurance prohibitively expensive. Thus in the UK there is cost shifting from the private sector to the public sector, which again is the &quot;opposite&quot; of the allegation of cost shifting in the U.S. from public providers such as Medicare and Medicaid to the private sector.

Palin had alleged that America will create rationing &quot;death panels&quot; to decide whether old people could live or die, again widely taken to be a reference to NICE. U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley alleged that he was told that Senator Edward Kennedy would have been refused the brain tumor treatment he was receiving in the United States had he instead lived a country with government run health care. This, he alleged, would have been due to rationing because of Kennedy&#x27;s age (77 years) and the high cost of treatment. The UK Department of Health said that Grassley&#x27;s claims were &quot;just wrong&quot; and reiterated health service in Britain provides health care on the basis of clinical need regardless of age or ability to pay. The chairman of the British Medical Association, Hamish Meldrum, said he was dismayed by the &quot;jaw-droppingly untruthful attacks&quot; made by American critics. The chief executive of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), told &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper that &quot;it is neither true, nor is it anything you could extrapolate from anything we&#x27;ve ever recommended&quot; that Kennedy would be denied treatment by the NHS. The business journal &quot;Investor&#x27;s Business Daily&quot; claimed mathematician and astrophysicist Stephen Hawking, who had ALS and spoke with the aid of an American-accented voice synthesizer, would not have survived if he had been treated in the British National Health Service. Hawking was British and was treated throughout his life (67 years) by the NHS and issued a statement to the effect he owed his life to the quality of care he has received from the NHS.

Some argue that countries with national health care may use waiting lists as a form of rationing compared to countries that ration by price, such as the United States, according to several commentators and healthcare experts. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; columnist Ezra Klein compared 27% of Canadians reportedly waiting four months or more for elective surgery with 26% of Americans reporting that they did not fulfill a prescription due to cost (compared to only 6% of Canadians). Britain&#x27;s former age-based policy that once prevented the use of kidney dialysis as treatment for older patients with renal problems, even to those who can privately afford the costs, has been cited as another example. A 1999 study in the &quot;Journal of Public Economics&quot; analyzed the British National Health Service and found that its waiting times function as an effective market disincentive, with a low elasticity of demand with respect to time.

Supporters of private price rationing over waiting time rationing, such as &quot;The Atlantic&quot; columnist Megan McArdle, argue time rationing leaves patients worse off since their time (measured as an opportunity cost) is worth much more than the price they would pay. Opponents also state categorizing patients based on factors such as social value to the community or age will not work in a heterogeneous society without a common ethical consensus such as the U.S. Doug Bandow of the CATO Institute wrote that government decision making would &quot;override the differences in preferences and circumstances&quot; for individuals and that it is a matter of personal liberty to be able to buy as much or as little care as one wants. Neither argument recognizes the fact that in most countries with socialized medicine, a parallel system of private health care allows people to pay extra to reduce their waiting time. The exception is that some provinces in Canada disallow the right to bypass queuing unless the matter is one in which the rights of the person under the constitution.

A 1999 article in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot;, stated &quot;there is much merit in using waiting lists as a rationing mechanism for elective health care if the waiting lists are managed efficiently and fairly&quot;. Arthur Kellermann, associate dean for health policy at Emory University, stated rationing by ability to pay rather than by anticipated medical benefits in the U.S. makes its system more unproductive, with poor people avoiding preventive care and eventually using expensive emergency treatment. Ethicist Daniel Callahan has written that U.S. culture overly emphasizes individual autonomy rather than communitarian morals and that stops beneficial rationing by social value, which benefits everyone.

Some argue that waiting lists result in great pain and suffering, but again evidence for this is unclear. In a recent survey of patients admitted to hospital in the UK from a waiting list or by planned appointment, only 10% reported they felt they should have been admitted sooner than they were. 72% reported the admission was as timely as they felt necessary. Medical facilities in the U.S. do not report waiting times in national statistics as is done in other countries and it is a myth to believe there is no waiting for care in the U.S. Some argue that wait times in the U.S. could actually be as long as or longer than in other countries with universal health care.

There is considerable argument about whether any of the health bills currently before congress will introduce rationing. Howard Dean for example contested in an interview that they do not. However, &quot;Politico&quot; has pointed out that all health systems contain elements of rationing (such as coverage rules) and the public health care plan will therefore implicitly involve some element of rationing.

===Political interference and targeting===
In the UK, where government employees or government-employed sub-contractors deliver most health care, political interference is quite hard to discern. Most supply-side decisions are in practice under the control of medical practitioners and of boards comprising the medical profession. There is some antipathy towards the target-setting by politicians in the UK. Even the NICE criteria for public funding of medical treatments were never set by politicians. Nevertheless, politicians have set targets, for instance to reduce waiting times and to improve choice. Academics have pointed out that the claims of success of the targeting are statistically flawed.

The veracity and significance of the claims of targeting interfering with clinical priorities are often hard to judge. For example, some UK ambulance crews have complained that hospitals would deliberately leave patients with ambulance crews to prevent an accident and emergency department (A&amp;E, or emergency room) target-time for treatment from starting to run. The Department of Health vehemently denied the claim, because the A&amp;E time begins when the ambulance arrives at the hospital and not after the handover. It defended the A&amp;E target by pointing out that the percentage of people waiting four hours or more in A&amp;E had dropped from just under 25% in 2004 to less than 2% in 2008. The original &quot;Observer&quot; article reported that in London, 14,700 ambulance turnarounds were longer than an hour and 332 were more than two hours when the target turnaround time is 15 minutes. However, in the context of the total number of emergency ambulance attendances by the London Ambulance Service each year (approximately 865,000), these represent just 1.6% and 0.03% of all ambulance calls. The proportion of these attributable to patients left with ambulance crews is not recorded. At least one junior doctor has complained that the four-hour A&amp;E target is too high and leads to unwarranted actions that are not in the best interests of patients.

Political targeting of waiting-times in Britain has had dramatic effects. The National Health Service reports that the median admission wait-time for elective inpatient treatment (non-urgent hospital treatment) in England at the end of August 2007, was just under 6 weeks, and 87.5% of patients were admitted within 13 weeks. Reported waiting times in England also overstate the true waiting-time. This is because the clock starts ticking when the patient has been referred to a specialist by the GP and it only stops when the medical procedure is completed. The 18-week maximum waiting period target thus includes all the time taken for the patient to attend the first appointment with the specialist, time for any tests called for by the specialist to determine precisely the root of the patient&#x27;s problem and the best way to treat it. It excludes time for any intervening steps deemed necessary prior to treatment, such as recovery from some other illness or the losing of excessive weight.

<text>Hemanta Mukhopadhyay (16 June 1920 – 26 September 1989), known professionally as Hemanta Mukherjee and Hemant Kumar, was an Indian music director and a playback singer who primarily sang in Bengali and Hindi, along with several other Indian languages, including Marathi, Gujarati, Odia, Assamese, Tamil, Punjabi, Bhojpuri, Konkani, Sanskrit and Urdu. He was a artist in Bengali and Hindi film music, Rabindra Sangeet, and various other genres. He was the recipient of two National Awards for Best Male Playback Singer and was popularly known as the &quot;Voice of God&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Hemanta was born in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh, at his maternal grandfather&#x27;s residence, where his grandfather served as a physician. His paternal family originated from Jaynagar Majilpur and had migrated to Kolkata in the early 1900s. Growing up in Kolkata, he received his early education at Nasiruddin School before transferring to Mitra Institution School in Bhowanipore. During his school years, he formed lasting friendships with Subhash Mukhopadhyay, who would later become a celebrated poet, and writer Santosh Kumar Ghosh.

Hemanta enrolled in the Bengal Technical Institute at Jadavpur (now Jadavpur University) to pursue an engineering diploma. However, he left academics due to health issues and to pursue a career in music, despite his father&#x27;s disapproval. He briefly experimented with literature and published a short story in the Bengali magazine &quot;Desh&quot;, but by the late 1930s, he had decided to dedicate himself entirely to music.

==Early career==
Hemanta&#x27;s debut as a playback singer came in 1940 with the Bengali film &quot;Rajkumarer Nirbbasan&quot;, where he sang under the musical direction of S.D. Burman. This was followed by &quot;Nimai Sanyas&quot; (1941), scored by Hariprasanna Das. In 1943, he composed his first original songs, &quot;Katha Kayonako Shudhu Shono&quot; and &quot;Amar Biraha Akashe Priya&quot;, with lyrics by Amiya Bagchi. His entry into Hindi cinema occurred in 1942 with the film &quot;Meenakshi&quot;, followed by &quot;Irada&quot; (1944), under composer Amar Nath&#x27;s direction.

Hemanta established himself as a prominent exponent of Rabindra Sangeet with his first recorded piece in the genre appearing in the Bengali film &quot;Priya Bandhabi&quot; (1944). The song &quot;Pather Sesh Kothaye&quot; marked the beginning of his journey with Tagore&#x27;s compositions. That same year, he recorded his first non-film Rabindra Sangeet album under the Columbia label, featuring &quot;Aamar Aar Habe Na Deri&quot; and &quot;Keno Pantha E Chanchalata&quot;. An earlier recording of &quot;Aamaar mallikabone&quot; for All India Radio/Akashvani has been lost to time.
His directorial debut as a music director came with the Bengali film &quot;Abhiyatri&quot; in 1947. During this period, he worked alongside contemporary male vocalists including Jaganmay Mitra, Robin Majumdar, Satya Chowdhury, Dhananjay Bhattacharya, Sudhirlal Chakraborty, Bechu Dutta and Talat Mahmood. While his early recordings garnered critical acclaim, major commercial success eluded him until 1947.

==Emergence as a national artist==


In the mid-1940s, Hemanta became actively involved with the Indian People&#x27;s Theatre Association (IPTA), where he formed a significant collaboration with fellow member and composer Salil Chowdhury. The devastating Bengal famine of 1943 and the inaction of both British authorities and wealthy Indians had been instrumental in IPTA&#x27;s formation.
His 1947 recording of &quot;Ganyer Badhu&quot; (&quot;The rural bride&quot;), composed and written by Salil Chowdhury, marked a turning point in his career. This unconventional six-minute composition, recorded on both sides of a 78 rpm disc, departed from traditional Bengali song structure and romantic themes. Instead, it portrayed the tragic transformation of an idyllic rural life devastated by famine and poverty. The song&#x27;s unprecedented success established Hemanta as a leading voice in eastern India, elevating him above his male contemporaries. This successful partnership with Salil Chowdhury continued through numerous popular collaborations in subsequent years.

During this period, Hemanta received increasing opportunities as a music composer for Bengali films, notably working with director Hemen Gupta. When Gupta relocated to Mumbai, he invited Hemanta to compose for his Hindi directorial debut &quot;Anandmath&quot; under the Filmistan banner. This led to Hemanta&#x27;s migration to Mumbai in 1951, where he joined Filmistan Studios. He named his Mumbai residence in Khar after Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s Gitanjali. &quot;Anand Math&quot; (1952) achieved moderate success, with its standout contribution being Lata Mangeshkar&#x27;s rendition of &#x27;Vande mataram&#x27;, which Hemanta set to a stirring martial tune.
Following &quot;Anandamath&quot;, Hemanta composed for several Filmistan productions, including &quot;Shart&quot;, gaining modest popularity. Simultaneously, he established himself as a prominent playback singer in Mumbai. His collaborations with S. D. Burman for actor Dev Anand produced numerous hits, including &quot;Yeh Raat Yeh Chandni Phir Kahan&quot; (&quot;Jaal&quot;, 1952), &quot;Chup Hai Dharti&quot; and &quot;Teri Duniya Mein Jeene Se&quot; (&quot;House No. 44&quot;, 1955), &quot;Hai Apna Dil To Awara&quot; (&quot;Solva Saal&quot;, 1958), and &quot;Na Tum Humen Jano&quot; (&quot;Baat Ek Raat Ki&quot;, 1962). He also provided playback for other leading actors including Pradeep Kumar (&quot;Nagin&quot;, &quot;Detective&quot;), Sunil Dutt (&quot;Duniya Jhukti Hain&quot;), and later Biswajeet (&quot;Bees Saal Baad&quot;, &quot;Bin Badal Barsaat&quot;, &quot;Kohra&quot;) and Dharmendra (&quot;Anupama&quot;), while also serving as the music composer for these films.

==Career rise==
By the mid-1950s, Hemanta had consolidated his position as a prominent singer and composer. In Bengal, he was one of the foremost exponents of Rabindra Sangeet and perhaps the most sought-after male singer. In a ceremony organized by Hemanta Mukherjee to honor Debabrata Biswas (1911–1980), the legendary Rabindra Sangeet exponent, in Calcutta in March 1980, Debabrata Biswas unhesitatingly mentioned Hemanta as &quot;the second hero&quot; to popularise Rabindra Sangeet, the first being the legendary Pankaj Kumar Mullick. In Mumbai, along with playback singing, Hemanta carved a niche as a composer. He composed music for a Hindi film called &quot;Nagin&quot; (1954) which became a major success owing largely to its music. Songs of &quot;Nagin&quot; remained chart-toppers continuously for two years and culminated in Hemanta receiving the prestigious Filmfare Best Music Director Award in 1955. The very same year, he scored music for a Bengali movie &quot;Shap Mochan&quot; in which he played back four songs for the Bengali actor Uttam Kumar. This started a long partnership between Hemanta and Uttam as a playback singer-actor pair. They were the most popular singer-actor duo in Bengali cinema over the next decade.

In the latter part of the 1950s, Hemanta composed music and sang for several Bengali and Hindi films and recorded several Rabindra Sangeet and Bengali non-film songs. Almost all of these, especially his Bengali songs, became very popular. This period can be seen as the zenith of his career and lasted for almost a decade. Salil Chowdhury and Lata Mangeshkar stated Hemanta as the Voice Of God. He sang songs composed by the major music directors in Bengal such as Nachiketa Ghosh, Robin Chatterjee and Salil Chowdhury. Some of the notable films Hemanta himself composed music for during this period include &quot;Harano Sur&quot;, &quot;Marutirtha Hinglaj&quot;, &quot;Neel Akasher Neechey&quot;, &quot;Lukochuri&quot;, &quot;Swaralipi&quot;, &quot;Deep Jwele Jaai&quot;, &quot;Shesh Parjanta&quot;, &quot;Kuhak&quot;, &quot;Dui Bhai&quot;, and &quot;Saptapadi&quot; in Bengali, and &quot;Jagriti&quot; and &quot;Ek Hi Raasta&quot; in Hindi.

==Production==
In the late 1950s, Hemanta ventured into movie production under his own banner: Hemanta-Bela Productions. The first movie under this banner was a Bengali film directed by Mrinal Sen, titled Neel Akasher Neechey (1959). The story was based on the travails of a Chinese street hawker in
Calcutta in the backdrop of India&#x27;s freedom struggle. The movie went on to win the President&#x27;s Gold Medal — the highest honour for a movie from the Government of India. In the next decade, Hemanta&#x27;s production company was renamed Geetanjali productions and it produced several Hindi movies such as Bees Saal Baad, Kohraa, Biwi Aur Makaan, Faraar, Rahgir and Khamoshi all of which had music by Hemanta. Only Bees Saal Baad and Khamoshi were major commercial successes.

Back in Bengal, Hemanta scored music for a movie titled Palatak in 1963 where he experimented with merging Bengal folk music and light music. This proved to be a major success and Hemanta&#x27;s composition style changed noticeably for many of his future films in Bengal such as Baghini, and Balika Badhu. In Bengali films Manihar and Adwitiya, both of which were major musical as well as commercial successes, his compositions had a light classical tinge. In 1961, for commemorating Rabindranath Tagore&#x27;s birth centenary, the Gramophone Company of India
featured Rabindrasangeet by Hemanta in a large portion of its commemorative output. This too proved to be a major commercial success. Hemanta went on several overseas concert tours including his trip to the West Indies. Overall, in the 1960s decade, he retained his position as the major male singer in Bengal and as a composer and singer to be reckoned with in Hindi films.

In the 1960s he was the predominant and lead male voice in many of Tagore&#x27;s musical dramas like Valmiki Pratibha, Shyama, Sapmochan, Chitrangada and Chandalika. With Kanika Bandopadhyay (1924–2000) and Suchitra Mitra (1924–2010), who were the lead female voices in these, he was part of the Rabindra Sangeet triumvirate that was popular and respected. It was referred to as &#x27;Hemanta-Kanika-Suchitra&#x27; and, with Debabrata Biswas, this quartet was and continues to be the most heard exponents of Tagore compositions. Asoktaru Bandopadhyay, Chinmoy Chattopadhyay, Sagar Sen, Sumitra Sen, and Ritu Guha were the other leading exponents of Rabindra Sangeet at that time.

==Later career==
In the 1970s, Hemanta&#x27;s contribution to Hindi films was nominal. He scored music for a handful of his home productions, but none of these movies nor their music were successful. In Bengal, however, he remained the foremost exponent of Rabindra Sangeet, film and non-film songs. His output continued to be popular for most of the decade. Some of them are &quot;Jodi Jante Chao Tumi&quot; (1972), &quot;Ek Gochha Rajanigandha&quot;, &quot;Aamay Prasno Kore Nil Dhrubatara&quot;, &quot;Sedin Tomay Dekhechilam&quot; (1974), &quot;Khirki Theke Singho Duar&quot; (Stree, 1971), &quot;Ke Jane Ko Ghonta&quot; (Sonar Khancha, 1974), &quot;Jeona Daraon Bandhu&quot; (Phuleswari, 1975) and popularised Rabindra sangeet using them beautifully in films as per situations. A very popular and classic example is the song &quot;Chorono Dhorite Diyogo Amare&quot; in Dadar Kirti (1980). In 1971, Hemanta debuted as a film director in for his self-produced Bengali movie Anindita. It didn&#x27;t fare exceedingly well at the box office. However, his rendition &quot;Diner Seshe Ghumer Deshe&quot; was one of his best and most popular Rabindra Sangeet renditions. In the same year, Hemanta went to Hollywood by responding to film director Conrad Rooks and score the music of Conrad&#x27;s Siddhartha and played back &quot;O Nadire&quot; (composed and sung by him earlier in Neel Akasher Neechey (1959) in that film. He was the first Indian singer to playback in Hollywood. The US government honored Hemanta by conferring him with the citizenship of Baltimore, Maryland; the first-ever singer of India to get US citizenship. In the early to mid-1970s, two major music composers in Bengal, Nachiketa Ghosh and Robin Chatterjee, who had worked closely with Hemanta, since the early 1950s, died. Simultaneously, music composed by Hemanta for Bengali films like &quot;Phuleswari&quot;, &quot;Raag Anurag&quot;, &quot;Ganadebata&quot; and &quot;Dadar Kirti&quot; established him as the major film music composer in the Bengal movie scene. In 1979, Hemanta re-recorded some of his earlier works with composer Salil Chowdhury from the 1940s and 1950s. This album, titled &quot;Legend of Glory, vol. 2&quot;, was a major commercial success.

In 1980, Hemanta had a heart attack that severely affected his vocal capabilities, especially his breath control. He continued to record songs in the early eighties, but his voice was a shade of its rich baritone past. In 1984, Hemanta was felicitated by different organizations, most notably by the Gramophone Company of India, for completing 50 years in music. That very year Hemanta released his last album with Gramophone Company of India — a 45 rpm extended play disc with four non-film songs. Over the next few years, Hemanta released a few non-film songs for small-time companies that had cropped up in the nascent cassette-based music industry. Only a few of these were commercially successful. He composed music for a handful of Bengali movies and one Bengali and one Hindi tele-series. However, by this time he had become an institution, a beloved and revered personality who was a courteous and friendly gentleman. His philanthropic activities included running a homeopathic hospital in memory of his late father in their native village in Baharu, in the South 24 Parganas district of West Bengal. He continued to feature regularly on All India Radio, Doordarshan (TV), and live programs/concerts during this period.

In a television interview, recorded in the early 1990s, to noted elocutionist Gauri Ghosh, his wife Bela Mukherjee recalled that she never knew during his lifetime the number of families and persons he helped to put up financially or otherwise; it was only after his departure that this truth gradually unveiled.

In 1987, he was nominated for Padma Bhushan which he refused, having already turned down a previous offer to receive Padma Shri in the 1970s. In this year, he was publicly felicitated in Netaji Indoor Stadium in Calcutta for completing 50 years in the musical journey, where, Lata Mangeshkar presented him with the memento on behalf of his fans and admirers. Despite his aging voice, he became the Best Male Singer in 1988 for his rendition in the film &quot;Lalan Fakir&quot;.

In September 1989 he traveled to Dhaka, Bangladesh to receive the Michael Madhusudan Award, as well as to perform a concert. Immediately after returning from this trip he suffered another heart attack on 26 September 1989 and died at 11:15 pm in a nursing home in South Calcutta.

==Personal life==
Hemanta had three brothers and a sister Nilima. His younger brother Tarajyoti was a Bengali short story writer. His youngest brother Amal composed music as well as sang for some Bengali movies, most notably for Abak Prithibi and &quot;Hospital&quot;. Amal recorded a few songs in the 1960s as well with Hemant as music director, most notably the song &quot;Jiboner Anekta Path Eklai&quot;. In 1945, Hemanta married Bela Mukherjee, a singer from Bengal. Although she had sung some popular songs in the movie &quot;Kashinath&quot;, she did not actively pursue her musical career after marriage. They had two children, a son Jayant, and a daughter Ranu. Ranu also pursued a music career in the late 1960s and early 1970s, with somewhat limited success. Jayant is married to Moushumi Chatterjee, a Bengali film actress.

== Death and legacy ==
On 26 September 1989, Hemant fell ill after returning from a concert in Dhaka. He died shortly after, due to a massive cardiac arrest. According to his daughter-in-law Moushumi Chatterjee, his last words were &quot;Ki koshto, ki koshto (&#x27;such pain, such pain&#x27;).&quot;

Hemant&#x27;s legacy still lives on through the songs that he has recorded during his lifetime, as well as the music he has composed. Due to the commercial viability of his songs, the Gramophone Company of India (or Saregama) still releases at least one album of his every year, repackaging his older songs. The Kolkata Metro&#x27;s Hemanta Mukhopadhyay metro station is named after him.

<text>A packet analyzer (also packet sniffer or network analyzer) is a computer program or computer hardware such as a packet capture appliance that can analyze and log traffic that passes over a computer network or part of a network. Packet capture is the process of intercepting and logging traffic. As data streams flow across the network, the analyzer captures each packet and, if needed, decodes the packet&#x27;s raw data, showing the values of various fields in the packet, and analyzes its content according to the appropriate RFC or other specifications.

A packet analyzer used for intercepting traffic on wireless networks is known as a wireless analyzer - those designed specifically for Wi-Fi networks are Wi-Fi analyzers. While a packet analyzer can also be referred to as a network analyzer or protocol analyzer these terms can also have other meanings. Protocol analyzer can technically be a broader, more general class that includes packet analyzers/sniffers. However, the terms are frequently used interchangeably.

==Capabilities==
On wired shared-medium networks, such as Ethernet, Token Ring, and FDDI, depending on the network structure (hub or switch), it may be possible to capture all traffic on the network from a single machine. On modern networks, traffic can be captured using a network switch using port mirroring, which mirrors all packets that pass through designated ports of the switch to another port, if the switch supports port mirroring. A network tap is an even more reliable solution than to use a monitoring port since taps are less likely to drop packets during high traffic load.

On wireless LANs, traffic can be captured on one channel at a time, or by using multiple adapters, on several channels simultaneously.

On wired broadcast and wireless LANs, to capture unicast traffic between other machines, the network adapter capturing the traffic must be in promiscuous mode. On wireless LANs, even if the adapter is in promiscuous mode, packets not for the service set the adapter is configured for are usually ignored. To see those packets, the adapter must be in monitor mode. No special provisions are required to capture multicast traffic to a multicast group the packet analyzer is already monitoring, or broadcast traffic.

When traffic is captured, either the entire contents of packets or just the headers are recorded. Recording just headers reduces storage requirements, and avoids some privacy legal issues, yet often provides sufficient information to diagnose problems.

Captured information is decoded from raw digital form into a human-readable format that lets engineers review exchanged information. Protocol analyzers vary in their abilities to display and analyze data.

Some protocol analyzers can also generate traffic. These can act as protocol testers. Such testers generate protocol-correct traffic for functional testing, and may also have the ability to deliberately introduce errors to test the device under test&#x27;s ability to handle errors.

Protocol analyzers can also be hardware-based, either in probe format or, as is increasingly common, combined with a disk array. These devices record packets or packet headers to a disk array.

==Uses==
Packet analyzers can:

* Analyze network problems
* Detect network intrusion attempts
* Detect network misuse by internal and external users
* Documenting regulatory compliance through logging all perimeter and endpoint traffic
* Gain information for effecting a network intrusion
* Identify data collection and sharing of software such as operating systems (for strengthening privacy, control and security)
* Aid in gathering information to isolate exploited systems
* Monitor WAN bandwidth utilization
* Monitor network usage (including internal and external users and systems)
* Monitor data in transit
* Monitor WAN and endpoint security status
* Gather and report network statistics
* Identify suspect content in network traffic
* Troubleshoot performance problems by monitoring network data from an application
* Serve as the primary data source for day-to-day network monitoring and management
* Spy on other network users and collect sensitive information such as login details or users cookies (depending on any content encryption methods that may be in use)
* Reverse engineer proprietary protocols used over the network
* Debug client/server communications
* Debug network protocol implementations
* Verify adds, moves, and changes
* Verify internal control system effectiveness (firewalls, access control, Web filter, spam filter, proxy)

Packet capture can be used to fulfill a warrant from a law enforcement agency to wiretap all network traffic generated by an individual. Internet service providers and VoIP providers in the United States must comply with Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act regulations. Using packet capture and storage, telecommunications carriers can provide the legally required secure and separate access to targeted network traffic and can use the same device for internal security purposes. Collecting data from a carrier system without a warrant is illegal due to laws about interception. By using end-to-end encryption, communications can be kept confidential from telecommunication carriers and legal authorities.

<doc id="59120" wikidata="Q110802" url="?curid=59120" title="Strait of Tartary">
<text>Strait of Tartary or Gulf of Tartary (; ; ; ) is a strait in the Pacific Ocean dividing the Russian island of Sakhalin from mainland Asia (South-East Russia), connecting the Sea of Okhotsk (Nevelskoy Strait) on the north with the Sea of Japan on the south. It is long, wide, and only deep at its shallowest point.

== History ==
=== Yuan dynasty ===
During the Yuan dynasty, the Yuan armies crossed the strait in the Mongol invasions of Sakhalin. Alleged remnants of a Chinese fort dating back to the Mongol Yuan era can be found in Sakhalin today.

&quot;Tartary&quot; is an older name used by Europeans to refer to a vast region covering Inner Asia, Central Asia and North Asia. The toponym is derived from the Medieval ethnonym Tartars, which was applied to various Turkic and Mongol semi-nomadic empires, including the Yuan dynasty that ruled over China and the straits of Northeast Asia.

=== Qing dynasty ===
During the destruction of the Ming dynasty and rise of the Qing dynasty in 1644, the name &quot;Tartars&quot; became applied to the Manchus as well, and Manchuria (and Mongolia) became known to the Europeans as the &quot;Chinese Tartary&quot;. Accordingly, when La Pérouse charted most of the strait between Sakhalin and the mainland &quot;Chinese Tartary&quot; in 1787, the body of water received the name of the Strait (or Channel, or Gulf) of Tartary.

In Japan, the strait is named after Mamiya Rinzō, who traveled to the strait in 1808 whereof the name was introduced by Philipp Franz von Siebold in his book &quot;Nippon: Archiv zur Beschreibung von Japan&quot; (1832–54).
On Russian maps, the short narrowest section of the strait (south of the mouth of the Amur) is called Nevelskoy Strait, after Admiral Gennady Nevelskoy, who explored the area in 1848; the body of water north of there, into which the Amur River flows, is the Amur Liman; and the name of &quot;Strait of Tartary&quot; is reserved for the largest section of the body of water, south of Nevelskoy Strait.

The Tartar Strait was a puzzle to European explorers since, when approached from the south, it becomes increasingly shallow and looks like the head of a bay. In 1787 La Perouse decided not to risk it and turned south even though locals had told him that Sakhalin was an island. In 1797 William Broughton also decided that the Gulf of Tartary was a bay and turned south. In 1805 Adam Johann von Krusenstern failed to penetrate the strait from the north. Mamiya Rinzō&#x27;s journey of 1808 was little known to Europeans. Gennady Nevelskoy passed the strait from the north in 1848. The Russians kept this a secret and used it to evade a British fleet during the Crimean War.

=== Recent history ===
&quot;S-117&quot; was a Soviet Shchuka class submarine that was lost on or about December 15, 1952, due to unknown causes in the Strait of Tartary in the Sea of Japan. The boat may have collided with a surface ship or struck a mine. All forty-seven crewmen died in the incident.

The southeastern part of the Strait of Tartary was the site of one of the tensest incidents of the Cold War, when on September 1, 1983, Korean Air Lines Flight 007, carrying 269 people including a sitting U.S. congressman, Larry McDonald, strayed into the Soviet air space and was attacked by a Soviet Su-15 interceptor just west of Sakhalin Island. The plane came down on the waters off the strait&#x27;s only land mass, Moneron Island. An intensive naval search by the U.S. with assistance of Japanese and Korean vessels was carried on in a area of the strait just north of Moneron Island.

==1956 causeway proposal==
In 1956 the Soviet government proposed that a causeway be built at the Tartar Strait to block cold water from flowing into the Sea of Japan therefore raising the temperature in areas around the Sea of Japan. The Russians claimed it would raise the temperature of the Sea of Japan by an average of 35 °F (19.5 °C).

==Transportation==

Since 1973, Vanino-Kholmsk train ferry operates across the strait, connecting the port of Vanino, Khabarovsk Krai on the mainland with Kholmsk on Sakhalin Island.

Looking at the map, one could think that the Strait of Tartary would provide a convenient connection for boats sailing from the Sea of Japan to the Sea of Okhotsk, e.g. from Vanino to Magadan. However, according to the SASCO that operates that shipping line, their ships rarely travel that way. The usual winter route from Vanino to Magadan is via Tsugaru Strait, and around Hokkaido; the usual summer route, is via La Pérouse Strait and around Sakhalin. Only when coming back from Magadan to Vanino with a low load and in good weather would the ships travel along the shortest route, i.e., via the Amur Liman, Nevelskoy Strait, and the Strait of Tartary proper (which SASCO calls the &quot;Strait of Sakhalin&quot; – &quot;Sakhalinsky Proliv&quot;).

A tunnel under the strait, to provide a road and/or rail connection between Sakhalin and the mainland, was begun under Joseph Stalin, but abandoned incomplete after his death. Renewed calls for either a tunnel or a bridge have been made by politicians in recent years.
