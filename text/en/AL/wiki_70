<text>The First Anglo-Dutch War, or First Dutch War, was a naval conflict between the Commonwealth of England and the Dutch Republic. Largely caused by disputes over trade, it began with English attacks on Dutch merchant shipping, but expanded to vast fleet actions. Despite a series of victories in 1652 and 1653, the Commonwealth was unable to blockade Dutch trade, although English privateers inflicted serious losses on Dutch merchant shipping.

The economic damage eventually led to the Treaty of Westminster in 1654 where the Dutch were forced to make minor concessions to the Commonwealth. Both sides agreed to the exclusion of the House of Orange from the office of Stadtholder, but failed to resolve underlying commercial issues. In 1665, Dutch objections to the Navigation Acts and English concerns over their rival&#x27;s trading practices led to the Second Anglo-Dutch War.

==Background==
In the 16th century, England had supported the Dutch Republic in the Eighty Years&#x27; War against Spain. They cooperated in fighting the Spanish Armada and England supported the Dutch in the early part of the Eighty Years&#x27; War by sending money and troops and maintaining garrisons in key ports and a permanent English representative to the Dutch government to ensure coordination of the joint war effort, under the Treaty of Nonsuch. The separate peace in 1604 between England and Spain strained this relationship, although an Anglo-Dutch treaty of 1625, due to remain in force until 1640 was the basis of officially cordial relations between the two countries, and also formed the basis of Charles I of England&#x27;s Dutch policy.

The weakening of Spanish power at the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War in 1648 also meant that many colonial possessions of the Portuguese and some of the Spanish Empire and their mineral resources were effectively open to conquest by a stronger power. The ensuing rush for empire brought the former allies into conflict, and the Dutch, having made peace with Spain, quickly replaced the English as dominant traders with the Iberian Peninsula, adding to an English resentment about Dutch trade that had steadily grown since 1590. Although the Dutch wished to renew the 1625 treaty, their attempt to do so in 1639 was not responded to, so the treaty lapsed.

By the middle of the 17th century the Dutch had built by far the largest mercantile fleet in Europe, with more ships than all the other states combined, and their economy, based substantially on maritime commerce, gave them a dominant position in European trade, especially in the North Sea and Baltic. Furthermore, they had conquered most of Portugal&#x27;s territories and trading posts in the East Indies and Brazil, giving them control over the enormously profitable trade in spices. They were even gaining significant influence over England&#x27;s trade with her as yet small North American colonies.

The economic disparity between England and the United Provinces increased in part because unlike the English, the Dutch system was based on free trade, making their products more competitive. For example, an English wool trader, who dealt largely with ports in English-speaking America, complained in 1651 that although his English ships would take wool cloth to America to be sold, they could expect to leave American ports with 4,000 to 5,000 bags of wool cloth unsold. Dutch ships, on the other hand, would leave American ports with barely 1,000 bags of wool cloth unsold. Because of this disparity, English trade with her traditional markets in the Baltic, Germany, Russia and Scandinavia withered. During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, the States General was officially neutral, a policy that antagonised both Parliamentarians and Royalists but which the powerful province of Holland considered most advantageous.

The Dutch also benefitted from the 1648 Peace of Münster which confirmed their independence from Spain and ended the Eighty Years&#x27; War, although the Imperial Diet did not formally accept that the Dutch Republic was no longer part of the Holy Roman Empire until 1728. The peace agreement&#x27;s provisions included a monopoly over trade conducted through the Scheldt estuary, confirming the commercial ascendancy of Amsterdam; Antwerp, part of the Spanish Netherlands and before 1585 the most important port in Northern Europe, would not recover until the late 19th century. This translated into cheaper prices for Dutch products due to a steep and sustained drop in freight charges and insurance rates.

Following the outbreak of the First English Civil War in August 1642, Parliamentarians and Royalists placed an embargo on Dutch ships trading with the opposing side. Since the vast majority of English ports were held by Parliament and the Royalist navy was weak, few Dutch ships were seized although the number steadily rose from 1644 to 1646, causing considerable tension. Despite these embargoes and their extension to Ireland and English colonies in Royalist hands, as late as 1649 the States General, and particularly the maritime provinces of Holland and Zeeland, wished to maintain their lucrative trade with England. Until 1648, Dutch naval vessels also inspected convoys of English ships which, as neutrals, were able to trade with the Spanish Netherlands. They sometimes brought ships into Dutch ports for more thorough examination and, very rarely, confiscated ships and cargoes as contraband.

The Execution of Charles I in January 1649 resulted in the formation of the Commonwealth of England, which continued to fight Royalists at home and in some of their colonies, leading to an expansion in the English Navy. At the same time, the war played havoc with English trading and shipping. To broadly study their commercial condition, the first Commission of Trade to be established by an Act of Parliament was erected on 1 August 1650. In October 1650, as part of the act to subdue their Royalist colonies and prevent Royalists from fleeing England, Parliament prohibited foreign ships from visiting or trading with any English plantations in America, without license; the act also allowed the seizure of ships violating the prohibition by both the English navy and merchant ships. The act was a temporary war measure hastily enacted and, while it was enacted in general terms to include all countries, it was aimed primarily at the Dutch, and was superseded the following year by a carefully prepared Navigation Act. Writing a century later, Adam Anderson relates of the period that &quot;It had been observed with concern, that the merchants of England for several years past had usually freighted the Hollanders shipping for bringing home their own merchandize, because their freight was at a lower rate than that of English ships. The Dutch shipping were thereby made use of even for importing our own American products; whilst our shipping lay rotting in our harbours; our mariners also for want of employment at home, went into the service of the Hollanders.&quot; The English accused the Dutch of profiting from the turmoil of the English Civil War.

===Opposing fleets===
The Dutch fleet in the Eighty Years&#x27; War had three tasks: as a Battle Force against major Spanish fleets, to convoy Dutch merchant ships and protect its fishing fleet and to actively oppose privateers, particularly those of Dunkirk. In that war, the two latter tasks were more important than major fleet actions, and they required more numerous but smaller warships than the Battle Force, although these smaller ships could also be used in mêlée battles, where boarding rather than gunfire might decide the result. Following their victory over the Spanish fleet at the Battle of the Downs on October 21, 1639, and after peace was made with Spain in 1648, the need for major warships lessened, although smaller ones were still required for convoy service, particularly to the Mediterranean, the East Indies and later to the Caribbean. The financially exhausted Dutch Admiralties allowed their squadrons, and particularly their major warships, to deteriorate.

In the period up to the First Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch Republic had four sources of warships. The first was the ships of five autonomous Admiralties (&quot;colleges&quot;), three in the province of Holland, which were supported by local taxes on commerce and contributions from the inland provinces. Each Admiralty was responsible for the design, construction, armament and manning of its own ships and the appointment of flag officers for its squadron. The second was the so-called &quot;director&#x27;s ships&quot; (&quot;directieschepen&quot;), convoy escorts provided by the burgomasters and merchants of six cities including Amsterdam and Hoorn to protect their Baltic trades. The cities were responsible for providing what were in effect modified and armed merchant ships, appointing their captains and providing crews. The next group were hybrid ships of the Dutch East India Company, which could act as warships or cargo carriers and the last were hired merchant vessels, whose owners had little interest in risking their property. Although captains of the East India Company were generally competent, they were unused to naval discipline, as were the more variable in quality commanders of director&#x27;s ships and hired merchant ships.

After 1648 the Admiralties sold off many of their larger ships, including Dutch Admiral Maarten Tromp&#x27;s own flagship, the &quot;Aemilia&quot;, of 600 tons and fitted with 57 guns. Admiral Tromp was forced to shift his flag to the 600-ton &quot;Brederode&quot;, of 54 guns. By 1652, the Dutch Admiralties had only 79 ships at their disposal. Many of these ships were in bad repair, with fewer than 50 being seaworthy. All these ships were inferior in firepower to the largest English first and second rate ships. The numerical deficiency in the Dutch navy was to be made up by arming merchantmen.

The strongest restraint on the number of sailing warships was the large crews required, so fleets were limited by the number of seaman that could be induced or compelled to serve. England had a greater population and employed impressment to make up crew numbers, so could generally maintain more fully crewed ships than the Dutch could. The Dutch partly compensated by hiring foreign sailors from Scandinavia and the Baltic. The English navy of the Commonwealth period was in better condition and was still improving. The Commonwealth had won the English Civil War in 1652 with a strong and effective navy that had supported and supplied Cromwell&#x27;s army in the wars in Scotland and Ireland; blockaded the Royalist fleet of Prince Rupert in Lisbon; and organised a system of convoys to protect the commerce of the Commonwealth against the numerous privateers based in European ports.

Compared to the Dutch fleet, the English fleet had larger ships of the first and second rates, but proportionately fewer frigates, as the English fleet was principally designed to fight in major actions, whilst providing convoy escorts or fighting privateers was a secondary task. The first and second rate ships included the ageing &quot;Resolution&quot; and which dated from James I&#x27;s reign, along with the &quot;Sovereign&quot; and others from Charles I&#x27;s navy. However, the &quot;Naseby&quot;, &quot;Richard&quot;, &quot;Dunbar&quot;, and several others were built during the Commonwealth. These were part of a naval expansion financed by an Act of Parliament on 10 November 1650 which imposed a 15% tax on merchant shipping. Between 1649 and 1651 the English fleet included 18 ships that were each superior in firepower to Dutch Admiral Tromp&#x27;s new flagship &quot;Brederode&quot;, the largest Dutch ship. All the English ships intended to fight in the battle line were more heavily armed than their equivalents in other European navies, sacrificing freeboard and the ability to use their lower guns in adverse weather in exchange for more powerful ordnance. English ships could fire and hit the enemy at a greater range, and favoured the use of round shot over the chain shot which was popular in other navies.

===Political tensions===
The commercial tensions between England and the Netherlands were intensified when the English Parliament passed the Navigation Act 1651. This limited Dutch trade with any of the English colonies in America unless the shipping was done in &quot;English bottoms&quot; i.e. English ships. Indeed, any cargo to English ports or the ports of English colonies from anywhere in the world was required to be carried in English ships. Furthermore, the Navigation Act forbade all trade with those English colonies that retained connections and sympathy for the royalist cause of Charles I. To have accepted the terms of the Navigation Act was seen by the Dutch as agreeing to subordinate Dutch trade to the English trading system. This insulted Dutch pride and damaged their economy, but the more immediate cause of the war was the actions of the English navy and privateers against Dutch shipping. In 1651, 140 Dutch merchantmen were seized on the open seas. During January 1652 alone, another 30 Dutch ships were captured at sea and taken to English ports. Protests to England by the States General of the United Provinces were of no avail: the English Parliament showed no inclination toward curbing these seizures of Dutch shipping.

During the English Civil War, the Dutch Stadtholder Frederick Henry had given significant financial support to Charles I of England, to whom he had close family ties. The States General had been generally neutral and refused to become involved with representatives of either king or parliament; it also attempted to mediate between the two sides, an attitude that offended both English Royalists and its parliament. Frederick Henry&#x27;s influence was lessening with the growth of strongly republican sentiment among the ruling class, and he could not involve the Netherlands in direct support for Charles I, particularly as his country was still at war with Spain.

After the death of Frederick Henry in March 1647, his son, stadtholder William II of Orange, attempted to extend the power of the stadtholderate particularly through maintaining the size of the army, which he commanded and using his supporters in six provinces to outvote Holland, the most prosperous province, in the States General. Following the end of the Eighty Years&#x27; War and the execution of his father-in-law, Charles I, William attempted to support the English Royalist cause to an extent that gave concern to even his own followers, and which involved him in disputes with the more committed republicans, particularly those in Holland. The execution of Charles outraged the Orangists, and the Dutch republicans that had attempted to save Charles&#x27; life, but the execution did not prevent the States General from continuing a policy of broad neutrality, dealing unofficially with the English parliament while allowing Royalist envoys into the country. The Commonwealth and the Dutch Republic had many things in common: they were both republican and Protestant and many members of States General sympathised with the aims of the English parliamentarians and, while strongly against its regicide, supported a pragmatic policy of neutrality, in opposition to the Royalist-supporting stadtholder. The impasse between the two sides ended with the sudden death of William II in November 1650. His attempts to involve the Netherlands in action against the English Commonwealth in support of the exiled Charles II could have led at least to limited hostilities and possibly outright war and lead to a republican reaction. Shortly before his death, William attempted to gain control of Amsterdam by a coup, and then imprisoned six leading members of the States of Holland, but they were released when he died. These six led the province of Holland to assume the leadership of the republican movement, the Loevestein faction, which saw the Netherlands as a free republic without a stadholder. The resulting First Stadtholderless period began when William II died in 1650, although it was not until January 1651 that the last of the seven provinces agreed to it.

===English delegation to The Hague===
As early as 1643, Oliver St John had urged fellow Protestants in the Netherlands to sign the Solemn League and Covenant that the Scots had already signed, but had been rebuffed. After the execution of Charles I in 1649, parliament sent an envoy to the Hague to discuss an alliance with the United Provinces, but he was murdered shortly after his arrival in reprisal for the king&#x27;s death, after which the proposal was left in abeyance until more favourable times. The sudden death on 6 November 1650 of William II, the Stadholder of the United Provinces, whose popularity had declined since his election in 1647 in the face of growing discontent from the States Party in the United Provinces, changed matters. The States party was the political faction identified most closely with the idea of rule solely by the States General, and was especially powerful in the large commercially oriented province of Holland. To obtain support against William II, it had sought the assistance of Oliver Cromwell. After William II&#x27;s death, the States Party was in a much stronger position politically, and no longer valued or needed Cromwell&#x27;s support against the stadholderate.

In January 1651, the English Council of State, aware that the Netherlands States General was about to recognise the Commonwealth as the legitimate English government, which it did on 28 January, prepared an embassy to the republic headed by Oliver St John, with two envoys extraordinary. When it arrived in The Hague on 7 March 1651, the English delegation made it clear that their aim was to &quot;enter into a more strict and intimate alliance and union&#x27; with the republic&quot; to be effected by &quot;a Confederation of the two Commonwealths&quot;. and based on proposal put in 1648 by a parliamentary envoy that the Dutch had declined to consider. Any Dutch expectation that recognising the Commonwealth would end dissent between the two countries was disabused and, based on the earlier proposal, the States General drew up a draft of 36 articles, the first eleven of which were the subject of intensive discussion. By June the Dutch believed that agreement had been reached on those points, and the English delegation announced their imminent departure, leaving on 2 July.

During their three-month stay, other events had convinced the English delegation of Dutch animosity. The Hague was the residence of the young widow of William II, Charles I&#x27;s daughter Mary Henrietta Stuart, the Princess Royal. Her presence attracted exiled English noblemen not fighting with her brother Charles to The Hague, which had for many years been an Orangist stronghold. The delegation appointed by the Commonwealth, could only leave their lodgings under armed escort, for fear of being assaulted by Royalists or large Orangist mobs in their pay. When the English delegates left in the last week of June, they reported that the Dutch were untrustworthy and that the United Provinces were under the control of the Orangist party and thus a threat to the security of the Commonwealth. Although the States of Holland and West Friesland were unwilling, if not unable, to suppress the activities of English Royalists, Orangists that deplored the execution of Charles I, and certain strict Calvinist ministers opposing Cromwell&#x27;s religious innovations, it would have been more logical for him to ally with the ruling republican regents to overcome the pro-Stuart Orangists than go to war, were economic issues not more pressing.

Following the departure of St John, the States General sent a delegation to London to continue discussions. However, after the Battle of Worcester in September 1651, the radical element in the English parliament became stronger and the group including Cromwell that genuinely favoured an alliance with the Netherlands was outnumbered by those wanting either to cripple Dutch trade without going to war or to provoke a war with the Dutch republic for political reasons. The Dutch considered that the economic provisions of the 36 articles they had drafted could form the basis of a trade agreement without compromising the independence of the United Provinces or their becoming involved in a war with Spain, but it soon became apparent that the English negotiators were most concerned to ensure Dutch action against English Royalists and restrictions on the Dutch carrying trade between third countries. The armed confrontation between Tromp and Blake off Dover took place before these issues were settled, and the English immediately halted negotiations and refused to reopen them when the Dutch offered concessions, preferring war.

===Path to war===
In England, after 1648 and more particularly after Charles&#x27; execution and the proclamation of the Commonwealth, the army assumed a more prominent political role compared with parliament.

The neutralisation of Rupert&#x27;s fleet and its bases, the defeat of the Irish Royalists at Rathmines and Drogheda in 1649 and of the Scots at the Battle of Dunbar in 1650 made the Commonwealth more assertive in its relations with the Dutch, both on trade and on William II&#x27;s support for the Stuart cause. French support for the English Royalists had led the Commonwealth to commence the issuing of letters of marque against French ships and against French goods in neutral ships in December 1649. Dozens of neutral Dutch ships were detained near French ports by English ships operating under letters of marque, and some of these were seized. Dutch concerns were further raised by an English embargo on Dutch trade with Scotland declared soon after.

In 1649 and 1650, General-at-Sea Robert Blake drove the Royalist fleet under Prince Rupert from its bases in Ireland and pursued it to the port of Lisbon, where it was protected by the harbour&#x27;s forts and the Portuguese king&#x27;s refusal to let Blake enter the port. The Council of State decided to reinforce Blake and authorised him to seize ships from Brazil in reprisal, and to withdraw the English envoy to Portugal, whose departure in July 1650 created a state of war. In response to the Portuguese failure to expel Rupert, Blake continued to seize merchant ships entering the River Tagus from Brazil. On 24 September 1650 Blake attacked a fleet of 23 merchant vessels from Brazil and their naval escort, sinking the Portuguese Admiral and capturing the Vice-Admiral and ten of the larger merchant ships. The Portuguese court were compelled to insist that Rupert leave Lisbon harbour in September 1650, but after finding Blake waiting for him, Rupert placed his ships under the protection of Portuguese coastal forts, where he remained until December, when he escaped to the West Indies. The threat of the Royalist fleet had been neutralised by forcing it into retreat. Its strongholds in the Isles of Scilly, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands were captured in 1651. This was followed in 1652 by the recovery of England&#x27;s colonial possessions in the West Indies and North America by General George Ayscue.

Infuriated by the treatment of the English delegation in the Hague and emboldened by their victory against Charles II and his forces at the Battle of Worcester on September 3, 1651, the English Parliament, as noted above, passed the first of the Navigation Acts in October 1651. It ordered that only English ships and ships from the originating country could import goods to England. This measure, as also noted above, was particularly aimed at hampering the shipping of the highly trade-dependent Dutch and often used as a pretext simply to take their ships; as General Monck put it: &quot;The Dutch have too much trade, and the English are resolved to take it from them.&quot; Agitation among the Dutch merchants was further increased by George Ayscue&#x27;s capture in early 1652 of 27 Dutch ships trading with the Royalist colony of Barbados in contravention of the trade prohibition imposed by the Commonwealth. Over a hundred other Dutch ships were captured by English privateers between October 1651 and July 1652. Moreover, the death of Dutch Stadtholder William II, who had favoured an expansion of the army at the expense of the navy, had led to a change in Dutch defence policy towards protecting the great trading concerns of Amsterdam and Rotterdam. Accordingly, the States General decided on 3 March 1652 to expand the fleet by hiring and equipping 150 merchant ships as ships of war to allow effective convoying against hostile English actions. Although the States of Holland stressed that this measure was intended defensive and it carefully selected its captains and issued prudent instructions about saluting English warships, when news of this decision reached London on 12 March 1652, it was seen as a provocative move.

==War==
The Commonwealth began to prepare for war, but as both nations were unready, war might have been delayed if not for an unfortunate encounter between the fleets of Dutch Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp and General at Sea Robert Blake in the English Channel near Dover on 29 May 1652. An ordinance of Cromwell required all foreign fleets in the North Sea or the Channel to dip their flag in salute, reviving an ancient right the English had long insisted on. Tromp himself was fully aware of the need to give this mark of courtesy, but partly through a misunderstanding and partly out of resentment among the seamen, it was not given promptly, and Blake opened fire, starting the brief Battle of Dover. Tromp lost two ships but escorted his convoy to safety.

The States of Holland sent their highest official, the Grand Pensionary Adriaan Pauw, to London in a last desperate attempt to prevent war, but in vain: English demands had become so extreme that no self-respecting state could meet them. War was declared by the English Parliament on 10 July 1652. The Dutch diplomats realised what was at stake: one of the departing ambassadors said, &quot;The English are about to attack a mountain of gold; we are about to attack a mountain of iron.&quot; The Dutch Orangists were jubilant however; they expected that either victory or defeat would bring them to power.

The first months of the war saw English attacks against the Dutch convoys. Blake was sent with 60 ships to disrupt Dutch fishing in the North Sea and Dutch trade with the Baltic, leaving Ayscue with a small force to guard the Channel. On 12 July 1652, Ayscue intercepted a Dutch convoy returning from Portugal, capturing seven merchantmen and destroying three. Tromp gathered a fleet of 96 ships to attack Ayscue, but southerly winds kept him in the North Sea. Turning north to pursue Blake, Tromp caught up with the English fleet off the Shetland Islands, but a storm scattered his ships and there was no battle. On 26 August 1652, an outward-bound Dutch convoy with an escort of director&#x27;s ships from Zeeland commanded by Michiel de Ruyter, who held the rank of &quot;commandeur&quot;, broadly equivalent to commodore was sighted by Ayscue, with a more numerous squadron of warships and armed merchant ships. Ayscue attempted to attack the convoy with around nine of his strongest and fastest warships, but De Ruyter counter-attacked and, in the Battle of Plymouth, surrounded the English warships which were not supported by their armed merchant ships. The convoy escaped, Ayscue was relieved of his command and de Ruyter gained prestige in his first independent command.

Tromp had also been suspended after the failure in Shetland, and Vice-Admiral Witte de With was given command. The Dutch convoys being at the time safe from English attack, De With saw an opportunity to concentrate his forces and gain control of the seas. At the Battle of the Kentish Knock on 8 October 1652 the Dutch attacked the English fleet near the mouth of the River Thames, but were beaten back with many casualties. The English Parliament, believing the Dutch to be near defeat, sent away twenty ships to strengthen the position in the Mediterranean. This division of forces left Blake with only 42 men of war by November, while the Dutch were making every effort to reinforce their fleet. This division led to an English defeat by Tromp in the Battle of Dungeness in December, while it failed to save the English Mediterranean fleet, largely destroyed at the Battle of Leghorn in March 1653.

The Dutch had effective control of the Channel, the North Sea, and the Mediterranean, with English ships blockaded in port. As a result, Cromwell convinced Parliament to begin secret peace negotiations with the Dutch. In February 1653, Adriaan Pauw responded favourably, sending a letter from the States of Holland indicating their sincere desire to reach a peace agreement. However, these discussions, which were only supported by a bare majority of members of the Rump parliament, dragged on without much progress for almost a year.

Though the politicians were close to ending the conflict, the naval war continued and, over the winter of 1652–53, the English fleet repaired its ships and considered its tactics. All of the sea battles fought in 1652 were chaotic, with boarding and capturing enemy ships a favoured tactic, particularly of the Dutch. Squadrons or even individual ships fought without regard to the rest of the fleet, although the English fleet instructions of 1650 emphasised the importance of supporting other ships of the same squadron, particularly the flagship. In the first major battle of 1653, the English fleet challenged the Dutch in the three-day Battle of Portland, which began in 28 February. They captured at least 20 Dutch merchant ships, captured or destroyed at least eight and possibly twelve warships and drove the Dutch from the Channel. Like the battles of 1652, this was chaotic, but the most notable tactical events happened in the first day, when Tromp led the whole Dutch fleet against about two dozen English ships at the rear of the fleet, hoping to overpower them before the bulk of the English fleet could come to their aid. However, the outnumbered English ships extemporised a line ahead formation and managed to keep the Dutch at bay through coordinated heavy gunfire.

Whether as a direct result of the Battle of Portland or the accumulation of experience gained over some years, in March 1653, Robert Blake wrote the Sailing and Fighting Instructions, a major overhaul of English naval tactics, containing the first formal description of the line of battle. The success of this new formation was evident in the Battle of the Gabbard in June 1653, when the English fleet not only defeated the Dutch in a long-range artillery duel but suffered so little damage that it could maintain a blockade rather than sending many ships to port for repairs. The Dutch, in contrast, relied less on linear tactics, preferring to close with English ships to board and capture then as late as the Battle of Lowestoft in 1665, and they also retained numbers of slow and badly armed hired merchant ships in their fleet as late as that battle, when the English fleet was already questioning their use.

In mid-March 1653, the States of Holland sent a detailed peace proposal to the English &quot;Rump Parliament&quot;, where it generated a fierce debate and a slim majority for a response to be made. The response made first to the States of Holland and then to the States General in April was critical of the Dutch proposals, but at least allowed discussions to start. Little was achieved until both the Rump Parliament and its short-lived successor the Nominated Parliament had been dissolved, the latter in December 1653. The following month the States General asked for negotiations to be restarted and in May Cromwell agreed to receive Dutch envoys in London. In mid June, Johan de Witt persuaded the States General to send commissioners to London to negotiate peace terms and Cromwell was receptive, although he was insistent that the Dutch republic must ensure the House of Orange would not become dominant again, and declined to repeal the Navigation Act.

Cromwell again put forward his plan for a political union between the two nations to the four Dutch envoys who had arrived in London in late June, but they emphatically rejected this. He also wished to avoid further conflict with the Dutch Republic, as it was planning war with Spain. Cromwell then proposed a military alliance against Spain, promising to repeal the Navigation Act in return for Dutch assistance in the conquest of Spanish America: this too was rejected. Cromwell then fell back on a proposal of 27 articles, two of which were unacceptable to the Dutch: that all Royalists had to be expelled, and that Denmark, the ally of the Republic, should be abandoned in its war against Sweden. In the end Cromwell accepted that the 25 agreed articles would form the basis for peace.

Meanwhile, the English navy tried to gain control over the North Sea, and in the two-day Battle of the Gabbard in June drove the Dutch back to their home ports with the loss of 17 warships captured or destroyed, starting a blockade of the Dutch coast, which led to a crippling of the Dutch economy. The Dutch were unable to feed their dense urban population without a regular supply of Baltic wheat and rye; prices of these commodities soared and the poor were soon unable to buy food, and starvation ensued.

The final battle of the war was the hard-fought and bloody Battle of Scheveningen in August, fought because the Dutch were desperate to break the English blockade. This was a tactical victory for the English fleet, which captured or destroyed at least a dozen and possibly 27 Dutch warships for the loss of two or three English ones, and captured or killed some 2,000 men including Tromp, who was killed early in the battle, for a loss of 500 English dead. However, despite their heavy losses of men and ships, the Dutch fleet was able to retreat to the Texel, and the English had to abandon their blockade, so the Dutch achieved their aim. The death of Tromp was a blow to Dutch morale, which increased the Dutch desire to end the war: similar feelings arose in England. Although many had been enriched by the war, trade as a whole had suffered. However, in September, the Dutch fleet, under Witte de With, was able to resume its operations. It successfully disembarked 400 merchant ships and returned with an equivalent number, all carrying valuable goods from the East Indies, which demonstrated the reopening of the sea routes.

Allied with Denmark and maintaining a formidable presence at the Danish Sound, the Dutch effectively put an end to English trade in the Baltic region. Throughout 1653, not a single English vessel passed through the Sound. In the Mediterranean, the Dutch had achieved similar success. Additionally, in the East Indies, the Dutch East India Company had swiftly established maritime dominance, spanning from the Persian Gulf to the South China Sea. The English agent at Livorno, Charles Longland, reported to London, that the Dutch had been heavily defeated in home waters but added &quot;yet our losses here have been so visible to all Europe, Asia and Africa that they will not believe but that our condition is as bad at home.&quot; After Scheveningen, the Dutch also turned to using smaller warships and commerce raiding with the result that, by November Cromwell, despite military success in the North Sea, was anxious to make peace as the Dutch were capturing numerous English merchant ships.

Despite this the Dutch Republic was also unable to sustain a prolonged naval war as English privateers inflicted serious damage on Dutch shipping. At the time the Dutch merchant fleet was three times larger than the English, and it is estimated that the Dutch lost between 1,000 and 1,700 vessels (the most reliable estimate is from Amsterdam Burgomasters who claimed the Dutch lost 1,200) of all sizes to privateers in this war. This accounted for 8% of the total Dutch mercantile fleet, amounted to double the value of England&#x27;s entire ocean-going merchant fleet. These losses were three to four times as many as the English lost (440 ships in total), and more than the total Dutch losses for the other two Anglo-Dutch wars in the 17th century. This was the greatest single maritime disaster suffered by the Dutch world Entrepôt during its great age. In addition, as press-ganging was forbidden, enormous sums had to be paid to attract enough sailors to man the fleet. The Dutch were unable to defend all of their colonies and it had too few colonists or troops in Dutch Brazil to prevent the more numerous Portuguese, dissatisfied by Dutch rule, from reconquest. In Holland itself the war took its toll – shipping businesses had ceased trading and work was hard to find. In Amsterdam fifteen hundred houses were untenanted, many observed a large number of roaming beggars and grass was growing in the streets. The condition of the country had left the Dutch no choice but to accept Cromwells terms.

Peace negotiations continued until March 1654 when Cromwell demanded a change in that the then-four-year-old Prince of Orange should be excluded from future government appointments, like the stadtholderate, or the captaincy-general of the States Army. This was at first rejected, but the Dutch eventually accepted, and Peace was declared on 15 April 1654 with the signing of the Treaty of Westminster and ratified by all parties by 22 April.

==Aftermath==
The Dutch were saved from harsh peace. In part to the leniency of Cromwell, but also because he feared a longer war, along with the massive economic damage to the English maritime economy. The Dutch nevertheless realized few of the objectives in their 36 articles, and had to make a few minor concessions - the acceptance of the Act of Navigation which excluded their merchants from all commerce between England and its colonies, an indemnity of £85,000 for losses of the EIC in the East Indies and £3,615 which had to be paid to the heirs of the victims of the Amboyna massacre. The island of Run in the East Indies was to be ceded to the East India Company, although the Dutch never actually returned the island. Lastly, a symbolic gesture; saluting the flag of English warships in the Channel.

Cromwell&#x27;s original political aim of a union that would subordinate the Dutch was dropped; instead the main concession which he desired bore no role in the original reason for going to war. This was the sole condition that the Dutch had to agree that no Prince of Orange or other member of the House of Orange should hold the office of Stadtholder or any other public office in the Netherlands, a demand that was strongly opposed by Orangists, but in the interests of the Dutch States Party, led by Johan de Witt. Although this was not part of the formal peace treaty, the two members of the negotiating team from the province of Holland agreed to a secret annexe providing that England would only ratify the treaty after the States of Holland had passed an Act of Seclusion, excluding the House of Orange from holding public office in that province: this legislation was passed in May 1654. There was an adverse reaction from several of the other Dutch provinces, but their provincial assemblies could neither overcome their own internal divisions nor coordinate opposition with other provinces. However, although they did not enact their own Exclusion legislation then, in practice they did not oppose it. Only after the Second Anglo-Dutch War did four other provinces besides Holland adopt the Perpetual Edict (1667) sanctioning Exclusion.

England celebrated the peace but it was also a relief - Cromwell proclaimed 23 May 1654 to be a day of Thanksgiving. The English made some small gains out of the peace treaty, while not making any concessions to the Dutch, but the strong commercial position of the Dutch Republic remained largely intact and the rivalry between the two nations was not resolved. Especially in their emerging overseas colonies, hostilities continued between Dutch and English trading companies, which had warships and troops of their own.

The English soon took advantage of their new ships seized from the Dutch to implement a merchant fleet on similar lines to the Dutch, particularly the effort to build more flyboats. The Dutch too had started on a major shipbuilding programme to remedy the lack of ships of the line evident at the battles of the Kentish Knock, the Gabbard, and Scheveningen. The admiralties were now forbidden by law to sell off these sixty new ships. When in 1665 the Second Anglo-Dutch War started the Dutch were thus much better prepared.

<text>Maarten Harpertszoon Tromp or Maarten van Tromp (23 April 1598 – 31 July 1653) was an army general and admiral in the Dutch navy during much of the Eighty Years&#x27; War and throughout the First Anglo-Dutch War. Son of a ship&#x27;s captain, Tromp spent much of his childhood at sea, during which time he was captured by pirates and enslaved by Barbary corsairs. In adult life, he became a renowned ship captain and naval commander, successfully leading Dutch forces fighting for independence in the Eighty Years&#x27; War, and then against England in the First Anglo-Dutch War, proving an innovative tactician and enabling the newly independent Dutch nation to become a major sea power. He was killed in battle by a sharpshooter from an English ship. Several ships of the Royal Netherlands Navy have carried the name HNLMS &quot;Tromp&quot; after him and/or his son Cornelis, also a Dutch admiral of some renown.

==Early life==
Born in Brielle in the Netherlands, Tromp was the oldest son of Harpert Maertensz, a naval officer and captain of the frigate &quot;Olifantstromp (&quot;Elephant Trunk&quot;)&quot;. The surname &quot;Tromp&quot; probably derives from the name of the ship; it first appeared in documents in 1607. He was baptized 3 May 1598 in St. Catherine&#x27;s Cathedral. In 1606, the Tromp family moved to Rotterdam where Tromp&#x27;s father was appointed by the Admiralty of Rotterdam as captain of the frigate &quot;Olifantstromp&quot;. His mother supplemented the family&#x27;s income as a washerwoman. In 1607, at the age of nine, Tromp went to sea with his father aboard the &quot;Olifantsdorp&quot;, of the Rotterdam squadron, commanded by Commodore Mooy Lambert, as part of the Dutch fleet of Lieutenant-Admiral Jacob van Heemskerck, with the objective of blockading Dunkirk and the Spanish coast and intercepting the Spanish fleet being sent to drive the Dutch from the East Indies. On 25 April, a fierce battle ensued at the Battle of Gibraltar, resulting in a great Dutch victory.

In 1610, after his father&#x27;s discharge because of a navy reorganization, the Tromps were on their way to Guinea on their merchantman when they were attacked by a squadron of seven ships under command of the English pirate Peter Easton. During the fight, Tromp&#x27;s father was slain by a cannonball, where after the battle his body was thrown overboard by the boarding party. According to legend, the 12-year-old boy rallied the crew of the ship with the cry &quot;Won&#x27;t you avenge my father&#x27;s death?&quot; The pirates seized him and sold him on the slave market of Salé where he ended up serving as a cabin boy. Two years later, Easton was moved by pity and ordered his redemption.

Set free, Tromp supported his mother and three sisters by working in a Rotterdam shipyard. He went to sea again at 19, briefly working for the navy, but he was captured again in 1621 after having rejoined the merchant fleet, this time by Barbary corsairs off Tunis. He was kept as a slave until the age of 24 and by then had so impressed the Bey of Tunis and the corsair John Ward with his skills in gunnery and navigation that the latter offered him a position in his fleet. When Tromp refused, the Bey was even more impressed by this show of character and allowed him to leave as a free man in 1622.

==Naval career==
Maarten Tromp was supreme commander of the Dutch fleet during the later part of the Eighty Years&#x27; War and throughout the First Anglo-Dutch War. He is widely considered the best Dutch naval commander during most of this time. Tromp&#x27;s former superior, Admiral Piet Pieterszoon Hein, once told a friend that Tromp as a seaman and a commander possessed a sound character that distinguished him from all the captains he had ever known. Tromp joined the Dutch navy as a lieutenant in July 1622, entering service with the Admiralty of the Maze based in Rotterdam, serving aboard the &quot;Bruynvisch&quot;. On 7 May 1624, he married Dignom Cornelisdochter de Haes, the daughter of a merchant; in the same year he became captain of the &quot;St. Antonius&quot;, a fast sailing dispatch and escort yacht. His first distinction was as Lieutenant-Admiral Hein&#x27;s flag captain on the &quot;Vliegende Groene Draeck&quot; during the fight with Ostend privateers in 1629 in which Hein was killed, after which Tromp returned home with his body.

===Eighty Years&#x27; War===
During the Eighty Years&#x27; War (1568–1648), Tromp was appointed as full captain in 1629 at the initiative of stadtholder Frederick Henry himself, where Tromp demonstrated that he was very successful in fighting the Dunkirkers as a squadron commander, functioning as a commandeur on the &quot;Vliegende Groene Draeck&quot;. Despite receiving four honorary golden chains, he was not promoted further. The &quot;Vliegende Groene Draeck&quot; foundered and new heavy vessels were reserved for the flag officers while Tromp was relegated to the old &quot;Prins Hendrik&quot;. After Tromp&#x27;s first wife died in 1634, with whom he had three sons left for Tromp to support, he subsequently left the naval service that year in disappointment. He became a deacon and married Alijth Jacobsdochter Arckenboudt, the daughter of Brill&#x27;s wealthy schepen and tax collector, on 12 September 1634.
In 1637 Tromp re-enlisted in the Dutch navy and was promoted from captain to Lieutenant-Admiral of Holland and West Frisia, under the Stadtholder, Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange. This occurred following the resignation of Lieutenant-Admiral Philips van Dorp, and the dismissal of Vice-Admiral Jasper Liefhebber, and other flag officers due to incompetence, neglecting the Dutch navy which had fallen into a deplorable state, with several captains resigning their commissions and seeking service with the army. With the resignation of van Dorp on 27 October the States of Holland once again asked Tromp to accept the command of the Dutch navy. Tromp accepted but under the conditions that afforded him greater authority than was allowed for the navy’s previous commanders, remembering how badly the fleet had been neglected by them under van Dorp. Tromp insisted on a greater number of ships, which were to be well outfitted with supplies, and well manned. The States gave Tromp their solemn promise that they would grant all his requests. The terms of Tromp’s official appointment from the Stadtholder further strengthened his position. Witte de With, a year younger, very brave but brutal and ill-tempered, was appointed as his vice-admiral. Both were born in Den Briel and served as flag captains under Piet Hein. Although formally ranking under the Admiral-General Frederick Henry of Orange, he was the &quot;de facto&quot; supreme commander of the Dutch fleet, as the stadtholders never fought at sea. Tromp was mostly occupied with blockading the privateer port of Dunkirk.

With his flagship, the &quot;Aemilia&quot;, Tromp promptly re-established the neglected blockade of Dunkirk and took steps to hinder the transportation of Spanish troops to Flanders. Tromp out-maneuvered Oquendo&#x27;s fleet which was bound for Flanders but was forced to retreat to England at the Downs, behind the sandbanks of the Kentish coast, where they remained trapped, while a prolonged debate preceding the Wars of the Three Kingdoms continued in London. Tromp was already familiar with the channel from his cruising during 1637 and 1638, and sailed to Calais Roads, blocking the southwestern entrance of Dunkirk, where he resupplied his fleet from Calais with the support of Cardinal Richelieu. Now with a reinforced fleet Tromp, in spite of the objection of Charles I, who was on good terms with the Spain. attacked on 21 October, during the Battle of the Downs, destroying a large proportion of Oquendo&#x27;s armada. During the Fight in the Channel, a preliminary action to the Downs, Tromp was the first fleet commander known for the deliberate use of line of battle tactics, marking the end of Spanish naval power. For his landmark victory Tromp was rewarded by the States-General and knighted by Louis XIII of France, a close Dutch ally in the war against Spain. Shortly thereafter his second wife died. Tromp married again in 1640, to Cornelia van Berckhout.
In 1643 the deputy of parliament in Holland made a loud protest in the General Assembly against the Prince of Orange for his orders to Tromp to allow two of the frigates bought by English royalists in Dunkirk, for his use and command.

During his career, his main rival was Vice-Admiral Witte de With, who also served the Admiralty of Rotterdam (de Maze) from 1637. De With temporarily replaced him as supreme commander for the Battle of Kentish Knock. Tromp&#x27;s crew would not permit De With, who had a reputation of severity when disciplining a crew, to raise his flag on their ship, and insisted that he use the &quot;Prins Willem&quot; as his flagship. Tromp&#x27;s successor was Lieutenant-Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam.

Tromp commanded the Dutch squadron that escorted Queen Henrietta Maria in 1643 when she returned from the Hague to King Charles I. Opposed to her returning to England the Parliamentarian squadron under William Batten threatened to attack the Queen&#x27;s convoy when it landed at Bridlington but was thwarted by Tromp to withdraw.

===First Anglo-Dutch War===

In the First Anglo-Dutch War of 1652 to 1653, Tromp commanded the Dutch fleet in the battles of Dover, Dungeness, Portland, the Gabbard and Scheveningen.

Prior to the war, Oliver Cromwell and the Rump Parliament had issued an ordinance prohibiting foreign trade and requiring all foreign fleets in the North Sea or the Channel to lower their flag in salute and as a sign of compliance. A Dutch embassy was in London trying to negotiate a lifting of the Navigation Acts, but without much success.
On 19 May 1652, Tromp was cruising in the English Channel with a fleet of forty ships between Nieuport and the mouth of the Meuse River, with general orders to protect Holland&#x27;s commerce, while keeping watch over the English fleet who were searching and seizing Dutch merchant ships prior. British Admiral Robert Blake had recently seized seven richly laden Dutch merchant ships, off the coast of Fairlight. Blake was now lying in Dover Roads with fifteen ships, while eight others were anchored in Bourne in the Downs. When Tromp failed to lower his flag in salute, Blake, aboard his flagship the &quot;James&quot;, believing Tromp had just received orders from a dispatch ketch to commence battle, fired two warning shots, without ball. The Battle of Dover was begun when Tromp refused to strike his flag and instead hoisted a red battle flag in defiance, which prompted Blake to fire a third gun, hitting Tromp&#x27;s ship and wounding some crew members. This was followed with Tromp returning fire with a warning broadside from his flagship &quot;Brederode&quot;. Blake in turn fired a broadside and a five-hour battle ensued. The fighting continued until nightfall, where both sides withdrew, the battle having no distinct victor. Shortly after the battle a board of commissioners, which included Cromwell, after questioning witnesses, had concluded that Tromp had deliberately provoked hostilities. Subsequently Holland withdrew its three ambassadors from Westminster, and on 8 July 1652 England declared war against Holland.

Tromp, with a larger fleet than he had ordered for, sailed to the Downs and found that Blake had made it to the north-east coast, where he set sail for the Thames River. Near the mouth of the river he came upon an English squadron, commanded by Sir George Ayscough, who had the advantage of the weather gage, thus preventing Tromp from engaging effectively. Subsequently, Tromp decided to return to the Netherland coast, which was a decision that was not at all well received by the Dutch government, resulting in his removal from command, with Admiral de Ruyter taking his place.

On 8 October 1652, with Tromp&#x27;s command still in suspension, Dutch Vice-Admiral Witte de With underestimating Blake, with 60 ships, attempted an attack at the Battle of the Kentish Knock, but ended with Blake sending the defeated de With back to the Netherlands. Although de With was the more adept tactician, he was no match against Blake&#x27;s force that included the heavy English ships the &quot;Resolution&quot; and the &quot;Sovereign&quot;, the two largest war ships in the world at the time. The significance of De With&#x27;s defeat was received over-optimistically by the Council of State, leading them to assume that Blake now had control over the English Channel. The Council subsequently dispersed their fleets to protect English interests in the Baltic Sea, and Newcastle, while another fleet was sent to reinforce the squadron in the Mediterranean. This left Blake with about forty ships that were in anchor in the Downs, and a situation that was compounded by a lack of funds to pay for badly needed repairs and for the crews.

Subsequent to de With&#x27;s defeat, Tromp was reinstated as commander, on 8 May, which proved to be a big boost for Dutch navy morale, which was the highest it had been since he was dismissed months before in July. The Battle of Dungeness occurred on 30 November 1652, and proved to be the most important Dutch victory during the war, with Tromp&#x27;s fleet winning for the Dutch the temporary control of the English Channel. A great convoy of 300 merchant ships was ready to leave the Netherlands headed for the Bay of Biscay, accompanied by a large fleet of 73 warships and a small number of fireships which were sent in escort to protect it. Tromp was in command, with Jan Evertsen and De Ruyter as his subordinate commanders. Admiral Blake had seriously underestimated Dutch strength, possibly due to poor visibility, as his fleet was outnumbered, two-to-one. Blake, nevertheless, shadowed the Dutch fleet which was sailing parallel along the English coast towards Dungeness, with the coastline beginning to bend to the south. As the fleets were approaching Dungeness Point Blake&#x27;s fleet became pinned against the shore bringing the two fleets close together. Tromp subsequently hoisted the red battle-flag and advanced on Blake’s new flagship, the &quot;Triumph&quot;. The battle that developed involved only a part of the Dutch fleet as the winds were preventing the others from engaging in a timely fashion. The re was much hand-to-hand fighting that lasted until about 5:00 pm with the advance of nightfall, with the Dutch fleet prevailing, taking several British prizes, while Blake retreated to the mouth of the Thames. Tromp&#x27;s victory over the British prompted a marked turning point for the British navy.

The naval Battle of the Gabbard, took place on 2–3 June 1653, (12–13 June 1653 Gregorian calendar) off the coast of Suffolk, England near the Gabbard shoal. Tromp, aboad his flagship &quot;Brederode&quot; with Vice-admiral Witte de With aboard the &quot;Vrijheid&quot;, was in command of 98 ships and six fireships, divided in five squadrons, while Generals at Sea George Monck and Richard Deane were in command of 100 ships and five fireships, divided into three squadrons. Tromp&#x27;s fleet was organized mostly for mélée fighting and were largely crewed with soldiers for that purpose, while the English employed the use of superior firepower. Admiral Robert Blake joined the English fleet on 3 June. Though his fleet was very low on ammunition Tromp decided for a direct attack, but at the time the winds became almost still, leaving the Dutch fleet vulnerable in the face of superior enemy fire. Subsequently the Dutch lost seventeen ships to capture or sinking, while the English lost none. Deane was killed during the action. It was one of the most costly defeats ever suffered by the Dutch, leaving the English in control of the English Channel.
During the Battle of Scheveningen, the last battle of the war, on 31 July 1653, Tromp was killed by a sharpshooter in the rigging of William Penn&#x27;s ship. Tromp&#x27;s flagship, the &quot;Brederode&quot;, broke through the English line where an intense battle ensued, resulting in Tromp&#x27;s imminent death. Tromp&#x27;s last words were, &quot;It is all over, O Lord, be merciful to me and thy poor people.&quot; Members of his crew carried the mortally wounded Tromp below deck to his cabin, where he died only a moment later. His acting flag captain, Egbert Bartholomeusz Kortenaer, on the &quot;Brederode&quot; kept up fleet morale by not lowering Tromp&#x27;s standard, pretending Tromp was still alive. At this point Evertsen assumed command, and with this the Dutch admirals returned to their ships and resumed battle with &quot;unabated vigour&quot;. The loss of Tromp was a severe blow to the Dutch navy. The battle proved to be a tactical victory for the English, but a strategic victory for the Dutch in that they had the blockade removed.

==Legacy==
Tromp was held in high esteem in the Dutch navy and with the general public. His death was a severe blow to the Dutch navy but also to the Orangists, who sought the defeat of the Commonwealth of England and the restoration of the Stuart monarchy. Republican influence strengthened after Scheveningen, which led to peace negotiations with the Commonwealth, culminating in the Treaty of Westminster. He received a state funeral in August 1653 at the Oude Kerk in Delft where a monument was erected to his honor. Tromp was survived by his second son, Cornelis Maartenszoon Tromp (1629-1691), who was also a distinguished naval officer.

<doc id="62719" wikidata="Q17069163" url="?curid=62719" title="Line-item veto in the United States">
<text>In United States government, the [[line-item veto]], or partial veto, is the power of an executive authority to nullify or cancel specific provisions of a bill, usually a budget appropriations bill, without vetoing the entire legislative package. The line-item vetoes are usually subject to the possibility of legislative override as are traditional vetoes.

==Governors==
Forty-four of the 50 U.S. states give their governors some form of line-item veto power; Indiana, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Vermont are the exceptions. The Mayor of Washington, D.C., also has this power.

===Wisconsin===
The Governor of Wisconsin is empowered with a sweeping line-item veto. Wisconsin governors have the power to strike out words, numbers, and even entire sentences from appropriations bills.

According to scholars, Wisconsin has used four types of extraordinary partial vetoes. The first, the &quot;digit veto&quot;, was first used by Governor Patrick Lucey in 1973. In appropriation for $25 million, he vetoed the digit 2, resulting in an appropriation of $5 million. Just two years later, Lucey introduced the &quot;editing veto&quot;. In this instance, the word &quot;not&quot; was removed in the phrase &quot;not less than 50 percent&quot;, thus resulting in the opposite effect than desired by the legislature. In 1983, an even more extreme version, the &quot;pick-a-letter&quot; or &quot;Vanna White veto&quot; was introduced. Governor Anthony Earl edited a 121-word, five-sentence paragraph down to a one-sentence, 22-word paragraph to change an appeals process from the courts to the Public Service Commission. The final version, the &quot;reduction veto&quot;, was introduced in 1993 by Governor Tommy Thompson. This resulted in a legislatively-appropriated amount being reduced arbitrarily by the governor. This unprecedented usage has resulted in eight lawsuits and numerous amendment proposals. In the first lawsuit, &quot;State ex. rel. Wisconsin Telephone Co. v. Henry&quot;, the Wisconsin Supreme Court recognized the absolute partial veto power of the Governor as long as a workable, complete law remained, stating the governor had &quot;the right to pass independently on every separable piece of legislation in an appropriation bill.&quot;

In his first two terms as governor, Thompson used 1,500 line-item vetoes to cancel a total of $150 million in spending; none of these vetoes were overridden. The only judicial limitation was &quot;Risser v. Klauser&quot;, which prohibited the &quot;reduction veto&quot;, stating that &quot;the constitution prohibits a write-in veto of monetary figures which are not appropriation amounts.&quot; In 1990, a constitutional amendment was passed abolishing the &quot;Vanna White veto,&quot; which allowed the governor to strike individual letters within words to create new words. Yet, in 2011, Governor Scott Walker controversially crossed out 116 words in a pension-related section of the budget bill.

In 2023, Governor Tony Evers used a line-item veto to extend what was supposed to be a two year temporary funding increase for schools to last over 400 years.

==Confederate States==
Article 1, Section 7 of the Constitution of the Confederate States, adopted just before the start of the American Civil War, would have granted the President of the Confederate States the ability to &quot;approve any appropriation and disapprove any other appropriation in the same bill,&quot; with such disapprovals returned to the Houses of Congress for reconsideration and potentially for override.

==Line-Item Veto Act of 1996==
Presidents of the United States have repeatedly asked Congress to give them line-item veto power. According to Louis Fisher in &quot;The Politics of Shared Power,&quot; Ronald Reagan said to Congress in his 1984 State of the Union address, &quot;Tonight I ask you to give me what forty-three governors have: Give me a line-item veto this year. Give me the authority to veto waste, and I&#x27;ll take the responsibility, I&#x27;ll make the cut, I&#x27;ll take the heat.&quot; Bill Clinton echoed the request in his State of the Union address in 1995. Congress granted this power to the president by the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 to control &quot;pork barrel spending&quot;, but in 1998 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled the act to be unconstitutional in a 6–3 decision in &quot;Clinton v. City of New York&quot;. The court found that exercise of the line-item veto is tantamount to a unilateral amendment or repeal by the executive of only parts of statutes authorizing federal spending, and therefore violated the Presentment Clause of the United States Constitution. Thus a federal line-item veto, at least in this particular formulation, would only be possible through a constitutional amendment. Prior to that ruling, President Clinton applied the line-item veto to the federal budget 82 times.

==Subsequent developments==
Though the Supreme Court struck down the Line-Item Veto Act in 1998, President George W. Bush asked Congress to enact legislation that would return the line-item veto power to the Executive Authority. First announcing his intent to seek such legislation in his January 31, 2006, State of the Union address, President Bush sent a legislative proposal, the Legislative Line-Item Veto Act of 2006, to the Congress on March 6, 2006, urging its prompt passage. Senators Bill Frist (R-TN) and John McCain (R-AZ), and Republican Whip Senator Mitch McConnell (R-KY) jointly introduced this proposal. Representative Paul Ryan (R-WI) introduced his own version, the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006, in March of that year.

On that same day, Joshua Bolten, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, gave a press conference on the President’s line-item veto proposal. Bolten explained that the proposed Act would give the President the ability to single out &quot;wasteful&quot; spending and to put such spending on hold. While the spending line-item is on hold, the President can send legislation to Congress to withdraw the particular line-item. The proposal would then be considered in both houses within ten days on an up or down basis and could be passed by a simple majority. Additionally, such proposals could not be filibustered.

When asked how this proposed legislation was different from the 1996 Line-Item Veto Act that the United States Supreme Court had declared illegal, Bolten said that whereas the former act granted unilateral authority to the Executive to disallow specific spending line items, the new proposal would seek Congressional approval of such line-item vetoes. Thus, for the President to successfully withdraw previously enacted spending, a simple majority of Congress is required to agree to specific legislation to that effect.

Though the 2006 line-item veto proposal was much weaker than the 1996 version, it nevertheless failed to find strong support in Congress. Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, called it &quot;an offensive slap at Congress&quot;, asserting that the legislation would enable the President to intimidate individual members of any Congress by targeting the projects of his political opponents. He also complained that the line-item veto as proposed would take away Congress’s constitutional &quot;power of the purse&quot; and give it to the executive branch.

On June 8, 2006, Viet D. Dinh, Professor of Law at Georgetown University Law Center, and Nathan Sales, John M. Olin Fellow at Georgetown University Law Center, testified by written statement before the House Committee on the Budget on the constitutional issues in connection with the proposed legislation. Dinh and Sales argued that the Legislative Line Item Veto Act of 2006 satisfies the Constitution&#x27;s Bicameralism and Presentment Clause, and therefore avoids the constitutional issues raised in the 1996 Act struck down by the Supreme Court. They also stated that the proposed Act is consistent with the basic principle that grants Congress broad discretion to establish procedures to govern its internal operations.

H.R. 4890, the Legislative Line-Item Veto Act, was approved by the House Budget Committee on June 14, 2006, by a vote of 24–9. It was approved in the full House on June 22. A similar version was included in the &quot;Stop Over Spending Act of 2006&quot;, authored by Senator Judd Gregg, in the Senate and approved by the Senate Budget Committee, but the full Senate failed to approve it, thereby preventing the Legislative Line-Item Veto Act from becoming law.

===Line Item Veto Re-Enactment Activity of 2009===
In 2009, Senators Russ Feingold (D-WI) and John McCain introduced legislation of a limited version of the line-item veto. This bill would give the president the power to withdraw earmarks in new bills by sending the bill back to Congress minus the line-item vetoed earmark. Congress would then vote on the line-item vetoed bill with a majority vote under fast track rules to make any deadlines the bill had. This bill was not passed.

===Debate===
Some scholars, such as Louis Fisher, believe the line-item veto would give presidents too much power over government spending compared with the power of the Congress.

<doc id="62720" wikidata="Q721869" url="?curid=62720" title="Reverse Address Resolution Protocol">
<text>The Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) is an obsolete computer communication protocol used by a client computer to request its Internet Protocol (IPv4) address from a computer network, when all it has available is its link layer or hardware address, such as a MAC address. The client broadcasts the request and does not need prior knowledge of the network topology or the identities of servers capable of fulfilling its request.

RARP has been rendered obsolete by the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) and the modern Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), which both support a much greater feature set than RARP.

RARP requires one or more server hosts to maintain a database of mappings of link layer addresses to their respective protocol addresses. MAC addresses need to be individually configured on the servers by an administrator. RARP is limited to serving only IP addresses.

Reverse ARP differs from the Inverse Address Resolution Protocol (InARP), which is designed to obtain the IP address associated with a local Frame Relay data link connection identifier. InARP is not used in Ethernet.

==Modern Day Uses==

Although the original uses for RARP have been superseded by different protocols, some modern-day protocols use RARP to handle MAC migration, particularly in virtual machines, using a technique originating in QEMU.

Examples include:
* Cisco&#x27;s Overlay Transport Virtualization (OTV). RARP is used to update the layer 2 forwarding tables when a MAC address moves between data centers.
* VMware vSphere&#x27;s vMotion. RARP is used when a VM MAC moves between hosts.

<doc id="62723" wikidata="Q1422806" url="?curid=62723" title="Alta California">
<text>Alta California (&#x27;Upper California&#x27;), also known as Nueva California (&#x27;New California&#x27;) among other names, was a province of New Spain formally established in 1804. Along with the Baja California peninsula, it had previously comprised the province of , but was made a separate province in 1804 (named ). Following the Mexican War of Independence, it became a territory of Mexico in April 1822 and was renamed in 1824.

The territory included all of the present-day U.S. states of California, Nevada, and Utah, and parts of Arizona, Wyoming, and Colorado. The territory was with Baja California (as a single ) in Mexico&#x27;s 1836 &quot;Siete Leyes&quot; (Seven Laws) constitutional reform, granting it more autonomy. That change was undone in 1846, but rendered moot by the outcome of the Mexican–American War in 1848, when most of the areas formerly comprising Alta California were ceded to the U.S. in the treaty which ended the war. In 1850, California joined the union as the 31st state.

The El Camino Real trail established by the Spanish extended from Mexico City west to Santa Fe, and California, as well as east to Florida. To the southeast, beyond the deserts and the Colorado River, lay the Spanish settlements in Arizona. Spanish soldiers, settlers, and missionaries invaded the homelands of the Indigenous peoples of California, people of the Great Basin, and the Pueblo peoples in the establishment of Alta California.

Evidence of Alta California remains in the numerous Spanish place names of American cities such as Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Bernardino, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, Santa Ana, and Santa Rosa.

==History==
===Plans for colonization (1697–1769)===
Father Eusebio Kino missionized the Pimería Alta from 1687 until his death in 1711. In 1697, a Jesuit expansion into California was funded and the Misión de Nuestra Señora de Loreto Conchó was established that same year. Plans in 1715 by Juan Manuel de Oliván Rebolledo resulted in a 1716 decree for extension of the conquest (of Baja California) which came to nothing. Juan Bautista de Anssa proposed an expedition from Sonora in 1737 and the Council of the Indies planned settlements in 1744, although these plans did not take action.

Don Fernando Sánchez Salvador researched the earlier proposals and suggested the area of the Gila and Colorado Rivers as the locale for forts or presidios preventing the French or the English from &quot;occupying Monterey and invading the neighboring coasts of California which are at the mouth of the Carmel River.&quot; Alta California was not easily accessible from New Spain: land routes were cut off by deserts and Indigenous peoples who were hostile to invasion. Sea routes ran counter to the southerly currents of the distant northwestern Pacific. Ultimately, New Spain did not have the economic resources nor population to settle such a far northern outpost.

Spanish interest in colonizing Alta California was revived under the &quot;visita&quot; of José de Gálvez as part of his plans to completely reorganize the governance of the Interior Provinces and push Spanish settlement further north. In subsequent decades, news of Russian colonization and maritime fur trading in Alaska, and the 1768 naval expedition of Pyotr Krenitsyn and Mikhail Levashov alarmed the Spanish government and served to justify Gálvez&#x27;s vision.

===Spanish colonization (1769–1821)===

The Portolá expedition was the first European land-entry expedition into the area that is now California. The missionaries and soldiers encountered numerous Indigenous peoples of the area, who became the primary subjects of the expanding Jesuit and Franciscan missions that were already established in Baja California and Baja California Sur. The expedition first established the Presidio of San Diego at the site of the Kumeyaay village of Kosa&#x27;aay, which became the first European settlement in the present state of California. At first contact, the villagers provided food and water for the expedition, who were suffering from scurvy and water deprivation.

The first Alta California mission was founded that same year adjacent to the village Mission San Diego de Alcalá, founded by the Franciscan friar Junípero Serra and Gaspar de Portolá in San Diego in 1769. Similar to the site of this mission, subsequent missions and presidios were often founded at the site of Indigenous villages. Mission San Gabriel Arcángel was founded at the Tongva village Toviscanga and the Pueblo de Los Ángeles at the village of Yaanga. The first settlers of Los Angeles were African and mulatto Catholics, including at least ten of the recently re-discovered Los Pobladores. Mission San Juan Capistrano was founded at the Acjachemen village of Acjacheme. Mission San Fernando was founded at Achooykomenga.

As the Spanish and civilian settlers further intruded into Indigenous lands and imposed their practices, ideas of property, and religion onto them backed by the force of soldiers and settlers, Indigenous peoples formed rebellions on Spanish missions and settlements. A major rebellion at Mission San Gabriel in 1785 was led by the medicine woman Toypurina. Runaways from the missions were common, where abuse, malnourishment, and overworking were common features of daily life. Runaways would sometimes find shelter at more distant villages, such as a group of runaways who found refuge at the Vanyume village of Wá&#x27;peat, the chief of which refused to give them up. Many children died young at the missions. One missionary reported that 3 of every 4 children born at Mission San Gabriel died before reaching the age of two.

The precolonial Indigenous population of California is estimated to have numbered around 340,000 people, who were diverse culturally and linguistically. From 1769–1832, at least 87,787 baptisms and 63,789 deaths of Indigenous peoples occurred, demonstrating the immense death rate at the missions in Alta California. Conversion to Christianity at the colonial missions was often resisted by Indigenous peoples in Alta California. Many missionaries in the province wrote of their frustrations with teaching Indigenous people to internalize Catholic scripture and practice. Many Indigenous people learned to navigate religious expectations at the missions with complex social behaviors in order to maintain their cultural and religious practices.

====Establishment of ranchos====
In 1784, the Spanish established the first rancho, Rancho San Pedro, as a 48,000 acre site for cattle grazing. Nine ranchos were subsequently established before 1800. Spanish, and later Mexican, governments rewarded retired &quot;soldados de cuera&quot; with large land grants, known as &quot;ranchos&quot;, for the raising of cattle and sheep. Hides and tallow from the livestock were the primary exports of California until the mid-19th century. Similar to the missions, the construction, ranching and domestic work on these vast estates was primarily done by Indigenous peoples, who learned to speak Spanish and ride horses. Under Spanish and Mexican rule, the ranchos prospered and grew. &quot;Rancheros&quot; (cattle ranchers) and &quot;pobladores&quot; (townspeople) evolved into the unique Californio culture.
By law, mission land and property were to pass to the Indigenous population after a period of about ten years, when the Indigenous people would become Spanish subjects. In the interim period, the Franciscans were to act as mission administrators who held the land in trust for the Indigenous residents. The Franciscans, however, prolonged their control over the missions even after control of Alta California passed from Spain to independent Mexico, and continued to run the missions until they were secularized, beginning in 1833. The transfer of property never occurred under the Franciscans.

As the number of Spanish settlers grew in Alta California, the boundaries and natural resources of the mission properties became disputed. Conflicts between the Crown and the Church arose over land. State and ecclesiastical bureaucrats debated over authority of the missions. The Franciscan priests of Mission Santa Clara de Asís sent a petition to the governor in 1782 which stated that the Mission Indians owned both the land and cattle and represented the Ohlone against the Spanish settlers in nearby San José. The priests reported that Indians&#x27; crops were being damaged by the pueblo settlers&#x27; livestock and that the settlers&#x27; livestock was also &quot;getting mixed up with the livestock belonging to the Indians from the mission&quot; causing losses. They advocated that the Indigenous people be allowed to own property and have the right to defend it.

====Province of Alta California====
In 1804, due to the growth of the Spanish population in new northern settlements, the province of Las Californias was divided just south of San Diego, following mission president Francisco Palóu&#x27;s division between the Dominican and Franciscan jurisdictions. Governor Diego de Borica is credited with defining the border between Alta (upper) and Baja (lower) California&#x27;s as Palóu&#x27;s division, while the division became the political reality under José Joaquín de Arrillaga, who would become the first governor of Alta California.

The &quot;cortes&quot; (legislature) of New Spain issued a decree in 1813 for at least partial secularization that affected all missions in America and was to apply to all outposts that had operated for ten years or more; however, the decree was never enforced in California.

The Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819, between the United States and Spain, established the northern limit of Alta California at latitude 42°N, which remains the boundary between the states of California, Nevada and Utah (to the south) and Oregon and Idaho (to the north) to this day. Mexico won independence in 1821, and Alta California became a territory of Mexico the next year.

===Independent Mexico (1821–1846)===
Mexico gained independence from Spain on August 24, 1821, upon conclusion of the decade-long Mexican War of Independence. As the successor state to the Viceroyalty of New Spain, Mexico automatically included the provinces of Alta California and Baja California as territories. Alta California declared allegiance to the new Mexican nation and elected a representative to be sent to Mexico City. On November 9, 1822, the first legislature of California was created. With the establishment of a republican government in 1824, Alta California, like many northern territories, was not recognized as one of the constituent States of Mexico because of its small population. The 1824 Constitution of Mexico refers to Alta California as a &quot;territory&quot;.

====Secularization of the missions (1833)====
Resentment was increasing toward appointed territorial governors sent from Mexico City, who came with little knowledge of local conditions and concerns. Laws were imposed by the central government without much consideration of local conditions, such as the Mexican secularization act of 1833, causing friction between governors and the people.

In 1836, Mexico repealed the 1824 federalist constitution and adopted a more centralist political organization (under the &quot;Seven Laws&quot;) that reunited Alta and Baja California in a single California Department (). The change, however, had little practical effect in far-off Alta California. The capital of Alta California remained Monterey, as it had been since the 1769 Portola expedition first established a military/civil government, and the local political structures were unchanged.

The friction came to a head in 1836, when Monterey-born Juan Bautista Alvarado led a revolt against the 1836 constitution, seizing control of Monterey from Nicolás Gutiérrez. Alvarado&#x27;s actions nearly led to a civil war with loyalist forces based in Los Angeles, but a ceasefire was arranged. After an unsettled period, Alvarado agreed to support the 1839 constitution, and Mexico City appointed him to serve as governor from 1837 to 1842. Other &quot;Californio&quot; governors followed, including Carlos Antonio Carrillo, and Pío Pico. The last non-Californian governor, Manuel Micheltorena, was driven out after another rebellion in 1845. Micheltorena was replaced by Pío Pico, last Mexican governor of California, who served until 1846 when the U.S. military occupation began.

===Mexican–American War (1846–1848)===
In the final decades of Mexican rule, American and European immigrants arrived and settled in the former Alta California. Those in Southern California mainly settled in and around the established coastal settlements and tended to intermarry with the Californios. In Northern California, they mainly formed new settlements further inland, especially in the Sacramento Valley, and these immigrants focused on fur-trapping and farming and kept apart from the Californios.
In 1846, following reports of the annexation of Texas to the United States, American settlers in inland Northern California took up arms, captured the Mexican garrison town of Sonoma, and declared independence there as the California Republic. At the same time, the United States and Mexico had gone to war, and forces of the United States Navy entered into Alta California and took possession of the northern port cities of Monterey and San Francisco. The forces of the California Republic, upon encountering the United States Navy and, from them, learning of the state of war between Mexico and the United States, abandoned their independence and proceeded to assist the United States forces in securing the remainder of Alta California. The California Republic was never recognized by any nation and existed for less than one month, but its flag (the &quot;Bear Flag&quot;) survives as the flag of the State of California.

After the United States Navy&#x27;s seizure of the cities of southern California, the Californios formed irregular units, which were victorious in the Siege of Los Angeles, and after the arrival of the United States Army, fought in the Battle of San Pasqual and the Battle of Domínguez Rancho. But the Californios were defeated in subsequent encounters, the battles of Río San Gabriel and La Mesa. The southern Californios formally surrendered with the signing of the Treaty of Cahuenga on January 13, 1847. After twenty-seven years as part of independent Mexico, California was ceded to the United States in 1848 with the signing of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. The United States paid Mexico $15 million for the lands ceded.

<text>Wilhelm Friedrich Ackermann (; ; 29 March 1896 – 24 December 1962) was a German mathematician and logician best known for his work in mathematical logic and the Ackermann function, an important example in the theory of computation.

==Biography==
Ackermann was born in Herscheid, Germany, and was awarded a Ph.D. by the University of Göttingen in 1925 for his thesis &quot;Begründung des &quot;tertium non datur&quot; mittels der Hilbertschen Theorie der Widerspruchsfreiheit&quot;, which was a consistency proof of arithmetic apparently without Peano induction (although it did use e.g. induction over the length of proofs). This was one of two major works in proof theory in the 1920s and the only one following Hilbert&#x27;s school of thought. From 1929 until 1948, he taught at the Arnoldinum Gymnasium in Burgsteinfurt, and then at Lüdenscheid until 1961. He was also a corresponding member of the Akademie der Wissenschaften (&quot;Academy of Sciences&quot;) in Göttingen, and was an honorary professor at the University of Münster.

In 1928, Ackermann helped David Hilbert turn his 1917 – 22 lectures on introductory mathematical logic into a text, &quot;Principles of Mathematical Logic&quot;. This text contained the first exposition ever of first-order logic, and posed the problem of its completeness and decidability (Entscheidungsproblem). Ackermann went on to construct consistency proofs for set theory (1937), full arithmetic (1940), type-free logic (1952), and a new axiomatization of set theory (1956).

Later in life, Ackermann continued working as a high school teacher. He kept engaged in the field of research and published many contributions to the foundations of mathematics until the end of his life. He died in Lüdenscheid, West Germany in December 1962.

<text>Juan de la Cierva y Codorníu, 1st Count of la Cierva (; 21 September 1895 – 9 December 1936), was a Spanish civil engineer, pilot and a self-taught aeronautical engineer. His most famous accomplishment was the invention in 1920 of a rotorcraft called &quot;Autogiro&quot;, a single-rotor type of aircraft that came to be called autogyro in the English language. In 1923, after four years of experimentation, De la Cierva developed the articulated rotor, which resulted in the world&#x27;s first successful flight of a stable rotary-wing aircraft, with his C.4 prototype.

==Early life==
Juan de la Cierva was born to a wealthy, aristocratic Spanish family, and for a time his father was the war minister. At the age of eight he was spending his pocket money with his friends on experiments with gliders in one of his father&#x27;s work sheds. In their teens they constructed an aeroplane from the wreckage they had bought from a French aviator who had crashed the plane. The final aeroplane used wood from a Spanish bar counter for the propeller. He eventually earned a civil engineering degree and after building and testing the first successful autogyro, moved to the United Kingdom in 1925, where, with the support of Scottish industrialist James G. Weir, he established the Cierva Autogiro Company.

At the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, De la Cierva supported the Nationalist coalition forces, helping the rebels to obtain the De Havilland DH-89 &#x27;Dragon Rapide&#x27; which flew General Franco from the Canary Islands to Spanish Morocco. His brother was summarily executed by the Republican army in Paracuellos del Jarama.

==The gyroplane (autogyro)==
De la Cierva started building aircraft in 1912. In 1914, he designed and built a tri-motor aeroplane which was accepted by the Spanish government. In 1919 he started to consider the use of a rotor to generate lift at low airspeed, and eliminate the risk of stall.

In order to achieve this, he used the ability of a lifting rotor to autorotate, whereby at a suitable pitch setting, a rotor will continue to rotate without mechanical drive, sustained by the torque equilibrium of the lift and drag forces acting on the blades. With De la Cierva&#x27;s autogyro, the rotor was drawn through the air by means of a conventional propeller, with the result that the rotor generated sufficient lift to sustain level flight, climb and descent.

Before this could be satisfactorily achieved, De la Cierva experienced several failures primarily associated with the unbalanced rolling movement generated when attempting take-off, due to dissymmetry of lift between the advancing and retreating blades. This major difficulty was resolved by the introduction of the flapping hinge. In 1923, De la Cierva&#x27;s first successful autogyro was flown at Getafe aerodrome in Spain by Lt. Gomez Spencer.

This pioneering work was carried out in De la Cierva&#x27;s native Spain. In 1925, he brought his C.6 to Britain and demonstrated it to the Air Ministry at Farnborough, Hampshire. This machine had a four blade rotor with flapping hinges but relied upon conventional airplane controls for pitch, roll and yaw. It was based upon an Avro 504K fuselage, initial rotation of the rotor was achieved by the rapid uncoiling of a rope passed around stops on the undersides of the blades.

The Farnborough demonstration was a great success, and resulted in an invitation to continue the work in the UK. As a direct result, and with the assistance of the Scottish industrialist James George Weir, the Cierva Autogiro Company, Ltd., was formed the following year. From the outset De la Cierva concentrated upon the design and the manufacture of rotor systems, relying on other established aircraft manufacturers to produce the airframes, predominantly the A.V. Roe Company.

The Avro built C.8 was a refinement of the C.6, with the more powerful 180hp Lynx radial engine, and several C.8s were built. The C.8R incorporated drag hinges, due to blade flapping motion causing high blade root stresses in the rotor plane of rotation; this modification resulted in other problems such as ground resonance for which drag hinge dampers were fitted.

The resolution of these fundamental rotor problems opened the way to progress, confidence built up rapidly, and after several cross-country flights a C.8L4 was entered for the 1928 Kings Cup Air Race. Although forced to withdraw, the C.8L4 subsequently completed a tour of the British Isles. Later that year it flew from London to Paris thus becoming the first rotating wing aircraft to cross the English Channel. The tour was subsequently extended to include Berlin, Brussels and Amsterdam.

A predominant problem with the autogyro was driving the rotor prior to takeoff. Several methods were attempted in addition to the coiled rope system, which could take the rotor speed to 50% of that required, at which point movement along the ground to reach flying speed was necessary, while tilting the rotor to establish autorotation.

Another approach was to tilt the tail stabiliser to deflect engine slipstream up through the rotor. The most acceptable solution was finally achieved with the C.19 Mk.4, which was produced in some quantities; a direct drive from the engine to the rotor was fitted, through which the rotor could be accelerated up to speed. The system was then declutched prior to executing the take-off run.

As De la Cierva&#x27;s autogyros achieved success and acceptance, others began to follow and with them came further innovation. Most important was the development of direct rotor control through cyclic pitch variation, achieved initially by tilting the rotor hub and subsequently by Raoul Hafner by the application of a spider mechanism that acted directly on each rotor blade. The first production direct control autogyro was the C.30, produced in quantity by Avro, Liore et Olivier, and Focke-Wulf. This machine allowed for change of motion in any direction – upwards, downwards or sideways – by the tilting of the horizontal rotors and also effected a minimising of some of controls used in more conventional aircraft of the period. Development of cyclic pitch variation was also influenced by the Dutch helicopter pioneer Albert Gillis von Baumhauer, who adopted swashplate principle in his designs and probably influenced Cierva in their meeting in 1928.

The introduction of jump take-off was another major improvement in capability. The rotor was accelerated in no-lift pitch until the rotor speed required for flight was achieved, and then declutched. The loss of torque caused the blades to swing forward on angled drag hinges with a resultant increase in collective pitch, causing the aircraft to leap into the air. With all the engine power now applied to the forward thrusting propeller, it was now possible to continue in forward flight with the rotor in autorotation.

The C.40 was the first production jump takeoff autogyro.

Autogyros were built in many countries under De la Cierva licences, including France, Germany, Japan, Russia and the United States.

De la Cierva&#x27;s motivation was to produce an aircraft that would not stall but near the end of his life he accepted the advantages offered by the helicopter and began the initial work towards that end. In 1936, the Cierva Autogiro Company, Ltd. responded to a British Air Ministry specification for a Royal Navy helicopter with the gyrodyne.

==Death==

On the morning of 9 December 1936, he boarded a Dutch DC-2 of KLM at Croydon Airfield, bound for Amsterdam. After delay caused by heavy fog, the airliner took off at about 10:30 am but drifted slightly off course after takeoff and exploded after flying into a house on gently rising terrain to the south of the airport, killing 15 people, among them de la Cierva.

==Legacy ==
Juan de la Cierva&#x27;s work on rotor-wing dynamics made possible the modern helicopter, whose development as a practical means of flight had been prevented by a lack of understanding of these matters. The understanding that he established is applicable to all rotor-winged aircraft; though lacking true vertical flight capability, work on the autogyro forms the basis for helicopter analysis.

De la Cierva&#x27;s death in an aeroplane crash in December 1936 prevented him from fulfilling his recent decision to build a useful and reliable aircraft capable of true vertical flight for the Royal Navy, but it was his work on the autogyro that was used to achieve this goal. Technology developed for the autogyro was used in the development of the experimental Fw 61 helicopter, which was flown in 1936 by Cierva Autogiro Company licensee Focke-Achgelis. His pioneering work also led to the development of a third type of rotorcraft, the gyrodyne, a concept of his former technical assistant and successor as chief technical officer of the Cierva Autogyro Company, Dr. James Allan Jamieson Bennett.

In 1966, Juan de la Cierva was inducted into the International Aerospace Hall of Fame for his innovation in rotor blade technology, using them to generate lift and to control the aircraft&#x27;s attitude with precision. The Juan de la Cierva scholarship from the Spanish Ministry of Science is named after him.

<text>The sense of balance or equilibrioception is the perception of balance and spatial orientation. It helps prevent humans and nonhuman animals from falling over when standing or moving. Equilibrioception is the result of a number of sensory systems working together; the eyes (visual system), the inner ears (vestibular system), and the body&#x27;s sense of where it is in space (proprioception) ideally need to be intact.

The vestibular system, the region of the inner ear where three semicircular canals converge, works with the visual system to keep objects in focus when the head is moving. This is called the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR). The balance system works with the visual and skeletal systems (the muscles and joints and their sensors) to maintain orientation or balance. Visual signals sent to the brain about the body&#x27;s position in relation to its surroundings are processed by the brain and compared to information from the vestibular and skeletal systems.

==Vestibular system==
In the vestibular system, equilibrioception is determined by the level of a fluid called endolymph in the labyrinth, a complex set of tubing in the inner ear.

==Dysfunction==

When the sense of balance is interrupted it causes dizziness, disorientation and nausea. Balance can be upset by Ménière&#x27;s disease, superior canal dehiscence syndrome, an inner ear infection, by a bad common cold affecting the head or a number of other medical conditions including but not limited to vertigo. It can also be temporarily disturbed by quick or prolonged acceleration, for example, riding on a merry-go-round. Blows can also affect equilibrioreception, especially those to the side of the head or directly to the ear.

Most astronauts find that their sense of balance is impaired when in orbit because they are in a constant state of weightlessness. This causes a form of motion sickness called space adaptation syndrome.

==System overview==

 This overview also explains acceleration as its processes are interconnected with balance.

=== Mechanical ===
There are five sensory organs innervated by the vestibular nerve; three semicircular canals (Horizontal SCC, Superior SCC, Posterior SCC) and two otolith organs (saccule and utricle). Each semicircular canal (SSC) is a thin tube that doubles in thickness briefly at a point called osseous ampullae. At their center-base, each contains an ampullary cupula. The cupula is a gelatin bulb connected to the stereocilia of hair cells, affected by the relative movement of the endolymph it is bathed in.

Since the cupula is part of the bony labyrinth, it rotates along with actual head movement, and by itself without the endolymph, it cannot be stimulated and therefore, could not detect movement. Endolymph follows the rotation of the canal; however, due to inertia its movement initially lags behind that of the bony labyrinth. The delayed movement of the endolymph bends and activates the cupula. When the cupula bends, the connected stereocilia bend along with it, activating chemical reactions in the hair cells surrounding crista ampullaris and eventually create action potentials carried by the vestibular nerve signaling to the body that it has moved in space.

After any extended rotation, the endolymph catches up to the canal and the cupula returns to its upright position and resets. When extended rotation ceases, however, endolymph continues, (due to inertia) which bends and activates the cupula once again to signal a change in movement.

Pilots doing long banked turns begin to feel upright (no longer turning) as endolymph matches canal rotation; once the pilot exits the turn the cupula is once again stimulated, causing the feeling of turning the other way, rather than flying straight and level.

The horizontal SCC handles head rotations about a vertical axis (e.g. looking side to side), the superior SCC handles head movement about a lateral axis (e.g. head to shoulder), and the posterior SCC handles head rotation about a rostral-caudal axis (e.g. nodding). SCC sends adaptive signals, unlike the two otolith organs, the saccule and utricle, whose signals do not adapt over time.

A shift in the otolithic membrane that stimulates the cilia is considered the state of the body until the cilia are once again stimulated. For example, lying down stimulates cilia and standing up stimulates cilia, however, for the time spent lying the signal that you are lying remains active, even though the membrane resets.

Otolithic organs have a thick, heavy gelatin membrane that, due to inertia (like endolymph), lags behind and continues ahead past the macula it overlays, bending and activating the contained cilia.

Utricle responds to linear accelerations and head-tilts in the horizontal plane (head to shoulder), whereas saccule responds to linear accelerations and head-tilts in the vertical plane (up and down). Otolithic organs update the brain on the head-location when not moving; SCC update during movement.

Kinocilium are the longest stereocilia and are positioned (one per 40-70 regular cilia) at the end of the bundle. If stereocilia go towards kinocilium, depolarization occurs, causing more neurotransmitters, and more vestibular nerve firings, as compared to when stereocilia tilt away from kinocilium (hyperpolarization, less neurotransmitter, less firing).

=== Neural ===
First order vestibular nuclei (VN) project to lateral vestibular nucleus (IVN), medial vestibular nucleus (MVN), and superior vestibular nucleus (SVN).

The inferior cerebellar peduncle is the largest center through which balance information passes. It is the area of integration between proprioceptive, and vestibular inputs, to aid in unconscious maintenance of balance and posture.

The inferior olivary nucleus aids in complex motor tasks by encoding coordinating timing sensory information; this is decoded and acted upon in the cerebellum.

The cerebellar vermis has three main parts. The vestibulocerebellum regulates eye movements by the integration of visual info provided by the superior colliculus and balance information. The spinocerebellum integrates visual, auditory, proprioceptive, and balance information to act out body and limb movements. It receives input from the trigeminal nerve, dorsal column (of the spinal cord), midbrain, thalamus, reticular formation and vestibular nuclei (medulla) outputs. Lastly, the cerebrocerebellum plans, times, and initiates movement after evaluating sensory input from, primarily, motor cortex areas, via pons and cerebellar dentate nucleus. It outputs to the thalamus, motor cortex areas, and red nucleus.

The flocculonodular lobe is a cerebellar lobe that helps maintain body equilibrium by modifying muscle tone (the continuous and passive muscle contractions).

MVN and IVN are in the medulla, LVN and SVN are smaller and in pons. SVN, MVN, and IVN ascend within the medial longitudinal fasciculus. LVN descend the spinal cord within the lateral vestibulospinal tract and ends at the sacrum. MVN also descend the spinal cord, within the medial vestibulospinal tract, ending at lumbar 1.

The thalamic reticular nucleus distributes information to various other thalamic nuclei, regulating the flow of information. It is speculatively able to stop signals, ending transmission of unimportant info. The thalamus relays info between pons (cerebellum link), motor cortices, and insula.

The insula is also heavily connected to motor cortices; the insula is likely where balance is likely brought into perception.

The oculomotor nuclear complex refers to fibers going to tegmentum (eye movement), red nucleus (gait (natural limb movement)), substantia nigra (reward), and cerebral peduncle (motor relay). Nucleus of Cajal are one of the named oculomotor nuclei, they are involved in eye movements and reflex gaze coordination.

The abducens nerve solely innervates the lateral rectus muscle of the eye, moving the eye with the trochlear nerve. The trochlear solely innervates the superior oblique muscle of the eye. Together, trochlear and abducens contract and relax to simultaneously direct the pupil towards an angle and depress the globe on the opposite side of the eye (e.g. looking down directs the pupil down and depresses (towards the brain) the top of the globe). The pupil is not only directed, but often rotated, by these muscles. (See visual system)

The thalamus and superior colliculus are connected via the lateral geniculate nucleus. The superior colliculus (SC) is the topographical map for balance and quick orienting movements with primarily visual inputs. SC integrates multiple senses.

==Other animals==
Some animals have better equilibrioception than humans; for example, a cat uses its inner ear and tail to walk on a thin fence.

Equilibrioception in many marine animals is done with an entirely different organ, the statocyst, which detects the position of tiny calcareous stones to determine which way is &quot;up&quot;.

==In plants==
Plants could be said to exhibit a form of equilibrioception, in that when rotated from their normal attitude the stems grow in the direction that is upward (away from gravity) while their roots grow downward (in the direction of gravity). This phenomenon is known as gravitropism and it has been shown that, for example, poplar stems can detect reorientation and inclination.

<text>In computer networking, the Name/Finger protocol and the Finger user information protocol are simple network protocols for the exchange of human-oriented status and user information.

==Name/Finger protocol==
The Name/Finger protocol is based on Request for Comments document RFC 742 (December 1977) as an interface to the codice_1 and codice_2 programs that provide status reports on a particular computer system or a particular person at network sites. The finger program was written in 1971 by Les Earnest who created the program to solve the need of users who wanted information on other users of the network. Information on who is logged in was useful to check the availability of a person to meet. This was probably the earliest form of presence information for remote network users.

Prior to the finger program, the only way to get this information on WAITS was with a WHO program that showed IDs and terminal line numbers (the server&#x27;s internal number of the communication line over which the user&#x27;s terminal is connected) for logged-in users. In reference to the name FINGER, Les Earnest, wrote that he saw users of the WAITS time-sharing system run their fingers down the output of the WHO command.

The finger daemon runs on TCP port 79. The client will (in the case of remote hosts) open a connection to port 79. An RUIP (Remote User Information Program) is started on the remote end of the connection to process the request. The local host sends the RUIP one line query based upon the Finger query specification, and waits for the RUIP to respond. The RUIP receives and processes the query, returns an answer, then initiates the close of the connection. The local host receives the answer and the close signal, then proceeds to close its end of the connection.

The Finger user information protocol is based on RFC 1288 (&quot;The Finger User Information Protocol&quot;, December 1991). Typically the server side of the protocol is implemented by a program codice_3 or codice_4 (for &quot;finger daemon&quot;), while the client side is implemented by the codice_1 and codice_2 programs which are supposed to return a friendly, human-oriented status report on either the system at the moment or a particular person in depth. There is no required format, and the protocol consists mostly of specifying a single command line.

The program would supply information such as whether a user is currently logged-on, e-mail address, full name etc. As well as standard user information, finger displays the contents of the codice_7 and codice_8 files in the user&#x27;s home directory. Often this file (maintained by the user) contains either useful information about the user&#x27;s current activities, similar to micro-blogging, or alternatively all manner of humor.

==Security concerns==
Supplying such detailed information as e-mail addresses and full names was considered acceptable and convenient in the early days of networking, but later was considered questionable for privacy and security reasons.

Finger information has been used by hackers as a way to initiate a social engineering attack on a company&#x27;s computer security system. By using a finger client to get a list of a company&#x27;s employee names, email addresses, phone numbers, and so on, a hacker can call or email someone at a company requesting information while posing as another employee.

The finger daemon has also had several exploitable security holes crackers have used to break into systems. For example, in 1988 the Morris worm exploited an overflow vulnerability in codice_3 (among others) to spread.

For these reasons, by the late 1990s the vast majority of sites on the Internet no longer offered the service.

==Application support==

It is implemented on Unix (like macOS), Unix-like systems (like Linux and FreeBSD), and current versions of Windows (finger.exe command). Other software has finger support:

*Lynx
*Minuet
*Kristall

<text>The Dartford–Thurrock River Crossing, commonly known as the Dartford Crossing and until 1991 the Dartford Tunnel, is a major road crossing of the River Thames in England, carrying the A282 road between Dartford in Kent in the south and Thurrock in Essex in the north.

It consists of two bored tunnels and the cable-stayed Queen Elizabeth II Bridge. The only fixed road crossing of the Thames east of Greater London, it is the busiest estuarial crossing in the United Kingdom, with an average daily use of over 130,000 vehicles. It opened in stages: the west tunnel in 1963, the east tunnel in 1980 and the bridge in 1991. The crossing, although not officially designated a motorway, is considered part of the M25 motorway&#x27;s route, using the tunnels northbound and bridge southbound. Described as one of the most important road crossings in Britain, it suffers from heavy traffic and congestion.

The crossing&#x27;s development started in the late 1930s, but was interrupted due to the Second World War and resumed in the 1950s. The original tunnel catered for a single lane of traffic in each direction, but rising traffic levels required the second tunnel to be built. The M25 connected to the tunnels at both ends when completed in 1986, and the increased traffic put pressure on the tunnels&#x27; capacity. A private finance initiative scheme was started in 1988 to build the bridge. The combined crossing now handles four lanes of traffic in each direction.

The crossing has always been tolled, and though the cost of construction has since been paid back, the toll was retained, and rebranded as a congestion pricing scheme from 1 April 2003. Since 2008 it has been free from 10 pm to 6 am. An automatic number plate recognition charging scheme named the &quot;Dart Charge&quot; began in November 2014. As a result, the booths on the Kent side were removed and the charge is now only payable online, by post, or in participating retail outlets. A residents&#x27; scheme is available, offering discounts for people living near the crossing.

The crossings are operated by Connect Plus Limited on behalf of National Highways as part of a 30-year Design-Build-Finance-Operate agreement that began in 2009.

==Location==

The crossing spans the River Thames between Dartford, Kent, to the south and Thurrock, Essex, to the north. It is about east of the centre of London, outside the Greater London boundary. The two tunnels are long, while the cable-stayed bridge is high with a main span of . A speed limit is in place in both directions. North of the river, the rail line High Speed 1 (between St Pancras and Ebbsfleet International Stations) passes under the approach roads at a near right angle.

The design capacity is 135,000 vehicles per day, but in practice the crossing carries around 160,000. It has been described by the Highways Agency as &quot;a vital transport link for the national and South East economies&quot;, by the former Secretary of State for Transport, Patrick McLoughlin, as &quot;a crucial part of the country&#x27;s strategic road network&quot;, and by the local Thurrock Council as &quot;one of Europe&#x27;s most heavily used crossings and complex traffic management systems&quot;. It is signed as a major destination on London&#x27;s orbital route, the M25, though the crossing and its approach road are an all-purpose road (the A282); this allows some (though not all) non-motorway traffic—such as mopeds, learner drivers and agricultural vehicles—to use it, and theoretically lowers the national speed limit on the road from 70 to 60 miles per hour (the speed limit for the crossing is set at 50 mph regardless). Though not the name of the crossing infrastructure, the actual road across the Thames is named Canterbury Way. Southbound traffic crosses the four-lane bridge, while northbound traffic uses both of the two-lane road tunnels. The bridge can be closed due to high winds or maintenance. On these occasions, traffic uses the tunnels in both directions. The crossing and its approaches, like most UK urban motorways, are equipped with lane control and variable-message signs to manage traffic.

===Alternative routes===
The next nearest vehicle crossings to the west of Dartford are the Woolwich Ferry and the Blackwall Tunnel, both well within East London. When the bridge is closed in high winds and for maintenance, no convenient diversion exists through London for the higher-limit southbound vehicles. Those over are diverted around the far side of the M25.

A number of new crossings have been proposed as relief for the Dartford Crossing. The proposed Thames Gateway Bridge to the west was provisionally supported in 2004, but was cancelled in November 2008 when Boris Johnson became Mayor of London. Johnson subsequently proposed the Gallions Reach Ferry, a ferry crossing in the same location, as an alternative. The Lower Thames Crossing is a proposed tunnel to the east between Shorne, Kent and South Ockendon, Essex. Thurrock Council suggest that this crossing will be essential for managing congestion. A public consultation on the scheme ended in March 2016, with the route announced in April 2017.
, contracts have been awarded and the target date for completion is 2032.

==Charges==
A free-flow electronic charging system called Dart Charge began in November 2014 based on automatic number plate recognition. The charge can be paid online or phone, in advance or by midnight the day after crossing, but can no longer be paid in cash at the site since the old toll booths have been removed. However, cash payments are accepted at some Payzone retail outlets. Reminder signs and variable message signs on approaches to the crossing say &quot;Dart charge – find us online. Pay by midnight tomorrow.&quot; Vehicles have to pay the charge if they use the crossing between 6 am and 10 pm seven days per week, and this is indicated on signs. Daily charges for the crossing since October 2018 are:
Various categories of vehicles are exempt from the charge, including emergency services vehicles, military vehicles and those exempt from Vehicle Excise Duty on the grounds of disability.

The charges vary according to the type of vehicle. Motorcycles are free but there are standard charges for cars, two-axle goods vehicles and larger vehicles with more than two axles. Drivers who fail to pay the charge are issued with a penalty charge notice. There are no signs warning of penalty charges.

Since 2008, a local residents&#x27; scheme gives 50 crossings to car drivers resident in the Dartford and Thurrock council areas for an annual registration fee of £10, with additional crossings at 20p each. On 1 March 2014, this scheme was extended to include privately owned two-axle goods vehicles. A further option was introduced giving unlimited crossings for £20 annually. Around 44,000 drivers take advantage of this scheme each year. Although the website for paying the charge is operated by the UK Government, the contract for the free-flow charging system is held by French public roads operator Société des Autoroutes du Nord et de l&#x27;Est de la France (SANEF) on behalf of the Government.

==History==

===Western tunnel===

The idea of a tunnel crossing was first proposed by the Ministry of Transport in 1924. Initial reports at the start of the year suggested a crossing between Tilbury and Gravesend, replacing a ferry service, but this had been rejected by July in favour of a route further upstream, near Dartford. By 1929, the total cost of building the tunnel had been estimated at £3 million (equivalent to £ million in ). The tunnel was planned to be part of a general orbital route around London and was provisionally known as part of the &quot;South Orbital Road&quot;. The &#x27; (20 &amp; 21 Geo. 5. c. clxxxii) authorised the construction of the tunnel, and set tolls to be charged for its use. It was amended by the &#x27; (1 Edw. 8. &amp; 1 Geo. 6. c. cxxvii) to adjust the design and increase the permitted tolls.
The first engineering work to take place was a compressed air driven pilot tunnel, which was drilled between 1936 and 1938. Work on the tunnel was delayed due to World War II, and resumed in 1959, using a Greathead Shield, similar to the work on the Blackwall Tunnel some 60 years earlier. The delay in work due to the war allowed the tunnel&#x27;s design to be improved, which included a better ventilation system. After negotiations with the Ministry of Transport, Kent and Essex county councils obtained government approval to increase the previously set tolls in 1960, before opening. The two-lane bore, 28 feet | 8.6m diameter tunnel opened to traffic on 18 November 1963; the total project cost was £13 million (equivalent to £ million in ) and it initially served approximately 12,000 vehicles per day.

The toll was originally two shillings and sixpence, equivalent to 12.5p post-decimalisation, and approximately equivalent in purchasing power to £ in . The (c. xxxvii) gave a joint committee of Kent and Essex county councils (the Dartford Tunnel Joint Committee) the authority to increase the tolls, and in December 1977, the toll was raised from 25p to 35p for cars, 40p to 55p for two-axle goods vehicles, and 60p to 85p for HGVs. By 1984, the toll for cars had risen to 60p.

===Eastern tunnel===

The first tunnel was expected to carry two million vehicles a year but by 1970 was carrying over eight million. That year, Michael Heseltine, then a junior transport minister, announced that a second tunnel would be built in conjunction with the North Orbital Road, later to become the M25.

Construction was approved in April 1971, with an initial expected opening date in 1976. Work was delayed due to a lack of funds, which was resolved by EEC funding granted in 1974. The second tunnel opened in May 1980, allowing each tunnel to handle one direction of traffic, by which time the joint capacity of the two tunnels had increased to 65,000 vehicles per day. Connection of the crossing to the M25 was completed on the northerly Essex side in September 1982 (Junction 31), and to the southerly Kent side in September 1986 (Junction 1a). Following the completion of the M25 in 1986, the daily demand had grown to 79,000 vehicles.

===Queen Elizabeth II Bridge===


During the early 1980s, it was anticipated that traffic through the tunnel would rise on the completion of the M25 in 1986. At the time, the expectation was that other routes in London would be improved instead, diverting 15% of traffic away from the tunnel. In 1985, the Transport Minister, Lynda Chalker, announced that the number of toll booths would be increased to 12 each way, but concern grew that two tunnels would not be able to cope with the full demands of a completed M25.

Between September 1985 and December 1986, proposals for improvements to the Dartford Crossing underwent several changes, and in 1986, a Trafalgar House consortium won a bid to build a new bridge at Dartford crossing, valued at £86 million (£ million in ). At the time there were several other privately financed projects planned or under construction in the UK, including the Second Severn Crossing. From 1981 until the establishment of the private finance initiative (PFI) regime in the late 1980s, private investment projects were governed by the Ryrie Rules which dictated that &quot;any privately-financed solution must be shown to be more cost-effective than a publicly-financed alternative, and that privately-financed expenditure by nationalised industries could not be additional to public expenditure provision&quot; [annual budget], &quot;which would be reduced by the amount of private finance borrowed.&quot;

On 31 July 1988, a private finance initiative concession was enabled under the Dartford-Thurrock Crossing Act 1988 (c. 20), which transferred control of the crossing from Kent and Essex county councils to Dartford River Crossing Limited, a private company managed by Rodney Jones. The company would also bear the debt of the bridge, then under construction, &quot;financed 100% by debt, with no equity contribution&quot;. The private company was at risk of not recuperating their costs, but ultimately the Dartford scheme demonstrated that the Ryrie Rules were no longer a barrier to the private financing of public infrastructure projects. The concession was scheduled for 20 years from the transfer date, with a stipulation that it could end when debts had been paid off, which was agreed to have been achieved on 31 March 2002. According to the &quot;International Handbook on Public-Private Partnership&quot;, the chief financing for the project came from a &quot;20-year subordinated loan stock, 16-year loan stock and £85 million (£ million in ) as a term loan from banks&quot;. The construction contract was let to a joint venture of Kværner, Cleveland Bridge &amp; Engineering Company and the Cementation Company.

Construction of the bridge started immediately after the creation of the PFI in 1988. It was designed by German civil engineer , with the UK&#x27;s Halcrow Group acting as category 3 check engineer, employer&#x27;s agent and engineering adviser. The two main caissons supporting the bridge piers were constructed in the Netherlands. Each caisson was designed to withstand a bridge strike of a ship weighing up to 65,000 tonnes and travelling up to The bridge deck is about high, and it took a team of around 56 to assemble its structure. During construction of the approach road, a World War II bomb was found in its path, which required closure of the entire crossing.

The bridge was opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 30 October 1991. The total cost of construction was £120 million (£ in ), including £30 million (£ million in ) for the approach roads. The proposed name had been simply the Dartford Bridge, but Thurrock residents objected and suggested the Tilbury Bridge, leading to a compromise. At the time of opening, it had the longest cable-stayed span of any bridge in Europe. It is the only bridge across the Thames downstream of Central London to be opened since Tower Bridge in 1894.

===Charging scheme===
In 2000, the European Union issued a directive that value-added tax should be charged on all road tolls, including the Dartford Crossing. The Government opposed the directive and said it would bear the additional cost. It was anticipated that the tolls would be removed on 1 April 2003 under the original PFI scheme contract. However, the Highways Agency decided that the tolls would become a &quot;charge&quot;, under legislation introduced by the Transport Act 2000 to introduce charging schemes on any trunk road bridge or tunnel at least in length.

Under the 2000 Transport Act, the A282 Trunk Road (Dartford-Thurrock Crossing charging scheme) Order 2002 allowed the continuation of the crossing fee, which officially became a charge and not a toll on 1 April 2003. Management of the crossing was contracted to Le Crossing Company Limited on behalf of the Highways Agency. In September 2009 the Highways Agency made a new contract with Connect Plus (M25) Limited. As well as maintaining the crossing, the contract required the company to widen around 40 miles of the M25 and to refurbish a tunnel on the A1(M) at Hatfield. In October 2009, the Government announced its intention to sell the crossing as part of a public sector deficit reduction strategy. The announcement was unpopular with local residents, who encouraged drivers to sound their horns in protest when using the crossing. After the change of government following the 2010 general election, the new prime minister David Cameron announced that the crossing might still be sold, despite local opposition, particularly from Gareth Johnson, Member of Parliament (MP) for Dartford. Subsequently, the chancellor George Osborne announced that charges would be increased instead to cover the budget deficit. Pre-pay accounts for the crossing were introduced around this time; drivers held an electronic device called a DART-Tag in the vehicle that automatically deducted the charge at payment booths. This was abolished when the Dart Charge was introduced in 2014.

Under the 2008 Charging Order introduced on 15 November 2008, charges between 10 pm and 6 am were discontinued, but standard daytime rates increased, starting at £1.50 for cars. On 7 October 2012 the charges increased to £2 for cars, £2.50 for 2 axle goods vehicles and £5 for multi-axle goods vehicles. By 2012, local businesses were complaining that the crossing&#x27;s charge booths were impeding local growth. The government announced that a new electronic charging system would be introduced in 2014. Drivers would be able to pay by phone, text, online or in shops. The charge was proposed to increase to £2.50 for cars, £3 for two-axle goods vehicles and £6 for multi-axle vehicles. Drivers not exempt and not paying the charge within 28 days are charged £105.

Preparation work on the free-flow scheme started in April 2014. Concerns were raised about reliability, with a Highways Agency report predicting that it could lose up to £6m of unpaid charges per year. In September, the Highways Agency announced that the new scheme would start to operate at the end of November, though related works to remove barriers would continue until April 2015. Subsequently, the date for removal of the booths was confirmed as 30 November.

The Dart Charge scheme was considered a success by the project management, who claimed it has reduced peak-time round trips over the crossing by 15 minutes. The Automobile Association said the scheme had faults, while a 2015 BBC report showed 1.8 million fines had been issued for failure to pay in the year since the charge was set up.

In 2023, a system upgrade prevented many users from paying the Dart Charge, and National Highways temporarily extended its payment deadline to accommodate the problem.

==Traffic==
 a total of 1,537,084,159 journeys had been made. The highest recorded daily usage was 181,990 on 23 July 2004; since then traffic levels have decreased. The total income for the financial year ended 31 March 2012 was £72,147,091, while the corresponding figure for the following financial year was £80,331,662. A 2016 report by Highways England suggested the crossing is used around 50 million times a year.

===Bus===
There is currently one bus service that uses the crossing, the X80 operated by Ensignbus which runs between Lakeside Shopping Centre and Bluewater.

===Cycling===
Bicycles are not permitted on the crossing, but cyclists can be carried across the crossing by the transport authority. Section 27 of the Dartford-Thurrock Crossing Act 1988 requires that this service be provided free of charge. Cyclists report to the crossing control offices on either side, using a free telephone service. The transfer takes around 15 to 30 minutes.
In October 1963, the Dartford Tunnel Joint Committee ordered five double-decker buses based on the Ford Thames Trader chassis for special duties, taking cyclists through the Dartford Tunnel. These had a lower deck purpose-built for carrying bicycles, with upper deck seats for cyclists. Access was via a stairwell to the upper deck starting several feet above the level of the road, accessible from special platforms built at either end of the tunnel; there was also a ladder built into the side of the bodywork for access elsewhere. The design was criticised for failing to protect any passenger from falling off the vehicle, and running costs were estimated at £2,550 per month, with only £45 revenue. The joint committee contracted London Transport to operate the buses on their behalf. The service was reduced to one bus in April 1964 and then cancelled in 1965, to be replaced by the current transfer service using a vehicle with a rear cycle rack. One of these buses has been preserved.

===Hazardous loads===
The transport of hazardous goods through the crossing is governed by the European ADR Agreement. The Dartford Crossing is class C, which restricts transporting goods such as nitrates and flammable liquids. The introduction of the ADR scheme initially caused confusion, and for a short time, transporting aerosols through the tunnel was banned. Certain hazardous goods vehicles, together with some oversize and abnormal loads (if permitted), may require escorting by National Highways traffic officers. The crossing authority must hold exercises in conjunction with the emergency services. In 2006 Exercise Orpheus was held, involving the closure of both road tunnels for five hours.

===Safety patrol===
The tunnel is patrolled by National Highways traffic officers. Officers may stop and direct traffic on the crossing and its approach roads, and must be in uniform to exercise their powers. The crossing&#x27;s speed limit is enforced by speed cameras; between October 2012 and June 2014, 24,229 drivers were caught speeding, with some travelling as fast as . A spokesman for Highways England said the cameras were &quot;helping us improve safety and make journeys more reliable&quot;. The bridge also has a reduced speed limit of when crosswind is above or headwind above , and is closed entirely if Britain&#x27;s national weather service, the Met Office, predicts crosswind above or headwind above .

===Congestion===
The crossing is the busiest in the United Kingdom, with an average daily use of around 160,000 vehicles. The crossing has high levels of congestion, especially at peak times - with high levels of air pollution impacting neighbouring Thurrock and Dartford.

Because the design capacity has been exceeded, the crossing is subject to major traffic congestion and disruption, particularly when parts are closed because of accidents or bad weather. Though the government was adamant that the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge should be designed to avoid closure due to high winds, the bridge has nevertheless had to close on occasions. On 12 February 2014, during the winter storms, it was closed owing to winds, and again on the evening of 13–14 February 2014.

At busy times there was significant delay at the payment booths when these existed. Because there are numerous junctions on either side of the crossing, a high proportion of local traffic mixes with long-distance traffic, for example travelling from the North and Midlands onward to Continental Europe. In 2004, a BBC survey reported that the crossing was &quot;the most stressful section of the M25&quot; while in 2009, the crossing was listed in a Royal Automobile Club report as the fourth most congested road in Britain. Though Highways England have reported greatly improved journey times since automatic charging was introduced, former local MP Gareth Johnson claims otherwise and has insisted that the Lower Thames Crossing, along with improved signing around Dartford, are better options to reduce congestion. In 2015, he said the crossing was Britain&#x27;s worst stretch of motorway.

==Future==

Since the 2000s, planning work has been underway regarding another crossing of the Thames to ease congestion at the Dartford Crossing. Options considered included an additional crossing at Dartford for long distance M25 traffic, as well as new crossings located in the Swanscombe or Tilbury area.

In 2017, a route connecting the M25 at North Ockendon to the A2 at Thong was selected. The new road will be in length, and have a twin-bore tunnel crossing under the River Thames east of Gravesend and Tilbury. The crossing is estimated to cost between £6.4 billion and £8.2 billion, taking about six years to build once permission is granted.

<doc id="62745" wikidata="Q210035" url="?curid=62745" title="Lethal injection">
<text>Lethal injection is the practice of injecting one or more drugs into a person (typically a barbiturate, paralytic, and potassium solution) for the express purpose of causing rapid death. The main application for this procedure is capital punishment, but the term may also be applied in a broader sense to include euthanasia and other forms of suicide. The drugs cause the person to become unconscious, stops their breathing, and causes a heart arrhythmia, in that order.

First developed in the United States, the method has become a legal means of execution in Mainland China, Thailand (since 2003), Guatemala, Taiwan, the Maldives, Nigeria, and Vietnam, though Guatemala abolished the death penalty for civilian cases in 2017 and has not conducted an execution since 2000, and the Maldives has never carried out an execution since its independence. Although Taiwan permits lethal injection as an execution method, no executions have been carried out in this manner; the same is true for Nigeria. Lethal injection was also used in the Philippines until the country re-abolished the death penalty in 2006.

Although primarily introduced as a more &quot;humane&quot; method of execution, lethal injection has been subject to criticism, being described by some as cruel and unusual. Opponents in particular critique the operation of lethal injections by untrained corrections officers and the lack of guarantee that the victim will be unconscious in every individual case. There have been instances in which condemned individuals have been injected with paralytics, and then a cardiac arrest-inducing agent, while still conscious; this has been compared to torture. Proponents often say that there is no reasonable or less cruel alternative.

==History==
Lethal injection gained popularity in the late 20th century as a form of execution intended to supplant electrocution, gas inhalation, hanging and firing squad, that were considered to be less humane. It is now the most common form of legal execution in the United States.

Lethal injection was proposed on January 17, 1888, by Julius Mount Bleyer, a New York doctor who praised it as being cheaper than hanging. Bleyer&#x27;s idea would not be revived until at least the mid-1970s, when Texas and Oklahoma adopted the modern version of the method; Finally, a series of botched executions led to an eventual rise of public disapproval in electrocutions in the 1980s. Lethal injections were first used by Nazi Germany to execute prisoners during World War II. Nazi Germany developed the Action T4 euthanasia program led by Karl Brandt as one method to dispose of &quot;Lebensunwertes Leben&quot; (&quot;life unworthy of life&quot;). During the war, lethal injections were also administered to children detained at the Sisak concentration camp by the camp&#x27;s commander, the physician Antun Najžer. Royal Commission on Capital Punishment 1949–1953 also considered lethal injection, but eventually ruled it out after pressure from the British Medical Association (BMA).

===Implementation===
On May 10, 1977, Oklahoma became the first U.S. state to approve lethal injection as Governor David Boren signed a bill into law. Episcopal Reverend Bill Wiseman had introduced the method into the Oklahoma legislature, where it passed and was quickly sent to the Governor&#x27;s desk (Title 22, Section 1014(A)). The next day, Texas became the second U.S. state to approve a lethal injection law. Since then, until 2004, 37 of the 38 states using capital punishment introduced lethal injection statutes (the last state, Nebraska, maintaining electrocution as its single method until adopting injection in 2009, after its Supreme Court deemed the electric chair unconstitutional).

On May 11, 1977, the day after the new method had become state law, Oklahoma&#x27;s state medical examiner Jay Chapman proposed making the process a new, less painful method of execution, known as Chapman&#x27;s protocol: &quot;An intravenous saline drip shall be started in the prisoner&#x27;s arm, into which shall be introduced a lethal injection consisting of an ultrashort-acting barbiturate in combination with a chemical paralytic.&quot; The Chapman protocol was approved by anesthesiologist Stanley Deutsch, formerly Head of the Department of Anaesthesiology of the Oklahoma University Medical School, the 
On August 29, 1977, 
Texas adopted the new method of execution, switching from electrocution.

On December 7, 1982, Texas became the first U.S. state and territory in the world to use lethal injection to carry out capital punishment, for the execution of Charles Brooks, Jr.

The People&#x27;s Republic of China began using this method in 1997, Guatemala in 1996, the Philippines in 1999, Thailand in 2003, and Taiwan in 2005. Vietnam first used this method in 2013. The Philippines abolished the death penalty in 2006, with their last execution being in 2000. All seven executions made from 1999 to 2000 were carried out through lethal injection. Guatemalan law still allows for the death penalty and lethal injection is the sole method allowed, but no penalties have been carried out since 2000 when the country experienced the live televised double executions of Amílcar Cetino Pérez and Tomás Cerrate Hernández.

The export of drugs to be used for lethal injection was banned by the European Union (EU) in 2011, together with other items under the EU Torture Regulation. Since then, pentobarbital followed thiopental in the European Union&#x27;s ban.

===Complications of executions and cessation of supply of lethal injection drugs===
By early 2014, a number of botched executions involving lethal injection, and a rising shortage of suitable drugs, had some U.S. states reconsidering lethal injection as a form of execution. Tennessee, which had previously offered inmates a choice between lethal injection and the electric chair, passed a law in May 2014 which gave the state the option to use the electric chair if lethal injection drugs are either unavailable or declared unconstitutional. At the same time, Wyoming and Utah were considering the use of execution by firing squad in addition to other existing execution methods.

In 2016, Pfizer joined over 20 American and European pharmaceutical manufacturers that had previously blocked the sale of their drugs for use in lethal injections, effectively closing the open market for FDA-approved manufacturers for any potential lethal execution drug. In the execution of Carey Dean Moore on August 14, 2018, the State of Nebraska used a novel drug cocktail comprising diazepam, fentanyl, cisatracurium, and potassium chloride, over the strong objections of the German pharmaceutical company Fresenius Kabi.

Potassium acetate had been incorrectly used in place of potassium chloride in Oklahoma in January 2015 for the execution of Charles Frederick Warner. In August 2017, the State of Florida first used the drug in the execution of Mark James Asay using a combination of etomidate, rocuronium bromide, and potassium acetate as part of a new protocol.
==Procedures==

===Procedure in the United States===
In the United States, the typical lethal injection begins with the condemned person being strapped onto a gurney; two intravenous cannulas (&quot;IVs&quot;) are then inserted, one in each arm. Only one is necessary to carry out the execution; the other is reserved as a backup in the event the primary line fails. A line leading from the IV line in an adjacent room is attached to the prisoner&#x27;s IV and secured so that the line does not snap during the injections.

The arm of the condemned person is swabbed with alcohol before the cannula is inserted. The needles and equipment used are sterilized. Questions have been raised about why these precautions against infection are performed despite the purpose of the injection being death. The several explanations include: cannulae are sterilized and have their quality heavily controlled during manufacture, so using sterile ones is a routine medical procedure. Secondly, the prisoner could receive a stay of execution after the cannulae have been inserted, as happened in the case of James Autry in October 1983. Third, use of unsterilized equipment would be a hazard to the prison personnel in case of an accidental needle stick injury.

Following connection of the lines, saline drips are started in both arms. This, too, is standard medical procedure: it must be ascertained that the IV lines are not blocked, ensuring the chemicals have not precipitated in the IV lines and blocked the needle, preventing the drugs from reaching the subject. A heart monitor is attached to the inmate.

In most states, the intravenous injection is a series of drugs given in a set sequence, designed to first induce unconsciousness followed by death through paralysis of respiratory muscles and/or by cardiac arrest through depolarization of cardiac muscle cells. The execution of the condemned in most states involves three separate injections (in sequential order):
#Sodium thiopental or pentobarbital: ultra-short-action barbiturate, an anesthetic agent used at a high dose that renders the person unconscious in less than 30 seconds. Depression of respiratory activity is one of the characteristic actions of this drug. Consequently, the lethal-injection doses, as described in the sodium thiopental section below, will—even in the absence of the following two drugs—cause death due to lack of breathing, as happens with overdoses of opioids.
#Pancuronium bromide: non-depolarizing muscle relaxant, which causes complete, fast, and sustained paralysis of the striated skeletal muscles, including the diaphragm and the rest of the respiratory muscles; this would eventually cause death by asphyxiation.
#Potassium chloride: a potassium salt, which increases the blood and cardiac concentration of potassium to stop the heart via an abnormal heartbeat and thus cause death by cardiac arrest.

The drugs are not mixed externally to avoid precipitation. A sequential injection is also key to achieve the desired effects in the appropriate order: administration of the pentobarbital renders the person unconscious; the infusion of the pancuronium bromide induces complete paralysis, including that of the lungs and diaphragm rendering the person unable to breathe.

If the person being executed were not already completely unconscious, the injection of a highly concentrated solution of potassium chloride could cause severe pain at the site of the IV line, as well as along the punctured vein; it interrupts the electrical activity of the heart muscle and causes it to stop beating, bringing about the death of the person being executed.

The intravenous tubing leads to a room next to the execution chamber, usually separated from the condemned by a curtain or wall. Typically, a prison employee trained in venipuncture inserts the needle, while a second prison employee orders, prepares, and loads the drugs into the lethal injection syringes. Two other staff members take each of the three syringes and secure them into the IVs. After the curtain is opened to allow the witnesses to see inside the chamber, the condemned person is then permitted to make a final statement. Following this, the warden signals that the execution may commence, and the (either prison staff or private citizens depending on the jurisdiction) then manually inject the three drugs in sequence. During the execution, the condemned&#x27;s cardiac rhythm is monitored.

Death is pronounced after cardiac activity stops. Death usually occurs within seven minutes, although, due to complications in finding a suitable vein, the whole procedure can take up to two hours, as was the case with the execution of Christopher Newton on May 24, 2007. According to state law, if a physician&#x27;s participation in the execution is prohibited for reasons of medical ethics, then the death ruling can be made by the state medical examiner&#x27;s office. After confirmation that death has occurred, a coroner signs the condemned&#x27;s death certificate.
Missouri and, before the abolition of capital punishment, Delaware, uses or used a lethal injection machine designed by Massachusetts-based Fred A. Leuchter consisting of two components: the delivery module and the control module. The delivery module is in the execution chamber. It must be pre-loaded with the proper chemicals and operates the timing of the dosage. The control module is in the control room. This is the portion which officially starts the procedure. This is done by first arming the machine, and then with station members simultaneously pressing each of their buttons on the panel to activate the delivery. The computer then deletes who actually started the syringes, so the participants are not aware if their syringe contained saline or one of the drugs necessary for execution (to assuage guilt in a manner similar to the blank cartridge in execution by firing squad).

The delivery module has eight syringes. The end syringes (i.e., syringes 7 and 8) containing saline, syringes 2, 4 and 6 containing the lethal drugs for the main line and syringes 1, 3 and 5 containing the injections for the backup line. The system was used in New Jersey before the abolition of the death penalty in 2007. Illinois previously used the computer, and Missouri and Delaware use the manual injection switch on the delivery panel.

Eleven states have switched, or have stated their intention to switch, to a one-drug lethal injection protocol. A one-drug method is using the single drug sodium thiopental to execute someone. The first state to switch to this method was Ohio, on December 8, 2009.

In 2011, after pressure by activist organizations, the manufacturers of pentobarbital and sodium thiopental halted the supply of the drugs to U.S. prisons performing lethal injections and required all resellers to do the same.

===Procedure in China===
In the past, the People&#x27;s Republic of China executed prisoners primarily by means of shooting. In recent years, lethal injection has become more common. The specific lethal injection procedures, including the drug or drugs used, are a state secret and not publicly known.

Lethal injection in China was legalized in 1996. The number of shooting executions slowly decreased; and, in February 2009, the Supreme People&#x27;s Court ordered the discontinuation of firing squads by the following year under the conclusion that injections were more humane to the prisoner. It has been suggested that the switch is also in response to executions being horrifying to the public. Lethal injections are less expensive than firing squads, with a single dose costing 300 yuan compared to 700 yuan for a shooting execution.

=== Procedure in Vietnam===
Prior to 2013, shooting was the primary method of execution in Vietnam. The use of lethal injection method was approved by the government in 2010, adopted in 2011, and then started being used in 2013. Urges to adopt other methods than lethal injection to replace the shooting execution began earlier, in 2006, after concerns of the mental state of the firing squad members after executions.

The drugs used consist of pancuronium bromide (paralytic), potassium chloride (cardiotoxin), and sodium thiopental (anesthetic). The production of these substances, however, is low in Vietnam. This led to drug shortages and to considering using other domestic poisons or the readoption of shootings.

The first prisoner in Vietnam to be executed by lethal injection, on August 6, 2013, was 27-year-old Nguyen Anh Tuan, arrested for murder and robbery. Between 2013 and 2016, 429 prisoners were executed by this method in the country.

==Drugs==

===Conventional lethal injection protocol===
Typically, three drugs are used in lethal injection. Pancuronium bromide (Pavulon) is used to cause muscle paralysis and decreased neural transmission to the lungs, potassium chloride to stop the heart, and midazolam for sedation.

====Pancuronium bromide (Pavulon)====

*Lethal injection dosage: 100 milligrams

Pancuronium bromide (Trade name: Pavulon): The related drug curare, like pancuronium, is a non-depolarizing muscle relaxant (a paralytic agent) that blocks the action of acetylcholine at the motor end-plate of the neuromuscular junction. Binding of acetylcholine to receptors on the end-plate causes depolarization and contraction of the muscle fiber; non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents like pancuronium stop this binding from taking place

The typical dose for pancuronium bromide in capital punishment by lethal injection is 0.2 mg/kg and the duration of paralysis is around 4 to 8 hours. Paralysis of respiratory muscles will lead to death in a considerably shorter time.

Pancuronium bromide is a derivative of the alkaloid malouetine from the plant &quot;Malouetia bequaertiana&quot;.

Instead of pancuronium, other drugs in use are succinylcholine chloride and tubocurarine chloride.

====Potassium chloride====

*Lethal injection dosage: 100 mEq (milliequivalents)

Potassium is an electrolyte, 98% of which is intracellular. The 2% remaining outside the cell has great implications for cells that generate action potentials. Doctors prescribe potassium for patients when potassium levels in the blood are insufficient, called hypokalemia. The potassium can be given orally, which is the safest route; or it can be given intravenously, in which case strict rules and hospital protocols govern the rate at which it is given.

The usual intravenous dose of 10–20 mEq per hour is given slowly since it takes time for the electrolyte to equilibrate into the cells. When used in state-sanctioned lethal injection, bolus potassium injection affects the electrical conduction of heart muscle and ultimately leads to cardiac arrest. The potassium bolus delivered for lethal injection causes a rapid onset of elevated extracellular potassium, also known as hyperkalemia, causing depolarization of the resting membrane potential of the heart muscle cells, particularly impacting the heart&#x27;s pacemaker cells. However, potassium&#x27;s effect on membrane potential is concentration dependent and ultimately occurs in two phases. Given the reference range for serum potassium is 3.5-5.5 mEq/L, concentrations up to 8 mEq/L shorten action potential duration and the refractory period due to an allosteric effect of potassium ions on potassium channels, leading to increased conduction velocity and subsequently quicker potassium efflux which contributes to quicker repolarization and the mentioned shortening of the refractory period. At approximately 8 mEq/L and beyond, the shortened refractory period and increased resting membrane potential diminishes the quantity of voltage-gated sodium channels ready to contribute to rapid phase 0 depolarization due to the inactivation gate requiring further repolarization to open back up. At potassium concentrations beyond 14mEq/L, enough sodium channels remain inactivated to no longer generate an action potential, ultimately leading to no heart beat. Heart potassium levels after lethal injection can reach 160.0 mEq/L. 

Depolarizing the muscle cell inhibits its ability to fire by reducing the available number of sodium channels (they are placed in an inactivated state). ECG changes vary depending on serum potassium concentrations and on the individual. Peaked T-waves signifying faster repolarization and potentially instances of early-repolarization and phase 2 re-entry (Brugada, Short QT, and Early-Repolarization Syndromes) are evident in the first phase of hyperkalemia. This progresses into a broadening and lengthening of the P wave and PR interval, then eventually disappearance of the P wave, widening of the QRS complex, and finally, asystole. This process can occur in the span of 30 to 60 seconds, but there have been cases of &#x27;botched&#x27; procedures, leading to one inmate gasping for air for approximately 10 to 13 minutes. 

====Sodium thiopental====

*Lethal injection dosage: 2–5 grams

Sodium thiopental (US trade name: Sodium Pentothal) is an ultra-short acting barbiturate, often used for anesthesia induction and for medically induced coma. The typical anesthesia induction dose is 0.35 grams. Loss of consciousness is induced within 30–45 seconds at the typical dose, while a 5 gram dose (14 times the normal dose) is likely to induce unconsciousness in 10 seconds.

A full medical dose of thiopental reaches the brain in about 30 seconds. This induces an unconscious state. Five to twenty minutes after injection, approximately 15% of the drug is in the brain, with the rest in other parts of the body.

The half-life of this drug is about 11.5 hours, and the concentration in the brain remains at around 5–10% of the total dose during that time. When a &#x27;mega-dose&#x27; is administered, as in state-sanctioned lethal injection, the concentration in the brain during the tail phase of the distribution remains higher than the peak concentration found in the induction dose for anesthesia, because repeated doses—or a single very high dose as in lethal injection—accumulate in high concentrations in body fat, from which the thiopental is gradually released. This is the reason why an ultra-short acting barbiturate, such as thiopental, can be used for long-term induction of medical coma.

Historically, thiopental has been one of the most commonly used and studied drugs for the induction of coma. Protocols vary for how it is given, but the typical doses are anywhere from 500 mg up to 1.5 grams. It is likely that this data was used to develop the initial protocols for state-sanctioned lethal injection, according to which one gram of thiopental was used to induce the coma. Now, most states use 5 grams to be absolutely certain the dosage is effective.

Pentobarbital was introduced at the end of 2010 due to a shortage of sodium thiopental, and has since become the primary sedative in lethal injections in the United States.

Barbiturates are the same class of drug used in medically assisted suicide. In euthanasia protocols, the typical dose of thiopental is 1.5 grams; the Dutch Euthanasia protocol indicates 1-1.5 grams or 2 grams in case of high barbiturate tolerance. The dose used for capital punishment is therefore about 3 times more than the dose used in euthanasia.

===New lethal injection protocols===
The Ohio protocol, developed after the incomplete execution of Romell Broom, aims to ensure the rapid and painless onset of anesthesia by only using sodium thiopental and eliminating the use of Pavulon and potassium as the second and third drugs, respectively. It also provides for a secondary fail-safe measure using intramuscular injection of midazolam, followed by sufentanil or hydromorphone in the event intravenous administration of the sodium thiopental proves problematic. The first state to switch to use midazolam as the first drug in a new three-drug protocol was Florida on October 15, 2013. Then on November 14, 2013, Ohio made the same move.

* Primary: Sodium thiopental, 5 grams, intravenous
* Secondary: Midazolam, 10 mg, intramuscular, sufentanil, 450 micrograms, intramuscular and/or hydromorphone, 40 mg, intramuscular

In the brief for the U.S. courts written by accessories, the State of Ohio implies that they were unable to find any physicians willing to participate in development of protocols for executions by lethal injection, as this would be a violation of medical ethics, such as the Geneva Promise, and such physicians would be thrown out of the medical community and shunned for engaging in such deeds, even if they could not lawfully be stripped of their license.

On December 8, 2009, Kenneth Biros became the first person executed using Ohio&#x27;s new single-drug execution protocol. He was pronounced dead at 11:47 am EST, 10 minutes after receiving the injection. On September 10, 2010, Washington became the second state to use the single-drug Ohio protocol with the execution of Cal Coburn Brown, who was proclaimed dead within two minutes after receiving the single-drug injection of sodium thiopental. Seven states (Arizona, Georgia, Idaho, Missouri, Ohio, South Dakota, and Texas) have used the single-drug execution protocol. The state of Washington used this single drug method, but stopped when execution was abolished. Five additional states (Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Tennessee) announced that they would switch to a single-drug protocol but, as of April 2014, had not executed anyone since switching protocols.

After sodium thiopental began being used in executions, Hospira, the only American company that made the drug, stopped manufacturing it due to its use in executions. The subsequent nationwide shortage of sodium thiopental led states to seek other drugs to use in executions. Pentobarbital, often used for animal euthanasia, was used as part of a three-drug cocktail for the first time on December 16, 2010, when John David Duty was executed in Oklahoma. It was then used as the drug in a single-drug execution for the first time on March 10, 2011, when Johnnie Baston was executed in Ohio.

==Euthanasia protocol==
Lethal injection has also been used in cases of euthanasia to facilitate voluntary death in patients with terminal or chronically painful conditions. Euthanasia can be accomplished either through oral, intravenous, or intramuscular administration of drugs. In individuals who are incapable of swallowing lethal doses of medication, an intravenous route is preferred. The following is a Dutch protocol for parenteral (intravenous) administration to obtain euthanasia, with the old protocol listed first and the new protocol listed second:

:First a coma is induced by intravenous administration of 1 g sodium thiopental (Nesdonal), if necessary, 1.5–2.0 g of the product in case of strong tolerance to barbiturates. Then, 45 mg alcuronium chloride (Alloferin) or 18 mg pancuronium bromide (Pavulon) is injected. To ensure optimal availability, these agents are preferably given intravenously. However, they can also be injected intramuscularly. In severe hepatitis or cirrhosis of the liver, alcuronium is the agent of first choice.

:Intravenous administration is the most reliable and rapid way to accomplish euthanasia, so can be safely recommended. A coma is first induced by intravenous administration of 20 mg/kg sodium thiopental in a small volume (10 ml physiological saline). Then, a triple intravenous dose of a nondepolarizing neuromuscular muscle relaxant is given, such as 20 mg pancuronium bromide or 20 mg vecuronium bromide (Norcuron). The muscle relaxant should preferably be given intravenously, to ensure optimal availability. Only for pancuronium dibromide, the agent may also be given intramuscularly in a dose of 40 mg.

A euthanasia machine may allow an individual to perform the process alone.

==Constitutionality in the United States==
In 2006, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Hill v. McDonough&quot; that death-row inmates in the United States could challenge the constitutionality of states&#x27; lethal injection procedures through a federal civil rights lawsuit. Since then, numerous death-row inmates have brought such challenges in the lower courts, claiming that lethal injection as practiced violates the ban on &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot; found in the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Lower courts evaluating these challenges have reached opposing conclusions. For example, courts have found that lethal injection as practiced in California, Florida, and Tennessee is unconstitutional. Other courts have found that lethal injection as practiced in Missouri, Arizona, and Oklahoma is constitutionally acceptable.

As of 2014, California has nearly 750 prisoners condemned to death by lethal injection despite the moratorium imposed when in 2006 a federal court found California&#x27;s lethal injection procedures to be unconstitutional. A newer lethal injection facility has been constructed at San Quentin State Prison which cost over $800,000, but it has yet to be used because a state court found that the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation violated the California Administrative Procedure Act by attempting to prevent public oversight when new injection procedures were being created.

On September 25, 2007, the United States Supreme Court agreed to hear a lethal-injection challenge arising from Kentucky, &quot;Baze v. Rees&quot;. In Baze, the Supreme Court addressed whether Kentucky&#x27;s particular lethal-injection procedure (using the standard three-drug protocol) comports with the Eighth Amendment; it also determined the proper legal standard by which lethal-injection challenges in general should be judged, all in an effort to bring some uniformity to how these claims are handled by the lower courts. Although uncertainty over whether executions in the United States would be put on hold during the period in which the United States Supreme Court considers the constitutionality of lethal injection initially arose after the court agreed to hear Baze, no executions took place during the period between when the court agreed to hear the case and when its ruling was announced, with the exception of one lethal injection in Texas hours after the court made its announcement.

On April 16, 2008, the Supreme Court rejected &quot;Baze v. Rees&quot;, thereby upholding Kentucky&#x27;s method of lethal injection in a majority 7–2 decision. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and David Souter dissented. Several states immediately indicated plans to proceed with executions.

The U.S. Supreme Court also upheld a modified lethal-injection protocol in the 2015 case &quot;Glossip v. Gross&quot;. By the time of that case, Oklahoma had altered its execution protocol to use midazolam instead of thiopental or pentobarbital; the latter two drugs had become unavailable for executions due to the European embargo on selling them to prisons. Inmates on Oklahoma&#x27;s death row alleged that the use of midazolam was unconstitutional, because the drug was not proven to render a person unconscious as thiobarbital would. The Supreme Court found that the prisoners failed to demonstrate that midazolam would create a high risk of severe pain, and that the prisoners had not provided an alternative, practical method of execution that would have a lower risk. Consequently, it ruled that the new method was permissible under the Eighth Amendment.

On March 15, 2018, Russell Bucklew, a Missouri death-row inmate who had been scheduled to be executed on May 21, 2014, appealed the constitutionality of lethal injection on an as-applied basis. The basis for Bucklew&#x27;s appeal was due to Bucklew&#x27;s allegation that his rare medical condition would interfere with the effects of the drugs, potentially causing him to choke on his own blood. On April 1, 2019, The Supreme Court ruled against Bucklew on the grounds that his proposed alternative to lethal injection, nitrogen hypoxia, was neither &quot;readily implemented&quot; nor established to &quot;significantly reduce a substantial risk of severe pain&quot;.
 Bucklew was executed on October 1, 2019.

==Ethics of lethal injection==

The American Medical Association (AMA) believes that a physician&#x27;s opinion on capital punishment is a personal decision. Since the AMA is founded on preserving life, they argue that a doctor &quot;should not be a participant&quot; in executions in any professional capacity with the exception of &quot;certifying death, provided that the condemned has been declared dead by another person&quot; and &quot;relieving the acute suffering of a condemned person while awaiting execution&quot;. The AMA, however, does not have the ability to enforce its prohibition of doctors from participation in lethal injection. As medical licensing is handled on the state level, it does not have the authority to revoke medical licenses.

Typically, most states do not require that physicians administer the drugs for lethal injection, but most states do require doctors, nurses or paramedics to prepare the substances before their application and to attest the inmate&#x27;s death after it.

Some states specifically detail that participation in a lethal injection is not to be considered practicing medicine. For example, Delaware law reads &quot;the administration of the required lethal substance or substances required by this section shall not be construed to be the practice of medicine and any pharmacist or pharmaceutical supplier is authorized to dispense drugs to the Commissioner or the Commissioner&#x27;s designee, without prescription, for carrying out the provisions of this section, notwithstanding any other provision of law&quot; (excerpt from Title 11, Chapter 42, § 4209). State law allows for the dispensing of the drugs/chemicals for lethal injection to the state&#x27;s department of corrections without a prescription. However, states are still subject to DEA regulation with respect to lethal injection drugs.

==Controversy==
===Opposition===
Opponents of lethal injection have voiced concerns that abuse, misuse and even criminal conduct is possible when there is not a proper chain of command and authority for the acquisition of death-inducing drugs.

====Awareness====
Opponents of lethal injection believe that it is not painless as practiced in the United States. They argue that thiopental is an ultrashort-acting barbiturate that may wear off (anesthesia awareness) and lead to consciousness and an uncomfortable death wherein the inmates are unable to express discomfort because they have been paralyzed by the paralytic agent.

Opponents point to sodium thiopental&#x27;s typical use as an induction agent and not in the maintenance phase of surgery because of its short-acting nature. Following the administration of thiopental, pancuronium bromide, a paralytic agent, is given. Opponents argue that pancuronium bromide not only dilutes the thiopental, but, as it paralyzes the inmate, also prevents the inmate from expressing pain. Additional concerns have been raised over whether inmates are administered an appropriate amount of thiopental owing to the rapid redistribution of the drug out of the brain to other parts of the body.

Additionally, opponents argue that the method of administration is also flawed. They contend that because the personnel administering the lethal injection lack expertise in anesthesia, the risk of failure to induce unconsciousness is greatly increased. In reference to this issue, Jay Chapman, the creator of the American method, said, &quot;It never occurred to me when we set this up that we&#x27;d have complete idiots administering the drugs&quot;. Opponents also argue that the dose of sodium thiopental must be set for each individual patient, and not restricted to a fixed protocol. Finally, they contend that remote administration may result in an increased risk that insufficient amounts of the lethal-injection drugs enter the inmate&#x27;s bloodstream.

In summary, opponents argue that the effect of dilution or of improper administration of thiopental is that the inmate dies an agonizing death through suffocation due to the paralytic effects of pancuronium bromide and the intense burning sensation caused by potassium chloride.

Opponents of lethal injection, as practiced, argue that the procedure is designed to create the appearance of serenity and a painless death, rather than actually providing it. Specifically, opponents object to the use of pancuronium bromide, arguing that it serves no useful purpose in lethal injection since the inmate is physically restrained. Therefore, the default function of pancuronium bromide would be to suppress the autonomic nervous system, specifically to stop breathing.

====Research====
In 2005, University of Miami researchers, in cooperation with the attorney representing death-row inmates from Virginia, published a research letter in the medical journal &quot;The Lancet&quot;. The article presented protocol information from Texas, Virginia, and North and South Carolina which showed that executioners had no anesthesia training, drugs were administered remotely with no monitoring for anesthesia, data were not recorded, and no peer review was done. Their analysis of toxicology reports from Arizona, Georgia, North and South Carolina showed that &quot;post mortem&quot; concentrations of thiopental in the blood were lower than that required for surgery in 43 of 49 executed inmates (88%), and that 21 (43%) inmates had concentrations consistent with awareness. This led the authors to conclude that a substantial probability existed that some of the inmates were aware and suffered extreme pain and distress during execution. The authors attributed the risk of consciousness among inmates to the lack of training and monitoring in the process, but carefully made no recommendations on how to alter the protocol or how to improve the process. Indeed, the authors conclude, &quot;because participation of doctors in protocol design or execution is ethically prohibited, adequate anesthesia cannot be certain. Therefore, to prevent unnecessary cruelty and suffering, cessation and public review of lethal injections is warranted&quot;.

Paid expert consultants on both sides of the lethal-injection debate have found opportunity to criticize the 2005 &quot;Lancet&quot; article. Subsequent to the initial publication in the &quot;Lancet&quot;, three letters to the editor and a response from the authors extended the analysis. The issue of contention is whether thiopental, like many lipid-soluble drugs, may be redistributed from blood into tissues after death, effectively lowering thiopental concentrations over time, or whether thiopental may distribute from tissues into the blood, effectively increasing &quot;post mortem&quot; blood concentrations over time. Given the near absence of scientific, peer-reviewed data on the topic of thiopental &quot;post mortem&quot; pharmacokinetics, the controversy continues in the lethal-injection community and, in consequence, many legal challenges to lethal injection have not used the &quot;Lancet&quot; article.

In 2007, the same group that authored the &quot;Lancet&quot; study extended its study of the lethal-injection process through a critical examination of the pharmacology of the barbiturate thiopental. This study – published in the online journal &quot;PLOS Medicine&quot; – confirmed and extended the conclusions made in the original article and goes further to disprove the assertion that the lethal-injection process is painless.

To date, these two studies by the University of Miami team serve as the only critical peer-reviewed examination of the pharmacology of the lethal-injection process.

====Cruel and unusual====
On occasion, difficulties inserting the intravenous needles have also occurred, with personnel sometimes taking over half an hour to find a suitable vein. Typically, the difficulty is found in convicts with diabetes or a history of intravenous drug use. Opponents argue that excessive time taken to insert intravenous lines is tantamount to cruel and unusual punishment. In addition, opponents point to instances where the intravenous line has failed, or when adverse reactions to drugs or unnecessary delays have happened during the process of execution.

On December 13, 2006, Angel Nieves Diaz was not executed successfully in Florida using a standard lethal-injection dose. Diaz was 55 years old and had been sentenced to death for murder. Diaz did not succumb to the lethal dose even after 35 minutes, necessitating a second dose of drugs to complete the execution. At first, a prison spokesman denied Diaz had suffered pain and claimed the second dose was needed because Diaz had some sort of liver disease. After performing an autopsy, the medical examiner, Dr. William Hamilton, stated that Diaz&#x27;s liver appeared normal, but that the needle had pierced through Diaz&#x27;s vein into his flesh. The deadly chemicals had subsequently been injected into soft tissue rather than into the vein. Two days after the execution, then-Governor Jeb Bush suspended all executions in the state and appointed a commission &quot;to consider the humanity and constitutionality of lethal injections.&quot; The ban was lifted by Governor Charlie Crist when he signed the death warrant for Mark Dean Schwab on July 18, 2007. On November 1, 2007, the Florida Supreme Court unanimously upheld the state&#x27;s lethal-injection procedures.

A study published in 2007 in &quot;PLOS Medicine&quot; suggested that &quot;the conventional view of lethal injection leading to an invariably peaceful and painless death is questionable&quot;.

The execution of Romell Broom was abandoned in Ohio on September 15, 2009, after prison officials failed to find a vein after two hours of trying on his arms, legs, hands, and ankle. This stirred up more intense debate in the United States about lethal injection. Broom&#x27;s execution was later rescheduled for March 2022, but he died in 2020 before the sentence could be carried out.

Dennis McGuire was executed in Lucasville, Ohio, on January 17, 2014. According to reporters, McGuire&#x27;s execution took more than 20 minutes, and he was gasping for air for 10–13 minutes after the drugs had been administered. It was the first use of a new drug combination which was introduced in Ohio after the European Union banned sodium thiopental exports. This reignited criticism of the conventional three-drug method.

Clayton Lockett died of a heart attack during a failed execution attempt on April 29, 2014, at Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, Oklahoma. Lockett was administered an untested mixture of drugs that had not previously been used for executions in the U.S. He survived for 43 minutes before being pronounced dead. Lockett convulsed and spoke during the process and attempted to rise from the execution table 14 minutes into the procedure, despite having been declared unconscious.

Lethal injection, by design, is outwardly ambiguous with respect to what can be seen by witnesses. The 8th amendment of the US constitution proscribes cruel punishment but only the punished can accurately gauge the experience of cruelty. In execution, the inmate is unable to be a witness to their own execution, so it falls on the assembled witnesses to decide. Eyewitnesses to execution report very different observations, and these differences range from an opinion that the execution was painless to comments that the execution was highly problematic. Post mortem examinations of inmates executed by lethal injection have revealed a common finding of heavily congested lungs consistent with pulmonary edema. The occurrence of pulmonary edema found at autopsy raises the question about the actual cruelty of lethal injection. If pulmonary edema occurs as a consequence of lethal injection, the experience of death may be more akin to drowning than simply the painless death described by lethal injection proponents. Pulmonary edema can only occur if the inmate has heart function and cannot occur after death.

====European Union export ban====
Due to its use for executions in the US, the UK introduced a ban on the export of sodium thiopental in December 2010, after it was established that no European supplies to the US were being used for any other purpose. The restrictions were based on &quot;the European Union Torture Regulation (including licensing of drugs used in execution by lethal injection)&quot;. From December 21, 2011, the European Union extended trade restrictions to prevent the export of certain medicinal products for capital punishment, stating, &quot;The Union disapproves of capital punishment in all circumstances and works towards its universal abolition&quot;.

===Support===

====Commonality====
The combination of a barbiturate induction agent and a nondepolarizing paralytic agent is used in thousands of anesthetics every day. Supporters of the death penalty argue that unless anesthesiologists have been wrong for the past 40 years, the use of pentothal and pancuronium is safe and effective. In fact, potassium is given in heart bypass surgery to induce cardioplegia. Therefore, the combination of these three drugs remains in use. Supporters of the death penalty speculate that the designers of the lethal-injection protocols intentionally used the same drugs as are used in everyday surgery to avoid controversy. The only modification is that a massive coma-inducing dose of barbiturates is given. In addition, similar protocols have been used in countries that support euthanasia or physician-assisted suicide.

====Anesthesia awareness====
Thiopental is a rapid and effective drug for inducing unconsciousness, since it causes loss of consciousness upon a single circulation through the brain due to its high lipophilicity. Only a few other drugs, such as methohexital, etomidate, or propofol, have the capability to induce anesthesia so rapidly. (Narcotics such as fentanyl are inadequate as induction agents for anesthesia.) Supporters argue that since the thiopental is given at a much higher dose than for medically induced coma protocols, it is effectively impossible for the condemned to wake up.

Anesthesia awareness occurs when general anesthesia is inadequately maintained, for a number of reasons. Typically, anesthesia is &#x27;induced&#x27; with an intravenous drug, but &#x27;maintained&#x27; with an inhaled anesthetic given by the anesthesiologist or nurse-anesthetist (note that there are several other methods for safely and effectively maintaining anesthesia). Barbiturates are used only for induction of anesthesia and although these drugs rapidly and reliably induce anesthesia, wear off quickly. A neuromuscular-blocking drug may then be given to cause paralysis which facilitates intubation, although this is not always required. The anesthesiologist or nurse-anesthetist is responsible for ensuring that the maintenance technique (typically inhalational) is started soon after induction to prevent the patient from waking up.

General anesthesia is not maintained with barbiturate drugs because they are so short-acting. An induction dose of thiopental wears off after a few minutes because the thiopental redistributes from the brain to the rest of the body very quickly. Also thiopental has a long half-life and needs time for the drug to be eliminated from the body. If a very large initial dose is given, little or no redistribution takes place because the body is saturated with the drug; thus recovery of consciousness requires the drug to be eliminated from the body. Because this process is not only slow (taking many hours or days), but also unpredictable in duration, barbiturates are unsatisfactory for the maintenance of anesthesia.

Thiopental has a half-life around 11.5 hours (but the action of a single dose is terminated within a few minutes by redistribution of the drug from the brain to peripheral tissues) and the long-acting barbiturate phenobarbital has a half-life around 4–5 days. In contrast, the inhaled anesthetics have extremely short half-lives and allow the patient to wake up rapidly and predictably after surgery.

The average time to death once a lethal-injection protocol has been started is about 7–11 minutes. Because it takes only about 30 seconds for the thiopental to induce anesthesia, 30–45 seconds for the pancuronium to cause paralysis, and about 30 seconds for the potassium to stop the heart, death can theoretically be attained in as little as 90 seconds. Given that it takes time to administer the drug, time for the line to flush itself, time for the change of the drug being administered, and time to ensure that death has occurred, the whole procedure takes about 7–11 minutes. Procedural aspects in pronouncing death also contribute to delay, so the condemned is usually pronounced dead within 10–20 minutes of starting the drugs. Supporters of the death penalty say that a huge dose of thiopental, which is between 14 and 20 times the anesthetic-induction dose and which has the potential to induce a medical coma lasting 60 hours, could never wear off in only 10–20 minutes.

====Dilution effect====
Death-penalty supporters state that the claim that pancuronium dilutes the sodium thiopental dose is erroneous. Supporters argue that pancuronium and thiopental are commonly used together in everyday surgery and that if there were a dilution effect, it would be a known drug interaction.

Drug interactions are a complex topic. Simplistically, drug interactions can be classified as either synergistic or inhibitory interactions. In addition, drug interactions can occur directly at the site of action through common pathways, or indirectly through metabolism of the drug in the liver or through elimination in the kidney. Pancuronium and thiopental have different sites of action, one in the brain and one at the neuromuscular junction. Since the half-life of thiopental is 11.5 hours, the metabolism of the drugs is not an issue when dealing with the short time frame in lethal injections. The only other plausible interpretation would be a direct one, or one in which the two compounds interact with each other. Supporters of the death penalty argue that this theory does not hold true. They state that even if the 100 mg of pancuronium directly prevented 500 mg of thiopental from working, sufficient thiopental to induce coma would be present for 50 hours. In addition, if this interaction did occur, then the pancuronium would be incapable of causing paralysis.

Supporters of the death penalty state that the claim that the pancuronium prevents the thiopental from working, yet is still capable of causing paralysis, is not based on any scientific evidence and is a drug interaction that has never before been documented for any other drugs.

===Single drug===
Terminally ill patients in Oregon who have requested physician-assisted suicide have received lethal doses of barbiturates. The protocol has been highly effective in producing a so-called painless death, but the time required to cause death can be prolonged. Some patients have taken days to die, and a few patients have actually survived the process and have regained consciousness up to three days after taking the lethal dose. In a California legal proceeding addressing the issue of the lethal-injection cocktail being &quot;cruel and unusual&quot;, state authorities said that the time to death following a single injection of a barbiturate could be as much as 45 minutes.

Barbiturate overdoses typically cause death by depression of the respiratory center, but the effect is variable. Some patients may have complete cessation of respiratory drive, whereas others may only have depression of respiratory function. In addition, cardiac activity can last for a long time after cessation of respiration. Since death is pronounced after asystole and given that the expectation is for a rapid death in lethal injection, multiple drugs are required, specifically potassium chloride to stop the heart. In fact, in the case of Clarence Ray Allen, a second dose of potassium chloride was required to attain.

===Stockpiling and sourcing of drugs===
A 2017 study found that four U.S. states that allow capital punishment are stockpiling lethal-injection drugs that are in short supply and may be needed for life-saving medical procedures elsewhere.
This stockpiling of lethal-injection drugs also extends to the federal level, with the source of such drugs being put into question. At least one alleged supplier, Absolute Standards, is neither registered with the FDA, nor registered as a controlled substances manufacturer with the DEA, and has seen investigations over its alleged involvement.

<text>Lenox Corporation is an American manufacturing company that sells tableware, giftware, and collectible products under the Lenox, Dansk, Reed &amp; Barton, Gorham, and Oneida brands. For most of the 20th century, it was the most prestigious American maker of tableware, and the company produced other decorative pieces as well. Several Lenox china services were commissioned for the White House. By 2020, it was the last significant manufacturer of bone china in the United States, until the COVID-19 pandemic forced the closure of the company&#x27;s only remaining American factory.

==History==
Lenox was founded in 1889 by Walter Scott Lenox as Lenox&#x27;s Ceramic Art Company in Trenton, New Jersey.

As Lenox&#x27;s products became popular in the early 20th century, the company expanded its production to a factory-style operation, making tableware in standard patterns while still relying on skilled handworking, especially for painting.
Two of the first patterns Lenox produced were introduced in 1917, the &quot;Ming&quot; and &quot;Mandarin&quot;, which were eventually manufactured for over fifty years. Lenox products also became well known in the United States thanks to Frank Graham Holmes, chief designer from 1905 to 1954, who won several artistic awards such as the 1927 Craftsmanship Medal of the American Institute of Architects and the 1943 silver medal of the American Designers Institute. Lenox pieces were the only American porcelain chosen for display in 1928 by the National Museum of Ceramics in Sèvres, France.

In 1983, Lenox was acquired by Brown-Forman Corporation. Brown-Forman acquired Dansk International Designs and its Gorham Manufacturing Company division in 1991, which were incorporated into Lenox. In 2005, Brown-Forman sold Lenox, Incorporated, to collectible manufacturer Department 56 for $190 million.

The Lenox company archives, not purchased by Department 56, were donated to several repositories. China-related archival documents were donated to the Rutgers University Libraries. The historical china collections were given to the Newark Museum and the New Jersey State Museum.

Lenox Sales, Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2008. On March 16, 2009, Clarion Capital Partners purchased the assets of Lenox and renamed the company Lenox Corporation. Lenox continued some manufacture of bone china dinnerware at its plant in Kinston, North Carolina, built in 1989. The plant is situated on . Its manufacturing capabilities included enamel dot, etch, color, and microwave metals, and eventually became Lenox&#x27;s only American factory until its closure in 2020.

In a bankruptcy auction conducted in April 2015, the operating assets of Reed &amp; Barton, a competing maker of flatware, were acquired by Lenox.

Lenox&#x27;s brands include Kate Spade New York, Marchesa by Lenox, and Brian Gluckstein by Lenox. 

Lenox ceased production at the Kinston factory on March 18, 2020, due to concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic; on April 17 the company announced that the closure would become permanent, with production expected to resume overseas.

In July 2020 Lenox announced that they would permanently close all of their outlet and warehouse stores, also citing the COVID-19 pandemic.

In October 2020, Lenox was acquired by private equity firm Centre Lane Partners.

In June 2021, Lenox acquired its erstwhile competitor Oneida.

==Presidential collection==

Lenox was the first North American bone china to be used in the White House, and the company has since made tableware for six U.S. presidents. They are officially titled:
*The Wilson Service: Designed by Frank Holmes. Delivered to the White House between August and November 1918. The pattern is a deep ivory border surrounding a brighter ivory body and two bands of matte gold encrusted with stars, stripes and other motifs. This first set of American made tableware of 1,700 pieces from Lenox cost $16,000.
*The Roosevelt Service: Ordered October 1934. It is described as patriotic, bearing a border of 48 gold stars, and the presidential seal in enamel colors on an ivory body.
*The Truman Service: Consisting of 1,572 pieces, the pattern includes a border of celadon green flanked by an etched gold band and a 24 karat gold rim on an ivory body. Delivered in early 1952.
*The Reagan Service: The pattern are bands of scarlet varying in width depending on the scale of the piece and are framed on each side with etched gold. The presidential seal, in raised gold, partially overlays the red border.
*The Clinton Service: The pattern features a border of pale creamy yellow, and images of the White House facades. Each piece in the place setting is decorated with a different pattern, the motifs derived from architectural elements found in the State Dining Room, East Room, and Diplomatic Reception Room. No presidential seal appears.
*The Bush Service: Laura Bush first displayed this newest service on January 7, 2009. The porcelain place setting service features a green basket weave border based on a French dinner service believed to have been owned by James and Dolley Madison. The dessert plates replicate a laurel wreath found on Madison&#x27;s Parisian c. 1799-1805 dinner plates. The serving plates and the rim of other pieces also feature an eagle emblem inspired by an American bald eagle inlay found on the center drawer of the Massachusetts sideboard, believed to have been owned by Daniel Webster.

<text>H. A. Rey (born Hans Augusto Reyersbach; September 16, 1898 – August 26, 1977) was a German-born American illustrator and author, known best for the series of children&#x27;s picture books that he and his wife Margret Rey created about &quot;Curious George&quot;.

==Early life==
Hans Augusto Reyersbach was born in Hamburg, German Empire on September 16, 1898. He and his wife, Margret, were both German Jews. They first met in Hamburg at Margret&#x27;s sister&#x27;s 16th birthday party. They met again in Brazil, where Rey was working as a salesman of bathtubs and Margret had gone to escape the rise of Nazism in Germany. They got married in 1935 and moved to Paris, France in August of that year. They lived in Montmartre and fled Paris in June 1940 on bicycles, carrying the &quot;Curious George&quot; manuscript with them.

== Curious George ==
While in Paris, Rey&#x27;s animal drawings came to the attention of a French publisher, who commissioned him to write a children&#x27;s book. The characters in &quot;Cecily G. and the Nine Monkeys&quot; included an impish monkey named Curious George, and the couple then decided to write a book focused entirely on him. The outbreak of World War II interrupted their work. Being Jews, the Reys decided to flee Paris before the Nazis invaded the city. Hans assembled two bicycles, and they left the city just a few hours before it fell. Among the meager possessions they brought with them was the illustrated manuscript of &quot;Curious George&quot;.

The Reys&#x27; odyssey took them to Bayonne, France, where they were issued life-saving visas signed by Portuguese Vice-Consul Manuel Vieira Braga (following instructions from Aristides de Sousa Mendes) on June 20, 1940. They crossed the Spanish border, where they bought train tickets to Lisbon. From there, they returned to Brazil, where they had met five years earlier, but this time they continued on to New York. The Reys escaped Europe carrying the manuscript to the first Curious George book, which was published in New York by Houghton Mifflin in 1941. They originally planned to use watercolor illustrations, but since they were responsible for the color separation, Rey changed these to the cartoon-like images that continue to be featured in each of the books. A collector&#x27;s edition with the original watercolors has since been released.

&quot;Curious George&quot; was an instant success, and the Reys were commissioned to write more adventures of the mischievous monkey and his friend, the Man with the Yellow Hat. They wrote seven stories in all, with Hans mainly doing the illustrations and Margret working mostly on the stories, though they both admitted to sharing the work and cooperating fully in every stage of development. At first, however, covers omitted Margret&#x27;s name. In later editions, this was changed, and Margret now receives full credit for her role in developing the stories. 

&quot;Curious George Takes a Job&quot; was named to the Lewis Carroll Shelf Award list in 1960.

In 1963, the Reys relocated to Cambridge, Massachusetts, in a house near Harvard Square, and lived there until Rey died on August 26, 1977.

In the 1990s, friends of the Reys founded a children&#x27;s bookstore named Curious George &amp; Friends (formerly Curious George Goes to Wordsworth), which operated in Harvard Square until 2011. A new Curious George themed store opened in 2012, The World&#x27;s Only Curious George Store, which moved to Central Square in 2019.

==Star charts==
Rey&#x27;s interest in astronomy began during World War I and led to his desire to redraw constellation diagrams, which Rey found difficult to remember, so that they were more intuitive. This led to the 1952 publication of &quot;The Stars: A New Way to See Them&quot; (). His constellation diagrams were adopted widely and now appear in many astronomy guides, such as Donald H. Menzel&#x27;s &quot;A Field Guide to the Stars and Planets&quot;. As of 2008 &quot;The Stars: A New Way to See Them&quot; and a simplified presentation for children called &quot;Find the Constellations&quot; are still in print. A new edition of &quot;Find the Constellations&quot; was released in 2008, updated with modern fonts, the new status of Pluto, and some more current measurements of planetary sizes and orbital radii.

==Collected papers==
The University of Oregon holds H. A. Rey papers dated 1940 to 1961, dominated by correspondence, primarily between Rey and his American and British publishers.

The de Grummond Children&#x27;s Literature Collection in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, holds more than 300 boxes of Rey papers dated 1973 to 2002.

Dr. Lena Y. de Grummond, a professor in the field of library science at the University of Southern Mississippi, contacted the Reys in 1966 about USM&#x27;s new children&#x27;s literature collection. H. A. and Margret donated a pair of sketches at the time. When Margret Rey died in 1996, her will designated that the entire literary estate of the Reys be donated to the de Grummond Collection.

<text>Margret Elizabeth Rey (born Margarete Elisabeth Waldstein; May 16, 1906 – December 21, 1996) was a German-born American writer and illustrator, best known for the &quot;Curious George&quot; series of children&#x27;s picture books that she and her husband H. A. Rey created from 1939 to 1966.

==Life==
Margarete Elisabeth Waldstein was born on May 16, 1906, in Hamburg, German Empire, the daughter of Gertrude (Rosenfeld) and Felix Waldstein. Her father was a member of the Reichstag. She studied art at Bauhaus in Dessau, Kunstakademie Düsseldorf, and the University of Munich between 1926 and 1928 and afterward worked in advertising. In 1935 she left Germany for Rio de Janeiro, in Brazil to escape Nazism (Nazi Germany) – and to meet Hans Reyersbach, a salesman and another German Jew from Hamburg, who had been a family friend. They married in 1935 and moved to Paris, France, in 1936.

While in Paris, Hans&#x27;s animal drawings came to the attention of a French publisher, who commissioned him to write a children&#x27;s book. The result, &quot;Cecily G. and the Nine Monkeys&quot;, is little remembered today, but one of its characters, an adorably impish monkey named Curious George, was such a success that the couple considered writing a book just about him. Their work was interrupted with the outbreak of World War II. As Jews, the Reys decided to flee from Paris before the Nazis seized the city. Hans built two bicycles, and they fled Paris just a few hours before it fell. Among the meager possessions they brought with them was the illustrated manuscript of &quot;Curious George&quot;.

The Reys&#x27; odyssey brought them to the France–Spain border to enter into Spain, where they bought train tickets to Lisbon, in Portugal. From there they returned to Brazil, where they had met five years earlier, but this time they continued to New York City in the United States. The books were published by Houghton Mifflin in 1941, though certain changes had to be introduced because of the technology of the time. Hans and Margret originally planned to use watercolors to illustrate the books, but since they were responsible for the color separation, he changed these to the cartoon-like images that continue to feature in each of the books. A collector&#x27;s edition with the original watercolors was released in 1998.

&quot;Curious George&quot; was an instant success, and the Reys were commissioned to write more adventures of the mischievous monkey and his friend, the Man with the Yellow Hat. They wrote seven stories in all, with Hans mainly doing the illustrations and Margret working mostly on the stories, though they both admitted to sharing the work and cooperating fully in every stage of development. At first, however, Margret&#x27;s name was left off the cover, ostensibly because there was a glut of women already writing children&#x27;s fiction. In later editions, this was corrected, and Margret now receives full credit for her role in developing the stories.

Margret and her husband moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1963, in a house close to Harvard Square. Following her husband&#x27;s death in 1977, Margret continued writing, and in 1979 she became a professor of Creative Writing at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts. From 1980 she collaborated with Alan Shalleck on a series of short films featuring Curious George and on more than two dozen additional books.

In 1989 Margret Rey established the Curious George Foundation to help creative children and prevent cruelty to animals. In 1996, she made major donations to the Boston Public Library and Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. She was also a long-time supporter of the Longy School of Music.

Rey died of a heart attack on December 21, 1996, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

==Collected papers==
The de Grummond Children&#x27;s Literature Collection in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, holds more than 300 boxes of Rey papers dated 1973 to 2002.

Dr. Lena Y. de Grummond, a professor in the field of library science at The University of Southern Mississippi, contacted the Reys in 1966 about USM&#x27;s new children&#x27;s literature collection. H. A. and Margret donated a pair of sketches at the time. When Margret Rey died in 1996, her will designated that the entire literary estate of the Reys would be donated to the de Grummond Collection.

<text>Abdel-Razak al-Yehiyeh or Abdul-Razzaq Al-Yahya (March 15, 1929 – March 9, 2020) born in Tantura, near Haifa, then in the British Mandate of Palestine, also known as Abu Anas, was a Palestinian politician who served as Interior Minister of the Palestinian National Authority.

Al-Yehiyeh trained as a military strategist and served as chief operations officer and then deputy chief-of-staff of the PLA brigade in Syria before 1967. In August 1968, he led an attempt to make PLA Syria brigades more independent of Syrian control, and was made PLA chief-of-staff by the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) Executive Committee. But with Syria opposed, he resigned to become military advisor to the PLO Executive Committee from 1969 and chief-of-staff of the Palestinian Armed Struggle Command (PASC) in February 1969.

He was reappointed to the PLA as commander-in-chief by the PLO Executive Committee in June 1969. Then when Yasser Arafat took on that role in September 1970, al-Yehiyeh became chief-of-staff of all Palestinian forces.

Due to Syrian pressure, he was replaced in 1971, becoming director of the PLO&#x27;s political department from 1971 to 1976, He was a member of the PLO Executive Committee from 1984 to 1991. Al-Yehiyeh headed security committees in talks with Israel from 1993 to 1995, including final status talks, and also headed negotiations on Hebron security arrangements and safe passage.

He was appointed as Interior Minister of the Palestinian Authority in June 2002, charged with overhauling Palestinian security forces. He was a member of the three-man delegation to Washington in August 2000. He was involved in security talks with Israel, and headed a centralized security apparatus for the Palestinian Authority.

Al-Yehiyeh left the PA cabinet in late 2002, feeling that Arafat had prevented him from making any significant reforms. He published his book &quot;Between militarism and politics&quot; in 2006, and he was working on publishing a new book about peace negotiations between the Palestinian National Authority PNA and Israel.

He was appointed Interior Minister on June 15, 2007.

== Private life ==
From his first marriage, he had 4 daughters: Jomana, Lina, Roula and Rejwan. After the death of his first wife, he remarried and had a daughter Rana, and a son, Anas.

<text>Éowyn () is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. She is a noblewoman of Rohan who describes herself as a shieldmaiden.

With the hobbit Merry Brandybuck, she rides into battle and kills the Witch-King of Angmar, Lord of the Nazgûl, in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. This fulfils the Macbeth-like prophecy that he would not be killed by a man.

Éowyn&#x27;s brief courtship by Faramir has been seen by scholars as influenced by Tolkien&#x27;s experience of war brides from the First World War. She has been seen, too, as one of the few strong female characters in the story, especially as interpreted in Peter Jackson&#x27;s film trilogy, where her role, played by Miranda Otto, is far more romantic than Tolkien made her.

==Narrative==

In &quot;The Two Towers&quot;, Éowyn, a daughter of the House of Eorl and the niece of King Théoden of Rohan, is introduced in Meduseld, the King&#x27;s hall at Edoras. She is the daughter of Éomund and Théodwyn (Théoden&#x27;s sister), and the sister of Éomer. When she is only seven years old, her father is killed fighting orcs, and her mother dies of grief. Éowyn and Éomer are raised in her uncle&#x27;s household as his own children.

She longs to win renown in battle—especially since she is royal—but being female, her duties are reckoned to be at Edoras. When Théoden&#x27;s mind is poisoned by his corrupt adviser Gríma Wormtongue, Éowyn is obliged to care for her uncle, and his deterioration pains her deeply. To make matters worse, she is constantly harassed by Gríma, who lusts after her. When Gandalf arrives, he frees Théoden from Wormtongue&#x27;s influence.
Éowyn falls in love with Aragorn, but though he respects her, he does not return her feelings, as he is betrothed to the elf Arwen. 
As Aragorn points out, her duty is with her people; she has to shoulder the responsibility of ruling Rohan in Théoden&#x27;s stead when the war-host of Rohan go to war.

Éowyn disguises herself as a man and, under the alias of &quot;Dernhelm&quot; (from Old English &quot;dern&quot; meaning &quot;secret, concealed&quot;), travels with the Riders of Rohan to the battle outside Minas Tirith in Gondor on her horse Windfola, carrying with her the hobbit Merry Brandybuck, who had also been ordered to remain behind.

In the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, she confronts the Witch-King of Angmar, Lord of the Nazgûl, after Théoden is mortally injured. The Witch-King threatens that he will &quot;bear thee away to the houses of lamentation, beyond all darkness, where thy flesh shall be devoured, and thy shrivelled mind be left naked to the Lidless Eye&quot;. He boasts &quot;No living man may hinder me&quot;, whereupon Éowyn removes her helmet and declares:

The Nazgûl leader&#x27;s flying steed attacks Éowyn, but she kills it, cutting off its head with her sword. The Nazgûl then shatters her shield and breaks her shield-arm with his mace, but is distracted by Merry, who stabs him behind the knee with a barrow-blade. Éowyn seizes the opportunity to strike the Nazgûl with a killing thrust &quot;between crown and mantle&quot;. Then, as her sword shatters, his withering form collapses and he vanishes with a final cry of anguish. Éowyn passes out from the pain in her arm, and is believed dead until Prince Imrahil realizes she still lives. Éowyn is brought to the Houses of Healing, hovering near death from the effects of having struck the Nazgûl. There Éowyn meets Faramir, with whom she soon falls in love. Her outlook on life also changes: &quot;Then the heart of Éowyn changed, or else at last she understood it. ... I will be a shieldmaiden no longer, nor vie with the great Riders, nor take joy only in the songs of slaying. I will be a healer, and love all things that grow and are not barren.&quot;

After the demise of Sauron, Éowyn and Faramir marry and settle in Ithilien, of which Faramir is made the ruling Prince by Aragorn. Faramir and Éowyn have a son, Elboron.

==Concept and creation==

Originally, Tolkien intended for Éowyn to marry Aragorn. Later, however, he decided against it because Aragorn was &quot;too old and lordly and grim&quot;. He considered making Éowyn the twin sister of Éomund, and having her die &quot;to avenge or save Théoden&quot;. He also considered having Aragorn truly love Éowyn and regret never marrying after her death. Tolkien once described Éowyn as &quot;a stern Amazon woman&quot;. Later he wrote: &quot;Though not a &#x27;dry nurse&#x27; in temper, she was also not really a soldier or &#x27;Amazon&#x27;, but like many brave women was capable of great military gallantry at a crisis.&quot; (Here he alludes to Éowyn&#x27;s statement to Aragorn: &quot;But am I not of the House of Eorl, a shieldmaiden and not a dry-nurse?&quot;)

In Old English, the language Tolkien used to represent his invented language of Rohirric, the word &quot;eoh&quot; means &quot;war-horse&quot; while &quot;wyn&quot; means &quot;delight&quot;, so &quot;Éowyn&quot; can be taken to mean &quot;Delight in horses&quot;. Her name in Rohirric is not given, but it would have started with the element &quot;Lô-&quot; or &quot;Loh-&quot;, meaning &quot;horse&quot;.

== Interpretations ==

Julaire Andelin, in the &quot;J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot;, writes that prophecy in Middle-earth depended on characters&#x27; understanding of the Music of the Ainur, the divine plan for Arda, and was often ambiguous. Thus, Glorfindel&#x27;s prophecy &quot;not by the hand of man will [the Lord of the Nazgûl] fall&quot; did not lead the Lord of the Nazgûl to suppose that he would die at the hands of a woman and a hobbit.
The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey states that the prophecy, and the Witch-king&#x27;s surprise at finding Dernhelm to be a woman, parallel the witches&#x27; statement to Macbeth that he may &quot;laugh to scorn / The power of man, for none of woman born / Shall harm Macbeth&quot; (Act 4, scene 1), and Macbeth&#x27;s shock at learning that Macduff &quot;was from his mother&#x27;s womb / Untimely ripp&#x27;d&quot; (as Macduff was born by Caesarean section: Act 5, scene 8). Thus, Shippey notes, despite Tolkien&#x27;s stated dislike of Shakespeare&#x27;s treatment of myth, he read &quot;Macbeth&quot; closely.

Tolkien&#x27;s First World War experience of war brides may be reflected in Éowyn&#x27;s brief courtship. The scholar of literature Melissa A. Smith notes that Tolkien wrote in response to criticism that &quot;In my experience feelings and decisions ripen very quickly (as measured by mere &#x27;clock-time&#x27;, which is actually not justly applicable) in periods of great stress, and especially under the expectation of imminent death&quot;. She notes that Tolkien indeed married Edith Bratt just before he was posted to the Western Front in France.
Thum states that Éowyn wears in turn two masks, the first unconventional, the second conventional. She appears initially as a medieval romance heroine, a &quot;woman clad in white&quot;, standing silent and obedient behind King Théoden&#x27;s throne. But soon it becomes clear that she is no meek subordinate, as &quot;she looked on the king with cool pity in her eyes&quot;: she thinks for herself. Further, she appears conventionally beautiful as a romance lady: &quot;Very fair was her face, and her long hair was like a river of gold.&quot; But, Thum writes, this too is swiftly gainsaid: &quot;Slender and tall she was ... but strong she seemed and stern as steel, a daughter of kings.&quot; Éowyn&#x27;s second mask is the appearance of a male Rider of Rohan, &quot;Dernhelm&quot;, as, against orders, she rides to battle. In Old English &quot;dern&quot; means &quot;secret, concealed&quot;, while &quot;helm&quot; is &quot;helmet&quot;, a covering for the head. Thum comments that this unconventional mask conveys Éowyn&#x27;s rebellious nature far more powerfully than would any overt account of her thinking.
Jessica Yates wrote that Éowyn meets all the requirements for a classic woman warrior: a strong identity; skill in fighting; weapons and armour; a horse; special powers, seen when she turns the Ringwraith&#x27;s prophecy of doom back onto him; and being modest and chaste. Carol Leibiger added that Éowyn is the only strong human female in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (Galadriel and Arwen being Elves), noting that her rejection of the woman&#x27;s place in the home leads her to fulfil the prophecy about the leader of the Ringwraiths, the Witch-King of Angmar, that &quot;not by the hand of man will [he] fall&quot;.
Melissa Hatcher wrote in &quot;Mythlore&quot; that &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; has as a central theme the way that &quot;the littlest person, a hobbit, overcom[es] the tides of war&quot;: that the real power is that of healing, protecting, and preserving. She noted that Éowyn tries the path of the warrior and then becomes a healer, and that some academics have interpreted her choice as weak submission. Hatcher stated that instead, Éowyn is following Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;highest ideal: a fierce commitment to peace&quot;, embodying the &quot;full-blooded subjectivity&quot; that Tolkien believed necessary for peace. She described Éowyn as &quot;a complete individual who fulfills Tolkien&#x27;s theme of peace, preservation, and cultural memory.&quot;
Hatcher cited the philosopher Gregory Bassham&#x27;s list of the six essential ingredients of happiness in Middle-earth, namely &quot;delight in simple things, making light of one&#x27;s troubles, getting personal, cultivating good character, cherishing and creating beauty, and rediscovering wonder&quot;, and stated that these are all seen in Éowyn and the Hobbit Sam, the gardener who inherits Frodo&#x27;s Bag End and restores the Shire, &quot;but in very few others&quot;.

== Portrayal in adaptations ==

=== Early films ===

Nellie Bellflower voiced Éowyn in the 1980 Rankin/Bass animated version of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;. Elin Jenkins voiced the character in BBC Radio&#x27;s 1981 serialisation. Éowyn appears briefly in Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s 1978 adaptation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

=== Peter Jackson ===

In Peter Jackson&#x27;s films &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; (2003), Éowyn is played by Miranda Otto. Uma Thurman was slated for the role at one point. 
Although Jackson cuts much of Tolkien&#x27;s poetry and song, he adds a scene with Éowyn singing a dirge at Théodred&#x27;s funeral.

Shippey states that the Hollywood studio sent a &quot;script doctor&quot; to New Zealand to bring Jackson&#x27;s direction into line with their view, which was that since Aragorn needed a single love interest, Arwen could be deleted and &quot;Aragorn should then marry Éowyn instead of politely dissuading her. ... The script doctor&#x27;s advice was ignored.&quot; 
Brian Robb and Paul Simpson concur with Shippey that Jackson does, however, make Aragorn far more romantic than do either Tolkien or Bakshi, devoting substantial viewing time to Aragorn&#x27;s &quot;modern love triangle&quot; and providing &quot;clear on-screen chemistry&quot; with Éowyn.

The scholar of English Helen Young writes that while neither Tolkien nor Jackson give Éowyn any thanks for killing the Witch-King, Jackson&#x27;s film version does at least invert the gender roles depicted by the Norwegian artist Peter Nicolai Arbo in his 19th century painting &quot;Hervor&#x27;s Death&quot;, though when she falls as if dead, the film scene looks in her opinion much like that in the painting. The film reduces Éowyn&#x27;s role as cup-bearer, which in Tolkien&#x27;s text describes a genuine Germanic ceremony in which a woman embodied the weaving of peace. Young suggests this was because the screenwriters feared the audience would misinterpret the scene. The extended edition of the &quot;Return to Edoras&quot; scene however includes the ceremony for Théoden.

The film scholar Sarah Kozloff writes that, if the film series can be seen as a melodrama, Jackson&#x27;s Éowyn symbolizes the modern &quot;tomboy/feminist&quot; psychic figure, the role being played &quot;in a realistic performance style&quot;.

Feminist scholar Penny Griffin writes that in &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;, Éowyn is &quot;probably the movies&#x27; closest approximation to an SFC [Strong Female Character]&quot;. Her credentials for this, Griffin notes, include rebelling against the injunction to stay behind when the Riders of Rohan go off to fight, disguising herself as a man, riding to battle, and fighting the leader of the Ringwraiths. The feminist effect is spoiled, Griffin notes, when her story ends (according to Tolkien&#x27;s text, not the film) with her disavowing battle and marrying Faramir to live &quot;happily every after&quot;.

The scholar of literature Maureen Thum comments that Jackson &quot;stresses what Tolkien implies&quot; by portraying Éowyn&#x27;s feelings for Aragorn and her skill in battle. Thum writes that Tolkien&#x27;s narrative, having Éowyn ride to war under the name &quot;Dernhelm&quot;, meaning &quot;secret helmet&quot;, far more powerfully conveys her rebellious nature than would any explicit description of her thinking.
The Tolkien scholar Jane Chance notes that Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Two Towers&quot; includes a moment of swordplay between Éowyn and Aragorn, the latter using a knife; Chance describes this as &quot;a scene of sexual symbolism nowhere found in Tolkien&#x27;s text&quot;.

In Kenji Kamiyama&#x27;s 2024 anime fantasy film &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim&quot;, a prequel to Jackson&#x27;s films, Otto reprised her role as Éowyn, while also serving as the film&#x27;s narrator.

<text>Éomer is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth. He appears in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as a leader of the Riders of Rohan who serve as cavalry to the army of Rohan, fighting against Mordor.

The name Éomer, meaning &quot;Horse-famous&quot; in Old English, is from &quot;Beowulf&quot;, a work that Tolkien had studied extensively. Despite the evident Old English connection, Tolkien denied that Éomer and the Riders of Rohan directly represented the Anglo-Saxons. Scholars have noted that while in a book the imagery remains ambiguous, and can combine suggestions of Gothic as well as Anglo-Saxon origins, film such as Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy inevitably has to choose. When Éomer appears in a helmet recalling the Sutton Hoo helmet, he is plainly Anglo-Saxon.

== Fictional account ==

=== Main text ===

Éomer is the son of Théodwyn and Éomund. After their parents&#x27; death Éomer and his sister Éowyn were adopted by their uncle Théoden, king of the Rohirrim. He is the leader of the forces of Rohan who attack and kill the Uruk-hai who had kidnapped the hobbits Merry Brandybuck and Pippin Took. Against orders, impressed by Aragorn, he helps Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas by lending them horses and guiding them to where the attack had taken place.

On his return to Edoras, Éomer reports this meeting to Théoden, and is imprisoned on the orders of Gríma Wormtongue, Théoden&#x27;s sinister advisor. Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas arrive in Edoras with the wizard Gandalf, who releases the king from Gríma&#x27;s spell. Éomer is set free and restored to honour. He fights at the battle of Helm&#x27;s Deep, where the forces of Rohan drive Saruman&#x27;s army of Orcs and Dunlendings from the walls of the Hornburg, buying enough time for Gandalf to arrive with Erkenbrand and his men of the Westfold of Rohan.

Éomer plays a major role in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the pivotal battle of &quot;The Return of the King&quot; against the forces of the Dark Lord Sauron from Mordor. After leading a successful cavalry charge, he is dismayed to find Théoden mortally wounded. Théoden appoints him King of Rohan with his dying breath. Seeing Éowyn seemingly dead on the battlefield, Éomer throws himself and the remaining Rohirrim at the enemy. Aragorn arrives unexpectedly from Pelargir, and joins forces with Éomer, fulfilling his prediction that they would meet in the midst of their enemies. They rout the Orcs and win the battle.

Éomer accompanies Aragorn to the Gates of Mordor for the final stand against Sauron, the Battle of the Morannon. This distracts Sauron long enough for the One Ring to be destroyed in Mount Doom, causing his immediate downfall. Théoden is taken back to Edoras to be buried, and Éomer becomes King of the Mark.
=== Appendices ===

The Appendices to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; add a few details. In 3021 of the Third Age, Éomer marries Lothíriel, only daughter of Imrahil, prince of Dol Amroth. She bears him a son, Elfwine the Fair, who becomes King of Rohan after his father. Tolkien fan fiction imagines many alternative lives for Lothíriel.

== Analysis ==
The name Éomer, meaning &quot;Horse-famous&quot; in Old English, occurs in &quot;Beowulf&quot;, at line 1959, as that of a king descended from Offa of Mercia. Tolkien had studied &quot;Beowulf&quot; extensively and drew material from it in writing &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

The critic Paul Kocher notes that in his first meeting with Aragorn on the plains of Rohan, Éomer is moved by affection more than just by the policy of the Mark, and indeed he risks both his command and his life by assisting Aragorn, contrary to orders.

The Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey contrasts Éomer&#x27;s behaviour with that of Faramir, son of the Ruling Steward of Gondor. In his view, Faramir is courteous, urbane, and civilised where Éomer is &quot;compulsively truculent&quot;, in both cases reflecting the character of their nations: Gondor &quot;a kind of Rome&quot;, subtle and calculating, Rohan a simple but vigorous Anglo-Saxon society. In his view, Rohan resembles Anglo-Saxon society in every way, except for one: the Anglo-Saxons did not like to fight on horseback.

Shippey writes further that prominent at the critical moment of the Battle of the Pelennor Fields, the decisive charge of the Riders of Rohan, is panache, which he explains means both &quot;the white horsetail on [Eomer&#x27;s] helm floating in his speed&quot; and &quot;the virtue of sudden onset, the dash that sweeps away resistance.&quot; Shippey notes that this allows Tolkien to display Rohan both as English, based on their Old English names and words like &quot;eored&quot; (troop of cavalry), and as &quot;alien, to offer a glimpse of the way land shapes people&quot;.

== Adaptations ==
In the 1978 animated adaptation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; by Ralph Bakshi, Éomer has no lines and is not fully animated.

In Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy, Éomer was played by the New Zealand actor Karl Urban.

The Tolkien scholar Michael Drout states that Jackson&#x27;s film version of Éomer&#x27;s helmet is plainly based on the Sutton Hoo helmet, &quot;the single most iconic image of Anglo-Saxon culture&quot;. Tolkien, he notes, had denied that the Riders of Rohan were actually the Anglo-Saxons, though he had made them speak the Mercian dialect of that language. In a book, Drout states, there can be ambiguity about visual images which are always partly in the reader&#x27;s imagination; but a film inevitably reduces that useful ambiguity. Éomer&#x27;s crest of horsetail, and the riders&#x27; flaxen hair give the impression of &quot;continental Gothic&quot; rather than Anglo-Saxons, but the film collapses that ambiguity. Drout further contrasts Jackson&#x27;s presentation of Éomer in close-up in his elaborate helmet (scene 11 of &quot;The Two Towers&quot;), with the later scene of an Easterling soldier whose helmet covers his face. Drout writes that this carries the suggestion of &quot;veiling and Orientalism&quot;, whereas Éomer&#x27;s face can be seen between his cheek-guards, making him seem more open and less threatening.

<text>Tom Bombadil is a character in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium. He first appeared in print in a 1934 poem called &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot;, which included &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; characters Goldberry (his wife), Old Man Willow (an evil tree in his forest) and the barrow-wight, from whom he rescues the hobbits. They were not then explicitly part of the older legends that became &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, and are not mentioned in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.

Bombadil is best known from his appearance as a supporting character in Tolkien&#x27;s novel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, published in 1954 and 1955. In the first volume, &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, Frodo Baggins and company meet Bombadil in the Old Forest. The idea for this meeting and the appearances of Old Man Willow and the barrow-wight can be found in some of Tolkien&#x27;s earliest notes for a sequel to &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. Bombadil is mentioned, but not seen, near the end of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, where Gandalf plans to pay him a long visit.

Tom Bombadil has been omitted in radio adaptations of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the 1978 animated film, and Peter Jackson&#x27;s film trilogy, as nonessential to the story.

Commentators have debated Bombadil&#x27;s role and origins. A likely source is the demigod Väinämöinen in the Finnish epic poem &quot;Kalevala&quot;, with many points of resemblance. Scholars have stated that he is the spirit of a place, a &quot;genius loci&quot;.

==Appearances==

===&quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot;===

The original version of Tolkien&#x27;s poem &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot; was published in 1934 in &quot;The Oxford Magazine&quot;. The poem depicts Bombadil as a &quot;merry fellow&quot; living in a small valley close to the Withywindle river, where he wanders and explores nature at his leisure. Several of the valley&#x27;s mysterious residents, including the &quot;River-woman&#x27;s daughter&quot; Goldberry, the malevolent tree-spirit Old Man Willow, the Badger-folk and a barrow-wight, attempt to capture Bombadil for their own ends. However, they quail at the power of his voice, which defeats their enchantments and commands them to return to their natural existence. At the end of the poem, Bombadil captures and marries Goldberry. Throughout the poem, he is unconcerned by the attempts to capture him and brushes them off with the power in his words.

Bombadil makes it clear that he found Goldberry in the Withywindle river, calling her &quot;River-woman&#x27;s daughter&quot;. The Tolkien scholar John D. Rateliff suggests that, at least in terms of Tolkien&#x27;s early mythology, she should be seen as one of the fays, spirits, and elementals (including the Maia): &quot;Thus Melian is a &#x27;fay&#x27;, (as, in all probability, are Goldberry and Bombadil; the one a nymph, the other a &quot;genius loci&quot;)&quot;.

The later poem &quot;Bombadil Goes Boating&quot; anchors Bombadil in Middle-earth, featuring a journey down the Withywindle to the Brandywine river, where Hobbits (&quot;Little Folk I know there&quot;) live at Hays-end. Bombadil is challenged by various river residents on his journey, including birds, otters, and Hobbits, but charms them all with his voice, ending his journey at the farm of Farmer Maggot, where he drinks ale and dances with the family. At the end of the poem, the charmed birds and otters work together to bring Bombadil&#x27;s boat home. The poem includes a reference to the Norse lay of Ótr, when Bombadil threatens to give the hide of a disrespectful otter to the barrow-wights, who he says will cover it with gold apart from a single whisker. The poem mentions Middle-earth locations including Hays-end, Bree, and the Tower Hills and speaks of &quot;Tall Watchers by the Ford, Shadows on the Marches&quot;.

=== &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; ===

In &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, Tom Bombadil helps Frodo Baggins and his Hobbit companions on their journey to destroy the Ring. Tom and his wife, Goldberry, the &quot;Daughter of the River&quot;, still live in their house by the source of the Withywindle, and some of the characters and situations from the original poem reappear.

Tom first appears when Merry and Pippin are trapped in the Old Forest by Old Man Willow, and Frodo and Sam cry for help. Tom commands Old Man Willow to release them, singing him to sleep.

The Hobbits spend two nights in Tom Bombadil&#x27;s house, which serves as one of Frodo&#x27;s five Homely Houses. Here it is seen that the One Ring has no power over Bombadil; he can see Frodo when the Ring makes him invisible to others and can wear it himself with no effect. He even tosses the Ring in the air and makes it disappear but then produces it from his other hand and returns it to Frodo. The idea of giving him the Ring for safekeeping is rejected in Book Two&#x27;s second chapter, &quot;The Council of Elrond&quot;. Gandalf says that it is unwise to consider Tom as having power over the Ring and that rather, &quot;the Ring has no power over him...&quot;. He suggests that Tom would not find the Ring to be very important and so might simply misplace it.

Before sending the Hobbits on their way, Tom teaches them a rhyme to summon him if they fall into danger again within his borders. This proves fortunate, as the four are trapped by a barrow-wight. After rescuing them, Tom gives each Hobbit a long dagger taken from the treasure in the barrow. He refuses to pass the borders of his own land, but he directs them to the Prancing Pony Inn at Bree.

Towards the end of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, when Gandalf leaves the Hobbits, he mentions that he wants to have a long talk with Bombadil, calling him a &quot;moss-gatherer&quot;. Gandalf says, in response to Frodo&#x27;s query of how well Bombadil is getting along, that Bombadil is &quot;as well as ever&quot;, &quot;quite untroubled&quot; and &quot;not much interested in anything that we have done and seen&quot;, save their visits to the Ents. At the very end of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, as Frodo sails into the West and leaves Middle-earth forever, he has what seems to him the very experience that appeared to him in the house of Bombadil in his dream of the second night.

== Creation and interpretations ==

=== Tolkien ===

Tolkien stated that he invented Tom Bombadil in memory of his children&#x27;s Dutch doll. His Bombadil poems far pre-date the writing of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, into which Tolkien introduced Tom Bombadil from the earliest drafts. In response to a letter, Tolkien described Tom in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as &quot;just an invention&quot; and &quot;not an important person – to the narrative&quot;, even if &quot;he represents something that I feel important, though I would not be prepared to analyse the feeling precisely. I would not, however, have left him in, if he did not have some kind of function.&quot; Specifically, Tolkien connected Tom in the letter to a renunciation of control, &quot;a delight in things for themselves without reference to yourself,&quot; &quot;Botany and Zoology (as sciences) and Poetry&quot;. In another letter, Tolkien writes that he does not think Tom is improved by philosophizing; he included the character &quot;because I had already &#x27;invented&#x27; him independently&quot; (in &quot;The Oxford Magazine&quot;) &quot;and wanted an &#x27;adventure&#x27; on the way&quot;. 

Tolkien commented further that &quot;even in a mythical Age there must be some enigmas, as there always are. Tom Bombadil is one (intentionally)&quot;. In a letter to Stanley Unwin, Tolkien called Tom Bombadil the spirit of the vanishing landscapes of Oxfordshire and Berkshire. However, this 1937 letter was in reference to works which pre-dated the writing of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.

Tolkien said little of Tom Bombadil&#x27;s origins, and the character does not fit neatly into the categories of beings Tolkien created. Bombadil calls himself the &quot;Eldest&quot; and the &quot;Master&quot;. He claims to remember &quot;the first raindrop and the first acorn&quot;, and that he &quot;knew the dark under the stars when it was fearless—before the Dark Lord came from Outside&quot;. When Frodo asks Goldberry just who Tom Bombadil is, she responds simply by saying &quot;He is&quot;. Some critics have taken this dialogue as a reference to God&#x27;s statement &quot;I Am that I Am&quot; in the Book of Exodus, an idea which Tolkien denied as an influence.

=== Väinämöinen ===

The scholar of folklore David Elton Gay writes that Tolkien was inspired by the poetry of the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, Elias Lönnrot&#x27;s 1849 collection of Finland&#x27;s oral tradition. Gay suggests with a detailed comparison that Tom Bombadil was directly modelled on the &quot;Kalevala&quot; central character, the demigod Väinämöinen.

=== Sauron&#x27;s opposite ===

The Tolkien scholar Verlyn Flieger writes that if there was an opposite to Sauron in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, it would not be Aragorn, his battlefield opponent, nor Gandalf, his spiritual enemy, but Tom Bombadil, the earthly Master who is entirely free of the desire to dominate, and hence cannot be dominated. The Christian scholar W. Christopher Stewart sees Bombadil as embodying the pursuit of knowledge purely for its own sake, driven only by his sense of wonder. In his view, this goes some way to explaining Bombadil&#x27;s indifference to the One Ring, whose only purpose is power and domination.

=== Multiple levels of meaning ===

Jane Beal, in the &quot;Journal of Tolkien Research&quot;, writes that Bombadil can be considered using &quot;the four levels of meaning found in medieval scriptural exegesis and literary interpretation&quot;. These are different ways of understanding a text, rather than necessarily contradicting each other.

=== Jungian interpretation ===

The psychologist, fiction author and camouflage expert Timothy R. O&#x27;Neill interpreted Bombadil from a Jungian perspective in &quot;The Individuated Hobbit: Jung, Tolkien, and the Archetypes of Middle-Earth&quot; (1979). O&#x27;Neill finds Bombadil to be the manifestation of the Self archetype and a vision of man&#x27;s beginning and destiny:

The Tolkien scholar Patrick Grant notes that &quot;Jung also talks of a common figure, the &#x27;vegetation numen,&#x27; king of the forest, who is associated with wood and water in a manner that recalls Tom Bombadil.&quot;

=== Early interpretations ===

Robert Foster, author of an early guide to Middle-earth, suggested in 1978 that Bombadil is one of the Maiar, angelic beings sent from Valinor.
The Tolkien scholar and philosopher Gene Hargrove argued in &quot;Mythlore&quot; in 1986 that Tolkien understood who Bombadil is, but purposefully made him enigmatic. Hargrove suggested that Tolkien left clues that Bombadil is one of the Valar, a god of Middle-Earth, specifically Aulë, the archangelic demigod who created the dwarves.

== Adaptations ==

Along with the adventures in Crickhollow, the Old Forest, and the Barrow-downs, Bombadil is omitted from Peter Jackson&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Jackson explained that this was because he and his co-writers felt that the character does little to advance the story, and including him would make the film unnecessarily long. Christopher Lee concurred, stating the scenes were left out to make time for showing Saruman&#x27;s capture of Gandalf.

Bombadil has appeared in other radio and film adaptations. He was played by Norman Shelley in the 1955–1956 BBC radio adaptation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, a performance that Tolkien thought &quot;dreadful&quot;; in his view even worse was that Goldberry was announced as his daughter and Willowman &quot;an ally of &quot; (his emphasis). He was portrayed by Esko Hukkanen in the 1993 Finnish miniseries &quot;Hobitit&quot;. He appeared, too, in the 1979 Mind&#x27;s Eye recordings, where he was played by Bernard Mayes, who also voiced Gandalf.

He was included, along with Goldberry and the Barrow-wight, in the 1991 Russian adaptation of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, &quot;Khraniteli&quot;.

Tom Bombadil is portrayed by Rory Kinnear in the second season of &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power&quot;.

Although Bombadil was not portrayed in Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s or Jackson&#x27;s films, a Tom Bombadil card exists in &quot;The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game&quot; by Decipher, Inc. (part of the trilogy&#x27;s merchandise). The model portraying Bombadil on this card is Harry Wellerchew. Bombadil is a non-player character in the MMORPG game &quot;The Lord of the Rings Online&quot;, serving as a main character in Book 1 of the epic quests.

Bombadil appears as a playable character in the LEGO &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Hobbit&quot; video games. He has no impact in the main story for either game, as the games are direct adaptations of the Peter Jackson films rather than the original novels, but he later appears as an unlockable character in the Middle Earth hub world and can be used in free-play mode. He appears, too, on a &quot;God&quot; type card in the &quot;&quot; expansion &quot;The Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-earth&quot;.

The 1969 &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot; novel &quot;Bored of the Rings&quot; parodies Tom Bombadil as &quot;Tim Benzedrine&quot;, a stereotypical hippie married to &quot;Hash-berry&quot;. One of his songs is rewritten as:

<doc id="62767" wikidata="Q719492" url="?curid=62767" title="Radagast">
<text>Radagast the Brown is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s legendarium. A wizard and associate of Gandalf, he appears briefly in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, and &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot;. 

His role in Tolkien&#x27;s writings is so slight that it has been described as a plot device, though scholars have noted his contribution to the evident paganism in Middle-earth. He played a more significant role in Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot; film series, where he was portrayed by Sylvester McCoy. Some aspects of his characterisation were invented for the films, but the core elements of his character - namely communing with animals, skill with herbs, and shamanistic ability to change his shape and colours - are all described in Tolkien&#x27;s works. He is also a character in role-playing video games based on Tolkien&#x27;s writings.

== Appearances ==

&quot;Unfinished Tales&quot; explains that Radagast, like the other Wizards, came from Valinor around the year 1000 of the Third Age of Middle-earth and was one of the angelic Maiar. His original name is said to have been &quot;Aiwendil&quot;, meaning &quot;bird-friend&quot; in Tolkien&#x27;s invented language of Quenya. Yavanna, one of the god-like Valar, forces Radagast&#x27;s fellow wizard Saruman to accept him as a companion, which, Tolkien says, may have been one of the reasons Saruman was contemptuous of him, to the point of scornfully calling him &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;a fool&quot;. However, he is an ally and confidant of Gandalf, who describes him in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as his &quot;cousin&quot;. He is a friend of the skin-changer Beorn, something that Gandalf relies upon to get his party of Dwarves and a Hobbit accepted by a sceptical Beorn.

Radagast lives at Rhosgobel on the western eaves of Mirkwood, its name deriving from Sindarin &quot;rhosc gobel&quot; meaning &quot;brown village&quot;. Radagast has a strong affinity for—and relationship with—wild animals. It is said he speaks the many tongues of birds, and is a &quot;master of shapes and changes of hue&quot;. Radagast is described by Gandalf as &quot;never a traveller, unless driven by great need&quot;, &quot;a worthy Wizard&quot;, and &quot;honest&quot;.

In &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, during the Council of Elrond, Gandalf tells of a previous encounter with Radagast. Radagast was unwittingly used by Saruman to lure Gandalf to his tower of Orthanc, where Gandalf was captured. Fortuitously, Radagast also helped rescue him by sending Gwaihir the eagle to Orthanc with news of the movements of Sauron&#x27;s forces. When Gwaihir saw that Gandalf was imprisoned on the top of the tower he carried him off to safety. The only other reference to Radagast in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; is after the Council of Elrond when scouts are sent out. It is reported that Radagast is not at his home at Rhosgobel.

&quot;The Silmarillion&quot; briefly summarizes the same events in &quot;Of the Rings of Power and the Third Age&quot;, stating that Radagast is &quot;the friend of all birds and beasts&quot;, and noting that he innocently helps Saruman to assemble &quot;a great host of spies&quot; including many birds.

== Etymology and origins ==

The in-fiction etymology, according to the essay &quot;The Istari&quot; in &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot;, is that the name &quot;Radagast&quot; means &quot;tender of beasts&quot; in Adûnaic, one of Tolkien&#x27;s fictional languages. However, Christopher Tolkien says that his father intended to change this derivation and bring Radagast in line with the other wizard-names, Gandalf and Saruman, by associating it with the old language of the Men of the Vales of Anduin. No alternative meaning is provided with this new association; indeed, Tolkien stated that the name was &quot;not now clearly interpretable&quot;. His title &quot;The Brown&quot; is simply a reference to his earth-brown robes; each of the wizards has a cloak of a different colour.

The name Radagast is found in Edward Gibbon&#x27;s 1776–1789 &quot;Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, in the form &quot;Radagaisus&quot;, the name of a Gothic king. Slavic mythology contains a god named Radegast; this has been interpreted as &quot;welcome guest&quot;, making him the god of hospitality. Tolkien&#x27;s wizard may represent an echo of this Slavic tradition, a rare source among all the diverse influences on Tolkien&#x27;s writings.

Tolkien wrote that Josef Madlener&#x27;s &quot;Der Berggeist&quot;, which shows a man in a hat seated in a forest, communing with a wild deer, inspired his Gandalf and set him thinking about the wizards Gandalf, Saruman, and Radagast.

==Interpretations==

Radagast appears so briefly that he has been described as a plot device for Saruman&#x27;s treachery, rather than a genuine character. From the clues given, that he is a &quot;master of shapes and a changer of hues&quot;, his friendship and communication with animals, and his skill in herbs, he resembles a shaman. He has been described as &quot;one of the most interesting enigmas in Tolkien&#x27;s writings&quot;; given the treason of Saruman, he and Gandalf are the only two wizards available to counter Sauron, but Radagast fails to answer Elrond&#x27;s call.

In a letter, Tolkien wrote that Radagast gave up his mission as a Wizard by becoming too obsessed with animals and plants, but stated that he did not believe that Radagast&#x27;s failure was as great as Saruman&#x27;s. Christopher Tolkien commented that Radagast might not have failed completely, as he was specifically chosen by the Vala Yavanna for a mission to protect the plants and animals.

The Tolkien scholar Patrick Curry writes that the Slavic Radagast is the pagan patron of the Czech Beskyd mountains, depicted with a bird atop his horned helmet. In his view, this suggests that Tolkien&#x27;s Radagast is one of many examples of paganism in Middle-earth.

==Adaptations==

===In film===
In Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&quot;, Radagast is played by Sylvester McCoy, and is expanded far beyond his brief role in the book. McCoy stated that he saw Radagast as &quot;very otherworldly with, as Tolkien depicts him, an empathy and kinship with nature, a Middle-earth version of St Francis of Assisi&quot;. McCoy added that while Radagast was rather absent-minded, he comes out as &quot;a bumbling hero&quot;. As for his house, McCoy said that the idea was that the tree decided to grow right through it, and Radagast agreed that he and the tree could live together. In the film, Radagast is the first wizard to visit Dol Guldur after he realizes that an evil power has infected the wood in which he lives. He discovers that a Necromancer (who turns out to be Sauron) has taken residence in the ruined fortress. In Dol Guldur he encounters the spirit of the Witch-king of Angmar, as well as the shadow of the Necromancer himself, and escapes with the Morgul blade taken from the Witch-king. Radagast&#x27;s means of transportation is a sled pulled by enormous rabbits, a concept entirely original to the movie. Radagast meets Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the Dwarves en route to Erebor, and tells them of his discovery in Dol Guldur. When Thorin&#x27;s Company are attacked by Orcs riding Wargs, Radagast mounts his sled and provides a distraction. Later, Saruman makes contemptuous remarks about Radagast during a meeting with Gandalf, Elrond, and Galadriel. The writer Brian Sibley comments that the fact that Tolkien said little about Radagast gave Jackson&#x27;s screenwriters freedom to make of the character what they liked. &quot;The Economist&quot; wrote that Radagast the Brown had been created from Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;sparse and bare&quot; hints as to his character. The sled chase was filmed in the Strath Taieri glacial valley of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island, strewn with real boulders.

In &quot;The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug&quot;, Radagast appears with Gandalf in a few scenes. The two wizards investigate an empty tomb, determining that the Nazgûl are once again awake and have been summoned. Gandalf bids Radagast to go and tell Galadriel of all they find, and that the White Council must make a pre-emptive move on Dol Guldur. Inside the ruins, Gandalf confronts the Necromancer and finds that he is indeed Sauron, just as Radagast had thought.

In &quot;The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies&quot;, Radagast arrives in Dol Guldur as the White Council battle Sauron and the Nazgûl, and carries the wounded Gandalf on his sled. In the final battle, Radagast leads a charge of the Great Eagles at the end of the battle to assist the Dwarves, Men, and Elves against the Orcs.

===In games===

Radagast features in computer and video games such as those from Games Workshop. He plays an expanded role in the massively multiplayer online role-playing game &quot;The Lord of the Rings Online&quot;, which makes him a leader in a part of Middle-earth, allowing players to interact with him.

The scientific name &quot;Anacamptis&quot; derives from Greek ανακάμτειν &#x27;anakamptein&#x27; meaning &#x27;bend forward&#x27;, while the Latin name &quot;pyramidalis&quot; refers to the pyramidal form of the inflorescence.

== Description ==

This hardy plant reaches on average of height, with a maximum of . The stem is erect and unbranched. The basal leaves are linear-lanceolate with parallel venation, up to long, the cauline ones are shorter and barely visible on the stem. The arrangement of hermaphroditic flowers in a compact pyramidal shape is very distinctive and gives the orchid its common name. The colour of the flower varies from pink to purple, or rarely white, and the scent is described as &quot;foxy&quot;. The flowers have six tepals, being three small sepals and three petals. Two small petals are on the sides, while the third and lower (labellum) is large and trilobate. At the back of the flower there is a tubular spur of about long, while the labellum bears two lateral small flaps. The flowering period extends from April through July.

== Habitat and distribution ==

&quot;Anacamptis pyramidalis&quot; requires a sunny spot on diverse soils: loamy or clay. It can even grow on very alkaline soil. It can be found on meadows, in grassland, sand dunes, maquis as well as dry and well exposed slopes, at an altitude of above sea level.

In the UK, &quot;Anacamptis pyramidalis&quot; is a very successful coloniser of disturbed soil, and can grow in a wide variety of locations, including road verges, reservoirs, quarries and airfields.

This orchid is native to southwestern Eurasia, from western Europe through the Mediterranean region eastwards to Iran. In Germany, it is rare and was declared Orchid of the Year in 1990 to heighten awareness of this plant. 
This orchid is especially common on the Isle of Wight in the South of England, and was designated the county plant in 2008. On the Isle of Wight, it favours growth in chalky or sandstone-rich soil, and thus can easily be found on the Downland and cliffs to the west and south of the island.

== Ecology ==
The flowers are pollinated by butterflies and moths. To ensure the fertilization, their morphology is well adapted to the proboscis of Lepidoptera, especially &quot;Euphydryas&quot;, &quot;Melanargia&quot;, &quot;Melitaea&quot;, &quot;Pieris&quot; and &quot;Zygaena&quot; species. The mechanism by which its pairs of pollinia attach themselves to an insect&#x27;s proboscis was discovered by Charles Darwin and described in his book on the &quot;Fertilisation of Orchids&quot;.

&quot;Anacamptis pyramidalis&quot; has been suggested to form mycorrhizal relationships with &quot;Rhizoctonia&quot;, &quot;Fusarium&quot; and &quot;Papulaspora&quot; species.

==Varieties==
There are some notable varieties, which are sometimes treated as subspecies – and as they seem to be limited to certain regions, this may be correct:

* &quot;Anacamptis pyramidalis&quot; var. &quot;tanayensis&quot; – Tanay Pyramidal Orchid - Flowers darker and smaller. Fribourg and Valais cantons (Switzerland).
* &quot;Anacamptis pyramidalis&quot; var. &quot;urvilleana&quot; – Maltese Pyramidal Orchid, an endemic orchid from Malta with smaller and paler flowers flowering four–six weeks before &quot;Anacamptis pyramidalis&quot;.
* &quot;Anacamptis pyramidalis&quot; var. &quot;sanguinea&quot; – Western Irish Pyramidal Orchid. -Inflorescence rounder, plant smaller overall. County Galway to County Kerry (Ireland)

The variety &quot;alba&quot; can be found anywhere in the Pyramidal Orchid&#x27;s range; its flowers are white.

==Medicinal uses==

The dried and ground tuber (from various species of &quot;Orchis&quot; and &quot;Anacamptis&quot;) can be made into a fine white powder, called salep. This is a very nutritious sweet starchlike substance. It is used in drinks, cereals and in making bread. In Turkey it is used in ice-creams. It was also used medicinally in diets for children and convalescents.

== Culture ==
The pyramidal orchid was voted the County flower of the Isle of Wight in 2002 following a poll by the wild flora conservation charity Plantlife.

<text>Gymnadenia conopsea, commonly known as the fragrant orchid or chalk fragrant orchid, is a herbaceous plant of the family Orchidaceae native to northern Europe.

== Etymology ==
The name of the genus &quot;Gymnadenia&quot; is formed from Greek words (&#x27;, &quot;nude&quot;) and (&#x27;, &quot;gland&quot;) and refers to the characteristics of the organs for secreting nectar. The specific Latin name &quot;conopsea&quot; derives from the Greek &#x27; (&#x27;), literally meaning &quot;mosquito-like&quot;, probably because of the similarity of the long spur of the flower with the mouthparts of a mosquito.

The scientific binomial name of this plant was initially &quot;Orchis conopsea&quot;, proposed by the Swedish naturalist and botanist Carl von Linné (1707–1778) in his &#x27; of 1753. The name has been subsequently amended to the one currently accepted (&quot;Gymnadenia conopsea&quot;), by the British botanist Robert Brown (1773–1858) in 1813. In German, this plant is called &#x27; or &#x27;; in French, is called &#x27; or &#x27;; in Italy, it is called &#x27; (&quot;pink hand&quot;); in Croatian, it is known under &quot;&quot;.

== Description ==


&quot;Gymnadenia conopsea&quot; reaches on average of height, with a maximum of . These plants are tuberous geophytes, as they bring their buds in underground tuber, organs that annually produce new stems, leaves and flowers. These orchids are &quot;terrestrial&quot; because unlike &quot;epiphytic&quot; species, they do not grow on other plants of major sizes.

The stem is leafy and robust, with a striated surface. The leaves are long, narrow and lanceolate and vary from 3 to 7. The leaf color is gray-green. Size of leaf: width 1 to 2 cm, length 10 – 25 cm.

These orchids have two ovoidal bulbs, deeply webbed and with many small and short lobes. Size of tubers: 1 to 3.5 cm.

The inflorescence is long and it is composed of flowers gathered in dense cylindrical spikes (up to 50 flowers per spike). These inflorescences are scented and genes underlying eugenol (a volatile scent compound) production have been identified in Gymnadenia conopsea, G. odoratissima and G. densiflora. The flowers are petiolated, placed in the axils of long bracts and reach on average . They have a distinctive three lobed lip and long spurs. Their light scent is similar to cloves. Their colors vary from white and pink to pink-purple, more rarely white. These flowers bloom in the Summer, from June to July. They are hermaphrodite and pollinated by insects (entomophily), including moths.

== Ecology ==
The species is almost exclusively pollinated by moths (Lepidoptera). The most common pollinators are the small elephant hawk-moth (&quot;Deilephila porcellus&quot;), hummingbird hawk-moth (&quot;Macroglossum stellatarum&quot;), silver Y (&quot;Autographa gamma&quot;), burnished brass (&quot;Diachrysia chrysitis&quot;) and large yellow underwing (&quot;Noctua pronuba&quot;). Fruit set is high with an average of 73%.

The seed&#x27;s germination is conditioned by the presence of mycorrhizal fungi. &quot;Gymnadenia conopsea&quot; is held to be a mycorrhizal generalist, able to form associations with a variety of different fungal species including species in the Tulasnellaceae, Ceratobasidiaceae and Pezizales.

== Distribution ==
This plant is quite common throughout northern Europe with the exception of the Dinaric Alps. In Asia it is common in areas to the north of the Himalayas.
&quot;Gymnadenia conopsea&quot; ssp. &quot;borealis&quot; has been recorded from Co. Donegal, Ireland in 2004.

== Habitat ==
This species&#x27; habitat includes mountain meadows and pastures, grassland and fens. They grow on siliceous and calcareous substrate, mildly damp and with low nutritional value, at an altitude of above sea level.

<doc id="62775" wikidata="Q7239192" url="?curid=62775" title="Pre-abelian category">
<text>In mathematics, specifically in category theory, a pre-abelian category is an additive category that has all kernels and cokernels.

Spelled out in more detail, this means that a category C is pre-abelian if:
# C is preadditive, that is enriched over the monoidal category of abelian groups (equivalently, all hom-sets in C are abelian groups and composition of morphisms is bilinear);
# C has all finite products (equivalently, all finite coproducts); note that because C is also preadditive, finite products are the same as finite coproducts, making them biproducts;
# given any morphism &quot;f&quot;: &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; in C, the equaliser of &quot;f&quot; and the zero morphism from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; exists (this is by definition the kernel of &quot;f&quot;), as does the coequaliser (this is by definition the cokernel of &quot;f&quot;).
Note that the zero morphism in item 3 can be identified as the identity element of the hom-set Hom(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;), which is an abelian group by item 1; or as the unique morphism &quot;A&quot; → 0 → &quot;B&quot;, where 0 is a zero object, guaranteed to exist by item 2.

== Examples ==

The original example of an additive category is the category Ab of abelian groups.
Ab is preadditive because it is a closed monoidal category, the biproduct in Ab is the finite direct sum, the kernel is inclusion of the ordinary kernel from group theory and the cokernel is the quotient map onto the ordinary cokernel from group theory.

Other common examples:
* The category of (left) modules over a ring &quot;R&quot;, in particular:
** the category of vector spaces over a field &quot;K&quot;.
* The category of (Hausdorff) abelian topological groups.
* The category of Banach spaces.
* The category of Fréchet spaces.
* The category of (Hausdorff) bornological spaces.
These will give you an idea of what to think of; for more examples, see abelian category (every abelian category is pre-abelian).

== Elementary properties ==

Every pre-abelian category is of course an additive category, and many basic properties of these categories are described under that subject. This article concerns itself with the properties that hold specifically because of the existence of kernels and cokernels.

Although kernels and cokernels are special kinds of equalisers and coequalisers, a pre-abelian category actually has &quot;all&quot; equalisers and coequalisers.
We simply construct the equaliser of two morphisms &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; as the kernel of their difference &quot;g&quot; − &quot;f&quot;; similarly, their coequaliser is the cokernel of their difference.
(The alternative term &quot;difference kernel&quot; for binary equalisers derives from this fact.)
Since pre-abelian categories have all finite products and coproducts (the biproducts) and all binary equalisers and coequalisers (as just described), then by a general theorem of category theory, they have all finite limits and colimits.
That is, pre-abelian categories are finitely complete.

The existence of both kernels and cokernels gives a notion of image and coimage.
We can define these as
:im &quot;f&quot; := ker coker &quot;f&quot;;
:coim &quot;f&quot; := coker ker &quot;f&quot;.
That is, the image is the kernel of the cokernel, and the coimage is the cokernel of the kernel.

Note that this notion of image may not correspond to the usual notion of image, or range, of a function, even assuming that the morphisms in the category &quot;are&quot; functions.
For example, in the category of topological abelian groups, the image of a morphism actually corresponds to the inclusion of the &quot;closure&quot; of the range of the function.
For this reason, people will often distinguish the meanings of the two terms in this context, using &quot;image&quot; for the abstract categorical concept and &quot;range&quot; for the elementary set-theoretic concept.

In many common situations, such as the category of sets, where images and coimages exist, their objects are isomorphic.
Put more precisely, we have a factorisation of &quot;f&quot;: &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; as
:&quot;A&quot; → &quot;C&quot; → &quot;I&quot; → &quot;B&quot;,
where the morphism on the left is the coimage, the morphism on the right is the image, and the morphism in the middle (called the &quot;parallel&quot; of &quot;f&quot;) is an isomorphism.

In a pre-abelian category, &quot;this is not necessarily true&quot;.
The factorisation shown above does always exist, but the parallel might not be an isomorphism.
In fact, the parallel of &quot;f&quot; is an isomorphism for every morphism &quot;f&quot; if and only if the pre-abelian category is an abelian category.
An example of a non-abelian, pre-abelian category is, once again, the category of topological abelian groups.
As remarked, the image is the inclusion of the &quot;closure&quot; of the range; however, the coimage is a quotient map onto the range itself.
Thus, the parallel is the inclusion of the range into its closure, which is not an isomorphism unless the range was already closed.

== Exact functors ==

Recall that all finite limits and colimits exist in a pre-abelian category.
In general category theory, a functor is called &quot;left exact&quot; if it preserves all finite limits and &quot;right exact&quot; if it preserves all finite colimits. (A functor is simply &quot;exact&quot; if it&#x27;s both left exact and right exact.)

In a pre-abelian category, exact functors can be described in particularly simple terms.
First, recall that an additive functor is a functor &quot;F&quot;: C → D between preadditive categories that acts as a group homomorphism on each hom-set.
Then it turns out that a functor between pre-abelian categories is left exact if and only if it is additive and preserves all kernels, and it&#x27;s right exact if and only if it&#x27;s additive and preserves all cokernels.

Note that an exact functor, because it preserves both kernels and cokernels, preserves all images and coimages.
Exact functors are most useful in the study of abelian categories, where they can be applied to exact sequences.

== Maximal exact structure ==

On every pre-abelian category formula_1 there exists an exact structure formula_2 that is maximal in the sense that it contains every other exact structure. The exact structure formula_2 consists of precisely those kernel-cokernel pairs formula_4 where formula_5 is a semi-stable kernel and formula_6 is a semi-stable cokernel. Here, formula_7 is a semi-stable kernel if it is a kernel and for each morphism formula_8 in the pushout diagram

formula_9

the morphism formula_10 is again a kernel. formula_11 is a semi-stable cokernel if it is a cokernel and for every morphism formula_12 in the pullback diagram

formula_13

the morphism formula_14 is again a cokernel.

A pre-abelian category formula_1 is quasi-abelian if and only if all kernel-cokernel pairs form an exact structure. An example for which this is not the case is the category of (Hausdorff) bornological spaces.

The result is also valid for additive categories that are not pre-abelian but Karoubian.

== Special cases ==

* An &quot;abelian category&quot; is a pre-abelian category such that every monomorphism and epimorphism is normal.
* A &quot;quasi-abelian category&quot; is a pre-abelian category in which kernels are stable under pushouts and cokernels are stable under pullbacks.
* A &quot;semi-abelian category&quot; is a pre-abelian category in which for each morphism formula_5 the induced morphism formula_17 is always a monomorphism and an epimorphism.

The pre-abelian categories most commonly studied are in fact abelian categories; for example, Ab is an abelian category. Pre-abelian categories that are not abelian appear for instance in functional analysis.

<text>Henry Benedict Thomas Edward Maria Clement Francis Xavier Stuart, Cardinal Duke of York (6 March 1725 – 13 July 1807) was a Roman Catholic cardinal, and was the third and final Jacobite heir to publicly claim the thrones of Great Britain and Ireland, as the younger grandson of King James II of England. One of the longest-serving cardinals in history, Henry spent his whole life in the Papal States and became the Dean of the College of Cardinals and Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia and Velletri. Unlike his father James Francis Edward Stuart (&quot;The Old Pretender&quot;) and elder brother Charles Edward Stuart (&quot;The Young Pretender&quot; or &quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot;), Henry made no effort to seize the thrones. After Charles&#x27;s death in 1788, Henry became known by Jacobites as Henry IX and I, but the Papacy did not recognise Henry as the lawful ruler of Great Britain and Ireland and instead referred to him as the &quot;Cardinal Duke of York&quot;. He was most widely known as the &quot;Duke of York&quot;, a title in the Jacobite peerage granted to him by his father.

==Early life==
Henry was born in exile at the Palazzo Muti in Rome on 6 March 1725 and baptised on the same day by Pope Benedict XIII, 37 years after his grandfather James II and VII lost the thrones, and ten years after his father&#x27;s failed attempt to regain it. His father was James Francis Edward Stuart, known to his opponents as &quot;the Old Pretender&quot;. His mother was the Princess Maria Klementyna Sobieska, granddaughter of the Polish King and Lithuanian Grand-Duke, John III Sobieski. Henry was apparently an intelligent child who could spell and write better than his older brother Charles. More introverted than Charles and more cautious in his approach to problems, Henry was described as pious and mild-mannered.
Henry went to France in 1745 to help his brother, Prince Charles Edward Stuart (&quot;Bonnie Prince Charlie&quot;, or &quot;the Young Pretender&quot;) prepare the Jacobite rising of 1745. Attached to the French Royal Army, he was in nominal command of a cross-channel invasion force of some 10,000 men that never made it out of Dunkirk, and subsequently served under Maurice de Saxe at the siege of Antwerp. After the defeat at the Battle of Culloden (1746), Henry Stuart returned to Italy, aged 21.

==Ecclesiastical career==
On 30 June 1747 Pope Benedict XIV conferred the tonsure on him and created him Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria in Campitelli in a special consistory held on 3 July 1747. On 27 August 1747 he was promoted through the four minor orders by Benedict. He received the subdiaconate on 18 August 1748 and diaconate on 25 August 1748. His elder brother Charles, who was in France at the time, was not in favor of the ecclesiastical honors as he believed they would only serve to further religious prejudice against the Stuarts.

As the cardinalate was a rank rather than one of the priestly orders, Charles hoped that Henry might yet make a politically advantageous marriage, and was dismayed to discover that his brother had been ordained a priest on 1 September 1748. Later that month, Henry was made Cardinal-Priest, retaining his diaconal church. In 1751, he was made Arch-Priest of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica.

 Louis XV of France bestowed on the Cardinal the abbeys of Auchin and St. Amand as compensation for having had to evict his brother pursuant to the terms of the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.

In December 1752 his titular seat was changed to Santi Apostoli; and in 1758 the Pope named him Camerlengo of the Sacred College of Cardinals. The responsibilities of this office included administering all property, fees, funds and revenue belonging to the College of Cardinals, celebrating the requiem Mass for a deceased cardinal, and charge of the registry of the &quot;Acta Consistoralia&quot;. He participated in the 1758 papal conclave, which elected Pope Clement XIII. In October of that year, Henry was made titular Archbishop of Corinth. The following year, he resigned the title of Santa Maria in Campitelli to assume that of Santa Maria in Trastevere; however, he retained the Church of Santi Apostoli &quot;in commendam&quot;.

He was made Cardinal-Bishop of Frascati on 13 July 1761. He was appointed Dean of the Sacred College of Cardinals on 26 September 1803, then also succeeding to the See of Ostia and Velletri. He lived and worked in Frascati for many years, descending each afternoon in his carriage to Rome, where his position as vice-chancellor entitled him to the Palazzo della Cancelleria.

Henry was the last claimant to the British throne to touch the sick to cure them from the King&#x27;s Evil.

Henry is described as a beatific, abstemious, wealthy, celibate aesthete who lived to a great age, &#x27;inoffensive and respectable&#x27; to the end.

==French Revolution and later life==

At the time of the French Revolution, he lost his French Royal benefices and sacrificed many other resources to assist Pope Pius VI. This, in addition to the seizure of his Frascati property by the French, caused him to descend into poverty, which resulted in the sale of the Stuart Sapphire. The British Minister in Venice arranged for Henry to receive an annuity of £4,000 from George III of Great Britain. Although the British government represented this as an act of charity, Henry and the Jacobites considered it to be a first instalment on the money which was legally owed to him. (For many years the British government had promised to return the English dowry of his grandmother, Mary of Modena, but never did so.)

The Vatican had recognised James Francis Edward Stuart as James III and VIII as the King of Great Britain and Ireland. After his death in 1766, the Vatican did not recognise his son (Henry&#x27;s brother) Charles, who had converted to Anglicanism in 1750. The Vatican had not, however, overtly recognised the Hanoverian monarchs. However, in November 1792 the Vatican first referred to George III as the King of Great Britain and Ireland instead of the Elector of Hanover. This resulted in a protest by Henry, who suggested the insult would result in him not visiting Rome again.

Despite their general anti-clericalism and hostility to the Bourbon monarchy, the French Directory suggested to the United Irishmen in 1798 to elevate Henry as King of the Irish (Henry IX). This was in the course of General Jean Joseph Amable Humbert landing a force in County Mayo for the Irish Rebellion of 1798, and trying to rally the Catholic population: a significant number of Irish priests supported the Rising, even though Humbert&#x27;s army had been veterans of the anti-clerical campaign in Italy. The French hoped Henry could lead a French client state in Ireland; however, Wolfe Tone, the Protestant republican leader, vetoed the scheme.
Henry returned to Frascati in 1803. In September of that year he became the Dean of the College of Cardinals and hence Cardinal Bishop of Ostia and Velletri, though he still lived in the episcopal palace at Frascati. He died there on 13 July 1807, aged 82, simultaneously the 60th anniversary of his appointment as the Cardinal Deacon of his titular church, and the 46th anniversary of his elevation to the rank of Cardinal Bishop.

==Personal life==

Some modern historians have speculated whether Henry was homosexual. Contemporary accounts include the writings of Hester Lynch Thrale (1741–1821), and the diplomat and writer (1740–1819). Gorani admitted to having gathered evidence insufficient to confirm his suspicions either way, but drew attention to the number of handsome clerics that were to be found in Henry&#x27;s palace. The historian Andrew Lang alluded to James&#x27;s comment that his younger son would never marry although many marriages had been planned for him.

The writer Gaetano Moroni provides the lengthiest account of Henry&#x27;s close attachment with his majordomo (1722–1802), whom Henry was said to have &quot;loved beyond measure&quot;. This led to serious tensions between the cardinal and his father James, who in 1752 tried to have Lercari dismissed from Rome. Henry reacted by attempting to secure his financial independence, and refused to return to Rome from Bologna without Lercari by his side. A public scandal was narrowly avoided by the intervention of Pope Benedict XIV. It was agreed that Lercari would leave the household, and he was later made Archbishop of Genoa.

Things became easier after the death of James in 1766. From 1769 onwards Henry remained close to Angelo Cesarini, a nobleman from Perugia, who under Henry&#x27;s protection won various honours, was made canon of the cathedral in Frascati, and in 1801 became Bishop of Milevi. Henry died with Cesarini at his side, as for the past 32 years. Cesarini was later buried in the church of Santa Maria in Vallicella.

These relationships may have had a romantic element.

==Legacy==

Under his will, which he signed as &quot;Henry R&quot; (i.e. Rex or king), he was succeeded in all his claimed British rights by his nearest blood-relative and friend, King Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia. Like his successors, Charles Emmanuel neither asserted nor renounced his Jacobite claims.

In his will he left the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom to the Prince of Wales, the future George IV.

Henry, his brother, his father and his mother are buried in the crypt of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in the Vatican. There is a monument to the Royal Stuarts on one of the columns in the basilica proper, designed by Antonio Canova. The monument was originally commissioned by Angelo Cesarini, executor of Henry Benedict&#x27;s estate. Among the subscribers was George IV.

The monument was restored at the expense of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in the 1940s.

<text>Austrasia was the northeastern kingdom within the core of the Frankish Empire during the Early Middle Ages, centring on the Meuse, Middle Rhine and the Moselle rivers. It included the original Frankish-ruled territories within what had been the northernmost part of Roman Gaul, and cities such as Cologne, Trier and Metz. It also stretched beyond the old Roman borders on the Rhine into Frankish areas which had never been formally under Roman rule. It came into being as a part of the Frankish Empire founded by Clovis I (481–511). At the same time, the initial powerbase of Clovis himself was the more Romanized part of northern Gaul, lying southwest of Austrasia, which came to be known as Neustria. 

These two sub-kingdoms, along with several others, were subsequently ruled by the descendants of Clovis, the Merovingian dynasty, followed in the 8th and 9th centuries by their successors the Carolingian dynasty, whose own powerbase was in Austrasia itself. The two Frankish dynasties did not always have a single ruler ruling the whole Frankish empire. They also often allowed different family members to rule sub-kingdoms, and these were sometimes even in conflict with each other despite the underlying continuity of the overall Frankish empire. Already by 561, Austrasia was ruled as a separate kingdom within the Frankish realm by the Merovingian king Sigebert I (561–575). 

The last emperor to hold the entire Frankish empire including Austrasia was Louis the Pious. For several generations his descendants negotiated different ways of dividing the empire. In 880, the Treaty of Ribemont was the last such major agreement, which established formal boundaries eastern, central, and western sub-kingdoms that remained important throughout the Middle Ages. West Francia, which contained Neustria, was the basis of the later medieval Kingdom of France. Lotharingia, which corresponded to Austrasia, was folded into the larger kingdom of East Francia. These became the core of the Holy Roman Empire, which also had claims over the kingdoms of Burgundy, and Italy.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Austrasia&quot; is not well attested in the Merovingian period. The first surviving record of the term is by Gregory of Tours, writing in about 580. It was later used by Aimoin of Fleury around 1000. It is presumably the latinization of an Old Frankish name, reconstructed as &quot;*Oster-rike&quot; (&quot;Eastern Kingdom&quot;).
As with the name &quot;Austria&quot;, it contains the word for &quot;east&quot;, and means &quot;eastern land&quot;. The term designated the original territory of the Franks in contrast to Neustria, which apparently meant the &quot;(new) western land&quot;.

==Geography==
Austrasia was centered on the Middle Rhine, including the basins of the Moselle, Main and Meuse rivers. It bordered on Frisia and Saxony to the north, Thuringia to the east, Swabia and Burgundy to the south and to Neustria to the southwest. The exact boundary between Merovingian Neustria and Austrasia is unclear with respect to areas such as the medieval counties of Flanders, Brabant and Hainaut, and areas immediately to the south of these.

Metz served as the Austrasian capital, although some Austrasian kings ruled from Reims, Trier and Cologne. Other important cities included Verdun, Worms and Speyer. Fulda monastery, an important royal monastery, was founded in eastern Austrasia in the final decade of the Merovingian period.

In the High Middle Ages, its territory became divided among the duchies of Lotharingia and Franconia in Germany, with some western portions including Reims and Rethel passing to France.

Its exact boundaries were somewhat fluid over the history of the Frankish sub-kingdoms, but Austrasia can be taken to correspond roughly to the territory of present-day Luxembourg, parts of eastern Belgium, north-eastern France (Lorraine and Champagne-Ardenne), west-central Germany (the Rhineland, Hesse and Franconia) and the southern Netherlands (Limburg, North Brabant, with a salient north of the Rhine including Utrecht and parts of Gelderland).

== History ==
After the death of the Frankish king Clovis I in 511, his four sons partitioned his kingdom amongst themselves, with Theuderic I receiving the lands that were to become Austrasia. Descended from Theuderic, a line of kings ruled Austrasia until 555, when it was united with the other Frankish kingdoms of Chlothar I, who inherited all the Frankish realms by 558. He redivided the Frankish territory amongst his four sons, but the four kingdoms coalesced into three on the death of Charibert I in 567: Austrasia under Sigebert I, Neustria under Chilperic I, and Burgundy under Guntram. These three kingdoms defined the political division of Francia until the rise of the Carolingians and even thereafter.

From 567 to the death of Sigebert II in 613, Neustria and Austrasia fought each other almost constantly, with Burgundy playing the peacemaker between them. These struggles reached their climax in the wars between Brunhilda and Fredegund, queens, respectively, of Austrasia and Neustria. Finally, in 613, a rebellion by the nobility against Brunhilda saw her betrayed and handed over to her nephew and foe in Neustria, Chlothar II. Chlothar then took control of the other two kingdoms and set up a united Frankish kingdom with its capital in Paris. During this period the first &quot;majores domus&quot; or mayors of the palace appeared. These officials acted as mediators between the king and the people in each realm. The first Austrasian mayors came from the Pippinid family, which experienced a slow but steady ascent until it eventually displaced the Merovingians on the throne.
In 623, the Austrasians asked Chlothar II for a king of their own and he appointed his son Dagobert I to rule over them with Pepin of Landen as regent. Dagobert&#x27;s government in Austrasia was widely admired. In 629, he inherited Neustria and Burgundy. Austrasia was again neglected until, in 633, the people demanded the king&#x27;s son as their own king again. Dagobert complied and sent his elder son Sigebert III to Austrasia. Historians often categorise Sigebert as the first &quot;roi fainéant&quot;, or do-nothing king, of the Merovingian dynasty. His court was dominated by the mayors. In 657, the mayor Grimoald the Elder succeeded in putting his son Childebert the Adopted on the throne, where he remained until 662. Thereafter, Austrasia was predominantly the kingdom of the Arnulfing mayors of the palace and their base of power. With the Battle of Tertry in 687, Pepin of Heristal defeated the Neustrian king Theuderic III and established his mayoralty over all the Frankish kingdoms. This was even regarded by contemporaries as the beginning of his &quot;reign&quot;. It also signalled the dominance of Austrasia over Neustria, which would last until the end of the Merovingian era.

In 718, Charles Martel had Austrasian support in his war against Neustria for control of all the Francian realms. He was not king himself, but appointed Chlothar IV to rule in Austrasia. In 719, Francia was united by Martel&#x27;s family, the Carolingian dynasty, under Austrasian hegemony. While the Frankish kings continued to divide up the Frankish realm in different ways over subsequent generations, the term Austrasia was only used occasionally after the Carolingian dynasty.

<doc id="62781" wikidata="Q4370335" url="?curid=62781" title="Complete category">
<text>In mathematics, a complete category is a category in which all small limits exist. That is, a category &quot;C&quot; is complete if every diagram &quot;F&quot; : &quot;J&quot; → &quot;C&quot; (where &quot;J&quot; is small) has a limit in &quot;C&quot;. Dually, a cocomplete category is one in which all small colimits exist. A bicomplete category is a category which is both complete and cocomplete.

The existence of &quot;all&quot; limits (even when &quot;J&quot; is a proper class) is too strong to be practically relevant. Any category with this property is necessarily a thin category: for any two objects there can be at most one morphism from one object to the other.

A weaker form of completeness is that of finite completeness. A category is finitely complete if all finite limits exists (i.e. limits of diagrams indexed by a finite category &quot;J&quot;). Dually, a category is finitely cocomplete if all finite colimits exist.

==Theorems==

It follows from the existence theorem for limits that a category is complete if and only if it has equalizers (of all pairs of morphisms) and all (small) products. Since equalizers may be constructed from pullbacks and binary products (consider the pullback of (&quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot;) along the diagonal Δ), a category is complete if and only if it has pullbacks and products.

Dually, a category is cocomplete if and only if it has coequalizers and all (small) coproducts, or, equivalently, pushouts and coproducts.

Finite completeness can be characterized in several ways. For a category &quot;C&quot;, the following are all equivalent:
*&quot;C&quot; is finitely complete,
*&quot;C&quot; has equalizers and all finite products,
*&quot;C&quot; has equalizers, binary products, and a terminal object,
*&quot;C&quot; has pullbacks and a terminal object.
The dual statements are also equivalent.

A small category &quot;C&quot; is complete if and only if it is cocomplete. A small complete category is necessarily thin.

A posetal category vacuously has all equalizers and coequalizers, whence it is (finitely) complete if and only if it has all (finite) products, and dually for cocompleteness. Without the finiteness restriction a posetal category with all products is automatically cocomplete, and dually, by a theorem about complete lattices.

==Examples and nonexamples==
*The following categories are bicomplete:
**Set, the category of sets
**Top, the category of topological spaces
**Grp, the category of groups
**Ab, the category of abelian groups
**Ring, the category of rings
**&quot;K&quot;-Vect, the category of vector spaces over a field &quot;K&quot;
**&quot;R&quot;-Mod, the category of modules over a commutative ring &quot;R&quot;
**CmptH, the category of all compact Hausdorff spaces
**Cat, the category of all small categories
**Whl, the category of wheels
**sSet, the category of simplicial sets
*The following categories are finitely complete and finitely cocomplete but neither complete nor cocomplete:
**The category of finite sets
**The category of finite abelian groups
**The category of finite-dimensional vector spaces
*Any (pre)abelian category is finitely complete and finitely cocomplete.
*The category of complete lattices is complete but not cocomplete.
*The category of metric spaces, Met, is finitely complete but has neither binary coproducts nor infinite products.
*The category of fields, Field, is neither finitely complete nor finitely cocomplete.
*A poset, considered as a small category, is complete (and cocomplete) if and only if it is a complete lattice.
*The partially ordered class of all ordinal numbers is cocomplete but not complete (since it has no terminal object).
*A group, considered as a category with a single object, is complete if and only if it is trivial. A nontrivial group has pullbacks and pushouts, but not products, coproducts, equalizers, coequalizers, terminal objects, or initial objects.

<doc id="62784" wikidata="Q11006" url="?curid=62784" title="Soybean">
<text>The soybean, soy bean, or soya bean (Glycine max) is a species of legume native to East Asia, widely grown for its edible bean, which has numerous uses.

Traditional unfermented food uses of soybeans include soy milk, from which tofu and tofu skin are made. Fermented soy foods include soy sauce, fermented bean paste, nattō, and tempeh. Fat-free (defatted) soybean meal is a significant and cheap source of protein for animal feeds and many packaged meals. For example, soybean products, such as textured vegetable protein (TVP), are ingredients in many meat and dairy substitutes.

Soybeans contain significant amounts of phytic acid, dietary minerals and B vitamins. Soy vegetable oil, used in food and industrial applications, is another product of processing the soybean crop. Soybean is a common protein source in feed for farm animals that in turn yield animal protein for human consumption.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;soy&quot; derives from the Japanese &quot;soi&quot;, a regional variant of &quot;shōyu&quot;, meaning &quot;soy sauce&quot;.

The name of the genus, &quot;Glycine&quot;, comes from Linnaeus. When naming the genus, Linnaeus observed that one of the species formerly within the genus, which is later reclassified to the genus Apios, had a sweet root. Based on the sweetness, the Greek word for sweet, &quot;glykós&quot;, was Latinized. The genus name is not related to the amino acid glycine.

==Description==
Like most plants, soybeans grow in distinct morphological stages as they develop from seeds into fully mature plants.

===Germination===
The first stage of growth is germination, a method which first becomes apparent as a seed&#x27;s radicle emerges. This is the first stage of root growth and occurs within the first 48 hours under ideal growing conditions. The first photosynthetic structures, the cotyledons, develop from the hypocotyl, the first plant structure to emerge from the soil. These cotyledons both act as leaves and as a source of nutrients for the immature plant, providing the seedling nutrition for its first 7 to 10 days.

===Maturation===
The first true leaves develop as a pair of single blades. Subsequent to this first pair, mature nodes form compound leaves with three blades. Mature trifoliolate leaves, having three to four leaflets per leaf, are often between long and broad. Under ideal conditions, stem growth continues, producing new nodes every four days. Before flowering, roots can grow per day. If rhizobia are present, root nodulation begins by the time the third node appears. Nodulation typically continues for 8 weeks before the symbiotic infection process stabilizes. The final characteristics of a soybean plant are variable, with factors such as genetics, soil quality, and climate affecting its form; however, fully mature soybean plants are generally between in height and have rooting depths between .

===Flowering===
Flowering is triggered by day length, often beginning once days become shorter than 12.8 hours. This trait is highly variable however, with different varieties reacting differently to changing day length. Soybeans form inconspicuous, self-fertile flowers which are borne in the axil of the leaf and are white, pink or purple. Though they do not require pollination, they are attractive to bees, because they produce nectar that is high in sugar content. Depending on the soybean variety, node growth may cease once flowering begins. Strains that continue nodal development after flowering are termed &quot;indeterminates&quot; and are best suited to climates with longer growing seasons. Often soybeans drop their leaves before the seeds are fully mature.

The fruit is a hairy pod that grows in clusters of three to five, each pod is long and usually contains two to four (rarely more) seeds 5–11 mm in diameter. Soybean seeds come in a wide variety of sizes and hull colors such as black, brown, yellow, and green. Variegated and bicolored seed coats are also common.

===Seed resilience===
The hull of the mature bean is hard, water-resistant, and protects the cotyledon and hypocotyl (or &quot;germ&quot;) from damage. If the seed coat is cracked, the seed will not germinate. The scar, visible on the seed coat, is called the hilum (colors include black, brown, buff, gray and yellow) and at one end of the hilum is the micropyle, or small opening in the seed coat which can allow the absorption of water for sprouting.

Some seeds such as soybeans containing very high levels of protein can undergo desiccation, yet survive and revive after water absorption. A. Carl Leopold began studying this capability at the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research at Cornell University in the mid-1980s. He found soybeans and corn to have a range of soluble carbohydrates protecting the seed&#x27;s cell viability. Patents were awarded to him in the early 1990s on techniques for protecting biological membranes and proteins in the dry state.

=== Chemistry ===
Dry soybeans contain 36% protein and 20% fat in form of soybean oil by weight. The remainder consists of 30% carbohydrates, 9% water and 5% ash. 
Soybeans comprise approximately 8% seed coat or hull, 90% cotyledons and 2% hypocotyl axis or germ.

== Taxonomy ==
The genus &quot;Glycine&quot; may be divided into two subgenera, &quot;Glycine&quot; and &quot;Soja&quot;. The subgenus &quot;Soja&quot; includes the cultivated soybean, &quot;G. max&quot;, and the wild soybean, treated either as a separate species &quot;G. soja&quot;, or as the subspecies &quot;G. max&quot; subsp. &quot;soja&quot;. The cultivated and wild soybeans are annuals. The wild soybean is native to China, Japan, Korea and Russia. The subgenus &quot;Glycine&quot; consists of at least 25 wild perennial species: for example, &quot;G. canescens&quot; and &quot;G. tomentella&quot;, both found in Australia and Papua New Guinea. Perennial soybean (&quot;Neonotonia wightii&quot;) belongs to a different genus. It originated in Africa and is now a widespread pasture crop in the tropics.

Like some other crops of long domestication, the relationship of the modern soybean to wild-growing species can no longer be traced with any degree of certainty. It is a cultigen with a very large number of cultivars.

== Ecology ==
Like many legumes, soybeans can fix atmospheric nitrogen, due to the presence of symbiotic bacteria from the Rhizobia group.

== Cultivation ==


===Conditions===
Cultivation is successful in climates with hot summers, with optimum growing conditions in mean temperatures of ; temperatures of below and over stunt growth significantly. They can grow in a wide range of soils, with optimum growth in moist alluvial soils with good organic content. Soybeans, like most legumes, perform nitrogen fixation by establishing a symbiotic relationship with the bacterium &quot;Bradyrhizobium japonicum&quot; (syn. &quot;Rhizobium japonicum&quot;; Jordan 1982). This ability to fix nitrogen allows farmers to reduce nitrogen fertilizer use and increase yields when growing other crops in rotation with soy. There may be some trade-offs, however, in the long-term abundance of organic material in soils where soy and other crops (for example, corn) are grown in rotation. For best results, though, an inoculum of the correct strain of bacteria should be mixed with the soybean (or any legume) seed before planting. Modern crop cultivars generally reach a height of around , and take 80–120 days from sowing to harvesting.

===Soils===
Soil scientists Edson Lobato (Brazil), Andrew McClung (U.S.), and Alysson Paolinelli (Brazil) were awarded the 2006 World Food Prize for transforming the ecologically biodiverse savannah of the Cerrado region of Brazil into highly productive cropland that could grow profitable soybeans.
===Contamination concerns===
Human sewage sludge can be used as fertilizer to grow soybeans. Soybeans grown in sewage sludge likely contain elevated concentrations of metals.

===Pests===

Soybean plants are vulnerable to a wide range of bacterial diseases, fungal diseases, viral diseases, and parasites.

The primary bacterial diseases include bacterial blight, bacterial pustule and downy mildew affecting the soybean plant.

The Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica) poses a significant threat to agricultural crops, including soybeans, due to its voracious feeding habits. Found commonly in both urban and suburban areas, these beetles are frequently observed in agricultural landscapes where they can cause considerable damage to crops like corn, soybeans, and various fruits.

Soybean cyst nematode (SCN) is the worst pest of soybean in the US. Losses of 30% or 40% are common even without symptoms.

The corn earworm moth and bollworm (Helicoverpa zea) is a common and destructive pest of soybean growth in Virginia.

Soybeans are consumed by whitetail deer which may damage soybean plants through feeding, trampling and bedding, reducing crop yields by as much as 15%. Groundhogs are also a common pest in soybean fields, living in burrows underground and feeding nearby. One den of groundhogs can consume a tenth to a quarter of an acre of soybeans. Chemical repellents or firearms are effective for controlling pests in soybean fields.
Soybeans suffer from the fungus &quot;Pythium spinosum&quot; in Arkansas and Indiana (United States), and China.

In Japan and the United States, the Soybean dwarf virus (SbDV) causes a disease in soybeans and is transmitted by aphids.

===Cultivars===
====Disease resistant cultivars====
Resistant varieties are available. In Indian cultivars, Nataraj &quot;et al.&quot; 2020 find that anthracnose caused by &quot;Colletotrichum truncatum&quot; is resisted by a combination of 2 major genes.

=====PI 88788=====
The vast majority of cultivars in the US have soybean cyst nematode resistance (SCN resistance), but rely on only one breeding line (PI 88788) as their sole source of resistance. (The resistance genes provided by PI 88788, , and were characterized in 1997.) As a result, for example, in 2012 only 18 cultivars out of 807 recommended by the Iowa State University Extension had any ancestry outside of PI 88788. By 2020 the situation was still about the same: Of 849 there were 810 with some ancestry from PI 88788, 35 from Peking, and only 2 from PI 89772. (On the question of exclusively PI 88788 ancestry, that number was not available for 2020.) That was speculated to be in 2012—and was clearly by 2020—producing SCN populations that are virulent on PI 88788.

=== Production ===


In 2020, world production of soybeans was over 353 million tonnes, led by Brazil and the United States combined with 66% of the total (table). Production has dramatically increased across the globe since the 1960s, but particularly in South America after a cultivar that grew well in low latitudes was developed in the 1980s. The rapid growth of the industry has been primarily fueled by large increases in worldwide demand for meat products, particularly in developing countries like China, which alone accounts for more than 60% of imports.

==== Environmental issues ====

In spite of the Amazon &quot;Soy Moratorium&quot;, soy production continues to play a significant role in deforestation when its indirect impacts are taken into account, as land used to grow soy continues to increase. This land either comes from pasture land (which increasingly supplants forested areas), or areas outside the Amazon not covered by the moratorium, such as the Cerrado region. Roughly one-fifth of deforestation can be attributed to expanding land use to produce oilseeds, primarily for soy and palm oil, whereas the expansion of beef production accounts for 41%. The main driver of deforestation is the global demand for meat, which in turn requires huge tracts of land to grow feed crops for livestock. Around 80% of the global soybean crop is used to feed livestock.

== History ==

Soybeans were a crucial crop in East Asia long before written records began. The origin of soy bean cultivation remains scientifically debated. The closest living relative of the soybean is &quot;Glycine soja&quot; (previously called &quot;G. ussuriensis&quot;), a legume native to central China. There is evidence for soybean domestication between 7000 and 6600 BC in China, between 5000 and 3000 BC in Japan and 1000 BC in Korea.

The first unambiguously domesticated, cultigen-sized soybean was discovered in Korea at the Mumun-period Daundong site. Prior to fermented products such as fermented black soybeans (&quot;douchi&quot;), &quot;jiang&quot; (Chinese miso), soy sauce, tempeh, nattō, and miso, soy was considered sacred for its beneficial effects in crop rotation, and it was eaten by itself, and as bean curd and soy milk.

Soybeans were introduced to Java in Malay Archipelago circa 13th century or probably earlier. By the 17th century through their trade with Far East, soybeans and its products were traded by European traders (Portuguese, Spanish, and Dutch) in Asia, and reached Indian Subcontinent by this period. By the 18th century, soybeans were introduced to the Americas and Europe from China. Soy was introduced to Africa from China in the late 19th century, and is now widespread across the continent.

===East Asia===
The cultivation of soybeans began in the eastern half of northern China by 2000 BC, but is almost certainly much older. The earliest documented evidence for the use of &quot;Glycine&quot; of any kind comes from charred plant remains of wild soybean recovered from Jiahu in Henan province China, a Neolithic site occupied between 9000 and 7800 calendar years ago (cal bp). An abundance of archeological charred soybean specimens have been found centered around this region.

According to the ancient Chinese myth, in 2853 BC, the legendary Emperor Shennong of China proclaimed that five plants were sacred: soybeans, rice, wheat, barley, and millet. Early Chinese records mention that soybeans were a gift from the region of Yangtze River delta and Southeast China. The &quot;Great Soviet Encyclopedia&quot; claims soybean cultivation originated in China about 5000 years ago. Some scholars suggest that soybean originated in China and was domesticated about 3500 BC. Recent research, however, indicates that seeding of wild forms started early (before 5000 BC) in multiple locations throughout East Asia.

Soybeans became an important crop by the Zhou dynasty (c. 1046–256 BC) in China. However, the details of where, when, and under what circumstances soybean developed a close relationship with people are poorly understood. Soybean was unknown in South China before the Han period. From about the first century AD to the Age of Discovery (15–16th centuries), soybeans were introduced into across South and Southeast Asia. This spread was due to the establishment of sea and land trade routes. The earliest Japanese textual reference to the soybean is in the classic &quot;Kojiki&quot; (&quot;Records of Ancient Matters&quot;), which was completed in AD 712.

The oldest preserved soybeans resembling modern varieties in size and shape were found in archaeological sites in Korea dated about 1000 BC. Radiocarbon dating of soybean samples recovered through flotation during excavations at the Early Mumun period Okbang site in Korea indicated soybean was cultivated as a food crop in around 1000–900 BC. Soybeans from the Jōmon period in Japan from 3000 BC are also significantly larger than wild varieties.

===Southeast Asia===
Soybeans were mentioned as &quot;kadêlê&quot; (modern Indonesian term: ) in an old Javanese manuscript, Serat Sri Tanjung, which dates to 12th- to 13th-century Java. By the 13th century, the soybean had arrived and cultivated in Indonesia; it probably arrived much earlier however, carried by traders or merchants from Southern China.

The earliest known reference to it as &quot;tempeh&quot; appeared in 1815 in the Serat Centhini manuscript. The development of tempeh fermented soybean cake probably took place earlier, circa 17th century in Java.

===Indian subcontinent===
By the 1600s, soy sauce spread from southern Japan across the region through the Dutch East India Company (VOC).

While the origins and history of Soybean cultivation in the Eastern Himalayas is debated, it was potentially introduced from southern China, more specifically Yunnan province. Alternatively, it could have reached here through traders from Indonesia via Myanmar. Northeast India is viewed as a passive micro-centre within the soybean secondary gene centre. Central India is considered a tertiary gene centre particularly the area encompassing Madhya Pradesh which is also the country largest soybean producer.

===Iberia===
In 1603, &quot;Vocabvlario da Lingoa de Iapam&quot;, a famous Japanese-Portuguese dictionary, was compiled and published by Jesuit priests in Nagasaki. It contains short but clear definitions for about 20 words related to soyfoods—the first in any European language.

The Luso-Hispanic traders were familiar with soybeans and soybean product through their trade with Far East since at least the 17th century. However, it was not until the late 19th century that the first attempt to cultivate soybeans in the Iberian peninsula was undertaken. In 1880, the soybean was first cultivated in Portugal in the Botanical Gardens at Coimbra (Crespi 1935).

In about 1910 in Spain the first attempts at Soybean cultivation were made by the Count of San Bernardo, who cultivated soybeans on his estates at Almillo (in southwest Spain) about 48 miles east-northeast of Seville.

===North America===
Soybeans were first introduced to North America from China in 1765, by Samuel Bowen, a former East India Company sailor who had visited China in conjunction with James Flint, the first Englishman legally permitted by the Chinese authorities to learn Chinese. The first &quot;New World&quot; soybean crop was grown on Skidaway Island, Georgia, in 1765 by Henry Yonge from seeds given him by Samuel Bowen. Bowen grew soy near Savannah, Georgia, possibly using funds from Flint, and made soy sauce for sale to England. Although soybean was introduced into North America in 1765, for the next 155 years, the crop was grown primarily for forage.

In 1831, the first soy product &quot;a few dozen India Soy&quot; [sauce] arrived in Canada. Soybeans were probably first cultivated in Canada by 1855, and definitely in 1895 at Ontario Agricultural College.

It was not until Lafayette Mendel and Thomas Burr Osborne showed that the nutritional value of soybean seeds could be increased by cooking, moisture or heat, that soy went from a farm animal feed to a human food.

William Morse is considered the &quot;father&quot; of modern soybean agriculture in America. In 1910, he and Charles Piper began to popularize what was regarded as a relatively unknown Oriental peasant crop in America into a &quot;golden bean&quot;, with the soybean becoming one of America&#x27;s largest and most nutritious farm crops.

Prior to the 1920s in the US, the soybean was mainly a forage crop, a source of oil, meal (for feed) and industrial products, with very little used as food. However, it took on an important role after World War I. During the Great Depression, the drought-stricken (Dust Bowl) regions of the United States were able to use soy to regenerate their soil because of its nitrogen-fixing properties. Farms were increasing production to meet with government demands, and Henry Ford became a promoter of soybeans. In 1931, Ford hired chemists Robert Boyer and Frank Calvert to produce artificial silk. They succeeded in making a textile fiber of spun soy protein fibers, hardened or tanned in a formaldehyde bath, which was given the name Azlon. It never reached the commercial market. Soybean oil was used by Ford in paint for the automobiles, as well as a fluid for shock absorbers.

During World War II, soybeans became important in both North America and Europe chiefly as substitutes for other protein foods and as a source of edible oil. During the war, the soybean was discovered as fertilizer due to nitrogen fixation by the United States Department of Agriculture.

Prior to the 1970s, Asian-Americans and Seventh-Day Adventists were essentially the only users of soy foods in the United States. &quot;The soy foods movement began in small pockets of the counterculture, notably the Tennessee commune named simply The Farm, but by the mid-1970s a vegetarian revival helped it gain momentum and even popular awareness through books such as &quot;The Book of Tofu&quot;.&quot;

Although practically unseen in 1900, by 2000 soybean plantings covered more than 70 million acres, second only to corn, and it became America&#x27;s largest cash crop. In 2021, 87,195,000 acres were planted, with the largest acreage in the states of Illinois, Iowa, and Minnesota.

===Caribbean and West Indies===
The soybean arrived in the Caribbean in the form of soy sauce made by Samuel Bowen in Savannah, Georgia, in 1767. It remains only a minor crop there, but its uses for human food are growing steadily.

===Mediterranean area===
The soybean was first cultivated in Italy by 1760 in the Botanical Garden of Turin. During the 1780s, it was grown in at least three other botanical gardens in Italy. The first soybean product, soy oil, arrived in Anatolia during 1909 under Ottoman Empire. The first clear cultivation occurred in 1931. This was also the first time that soybeans were cultivated in Middle East. By 1939, soybeans were cultivated in Greece.

===Australia===
Wild soybeans were discovered in northeastern Australia in 1770 by explorers Banks and Solander. In 1804, the first soyfood product (&quot;Fine India Soy&quot; [sauce]) was sold in Sydney. In 1879, the first domesticated soybeans arrived in Australia, a gift of the Minister of the Interior Department, Japan.

===France===
The soybean was first cultivated in France by 1779 (and perhaps as early as 1740). The two key early people and organizations introducing the soybean to France were the Society of Acclimatization (starting in 1855) and Li Yu-ying (from 1910). Li started a large tofu factory, where the first commercial soyfoods in France were made.

===Africa===
The soybean first arrived in Africa via Egypt in 1857. Soya Meme (Baked Soya) is produced in the village called Bame Awudome near Ho, the capital of the Volta Region of Ghana, by the Ewe people of Southeastern Ghana and southern Togo.

===Central Europe===
In 1873, Professor Friedrich J. Haberlandt first became interested in soybeans when he obtained the seeds of 19 soybean varieties at the Vienna World Exposition (Wiener Weltausstellung). He cultivated these seeds in Vienna, and soon began to distribute them throughout Central and Western Europe. In 1875, he first grew the soybeans in Vienna, then in early 1876 he sent samples of seeds to seven cooperators in central Europe, who planted and tested the seeds in the spring of 1876, with good or fairly good results in each case. Most of the farmers who received seeds from him cultivated them, then reported their results. Starting in February 1876, he published these results first in various journal articles, and finally in his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, Die Sojabohne (The Soybean) in 1878. In northern Europe, lupin (lupine) is known as the &quot;soybean of the north&quot;.

===Central Asia===
The soybean is first in cultivated Transcaucasia in Central Asia in 1876, by the Dungans. This region has never been important for soybean production.

===Central America===
The first reliable reference to the soybean in this region dates from Mexico in 1877.

===South America===
The soybean first arrived in South America in Argentina in 1882.

Andrew McClung showed in the early 1950s that with soil amendments the Cerrado region of Brazil would grow soybeans. In June 1973, when soybean futures markets mistakenly portended a major shortage, the Nixon administration imposed an embargo on soybean exports. It lasted only a week, but Japanese buyers felt that they could not rely on U.S. supplies, and the rival Brazilian soybean industry came into existence. This led Brazil to become the world&#x27;s largest producer of soybeans in 2020, with 131 million tons.

Industrial soy production in South America is characterized by wealthy management who live far away from the production site which they manage remotely. In Brazil, these managers depend heavily on advanced technology and machinery, and agronomic practices such as zero tillage, high pesticide use, and intense fertilization. One contributing factor is the increased attention on the Brazilian Cerrado in Bahia, Brazil by US farmers in the early 2000s. This was due to rising values of scarce farmland and high production costs in the US Midwest. There were many promotions of the Brazilian Cerrado by US farm producer magazines and market consultants who portrayed it as having cheap land with ideal production conditions, with infrastructure being the only thing it was lacking. These same magazines also presented Brazilian soy as inevitably out-competing American soy. Another draw to investing was the insider information about the climate and market in Brazil. A few dozen American farmers purchased varying amounts of land by a variety of means including finding investors and selling off land holdings. Many followed the ethanol company model and formed an LLC with investments from neighboring farmers, friends, and family while some turned to investment companies. Some soy farmers either liquidated their Brazilian assets or switched to remote management from the US to return to farming there and implement new farming and business practices to make their US farms more productive. Others planned to sell their now expensive Bahia land to buy land cheaper land in the frontier regions of Piauí or Tocantins to create more soybean farms.

==Genetics==

Chinese landraces were found to have a slightly higher genetic diversity than inbred lines by Li &quot;et al.&quot;, 2010. Specific locus amplified fragment sequencing (SLAF-seq) has been used by Han &quot;et al.&quot;, 2015 to study the genetic history of the domestication process, perform genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of agronomically relevant traits, and produce high-density linkage maps. An SNP array was developed by Song &quot;et al.&quot;, 2013 and has been used for research and breeding; the same team applied their array in Song &quot;et al.&quot;, 2015 against the USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection and obtained mapping data that are expected to yield association mapping data for such traits.

 is a resistance gene against soybean rust. Rpp1-R1 is an R gene (NB-LRR) providing resistance against the rust pathogen &quot;Phakopsora pachyrhizi&quot;. Its synthesis product includes a ULP1 protease.

Qijian &quot;et al.&quot;, 2017 provides the gene array.

===Genetic modification===
Soybeans are one of the &quot;biotech food&quot; crops that have been genetically modified, and genetically modified soybeans are being used in an increasing number of products. In 1995, Monsanto company introduced glyphosate-tolerant soybeans that have been genetically modified to be resistant to Monsanto&#x27;s glyphosate herbicides through substitution of the &quot;Agrobacterium sp.&quot; (strain CP4) gene EPSP (5-enolpyruvyl shikimic acid-3-phosphate) synthase. The substituted version is not sensitive to glyphosate.

In 1997, about 8% of all soybeans cultivated for the commercial market in the United States were genetically modified. In 2010, the figure was 93%. As with other glyphosate-tolerant crops, concern is expressed over damage to biodiversity. A 2003 study concluded the &quot;Roundup Ready&quot; (RR) gene had been bred into so many different soybean cultivars, there had been little decline in genetic diversity, but &quot;diversity was limited among elite lines from some companies&quot;.

The widespread use of such types of GM soybeans in the Americas has caused problems with exports to some regions. GM crops require extensive certification before they can be legally imported into the European Union, where there is considerable supplier and consumer reluctance to use GM products for consumer or animal use. Difficulties with coexistence and subsequent traces of cross-contamination of non-GM stocks have caused shipments to be rejected and have put a premium on non-GM soy.

A 2006 United States Department of Agriculture report found the adoption of genetically engineered (GE) soy, corn and cotton reduced the amount of pesticides used overall, but did result in a slightly greater amount of herbicides used for soy specifically. The use of GE soy was also associated with greater conservation tillage, indirectly leading to better soil conservation, as well as increased income from off-farming sources due to the greater ease with which the crops can be managed. Though the overall estimated benefits of the adoption of GE soybeans in the United States was $310 million, the majority of this benefit was experienced by the companies selling the seeds (40%), followed by biotechnology firms (28%) and farmers (20%). The patent on glyphosate-tolerant soybeans expired in 2014, so benefits can be expected to shift.

== Adverse effects ==

=== Soy allergy ===

Allergy to soy is common, and the food is listed with other foods that commonly cause allergy, such as milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, shellfish. The problem has been reported among younger children, and the diagnosis of soy allergy is often based on symptoms reported by parents and results of skin tests or blood tests for allergy. Only a few reported studies have attempted to confirm allergy to soy by direct challenge with the food under controlled conditions. It is very difficult to give a reliable estimate of the true prevalence of soy allergy in the general population. To the extent that it does exist, soy allergy may cause cases of urticaria and angioedema, usually within minutes to hours of ingestion. In rare cases, true anaphylaxis may also occur. The reason for the discrepancy is likely that soy proteins, the causative factor in allergy, are far less potent at triggering allergy symptoms than the proteins of peanut and shellfish. An allergy test that is positive demonstrates that the immune system has formed IgE antibodies to soy proteins. However, this is only a factor when soy proteins reach the blood without being digested, in sufficient quantities to reach a threshold to provoke actual symptoms.

Soy can also trigger symptoms via food intolerance, a situation where no allergic mechanism can be proven. One scenario is seen in very young infants who have vomiting and diarrhoea when fed soy-based formula, which resolves when the formula is withdrawn. Older infants can suffer a more severe disorder with vomiting, diarrhoea that may be bloody, anemia, weight loss and failure to thrive. The most common cause of this unusual disorder is a sensitivity to cow&#x27;s milk, but soy formulas can also be the trigger. The precise mechanism is unclear and it could be immunologic, although not through the IgE-type antibodies that have the leading role in urticaria and anaphylaxis. However, it is also self-limiting and will often disappear in the toddler years.

In the European Union, identifying the presence of soy either as an ingredient or unintended contaminant in packaged food is compulsory. The regulation (EC) 1169/2011 on food-labeling lists 14 allergens, including soy, in packaged food must be clearly indicated on the label as part of the list of ingredients, using a distinctive typography (such as bold type or capital letters).

===Thyroid function===
One review noted that soy-based foods may inhibit absorption of thyroid hormone medications required for treatment of hypothyroidism. A 2015 scientific review by the European Food Safety Authority concluded that intake of isoflavones from supplements did not affect thyroid hormone levels in postmenopausal women.

== Uses ==

Among the legumes, the soybean is valued for its high (38–45%) protein content as well as its high (approximately 20%) oil content. Soybeans are the most valuable agricultural export of the United States. Approximately 85% of the world&#x27;s soybean crop is processed into soybean meal and soybean oil, the remainder processed in other ways or eaten whole.

Soybeans can be broadly classified as &quot;vegetable&quot; (garden) or field (oil) types. Vegetable types cook more easily, have a mild, nutty flavor, and better texture, are larger in size, higher in protein, and are lower in oil than field types. Tofu, soy milk, and soy sauce are among the top edible commodities made using soybeans. Producers prefer the higher protein cultivars bred from vegetable soybeans originally brought to the United States in the late 1930s. The &quot;garden&quot; cultivars are generally not suitable for mechanical combine harvesting because there is a tendency for the pods to shatter upon reaching maturity.

===Nutrition===

A 100-gram reference quantity of raw soybeans supplies of food energy and are 9% water, 30% carbohydrates, 20% total fat and 36% protein.
Peanuts are the only legumes with a higher fat content (48%) and calorie count (2,385 kJ). They contain less carbohydrates (21%), protein (25%) and dietary fiber (9%).

Soybeans are a rich source of essential nutrients, providing in a 100-gram serving (raw, for reference) high contents of the Daily Value (DV) especially for protein (36% DV), dietary fiber (37%), iron (121%), manganese (120%), phosphorus (101%) and several B vitamins, including folate (94%) (table). High contents also exist for vitamin K, magnesium, zinc and potassium.

For human consumption, soybeans must be processed prior to consumption–either by cooking, roasting, or fermenting–to destroy the trypsin inhibitors (serine protease inhibitors). Raw soybeans, including the immature green form, are toxic to all monogastric animals.

====Protein====

Most soy protein is a relatively heat-stable storage protein. This heat stability enables soy food products requiring high temperature cooking, such as tofu, soy milk and textured vegetable protein (soy flour) to be made. Soy protein is essentially identical to the protein of other legume seeds and pulses.

Soy is a good source of protein for vegetarians and vegans or for people who want to reduce the amount of meat they eat, according to the US Food and Drug Administration:

Although soybeans have high protein content, soybeans also contain high levels of protease inhibitors, which can prevent digestion. Protease inhibitors are reduced by cooking soybeans, and are present in low levels in soy products such as tofu and soy milk.

The Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS) of soy protein is the nutritional equivalent of meat, eggs, and casein for human growth and health. Soybean protein isolate has a biological value of 74, whole soybeans 96, soybean milk 91, and eggs 97.
All spermatophytes, except for the family of grasses and cereals (Poaceae), contain 7S (vicilin) and 11S (legumin) soy protein-like globulin storage proteins; or only one of these globulin proteins. S denotes Svedberg, sedimentation coefficients. Oats and rice are anomalous in that they also contain a majority of soybean-like protein. Cocoa, for example, contains the 7S globulin, which contributes to cocoa/chocolate taste and aroma, whereas coffee beans (coffee grounds) contain the 11S globulin responsible for coffee&#x27;s aroma and flavor.

Vicilin and legumin proteins belong to the cupin superfamily, a large family of functionally diverse proteins that have a common origin and whose evolution can be followed from bacteria to eukaryotes including animals and higher plants.

2S albumins form a major group of homologous storage proteins in many dicot species and in some monocots but not in grasses (cereals). Soybeans contain a small but significant 2S storage protein. 2S albumin are grouped in the prolamin superfamily. Other allergenic proteins included in this &#x27;superfamily&#x27; are the non-specific plant lipid transfer proteins, alpha amylase inhibitor, trypsin inhibitors, and prolamin storage proteins of cereals and grasses.

Peanuts, for instance, contain 20% 2S albumin but only 6% 7S globulin and 74% 11S. It is the high 2S albumin and low 7S globulin that is responsible for the relatively low lysine content of peanut protein compared to soy protein.

====Carbohydrates====
The principal soluble carbohydrates of mature soybeans are the disaccharide sucrose (range 2.5–8.2%), the trisaccharide raffinose (0.1–1.0%) composed of one sucrose molecule connected to one molecule of galactose, and the tetrasaccharide stachyose (1.4 to 4.1%) composed of one sucrose connected to two molecules of galactose. While the oligosaccharides raffinose and stachyose protect the viability of the soybean seed from desiccation (see above section on physical characteristics) they are not digestible sugars, so contribute to flatulence and abdominal discomfort in humans and other monogastric animals, comparable to the disaccharide trehalose. Undigested oligosaccharides are broken down in the intestine by native microbes, producing gases such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and methane.

Since soluble soy carbohydrates are found in the whey and are broken down during fermentation, soy concentrate, soy protein isolates, tofu, soy sauce, and sprouted soybeans are without flatus activity. On the other hand, there may be some beneficial effects to ingesting oligosaccharides such as raffinose and stachyose, namely, encouraging indigenous bifidobacteria in the colon against putrefactive bacteria.

The insoluble carbohydrates in soybeans consist of the complex polysaccharides cellulose, hemicellulose, and pectin. The majority of soybean carbohydrates can be classed as belonging to dietary fiber.

====Fats====
Raw soybeans are 20% fat, including saturated fat (3%), monounsaturated fat (4%) and polyunsaturated fat, mainly as linoleic acid (table).

Within soybean oil or the lipid portion of the seed is contained four phytosterols: stigmasterol, sitosterol, campesterol, and brassicasterol accounting for about 2.5% of the lipid fraction; and which can be converted into steroid hormones. Additionally soybeans are a rich source of sphingolipids.

====Other constituents====
Soy contains isoflavones—polyphenolic compounds, produced by legumes including peanuts and chickpeas. Isoflavones are closely related to flavonoids found in other plants, vegetables and flowers.

Soy contains the phytoestrogen coumestans, also are found in beans and split-peas, with the best sources being alfalfa, clover, and soybean sprouts. Coumestrol, an isoflavone coumarin derivative, is the only coumestan in foods.

Saponins, a class of natural surfactants (soaps), are sterols that are present in small amounts in various plant foods, including soybeans, other legumes, and cereals, such as oats.

===Comparison to other major staple foods===
The following table shows the nutrient content of green soybean and other major staple foods, each in respective raw form on a dry weight basis to account for their different water contents. Raw soybeans, however, are not edible and cannot be digested. These must be sprouted, or prepared and cooked for human consumption. In sprouted and cooked form, the relative nutritional and anti-nutritional contents of each of these grains is remarkably different from that of raw form of these grains reported in this table. The nutritional value of soybean and each cooked staple depends on the processing and the method of cooking: boiling, frying, roasting, baking, etc.
===Soybean oil===

Soybean seed contains 18–19% oil. To extract soybean oil from seed, the soybeans are cracked, adjusted for moisture content, rolled into flakes, and solvent-extracted with commercial hexane. The oil is then refined, blended for different applications, and sometimes hydrogenated. Soybean oils, both liquid and partially hydrogenated, are exported abroad, sold as &quot;vegetable oil,&quot; or end up in a wide variety of processed foods.

===Soybean meal===

Soybean meal, or soymeal, is the material remaining after solvent extraction of oil from soybean flakes, with a 50% soy protein content. The meal is &#x27;toasted&#x27; (a misnomer because the heat treatment is with moist steam) and ground in a hammer mill. Ninety-seven percent of soybean meal production globally is used as livestock feed. Soybean meal is also used in some dog foods.

===Livestock feed===
One of the major uses of soybeans globally is as livestock feed, predominantly in the form of soybean meal. In the European Union, for example, though it does not make up most of the weight of livestock feed, soybean meal provides around 60% of the protein fed to livestock. In the United States, 70 percent of soybean production is used for animal feed, with poultry being the number one livestock sector of soybean consumption. Spring grasses are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, whereas soy is predominantly omega-6. The soybean hulls, which mainly consist of the outer coats of the beans removed before oil extraction, can also be fed to livestock and whole soybean seeds after processing.

===Food for human consumption===

In addition to their use in livestock feed, soybean products are widely used for human consumption. Common soybean products include soy sauce, soy milk, tofu, soy meal, soy flour, textured vegetable protein (TVP), soy curls, tempeh, soy lecithin and soybean oil. Soybeans may also be eaten with minimal processing, for example, in the Japanese food , in which immature soybeans are boiled whole in their pods and served with salt.

In China, Japan, Vietnam and Korea, soybean and soybean products are a standard part of the diet. Tofu (豆腐 &quot;dòufu&quot;) is thought to have originated in China, along with soy sauce and several varieties of soybean paste used as seasonings. Japanese foods made from soya include &quot;miso&quot; (), &quot;nattō&quot; (), &quot;kinako&quot; () and &quot;edamame&quot; (), as well as products made with tofu such as atsuage and aburaage. In China, whole dried soybeans are sold in supermarkets and used to cook various dishes, usually after rehydration by soaking in water; they find their use in soup or as a savory dish. In Korean cuisine, soybean sprouts ( &quot;kongnamul&quot;) are used in a variety of dishes, and soybeans are the base ingredient in &quot;doenjang&quot;, &quot;cheonggukjang&quot; and &quot;ganjang&quot;. In Vietnam, soybeans are used to make soybean paste (&quot;tương&quot;) in the North with the most popular products are &quot;tương Bần&quot;, &quot;tương Nam Đàn&quot;, &quot;tương Cự Đà&quot; as a garnish for &quot;phở&quot; and &quot;gỏi cuốn&quot; dishes, as well as tofu ( or or ), soy sauce (), soy milk ( in the North or in the South), and (tofu sweet soup).

====Flour====

Soy flour refers to soybeans ground finely enough to pass through a 100-mesh or smaller screen where special care was taken during desolventizing (not toasted) to minimize denaturation of the protein to retain a high protein dispersibility index, for uses such as food extrusion of textured vegetable protein. It is the starting material for soy concentrate and protein isolate production.

Soy flour can also be made by roasting the soybean, removing the coat (hull), and grinding it into flour. Soy flour is manufactured with different fat levels. Alternatively, raw soy flour omits the roasting step.
* Defatted soy flour is obtained from solvent extracted flakes and contains less than 1% oil.
* &quot;Natural or full-fat soy flour is made from unextracted, dehulled beans and contains about 18% to 20% oil.&quot; Its high oil content requires the use of a specialized Alpine Fine Impact Mill to grind rather than the usual hammer mill. Full-fat soy flour has a lower protein concentration than defatted flour. Extruded full-fat soy flour, ground in an Alpine mill, can replace/extend eggs in baking and cooking. Full-fat soy flour is a component of the famous Cornell bread recipe.
* Low-fat soy flour is made by adding some oil back into defatted soy flour. Fat levels range from 4.5% to 9%.
* High-fat soy flour can also be produced by adding back soybean oil to defatted flour, usually at 15%.

Soy lecithin can be added (up to 15%) to soy flour to make lecithinated soy flour. It increases dispersibility and gives it emulsifying properties.

Soy flour has 50% protein and 5% fiber. It has higher levels of protein, thiamine, riboflavin, phosphorus, calcium, and iron than wheat flour. It does not contain gluten. As a result, yeast-raised breads made with soy flour are dense in texture. Among many uses, soy flour thickens sauces, prevents staling in baked food, and reduces oil absorption during frying. Baking food with soy flour gives it tenderness, moistness, a rich color, and a fine texture.

Soy grits are similar to soy flour, except the soybeans have been toasted and cracked into coarse pieces.

&quot;Kinako&quot; is a soy flour used in Japanese cuisine.

====Soy-based infant formula====
Soy-based infant formula (SBIF) is sometimes given to infants who are not being strictly breastfed; it can be useful for infants who are either allergic to pasteurized cow milk proteins or who are being fed a vegan diet. It is sold in powdered, ready-to-feed, and concentrated liquid forms.

Some reviews have expressed the opinion that more research is needed to determine what effect the phytoestrogens in soybeans may have on infants. Diverse studies have concluded there are no adverse effects in human growth, development, or reproduction as a result of the consumption of soy-based infant formula. One of these studies, published in the &quot;Journal of Nutrition&quot;, concludes that there are:

... no clinical concerns with respect to nutritional adequacy, sexual development, neurobehavioral development, immune development, or thyroid disease. SBIFs provide complete nutrition that adequately supports normal infant growth and development. FDA has accepted SBIFs as safe for use as the sole source of nutrition.

====Meat and dairy alternatives and extenders====
Soybeans can be processed to produce a texture and appearance similar to many other foods. For example, soybeans are the primary ingredient in many dairy product substitutes (e.g., soy milk, margarine, soy ice cream, soy yogurt, soy cheese, and soy cream cheese) and meat alternatives (e.g. veggie burgers). These substitutes are readily available in most supermarkets. Soy milk does not naturally contain significant amounts of digestible calcium. Many manufacturers of soy milk sell calcium-enriched products, as well.

Soy products also are used as a low-cost substitute for meat and poultry products. Food service, retail and institutional (primarily school lunch and correctional) facilities regularly use such &quot;extended&quot; products. The extension may result in diminished flavor, but fat and cholesterol are reduced. Vitamin and mineral fortification can be used to make soy products nutritionally equivalent to animal protein; the protein quality is already roughly equivalent. The soy-based meat substitute textured vegetable protein has been used for more than 50 years as a way of inexpensively extending ground beef without reducing its nutritional value.

====Soy nut butter====
The soybean is used to make a product called soy nut butter which is similar in texture to peanut butter.

==== Sweetened soybean ====
Sweet-boiled beans are popular in Japan and Korea, and the sweet-boiled soybeans are called &quot;Daizu no &quot; in Japan and Kongjorim () in Korea. Sweet-boiled beans are even used in sweetened buns, especially in .

The boiled and pasted edamame, called , is used as one of the Sweet bean pastes in Japanese confections.

==== Coffee substitute ====
Roasted and ground soybeans can be a caffeine-free substitute for coffee. After the soybeans are roasted and ground, they look similar to regular coffee beans or can be used as a powder similar to instant coffee, with the aroma and flavor of roasted soybeans.

===Other products===

Soybeans with black hulls are used in Chinese fermented black beans, &quot;douchi&quot;, not to be confused with black turtle beans.

Soybeans are also used in industrial products, including oils, soap, cosmetics, resins, plastics, inks, crayons, solvents, and clothing. Soybean oil is the primary source of biodiesel in the United States, accounting for 80% of domestic biodiesel production. Soybeans have also been used since 2001 as fermenting stock in the manufacture of a brand of vodka. In 1936, Ford Motor Company developed a method where soybeans and fibers were rolled together producing a soup which was then pressed into various parts for their cars, from the distributor cap to knobs on the dashboard. Ford also informed in public relation releases that in 1935 over five million acres (20,000 km) was dedicated to growing soybeans in the United States.

===Potential health benefits===
===Reducing risk of cancer===
According to the American Cancer Society, &quot;There is growing evidence that eating traditional soy foods such as tofu may lower the risk of cancers of the breast, prostate, or endometrium (lining of the uterus), and there is some evidence it may lower the risk of certain other cancers.&quot; There is insufficient research to indicate whether taking soy dietary supplements (e.g., as a pill or capsule) has any effect on health or cancer risk.

As of 2018, rigorous dietary clinical research in people with cancer has proved inconclusive.

====Breast cancer====
Although considerable research has examined the potential for soy consumption to lower the risk of breast cancer in women, as of 2016 there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion about a relationship between soy consumption and any effects on breast cancer. A 2011 meta-analysis stated: &quot;Our study suggests soy isoflavones intake is associated with a significant reduced risk of breast cancer incidence in Asian populations, but not in Western populations.&quot;

====Gastrointestinal and colorectal cancer====
Reviews of preliminary clinical trials on people with colorectal or gastrointestinal cancer suggest that soy isoflavones may have a slight protective effect against such cancers.

====Prostate cancer====
A 2016 review concluded that &quot;current evidence from observational studies and small clinical trials is not robust enough to understand whether soy protein or isoflavone supplements may help prevent or inhibit the progression of prostate cancer.&quot; A 2010 review showed that neither soy foods nor isoflavone supplements alter measures of bioavailable testosterone or estrogen concentrations in men. Soy consumption has been shown to have no effect on the levels and quality of sperm. Meta-analyses on the association between soy consumption and prostate cancer risk in men concluded that dietary soy may lower the risk of prostate cancer.

===Cardiovascular health===
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted the following health claim for soy: &quot;25 grams of soy protein a day, as part of a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol, may reduce the risk of heart disease.&quot; One serving, (1 cup or 240 mL) of soy milk, for instance, contains 6 or 7 grams of soy protein.

An American Heart Association (AHA) review of a decade long study of soy protein benefits did not recommend isoflavone supplementation. The review panel also found that soy isoflavones have not been shown to reduce post-menopausal &quot;hot flashes&quot; and the efficacy and safety of isoflavones to help prevent cancers of the breast, uterus or prostate is in question. AHA concluded that &quot;many soy products should be beneficial to cardiovascular and overall health because of their high content of polyunsaturated fats, fiber, vitamins, and minerals and low content of saturated fat&quot;. Other studies found that soy protein consumption could lower the concentration of low-density lipoproteins (LDL) transporting fats in the extracellular water to cells.

===Research by constituent===
====Lignans====
Plant lignans are associated with high fiber foods such as cereal brans and beans are the principal precursor to mammalian lignans which have an ability to bind to human estrogen sites. Soybeans are a significant source of mammalian lignan precursor secoisolariciresinol containing 13–273 μg/100 g dry weight.

====Phytochemicals====
Soybeans and processed soy foods are among the richest foods in total phytoestrogens (wet basis per 100 g), which are present primarily in the form of the isoflavones, daidzein and genistein. Because most naturally occurring phytoestrogens act as selective estrogen receptor modulators, or SERMs, which do not necessarily act as direct agonists of estrogen receptors, normal consumption of foods that contain these phytoestrogens should not provide sufficient amounts to elicit a physiological response in humans. The major product of daidzein microbial metabolism is equol. Only 33% of Western Europeans have a microbiome that produces equol, compared to 50–55% of Asians.

Soy isoflavones—polyphenolic compounds that are also produced by other legumes like peanuts and chickpeas—are under preliminary research. As of 2016, no cause-and-effect relationship has been shown in clinical research to indicate that soy isoflavones lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

====Phytic acid====
Soybeans contain phytic acid, which may act as a chelating agent and inhibit mineral absorption, especially for diets already low in minerals.

==In culture==

Although observations of soy consumption inducing gynecomastia on men are not conclusive, a pejorative term, &quot;soy boy&quot;, has emerged to describe perceived emasculated young men with feminine traits.

<doc id="62785" wikidata="Q1377879" url="?curid=62785" title="Edamame">
<text>is an East Asian dish prepared with immature soybeans in their pods, which are boiled or steamed, and may be served with salt or other condiments. The dish has become popular across the world because it is rich in vitamins, dietary fiber, and isoflavones. When the beans are outside the pod, the term mukimame is also sometimes used in Japanese. Edamame is a common side dish in Japanese cuisine and as an appetizer to alcoholic beverages such as beer or shōchū. As an ingredient, edamame is found in both sweet and savory dishes such as takikomi gohan, tempura, and zunda-mochi.

==Name==

In Japanese, the name &quot;edamame&quot; is commonly used to refer to the dish. It literally means &quot;stem beans&quot; (枝 &quot;eda&quot; = &quot;branch&quot; or &quot;stem&quot; + 豆 &quot;mame&quot; = &quot;bean&quot;), because the beans were often sold while still attached to the stem.

In Chinese, &quot;maodou&quot; is used commonly to refer to the dish, which literally means &quot;fur peas&quot; (毛 &quot;máo&quot; = &quot;fur&quot; + 豆 &quot;dòu&quot; = &quot;bean&quot;).

==History==
Soybeans were first cultivated in China some 7000 years ago, while the earliest documented reference to the term &quot;edamame&quot; dates from the year 1275, when the Japanese monk Nichiren wrote a note thanking a parishioner for the gift of &quot;edamame&quot; he had left at the temple.
In 1406, during the Ming dynasty in China, the leaves of the soybeans were eaten and during outbreaks of famine; it was recommended that citizens eat the beans whole or use them ground up and added to flour. Centuries later, in China, in 1620, they are referred to again, but as &quot;maodou&quot;, which translates to the term &quot;hairy bean&quot;. They are found in the records of the Runan vegetable gardens, where they are stated as having a medicinal purpose, as well as being a snack food. Edamame appeared in haikai verse in Japanese in the Edo period (1603–1868), with one example as early as 1638.

They were first recognized in the United States in 1855, when a farmer commented on the difficulties he had shelling them after harvest. In March 1923, the immature soybean is first referred to in text in the United States in the book &quot;The Soybean&quot; by C. V. Piper and Joseph W. Morse. In this book, they are first pictured and shown as being eaten out of open shell pods. The first nutritional facts about them are published and some recipes are included, as they were a new type of vegetable to the public. The earliest recorded usage in English of the word &quot;edamame&quot; is in 1951 in the journal &quot;Folklore Studies&quot;. 

Writing in the &quot;New York Times&quot; in 1999, food writer Florence Fabricant reported that frozen edamame beans were starting to be sold in supermarkets and speciality food retailers in New York and New Jersey. &quot;Edamame&quot; appeared as a new term in the Oxford English Dictionary in 2003 and in the Merriam-Webster dictionary in 2008.

In 2008, the first soybeans grown in Europe were sold in grocery stores as edamame and eaten as an alternative source of protein.

==Preparation==
===Harvesting===
Edamame is typically harvested by hand to avoid damaging the crop&#x27;s stems and leaves. Green soybean pods are picked before they fully ripen, typically 35 to 40 days after the crop first flowers. Soybeans harvested at this stage are sweeter because they contain more sucrose than soybeans picked later in the growing season. Other factors contributing to edamame&#x27;s flavor include free amino acids such as glutamic acid, aspartic acid, and alanine. Often these unbound amino acids decrease as the pods fully expand and ripen.

===Cooking===
Pods may be boiled in water, steamed, or microwaved. The ends of the pod are sometimes cut before boiling or steaming. The most common preparations use salt for taste, either dissolved in the boiling water before introducing the soybean pods or added after cooking.

Edamame is a popular side dish at Japanese izakaya restaurants with local varieties being in demand, depending on the season. Salt and garlic are typical condiments for edamame. In Japan, a coarse salt wet with brine is preferred on beans eaten directly from the pod.

===Storage===
Edamame purchased fresh is preferably eaten the same day, with flavor degradation being noticeable in as few as 10 hours after harvest. However, fresh edamame will stay edible for three days when stored in the refrigerator. Damaged pods brown more rapidly however, mainly due to the enzyme polyphenol oxidase. If stored fresh, the pods should be kept humid to prevent discoloration and wilting. This can be accomplished by wrapping the pods in plastic or another material which traps moisture.

Freezing fresh edamame is another option for maintaining good quality over a few months. Fresh edamame should be blanched first before being frozen.

===Eating ===
Edamame can come in two forms: pods or beans. Edamame beans are easy to eat and can be cooked just like any other type of beans. The edamame pods require using the teeth or fingers to slide the edamame beans into the mouth, after which the pods (or shells) are discarded.

==Nutrition==
The United States Department of Agriculture states that edamame beans are a &quot;soybean that can be eaten fresh and are best known as a snack with a nutritional punch&quot;. Frozen, prepared edamame beans are 73% water, 12% protein, 9% carbohydrates, and 5% fat. A 100-gram reference serving of edamame provides of food energy, and rich amounts (20% or more the Daily Value, DV) of protein, dietary fiber, and micronutrients, particularly folate (78% DV), manganese (49% DV), and vitamin K (26% DV) (table). The fat content in edamame supplies 361 mg of omega-3 fatty acids and 1794 mg of omega-6 fatty acids.

<text>The Fabaceae () or Leguminosae, commonly known as the legume, pea, or bean family, are a large and agriculturally important family of flowering plants. It includes trees, shrubs, and perennial or annual herbaceous plants, which are easily recognized by their fruit (legume) and their compound, stipulate leaves. The family is widely distributed, and is the third-largest land plant family in number of species, behind only the Orchidaceae and Asteraceae, with about 765 genera and nearly 20,000 known species.

The five largest genera of the family are &quot;Astragalus&quot; (over 3,000 species), &quot;Acacia&quot; (over 1,000 species), &quot;Indigofera&quot; (around 700 species), &quot;Crotalaria&quot; (around 700 species), and &quot;Mimosa&quot; (around 400 species), which constitute about a quarter of all legume species. The c. 19,000 known legume species amount to about 7% of flowering plant species. Fabaceae is the most common family found in tropical rainforests and dry forests of the Americas and Africa.

Recent molecular and morphological evidence supports the fact that the Fabaceae is a single monophyletic family. This conclusion has been supported not only by the degree of interrelation shown by different groups within the family compared with that found among the Leguminosae and their closest relations, but also by all the recent phylogenetic studies based on DNA sequences. These studies confirm that the Fabaceae are a monophyletic group that is closely related to the families Polygalaceae, Surianaceae and Quillajaceae and that they belong to the order Fabales.

Along with the cereals, some fruits and tropical roots, a number of Leguminosae have been a staple human food for millennia and their use is closely related to human evolution.

The family Fabaceae includes a number of plants that are common in agriculture including &quot;Glycine max&quot; (soybean), &quot;Phaseolus&quot; (beans), &quot;Pisum sativum&quot; (pea), &quot;Cicer arietinum&quot; (chickpeas), &quot;Vicia faba&quot; (broad bean), &quot;Medicago sativa&quot; (alfalfa), &quot;Arachis hypogaea&quot; (peanut), &quot;Ceratonia siliqua&quot; (carob), &quot;Trigonella foenum-graecum&quot; (fenugreek), and &quot;Glycyrrhiza glabra&quot; (liquorice). A number of species are also weedy pests in different parts of the world, including &quot;Cytisus scoparius&quot; (broom), &quot;Robinia pseudoacacia&quot; (black locust)&quot;, Ulex europaeus&quot; (gorse), &quot;Pueraria montana&quot; (kudzu), and a number of &quot;Lupinus&quot; species.

== Etymology ==

The name &#x27;Fabaceae&#x27; comes from the defunct genus &quot;Faba&quot;, now included in &quot;Vicia&quot;. The term &quot;faba&quot; comes from Latin, and appears to simply mean &quot;bean&quot;. Leguminosae is an older name still considered valid, and refers to the fruit of these plants, which are called legumes.

== Description ==

Fabaceae range in habit from giant trees (like &quot;Koompassia excelsa&quot;) to small annual herbs, with the majority being herbaceous perennials. Plants have indeterminate inflorescences, which are sometimes reduced to a single flower. The flowers have a short hypanthium and a single carpel with a short gynophore, and after fertilization produce fruits that are legumes.

=== Growth habit ===

The Fabaceae have a wide variety of growth forms, including trees, shrubs, herbaceous plants, and even vines or lianas. The herbaceous plants can be annuals, biennials, or perennials, without basal or terminal leaf aggregations. Many Legumes have tendrils. They are upright plants, epiphytes, or vines. The latter support themselves by means of shoots that twist around a support or through cauline or foliar tendrils. Plants can be heliophytes, mesophytes, or xerophytes.

=== Leaves ===

The leaves are usually alternate and compound. Most often they are even- or odd-pinnately compound (e.g. &quot;Caragana&quot; and &quot;Robinia&quot; respectively), often trifoliate (e.g. &quot;Trifolium&quot;, &quot;Medicago&quot;) and rarely palmately compound (e.g. &quot;Lupinus&quot;), in the Mimosoideae and the Caesalpinioideae commonly bipinnate (e.g. &quot;Acacia&quot;, &quot;Mimosa&quot;). They always have stipules, which can be leaf-like (e.g. &quot;Pisum&quot;), thornlike (e.g. &quot;Robinia&quot;) or be rather inconspicuous. Leaf margins are entire or, occasionally, serrate. Both the leaves and the leaflets often have wrinkled pulvini to permit nastic movements. In some species, leaflets have evolved into tendrils (e.g. &quot;Vicia&quot;).

Many species have leaves with structures that attract ants which protect the plant from herbivore insects (a form of mutualism). Extrafloral nectaries are common among the Mimosoideae and the Caesalpinioideae, and are also found in some Faboideae (e.g. &quot;Vicia sativa&quot;). In some &quot;Acacia&quot;, the modified hollow stipules are inhabited by ants and are known as domatia.

=== Roots ===

Many Fabaceae host bacteria in their roots within structures called root nodules. These bacteria, known as rhizobia, have the ability to take nitrogen gas (N2) out of the air and convert it to a form of nitrogen that is usable to the host plant (NO3− or NH3). This process is called nitrogen fixation. The legume, acting as a host, and rhizobia, acting as a provider of usable nitrate, form a symbiotic relationship. Members of the Phaseoleae genus &quot;Apios&quot; form tubers, which can be edible.

=== Flowers ===


The flowers often have five generally fused sepals and five free petals. They are generally hermaphroditic and have a short hypanthium, usually cup-shaped. There are normally ten stamens and one elongated superior ovary, with a curved style. They are usually arranged in indeterminate inflorescences. Fabaceae are typically entomophilous plants (i.e. they are pollinated by insects), and the flowers are usually showy to attract pollinators.

In the Caesalpinioideae, the flowers are often zygomorphic, as in &quot;Cercis&quot;, or nearly symmetrical with five equal petals, as in &quot;Bauhinia&quot;. The upper petal is the innermost one, unlike in the Faboideae. Some species, like some in the genus &quot;Senna&quot;, have asymmetric flowers, with one of the lower petals larger than the opposing one, and the style bent to one side. The calyx, corolla, or stamens can be showy in this group.

In the Mimosoideae, the flowers are actinomorphic and arranged in globose inflorescences. The petals are small and the stamens, which can be more than just 10, have long, coloured filaments, which are the showiest part of the flower. All of the flowers in an inflorescence open at once.

In the Faboideae, the flowers are zygomorphic, and have a specialized structure. The upper petal, called the banner or standard, is large and envelops the rest of the petals in bud, often reflexing when the flower blooms. The two adjacent petals, the wings, surround the two bottom petals. The two bottom petals are fused together at the apex (remaining free at the base), forming a boat-like structure called the keel. The stamens are always ten in number, and their filaments can be fused in various configurations, often in a group of nine stamens plus one separate stamen. Various genes in the &quot;CYCLOIDEA (CYC)/DICHOTOMA (DICH)&quot; family are expressed in the upper (also called dorsal or adaxial) petal; in some species, such as &quot;Cadia&quot;, these genes are expressed throughout the flower, producing a radially symmetrical flower.

=== Fruit ===

The ovary most typically develops into a legume. A legume is a simple dry fruit that usually dehisces (opens along a seam) on two sides. A common name for this type of fruit is a &quot;pod&quot;, although that can also be applied to a few other fruit types. A few species have evolved samarae, loments, follicles, indehiscent legumes, achenes, drupes, and berries from the basic legume fruit.

=== Physiology and biochemistry ===

The Fabaceae are rarely cyanogenic. Where they are, the cyanogenic compounds are derived from tyrosine, phenylalanine or leucine. They frequently contain alkaloids. Proanthocyanidins can be present either as cyanidin or delphinidine or both at the same time. Flavonoids such as kaempferol, quercitin and myricetin are often present. Ellagic acid has never been found in any of the genera or species analysed. Sugars are transported within the plants in the form of sucrose. C3 photosynthesis has been found in a wide variety of genera. The family has also evolved a unique chemistry. Many legumes contain toxic and indigestible substances, antinutrients, which may be removed through various processing methods. Pterocarpans are a class of molecules (derivatives of isoflavonoids) found only in the Fabaceae. Forisome proteins are found in the sieve tubes of Fabaceae; uniquely they are not dependent on ADT.

== Evolution, phylogeny and taxonomy ==

=== Evolution ===

The order Fabales contains around 7.3% of eudicot species and the greatest part of this diversity is contained in just one of the four families that the order contains: Fabaceae. This clade also includes the families Polygalaceae, Surianaceae and Quillajaceae and its origins date back 94 to 89 million years, although it started its diversification 79 to 74 million years ago. The Fabaceae diversified during the Paleogene to become a ubiquitous part of the modern earth&#x27;s biota, along with many other families belonging to the flowering plants.

The Fabaceae have an abundant and diverse fossil record, especially for the Tertiary period. Fossils of flowers, fruit, leaves, wood and pollen from this period have been found in numerous locations. The earliest fossils that can be definitively assigned to the Fabaceae appeared in the early Palaeocene (approximately 65 million years ago). Representatives of the 3 sub-families traditionally recognised as being members of the Fabaceae – Cesalpinioideae, Papilionoideae and Mimosoideaeas well as members of the large clades within these sub-familiessuch as the genistoideshave been found in periods later, starting between 55 and 50 million years ago. In fact, a wide variety of taxa representing the main lineages in the Fabaceae have been found in the fossil record dating from the middle to the late Eocene, suggesting that the majority of the modern Fabaceae groups were already present and that a broad diversification occurred during this period. Therefore, the Fabaceae started their diversification approximately 60 million years ago and the most important clades separated 50 million years ago. The age of the main Cesalpinioideae clades have been estimated as between 56 and 34 million years and the basal group of the Mimosoideae as 44 ± 2.6 million years. The division between Mimosoideae and Faboideae is dated as occurring between 59 and 34 million years ago and the basal group of the Faboideae as 58.6 ± 0.2 million years ago. It has been possible to date the divergence of some of the groups within the Faboideae, even though diversification within each genus was relatively recent. For instance, &quot;Astragalus&quot; separated from the &quot;Oxytropis&quot; 16 to 12 million years ago. In addition, the separation of the aneuploid species of &quot;Neoastragalus&quot; started 4 million years ago. &quot;Inga&quot;, another genus of the Papilionoideae with approximately 350 species, seems to have diverged in the last 2 million years.

It has been suggested, based on fossil and phylogenetic evidence, that legumes originally evolved in arid and/or semi-arid regions along the Tethys seaway during the Palaeogene Period. However, others contend that Africa (or even the Americas) cannot yet be ruled out as the origin of the family.

The current hypothesis about the evolution of the genes needed for nodulation is that they were recruited from other pathways after a polyploidy event. Several different pathways have been implicated as donating duplicated genes to the pathways need for nodulation. The main donors to the pathway were the genes associated with the arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis genes, the pollen tube formation genes and the haemoglobin genes. One of the main genes shown to be shared between the arbuscular mycorrhiza pathway and the nodulation pathway is SYMRK and it is involved in the plant-bacterial recognition. The pollen tube growth is similar to the infection thread development in that infection threads grow in a polar manner that is similar to a pollen tubes polar growth towards the ovules. Both pathways include the same type of enzymes, pectin-degrading cell wall enzymes. The enzymes needed to reduce nitrogen, nitrogenases, require a substantial input of ATP but at the same time are sensitive to free oxygen. To meet the requirements of this paradoxical situation, the plants express a type of haemoglobin called leghaemoglobin that is believed to be recruited after a duplication event. These three genetic pathways are believed to be part of a gene duplication event then recruited to work in nodulation.

=== Phylogeny and taxonomy ===

==== Phylogeny ====

The phylogeny of the legumes has been the object of many studies by research groups from around the world. These studies have used morphology, DNA data (the chloroplast intron &quot;trnL&quot;, the chloroplast genes &quot;rbcL&quot; and &quot;matK&quot;, or the ribosomal spacers &quot;ITS&quot;) and cladistic analysis in order to investigate the relationships between the family&#x27;s different lineages. Fabaceae is consistently recovered as monophyletic. The studies further confirmed that the traditional subfamilies Mimosoideae and Papilionoideae were each monophyletic but both were nested within the paraphyletic subfamily Caesalpinioideae. All the different approaches yielded similar results regarding the relationships between the family&#x27;s main clades. Following extensive discussion in the legume phylogenetics community, the Legume Phylogeny Working Group reclassified Fabaceae into six subfamilies, which necessitated the segregation of four new subfamilies from Caesalpinioideae and merging Caesapinioideae &quot;sensu stricto&quot; with the former subfamily Mimosoideae. The exact branching order of the different subfamilies is still unresolved.

==== Taxonomy ====

The Fabaceae are placed in the order Fabales according to most taxonomic systems, including the APG III system. The family now includes six subfamilies:
* Cercidoideae: 12 genera and ~335 species. Mainly tropical. &quot;Bauhinia&quot;, &quot;Cercis&quot;.
* Detarioideae: 84 genera and ~760 species. Mainly tropical. &quot;Amherstia&quot;, &quot;Detarium&quot;, &quot;Tamarindus&quot;.
* Duparquetioideae: 1 genus and 1 species. West and Central Africa. &quot;Duparquetia&quot;.
* Dialioideae: 17 genera and ~85 species. Widespread throughout the tropics. &quot;Dialium&quot;.
* Caesalpinioideae: 148 genera and ~4400 species. Pantropical. &quot;Caesalpinia&quot;, &quot;Senna&quot;, &quot;Mimosa&quot;, &quot;Acacia&quot;. Includes the former subfamily Mimosoideae (80 genera and ~3200 species; mostly tropical and warm temperate Asia and America).
* Faboideae (Papilionoideae): 503 genera and ~14,000 species. Cosmopolitan. &quot;Astragalus&quot;, &quot;Lupinus&quot;, &quot;Pisum&quot;.

== Ecology ==

=== Distribution and habitat ===

The Fabaceae have an essentially worldwide distribution, being found everywhere except Antarctica and the high Arctic. The trees are often found in tropical regions, while the herbaceous plants and shrubs are predominant outside the tropics.

=== Biological nitrogen fixation ===


Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF, performed by the organisms called diazotrophs) is a very old process that probably originated in the Archean eon when the primitive atmosphere lacked oxygen. It is only carried out by Euryarchaeota and just 6 of the more than 50 phyla of bacteria. Some of these lineages co-evolved together with the flowering plants establishing the molecular basis of a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship. BNF is carried out in nodules that are mainly located in the root cortex, although they are occasionally located in the stem as in &quot;Sesbania rostrata&quot;. The spermatophytes that co-evolved with actinorhizal diazotrophs (&quot;Frankia&quot;) or with rhizobia to establish their symbiotic relationship belong to 11 families contained within the Rosidae clade (as established by the gene molecular phylogeny of &quot;rbcL&quot;, a gene coding for part of the RuBisCO enzyme in the chloroplast). This grouping indicates that the predisposition for forming nodules probably only arose once in flowering plants and that it can be considered as an ancestral characteristic that has been conserved or lost in certain lineages. However, such a wide distribution of families and genera within this lineage indicates that nodulation had multiple origins. Of the 10 families within the Rosidae, 8 have nodules formed by actinomyces (Betulaceae, Casuarinaceae, Coriariaceae, Datiscaceae, Elaeagnaceae, Myricaceae, Rhamnaceae and Rosaceae), and the two remaining families, Ulmaceae and Fabaceae have nodules formed by rhizobia.

The rhizobia and their hosts must be able to recognize each other for nodule formation to commence. Rhizobia are specific to particular host species although a rhizobia species may often infect more than one host species. This means that one plant species may be infected by more than one species of bacteria. For example, nodules in &quot;Acacia senegal&quot; can contain seven species of rhizobia belonging to three different genera. The most distinctive characteristics that allow rhizobia to be distinguished apart are the rapidity of their growth and the type of root nodule that they form with their host. Root nodules can be classified as being either indeterminate, cylindrical and often branched, and determinate, spherical with prominent lenticels. Indeterminate nodules are characteristic of legumes from temperate climates, while determinate nodules are commonly found in species from tropical or subtropical climates.

Nodule formation is common throughout the Fabaceae. It is found in the majority of its members that only form an association with rhizobia, which in turn form an exclusive symbiosis with the Fabaceae (with the exception of &quot;Parasponia&quot;, the only genus of the 18 Ulmaceae genera that is capable of forming nodules). Nodule formation is present in all the Fabaceae sub-families, although it is less common in the Caesalpinioideae. All types of nodule formation are present in the subfamily Papilionoideae: indeterminate (with the meristem retained), determinate (without meristem) and the type included in &quot;Aeschynomene&quot;. The latter two are thought to be the most modern and specialised type of nodule as they are only present in some lines of the subfamily Papilionoideae. Even though nodule formation is common in the two monophyletic subfamilies Papilionoideae and Mimosoideae they also contain species that do not form nodules. The presence or absence of nodule-forming species within the three sub-families indicates that nodule formation has arisen several times during the evolution of the Fabaceae and that this ability has been lost in some lineages. For example, within the genus &quot;Acacia&quot;, a member of the Mimosoideae, &quot;A. pentagona&quot; does not form nodules, while other species of the same genus readily form nodules, as is the case for &quot;Acacia senegal&quot;, which forms both rapidly and slow growing rhizobial nodules.

=== Chemical ecology ===

A large number of species within many genera of leguminous plants, e.g. &quot;Astragalus&quot;, &quot;Coronilla&quot;, &quot;Hippocrepis&quot;, &quot;Indigofera&quot;, &quot;Lotus&quot;, &quot;Securigera&quot; and &quot;Scorpiurus&quot;, produce chemicals that derive from the compound 3-nitropropanoic acid (3-NPA, beta-nitropropionic acid). The free acid 3-NPA is an irreversible inhibitor of mitochondrial respiration, and thus the compound inhibits the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This inhibition caused by 3-NPA is especially toxic to nerve cells and represents a very general toxic mechanism suggesting a profound ecological importance due to the big number of species producing this compound and its derivatives. A second and closely related class of secondary metabolites that occur in many species of leguminous plants is defined by isoxazolin-5-one derivatives. These compounds occur in particular together with 3-NPA and related derivatives at the same time in the same species, as found in &quot;Astragalus canadensis&quot; and &quot;Astragalus collinus&quot;. 3-NPA and isoxazlin-5-one derivatives also occur in many species of leaf beetles (see defense in insects).

== Economic and cultural importance ==

Legumes are economically and culturally important plants due to their extraordinary diversity and abundance, the wide variety of edible vegetables they represent and due to the variety of uses they can be put to: in horticulture and agriculture, as a food, for the compounds they contain that have medicinal uses and for the oil and fats they contain that have a variety of uses.

=== Food and forage ===
The history of legumes is tied in closely with that of human civilization, appearing early in Asia, the Americas (the common bean, several varieties) and Europe (broad beans) by 6,000 BCE, where they became a staple, essential as a source of protein.

Their ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen reduces fertilizer costs for farmers and gardeners who grow legumes, and means that legumes can be used in a crop rotation to replenish soil that has been depleted of nitrogen. Legume seeds and foliage have a comparatively higher protein content than non-legume materials, due to the additional nitrogen that legumes receive through the process. Legumes are commonly used as natural fertilizers. Some legume species perform hydraulic lift, which makes them ideal for intercropping.

Farmed legumes can belong to numerous classes, including forage, grain, blooms, pharmaceutical/industrial, fallow/green manure and timber species, with most commercially farmed species filling two or more roles simultaneously.

There are of two broad types of forage legumes. Some, like alfalfa, clover, vetch, and &quot;Arachis&quot;, are sown in pasture and grazed by livestock. Other forage legumes such as &quot;Leucaena&quot; or &quot;Albizia&quot; are woody shrub or tree species that are either broken down by livestock or regularly cut by humans to provide fodder.

Grain legumes are cultivated for their seeds, and are also called pulses. The seeds are used for human and animal consumption or for the production of oils for industrial uses. Grain legumes include both herbaceous plants like beans, lentils, lupins, peas and peanuts, and trees such as carob, mesquite and tamarind.

&quot;Lathyrus tuberosus&quot;, once extensively cultivated in Europe, forms tubers used for human consumption.

Bloom legume species include species such as lupin, which are farmed commercially for their blooms, and thus are popular in gardens worldwide. &quot;Laburnum&quot;, &quot;Robinia&quot;, &quot;Gleditsia&quot; (honey locust), &quot;Acacia&quot;, &quot;Mimosa&quot;, and &quot;Delonix&quot; are ornamental trees and shrubs.

Industrial farmed legumes include &quot;Indigofera&quot;, cultivated for the production of indigo, &quot;Acacia&quot;, for gum arabic, and &quot;Derris&quot;, for the insecticide action of rotenone, a compound it produces.

Fallow or green manure legume species are cultivated to be tilled back into the soil to exploit the high nitrogen levels found in most legumes. Numerous legumes are farmed for this purpose, including &quot;Leucaena&quot;, &quot;Cyamopsis&quot; and &quot;Sesbania&quot;.

Various legume species are farmed for timber production worldwide, including numerous &quot;Acacia&quot; species, &quot;Dalbergia&quot; species, and &quot;Castanospermum australe&quot;.

Melliferous plants offer nectar to bees and other insects to encourage them to carry pollen from the flowers of one plant to others thereby ensuring pollination. Many Fabaceae species are important sources of pollen and nectar for bees, including for honey production in the beekeeping industry. Example Fabaceae such as alfalfa, and various clovers including white clover and sweet clover, are important sources of nectar and honey for the Western honey bee.

=== Industrial uses ===

==== Natural gums ====
Natural gums are vegetable exudates that are released as the result of damage to the plant such as that resulting from the attack of an insect or a natural or artificial cut. These exudates contain heterogeneous polysaccharides formed of different sugars and usually containing uronic acids. They form viscous colloidal solutions. There are different species that produce gums. The most important of these species belong to the Fabaceae. They are widely used in the pharmaceutical, cosmetic, food, and textile sectors. They also have interesting therapeutic properties; for example gum arabic is antitussive and anti-inflammatory. The most well known gums are tragacanth (&quot;Astragalus gummifer&quot;), gum arabic (&quot;Acacia senegal&quot;) and guar gum (&quot;Cyamopsis tetragonoloba&quot;).

=== Dyes ===

Several species of Fabaceae are used to produce dyes. The heartwood of logwood, &quot;Haematoxylon campechianum&quot;, is used to produce red and purple dyes. The histological stain called haematoxylin is produced from this species. The wood of the Brazilwood tree (&quot;Caesalpinia echinata&quot;) is also used to produce a red or purple dye. The Madras thorn (&quot;Pithecellobium dulce&quot;) has reddish fruit that are used to produce a yellow dye. Indigo dye is extracted from the indigo plant &quot;Indigofera tinctoria&quot; that is native to Asia. In Central and South America dyes are produced from two species in the same genus: indigo and Maya blue from &quot;Indigofera suffruticosa&quot; and Natal indigo from &quot;Indigofera arrecta&quot;. Yellow dyes are extracted from &quot;Butea monosperma&quot;, commonly called flame of the forest and from dyer&#x27;s greenweed, (&quot;Genista tinctoria&quot;).

=== Ornamentals ===

Legumes have been used as ornamental plants throughout the world for many centuries. Their vast diversity of heights, shapes, foliage and flower colour means that this family is commonly used in the design and planting of everything from small gardens to large parks. The following is a list of the main ornamental legume species, listed by subfamily.
* Subfamily Caesalpinioideae: &quot;Bauhinia forficata&quot;, &quot;Caesalpinia gilliesii&quot;, &quot;Caesalpinia spinosa&quot;, &quot;Ceratonia siliqua&quot;, &quot;Cercis siliquastrum&quot;, &quot;Gleditsia triacanthos&quot;, &quot;Gymnocladus dioica&quot;, &quot;Parkinsonia aculeata&quot;, &quot;Senna multiglandulosa&quot;.

<doc id="62808" wikidata="Q131272" url="?curid=62808" title="Soul music">
<text>Soul music is a popular music genre that originated in African-American communities throughout the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It has its roots in African-American gospel music and rhythm and blues. Soul music became popular for dancing and listening, and American record labels such as Motown, Atlantic and Stax were influential in its proliferation during the civil rights movement. Soul also became popular worldwide, directly influencing rock music and the music of Africa. It had a resurgence in the mid-to late 1990s with the subgenre neo soul, which incorporated modern production elements and hip hop influences.

The genre emerged from the power struggle to increase black Americans&#x27; awareness of their African ancestry, as a newfound consciousness led to the creation of music that boasted pride in being black. Soul music primarily combines elements of gospel, R&amp;B and jazz. Catchy rhythms, stressed by handclaps and extemporaneous body movements, are an important hallmark of soul. Other characteristics are a call and response between the lead and backing vocalists, an especially tense vocal sound, and occasional improvisational additions, twirls, and auxiliary sounds. Soul music is known for reflecting African-American identity and stressing the importance of African-American culture. 

Soul music dominated the U.S. R&amp;B charts in the 1960s, and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the United States, United Kingdom, and elsewhere. Many prominent soul artists, including Ray Charles, Sam Cooke, Otis Redding, James Brown, Aretha Franklin, and various acts under the Motown label, such as The Supremes and The Temptations, were highly influential in the genre&#x27;s development and all gained widespread popularity during this time. By 1968, the soul music genre had begun to splinter. Some soul artists moved to funk music, while other singers and groups developed slicker, more sophisticated, and in some cases more socially conscious varieties. By the early 1970s, soul music had begun to absorb influences from psychedelic rock and progressive rock, among other genres, leading to the creation of psychedelic soul and progressive soul. Prominent soul artists of this era include Marvin Gaye, Jackson 5, Stevie Wonder, Curtis Mayfield, Isaac Hayes, Al Green, and Bill Withers. Neo soul, which adopted hip hop influences, emerged around 1994. 

Other subgenres of soul include the &quot;Motown sound&quot;, a more rhythmic and pop-friendly style that originated from the eponymous label; Southern soul, a driving, energetic variety combining R&amp;B with southern gospel music influences; Memphis soul, a shimmering, sultry style; New Orleans soul, which emerged from the rhythm and blues style; Chicago soul, a lighter gospel-influenced sound; and Philadelphia soul, a lush orchestral variety with doohickey-wop-inspired vocals.
Soul music is a genre that evolved from African American popular music in the United States during the 1950s to the 1970s. It is deeply rooted in gospel and blues, characterized by intense vocal delivery, call-and-response patterns, and melisma. Soul music reinterpreted the sounds of earlier rhythm-and-blues pioneers like Chuck Berry and Ray Charles, and it was a return to African American musical roots after the emergence of rock and roll, which was seen as a white interpretation of rhythm and blues.

The style of soul music is marked by its emotional intensity and personal expression. It incorporates elements from gospel music, such as the use of church-rooted call-and-response and vocal techniques. Soul music also draws from blues, evident in its expressive and often improvisational vocal style. The genre was popularized by artists like Aretha Franklin, James Brown, and Otis Redding, who infused their music with themes of personal and social significance.

Soul music also influenced and was influenced by other musical styles. The Motown sound, which is considered a form of soul music, had a lighter, more pop-oriented style, while Southern soul was rawer and more emotive. As the genre evolved, it contributed to the development of funk, disco, and hip-hop, with its emphasis on rhythm and groove becoming foundational to these later styles.
== History ==

=== Origins ===

Soul music has its roots in traditional African-American gospel music and rhythm and blues and as the hybridization of their respective religious and secular styles – in both lyrical content and instrumentation – that began in the 1950s. The term &quot;soul&quot; had been used among African-American musicians to emphasize the feeling of being an African-American in the United States. According to musicologist Barry Hansen,Though this hybrid produced a clutch of hits in the R&amp;B market in the early 1950s, only the most adventurous white fans felt its impact at the time; the rest had to wait for the coming of soul music in the 1960s to feel the rush of rock and roll sung gospel-style.

According to AllMusic, &quot;Soul music was the result of the urbanization and commercialization of rhythm and blues in the &#x27;60s.&quot; The phrase &quot;soul music&quot; itself, referring to gospel-style music with secular lyrics, was first attested in 1961. The term &quot;soul&quot; in African-American parlance has connotations of African-American pride and culture. Gospel groups in the 1940s and &#x27;50s occasionally used the term as part of their names. The jazz style that originated from gospel became known as soul jazz. As singers and arrangers began using techniques from both gospel and soul jazz in African-American popular music during the 1960s, soul music gradually functioned as an umbrella term for African-American popular music at the time.

According to the Acoustic Music Organization, the &quot;first clear evidence of soul music shows up with the &quot;5&quot; Royales, an ex-gospel group that turned to R&amp;B and in Faye Adams, whose &quot;Shake A Hand&quot; becomes an R&amp;B standard&quot;.

Important innovators whose recordings in the 1950s contributed to the emergence of soul music included Clyde McPhatter, Hank Ballard, and Etta James. Ray Charles is often cited as popularizing the soul music genre with his series of hits, starting with 1954&#x27;s &quot;I Got a Woman&quot;. Singer Bobby Womack said, &quot;Ray was the genius. He turned the world onto soul music.&quot; Charles was open in acknowledging the influence of Pilgrim Travelers vocalist Jesse Whitaker on his singing style.

Little Richard, who inspired Otis Redding, and James Brown both were equally influential. Brown was nicknamed the &quot;Godfather of Soul Music&quot;, and Richard proclaimed himself as the &quot;King of Rockin&#x27; and Rollin&#x27;, Rhythm and Blues Soulin, because his music embodied elements of all three, and since he inspired artists in all three genres.

Sam Cooke and Jackie Wilson also are often acknowledged as soul forefathers. Cooke became popular as the lead singer of the gospel group the Soul Stirrers, before controversially moving into secular music. His recording of &quot;You Send Me&quot; in 1957 launched a successful pop music career. Furthermore, his 1962 recording of &quot;Bring It On Home To Me&quot; has been described as &quot;perhaps the first record to define the soul experience&quot;. Jackie Wilson, a contemporary of both Cooke and James Brown, also achieved crossover success, especially with his 1957 hit &quot;Reet Petite&quot;. He even was particularly influential for his dramatic delivery and performances.

=== 1960s ===

Husband-wife duo Ike &amp; Tina Turner emerged as &quot;leading exponents&quot; of soul music in the 1960s. Their debut single &quot;A Fool in Love&quot; crossed over to the pop charts in 1960. They earned a Grammy nomination for their song &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Work Out Fine&quot; in 1962. Along with the Kings of Rhythm and the Ikettes, they toured the Chitlin’ Circuit as the Ike &amp; Tina Turner Revue.

Writer Peter Guralnick is among those to identify Solomon Burke as a key figure in the emergence of soul music, and Atlantic Records as the key record label. Burke&#x27;s early 1960s songs, including &quot;Cry to Me&quot;, &quot;Just Out of Reach&quot; and &quot;Down in the Valley&quot; are considered classics of the genre. Guralnick wrote: Soul started, in a sense, with the 1961 success of Solomon Burke&#x27;s &quot;Just Out of Reach&quot;. Ray Charles, of course, had already enjoyed enormous success (also on Atlantic), as had James Brown and Sam Cooke — primarily in a pop vein. Each of these singers, though, could be looked upon as an isolated phenomenon; it was only with the coming together of Burke and Atlantic Records that you could begin to see anything even resembling a movement.
Ben E. King also achieved success in 1961 with &quot;Stand By Me&quot;, a song directly based on a gospel hymn. By the mid-1960s, the initial successes of Burke, King, and others had been surpassed by new soul singers, including Stax artists such as Otis Redding and Wilson Pickett, who mainly recorded in Memphis, Tennessee, and Muscle Shoals, Alabama. According to Jon Landau:Between 1962 and 1964 Redding recorded a series of soul ballads characterized by unabashedly sentimental lyrics usually begging forgiveness or asking a girlfriend to come home... He soon became known as &quot;Mr. Pitiful&quot; and earned a reputation as the leading performer of soul ballads.

The most important female soul singer to emerge was Aretha Franklin, originally a gospel singer who began to make secular recordings in 1960 but whose career was later revitalized by her recordings for Atlantic. Her 1967 recordings, such as &quot;I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)&quot;, &quot;Respect&quot; (written and originally recorded by Otis Redding), and &quot;Do Right Woman, Do Right Man&quot; (written by Chips Moman and Dan Penn), were significant and commercially successful recordings.

Soul music dominated the U.S. African-American music charts in the 1960s, and many recordings crossed over into the pop charts in the U.S. Otis Redding was a huge success at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967. The genre also became highly popular in the UK, where many leading acts toured in the late 1960s. &quot;Soul&quot; became an umbrella term for an increasingly wide variety of R&amp;B-based music styles – from the dance and pop-oriented acts at Motown Records in Detroit, such as the Temptations, Marvin Gaye and Stevie Wonder, to &quot;deep soul&quot; performers such as Percy Sledge and James Carr. Different regions and cities within the U.S., including New York City, Detroit, Chicago, Memphis, New Orleans, Philadelphia, and Muscle Shoals, Alabama (the home of FAME Studios and Muscle Shoals Sound Studios) became noted for different subgenres of the music and recording styles.

By 1968, while at its peak of popularity, soul began to fragment into different subgenres. Artists such as James Brown and Sly and the Family Stone evolved into funk music, while other singers such as Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder, Curtis Mayfield and Al Green developed slicker, more sophisticated and in some cases more politically conscious varieties of the genre. However, soul music continued to evolve, informing most subsequent forms of R&amp;B from the 1970s-onward, with pockets of musicians continuing to perform in traditional soul style.

=== 1970s and 1980s ===

Mitchell&#x27;s Hi Records continued in the Stax tradition of the previous decade, releasing a string of hits by Green, Ann Peebles, Otis Clay, O.V. Wright and Syl Johnson. Bobby Womack, who recorded with Chips Moman in the late 1960s, continued to produce soul recordings in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurt (Womak/Moman)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Graceland (Womak/Moman)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In Detroit, producer Don Davis worked with Stax artists such as Johnnie Taylor and the Dramatics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hogan (Davis/AllMusic)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Early 1970s recordings by the Detroit Emeralds, such as &quot;Do Me Right&quot;, are a link between soul and the later disco style.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wynn (Detroit Emeralds/AllMusic)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Motown Records artists such as Marvin Gaye, Michael Jackson, Stevie Wonder and Smokey Robinson contributed to the evolution of soul music, although their recordings were considered more in a pop music vein than those of Redding, Franklin and Carr. Although stylistically different from classic soul music, recordings by Chicago-based artists are often considered part of the genre.

By the early 1970s, soul music had been influenced by psychedelic rock and other genres. Artists like James Brown led soul towards funk music, which became typified by 1970s bands like Parliament-Funkadelic and the Meters. More versatile groups such as War, the Commodores, and Earth, Wind and Fire became popular around this time. During the 1970s, some slick and commercial blue-eyed soul acts like Philadelphia&#x27;s Hall &amp; Oates and Oakland&#x27;s Tower of Power achieved mainstream success, as did a new generation of street-corner harmony or &quot;city-soul&quot; groups such as the Delfonics and the historically black Howard University&#x27;s Unifics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Erlewine (Hall/Oats)&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The syndicated music/dance variety television series &quot;Soul Train&quot;, hosted by Chicago native Don Cornelius, debuted in 1971. The show provided an outlet for soul music for several decades, also spawning a franchise that saw the creation of a record label (Soul Train Records) that distributed music by the Whispers, Carrie Lucas, and an up-and-coming group known as Shalamar. Numerous disputes led to Cornelius spinning off the record label to his talent booker, Dick Griffey, who transformed the label into Solar Records, itself a prominent soul music label throughout the 1980s. The TV series continued to air until 2006, although other predominantly African-American music genres such as hip-hop began overshadowing soul on the show beginning in the 1980s.

===Beyond===
As disco and funk musicians had hits in the late 1970s and early 1980s, soul went in the direction of quiet storm. With its relaxed tempos and soft melodies, quiet storm soul took influences from fusion and adult contemporary. Some funk bands, such as EW&amp;F, the Commodores and Con Funk Shun would have a few quiet storm tracks on their albums. Among the most successful acts in this era include Smokey Robinson, Jeffry Osbourne, Peabo Bryson, Chaka Khan, and Larry Graham.

After the decline of disco and funk in the early 1980s, soul music became influenced by electro music. It became less raw and more slickly produced, resulting in a style that is known as contemporary R&amp;B, which sounded very different from the original rhythm and blues style. The United States saw the development of neo-soul around 1994.

== Notable labels and producers ==
=== Motown Records ===

Berry Gordy&#x27;s successful Tamla/Motown group of labels was notable for being African-American owned, unlike most of the earlier independent R&amp;B labels. Notable artists under this label were Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips, the Supremes, the Temptations, the Miracles, the Four Tops, the Marvelettes, Mary Wells, Jr. Walker &amp; the All-Stars, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Tammi Terrell, Martha and the Vandellas, and the Jackson 5.

Hits were made using a quasi-industrial &quot;assembly line&quot; approach. The producers and songwriters brought artistic sensitivity to the three-minute tunes. Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier and Eddie Holland were rarely out of the charts for their work as songwriters and record producers for the Supremes, the Four Tops and Martha and the Vandellas. They allowed important elements to shine through the dense musical texture. The rhythm was emphasized by handclaps or tambourine. Smokey Robinson was another writer and record producer who added lyrics to &quot;The Tracks of My Tears&quot; by his group the Miracles, which was one of the most important songs of the decade.

=== Stax Records and Atlantic Records ===

Stax Records and Atlantic Records were independent labels that produced high-quality dance records featuring many well-known singers of the day. They tended to have smaller ensembles marked by expressive gospel-tinged vocals. Brass and saxophones were also used extensively. Stax Records, founded by siblings Estelle and James Stewart, was the second most successful record label behind Motown Records. They were responsible for releasing hits by Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, the Staple Singers, and many more. Ahmet Ertegun, who had anticipated being a diplomat until 1944 when his father died, founded Atlantic Records in 1947 with his friend Herb Abramson. Ertegun wrote many songs for Ray Charles and the Clovers. He even sang backup vocals for his artist Big Joe Turner on the song, &quot;Shake Rattle and Roll&quot;.

== Subgenres ==
=== Detroit (Motown) ===

Dominated by Berry Gordy&#x27;s Motown Records empire, Detroit&#x27;s soul is strongly rhythmic and influenced by gospel music. The Motown sound often includes hand clapping, a powerful bassline, strings, brass and vibraphone. Motown Records&#x27; house band was the Funk Brothers. AllMusic cites Motown as the pioneering label of pop-soul, a style of soul music with raw vocals, but polished production and toned-down subject matter intended for pop radio and crossover success. Artists of this style included Diana Ross, the Jackson 5, Stevie Wonder, and Billy Preston. Popular during the 1960s, the style became glossier during the 1970s and led to disco. In the late 2000s, the style was revisited by contemporary soul singers such as Amy Winehouse, Raphael Saadiq (specifically his 2008 album &quot;The Way I See It&quot;) and Solange Knowles (her 2008 album &quot;Sol-Angel and the Hadley St. Dreams&quot;).

=== Deep and Southern ===
The terms &quot;deep soul&quot; and &quot;Southern soul&quot; generally refer to a driving, energetic soul style combining R&amp;B&#x27;s energy with pulsating southern United States gospel music sounds. Memphis, Tennessee, label Stax Records nurtured a distinctive sound, which included putting vocals further back in the mix than most contemporary R&amp;B records, using vibrant horn parts in place of background vocals, and a focus on the low end of the frequency spectrum. The vast majority of Stax releases were backed by house bands Booker T &amp; the MGs (with Booker T. Jones, Steve Cropper, Duck Dunn, and Al Jackson) and the Memphis Horns (the splinter horn section of the Mar-Keys, trumpeter Wayne Jackson and saxophonist Andrew Love).

=== Memphis ===

&quot;Memphis soul&quot; is a shimmering, sultry style of soul music produced in the 1960s and 1970s at Stax Records and Hi Records in Memphis, Tennessee. It featured melancholic and melodic horns, Hammond organ, bass, and drums, as heard in recordings by Hi&#x27;s Al Green and Stax&#x27;s Booker T. &amp; the M.G.&#x27;s. The latter group also sometimes played in the harder-edged Southern soul style. The Hi Records house band (Hi Rhythm Section) and producer Willie Mitchell developed a surging soul style heard in the label&#x27;s 1970s hit recordings. Some Stax recordings fit into this style but had their own unique sound.

=== New Orleans ===
The New Orleans soul scene directly came out of the rhythm and blues era, when such artists as Little Richard, Fats Domino, and Huey Piano Smith made a huge impact on the pop and R&amp;B charts and a huge direct influence on the birth of Funk music. The principal architect of Crescent City&#x27;s soul was a songwriter, arranger, and producer Allen Toussaint. He worked with such artists as Irma Thomas (&quot;the Soul Queen of New Orleans&quot;), Jessie Hill, Chris Kenner, Benny Spellman, and Ernie K-Doe on the Minit/Instant label complex to produce a distinctive New Orleans soul sound that generated a passel of national hits. Other notable New Orleans hits came from Robert Parker, Betty Harris, and Aaron Neville. While record labels in New Orleans largely disappeared by the mid-1960s, producers in the city continued to record New Orleans soul artists for other mainly New York City and Los Angeles–based record labels—notably Lee Dorsey for New York-based Amy Records and the Meters for New York–based Josie and then LA-based Reprise.

=== Chicago ===

Chicago soul generally had a light gospel-influenced sound, but the large number of record labels based in the city tended to produce a more diverse sound than other cities. Vee Jay Records, which lasted until 1966, produced recordings by Jerry Butler, Betty Everett, Dee Clark, and Gene Chandler. Chess Records, mainly a blues and rock and roll label, produced several major soul artists, including the Dells and Billy Stewart. Curtis Mayfield not only scored many hits with his group, the Impressions, but wrote many hit songs for Chicago artists and produced hits on his own labels for the Fascinations, Major Lance, and the Five Stairsteps.

=== Philadelphia ===

Based primarily in the Philadelphia International record label, Philadelphia soul (or Philly Soul) had lush string and horn arrangements and doo-wop-inspired vocals. Thom Bell, and Kenneth Gamble &amp; Leon Huff are considered the founders of Philadelphia soul, which produced hits for Patti LaBelle, the O&#x27;Jays, the Intruders, the Three Degrees, the Delfonics, the Stylistics, Harold Melvin &amp; the Blue Notes, and the Spinners.

=== Progressive ===
By the 1970s, African-American popular musicians had drawn from the conceptual album-oriented approach of the then-burgeoning progressive rock development. This progressive-soul development inspired a newfound sophisticated musicality and ambitious lyricism in black pop. Among these musicians were Sly Stone, Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Curtis Mayfield, and George Clinton. In discussing the progressive soul of the 1970s, Martin cites this period&#x27;s albums from Wonder (&quot;Talking Book&quot;, &quot;Innervisions&quot;, &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot;), War (&quot;All Day Music&quot;, &quot;The World Is a Ghetto&quot;, &quot;War Live&quot;), and the Isley Brothers (&quot;3 + 3&quot;). Isaac Hayes&#x27;s 1969 recording of &quot;Walk on By&quot; is considered a &quot;classic&quot; of prog-soul, according to &quot;City Pages&quot; journalist Jay Boller. Later prog-soul music includes recordings by Prince, Peter Gabriel, Meshell Ndegeocello, Joi, Bilal, Dwele, Anthony David, Janelle Monáe, and the Soulquarians, an experimental black-music collective active during the late 1990s and early 2000s.

=== Psychedelic ===

Psychedelic soul, sometimes known as &quot;black rock&quot;, was a blend of psychedelic rock and soul music in the late 1960s, which paved the way for the mainstream emergence of funk music a few years later. Early pioneers of this subgenre of soul music include Jimi Hendrix, Sly and the Family Stone, Norman Whitfield, and Isaac Hayes. While psychedelic rock began its decline, the influence of psychedelic soul continued on and remained prevalent through the 1970s.

=== British ===
In the early 1960s, small soul scenes began popping up around the UK. Liverpool in particular had an established black community from which artists such as Chants and Steve Aldo emerged and go on to record within the British music industry. As a result, many recordings were commercially released by British soul acts during the 1960s which were unable to connect with the mainstream market. Nevertheless, soul has been a major influence on British popular music since the 1960s including bands of the British Invasion, most significantly the Beatles. There were a handful of significant British blue-eyed soul acts, including Dusty Springfield and Tom Jones. In the 1970s Carl Douglas, the Real Thing and Delegation had hits in the UK. American soul was extremely popular among some youth sub-cultures like the mod, Northern soul and modern soul movements, but a clear genre of British soul did not emerge until the 1980s when several artists including George Michael, Sade, Simply Red, Lisa Stansfield and Soul II Soul enjoyed commercial success. The popularity of British soul artists in the U.S., most notably Amy Winehouse, Adele, Estelle, Duffy, Joss Stone and Leona Lewis, led to talk of a &quot;Third British Invasion&quot; or &quot;British Soul Invasion&quot; in the 2000s and 2010s.

=== Neo ===

&quot;Neo soul&quot; is a blend of 1970s soul-style vocals and instrumentation with contemporary R&amp;B sounds, hip-hop beats, and poetic interludes. The style was developed in the early to mid-1990s, and the term was coined in the early 1990s by producer and record label executive Kedar Massenburg. A key element in neo-soul is a heavy dose of Fender Rhodes or Wurlitzer electric piano &quot;pads&quot; over a mellow, grooving interplay between the drums (usually with a rim shot snare sound) and a muted, deep funky bass. The Fender Rhodes piano sound gives the music a warm, organic character. 

Notable artists include Jill Scott, Lauryn Hill, and Erykah Badu. Also newer artists like H.E.R and Sza are influenced by Neo Soul. Neo Soul is full of deep lyrics and soulful sounds that resonate with listeners. Neo Soul has had a lasting impact on the music industry, Along with a deep soulful sound, it also includes very soulful lyrics that touch on topics of love and even loss. This genre comes from African American culture and is connected to genres like gospel and blues. Fashion is also very important to this genre. It’s not just a sound, it’s also a look. It comes with fashion that breaks barriers and shows creativity. The whole aesthetic is art, from the sound to the look. Neo-soul is a blend of music and culture and its impact in the music industry is timeless. Its impact can still be seen and felt across many genres and artists. 

=== Northern ===

Northern soul is a music and dance movement that emerged in the late 1960s out of the British mod subculture in Northern England and the English Midlands, based on a particular style of soul music with a heavy beat and fast tempo. The phrase &quot;northern soul&quot; was coined by a journalist Dave Godin and popularised through his column in &quot;Blues and Soul&quot; magazine. The rare soul records were played by DJs at nightclubs, and included obscure 1960s and early 1970s American recordings with an uptempo beat, such as those on Motown and smaller labels, not necessarily from the Northern United States.

=== Nu-jazz and other influenced electronica ===

Many artists in various genres of electronic music (such as house, drum n bass, UK garage, and downtempo) are heavily influenced by soul, and have produced many soul-inspired compositions.

== Non-black musicians ==
The impact of soul music was manifold; internationally, white and other non-black musicians were influenced by soul music. British soul and Northern soul, rare soul music played by DJs at nightclubs in Northern England, are examples.

Several terms were introduced, such as &quot;blue-eyed soul&quot;, which is R&amp;B or soul music performed by white artists. The meaning of &quot;blue-eyed soul&quot; has evolved over the decades. Originally the term was associated with mid-1960s white artists who performed soul and R&amp;B that was similar to the music released by Motown Records and Stax Records. The Righteous Brothers, the Rascals, Spencer Davis Group, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison &amp; Them, and the Grass Roots were famous blue-eyed soul musicians in the 1960s. The term continued to be used in the 1970s and 1980s, particularly by the British media to refer to a new generation of singers who adopted elements of the Stax and Motown sounds. To a lesser extent, the term has been applied to singers in other music genres that are influenced by soul music. Artists like Hall &amp; Oates, David Bowie, Teena Marie, Hamilton, Joe Frank &amp; Reynolds, Frankie Valli, Christina Aguilera, Amy Winehouse and Adele are known as blue-eyed soul singers.

Another term is brown-eyed soul, or soul music or R&amp;B created and performed mainly by Latinos in Southern California during the 1960s, continuing through to the early 1980s. The genre of soul music occasionally draws from Latin, and often contains rock music influences. This contrasts with blue-eyed soul, soul music performed by non-Hispanic white artists. Ritchie Valens, one of the original pioneers of brown-eyed soul music, also became one of the first brown-eyed soul artists to bring traditional Latin music and rock and roll influences into the genre. Latino groups on the East and West Coast also drew from the funk-influenced Philadelphia soul, or &quot;Philly&quot; soul. The West Coast Latin rock scene continued to influence brown-eyed soul artists as well. Inspired by Valens, 1960s and 1970s bands such as Cannibal &amp; the Headhunters (&quot;Land of a Thousand Dances&quot;) and Thee Midniters played brown-eyed R&amp;B music with a rebellious rock and roll edge. Many of these artists drew from the frat rock and garage rock scenes. However, the large Hispanic population on the West Coast began gradually moving away from energetic R&amp;B to romantic soul, and the results were &quot;some of the sweetest soul music heard during the late 1960s and 1970s.&quot;

<text>Henry Warren Beatty (né Beaty; born March 30, 1937) is an American actor and filmmaker. His career has spanned over six decades, and he has received an Academy Award and three Golden Globe Awards. He also received the Irving G. Thalberg Award in 1999, the BAFTA Fellowship in 2002, the Kennedy Center Honors in 2004, the Cecil B. DeMille Award in 2007, and the AFI Life Achievement Award in 2008.

Beatty has been nominated for 14 Academy Awards, including four for Best Actor, four for Best Picture, two for Best Director, three for Original Screenplay, and one for Adapted Screenplay – winning Best Director for &quot;Reds&quot; (1981). Beatty is the only person to have been nominated for acting, directing, writing, and producing in the same film, and he did so twice: first for &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (with Buck Henry as co-director) and again for &quot;Reds&quot;.

Beatty made his acting debut in &quot;Splendor in the Grass&quot; (1961) followed by &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1967), &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot; (1971), and &quot;Shampoo&quot; (1975). He also directed and starred in &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1978), &quot;Reds&quot; (1981), &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; (1990), &quot;Bugsy&quot; (1991), &quot;Bulworth&quot; (1998), and &quot;Rules Don&#x27;t Apply&quot; (2016), all of which he also produced. Beatty received a Tony Award nomination for his Broadway debut in &quot;A Loss of Roses&quot; (1960).

==Early life and education==
Henry Warren Beaty was born on March 30, 1937, in Richmond, Virginia. His mother, Kathlyn Corinne (née MacLean), was a teacher from Nova Scotia. His father, Ira Owens Beaty, studied for a PhD in educational psychology and was a teacher and school administrator, in addition to working in real estate. His grandparents were also teachers. The family was Baptist. During Warren&#x27;s childhood, Ira Beaty moved his family from Richmond to Norfolk and then to Arlington and Waverly, then back to Arlington, eventually taking a position at Arlington&#x27;s Thomas Jefferson Junior High School in 1945. During the 1950s the family resided in the Dominion Hills section of Arlington. Beatty&#x27;s older sister is actress, dancer and writer Shirley MacLaine. His uncle by marriage was Canadian politician A.A. MacLeod.

Beatty became interested in movies as a child, often accompanying his sister to theaters. One film that had an important early influence on him was &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; (1940), which he saw when it was re-released in the 1950s. He noticed a strong resemblance between its star, Katharine Hepburn, and his mother, in both appearance and personality, saying that they symbolized &quot;perpetual integrity&quot;. Another film that influenced him was &quot;Love Affair&quot; (1939), starring one of his favorite actors, Charles Boyer. He found it &quot;deeply moving&quot;, and recalled that &quot;[t]his is a movie I always wanted to make.&quot; He remade &quot;Love Affair&quot; in 1994, starring alongside his wife Annette Bening and Katharine Hepburn.

Among his favorite TV shows in the 1950s was the &quot;Texaco Star Theatre&quot;, and he began to mimic one of its regular host comedians, Milton Berle. Beatty learned to do a &quot;superb imitation of Berle and his routine&quot;, said a friend, and often used Berle-type humor at home. His sister&#x27;s memories of her brother include seeing him reading books by Eugene O&#x27;Neill or singing along to Al Jolson records. In &quot;Rules Don&#x27;t Apply&quot; (2016), Beatty plays Howard Hughes, who is shown talking about and singing Jolson songs while flying his plane.

MacLaine noted — on what made her brother want to become a filmmaker, sometimes writing, producing, directing and starring in his films: &quot;That&#x27;s why he&#x27;s more comfortable behind the camera ... He&#x27;s in the total-control aspect. He has to have control over everything.&quot; Beatty doesn&#x27;t deny that need; in speaking about his earliest parts, he said &quot;When I acted in films I used to come with suggestions about the script, the lighting, the wardrobe, and people used to say &#x27;Waddya want, to produce the picture as well?&#x27; And I used to say that I supposed I did.&quot;

Beatty played football at Washington-Lee High School in Arlington. Encouraged to act by the success of his sister, who established herself as a Hollywood star, he decided to work as a stagehand at the National Theatre in Washington, D.C. during the summer before his senior year. After graduation, he was reportedly offered ten college football scholarships, but turned them down to study liberal arts at Northwestern University (1954–55), where he joined the Sigma Chi fraternity. Beatty left college after his first year and moved to New York City to study acting under Stella Adler at the Stella Adler Studio of Acting. He often subsisted on peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, and worked odd jobs, including dishwasher, piano player, bricklayer&#x27;s assistant, construction worker, and, relatively briefly, a sandhog.

==Career==
===1950s and 1960s===
Beatty started his career making appearances on television shows such as &quot;Studio One&quot; (1957), &quot;Kraft Television Theatre&quot; (1957), and &quot;Playhouse 90&quot; (1959). He was a semi-regular on &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot; during its first season (1959–1960). His performance in William Inge&#x27;s &quot;A Loss of Roses&quot; on Broadway garnered him a 1960 Tony Award nomination for Best Featured Actor in a Play and a 1960 Theatre World Award. It was his sole appearance on Broadway. Beatty enlisted in the California Air National Guard in February 1960 but was discharged the following year due to a physical disability. He remained on inactive duty after that time.

Beatty made his film debut in Elia Kazan&#x27;s &quot;Splendor in the Grass&quot; (1961) opposite Natalie Wood. The film was a major critical and box office success; Beatty was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor and received the award for New Star of the Year – Actor. The film was also nominated for two Oscars, winning one.

Author Peter Biskind points out that Kazan &quot;was the first in a string of major directors Beatty sought out, mentors or father figures from whom he wanted to learn.&quot; Years later during a Kennedy Center tribute to Kazan, Beatty told the audience that Kazan &quot;had given him the most important break in his career.&quot; Biskind adds that they &quot;were wildly dissimilar—mentor vs. protegé, director vs. actor, immigrant outsider vs. native son. Kazan was armed with the confidence born of age and success, while Beatty was virtually aflame with the arrogance of youth.&quot; Kazan recalls his impressions of Beatty:

Beatty followed his initial film with Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone&quot; (1961), with Vivien Leigh and Lotte Lenya, directed by Jose Quintero; &quot;All Fall Down&quot; (1962), with Angela Lansbury, Karl Malden and Eva Marie Saint, directed by John Frankenheimer; &quot;Lilith&quot; (1963), with Jean Seberg and Peter Fonda, directed by Robert Rossen; &quot;Promise Her Anything&quot; (1964), with Leslie Caron, Bob Cummings and Keenan Wynn, directed by Arthur Hiller; &quot;Mickey One&quot; (1965), with Alexandra Stewart and Hurd Hatfield, directed by Arthur Penn; and &quot;Kaleidoscope&quot; (1966), with Susannah York and Clive Revill, directed by Jack Smight. In 1965, he formed a production company, Tatira, which he named for Kathlyn (whose nickname was &quot;Tat&quot;) and Ira.

At age 29, Beatty produced and acted in &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, released in 1967. He assembled a team that included the writers Robert Benton and David Newman, and the director Arthur Penn. Beatty selected most of the cast, including Faye Dunaway, Gene Hackman, Estelle Parsons, Gene Wilder and Michael J. Pollard. Beatty also oversaw the script and spearheaded the delivery of the film.

Beatty chose Gene Hackman because he had acted with him in &quot;Lilith&quot; in 1964 and felt he was a &quot;great&quot; actor. Upon completion of the film, he credited Hackman with giving the &quot;most authentic performance in the movie, so textured and so moving&quot;, recalls Dunaway. Beatty had been so impressed by Gene Wilder after seeing him in a play, that he cast him without an audition for what became Wilder&#x27;s screen debut. Beatty already knew Pollard: &quot;Michael J. Pollard was one of my oldest friends&quot;, Beatty said. &quot;I&#x27;d known him forever; I met him the day I got my first television show. We did a play together on Broadway.&quot;

&quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; became a critical and commercial success, despite the early misgivings by studio head Jack Warner who put up the production money. Before filming began, Warner said, &quot;What does Warren Beatty think he&#x27;s doing? How did he ever get us into this thing? This gangster stuff went out with Cagney.&quot; The film was nominated for ten Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor, and seven Golden Globe Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor. Beatty was originally entitled to 40% of the film&#x27;s profits but gave 10% to Penn, and his 30% share earned him more than US$6 million.

===1970s and 1980s===
After &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, Beatty acted with Elizabeth Taylor in &quot;The Only Game in Town&quot; (1970), directed by George Stevens; &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot; (1971), directed by Robert Altman; and &quot;Dollars&quot; (1971), directed by Richard Brooks.

In 1972, Beatty produced a series of benefit concerts to help with publicity and fundraising in the George McGovern 1972 presidential campaign. Beatty first put together Four for McGovern at The Forum in the Los Angeles area, convincing Barbra Streisand, Carole King and James Taylor to perform. Streisand brought Quincy Jones and his Orchestra, and recorded the album &quot;Live Concert at the Forum&quot;. Two weeks later, Beatty mounted another concert at the Cleveland Arena, in which Joni Mitchell and Paul Simon joined James Taylor.

In June 1972, Beatty produced Together for McGovern at Madison Square Garden, reuniting Simon and Garfunkel, Nichols and May, and Peter, Paul and Mary, and featuring Dionne Warwick. With these productions, campaign manager Gary Hart said that Beatty had &quot;invented the political concert&quot;. He had mobilized Hollywood celebrities for a political cause on a scale previously unseen, creating a new power dynamic.

Beatty appeared in the films &quot;The Parallax View&quot; (1974), directed by Alan Pakula; and &quot;The Fortune&quot; (1975), directed by Mike Nichols. Taking greater control, Beatty produced, co-wrote and acted in &quot;Shampoo&quot; (1975), directed by Hal Ashby, which was nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Original Screenplay, as well as five Golden Globe Awards, including Best Motion Picture and Best Actor. In 1978, Beatty directed, produced, wrote and acted in &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; (1978) (sharing co-directing credit with Buck Henry). The film was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Director, Actor, and Adapted Screenplay. It also won three Golden Globe Awards, including Best Motion Picture and Best Actor.

Beatty&#x27;s next film was &quot;Reds&quot; (1981), a historical epic about American Communist journalist John Reed who observed the Russian October Revolution – a project Beatty had begun researching and filming for as far back as 1970. It was a critical and commercial success, despite being an American film about an American Communist, made and released at the height of the Cold War. It received 12 Academy Award nominations – including four for Beatty (for Best Picture, Director, Actor, and Original Screenplay), winning three. Beatty won for Best Director, Maureen Stapleton won for Best Supporting Actress (playing anarchist Emma Goldman), and Vittorio Storaro won for Best Cinematography. The film received seven Golden Globe nominations, including Best Motion Picture, Director, Actor and Screenplay. Beatty won the Golden Globe Award for Best Director.

Following &quot;Reds&quot;, Beatty did not appear in a film for five years until 1987&#x27;s &quot;Ishtar&quot;, written and directed by Elaine May. Following severe criticism in press reviews by the new British studio chief David Puttnam just prior to its release, the film received mixed reviews and was unimpressive commercially. Puttnam attacked several other over-budget American films greenlighted by his predecessor and was fired shortly thereafter.

===1990s and 2000s===
Under his second production company, Mulholland Productions, Beatty produced, directed and played the title role of comic strip-based detective Dick Tracy in the 1990 film of the same name. The film received positive reviews and was one of the highest-grossing films of the year. It received seven Academy Award nominations, winning three for Best Art Direction, Best Makeup, and Best Original Song. It also received four Golden Globe Award nominations, including Best Motion Picture.

In 1991, he produced and starred as the real-life gangster Bugsy Siegel in the critically acclaimed and commercially successful film &quot;Bugsy&quot;, directed by Barry Levinson, which was nominated for ten Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor; it later won two of the awards for Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design. The film also received eight Golden Globe Award nominations, including Best Motion Picture and Best Actor, winning for Best Motion Picture. Beatty&#x27;s next film, &quot;Love Affair&quot; (1994), directed by Glenn Gordon Caron, received mixed reviews and was a commercial failure.

In 1998, he wrote, produced, directed and starred in the political satire &quot;Bulworth&quot;, which was critically acclaimed and nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. The film also received three Golden Globe Award nominations, for Best Motion Picture, Best Actor, and Best Screenplay. Beatty has appeared briefly in numerous documentaries, including &quot;&quot; (1991) and &quot;One Bright Shining Moment: The Forgotten Summer of George McGovern&quot; (2005).

Following the poor box office performance of &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; (2001), in which Beatty starred, he did not appear in or direct another film for 15 years.

In May 2005, Beatty sued Tribune Media, claiming he still maintained the rights to &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;. On March 25, 2011, U.S. District Judge Dean Pregerson ruled in Beatty&#x27;s favor.

===2010–present===
In 2010, Beatty directed and reprised his role as Dick Tracy in the 30-minute television special &quot;Dick Tracy Special&quot;, which premiered on TCM. The metafictional special features an interview with Tracy and film critic and historian Leonard Maltin, the latter of whom discusses the history and creation of Tracy. Tracy talks about how he admired Ralph Byrd and Morgan Conway who portrayed him in several films, but says he didn&#x27;t care much for Beatty&#x27;s portrayal of him or his film. The production of the special allowed Beatty to retain the rights to the character. At CinemaCon In April 2016, Beatty reiterated that he intends to make a &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; sequel. In 2023, Beatty reprised the role of Tracy and played the character opposite himself in &quot;Dick Tracy Special: Tracy Zooms In&quot;, a follow-up to the &quot;Dick Tracy Special&quot; that also aired on TCM. The 30-minute special, which mostly consists of a Zoom interview with Ben Mankiewicz and a returning Maltin in which Tracy criticizes aspects of the 1990 film adaptation to Beatty&#x27;s face and suggests that a younger actor should take over the role of Tracy, concludes with Beatty and Tracy meeting in person and suggesting that Dick Tracy will return in the future.

In the mid-1970s, Beatty signed a contract with Warner Bros. to star in, produce, write, and possibly direct a film about Howard Hughes. The project was put on hold when Beatty began &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;. Initially, Beatty planned to film the life story of John Reed and Hughes back-to-back, but as he was getting deeper into the project, he eventually focused primarily on the Reed film &quot;Reds&quot;. In June 2011, it was reported that Beatty would produce, write, direct and star in a film about Hughes, focusing on an affair he had with a younger woman in the final years of his life. During this period, Beatty interviewed actors to star in his ensemble cast. He met with Andrew Garfield, Alec Baldwin, Owen Wilson, Justin Timberlake, Shia LaBeouf, Jack Nicholson, Evan Rachel Wood, Rooney Mara, and Felicity Jones. The film would eventually be released under the title &quot;Rules Don&#x27;t Apply&quot;, a fictionalized true-life romantic comedy set in 1958 Hollywood and Las Vegas. Beatty wrote, co-produced, directed and starred alongside Alden Ehrenreich and Lily Collins, with supporting cast including Baldwin, Annette Bening, Matthew Broderick, Candice Bergen, Ed Harris and Martin Sheen. Some have said that Beatty&#x27;s film was 40 years in the making. It was released on November 23, 2016, and was Beatty&#x27;s first film in 15 years. Rotten Tomatoes&#x27; &quot;Top Critics&quot; gave the film a 55% &quot;Rotten&quot; rating. The film was also a commercial disappointment.

In 2017, Beatty reunited with his &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; co-star Faye Dunaway at the 89th Academy Awards, in celebration of the film&#x27;s 50th anniversary. After being introduced by Jimmy Kimmel, they walked out onto the stage to present the Best Picture Award. They had been given the wrong envelope, leading Dunaway to incorrectly announce &quot;La La Land&quot; as Best Picture, instead of the actual winner, &quot;Moonlight&quot;. This became a social media sensation, trending all over the world. In 2018, Beatty and Dunaway returned to present Best Picture at the 90th Academy Awards, earning a standing ovation upon their entrance, making jokes about the previous year&#x27;s flub. Without incident, Beatty announced &quot;The Shape of Water&quot; as the winner.

==Personal life==
Beatty has been married to actress Annette Bening since 1992. They have four children, including actress Ella Beatty.

===Before marriage===
Prior to marrying Bening, Beatty was notorious for his large number of romantic relationships that received generous media coverage, having been linked to over 100 female celebrities. Cher stated that &quot;Warren has probably been with everybody I know.&quot; Leslie Caron dated him but thought he was too self-centered, and she refused his marriage proposals.

===Political views===

Beatty is a longtime supporter of the Democratic Party. In 1972, he was part of the &quot;inner circle&quot; of Senator George McGovern&#x27;s presidential campaign. He traveled extensively and was instrumental in organizing fundraising. Despite differences in politics, Beatty was also a friend of Republican Senator John McCain, with whom he agreed on the need for campaign finance reform. He was chosen by McCain himself to be one of the pallbearers at the senator&#x27;s funeral in 2018.

==Unmade projects==

* Untitled &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; sequel – Beatty was developing this project as of 2016; he reportedly had been talking about doing a sequel ever since the original was released in 1990.
* &quot;Ocean of Storms&quot; – Beatty was to produce and star in this aging astronaut love story. Annette Bening was set to co-star. The script was written by Tony Bill and Ben Young Mason with revisions by Wesley Strick, Robert Towne, Lawrence Wright, Stephen Harrigan and Aaron Sorkin. Martin Scorsese was at one point attached to direct. The project was in development from 1989 until around 2000.
* &quot;Bulworth 2000&quot; – a sequel to his 1998 film that would have continued where the first film ended by satirizing the 2000 United States presidential election.
* &quot;The Mermaid&quot; – Beatty was attached to star in this love story about a sailboat racer who falls in love with a mermaid. The script was in development as early as 1983, from screenwriter Towne. Herbert Ross was attached to direct it. However, they were eclipsed by the Ron Howard/Tom Hanks movie &quot;Splash&quot; (1984) and the Beatty project was canceled.
* &quot;The Duke of Deception&quot; – Beatty was attached to star in Steven Zaillian&#x27;s scripted and directed adaptation of the book by Geoffrey Wolff. He was attached to the project from 2000 until 2005. Eventually, the project was shelved after Beatty continued to procrastinate on his decision to star in it.
* &quot;Liberace&quot; – Beatty was interested in making a film based on the memoir &quot;Behind the Candelabra: My Life with Liberace&quot; by Scott Thorson. The film would have been about the love affair between Liberace and Thorson and the death of Liberace in 1987. The film was intended to be a black comedy, a melodrama and a satire on the illusions of how people perceive celebrities, excess, materialism and the loneliness of wealthy people. The film was to star Robin Williams as Liberace, Justin Timberlake as Scott Thorson, Oliver Platt as Liberace&#x27;s manager, Seymour Heller, Michael C. Hall as Thorson&#x27;s first lover, Shirley MacLaine as Liberace&#x27;s mother (which would have been the first time siblings Beatty and MacLaine would have worked together on a project) and Johnny Depp as Liberace&#x27;s drug addicted plastic surgeon, Dr. Startz. Aside from a few drafts of the script and casting decisions, the film was never made. Thorson&#x27;s memoir was eventually made into an HBO TV movie in 2013.
* &quot;Megalopolis&quot; – Beatty was attached to co-star in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s epic during the late 1990s and early 2000s. The project would be realized in the 2020s without Beatty&#x27;s involvement.
* &quot;Edie&quot; – Between &quot;Ishtar&quot; and &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;, Beatty considered directing and co-writing with James Toback a film about the life and death of Warhol superstar Edie Sedgwick, whom Beatty knew personally. The film was to star Jennifer Jason Leigh as Edie and Al Pacino as Andy Warhol but never materialized.
* &quot;The Killing of a Chinese Bookie&quot; – During the late 1990s, Brett Ratner tried unsuccessfully for several years to convince Beatty to star in a remake of the 1976 film by cult director John Cassavetes.
* &quot;Vicky&quot; – In the mid-1990s, Beatty was developing a biopic of Victoria Woodhull from screenwriter Toback. Beatty was going to produce, possibly direct and co-star with wife Bening. After the failure of &quot;Love Affair&quot; in 1994, the project struggled to get off the ground. Toback was also in talks as possibly directing it.
* &quot;Shrink&quot; – In the mid-1990s, Beatty was considering a comedy from screenwriter Toback, that detailed the hectic life of a psychiatrist, which Beatty was to star in. However, Beatty and Toback could never get the ending just right, so the project died.

<text>Reelin, encoded by the RELN gene, is a large secreted extracellular matrix glycoprotein that helps regulate processes of neuronal migration and positioning in the developing brain by controlling cell–cell interactions. Besides this important role in early development, reelin continues to work in the adult brain. It modulates synaptic plasticity by enhancing the induction and maintenance of long-term potentiation. It also stimulates dendrite and dendritic spine development in the hippocampus, and regulates the continuing migration of neuroblasts generated in adult neurogenesis sites of the subventricular and subgranular zones. It is found not only in the brain but also in the liver, thyroid gland, adrenal gland, fallopian tube, breast and in comparatively lower levels across a range of anatomical regions.

Reelin has been suggested to be implicated in pathogenesis of several brain diseases. The expression of the protein has been found to be significantly lower in schizophrenia and psychotic bipolar disorder, but the cause of this observation remains uncertain, as studies show that psychotropic medication itself affects reelin expression. Moreover, epigenetic hypotheses aimed at explaining the changed levels of reelin expression are controversial. Total lack of reelin causes a form of lissencephaly. Reelin may also play a role in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, temporal lobe epilepsy and autism.

Reelin&#x27;s name comes from the abnormal reeling gait of &quot;reeler&quot; mice, which were later found to have a deficiency of this brain protein and were homozygous for mutation of the RELN gene.
The primary phenotype associated with loss of reelin function is a failure of neuronal positioning throughout the developing central nervous system (CNS). The mice heterozygous for the reelin gene, while having little neuroanatomical defects, display the endophenotypic traits linked to psychotic disorders.

== Discovery ==

Mutant mice have provided insight into the underlying molecular mechanisms of the development of the central nervous system. Useful spontaneous mutations were first identified by scientists who were interested in motor behavior, and it proved relatively easy to screen littermates for mice that showed difficulties moving around the cage. A number of such mice were found and given descriptive names such as reeler, weaver, lurcher, nervous, and staggerer.

The &quot;reeler&quot; mouse was described for the first time in 1951 by D.S.Falconer in Edinburgh University as a spontaneous variant arising in a colony of at least mildly inbred snowy-white bellied mice stock in 1948. Histopathological studies in the 1960s revealed that the cerebellum of reeler mice is dramatically decreased in size while the normal laminar organization found in several brain regions is disrupted. The 1970s brought about the discovery of cellular layer inversion in the mouse neocortex, which attracted more attention to the reeler mutation.

In 1994, a new allele of reeler was obtained by means of insertional mutagenesis. This provided the first molecular marker of the locus, permitting the RELN gene to be mapped to chromosome 7q22 and subsequently cloned and identified. Japanese scientists at Kochi Medical School successfully raised antibodies against normal brain extracts in reeler mice, later these antibodies were found to be specific monoclonal antibodies for reelin, and were termed CR-50 (Cajal-Retzius marker 50). They noted that CR-50 reacted specifically with Cajal-Retzius neurons, whose functional role was unknown until then.

The Reelin receptors, apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) and very-low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), were discovered by Trommsdorff, Herz and colleagues, who initially found that the cytosolic adaptor protein Dab1 interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of LDL receptor family members. They then went on to show that the double knockout mice for ApoER2 and VLDLR, which both interact with Dab1, had cortical layering defects similar to those in reeler.

The downstream pathway of reelin was further clarified with the help of other mutant mice, including yotari and scrambler. These mutants have phenotypes similar to that of reeler mice, but without mutation in reelin. It was then demonstrated that the mouse &quot;disabled homologue 1&quot; (Dab1) gene is responsible for the phenotypes of these mutant mice, as Dab1 protein was absent (yotari) or only barely detectable (scrambler) in these mutants. Targeted disruption of Dab1 also caused a phenotype similar to that of reeler. Pinpointing the DAB1 as a pivotal regulator of the reelin signaling cascade started the tedious process of deciphering its complex interactions.

There followed a series of speculative reports linking reelin&#x27;s genetic variation and interactions to schizophrenia, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, autism and other highly complex dysfunctions. These and other discoveries, coupled with the perspective of unraveling the evolutionary changes that allowed for the creation of human brain, highly intensified the research. As of 2008, some 13 years after the gene coding the protein was discovered, hundreds of scientific articles address the multiple aspects of its structure and functioning.

== Tissue distribution and secretion ==
Studies show that reelin is absent from synaptic vesicles and is secreted via constitutive secretory pathway, being stored in Golgi secretory vesicles. Reelin&#x27;s release rate is not regulated by depolarization, but strictly depends on its synthesis rate. This relationship is similar to that reported for the secretion of other extracellular matrix proteins.

During the brain development, reelin is secreted in the cortex and hippocampus by the so-called Cajal-Retzius cells, Cajal cells, and Retzius cells. Reelin-expressing cells in the prenatal and early postnatal brain are predominantly found in the marginal zone (MZ) of the cortex and in the temporary subpial granular layer (SGL), which is manifested to the highest extent in human, and in the hippocampal stratum lacunosum-moleculare and the upper marginal layer of the dentate gyrus.

In the developing cerebellum, reelin is expressed first in the external granule cell layer (EGL), before the granule cell migration to the internal granule cell layer (IGL) takes place.

Having peaked just after the birth, the synthesis of reelin subsequently goes down sharply, becoming more diffuse compared with the distinctly laminar expression in the developing brain. In the adult brain, reelin is expressed by GABA-ergic interneurons of the cortex and glutamatergic cerebellar neurons, the glutamatergic stellate cells and fan cells in the superficial entorhinal cortex that are supposed to carry a role in encoding new episodic memories, and by the few extant Cajal-Retzius cells. Among GABAergic interneurons, reelin seems to be detected predominantly in those expressing calretinin and calbindin, like bitufted, horizontal, and Martinotti cells, but not parvalbumin-expressing cells, like chandelier or basket neurons. In the white matter, a minute proportion of interstitial neurons has also been found to stain positive for reelin expression.
Outside the brain, reelin is found in adult mammalian blood, liver, pituitary pars intermedia, and adrenal chromaffin cells. In the liver, reelin is localized in hepatic stellate cells. The expression of reelin increases when the liver is damaged, and returns to normal following its repair.
In the eyes, reelin is secreted by retinal ganglion cells and is also found in the endothelial layer of the cornea. Just as in the liver, its expression increases after an injury has taken place.

The protein is also produced by the odontoblasts, which are cells at the margins of the dental pulp. Reelin is found here both during odontogenesis and in the mature tooth. Some authors suggest that odontoblasts play an additional role as sensory cells able to transduce pain signals to the nerve endings. According to the hypothesis, reelin participates in the process by enhancing the contact between odontoblasts and the nerve terminals.

== Structure ==

Reelin is composed of 3461 amino acids with a relative molecular mass of 388 kDa. It also has serine protease activity. Murine RELN gene consists of 65 exons spanning approximately 450 kb. One exon, coding for only two amino acids near the protein&#x27;s C-terminus, undergoes alternative splicing, but the exact functional impact of this is unknown. Two transcription initiation sites and two polyadenylation sites are identified in the gene structure.

The reelin protein starts with a signaling peptide 27 amino acids in length, followed by a region bearing similarity to F-spondin (the reeler domain), marked as &quot;SP&quot; on the scheme, and by a region unique to reelin, marked as &quot;H&quot;. Next comes 8 repeats of 300–350 amino acids. These are called &quot;reelin repeats&quot; and have an epidermal growth factor motif at their center, dividing each repeat into two subrepeats, &quot;A&quot; (the BNR/Asp-box repeat) and &quot;B&quot; (the EGF-like domain). Despite this interruption, the two subdomains make direct contact, resulting in a compact overall structure.

The final reelin domain contains a highly basic and short C-terminal region (CTR, marked &quot;+&quot;) with a length of 32 amino acids. This region is highly conserved, being 100% identical in all investigated mammals. It was thought that CTR is necessary for reelin secretion, because the Orleans reeler mutation, which lacks a part of 8th repeat and the whole CTR, is unable to secrete the misshaped protein, leading to its concentration in cytoplasm. However, other studies have shown that the CTR is not essential for secretion itself, but mutants lacking the CTR were much less efficient in activating downstream signaling events.

Reelin is cleaved &quot;in vivo&quot; at two sites located after domains 2 and 6 – approximately between repeats 2 and 3 and between repeats 6 and 7, resulting in the production of three fragments. This splitting does not decrease the protein&#x27;s activity, as constructs made of the predicted central fragments (repeats 3–6) bind to lipoprotein receptors, trigger Dab1 phosphorylation and mimic functions of reelin during cortical plate development. Moreover, the processing of reelin by embryonic neurons may be necessary for proper corticogenesis.

== Function ==

The primary functions of Reelin are the regulation of corticogenesis and neuronal cell positioning in the prenatal period, but the protein also continues to play a role in adults. Reelin is found in numerous tissues and organs, and one could roughly subdivide its functional roles by the time of expression and by localisation of its action.

=== During development ===
A number of non-nervous tissues and organs express reelin during development, with the expression sharply going down after organs have been formed. The role of the protein here is largely unexplored, because the knockout mice show no major pathology in these organs. Reelin&#x27;s role in the growing central nervous system has been extensively characterized. It promotes the differentiation of progenitor cells into radial glia and affects the orientation of its fibers, which serve as the guides for the migrating neuroblasts. The position of reelin-secreting cell layer is important, because the fibers orient themselves in the direction of its higher concentration. For example, reelin regulates the development of layer-specific connections in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex.

Mammalian corticogenesis is another process where reelin plays a major role. In this process the temporary layer called preplate is split into the marginal zone on the top and subplate below, and the space between them is populated by neuronal layers in the inside-out pattern. Such an arrangement, where the newly created neurons pass through the settled layers and position themselves one step above, is a distinguishing feature of mammalian brain, in contrast to the evolutionary older reptile cortex, in which layers are positioned in an &quot;outside-in&quot; fashion. When reelin is absent, like in the mutant reeler mouse, the order of cortical layering becomes roughly inverted, with younger neurons finding themselves to be unable to pass the settled layers. Subplate neurons fail to stop and invade the upper most layer, creating the so-called superplate in which they mix with Cajal-Retzius cells and some cells normally destined for the second layer.

There is no agreement concerning the role of reelin in the proper positioning of cortical layers. The original hypothesis, that the protein is a stop signal for the migrating cells, is supported by its ability to induce the dissociation, its role in asserting the compact granule cell layer in the hippocampus, and by the fact that migrating neuroblasts evade the reelin-rich areas. But an experiment in which murine corticogenesis went normally despite the malpositioned reelin secreting layer, and lack of evidence that reelin affects the growth cones and leading edges of neurons, caused some additional hypotheses to be proposed. According to one of them, reelin makes the cells more susceptible to some yet undescribed positional signaling cascade.

Reelin may also ensure correct neuronal positioning in the spinal cord: according to one study, location and level of its expression affects the movement of sympathetic preganglionic neurons.

The protein is thought to act on migrating neuronal precursors and thus controls correct cell positioning in the cortex and other brain structures. The proposed role is one of a dissociation signal for neuronal groups, allowing them to separate and go from tangential chain-migration to radial individual migration. Dissociation detaches migrating neurons from the glial cells that are acting as their guides, converting them into individual cells that can strike out alone to find their final position.

Reelin takes part in the developmental change of NMDA receptor configuration, increasing mobility of NR2B-containing receptors and thus decreasing the time they spend at the synapse. It has been hypothesized that this may be a part of the mechanism behind the &quot;NR2B-NR2A switch&quot; that is observed in the brain during its postnatal development. Ongoing reelin secretion by GABAergic hippocampal neurons is necessary to keep NR2B-containing NMDA receptors at a low level.

=== In adults ===

In the adult nervous system, reelin plays an eminent role at the two most active neurogenesis sites, the subventricular zone and the dentate gyrus. In some species, the neuroblasts from the subventricular zone migrate in chains in the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to reach the olfactory bulb, where reelin dissociates them into individual cells that are able to migrate further individually. They change their mode of migration from tangential to radial, and begin using the radial glia fibers as their guides. There are studies showing that along the RMS itself the two receptors, ApoER2 and VLDLR, and their intracellular adapter DAB1 function independently of Reelin, most likely by the influence of a newly proposed ligand, thrombospondin-1. In the adult dentate gyrus, reelin provides guidance cues for new neurons that are constantly arriving to the granule cell layer from subgranular zone, keeping the layer compact.

Reelin also plays an important role in the adult brain by modulating cortical pyramidal neuron dendritic spine expression density, the branching of dendrites, and the expression of long-term potentiation as its secretion is continued diffusely by the GABAergic cortical interneurons those origin is traced to the medial ganglionic eminence.

In the adult organism the non-neural expression is much less widespread, but goes up sharply when some organs are injured. The exact function of reelin upregulation following an injury is still being researched.

==Evolutionary significance==
Reelin-DAB1 interactions could have played a key role in the structural evolution of the cortex that evolved from a single layer in the common predecessor of the amniotes into multiple-layered cortex of contemporary mammals. Research shows that reelin expression goes up as the cortex becomes more complex, reaching the maximum in the human brain in which the reelin-secreting Cajal-Retzius cells have significantly more complex axonal arbour. Reelin is present in the telencephalon of all the vertebrates studied so far, but the pattern of expression differs widely. For example, zebrafish have no Cajal-Retzius cells at all; instead, the protein is being secreted by other neurons. These cells do not form a dedicated layer in amphibians, and radial migration in their brains is very weak.

As the cortex becomes more complex and convoluted, migration along the radial glia fibers becomes more important for the proper lamination. The emergence of a distinct reelin-secreting layer is thought to play an important role in this evolution. There are conflicting data concerning the importance of this layer, and these are explained in the literature either by the existence of an additional signaling positional mechanism that interacts with the reelin cascade, or by the assumption that mice that are used in such experiments have redundant secretion of reelin compared with more localized synthesis in the human brain.

Cajal-Retzius cells, most of which disappear around the time of birth, coexpress reelin with the HAR1 gene that is thought to have undergone the most significant evolutionary change in humans compared with chimpanzee, being the most &quot;evolutionary accelerated&quot; of the genes from the human accelerated regions. There is also evidence of that variants in the DAB1 gene have been included in a recent selective sweep in Chinese populations.

==Mechanism of action==
=== Receptors ===
Reelin&#x27;s control of cell-cell interactions is thought to be mediated by binding of reelin to the two members of low density lipoprotein receptor gene family: VLDLR and the ApoER2. The two main reelin receptors seem to have slightly different roles: VLDLR conducts the stop signal, while ApoER2 is essential for the migration of late-born neocortical neurons. It also has been shown that the N-terminal region of reelin, a site distinct from the region of reelin shown to associate with VLDLR/ApoER2 binds to the alpha-3-beta-1 integrin receptor. The proposal that the protocadherin CNR1 behaves as a Reelin receptor has been disproven.

As members of lipoprotein receptor superfamily, both VLDLR and ApoER2 have in their structure an internalization domain called NPxY motif. After binding to the receptors reelin is internalized by endocytosis, and the N-terminal fragment of the protein is re-secreted. This fragment may serve postnatally to prevent apical dendrites of cortical layer II/III pyramidal neurons from overgrowth, acting via a pathway independent of canonical reelin receptors.

Reelin receptors are present on both neurons and glial cells. Furthermore, radial glia express the same amount of ApoER2 but being ten times less rich in VLDLR. beta-1 integrin receptors on glial cells play more important role in neuronal layering than the same receptors on the migrating neuroblasts.

Reelin-dependent strengthening of long-term potentiation is caused by ApoER2 interaction with NMDA receptor. This interaction happens when ApoER2 has a region coded by exon 19. ApoER2 gene is alternatively spliced, with the exon 19-containing variant more actively produced during periods of activity. According to one study, the hippocampal reelin expression rapidly goes up when there is need to store a memory, as demethylases open up the RELN gene. The activation of dendrite growth by reelin is apparently conducted through Src family kinases and is dependent upon the expression of Crk family proteins, consistent with the interaction of Crk and CrkL with tyrosine-phosphorylated Dab1. Moreover, a Cre-loxP recombination mouse model that lacks Crk and CrkL in most neurons was reported to have the reeler phenotype, indicating that Crk/CrkL lie between DAB1 and Akt in the reelin signaling chain.

=== Signaling cascades ===
Reelin activates the signaling cascade of Notch-1, inducing the expression of FABP7 and prompting progenitor cells to assume radial glial phenotype. In addition, corticogenesis &quot;in vivo&quot; is highly dependent upon reelin being processed by embryonic neurons, which are thought to secrete some as yet unidentified metalloproteinases that free the central signal-competent part of the protein. Some other unknown proteolytic mechanisms may also play a role. It is supposed that full-sized reelin sticks to the extracellular matrix fibers on the higher levels, and the central fragments, as they are being freed up by the breaking up of reelin, are able to permeate into the lower levels. It is possible that as neuroblasts reach the higher levels they stop their migration either because of the heightened combined expression of all forms of reelin, or due to the peculiar mode of action of the full-sized reelin molecules and its homodimers.

The intracellular adaptor DAB1 binds to the VLDLR and ApoER2 through an NPxY motif and is involved in transmission of Reelin signals through these lipoprotein receptors. It becomes phosphorylated by Src and Fyn kinases and apparently stimulates the actin cytoskeleton to change its shape, affecting the proportion of integrin receptors on the cell surface, which leads to the change in adhesion. Phosphorylation of DAB1 leads to its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, and this explains the heightened levels of DAB1 in the absence of reelin. Such negative feedback is thought to be important for proper cortical lamination. Activated by two antibodies, VLDLR and ApoER2 cause DAB1 phosphorylation but seemingly without the subsequent degradation and without rescuing the reeler phenotype, and this may indicate that a part of the signal is conducted independently of DAB1.

A protein having an important role in lissencephaly and accordingly called LIS1 (PAFAH1B1), was shown to interact with the intracellular segment of VLDLR, thus reacting to the activation of reelin pathway.

=== Complexes ===
Reelin molecules have been shown to form a large protein complex, a disulfide-linked homodimer. If the homodimer fails to form, efficient tyrosine phosphorylation of DAB1 &quot;in vitro&quot; fails. Moreover, the two main receptors of reelin are able to form clusters that most probably play a major role in the signaling, causing the intracellular adaptor DAB1 to dimerize or oligomerize in its turn. Such clustering has been shown in the study to activate the signaling chain even in the absence of Reelin itself. In addition, reelin itself can cut the peptide bonds holding other proteins together, being a serine protease, and this may affect the cellular adhesion and migration processes. Reelin signaling leads to phosphorylation of actin-interacting protein cofilin 1 at ser3; this may stabilize the actin cytoskeleton and anchor the leading processes of migrating neuroblasts, preventing their further growth.

=== Interaction with Cdk5 ===
Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), a major regulator of neuronal migration and positioning, is known to phosphorylate DAB1 and other cytosolic targets of reelin signaling, such as Tau, which could be activated also via reelin-induced deactivation of GSK3B, and NUDEL, associated with Lis1, one of the DAB1 targets. LTP induction by reelin in hippocampal slices fails in p35 knockouts. P35 is a key Cdk5 activator, and double p35/Dab1, p35/RELN, p35/ApoER2, p35/VLDLR knockouts display increased neuronal migration deficits, indicating a synergistic action of reelin → ApoER2/VLDLR → DAB1 and p35/p39 → Cdk5 pathways in the normal corticogenesis.

== Possible pathological role ==

=== Lissencephaly ===
Disruptions of the RELN gene are considered to be the cause of the rare form of lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia classed as a microlissencephaly called Norman-Roberts syndrome. The mutations disrupt splicing of the RELN mRNA transcript, resulting in low or undetectable amounts of reelin protein. The phenotype in these patients was characterized by hypotonia, ataxia, and developmental delay, with lack of unsupported sitting and profound mental retardation with little or no language development. Seizures and congenital lymphedema are also present. A novel chromosomal translocation causing the syndrome was described in 2007.

=== Schizophrenia ===
Reduced expression of reelin and its mRNA levels in the brains of schizophrenia sufferers had been reported in 1998 and 2000, and independently confirmed in postmortem studies of the hippocampus, cerebellum, basal ganglia, and cerebral cortex. The reduction may reach up to 50% in some brain regions and is coupled with reduced expression of GAD-67 enzyme, which catalyses the transition of glutamate to GABA. Blood levels of reelin and its isoforms are also altered in schizophrenia, along with mood disorders, according to one study. Reduced reelin mRNA prefrontal expression in schizophrenia was found to be the most statistically relevant disturbance found in the multicenter study conducted in 14 separate laboratories in 2001 by Stanley Foundation Neuropathology Consortium.

Epigenetic hypermethylation of DNA in schizophrenia patients is proposed as a cause of the reduction, in agreement with the observations dating from the 1960s that administration of methionine to schizophrenic patients results in a profound exacerbation of schizophrenia symptoms in sixty to seventy percent of patients. The proposed mechanism is a part of the &quot;epigenetic hypothesis for schizophrenia pathophysiology&quot; formulated by a group of scientists in 2008 (D. Grayson; A. Guidotti; E. Costa). A postmortem study comparing a DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) and Reelin mRNA expression in cortical layers I and V of schizophrenic patients and normal controls demonstrated that in the layer V both DNMT1 and Reelin levels were normal, while in the layer I DNMT1 was threefold higher, probably leading to the twofold decrease in the Reelin expression. There is evidence that the change is selective, and DNMT1 is overexpressed in reelin-secreting GABAergic neurons but not in their glutamatergic neighbours. Methylation inhibitors and histone deacetylase inhibitors, such as valproic acid, increase reelin mRNA levels, while L-methionine treatment downregulates the phenotypic expression of reelin.

One study indicated the upregulation of histone deacetylase HDAC1 in the hippocampi of patients. Histone deacetylases suppress gene promoters; hyperacetylation of histones was shown in murine models to demethylate the promoters of both reelin and GAD67. DNMT1 inhibitors in animals have been shown to increase the expression of both reelin and GAD67, and both DNMT inhibitors and HDAC inhibitors shown in one study to activate both genes with comparable dose- and time-dependence. As one study shows, S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) concentration in patients&#x27; prefrontal cortex is twice as high as in the cortices of non-affected people. SAM, being a methyl group donor necessary for DNMT activity, could further shift epigenetic control of gene expression.

Chromosome region 7q22 that harbours the &quot;RELN&quot; gene is associated with schizophrenia, and the gene itself was associated with the disease in a large study that found the polymorphism rs7341475 to increase the risk of the disease in women, but not in men. The women that have the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) are about 1.4 times more likely to get ill, according to the study. Allelic variations of RELN have also been correlated with working memory, memory and executive functioning in nuclear families where one of the members suffers from schizophrenia. The association with working memory was later replicated. In one small study, nonsynonymous polymorphism Val997Leu of the gene was associated with left and right ventricular enlargement in patients.

One study showed that patients have decreased levels of one of reelin receptors, VLDLR, in the peripheral lymphocytes. After six months of antipsychotic therapy the expression went up; according to authors, peripheral VLRLR levels may serve as a reliable peripheral biomarker of schizophrenia.

Considering the role of reelin in promoting dendritogenesis, suggestions were made that the localized dendritic spine deficit observed in schizophrenia could be in part connected with the downregulation of reelin.

Reelin pathway could also be linked to schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders through its interaction with risk genes. One example is the neuronal transcription factor NPAS3, disruption of which is linked to schizophrenia and learning disability. Knockout mice lacking NPAS3 or the similar protein NPAS1 have significantly lower levels of reelin; the precise mechanism behind this is unknown. Another example is the schizophrenia-linked gene MTHFR, with murine knockouts showing decreased levels of reelin in the cerebellum. Along the same line, it is worth noting that the gene coding for the subunit NR2B that is presumably affected by reelin in the process of NR2B-&gt;NR2A developmental change of NMDA receptor composition, stands as one of the strongest risk gene candidates. Another shared aspect between NR2B and RELN is that they both can be regulated by the TBR1 transcription factor.

The heterozygous reeler mouse, which is haploinsufficient for the RELN gene, shares several neurochemical and behavioral abnormalities with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but the exact relevance of these murine behavioral changes to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia remains debatable.

As previously described, reelin plays a crucial role in modulating early neuroblast migration during brain development. Evidences of altered neural cell positioning in post-mortem schizophrenia patient brains and changes to gene regulatory networks that control cell migration suggests a potential link between altered reelin expression in patient brain tissue to disrupted cell migration during brain development. To model the role of reelin in the context of schizophrenia at a cellular level, olfactory neurosphere-derived cells were generated from the nasal biopsies of schizophrenia patients, and compared to cells from healthy controls. Schizophrenia patient-derived cells have reduced levels of reelin mRNA and protein when compared to healthy control cells, but expresses the key reelin receptors and DAB1 accessory protein. When grown &quot;in vitro&quot;, schizophrenia patient-derived cells were unable to respond to reelin coated onto tissue culture surfaces; In contrast, cells derived from healthy controls were able to alter their cell migration when exposed to reelin. This work went on to show that the lack of cell migration response in patient-derived cells were caused by the cell&#x27;s inability to produce enough focal adhesions of the appropriate size when in contact with extracellular reelin. More research into schizophrenia cell-based models are needed to look at the function of reelin, or lack of, in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.

=== Bipolar disorder ===
Decrease in RELN expression with concurrent upregulation of DNMT1 is typical of bipolar disorder with psychosis, but is not characteristic of patients with major depression without psychosis, which could speak of specific association of the change with psychoses. One study suggests that unlike in schizophrenia, such changes are found only in the cortex and do not affect the deeper structures in psychotic bipolar patients, as their basal ganglia were found to have the normal levels of DNMT1 and subsequently both the reelin and GAD67 levels were within the normal range.

In a genetic study conducted in 2009, preliminary evidence requiring further DNA replication suggested that variation of the RELN gene (SNP rs362719) may be associated with susceptibility to bipolar disorder in women.

===Autism===
Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is generally believed to be caused by mutations in several locations, likely triggered by environmental factors. The role of reelin in autism is not decided yet.

Reelin was originally in 2001 implicated in a study finding associations between autism and a polymorphic GGC/CGG repeat preceding the 5&#x27; ATG initiator codon of the RELN gene in an Italian population. Longer triplet repeats in the 5&#x27; region were associated with an increase in autism susceptibility. However, another study of 125 multiple-incidence families and 68 single-incidence families from the subsequent year found no significant difference between the length of the polymorphic repeats in affected and controls. Although, using a family based association test larger &quot;reelin&quot; alleles were found to be transmitted more frequently than expected to affected children. An additional study examining 158 subjects with German lineage likewise found no evidence of triplet repeat polymorphisms associated with autism. And a larger study from 2004 consisting of 395 families found no association between autistic subjects and the CGG triplet repeat as well as the allele size when compared to age of first word.
In 2010 a large study using data from 4 European cohorts would find some evidence for an association between autism and the rs362780 RELN polymorphism.

Studies of transgenic mice have been suggestive of an association, but not definitive.

===Temporal lobe epilepsy: granule cell dispersion===
Decreased reelin expression in the hippocampal tissue samples from patients with temporal lobe epilepsy was found to be directly correlated with the extent of granule cell dispersion (GCD), a major feature of the disease that is noted in 45%–73% of patients. The dispersion, according to a small study, is associated with the RELN promoter hypermethylation. According to one study, prolonged seizures in a rat model of mesial temporal lobe epilepsy have led to the loss of reelin-expressing interneurons and subsequent ectopic chain migration and aberrant integration of newborn dentate granule cells. Without reelin, the chain-migrating neuroblasts failed to detach properly. Moreover, in a kainate-induced mouse epilepsy model, exogenous reelin had prevented GCD, according to one study.

===Alzheimer&#x27;s disease===
The Reelin receptors ApoER2 and VLDLR belong to the LDL receptor gene family. All members of this family are receptors for Apolipoprotein E (ApoE). Therefore, they are often synonymously referred to as &#x27;ApoE receptors&#x27;. ApoE occurs in 3 common isoforms (E2, E3, E4) in the human population. ApoE4 is the primary genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. This strong genetic association has led to the proposal that ApoE receptors play a central role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. According to one study, reelin expression and glycosylation patterns are altered in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. In the cortex of the patients, reelin levels were 40% higher compared with controls, but the cerebellar levels of the protein remain normal in the same patients. This finding is in agreement with an earlier study showing the presence of Reelin associated with amyloid plaques in a transgenic AD mouse model. A large genetic study of 2008 showed that RELN gene variation is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in women. The number of reelin-producing Cajal-Retzius cells is significantly decreased in the first cortical layer of patients. Reelin has been shown to interact with amyloid precursor protein, and, according to one in-vitro study, is able to counteract the Aβ-induced dampening of NMDA-receptor activity. This is modulated by ApoE isoforms, which selectively alter the recycling of ApoER2 as well as AMPA and NMDA receptors.

=== Cancer ===
DNA methylation patterns are often changed in tumours, and the RELN gene could be affected: according to one study, in the pancreatic cancer the expression is suppressed, along with other reelin pathway components In the same study, cutting the reelin pathway in cancer cells that still expressed reelin resulted in increased motility and invasiveness. On the contrary, in prostate cancer the RELN expression is excessive and correlates with Gleason score. Retinoblastoma presents another example of RELN overexpression. This gene has also been seen recurrently mutated in cases of acute lymphoblastic leukaemia.&lt;ref name=&quot;doi.10.1038/nature10725&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other conditions ===
One genome-wide association study indicates a possible role for RELN gene variation in otosclerosis, an abnormal growth of bone of the middle ear. In a statistical search for the genes that are differentially expressed in the brains of cerebral malaria-resistant versus cerebral malaria-susceptible mice, Delahaye et al. detected a significant upregulation of both RELN and DAB1 and speculated on possible protective effects of such over-expression. In 2020, a study reported a novel variant in &quot;RELN&quot; gene (S2486G) which was associated with ankylosing spondylitis in a large family. This suggested a potential insight into the pathophysiological involvement of reelin via inflammation and osteogenesis pathways in ankylosing spondylitis, and it could broaden the horizon toward new therapeutic strategies. A 2020 study from UT Southwestern Medical Center suggests circulating Reelin levels might correlate with MS severity and stages, and that lowering Reelin levels might be a novel way to treat MS.

== Factors affecting reelin expression ==

The expression of reelin is controlled by a number of factors besides the sheer number of Cajal-Retzius cells. For example, TBR1 transcription factor regulates RELN along with other T-element-containing genes. On a higher level, increased maternal care was found to correlate with reelin expression in rat pups; such correlation was reported in hippocampus and in the cortex. According to one report, prolonged exposure to corticosterone significantly decreased reelin expression in murine hippocampi, a finding possibly pertinent to the hypothetical role of corticosteroids in depression. One small postmortem study has found increased methylation of RELN gene in the neocortex of persons past their puberty compared with those that had yet to enter the period of maturation.

===Psychotropic medication===
As reelin is being implicated in a number of brain disorders and its expression is usually measured posthumously, assessing the possible medication effects is important.

According to the epigenetic hypothesis, drugs that shift the balance in favour of demethylation have a potential to alleviate the proposed methylation-caused downregulation of RELN and GAD67. In one study, clozapine and sulpiride but not haloperidol and olanzapine were shown to increase the demethylation of both genes in mice pretreated with l-methionine. Valproic acid, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, when taken in combination with antipsychotics, is proposed to have some benefits. But there are studies conflicting the main premise of the epigenetic hypothesis, and a study by Fatemi et al. shows no increase in RELN expression by valproic acid; that indicates the need for further investigation.

Fatemi et al. conducted the study in which RELN mRNA and reelin protein levels were measured in rat prefrontal cortex following a 21-day of intraperitoneal injections of the following drugs:
In 2009, Fatemi et al. published the more detailed work on rats using the same medication. Here, cortical expression of several participants (VLDLR, DAB1, GSK3B) of the signaling chain was measured besides reelin itself, and also the expression of GAD65 and GAD67.

<text>Walter John Matthau ( Matthow; ; October 1, 1920 – July 1, 2000) was an American screen and stage actor, known for his &quot;hangdog face&quot; and for playing world-weary characters. He starred in 10 films alongside his real-life friend Jack Lemmon, including &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; (1968) and &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot; (1993). &quot;The New York Times&quot; called this &quot;one of Hollywood&#x27;s most successful pairings&quot;. Among other accolades, he was an Academy Award, a two-time BAFTA Award, and two-time Tony Award winner.

On Broadway, Matthau originated the role of Oscar Madison in &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; by playwright Neil Simon, for which he received a Tony Award for Best Leading Actor in a Play in 1965, his second after &quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot; in 1962. He won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in the Billy Wilder film &quot;The Fortune Cookie&quot; (1966), with further Best Actor nominations for &quot;Kotch&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; (1975). He gained further recognition for his portrayal of the coach of a hapless little league team in the baseball comedy &quot;The Bad News Bears&quot; (1976).

Matthau is also known for his performances in Elia Kazan&#x27;s &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; (1957), the Elvis Presley vehicle &quot;King Creole&quot; (1958), Stanley Donen&#x27;s romance &quot;Charade&quot; (1963), &quot;Fail Safe&quot; (1964), Gene Kelly&#x27;s musical &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; (1969), Elaine May&#x27;s screwball comedy &quot;A New Leaf&quot; (1971) and Herbert Ross&#x27;s ensemble comedy &quot;California Suite&quot; (1978). He also starred in &quot;Plaza Suite&quot; (1971), &quot;Charley Varrick&quot; (1973), &quot;The Taking of Pelham One Two Three&quot; (1974), &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; (1975), &quot;House Calls&quot; (1978), &quot;Hopscotch&quot; (1980) and &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; (1993).

In 1982, he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

==Early life==

Matthau was born Walter John Matthow on October 1, 1920, in New York City&#x27;s Lower East Side. He had two brothers, one older and one younger.

His parents were Jewish; his mother, Rose ( Berolsky or Beransky), was a Lithuanian immigrant who worked in a garment sweatshop, and his father, Milton Matuschansky, was a Ukrainian peddler and electrician from Kyiv. They married in New York in 1917.

A &quot;New York Times&quot; interview described his early years: &quot;When Matthau was 3 years old, and his older brother, Henry, was 5, his father…lit out for parts unknown, leaving him and his brother to be raised by their mother….In 1935…Matthau learned of his father’s death in Bellvue Hospital….During his childhood, Matthau…lived in a succession of cold-water tenement apartments in the Ukrainian area of the Lower East Side…being forced to vacate each apartment after only a few months because they’d got so hopelessly far behind in the rent that their landlord would have them evicted….Matthau…hasn’t the slightest nostalgia these days for his poverty-ridden childhood, ‘It was a nightmare—a dreadful, horrible, stinking nightmare,’ he grimly remembers.”

As part of a lifelong love of practical jokes, Matthau created the rumors that his middle name was &quot;Foghorn&quot; and his last name was originally &quot;Matuschanskayasky&quot; (under which he is credited for a cameo role in the film &quot;Earthquake&quot;).

As a young boy, Matthau attended a Jewish non-profit sleepaway camp, Tranquillity Camp, where he began acting in the shows that the camp staged on Saturday nights. He also attended Surprise Lake Camp. His high school was Seward Park High School. He worked for a short time as a concession stand cashier in the Yiddish Theatre District.

==World War II==
During World War II, Matthau saw active service as a radioman-gunner on a Consolidated B-24 Liberator bomber in the U.S. Army Air Forces with the Eighth Air Force in England. He was with the same 453rd Bombardment Group as James Stewart. While based in England at RAF Old Buckenham, Norfolk, he flew missions to continental Europe during the Battle of the Bulge. He ended the war with the rank of Staff Sergeant and returned home to America for demobilization at the war&#x27;s end, intent on pursuing a career as an actor.

==Acting career==
===Early work===
Matthau was trained in acting at the Dramatic Workshop of The New School with German director Erwin Piscator. He often joked that his best early review came in a play where he posed as a derelict. One reviewer said, &quot;The others just looked like actors in make-up, Walter Matthau really looks like a skid row bum!&quot; Matthau was a respected stage actor for years in such fare as &quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&quot; and &quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot;, for his performance in the latter winning the 1962 Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Play.
Matthau appeared in the pilot of &quot;Mister Peepers&quot; (1952) with Wally Cox. For reasons unknown, he used the name Leonard Elliot. His role was of the gym teacher Mr. Wall. He made his motion picture debut as a whip-wielding bad guy in &quot;The Kentuckian&quot; (1955) opposite Burt Lancaster. He played a villain in &quot;King Creole&quot; (1958), in which he gets beaten up by Elvis Presley. Around the same time, he made &quot;Ride a Crooked Trail&quot; with Audie Murphy, and &quot;Onionhead&quot; (both 1958) starring Andy Griffith; the latter a box-office flop. Matthau and Griffith appeared previously the critical and box-office hit &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; (1957), directed by Elia Kazan. Matthau appeared with James Mason in &quot;Bigger Than Life&quot; (1956), directed by Nicholas Ray. Matthau directed a low-budget movie called &quot;The Gangster Story&quot; (1960) and played a sympathetic sheriff in &quot;Lonely Are the Brave&quot; (1962), which starred Kirk Douglas. He appeared in the Cary Grant-Audrey Hepburn crime thriller &quot;Charade&quot; (1963).

On television, he appeared twice on &quot;Naked City&quot;, as well as in four installments of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;. He appeared eight times between 1962 and 1964 on &quot;The DuPont Show of the Week&quot; and as Franklin Gaer in an episode of &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot; (&quot;Man Is a Rock&quot;, 1964).

===1960s===

Comedies were rare in Matthau&#x27;s work at that time. He was cast in a number of stark dramas, such as &quot;Fail Safe&quot; (1964), in which he portrayed Pentagon adviser Dr. Groeteschele, who urges an all-out nuclear attack on the Soviet Union in response to an accidental transmission of an attack signal to U.S. Air Force bombers. Neil Simon cast him in the play &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; in 1965, with Matthau playing slovenly sportswriter Oscar Madison, opposite Art Carney as Felix Ungar. Matthau reprised the role in the film version, with Jack Lemmon as Felix Unger. He played detective Ted Casselle in the Hitchcockian thriller &quot;Mirage&quot; (1965), directed by Edward Dmytryk.

He achieved great success in the comedy film &quot;The Fortune Cookie&quot; (1966) as shyster lawyer William H. &quot;Whiplash Willie&quot; Gingrich, starring yet again opposite Lemmon; the first of many collaborations with Billy Wilder, and a role that would earn him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Filming had to be placed on a five-month hiatus after Matthau had a serious heart attack. He gave up his three-pack-a-day smoking habit as a result. Matthau appeared during the Oscar telecast shortly after having been injured in a bicycle accident; nonetheless, he scolded actors who had not attended the ceremony, especially the other major award winners that night: Paul Scofield, Elizabeth Taylor and Sandy Dennis. Broadway-hits-cum-films continued to cast Matthau in lead roles such as &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; and &quot;Cactus Flower&quot; (both 1969); for the latter, Goldie Hawn received an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.

===1970s===
It was during this time that Matthau began to appear in more comedy films, including the black comedy &quot;A New Leaf&quot; (1971) and the comedy-drama &quot;Pete &#x27;n&#x27; Tillie&quot; (1972). Oscar nominations would come his way again for &quot;Kotch&quot; (1971), directed by Lemmon, and &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; (1975). The latter was another adaptation of a Neil Simon stage play—this time about a pair of former vaudeville stars. For the latter, he won a Golden Globe award for Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy, tying with his co-star George Burns. Meanwhile, their other co-star, Richard Benjamin, won a supporting award.

Matthau played three roles in the film version of Simon&#x27;s &quot;Plaza Suite&quot; (1971), and was in the cast of its followup &quot;California Suite&quot; (1978). He starred in &quot;House Calls&quot; (1978), sharing the screen with Glenda Jackson and his &quot;Odd Couple&quot; stage partner, Carney.

Matthau starred in three crime dramas in the mid-1970s: as a detective investigating a mass murder on a bus in &quot;The Laughing Policeman&quot; (1973), as a bank robber on the run from the Mafia and the law in &quot;Charley Varrick&quot; (also 1973) and as a New York transit official in the action-thriller &quot;The Taking of Pelham One Two Three&quot; (1974). He also reunited with Lemmon in the black comedy-drama &quot;The Front Page&quot; (1974). A change of pace about misfits and delinquents on a Little League baseball team turned out to be a solid hit when Matthau starred as coach Morris Buttermaker in the comedy &quot;The Bad News Bears&quot; (1976).

===1980s===
Matthau produced some films with Universal Pictures, with his son Charlie also becoming involved in his production company, Walcar Productions, but the only film that he produced was the third remake of &quot;Little Miss Marker&quot; (1980).

He was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for his portrayal of former CIA field operative Miles Kendig in the elaborate spy comedy &quot;Hopscotch&quot; (1980), reuniting with Jackson. The original script, a dark work based on the novel of the same name, was rewritten and transformed into a comedy in order to play to Matthau&#x27;s specific talents. The rewrite was a condition of his participation. Matthau participated in the script revisions, and the film&#x27;s director Ronald Neame observed that Matthau&#x27;s contributions entitled him to screen credit, but that was never pursued. Matthau wrote the scene in which Kendig and Isobel—apparently strangers—meet in a Salzburg restaurant and strike up a conversation about wine that ends in a passionate kiss. He also wrote the last scene of the film, where Kendig, presumed to be dead, disguises himself as a Sikh to enter a bookshop. He also helped to choose appropriate compositions by Mozart that made up much of the score. TCM&#x27;s Susan Doll observes that &quot;&quot;Hopscotch&quot; could be considered the end of a long career peak or the beginning of (Matthau&#x27;s) slide downhill, depending on the viewpoint&quot;, as character parts and supporting parts became the only thing available to an actor his age.

The next year, he was nominated again for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy for his portrayal of the fictional Associate Justice Daniel Snow in &quot;First Monday in October&quot; (1981). The film was about the (then-fictional) first appointment of a woman (played by Jill Clayburgh) to the Supreme Court of the United States. It was scheduled for release in 1982, but when President Ronald Reagan named Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor in July 1981, the release date was moved up to August 1981. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Janet Maslin disliked the film but praised Matthau&#x27;s performance. 

Matthau reunited with Lemmon in the comedy &quot;Buddy Buddy&quot; (1981). He also portrayed Herbert Tucker in &quot;I Ought to Be in Pictures&quot; (1982) with Ann-Margret and Dinah Manoff. He co-starred with Robin Williams in the 1983 dark comedy film &quot;The Survivors&quot;. Although a box-office dud that barely grossed its budget, the film found a new audience via repeated broadcasts on cable TV in the following years. He took the leading role of Captain Thomas Bartholomew Red in Roman Polanski&#x27;s swashbuckler &quot;Pirates&quot; (1986).

During the 1980s and 1990s, Matthau served on the advisory board of the National Student Film Institute.

===1990s===
Matthau narrated the &quot;Doctor Seuss Video Classics: How the Grinch Stole Christmas!&quot; (1992), and played the role of George Wilson in the film &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; (1993). In a change of pace, Matthau played Albert Einstein in the film &quot;I.Q.&quot; (1994) starring Tim Robbins and Meg Ryan.

His partnership with Jack Lemmon became one of the most enduring collaborations in Hollywood. They became lifelong friends after making &quot;The Fortune Cookie&quot; and would make a total of 10 movies together—11 counting &quot;Kotch&quot;, in which Lemmon has a cameo as a sleeping bus passenger. Apart from their many comedies, the two appeared (although they did not share any scenes) in the Oliver Stone drama &quot;JFK&quot; (1991). Matthau and Lemmon reunited for the comedy &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot; (1993), co-starring Ann-Margret, and its sequel &quot;Grumpier Old Men&quot; (1995), co-starring Sophia Loren. This led to further pairings late in their careers, including appearances in &quot;The Grass Harp&quot; (1995), &quot;Out to Sea&quot; (1997) and a Simon-scripted sequel to their much earlier success, &quot;The Odd Couple II&quot; (1998).

&quot;Hanging Up&quot; (2000), directed by Diane Keaton, was Matthau&#x27;s final appearance onscreen.

==Personal life==
===Marriage and children===
In 1948, Matthau married Geraldine &quot;Geri&quot; Grace Johnson. Their son David was born in 1953 and their daughter Jenny was born in 1956. The couple divorced in 1959.

Matthau married Carol Marcus in 1959. She died in 2003. Their son Charles (Charlie) Matthau was born in 1962. Charlie is a director and directed his father in several movies.

In 1971 Matthau discussed his longtime compulsive gambling with a &quot;New York Times&quot; writer. In the late 1960s, while doing a two-week television shoot in Florida for &quot;Tallahassee 7000,&quot; he had lost $183,000, mostly betting on spring-training baseball games. It took Matthau six years to pay off his &quot;Mafia-connected bookmaker,&quot; and he curtailed his betting somewhat in the 1970s, though daily racetrack losses of $400-500 were common.

===Health problems===
A heavy smoker, Matthau had a heart attack in 1966 while filming &quot;The Fortune Cookie&quot;, the first of at least three in his lifetime.

In 1976, ten years after his first heart attack, he underwent heart-bypass surgery. After working in Minnesota for &quot;Grumpy Old Men&quot; (1993), he was hospitalized for double pneumonia. In December 1995, he had a colon tumor removed, apparently successfully, as there was no mention of cancer in his death certificate. He was hospitalized in May 1999 for more than two months, again owing to pneumonia.

His death certificate lists the causes of death as &quot;cardiac arrest&quot; and &quot;atherosclerotic heart disease&quot;, with &quot;end stage renal disease&quot; and &quot;atrial fibrillation&quot; as significant contributing factors. There is no mention of cancer.

===Death===
On the late evening of June 30, 2000, Matthau had a heart attack at his home and was taken by ambulance to the St. John&#x27;s Health Center in Santa Monica, where he died a few hours later at 1:42 a.m. on July 1, 2000, at age 79. He is buried at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. Matthau&#x27;s wife Carol Marcus died in 2003, and her body is interred in the same plot as her husband.

<text>Neuropil (or &quot;neuropile&quot;) is any area in the nervous system composed of mostly unmyelinated axons, dendrites and glial cell processes that forms a synaptically dense region containing a relatively low number of cell bodies. The most prevalent anatomical region of neuropil is the brain which, although not completely composed of neuropil, does have the largest and highest synaptically concentrated areas of neuropil in the body. For example, the neocortex and olfactory bulb both contain neuropil.

White matter, which is mostly composed of myelinated axons (hence its white color) and glial cells, is generally not considered to be a part of the neuropil.

Neuropil (pl. neuropils) comes from the Greek: &quot;neuro&quot;, meaning &quot;tendon, sinew; nerve&quot; and &quot;pilos&quot;, meaning &quot;felt&quot;. The term&#x27;s origin can be traced back to the late 19th century.

==Location==
Neuropil has been found in the following regions: outer neocortex layer, barrel cortex, inner plexiform layer and outer plexiform layer, posterior pituitary, and glomeruli of the cerebellum. These are all found in humans, with the exception of the barrel cortex, but many species have counterparts similar to our own regions of neuropil. However, the degree of similarity depends upon the composition of neuropil being compared. The concentrations of neuropil within certain regions are important to determine because simply using the proportions of the different postsynaptic elements does not verify the necessary, conclusive evidence. Comparing the concentrations can determine whether or not proportions of different postsynaptic elements contacted a particular axonal pathway. Relative concentrations could signify a reflection of different postsynaptic elements in the neuropil or show that axons sought out and formed synapses only with specific postsynaptic elements.

==Function==
Since neuropils have a diverse role in the nervous system, it is difficult to define a certain overarching function for all neuropils. For instance, the olfactory glomeruli function as sorts of way-stations for the information flowing from the olfactory receptor neurons to the olfactory cortex. The inner plexiform layer of the retina is a little more complex. The bipolar cells post-synaptic to either rods or cones are either depolarized or hyperpolarized depending on whether the bipolar cells have sign-inverting synapses or a sign-conserving synapses.

===Efficiency in the brain===
Neurons are necessary for all connections made in the brain, and thus can be thought of as the &quot;wires&quot; of the brain. As in computing, an entity is most efficient when its wires are optimized; therefore, a brain which has undergone millions of years of natural selection would be expected to have optimized neural circuitry. To have an optimized neural system it must balance four variables—it must &quot;minimize conduction delays in axons, passive cable attenuation in dendrites, and the length of &#x27;wire&#x27; used to construct circuits&quot; as well as &quot;maximize the density of synapses&quot;, essentially optimizing the neuropil. Researchers at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory formulated the optimal balance of the four variables and calculated the optimal ratio of axon plus dendrite volume (i.e. the &quot;wire&quot; volume or neuropil volume) to total volume of grey matter. The formula predicted an optimal brain with 3/5 (60%) of its volume occupied by neuropil. Experimental evidence taken from three mouse brains agrees with this result. The &quot;fraction of wire is 0.59 ± 0.036 for layer IV of visual cortex, 0.62 ± 0.055 for layer Ib of piriform cortex, and 0.54 ± 0.035 for the stratum radiatum of hippocampal field CA1. The overall average is 0.585 ± 0.043; these values are not statistically different from the optimal 3/5.&quot;

==Clinical significance==

===Schizophrenia===
It has been shown that a certain protein synaptophysin is lost in people with schizophrenia that causes dendrites and spines to deteriorate in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, a part of the neocortex, which plays a key role in information processing, attention, memory, orderly thinking and planning which are all functions that deteriorate in people with schizophrenia. The deterioration of the neuropil in this cortex has been proposed as a contributor to schizophrenia pathophysiology.

===Alzheimer&#x27;s disease===
Alzheimer&#x27;s is a neuropathological disease that is hypothesized to result from the loss of dendritic spines and/or deformation of these spines in the patient&#x27;s frontal and temporal cortices. Researchers have tied the disease to a decrease in the expression of drebrin, a protein thought to play a role in long-term potentiation, meaning the neurons would lose plasticity and have trouble forming new connections. This malfunction presents itself in the form of helical filaments that tangle together in the neuropil. This same phenomenon seems to occur in the elderly as well.

==Other animals==
===Other mammals===
A significant non-human area of neuropil is the barrel cortex found in mammals with whiskers (e.g. cats, dogs and rodents); each &quot;barrel&quot; in the cortex is a region of neuropil where the input from a single whisker terminates.

===Arthropods===
The optic lobe of arthropods and the ganglia of the arthropod brain as well as the ganglia in the ventral nerve cord are unmyelinated and therefore belong to the class of neuropils.

==Research==
Research has focused on where neuropil is found in many different species in order to unveil the range of significance it has and possible functions.

===Recent studies===
In chimpanzees and humans the neuropil provides a proxy measure of total connectivity within a local region because it is composed mostly of dendrites, axons, and synapses.

In insects the central complex plays an important role in higher-order brain function. The neuropil in &quot;Drosophila&quot; Ellipsoid is composed of four substructures. Each section has been observed in several insects as well as the influence it has on behavior, however the exact function of this neuropil has proven elusive. Abnormal walking behavior and flight behavior are controlled primarily by the central complex and genetic mutations that disrupt the structure support the hypothesis that the central complex neuropil is a site of behavioral control. However, only specific components of the behavior were affected with the genetic mutations. For example, basic leg coordination of walking was normal, whereas speed, activity, and turning were affected. These observations suggest that the central complex not only plays a role in locomotor behavior, but fine tuning as well. There is also additional evidence that the neuropil may function in olfactory associative learning and memory.

Research has shown reduced neuropil in area 9 of schizophrenics, as well as consistent findings of reduced spine density in layer III pyramidal neurons of the temporal and frontal cortices.

<text>Year 478 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Mamercus and Structus (or, less frequently, year 276 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 478 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

<doc id="62822" wikidata="Q817828" url="?curid=62822" title="Bennelong">
<text>Woollarawarre Bennelong ( 1764 – 3 January 1813) was a senior man of the Eora, an Aboriginal Australian people of the Port Jackson area, at the time of the first British settlement in Australia. Bennelong served as an interlocutor between the Eora and the British, both in the colony of New South Wales and in Great Britain. He was the first Aboriginal man to visit Europe and return.

In 1789, he was abducted on the authority of Governor Arthur Phillip, who hoped to use Bennelong to establish contact with the native people. Bennelong escaped after several months. A tenuous relationship subsequently developed between Bennelong and the colonists with various attacks and reconciliations occurring throughout 1790. He came to be a significant ambassador of the Eora.

Bennelong was taken to Great Britain in 1792 and he resided in London for three years. Eventually his health deteriorated and in February 1795 he was returned to Australia. Bennelong soon returned to his native lifestyle, and later in life he developed alcoholism. He died at Kissing Point in 1813, aged about 48, and was buried in James Squire&#x27;s orchard.

== Background ==
Woollarawarre Bennelong, the son of Goorah-Goorah and Gagolh, was born circa 1764 on the south shore of the Parramatta River. He was a member of the Wangal clan, connected with the south side of the Parramatta River, having close ties with the Wallumedegal clan, on the west side of the river, and the Burramattagal clan near today&#x27;s Parramatta. He had several sisters, Wariwéar, Karangarang, Wûrrgan and Munânguri, who married important men from nearby clans, thereby creating political links for their brother. The island of Memel in Port Jackson was part of his personal property, inherited through his father.

He had five names, given at different times during the various ritual inductions he underwent. The other four are given as Wolarrebarre, Wogultrowe, Boinba, and Bundabunda. According to British officer Watkin Tench, Bennelong preferred to be called Woollarawarre.

== Capture and life in the British settlement ==
Bennelong was brought to the settlement at Sydney Cove in November 1789 by order of the governor, Arthur Phillip, who was under instructions from King George III to establish relationships with the indigenous populations. At that time, the Eora conscientiously avoided contact with the newcomers, and in desperation Phillip resorted to kidnapping. A man named Arabanoo was captured, but like many other Aboriginal people near the settlement, he died in a smallpox epidemic a few months later in May 1789. Bennelong was captured with Colebee on 25 November 1789 as part of Phillip&#x27;s plan to learn the language and customs of the local people. William Bradley painted a watercolour of the occasion and described the capture in his journal as the &quot;most unpleasant service&quot; he was ever ordered to undertake. At the time of his capture, Bennelong&#x27;s age was estimated at 25, and he was described as being &quot;of good stature, stoutly made&quot;, with a &quot;bold, intrepid countenance&quot;. His appetite was such that &quot;the ration of a week was insufficient to have kept him for a day&quot;, and &quot;love and war seemed his favourite pursuits&quot;.

Colebee soon escaped, but Bennelong stayed in the settlement for several months, then slipped away. Four months later, he was sighted by officers in Manly Cove, and Phillip was notified. The governor hurried over and approached Bennelong, who was with a group of roughly 20 warriors. Phillip took a gesture by Bennelong towards another Aboriginal man, Willemering, as an invitation for an introduction, and extended his hand to the latter, who responded by spearing Phillip in the shoulder. A scuffle broke out, but the officers led the governor away to safety.

Willemering was a kurdaitcha from Broken Bay, and it has been suggested by some historians that he had been enlisted by Bennelong to carry out payback for the latter&#x27;s sense of personal injury on having been kidnapped. In this view, some form of atonement was necessary as a prelude to any further arrangements with the colonists. Phillip ordered that no retaliation take place and Bennelong, some days later, turned up to visit him as he was recovering from the wound, and their relationship was renewed. In a gesture of kinship, Bennelong bestowed upon Phillip the Aboriginal name Wolawaree and learned to speak English. In 1790, Phillip built a hut for him on what became known as Bennelong Point (now occupied by the Sydney Opera House). 

However, their association remained tense after Bennelong&#x27;s friend, Bangai, was shot dead near Dawe&#x27;s Point by soldiers in December 1790 for his supposed role in stealing potatoes. Bennelong led a counter-raid by robbing settlers and demanded Phillip to tell him the name of the soldier who killed Bangai. Phillip still wanted to maintain the friendship and by February 1791, Bennelong and the governor had again reached a reconciliation.

== Visit to England ==
Bennelong and another Aboriginal man, named Yemmerrawanne (or Imeerawanyee), travelled with Phillip on &quot;Atlantic&quot; to England, boarding on 10 December 1792. Many historians have claimed that they were presented to King George III, but there is no direct evidence that this occurred. Soon after their arrival in England, they were hurriedly made clothes that would have been suitable for their presentation to the King.

Jack Brook reconstructs some of their activities from the expense claims lodged with the government. They visited St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and the Tower of London. A boat was hired, and they went bathing; they also went to the theatre. While in London, they resided with Henry Waterhouse, and when Yemmerrawanne became sick, they moved to Eltham and resided at the house of Edward Kent, where they were tended by Mr and Mrs Phillips, and met Lord Sydney.

Yemmerrawanne died while in Britain after a serious chest infection, and Bennelong&#x27;s health deteriorated. He returned to Sydney in February 1795 on , the ship that took surgeon George Bass to the colony for the first time. Bass nursed him back to health and in exchange Bennelong taught him a sufficient amount of Dharug to enable the former to communicate with the indigenous Eora on arriving in Sydney. Of the 2 years and 10 months he spent abroad, 18 months had been passed either at sea or on board ships in a dock.

== Return to New South Wales ==
Bennelong arrived back in Sydney on 7 September 1795. A letter he had drafted in 1796 to Mr and Mrs Phillip, thanking Mrs Phillip for caring for him in England and asking for stockings and a handkerchief, is the first known text written in English by an Indigenous Australian. 

Within a short time, he took to the bush, reappearing only occasionally to dine at the servants&#x27; table in Governor King&#x27;s residence. Many colonial reports complain of his refusal to rejoin &quot;polished society&quot;. He participated in fighting contests over women and officiated at traditional ceremonies, including the last recorded initiation ceremony in Port Jackson in 1797. Bennelong also developed an alcohol problem following his return to Australia.

===Spearing of a British soldier===
In December 1797, factional feuding between Bennelong&#x27;s associates and their opponents resulted in Bennelong&#x27;s colleague, Colebee, killing an Aboriginal man in a dishonourable fashion. Colebee was subsequently punished in public according to cultural law, but when British soldiers interfered to protect Colebee, Bennelong became enraged. He threw a spear at the soldiers, severely wounding one after the weapon pierced right through the man&#x27;s abdomen. Bennelong would have been instantly killed for this action had not the provost marshal Thomas Smyth, interceded and dragged Bennelong away. Bennelong was beaten on the head with the butt of a musket and incarcerated for a night. On being released, he threatened the white people and left the settlement.

After this incident, Bennelong became a disreputable person amongst the colonists, being described as &quot;a most insolent and troublesome savage&quot; whose retaliatory action of spearing a soldier had &quot;rendered him more hateful than any of his countrymen&quot;. Bennelong also apparently expressed a desire &quot;of spearing the governor whenever he saw him&quot;.

===Leader of the Kissing Point clan===
Despite the disparaging view the colonists held toward Bennelong, by the early 1800s he had become the leader of a 100-strong group of Aboriginal people, remnants of the dispossessed Port Jackson clans, living on the north side of the Parramatta River to the west of Kissing Point in Wallumedagal country. He was held in respect as an authoritative elder not only by his own group, but also by the remaining Gweagal people of Botany Bay.

== Death ==
He died on 3 January 1813 at Kissing Point on the Parramatta River in Sydney and was buried in the orchard of the brewer James Squire, a friend to Bennelong and his clan. His death notice in the &quot;Sydney Gazette&quot; was dismissive, insisting that &quot;he was a thorough savage, not to be warped from the form and character that nature gave him&quot;which reflected the feelings of some in Sydney&#x27;s white society that Bennelong had abandoned his role as ambassador in his last years, and also reflects the deteriorating relations between the two groups as more and more land was cleared and fenced for farming, and the hardening attitudes of many colonists towards &quot;savages&quot; who were not willing to give up their country and become labourers and servants useful to the colonists.

Bennelong&#x27;s people mourned his death with a traditional highly ritualised battle for which about two hundred people gathered. As a profound mark of respect, Colebee&#x27;s nephew Nanbaree, who died in 1821, asked to be buried with Bennelong. Bennelong&#x27;s final wife, Boorong, was also interred in the same gravesite. Bidgee Bidgee, who led the Kissing Point clan for twenty years after Bennelong&#x27;s death, asked to be buried with Bennelong as well, but there is no record of his death or of where he is buried.

On 20 March 2011, Peter Mitchell of Macquarie University announced that he had located Bennelong&#x27;s grave site under a residential property at present-day 25 Watson Street, Putney, New South Wales, and stated that local Aboriginal authorities would be consulted about possible further exploration of the site. In November 2018, the New South Wales Government announced that it had bought the house and would turn the site into a public memorial to Bennelong, together with a museum commemorating the impact of British colonisation on the Aboriginal people of the Sydney area.

== Family ==
Bennelong had several wives. The first, whose name is not known, died prior to his capture, probably from smallpox in 1789. He then married the widowed Cammeray clanswoman Barangaroo. Their daughter Dilboong died in infancy. Upon Barangaroo&#x27;s death in 1791, Bennelong cremated her remains in Arthur Phillip&#x27;s garden. Bennelong then abducted and took up with a Gweagal woman, Kurubarabulu. They stayed together a year until his departure for England. On his return, she had found another mate. Bennelong had a son named Dickey with his final wife, Boorong. Dickey was adopted by Anglican priest William Walker and christened as Thomas Walter Coke. Boorong was later buried with Bennelong when they had both died.

== Legacy ==
Bennelong&#x27;s legacy was long contested. Among many others, Manning Clark wrote: &quot;Bennelong disgusted his civilizers and became an exile from his own people.&quot; He was seen as a tragic figure, due to being &quot;caught between two worlds&quot; as well as due to the alcoholism he developed later in life. In recent decades, he has been defended, as someone who saw the best and worst of Western civilization and, having done so, rejected it, recreating a modified form of traditional lifestyle at Kissing Point. Bennelong has also been recognised as a warrior who could switch between the British and Aboriginal worlds, and use the colonists&#x27; desire for conciliation as an advantage to both himself and his people. His on-again, off-again friendship with the British governors ultimately saw other Aboriginal people being brought into contact with the colony at Sydney. In contributing to some of the first cross-cultural communication between the groups, he helped establish a tenuous peace between the Eora and the British that enabled some Aboriginal people to continue to exist as survivors in their own colonised land.
