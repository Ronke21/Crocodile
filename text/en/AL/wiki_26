<text>In category theory and its applications to mathematics, a biproduct of a finite collection of objects, in a category with zero objects, is both a product and a coproduct. In a preadditive category the notions of product and coproduct coincide for finite collections of objects. The biproduct is a generalization of finite direct sums of modules.

==Definition==

Let C be a category with zero morphisms. Given a finite (possibly empty) collection of objects &quot;A&quot;1, ..., &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot; in C, their &quot;biproduct&quot; is an object formula_1 in C together with morphisms 

*formula_2 in C (the &quot;projection morphisms&quot;)
*formula_3 (the &quot;embedding morphisms&quot;)
satisfying
*formula_4, the identity morphism of formula_5 and
*formula_6, the zero morphism formula_7 for formula_8
and such that
*formula_9 is a product for the formula_10 and
*formula_11 is a coproduct for the formula_12

If C is preadditive and the first two conditions hold, then each of the last two conditions is equivalent to formula_13 when &quot;n&quot; &gt; 0. An empty, or nullary, product is always a terminal object in the category, and the empty coproduct is always an initial object in the category. Thus an empty, or nullary, biproduct is always a zero object.

==Examples==

In the category of abelian groups, biproducts always exist and are given by the direct sum. The zero object is the trivial group.

Similarly, biproducts exist in the category of vector spaces over a field. The biproduct is again the direct sum, and the zero object is the trivial vector space.

More generally, biproducts exist in the category of modules over a ring.

On the other hand, biproducts do not exist in the category of groups. Here, the product is the direct product, but the coproduct is the free product.

Also, biproducts do not exist in the category of sets. For, the product is given by the Cartesian product, whereas the coproduct is given by the disjoint union. This category does not have a zero object.

Block matrix algebra relies upon biproducts in categories of matrices.

==Properties==

If the biproduct formula_14 exists for all pairs of objects &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; in the category C, and C has a zero object, then all finite biproducts exist, making C both a Cartesian monoidal category and a co-Cartesian monoidal category.

If the product formula_15 and coproduct formula_16 both exist for some pair of objects &quot;A&quot;1, &quot;A&quot;2 then there is a unique morphism formula_17 such that

*formula_18
*formula_19 for formula_20

It follows that the biproduct formula_21 exists if and only if &quot;f&quot; is an isomorphism.

If C is a preadditive category, then every finite product is a biproduct, and every finite coproduct is a biproduct. For example, if formula_15 exists, then there are unique morphisms formula_23 such that

*formula_24
*formula_25 for formula_20

To see that formula_15 is now also a coproduct, and hence a biproduct, suppose we have morphisms formula_28 for some object formula_29. Define formula_30 Then formula_31 is a morphism from formula_15 to formula_29, and formula_34 for formula_35.

In this case we always have
*formula_36

An additive category is a preadditive category in which all finite biproducts exist. In particular, biproducts always exist in abelian categories.

<text>Penang is a Malaysian state located on the northwest coast of Peninsular Malaysia along the Strait of Malacca. It has two parts: Penang Island, where the capital city, George Town, is located, and Seberang Perai on the Malay Peninsula. These two halves are physically connected by the Penang Bridge and the Second Penang Bridge. The state shares borders with Kedah to the north and east, and Perak to the south.

Penang is one of Malaysia&#x27;s most developed economic powerhouses, with the highest GDP per capita and Human Development Index of all states. It also ranks second among the states in terms of average wages. Penang is Malaysia&#x27;s leading exporter with over RM447 billion (US$ billion) in exports in 2023, primarily through the Penang International Airport which is also the nation&#x27;s third busiest.

Established by Francis Light in 1786, Penang became part of the Straits Settlements, a British crown colony also comprising Malacca and Singapore. During World War II, Japan occupied Penang, but the British regained control in 1945. Penang was later merged with the Federation of Malaya (now Malaysia), which gained independence in 1957. Penang&#x27;s economy shifted from entrep√¥t trade to electronics manufacturing and the tertiary sector throughout the late 20th century.

With 1.74 million residents and a population density of , Penang is one of Malaysia&#x27;s most densely populated and urbanised states. Seberang Perai is Malaysia&#x27;s third largest city by population. Penang is culturally diverse with a population that includes Chinese, Malays, Indians, Eurasians, Siamese and expatriates.

== Etymology ==
The name Penang comes from the modern Malay name &quot;Pulau Pinang&quot; which means &#x27;areca nut island&#x27;. Penang is also colloquially referred to as the &quot;Pearl of the Orient&quot; and &quot;The Island of Pearls&quot; ().

Over the course of history, Penang Island had been known by different names by seafarers from various regions. The locals named it &quot;Pulo Ka Satu&quot;, meaning &quot;The First Island&quot;, as it was the largest island on the maritime route between Lingga and Kedah. The Siamese, who were the overlords of Kedah, called it &quot;Ko Mak&quot; ().

Maritime explorers also took note of the island&#x27;s abundance of areca nut. During the 15th century, Admiral Zheng He of Ming China referred to the island as &quot;Bƒ´ngl√°ng Y«î&quot; () in his navigational charts. In the &quot;Description of Malacca&quot;, Portuguese cartographer Manuel Godinho de Er√©dia named it &quot;Pulo Pinaom&quot;.

== History ==
=== Early history ===
Archaeologists have discovered human remains such as the &quot;Penang Woman&quot;, along with seashells, pottery and stone tools, in Seberang Perai. The artefacts indicate that around 5,000 to 6,000 years ago, Penang was inhabited by nomadic Melanesians during the Neolithic era.

Pali inscriptions on the Cherok Tok Kun megalith suggest the Hindu-Buddhist Bujang Valley civilisation, based in present-day Kedah, held authority over parts of Seberang Perai by the 6th century. The entirety of Penang later formed part of Kedah, which came under Siamese suzerainty by the late 18th century.

=== Establishment and British rule ===

Penang&#x27;s modern history began in 1786 when Francis Light, a representative of the British East India Company (EIC), obtained Penang Island from Sultan Abdullah Mukarram Shah of Kedah in exchange for military aid. Light had been sent to the Malay Peninsula by the EIC to build trade relations in the region, where he saw the strategic potential of Penang Island as a &quot;convenient magazine for trade&quot; that could enable the British to check Dutch and French territorial ambitions in Southeast Asia.

After negotiating an agreement with the Sultan, Light and his entourage landed on Penang Island on 17 July that year and took formal possession of the island &quot;in the name of King George III of England&quot; on 11 August. The island was renamed Prince of Wales Island after the heir to the British throne and the new settlement of George Town was established in honour of King George III.

Unbeknownst to Sultan Abdullah, Light had acted without the authority or the consent of his superiors in India. When the EIC reneged on military protection, the Sultan launched an attempt to recapture the Prince of Wales Island in 1791. However, the attempt was defeated by EIC forces and the Sultan sued for peace. An annual payment of 6,000 Spanish dollars was agreed in exchange for British sovereignty over the island.

In 1800, Lieutenant-Governor George Leith secured a strip of hinterland across the Penang Strait, which was subsequently named Province Wellesley (now Seberang Perai). The EIC gained permanent sovereignty over both Prince of Wales Island and the new mainland territory, while the annual payment to the Sultan of Kedah was increased to 10,000 Spanish dollars. The British and Malaysian governments maintained the annual payments to Kedah until 2018, when the Malaysian federal government increased the amount by RM10 million yearly.
George Town grew rapidly as a free port and a conduit for spice trade, diverting maritime commerce away from Dutch outposts in the region. In 1805, Penang became a separate presidency of British India, sharing similar status with Bombay and Madras. By 1808, George Town had established its local government, while the founding of the Supreme Court of Penang marked the birth of Malaysia&#x27;s modern judiciary. In 1826, George Town was made the capital of the Straits Settlements which included Singapore and Malacca. As Singapore soon supplanted George Town as the region&#x27;s premier entrep√¥t, Singapore became the capital instead in 1832.

Despite its secondary importance to Singapore, George Town retained its importance as a vital British entrep√¥t. Towards the end of the 19th century, it became a major tin exporter and Malaya&#x27;s primary financial centre. Penang&#x27;s prosperity attracted a cosmopolitan population comprising Chinese, Malay, Indian, Peranakan, Siamese and migrants of mixed European-Asian lineage referred to as &quot;Eurasians&quot;, and led to the development of hitherto rural areas such as Butterworth and Bukit Mertajam. However, the population growth created social problems such as inadequate sanitation, health facilities and rampant crime, culminating in street violence and rioting in 1867.

The Straits Settlements became a British crown colony within the same year. Direct British rule led to improved law enforcement, and investments in health care and public transportation in Penang. Owing to enhanced access to education, active participation of Asian residents in municipal affairs and substantial press freedom, George Town was perceived as being more intellectually receptive than Singapore. The settlement attracted intellectuals and revolutionaries, including Rudyard Kipling, Somerset Maugham and Sun Yat-sen. In 1910, Sun selected George Town as the centre for the Tongmenghui&#x27;s political activities in Southeast Asia, aimed at overthrowing the Qing dynasty.

=== World wars ===
Penang emerged from World War I relatively unscathed, apart from the Battle of Penang during which the Imperial German Navy cruiser SMS &quot;Emden&quot; sank two Allied warships off George Town. During the interwar years, the British had acknowledged the need to fortify their armed forces in northern Malaya. However, complacency and lack of resources left British forces ill-prepared to confront the Japanese invasion at the onset of the Pacific War. Although Penang Island had been designated as a fortress, Penang fell without struggle to the Imperial Japanese Army on 19 December 1941 after daily aerial attacks. The British covertly evacuated Penang&#x27;s European populace; historian Raymond Callahan since contended that &quot;the moral collapse of British rule in Southeast Asia came not at Singapore, but at Penang&quot;.

Penang Island was subsequently renamed &quot;Tojo-to&quot; after Prime Minister Hideki Tojo. Japanese military police imposed order by massacring Chinese civilians under the Sook Ching policy, while women were forced into sexual slavery. Swettenham Pier was converted into a major submarine base by the Axis Powers.

Between 1944 and 1945, Allied bombers from India targeted naval and administrative buildings in George Town, damaging and destroying several colonial buildings in the process. The Penang Strait was mined to restrict Japanese shipping. Following Japan&#x27;s surrender, George Town was the first Malayan settlement liberated by British marines through Operation Jurist on 3 September 1945.

===Post-war years===
Penang was placed under British military administration until 1946, after which the Straits Settlements was abolished. The British sought to consolidate the various political entities in British Malaya, including the Crown Colony of Penang, under a single polity known as the Malayan Union. Initially, the impending annexation of Penang into the vast Malay heartland proved unpopular among Penangites. The Penang Secessionist Committee was formed in 1948 due to economic and ethnic concerns, but their attempt to avert Penang&#x27;s merger with Malaya was unsuccessful due to British disapproval.

To relieve the concerns raised by the secessionists, the British government guaranteed George Town&#x27;s free port status and reintroduced municipal elections in 1951. George Town became the first fully-elected municipality in Malaya by 1956 and was granted city status by Queen Elizabeth II in the following year. This made George Town the first city within the Federation of Malaya, and by extension, Malaysia.

=== Post-independence era ===
George Town&#x27;s status as a free port was rescinded by the Malaysian federal government in 1969. This led to a loss of maritime trade, causing massive unemployment and brain drain. To revive the economy, Chief Minister Lim Chong Eu established the Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone in 1972. Massive industrialisation proved instrumental in reversing Penang&#x27;s economic slump and led to the state&#x27;s rapid economic growth until the late 1990s. Under Lim&#x27;s tenure, the Penang Bridge, the first road link between Penang Island and the Malay Peninsula, was built.

Persistent brain drain, aggravated by federal policies prioritising the growth of Kuala Lumpur, resulted in Penang losing its leading position in the national economy by the 21st century. This decline, compounded by various issues including incoherent urban planning, poor traffic management and the dilapidation of George Town&#x27;s heritage enclave following the repeal of the Rent Control Act in 2001, contributed to growing dissatisfaction within Penang&#x27;s society.

In response, civil societies in George Town mobilised public support to rejuvenate the city. Resentment against the Barisan Nasional (BN) administration led to the Pakatan Rakyat bloc (now Pakatan Harapan) rising to power through the 2008 state election. Efforts to preserve George Town&#x27;s heritage architecture led to the city&#x27;s historical core being designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site that year.

==Governance and politics==


Penang, a former British crown colony, is one of the four Malaysian states without hereditary monarchies. The Constitution of Penang, codified in 1957, is the state&#x27;s highest law, consisting of 42 articles that govern the proceedings and powers of the state government. The head of state is the Governor (), who is appointed by the King of Malaysia. Ahmad Fuzi Abdul Razak is the current Governor of Penang, having assumed office in 2021. In practice, the Governor&#x27;s role is largely symbolic and ceremonial. This includes the authority to appoint the head of government and approve legislation that has been passed by the state&#x27;s legislature.

The Penang state government has its own executive body and legislature, but their powers are limited compared to the Malaysian federal government. According to the Federal Constitution, the state can legislate on matters pertaining to Malay customs, land, agriculture and forestry, local government, civil and water works, and state administration. Matters falling under the joint purview of state and federal authorities include social welfare, wildlife protection and national parks, scholarships, husbandry, town planning, drainage and irrigation, and public health regulations.

The 40-member Penang State Legislative Assembly forms the state&#x27;s legislature and is elected for a maximum term of five years from single-member constituencies through state elections. Compared to the rest of Peninsular Malaysia, Penang&#x27;s electoral landscape is perceived as being more liberal and distinct due to the state&#x27;s ethnic diversity and socio-economic development. Unlike other Peninsular states, ethnic Chinese have formed the plurality in Penang for decades, and the state&#x27;s economic infrastructure is based primarily on commerce and trade rather than agriculture. , non-Malays formed the majority in 25 of the 40 state constituencies. Thus, non-Malay electoral support is crucial to any political coalition aiming for power in Penang.

===Executive===
The Penang State Executive Council is the executive authority of the Penang state government, similar in function to the federal Cabinet. It is led by the Chief Minister, who serves as the head of government in Penang. To this day, Penang remains the only Malaysian state where the position of the head of government has been continuously held by an ethnic Chinese since the nation&#x27;s independence. Additionally, Penang was the first state to impose a two-term limit for the head of government&#x27;s tenure. The current Chief Minister of Penang is Chow Kon Yeow of the Democratic Action Party (DAP), having assumed office after the 2018 state election.
===Legislature===

The unicameral 40-seat Penang State Legislative Assembly, whose members are called State Assemblymen, convenes at the neoclassical State Assembly Building in George Town. Penang practises the Westminster system whereby the State Executive Council members are appointed from the elected State Assemblymen. Any amendment to Penang&#x27;s Constitution requires the support of at least two-thirds of the State Legislative Assembly. Prior to a state election, it is customary to dissolve the legislature, which necessitates the consent of the Governor.

The 2023 state election witnessed an unprecedented alliance between Pakatan Harapan (PH) and its erstwhile adversaries Barisan Nasional (BN). The PH‚ÄìBN alliance currently commands a supermajority in the State Legislative Assembly, controlling 29 out of the 40 seats. However, the election also saw the right-wing Perikatan Nasional (PN) opposition bloc gaining ground in the rural Malay-majority constituencies, occupying the remaining 11 seats in the legislature.

=== Local governments ===
Penang is further divided into two city-level municipalities, each administered by a local government. The local governments exercise power in areas such as planning and development control, public housing, public spaces, waste disposal, business licensing, markets, local transport, and municipal roads.
* The Penang Island City Council (MBPP) administers the city of George Town, which includes the entirety of Penang Island. It is made up of a mayor, a city secretary and 24 councillors.
* The Seberang Perai City Council (MBSP) is in charge of Seberang Perai. Similar in structure to the MBPP, it also consists of a mayor, a city secretary and 24 councillors.

Penang is also divided into five administrative districts two in George Town and three in Seberang Perai. Each district is headed by a district officer. The lands and district office in each district deals with land taxation, thus differing from local governments that manage urban administration and maintenance of infrastructure.

After Pakatan Rakyat was voted into power in 2008, the newly-elected state government attempted to reinstate local government elections within Penang, which have been suspended since the 1960s. At the time, the Barisan Nasional-controlled federal government objected to the move, which eventually led to the Federal Court&#x27;s decision that local government elections do not fall under the jurisdiction of state governments.

=== Judiciary ===

The present-day Malaysian judicial system traces its roots to 19th-century George Town. In 1807, Penang was granted a Royal Charter which paved the way for the establishment of a Supreme Court. In the following year, the Supreme Court of Penang (now Penang High Court) was inaugurated at Fort Cornwallis with the appointment of Edmond Stanley as the first Recorder.

The Penang High Court serves as the highest court in the state. Notable lawyers who served the high court include Tunku Abdul Rahman, Cecil Rajendra and Karpal Singh. There are also four Magistrates Courts and two Sessions Courts throughout Penang.

=== Foreign relations ===
Penang is home to the largest contingent of foreign diplomatic missions among Malaysian states. , a total of 27 countries have either established consulates or appointed honorary consuls within Penang. The Penang state government has also inked a sister state agreement with Japan&#x27;s Kanagawa Prefecture and a friendship state partnership with China&#x27;s Hainan Province.

==== Consulates ====
This list is based on information from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, unless otherwise cited.
=== Security ===

In 1861, the Penang and Province Wellesley Volunteer Corps (P&amp;PWVC) was established as the second volunteer military force in Malaya after the Singapore Volunteer Corps. Initially, the unit was exclusively formed by Europeans, with other races being barred until 1899. Over time, the P&amp;PWVC transformed into the 3rd Battalion of the Straits Settlements Volunteer Force (SSVF) and by 1937, the unit also contained a European machine gun platoon, a Malay rifle company, a medical section and headquarters reserve. Although enlistment increased prior to the Japanese invasion of Malaya, 3rd Battalion SSVF was eventually evacuated from Penang without engaging in any combat.

Since independence, the Malaysian federal government assumes sole responsibility for the country&#x27;s defence. Penang houses the Malaysian Army&#x27;s 2nd Battalion of the Royal Malay Regiment and Rejimen 509 Askar Wataniah, which traces its lineage back to the P&amp;PWVC. The Royal Malaysian Navy maintains a volunteer reserve base in George Town. RMAF Butterworth Air Base also serves as the headquarters of the Five Power Defence Arrangements Integrated Area Defence System (HQIADS). The air base continues to host Australian air force and army units on a rotational basis, including Rifle Company Butterworth.

==Geography==

With a land area of only , Penang is the second smallest state in Malaysia after Perlis. It is located on the northwestern coastline of Peninsular Malaysia, lying between latitudes 5.59¬∞ and 5.12¬∞N, and longitudes 100.17¬∞ and 100.56¬∞E. The state is divided into two major halves by the Penang Strait, which is only wide at the narrowest point and at its widest.
* Penang Island, a island.
* Seberang Perai, a hinterland on the Malay Peninsula. It shares land borders with Kedah to the north and east, and Perak to the south.
The state capital, George Town, encompasses the entirety of Penang Island and a few surrounding islets, including Jerejak, Betong, Kendi, Rimau and Andaman islands. On the other hand, the city of Seberang Perai covers the mainland side of Penang.
===Topography===

Penang Island is irregularly shaped, with a hilly and mostly forested interior. The island&#x27;s coastal plains are narrow, with the most extensive plain located at the northeastern cape. George Town, which started off as a small settlement at the northeastern tip of the island, has expanded over the centuries to encompass the entire island, although the marshy western coast remains relatively underdeveloped. The highest point of the state is Penang Hill, which stands at a height of at the centre of the island. On the other hand, Seberang Perai has mostly flat topography, save for a hilly region along the eastern border with Kedah.

Due to land scarcity in George Town, land reclamation projects have been undertaken at high-demand areas, particularly along the island&#x27;s east coast. In 2023, a massive reclamation project commenced off the city&#x27;s southern coast to build the Silicon Island, envisioned as a new hub for high-tech manufacturing and commerce. Following years of reclamation works, the Gurney Drive shoreline is also being transformed into Gurney Bay, intended as &quot;a new iconic waterfront destination for Penang&quot;.

The major rivers within Penang include the Pinang, Perai, Muda and Kerian rivers. The Muda River serves as the northern border between Seberang Perai and Kedah, while the Kerian River forms part of the southern boundary between Seberang Perai, Kedah and Perak.

===Climate===
Penang has a tropical rainforest climate under the K√∂ppen climate classification (&quot;Af&quot;). The state experiences relatively consistent temperatures throughout the course of the year, with an average high of about 32¬†¬∞C and an average low of 24¬∞C. Penang&#x27;s proximity to Sumatra makes it susceptible to dust particles carried by wind from transient forest fires that create the perennial Southeast Asian haze. The Penang Meteorological Office at Bayan Lepas is the primary weather forecast facility for northwestern Malaysia.
=== Nature ===
In spite of rapid urbanisation, Penang has managed to preserve a significant portion of its natural environment. Within the state, have been designated as protected forest reserves. In 2021, the Penang Hill Biosphere Reserve was designated a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in recognition of the area&#x27;s biodiversity. The gazetted nature reserve includes the Penang National Park, which covers of the northwestern tip of the island. It has been identified as one of the state&#x27;s ecotourism destinations, alongside the Penang Botanic Gardens and the Tropical Spice Garden.
== Economy ==


Despite its small size, Penang has one of the most robust economies in Malaysia. The state&#x27;s tertiary-based economy is largely driven by the manufacturing and services sectors. In 2023, Penang&#x27;s GDP was worth nearly RM128.593 billion (US$28.016 billion) with a growth rate of 3.3%. Penang&#x27;s GDP per capita of RM72,586 (US$15,814) was the highest among Malaysian states, surpassing the World Bank&#x27;s threshold of US$14,005 to be considered a high-income economy. In addition, the George Town Conurbation had a GDP worth US$30 billion in 2020, making it the second largest metropolitan economy in Malaysia after the Klang Valley.

Penang contributed approximately RM7 billion (US$ billion) of Malaysia&#x27;s yearly tax revenue and consistently records one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation at 2.2% . Average monthly salaries rose to RM3,557 (US$), the second highest among Malaysian states after Selangor, while labour force participation rate increased to 71.3% from 70.1% in the previous year.

Penang is the top destination in Malaysia for foreign investors, capturing US$13.4 billion or nearly 33% of the country&#x27;s inbound foreign direct investments (FDI) in 2023. , the bulk of Penang&#x27;s FDI originated from the Netherlands, Cayman Islands and Singapore. The state has also attracted hundreds of multinational corporations (MNCs) to its shores and plays a growing role in the global electronics supply chain, holding a share of more than 5% in the world&#x27;s semiconductor sales. Penang is concurrently Malaysia&#x27;s largest exporter, accounting for over RM447 billion (US$ billion) or 31% of the country&#x27;s exports in 2023. The services sector has been growing in tandem as well, with Penang being the second most popular hub in Malaysia for Global Business Services (GBS) and the financial heart of the country&#x27;s northwestern region, complemented by the state&#x27;s traditional popularity as a destination for tourism, business events and health care.

Penang&#x27;s economic renaissance, particularly since 2008, was described by Bloomberg as Malaysia&#x27;s &quot;biggest economic success&quot;, in spite of the federal government&#x27;s focus on other states such as Johor and Sarawak. The Penang state government has also managed to pare down public debt to RM41.1 million (US$ million) by 2022. In addition, Penang&#x27;s Human Development Index (HDI) value increased to 0.839 , the highest of all Malaysian states excluding the federal territories.

The booming economy has also led to a considerable interest in real estate in Penang. In 2016, George Town was ranked Malaysia&#x27;s most attractive destination for commercial property investment by Knight Frank, surpassing even Kuala Lumpur. In 2023, Penang&#x27;s residential market was ranked the second most popular in Southeast Asia after Singapore.

=== Manufacturing ===
In the early years following Malaya&#x27;s independence, Penang&#x27;s industrialisation efforts were limited to import substitution. This was when George Town still enjoyed its free port status. The first industrial estates were built in the 1960s at Mak Mandin and Perai during the tenure of Penang&#x27;s first Chief Minister Wong Pow Nee.

However, the revocation of George Town&#x27;s free port status and the fall of Wong&#x27;s administration in 1969 marked a turning point in Penang&#x27;s economic fortunes. Wong&#x27;s successor, Lim Chong Eu, initiated a massive transformation of Penang&#x27;s economy. The Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone (Bayan Lepas FIZ) in George Town was established in 1972, followed by the Perai Free Industrial Zone (Perai FIZ) in 1980. The zones played a critical role in reviving Penang&#x27;s economy and driving the state&#x27;s economic growth in the late 20th century. The Penang state government has since embarked on building newer industrial parks within Seberang Perai where land is more readily available, such as at Seberang Jaya, Bukit Minyak and Batu Kawan.

Penang&#x27;s manufacturing sector attracted US$13.1 billion of foreign direct investments (FDI) in 2023, accounting for almost 47% of Malaysia&#x27;s total that year. Among the hundreds of MNCs with manufacturing operations in Penang are technology firms such as AMD, Bosch, Broadcom, Dell, HP Inc., Intel, Motorola, Osram and Renesas. According to Financial Times in 2024, Penang is well-positioned to benefit from the ongoing China‚ÄìUnited States trade war, as restrictions push businesses to adopt the China Plus One strategy.

=== Services ===

The services sector contributed 48% of Penang&#x27;s GDP and employed almost of the state&#x27;s workforce. George Town is the commercial hub of northern Malaysia. , finance and ancillary services contributed 9% of Penang&#x27;s GDP. The Penang International Airport (PIA) is the country&#x27;s third busiest and in 2023, handled RM365 billion (US$ billion) worth of exports, the highest of all entry points nationwide. In 2024, the Port of Penang processed over 1.4 million TEUs of cargo, the third highest among Malaysia&#x27;s seaports.

Traditionally one of Malaysia&#x27;s most popular tourist destinations, Penang has embarked on economic diversification by expanding its tourism offerings in areas such as health care, business events, ecotourism and cruise arrivals. Penang is the leading destination in Malaysia for medical tourism, as well as the country&#x27;s second most popular destination for meetings, incentives, conferences and exhibitions (MICE) after Kuala Lumpur. The state&#x27;s retail sector is characterised by a diverse range of establishments, including modern shopping malls and traditional shophouses that specialise in local delicacies and produce.

Penang is also a major hub for shared services and outsourcing (SSO). By 2016, the state attracted RM4.1 billion of investments for global business services (GBS), the second largest share in the country after Kuala Lumpur. The offshore expansion of multinational firms to Penang has led to the creation of thousands of jobs and an increased demand for new office spaces within the state. In addition, Penang is home to a thriving startup community, driven by home-grown companies like Piktochart and DeliverEat.

==Utilities==
Water supply, which comes under the jurisdiction of the Penang state government, is wholly managed by the Penang Water Supply Corporation (PBAPP). The state enjoys the lowest domestic water tariff in Malaysia, at RM0.32 (US$) per 1,000 litres, but also records the highest domestic water consumption per capita in Malaysia at in 2018. Over 80% of Penang&#x27;s water supply comes from the Muda River, which forms the northern border between Seberang Perai and Kedah. This leaves the state vulnerable to effluents from upstream Kedah, as well as constant political disputes between the neighbouring states over the river. To counter water supply disruptions, PBAPP has contingency plans in place to draw water from alternative sources such as the Ayer Itam, Teluk Bahang and Mengkuang dams. The state government has also been negotiating with neighbouring Perak to secure additional water supply.

In 1904, George Town became the first city within British Malaya to be supplied with electricity. At present, electricity for industrial and domestic consumption is provided by Tenaga Nasional (TNB). In 2024, TNB built a RM500 million (US$ million) overhead power grid across the Penang Strait, boosting power transmission to George Town to 2,000 MW. Collaboration between TNB and the two city governments in Penang to replace existing street lighting with energy-efficient LED street lights is ongoing.

Municipal solid waste is disposed at the Pulau Burung landfill in Seberang Perai. The amount of solid waste generated in Penang has been steadily increasing over the years, from 838,365 metric tons in 2009 to 1,518,010 metric tons in 2019, with an average increase of 6.5%. However, Penang boasts the highest recycling rate in the country, standing at 47% . To streamline the waste management process, the two city governments reintroduced a waste sorting policy in 2024.

In 2020, Penang had become the first Malaysian state to require the installation of fibre-optic communication infrastructure for all development projects. , 5G coverage had reached 73.4% of the populated areas in the state. In 2024, DE-CIX inaugurated the Penang Internet Exchange (PIX), with internet traffic being routed through a data centre at Bayan Baru. State government agencies have been promoting the digital economy and intensifying efforts to attract high-value technology players to further boost the state&#x27;s economic growth.

==Transportation==

=== Land ===

Penang Island is physically connected to mainland Seberang Perai by two road bridges the Penang Bridge and the Second Penang Bridge. Seberang Perai is accessible through the North-South Expressway, a expressway that stretches along the western part of Peninsular Malaysia. Furthermore, the Keretapi Tanah Melayu (KTM) West Coast Line runs through the city, with the Butterworth railway station serving as the principal terminal in northwestern Malaysia. Aside from regular KTM services, Butterworth is also one of the main stops of the Eastern and Oriental Express service between Bangkok and Singapore. Penang Sentral is the main transit hub within Penang, located in close proximity to the Sultan Abdul Halim Ferry Terminal and the Butterworth railway station.

Within George Town, the Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway is a coastal highway that runs along the city&#x27;s eastern seaboard, connecting the city centre with the Penang Bridge, the Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone and the Second Penang Bridge. The Federal Route 6 is a pan-island trunk road that circles the city, while the George Town Inner Ring Road serves as the main thoroughfare within the city centre. Meanwhile, the major toll routes within Seberang Perai include the Butterworth Outer Ring Road (BORR) and the Butterworth-Kulim Expressway.

====Public transportation====

Under British rule, George Town was a pioneer in public transportation within Malaya. The city&#x27;s first tram system, originally powered by steam, began operations in the 1880s, but the trams became obsolete by 1936. The trishaw from the colonial era still plies the city&#x27;s streets, catering primarily to tourists.

Public buses form the backbone of public transportation in Penang. Established in 2007, Rapid Penang is the state&#x27;s main public transport operator, with 46 active routes throughout the George Town Conurbation including interstate routes into the neighbouring towns of Sungai Petani, Kulim and Kerian.

The only rail-based transportation system within Penang is the century-old Penang Hill Railway, a funicular service to the peak of Penang Hill. A cable car system is being constructed to reduce overreliance on the railway. The Penang state government has also planned to introduce urban rail throughout the state as part of the Penang Transport Master Plan. In 2024, the Malaysian federal government assumed control of the Mutiara LRT line from the state government. Spanning a distance of , the line is the first domestic light rail system outside the Klang Valley, and will link the cities of George Town and Seberang Perai. Construction commenced in 2025 and is expected to be complete by 2031.

To promote urban mobility, pedestrian and cycling infrastructure throughout the state are also being upgraded. In 2016, George Town became the first city in Malaysia to operate a public bicycle-sharing service with the inauguration of LinkBike.
===Air===
The Penang International Airport (PIA) is located south of downtown George Town. It serves as the main airport for northwestern Malaysia, with services to major regional cities such as Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Bangkok, Taipei, Hong Kong, Xiamen, Shanghai, Doha and Dubai. PIA is Malaysia&#x27;s third busiest airport in passenger traffic, recording more than 7.6 million passengers in 2024. It is also the country&#x27;s second busiest in terms of cargo tonnage and handles the largest export volume of all entry points nationwide. , the airport is being upgraded to raise its annual capacity from 6.5 million passengers to 12 million by 2028.

===Sea===

Formerly a vital British entrep√¥t, Penang&#x27;s maritime trade has significantly declined due to the loss of George Town&#x27;s free-port status in 1969 and the concurrent development of Port Klang near the federal capital Kuala Lumpur. Despite this, the Port of Penang remains the primary harbour for northwestern Malaysia and southern Thailand. It handled more than 1.4 million TEUs of cargo in 2024, the third highest among Malaysia&#x27;s seaports.

Swettenham Pier, situated within downtown George Town, accommodates cruise ships and is one of the major entry points into the city. In 2017, Swettenham Pier recorded 125 port calls, surpassing Port Klang as the busiest cruise shipping terminal in Malaysia. The pier has attracted some of the world&#x27;s largest cruise liners, such as the &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot;, and also sees occasional port visits by warships.

The cross-strait Penang ferry service connects George Town and Seberang Perai, and was formerly the only transportation link between the island city and the mainland until the completion of the Penang Bridge in 1985. At present, four ferries ply the Penang Strait between both cities daily.

== Demographics ==

The state is also home to a cosmopolitan mix of ethnic Eurasians, Siamese and Arabs.

Foreigners comprised 8% of Penang&#x27;s population in 2020. Over 38% of Penang&#x27;s expatriates resided within downtown George Town, Paya Terubong and Bayan Lepas. George Town&#x27;s affordable living costs, natural destinations, health care infrastructure, an established ecosystem of multinational companies (MNCs) and the widespread use of English have been cited as pull factors for expatriates.

===Languages===
Malay is the official language of Penang. English once served as the official language during British rule and recently there have been calls to reinstate it as one of Penang&#x27;s official languages. Tamil is the most widely spoken language among ethnic Indians, while Penang&#x27;s Chinese population uses a variety of Chinese dialects such as Teochew, Hakka and Cantonese.

Additionally, art exhibitions are held at the city&#x27;s event spaces like the Hin Bus Depot and Sia Boey.

Penang&#x27;s literary heritage stems from the colonial-era Peranakan Chinese literature and its role as a translation hub in Malaya, where prior to World War II, the publishing industry facilitated the translation of Chinese and Western literary works into Malay. Post-independence, the state&#x27;s literary scene has diversified, with independent local publishers and retailers such as Areca Books, Gerakbudaya and the George Town World Heritage Incorporated (GTWHI) running alongside major bookstore chains like Popular Holdings and MPH Group.

=== Media ===

George Town was once the hub of Malaysia&#x27;s print press. The nation&#x27;s first newspaper, the &quot;Prince of Wales Island Gazette&quot;, was founded in the city in 1806. Under British rule, Penang had relatively more press freedom as compared to Singapore, which had a stronger government apparatus.

Elsewhere within the city, Siamese and Burmese cultures are prominently displayed at places of worship such as Wat Chayamangkalaram, Dhammikarama Burmese Temple and Kek Lok Si.

Apart from the colonial-era architecture, George Town is home to most of Penang&#x27;s skyscrapers, including Komtar Tower, Marriott Residences and Muze @ PICC. There has been rising demand for residential high-rises at the suburbs since 2015, driven by the growing need for strata housing and the city&#x27;s thriving economy.

===Cuisine===

According to &quot;Time&quot; in 2004, only in the city &quot;could food this good be this cheap&quot;. Robin Barton of the &quot;Lonely Planet&quot; remarked that the city was a &quot;culinary epicentre of the many cultures that arrived after it was set up as a trading port in 1786, from Malays to Indians, Acehenese to Chinese, Burmese to Thais&quot;.

Over the years, Penang&#x27;s culinary scene has expanded to include fine dining establishments, adding to its already diverse street food options. In 2022, the &quot;Michelin Guide&quot; made its debut in the state, in recognition of its &quot;small-scale restaurants and street food that embodies Malaysia&#x27;s distinctive streetside dining culture&quot;. The 2025 edition of the &quot;Michelin Guide&quot; features 69 eateries throughout the state.

=== Sports ===

Despite its small size, Penang has hosted regional and international sporting events, such as the 2001 SEA Games, 2013 Women&#x27;s World Open Squash Championship and Asia&#x27;s first Masters Games in 2018. The state represents itself with its own sports teams in the interstate Sukma Games.

Penang is home to a variety of sports facilities. The Penang State Stadium in Seberang Perai is the state&#x27;s main stadium, while the City Stadium in George Town is the home ground of Penang FC.

<text>The Seven Sages or Seven Wise Men was the title given to seven philosophers, statesmen, and law-givers of the 7th‚Äì6th centuries BCE who were renowned for their wisdom.

==The Seven Sages==
The list of the seven sages given in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Protagoras&quot; comprises: 

* Thales of Miletus () is the first well-known Greek philosopher, mathematician, and astronomer. He was said to be of Phoenician descent. The ancient biographer Diogenes Laertius attributes the aphorism, &quot;Know thyself&quot;, engraved on the front facade of the Temple of Apollo in Delphi, to Thales, although there was no ancient consensus on this attribution.
* Pittacus of Mytilene () governed Mytilene (Lesbos). He tried to reduce the power of the nobility and was able to govern with the support of the common people, whom he favoured.
* Bias of Priene () was a politician and legislator of the 6th century BCE.
* Solon of Athens () was a famous legislator and reformer from Athens, framing the laws that shaped the Athenian democracy.
* Cleobulus, tyrant of Lindos (), reported as either the grandfather or father-in-law of Thales; 
* Myson of Chenae (6th century BCE); and
* Chilon of Sparta () was a Spartan politician to whom the militarization of Spartan society was attributed.

Diogenes La√´rtius points out, however, that there was among his sources great disagreement over which figures should be counted among the seven. Perhaps the two most common substitutions were to exchange Periander of Corinth or Anacharsis the Scythian for Myson. On Diogenes&#x27; first list of seven, which he introduces with the words &quot;These men are acknowledged wise&quot;, Periander appears instead of Myson; the same substitution appears in &quot;The Masque of the Seven Sages&quot; by Ausonius. Both Ephorus and Plutarch (in his &quot;Banquet of the Seven Sages&quot;) substituted Anacharsis for Myson. Diogenes La√´rtius further states that Dicaearchus gave ten possible names, Hippobotus suggested twelve names, and Hermippus enumerated seventeen possible sages from which different people made different selections of seven. Leslie Kurke contends that &quot;Aesop was a popular contender for inclusion in the group&quot;; an epigram of the 6th century CE poet Agathias (&quot;Palatine Anthology&quot; 16.332) refers to a statue of the Seven Sages, with Aesop standing before them.

== Interpretations ==
In Plato&#x27;s &quot;Protagoras&quot;, Socrates says:

The section of the &quot;Protagoras&quot; in which this passage appears is &quot;elaborately ironical&quot;, making it unclear which of its parts may be taken seriously.

Diogenes La√´rtius writes in his account of the life of Pyrrho, the founder of Pyrrhonism, that the Seven Sages of Greece were considered to be precursors of Pyrrho&#x27;s philosophical skepticism because the Delphic Maxims were skeptical. &quot;The maxims of the Seven Wise Men, too, they call skeptical; for instance, &#x27;Observe the Golden Mean&#x27;, and &#x27;A pledge is a curse at one&#x27;s elbow&#x27;, meaning that whoever plights his troth steadfastly and trustfully brings a curse on his own head.&quot;

== Sources and legends ==

The oldest explicit mention on record of a standard list of seven sages is in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Protagoras&quot;, quoted above.

Diogenes La√´rtius reported that there were seven individuals who were held in high esteem for their wisdom well before Plato&#x27;s time. According to Demetrius Phalereus, it was during the archonship of Damasias (582/81 BCE) that the seven first become known as &quot;the wise men&quot;, Thales being the first so acknowledged.

Later tradition ascribed to each sage a pithy saying of his own, but ancient as well as modern scholars have doubted the legitimacy of such ascriptions. A compilation of 147 maxims, inscribed at Delphi, was preserved by the fifth century CE scholar Stobaeus as &quot;Sayings of the Seven Sages&quot;, but &quot;the actual authorship of the¬†... maxims set up on the Delphian temple may be left uncertain. Most likely they were popular proverbs, which tended later to be attributed to particular sages.&quot;

In addition to being credited for pithy sayings, the wise men were also apparently famed for practical inventions; in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; (600a), it is said that it &quot;befits a wise man&quot; to have &quot;many inventions and useful devices in the crafts or sciences&quot; attributed to him, citing Thales and Anacharsis the Scythian as examples.

According to a number of moralistic stories, there was a golden tripod (or, in some versions of the story, a bowl or cup) which was to be given to the wisest. Allegedly, it passed in turn from one of the seven sages to another, beginning with Thales, until one of them (either Thales or Solon, depending on the story) finally dedicated it to Apollo who was held to be wisest of all.

According to Diogenes, Dicaearchus claimed that the seven &quot;were neither wise men nor philosophers, but merely shrewd men, who had studied legislation.&quot; And according to at least one modern scholar, the claim is correct: &quot;With the exception of Thales, no one whose life is contained in [Diogenes&#x27;] Book I [i.e. none of the above] has any claim to be styled a philosopher.&quot;

<doc id="59581" wikidata="Q875611" url="?curid=59581" title="Pledge of Allegiance">
<text>The Pledge of Allegiance is a patriotic recited verse that promises allegiance to the flag of the United States and the republic of the United States of America. The first version was written in 1885 by Captain George Thatcher Balch, a Union Army officer in the Civil War who later authored a book on how to teach patriotism to children in public schools. In 1892, Francis Bellamy revised Balch&#x27;s verse as part of a magazine promotion surrounding the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, which celebrated the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus&#x27; arrival in the Americas. Bellamy, the circulation manager for &quot;The Youth&#x27;s Companion&quot; magazine, helped persuade then-president Benjamin Harrison to institute Columbus Day as a national holiday and lobbied Congress for a national school celebration of the day. The magazine sent leaflets containing part of Bellamy&#x27;s Pledge of Allegiance to schools across the country and on October 21, 1892, over 10,000 children recited the verse together.

Bellamy&#x27;s version of the pledge is largely the same as the one formally adopted by Congress 50 years later, in 1942. The official name of &quot;The Pledge of Allegiance&quot; was adopted in 1945. The most recent alteration of its wording came on Flag Day (June 14) in 1954, when the words &quot;under God&quot; were added.

However, Bellamy&#x27;s authorship has been contested, as evidence has come out contradicting his claim.

==Recital==
Congressional sessions open with the recital of the Pledge, as do many government meetings at local levels, and meetings held by many private organizations. All states except Nebraska, Hawaii, Vermont, and Wyoming require a regularly scheduled recitation of the pledge in public schools. Many states give a variety of exemptions from reciting the pledge, such as California which requires a &quot;patriotic exercise&quot; every day, which would be satisfied by the Pledge, but it is not enforced. The Supreme Court has ruled in &quot;West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette&quot; that students cannot be compelled to recite the Pledge, nor can they be punished for not doing so. In several states, state flag pledges of allegiance are required to be recited after the pledge to the American flag.

The current United States Flag Code says:

== Origins ==
Historians point to surges in American patriotic oaths and pledges to the flag after the Civil War, when tensions surrounding political loyalties persisted, and in the 1880s, as rates of immigration increased dramatically.

=== Balch pledge ===
An early pledge was created in 1887 by Captain George T. Balch, a veteran of the Civil War, who later became auditor of the New York Board of Education. Balch&#x27;s pledge, which was recited contemporaneously with Bellamy&#x27;s until the 1923 National Flag Conference, read:

Balch was a proponent of teaching children, especially those of immigrants, loyalty to the United States, even going so far as to write a book on the subject and work with both the government and private organizations to distribute flags to every classroom and school. Balch&#x27;s pledge, which predates Francis Bellamy&#x27;s by five years and was embraced by many schools, by the Daughters of the American Revolution until the 1910s, and by the Grand Army of the Republic until the 1923 National Flag Conference, is often overlooked when discussing the history of the Pledge.

=== Bellamy pledge ===
The pledge that later evolved into the form used today was composed in August 1892 by Francis Bellamy (1855‚Äì1931) for the popular children&#x27;s magazine &quot;The Youth&#x27;s Companion&quot;. Francis Bellamy, who was a Baptist minister, a Christian socialist, and the cousin of Edward Bellamy (1850‚Äì1898), described the text of Balch&#x27;s pledge as &quot;too juvenile and lacking in dignity.&quot; The Bellamy &quot;Pledge of Allegiance&quot; was first published in the September 8, 1892, issue of &quot;The Youth&#x27;s Companion&quot; as part of the National Public-School Celebration of Columbus Day, a celebration of the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus&#x27;s arrival in the Americas. The event was conceived and promoted by James B. Upham, a marketer for the magazine, as a campaign to instill the idea of American nationalism in students and to encourage children to raise flags above their schools. According to author Margarette S. Miller, this campaign was in line both with Upham&#x27;s patriotic vision as well as with his commercial interest. According to Miller, Upham &quot;would often say to his wife: &#x27;Mary, if I can instill into the minds of our American youth a love for their country and the principles on which it was founded, and create in them an ambition to carry on with the ideals which the early founders wrote into The Constitution, I shall not have lived in vain. In 1957, Kenneth Keating instigated a report by Congress&#x27; Legislative Research Service that it was Francis Bellamy, and not James B. Upham, who authored the September 8, 1892, article; Keating represented New York&#x27;s 38th congressional district, which included Bellamy&#x27;s birthplace, Mount Morris.

Bellamy&#x27;s original Pledge :
The Pledge was supposed to be quick and to the point. Bellamy designed it to be recited in 15 seconds. As a socialist, he had initially also considered using the words &quot;equality&quot; and &quot;fraternity&quot; but decided against it.

Francis Bellamy and Upham had lined up the National Education Association to support the &quot;Youth&#x27;s Companion&quot; as a sponsor of the Columbus Day observance and the use in that observance of the American flag. By June 29, 1892, Bellamy and Upham had arranged for Congress and President Benjamin Harrison to announce a proclamation making the public school flag ceremony the center of the Columbus Day celebrations. This arrangement was formalized when Harrison issued Presidential Proclamation 335. Subsequently, the Pledge was first used in public schools on October 12, 1892, during Columbus Day observances organized to coincide with the opening of the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition (the Chicago World&#x27;s Fair), Illinois.

===Francis Bellamy&#x27;s account===
In his recollection of the creation of the Pledge, Francis Bellamy said, &quot;At the beginning of the nineties patriotism and national feeling was [sic] at a low ebb. The patriotic ardor of the Civil War was an old story¬†... The time was ripe for a reawakening of simple Americanism and the leaders in the new movement rightly felt that patriotic education should begin in the public schools.&quot; James Upham &quot;felt that a flag should be on every schoolhouse,&quot; so his publication &quot;fostered a plan of selling flags to schools through the children themselves at cost, which was so successful that 25,000 schools acquired flags in the first year (1892‚Äì93).

As the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition was set to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the arrival of Christopher Columbus in the Americas, Upham sought to link the publication&#x27;s flag drive to the event, &quot;so that every school in the land¬†... would have a flag raising, under the most impressive conditions.&quot; Bellamy was placed in charge of this operation and was soon lobbying &quot;not only the superintendents of education in all the States, but [he] also worked with governors, Congressmen, and even the President of the United States.&quot; The publication&#x27;s efforts paid off when Benjamin Harrison declared Wednesday, October 12, 1892, to be Columbus Day for which &quot;The Youth&#x27;s Companion&quot; made &quot;an official program for universal use in all the schools.&quot; Bellamy recalled that the event &quot;had to be more than a list of exercises. The ritual must be prepared with simplicity and dignity.&quot;

Edna Dean Proctor wrote an ode for the event: &quot;There was also an oration suitable for declamation.&quot; Bellamy held that &quot;Of course, the nub of the program was to be the raising of the flag, with a salute to the flag recited by the pupils in unison.&quot; He found &quot;There was not a satisfactory enough form for this salute. The Balch salute, which ran, &quot;I give my heart and my hand to my country, one country, one language, one flag,&quot; seemed to him too juvenile and lacking in dignity.&quot; After working on the idea with Upham, Bellamy concluded, &quot;It was my thought that a vow of loyalty or allegiance to the flag should be the dominant idea. I especially stressed the word &#x27;allegiance&#x27;. ...¬†Beginning with the new word allegiance, I first decided that &#x27;pledge&#x27; was a better school word than &#x27;vow&#x27; or &#x27;swear&#x27;; and that the first person singular should be used, and that &#x27;my&#x27; flag was preferable to &#x27;the. Bellamy considered the words &quot;country, nation, or Republic,&quot; choosing the last as &quot;it distinguished the form of government chosen by the founding fathers and established by the Revolution. The true reason for allegiance to the flag is the Republic for which it stands.&quot; Bellamy then reflected on the sayings of Revolutionary and Civil War figures, and concluded, &quot;All that pictured struggle reduced itself to three words, one Nation indivisible.&quot;

Bellamy considered the slogan of the French Revolution, (&quot;liberty, equality, fraternity&quot;), but held that &quot;fraternity was too remote of realization, and ‚Ä¶ [that] equality was a dubious word.&quot; Concluding &quot;Liberty and justice were surely basic, were undebatable, and were all that any one Nation could handle if they were exercised for all. They involved the spirit of equality and fraternity.&quot;

After being reviewed by Upham and other members of &quot;The Youth&#x27;s Companion&quot;, the Pledge was approved and put in the official Columbus Day program. Bellamy noted that &quot;in later years the words &#x27;to my flag&#x27; were changed to &#x27;to the flag of the United States of America&#x27; because of the large number of foreign children in the schools.&quot; Bellamy disliked the change, as &quot;it did injure the rhythmic balance of the original composition.&quot;

=== Contested Authorship of the Pledge ===
An alternative theory is that the pledge was submitted to an 1890 patriotic competition in &quot;The Youth&#x27;s Companion&quot; by a 13-year-old Kansas schoolboy, coincidentally named Frank E. Bellamy. A May 1892 newspaper from Hays, Kansas reported on an April 30 school flag-raising that was accompanied by an almost identical pledge. This ceremony would have taken place months before Francis supposedly created the pledge during August of that same year, according to his own testimony. The discovery was made by the noted amateur lexicographer Barry Popik, who collaborated with Fred Shapiro, an associate library director at the Yale School of Law. Shapiro previously attributed the pledge to Francis Bellamy in &quot;The Yale Book of Quotations&quot;, which he edits, but now regards Popik&#x27;s discovery as favoring Frank E. Bellamy rather than Francis Bellamy as the originator and intends to update future versions of the book to reflect this.

== Changes ==

In 1906, The Daughters of the American Revolution&#x27;s magazine, &quot;The American Monthly&quot;, used the following wording for the pledge of allegiance, based on Balch&#x27;s Pledge:

In subsequent publications of the Daughters of the American Revolution, such as in 1915&#x27;s &quot;Proceedings of the Twenty-Fourth Continental Congress of the Daughters of the American Revolution&quot; and 1916&#x27;s annual &quot;National Report,&quot; the previous pledge (adjusted to read &quot;I pledge my head, my hand, my heart...&quot;), listed as official in 1906, is now categorized as &quot;Old Pledge&quot; with Bellamy&#x27;s version under the heading &quot;New Pledge.&quot; The &quot;Old Pledge&quot; was still taken in other organizations until the National Flag Conference established uniform flag procedures in 1923.

In 1923, the National Flag Conference called for the words &quot;my Flag&quot; to be changed to &quot;the Flag of the United States,&quot; so that foreign-born people would not confuse loyalties between their birth countries and the US. The words &quot;of America&quot; were added a year later. Congress officially recognized the Pledge for the first time, in the following form, on June 22, 1942:

=== Addition of &quot;under God&quot; ===

Louis Albert Bowman, an attorney from Illinois, was the first to suggest the addition of &quot;under God&quot; to the pledge. The National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution gave him an Award of Merit as the originator of this idea. He spent his adult life in the Chicago area and was chaplain of the Illinois Society of the Sons of the American Revolution. At a meeting on February 12, 1948, he led the society in reciting the pledge with the two words &quot;under God&quot; added. He said that the words came from Lincoln&#x27;s Gettysburg Address. Although not all manuscript versions of the Gettysburg Address contain the words &quot;under God&quot;, all the reporters&#x27; transcripts of the speech as delivered do, as perhaps Lincoln may have deviated from his prepared text and inserted the phrase when he said &quot;that the nation shall, under God, have a new birth of freedom.&quot; Bowman repeated his revised version of the Pledge at other meetings.

During the Cold War era, many Americans wanted to distinguish the United States from the state atheism promoted by communist countries, a view that led to support for the words &quot;under God&quot; to be added to the Pledge of Allegiance.

In 1951, the Knights of Columbus, the world&#x27;s largest Catholic fraternal service organization, also began including the words &quot;under God&quot; in the Pledge of Allegiance. In New York City, on April 30, 1951, the board of directors of the Knights of Columbus adopted a resolution to amend the text of their Pledge of Allegiance at the opening of each of the meetings of the 800 Fourth Degree Assemblies of the Knights of Columbus by addition of the words &quot;under God&quot; after the words &quot;one nation.&quot; Over the next two years, the idea spread throughout Knights of Columbus organizations nationwide. On August 21, 1952, the Supreme Council of the Knights of Columbus at its annual meeting adopted a resolution urging that the change be made universal, and copies of this resolution were sent to the President, the Vice President (as Presiding Officer of the Senate), and the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The National Fraternal Congress meeting in Boston on September 24, 1952, adopted a similar resolution upon the recommendation of its president, Supreme Knight Luke E. Hart. Several State Fraternal Congresses acted likewise almost immediately thereafter. This campaign led to several official attempts to prompt Congress to adopt the Knights of Columbus policy for the entire nation. These attempts were eventually a success.

At the suggestion of a correspondent, Representative Louis C. Rabaut (D‚ÄìMI), sponsored a resolution to add the words &quot;under God&quot; to the Pledge in 1953.

Before February 1954, no endeavor to get the pledge officially amended had succeeded. The final successful push came from George MacPherson Docherty. Some American presidents honored Lincoln&#x27;s birthday by attending services at the church Lincoln attended, New York Avenue Presbyterian Church by sitting in Lincoln&#x27;s pew on the Sunday nearest February 12. On February 7, 1954, with President Dwight D. Eisenhower sitting in Lincoln&#x27;s pew, Docherty, the church&#x27;s pastor, delivered a sermon based on the Gettysburg Address entitled &quot;A New Birth of Freedom.&quot; He argued that the nation&#x27;s might lay not in arms but rather in its spirit and higher purpose. He noted that the Pledge&#x27;s sentiments could be those of any nation: &quot;There was something missing in the pledge, and that which was missing was the characteristic and definitive factor in the American way of life.&quot; He cited Lincoln&#x27;s words &quot;under God&quot; as defining words that set the US apart from other nations.

President Eisenhower had been baptized a Presbyterian very recently, just a year before. He responded enthusiastically to Docherty in a conversation following the service. Eisenhower acted on his suggestion the next day and on February 8, 1954, Rep. Charles Oakman (R‚ÄìMI), introduced a bill to that effect. Congress passed the necessary legislation and Eisenhower signed the bill into law on Flag Day, June 14, 1954. Eisenhower said:

The phrase &quot;under God&quot; was incorporated into the Pledge of Allegiance on June 14, 1954, by a Joint Resolution of Congress amending ¬ß¬†4 of the Flag Code enacted in 1942.

On October 6, 1954, the National Executive Committee of the American Legion adopted a resolution, first approved by the Illinois American Legion Convention in August 1954, which formally recognized the Knights of Columbus for having initiated and brought forward the amendment to the Pledge of Allegiance.

== Salute ==
Swearing of the Pledge is accompanied by a salute. An early version of the salute, adopted in 1887, accompanied the Balch pledge and was known as the Balch Salute. This salute instructed students to stand with their right hand outstretched toward the flag, the fingers of which are then brought to the forehead, followed by being placed flat over the heart, and finally falling to the side.

In 1892, Francis Bellamy created what was known as the Bellamy salute to accompany his own version of the Pledge of Allegiance. It started with the hand outstretched toward the flag, palm down, and ended with the palm up. Many decades later, during World War II, controversy arose because of the similarity between the Bellamy salute and the Nazi salute, which was adopted in Germany in the 1930s (although, unlike the Bellamy salute, this one did not end with the palm up). As a result, the US Congress stipulated that the hand-over-the-heart gesture would instead be rendered by civilians during the Pledge of Allegiance and the national anthem, thereby replacing the Bellamy salute. Removal of the Bellamy salute occurred on December 22, 1942, when Congress amended the Flag Code language first passed into law on June 22, 1942. Attached to bills passed in Congress in 2008 and then in 2009 (Section 301(b)(1) of title 36, United States Code), language was included which authorized all active duty military personnel and all veterans in civilian clothes to render a proper hand salute during the raising and lowering of the flag, when the colors are presented, and during the National Anthem.

Sarah Churchwell has argued that the term &quot;salute&quot;, as it relates to the Bellamy and Balch salutes, historically referred to the words of the pledges themselves, not a physical gesture.

== Music ==
A musical setting for &quot;The Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag&quot; was created by Irving Caesar, at the suggestion of Congressman Louis C. Rabaut whose House Resolution 243 to add the phrase &quot;under God&quot; was signed into law on Flag Day, June 14, 1954.

The composer Irving Caesar wrote and published over 700 songs in his lifetime. Dedicated to social issues, he donated all rights of the musical setting to the U.S. government, so that anyone can perform the piece without owing royalties.

It was sung for the first time on the floor of the House of Representatives on Flag Day, June 14, 1955, by the official Air Force choral group the &quot;Singing Sergeants&quot;. A July 29, 1955, House and Senate resolution authorized the U.S. Government Printing Office to print and distribute the song sheet together with a history of the pledge.

Other musical versions of the Pledge have since been copyrighted, including by Beck (2003), Lovrekovich (2002 and 2001), Roton (1991), Fijol (1986), and Girardet (1983).

== Controversy ==

In 1940, the Supreme Court, in &quot;Minersville School District v. Gobitis&quot;, ruled that students in public schools, including the respondents in that case‚ÄîJehovah&#x27;s Witnesses who considered the flag salute to be idolatry‚Äîcould be compelled to swear the Pledge. In 1943, in &quot;West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette&quot;, the Supreme Court reversed its decision. Justice Robert H. Jackson, writing for the 6 to 3 majority, went beyond simply ruling in the precise matter presented by the case to say that public school students are not required to say the Pledge on narrow grounds, and asserted that such ideological dogmata are antithetical to the principles of the country, concluding with:

In 2004, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals held that students are also not required to stand for the Pledge.
Requiring or promoting of the Pledge on the part of the government has continued to draw criticism and legal challenges on several grounds.

One objection is that a constitutional republic built on freedom of dissent should not require its citizens to pledge allegiance to it, and that the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the right to refrain from speaking or standing, which itself is also a form of speech in the context of the ritual of pledging allegiance. Another objection is that the people who are most likely to recite the Pledge every day, small children in schools, cannot really give their consent or even completely understand the Pledge they are making. Another criticism is the belief that a government requiring or promoting the phrase &quot;under God&quot; violates protections against the establishment of religion guaranteed in the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.

In 2004, linguist Geoffrey Nunberg said the original supporters of the addition thought that they were simply quoting Lincoln&#x27;s Gettysburg Address, but to Lincoln and his contemporaries, &quot;under God&quot; meant &quot;God willing&quot;, so they would have found its use in the Pledge of Allegiance grammatically incorrect and semantically odd.

In popular culture, the pledge has been mocked or altered by several movies and television series including, but not limited to, the Simpsons&#x27; inscription above the Springfield county courthouse&#x27;s door of &quot;Liberty and Justice for Most&quot;, first appearing in the twelfth episode of the series in 1990.

=== Legal challenges ===
Prominent legal challenges were brought in the 1930s and 1940s by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, a denomination whose beliefs preclude swearing loyalty to any power other than God, and who objected to policies in public schools requiring students to swear an oath to the flag. They said requiring the pledge violated their freedom of religion guaranteed by the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment. The first case was in 1935, when two children, Lillian and William Gobitis, ages ten and twelve, were expelled from the Minersville, Pennsylvania, public schools that year for failing to salute the flag and recite the Pledge of Allegiance. The issue was finally settled in favor of the Witnesses by the 1943 Supreme Court ruling, &quot;West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette&quot;.

In a 2002 case brought by atheist Michael Newdow, whose daughter was being taught the Pledge in school, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the phrase &quot;under God&quot; an unconstitutional endorsement of monotheism when the Pledge was promoted in public school. In 2004, the Supreme Court heard &quot;Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow&quot;, an appeal of the ruling, and rejected Newdow&#x27;s claim on the grounds that he was not the custodial parent, and therefore lacked standing, thus avoiding ruling on the merits of whether the phrase was constitutional in a school-sponsored recitation. On January 3, 2005, a new suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of California on behalf of three unnamed families. On September 14, 2005, District Court Judge Lawrence Karlton ruled in their favor. Citing the precedent of the 2002 ruling by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Karlton issued an order stating that, upon proper motion, he would enjoin the school district defendants from continuing their practices of leading children in pledging allegiance to &quot;one Nation under God.&quot;

In 2006, in the Florida case &quot;Frazier v. Alexandre&quot;, a federal district court in Florida ruled that a 1942 state law requiring students to stand and recite the Pledge of Allegiance violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. As a result of that decision, a Florida school district was ordered to pay $32,500 to a student who chose not to say the pledge and was ridiculed and called &quot;unpatriotic&quot; by a teacher.

In 2009, a Montgomery County, Maryland, teacher berated and had school police remove a 13-year-old girl who refused to say the Pledge of Allegiance in the classroom. The student&#x27;s mother, assisted by the American Civil Liberties Union of Maryland, sought and received an apology from the teacher, as state law and the school&#x27;s student handbook both prohibit students from being forced to recite the Pledge.

On March 11, 2010, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the words &quot;under God&quot; in the Pledge of Allegiance in the case of &quot;Newdow v. Rio Linda Union School District&quot;. In a 2‚Äì1 decision, the appellate court ruled that the words were of a &quot;ceremonial and patriotic nature&quot; and did not constitute an establishment of religion. Judge Stephen Reinhardt dissented, writing that &quot;the state-directed, teacher-led daily recitation in public schools of the amended &#x27;under God&#x27; version of the Pledge of Allegiance... violates the Establishment Clause of the Constitution.&quot;

On November 12, 2010, in a unanimous decision, the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston affirmed a ruling by a New Hampshire lower federal court which found that the pledge&#x27;s reference to God does not violate non-pledging students&#x27; rights if student participation in the pledge is voluntary. A United States Supreme Court appeal of this decision was denied on June 13, 2011.

In September 2013, a case was brought before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, arguing that the pledge violates the Equal Rights Amendment of the Constitution of Massachusetts. In May 2014, Massachusetts&#x27; highest court ruled that the pledge does not discriminate against atheists, saying that the words &quot;under God&quot; represent a patriotic, not a religious, exercise.

In February 2015 New Jersey Superior Court Judge David F. Bauman dismissed a lawsuit, ruling that &quot;‚Ä¶ the Pledge of Allegiance does not violate the rights of those who don&#x27;t believe in God and does not have to be removed from the patriotic message.&quot; The case against the Matawan-Aberdeen Regional School District had been brought by a student of the district and the American Humanist Association that argued that the phrase &quot;under God&quot; in the pledge created a climate of discrimination because it promoted religion, making non-believers &quot;second-class citizens.&quot; In a 21-page decision, Bauman wrote, &quot;Under [the association members&#x27;] reasoning, the very constitution under which [the members] seek redress for perceived atheistic marginalization could itself be deemed unconstitutional, an absurd proposition which [association members] do not and cannot advance here.&quot; Bauman said the student could skip the pledge, but upheld a New Jersey law that says pupils must recite the pledge unless they have &quot;conscientious scruples&quot; that do not allow it. He noted, &quot;As a matter of historical tradition, the words &#x27;under God&#x27; can no more be expunged from the national consciousness than the words &#x27;In God We Trust&#x27; from every coin in the land, than the words &#x27;so help me God&#x27; from every presidential oath since 1789, or than the prayer that has opened every congressional session of legislative business since 1787.&quot;

<text>Bilbo Baggins (Westron: &quot;Bilba Labingi&quot;) is the title character and protagonist of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s 1937 novel &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, a supporting character in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and the fictional narrator (along with Frodo Baggins) of many of Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth writings. The Hobbit is selected by the wizard Gandalf to help Thorin and his party of Dwarves reclaim their ancestral home and treasure, which has been seized by the dragon Smaug. Bilbo sets out in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; timid and comfort-loving and, through his adventures, grows to become a useful and resourceful member of the quest.

Bilbo&#x27;s way of life in the Shire, defined by features like the availability of tobacco and postal service, recalls that of the English middle class during the Victorian to Edwardian eras. This is not compatible with the much older world of Dwarves and Elves. Tolkien appears to have based Bilbo on the designer William Morris&#x27;s travels in Iceland; Morris liked his home comforts but grew through his adventurous journeying. Bilbo&#x27;s quest has been interpreted as a &quot;pilgrimage of grace&quot;, in which he grows in wisdom and virtue, and as a psychological journey towards wholeness.

Bilbo has appeared in numerous radio and film adaptations of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, and video games based on them.

==Appearances==

===&quot;The Hobbit&quot;===
The protagonist of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Bilbo Baggins, is a hobbit in comfortable middle age. He is hired as a &quot;burglar&quot;, despite his initial objections, on the recommendation of the wizard Gandalf and 13 Dwarves led by their king in exile, Thorin Oakenshield. The company of dwarves are on a quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain and its treasures from the dragon Smaug. The adventure takes Bilbo and his companions through the wilderness, to the elves haven, Rivendell, across the Misty Mountains where, escaping from goblins, he meets Gollum and acquires a magic ring. His journey continues via a lucky escape from wargs, goblins, and fire, to the house of Beorn the shapeshifter, through the black forest of Mirkwood, to Lake-town in the middle of Long Lake, and eventually to the Mountain itself.

As burglar, Bilbo is sent down the secret passage to the dragon&#x27;s lair. He steals a golden cup and takes it back to the Dwarves. Smaug awakes and instantly notices the theft and a draught of cold air from the opened passage. He flies out, nearly catches the Dwarves outside the door, and eats their ponies. Bilbo and the Dwarves hide inside the passage. Bilbo goes down to Smaug&#x27;s lair again to steal some more, but the dragon is now only half-asleep. Wearing his magic ring, Bilbo is invisible, but Smaug at once smells him. Bilbo has a riddling conversation with Smaug, and notices that the dragon&#x27;s armour does indeed have a gap. He escapes the dragon&#x27;s flames as he runs up the passage, and tells the Dwarves about the gap in Smaug&#x27;s armour. An old thrush hears what he says, and flies off to tell Bard in Lake-town.

Smaug realizes that Lake-town must have helped Bilbo, and flies off in a rage to destroy the town. The Dwarves and Bilbo hear that Smaug has been killed in the attack. The Dwarves reclaim the Lonely Mountain, and horrify Bilbo by refusing to share the dragon&#x27;s treasure with the lake-men or the wood-elves. Bilbo finds the Arkenstone of Thrain, the most precious heirloom of Thorin&#x27;s family, but hides it. Thorin calls his relative D√°in to bring an army of Dwarves. Thorin and his dwarves fortify the entrance to the mountain hall, and are besieged by the Wood-elves and Lake-men. Bilbo tries to ransom the Arkenstone to prevent fighting, but Thorin sees his action as betrayal, and banishes Bilbo. Dain arrives, and the army of Dwarves faces off against the armies of Elves and Men. As battle is joined, a host of goblins and wargs arrive to take over the mountain, now that Smaug is dead. The armies of Elves, Men, and Dwarves, with the help of Eagles and Beorn, defeat the goblins and wargs. Thorin is fatally wounded, but has time to make peace with Bilbo. Bilbo accepts only a little of the treasure which was his share, though it still represents great wealth for a Shire hobbit. Bilbo returns to his home in the Shire to find that several of his relatives, believing him to be dead, are trying to claim his home and possessions.

=== &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; ===

&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; begins with Bilbo&#x27;s &quot;eleventy-first&quot; (111th) birthday, 60¬†years after the beginning of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;. The main character of the novel is Frodo Baggins, Bilbo&#x27;s cousin, who celebrates his 33rd¬†birthday and legally comes of age on the same day. Bilbo has kept the magic ring, with no idea of its significance, all that time; it has prolonged his life, leaving him feeling &quot;thin and stretched&quot;. At the party, Bilbo tries to leave with the ring, but Gandalf persuades him to leave it behind for Frodo. Bilbo travels to Rivendell and visits the dwarves of the Lonely Mountain before returning to retire at Rivendell and write books. Gandalf discovers that Bilbo&#x27;s magic ring is the One Ring forged by the Dark Lord Sauron, and sets in motion the quest to destroy it. Frodo and his friends set off on the quest, finding Bilbo, now obviously old, but spry, in Rivendell. When they have destroyed the Ring, they return to the Shire, via Rivendell, where Bilbo looks &quot;very old, but peaceful, and sleepy&quot;. Two years later Bilbo accompanies Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, and Frodo to the Grey Havens, there to board ship bound for Tol Eress√´a across the sea.

=== Narrator ===
In Tolkien&#x27;s narrative conceit, in which all the writings of Middle-earth are translations from the fictitious volume of the &quot;Red Book of Westmarch&quot;, Bilbo is the author of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, translator of various &quot;works from the elvish&quot;, and the author of the following poems and songs:

* &quot;A Walking Song&quot;
* &quot;All that is gold does not glitter&quot;, based on Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, which uses &quot;glisters&quot; instead of &quot;glitters&quot;
* &quot;The Man in the Moon Stayed Up Too Late&quot;, adapted from the nursery rhyme &quot;Hey Diddle Diddle&quot;, supposedly as its ancestral form
* &quot;The Road Goes Ever On&quot;
* &quot;Bilbo&#x27;s Last Song&quot;, describing Bilbo&#x27;s contemplation of his forthcoming voyage to the Undying Lands.

== Interpretations ==

=== Name ===

The philologist and Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey notes that &quot;Baggins&quot; is close to the spoken words &quot;b√¶ggin&quot;, &quot;b√¶gginz&quot; in the dialect of Huddersfield, Yorkshire. where it means a substantial meal eaten between main meals, most particularly at teatime in the afternoon; and Mr Baggins is definitely, Shippey writes, &quot;partial to¬†... his tea&quot;. Tolkien worked in Yorkshire early in his career, at the University of Leeds; from 1920 he was a reader in the school of English studies, and he rose to become a full professor there. More specifically, he wrote the foreword to Walter E. Haigh&#x27;s 1928 &quot;A new glossary of the dialect of the Huddersfield district&quot;, which included these spoken words. 

In addition, &quot;Baggins&quot;, while not a name by etymology, sounds very much like one of a class of English surnames such as Dickens, Jenkins, and Huggins. These names, Shippey notes, are formed from personal names, in the diminutive form; and Tolkien uses Huggins as the name of one of the Trolls in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;.

Tolkien&#x27;s choice of the surname Baggins may be connected to the name of Bilbo&#x27;s house, Bag End, also the actual name of Tolkien&#x27;s aunt&#x27;s farmhouse, which Shippey notes was at the bottom of a lane with no exit. This is called a &quot;&quot; in England; Shippey describes this as &quot;a silly phrase&quot;, a piece of &quot;French-oriented snobbery&quot;. 

Shippey observes that the socially aspiring Sackville-Bagginses have similarly attempted to &quot;Frenchify&quot; their family name, &quot;Sac[k]-ville&quot; = &quot;Bag Town&quot;, as a mark of their bourgeois status. The journalist Matthew Dennison, writing for St Martin&#x27;s Press, calls Lobelia Sackville-Baggins &quot;Tolken&#x27;s unmistakable nod to Vita Sackville-West&quot;, an aristocratic novelist and gardening columnist as passionately attached to her family home, Knole House, which she was unable to inherit, as Lobelia was to Bag End. The opposite of a bourgeois is a burglar who breaks into bourgeois houses, and in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; Bilbo is asked to become a burglar (of Smaug the dragon&#x27;s lair), Shippey writes, showing that the Bagginses and the Sackville-Bagginses are &quot;connected opposites&quot;. He comments that the name Sackville-Baggins, for the snobbish branch of the Baggins family, is &quot;an anomaly in Middle-earth and a failure of tone&quot;.

===Period===

Bilbo&#x27;s distinctly anachronistic period, compared to the characters he meets, can be defined, Shippey notes, by the presence of tobacco, brought to Europe in 1559, and a postal service, introduced in England in 1840. Like Tolkien himself, Bilbo was &quot;English, middle class; and roughly Victorian to Edwardian&quot;, something that as Shippey observes, does not belong to the much older world of elves, dwarves, and wizards.

===Character===


Marjorie Burns, a medievalist, writes that Bilbo&#x27;s character and adventures match the fantasy writer and designer William Morris&#x27;s account of his travels in Iceland in the early 1870s in numerous details. Like Bilbo&#x27;s, Morris&#x27;s party set off enjoyably into the wild on ponies. He meets a &quot;boisterous&quot; man called &quot;Biorn the boaster&quot; who lives in a hall beside Eyja-fell, and who tells Morris, tapping him on the belly, &quot;...¬†besides, you know you are so fat&quot;, just as Beorn pokes Bilbo &quot;most disrespectfully&quot; and compares him to a plump rabbit. Burns notes that Morris was &quot;relatively short, a little rotund, and affectionately called &#x27;Topsy&#x27;, for his curly mop of hair&quot;, all somewhat hobbit-like characteristics. Further, she writes, &quot;Morris in Iceland often chooses to place himself in a comic light and to exaggerate his own ineptitude&quot;, just as Morris&#x27;s companion, the painter Edward Burne-Jones, gently teased his friend by depicting him as very fat in his Iceland cartoons. Burns suggests that these images &quot;make excellent models&quot; for the Bilbo who runs puffing to the Green Dragon inn or &quot;jogs along behind Gandalf and the dwarves&quot; on his quest. Another definite resemblance is the emphasis on home comforts: Morris enjoyed a pipe, a bath, and &quot;regular, well-cooked meals&quot;; Morris looked as out of place in Iceland as Bilbo did &quot;over the Edge of the Wild&quot;; both are afraid of dark caves; and both grow through their adventures.

===Quest===
The Christian writer Joseph Pearce describes &quot;The Hobbit&quot; as &quot;a pilgrimage of grace, in which its protagonist, Bilbo Baggins, becomes grown up ... in wisdom and virtue&quot;. Dorothy Matthews sees the story rather as a psychological journey, the anti-heroic Bilbo being willing to face challenges while firmly continuing to love home and discovering himself. Along the way, Matthews sees Jungian archetypes, talismans, and symbols at every turn: the Jungian wise old man Gandalf; the devouring mother of the giant spider, not to mention Gollum&#x27;s &quot;long grasping fingers&quot;; the Jungian circle of the self, the ring; the escape from the dark underground imprisoning chambers of the wood-elves and Bilbo&#x27;s symbolic rebirth into the sunlight and the waters of the woodland river; and the dragon guarding the contested treasure, itself &quot;an archetype of the self, of psychic wholeness&quot;. Later research has extended Matthews&#x27; analysis using alternative psychological frameworks such as Erik Erikson&#x27;s theory of development.

=== Genealogy ===
The Tolkien scholar Jason Fisher notes that Tolkien stated that hobbits were extremely &quot;clannish&quot; and had strong &quot;predilections for genealogy&quot;. Accordingly, Tolkien&#x27;s decision to include the Baggins and other hobbit family trees in &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; gives the book, in Fisher&#x27;s view, a strongly &quot;hobbitish perspective&quot;. The tree also, he notes, serves to show Bilbo&#x27;s and Frodo&#x27;s connections and familial characteristics, including that Bilbo was both &quot;a Baggins and a Took&quot;. Fisher observes that Bilbo is, like Aragorn: a &quot;distillation of the best of two families&quot;; he notes that in the game &quot;The Quest of Erebor&quot;, Gandalf is given the (non-Tolkien) lines &quot;So naturally, thinking over the hobbits that I knew, I said to myself, &#x27;I want a dash of the [adventurous] Took ... and I want a good foundation of the stolider sort, a Baggins perhaps.&#x27; That pointed at once to Bilbo&quot;.

The Tolkien critic Tom Shippey notes that Tolkien was very interested in such names, describing Shire names at length in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; &quot;Appendix F&quot;. One category was the names that meant nothing to the hobbits &quot;in their daily language&quot;, like Bilbo and Bungo; a few of these, like Otho and Drogo in the family tree, were &quot;by accident, the same as modern English names&quot;.

== Adaptations ==

In the 1955‚Äì1956 BBC Radio serialization of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Bilbo was played by Felix Felton. In the 1968 BBC Radio serialization of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Bilbo was played by Paul Daneman.

The 1969 parody &quot;Bored of the Rings&quot; by &quot;Harvard Lampoon&quot; (i.e. its co-founders Douglas Kenney and Henry Beard) modifies the hobbit&#x27;s name to &quot;Dildo Bugger&quot;.

In the 1977 Rankin/Bass animated version of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, Bilbo was voiced by Orson Bean. Bean also voiced both the aged Bilbo and Frodo in the same company&#x27;s 1980 adaptation of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;.

The 1976 Russian translation of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was illustrated with drawings by Mikhail Belomlinsky; he based his Bilbo character on the actor Yevgeny Leonov, who he described as &quot;good-natured, plump, with hairy legs&quot;.

In Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s 1978 animated version of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Bilbo was voiced by Norman Bird. Billy Barty was the model for Bilbo in the live-action recordings Bakshi used for rotoscoping. The 3000th story to be broadcast in the BBC&#x27;s long-running children&#x27;s programme Jackanory was &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, in 1979. Four narrators told the story with Bilbo&#x27;s part being played by Bernard Cribbins.

In the BBC&#x27;s 1981 radio serialization of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Bilbo is played by John Le Mesurier. In the unlicensed 1985 Soviet version on the Leningrad TV channel, &quot;–•–æ–±–±–∏—Ç–∞&quot; (&quot;The Hobbit&quot;), Bilbo was played by . In the 1993 television miniseries &quot;Hobitit&quot; by Finnish broadcaster Yle, Bilbo is portrayed by Martti Suosalo.

In Peter Jackson&#x27;s films &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; (2001) and &quot;The Return of the King&quot; (2003), Bilbo is played by Ian Holm, who had played Frodo in the BBC radio series 20¬†years earlier.

Throughout the 2003 video game &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, the players control Bilbo, voiced by Michael Beattie. The game follows the plot of the book, but adds the elements of platform gameplay and various side-objectives along the main quests. 
In &quot;The Lord of the Rings Online&quot; (2007) Bilbo resides in Rivendell, mostly playing riddle games with the Elf Lindir in the Hall of Fire.

In Peter Jackson&#x27;s &quot;The Hobbit&quot; film series, a prequel to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the young Bilbo is portrayed by Martin Freeman while Ian Holm reprises his role as an older Bilbo in &quot;An Unexpected Journey&quot; (2012) and &quot;The Battle of the Five Armies&quot; (2014).

<text>German submarine &quot;U-238&quot; was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; built for service in the Second World War. She was laid down on 21 April 1942, by Germaniawerft of Kiel as yard number 668, launched on 7 January 1943 and commissioned on 20 February, with &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Horst Hepp in command. Hepp commanded her for her entire career, receiving promotion to &quot;Kapit√§nleutnant&quot; in the process.

==Design==
German Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines. &quot;U-238&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two AEG GU 460/8‚Äì27 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-238&quot; was fitted with five torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen torpedoes, one SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and two twin C/30 anti-aircraft guns. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty.

==Service history==
&quot;U-238&quot; was a member of four wolfpacks; she was a successful, if short lived boat, sinking four freighters and damaging another during her operations against Allied convoys in the Battle of the Atlantic. She had the misfortune, however, of serving at the turning point of the war, when Allied countermeasures were taking a heavy toll on the U-boat force. She conducted three war patrols, beginning in September 1943, following her warm-up trials in the Baltic Sea.

===War Patrols===
&quot;U-238&quot;‚Ä≥s first patrol was conducted from Trondheim in Norway as part of the 1st U-boat Flotilla, and entailed the submarine exiting the North Sea via the Denmark Strait and operating against Allied shipping in the so-called &quot;air cover gap&quot; in the Central Atlantic, where Allied aircraft had insufficient range, on account of fuel limitations, to effectively operate against German U-boats. This first patrol was by far the most successful, as on 20 September 1943, the boat attacked a large convoy, sinking one 7,176 GRT cargo ship and damaging another. This was followed by three more victims on 23 September, when two Norwegian ships and a British freighter were sunk from the same convoy.

&quot;U-238&quot;‚Ä≥s second patrol was less successful. Two weeks after leaving Brest, on the French Atlantic coast, she was attacked by a Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bomber from the escort carrier , whose rockets killed two crew members and wounded five more, prompting the submarine to return to Brest with severe damage, which put her out of service for a month. It was during this patrol that the submarine captured two British Royal Air Force personnel whose Vickers Wellington bomber had been shot down by .

&quot;U-238&quot;‚Ä≥s third and last patrol began in January 1944, and lasted a fruitless month, until on 9 February, she was caught by convoy escorts of SL-147 and MKS-38 off Cape Clear. She counter-attacked, unsuccessfully, and was sunk by the sloops , and . There were no survivors.

===Wolfpacks===
&quot;U-238&quot; took part in four wolfpacks, namely:
* Leuthen (15 ‚Äì 24 September 1943) 
* Schill 2 (17 ‚Äì 22 November 1943) 
* Weddigen (22 November ‚Äì 1 December 1943) 
* Igel 2 (4 ‚Äì 9 February 1944)

<doc id="59587" wikidata="Q190660" url="?curid=59587" title="Anti-lock braking system">
<text>An anti-lock braking system (ABS) is a safety anti-skid braking system used on aircraft and on land vehicles, such as cars, motorcycles, trucks, and buses. ABS operates by preventing the wheels from locking up during braking, thereby maintaining tractive contact with the road surface and allowing the driver to maintain more control over the vehicle.

ABS is an automated system that uses the principles of threshold braking and cadence braking, techniques which were once practiced by skillful drivers before ABS was widespread. ABS operates at a much faster rate and more effectively than most drivers could manage. Although ABS generally offers improved vehicle control and decreases stopping distances on dry and some slippery surfaces, on loose gravel or snow-covered surfaces ABS may significantly increase braking distance, while still improving steering control. Since ABS was introduced in production vehicles, such systems have become increasingly sophisticated and effective. Modern versions may not only prevent wheel lock under braking, but may also alter the front-to-rear brake bias. This latter function, depending on its specific capabilities and implementation, is known variously as electronic brakeforce distribution, traction control system, emergency brake assist, or electronic stability control (ESC).

== History ==
=== Early systems ===
The concept for ABS predates the modern systems that were introduced in the 1950s. In 1908, for example, J.E. Francis introduced his &#x27;Slip Prevention Regulator for Rail Vehicles&#x27;.

In 1920 the French automobile and aircraft pioneer Gabriel Voisin experimented with systems that modulated the hydraulic braking pressure on his aircraft brakes to reduce the risk of tire slippage, as threshold braking on aircraft is nearly impossible. These systems used a flywheel and valve attached to a hydraulic line that feeds the brake cylinders. The flywheel is attached to a drum that runs at the same speed as the wheel. In normal braking, the drum and flywheel should spin at the same speed. However, when a wheel slows down, then the drum would do the same, leaving the flywheel spinning at a faster rate. This causes the valve to open, allowing a small amount of brake fluid to bypass the master cylinder into a local reservoir, lowering the pressure on the cylinder and releasing the brakes. The use of the drum and flywheel meant the valve only opened when the wheel was turning. In testing, a 30% improvement in braking performance was noted, because the pilots immediately applied full brakes instead of slowly increasing pressure in order to find the skid point. An additional benefit was the elimination of burned or burst tires.

The first proper recognition of the ABS system came later with the German engineer Karl W√§ssel, whose system for modulating braking power was officially patented in 1928. W√§ssel, however, never developed a working product and neither did Robert Bosch who produced a similar patent eight years later.

A similar braking system called Decelostat that used direct-current generators to measure wheel slippage was used in railroads in the 1930s. By 1951, flywheel-based Decelostat was used in aircraft to provide anti skid in landings. The device was on trials first in the United States and later by the British. In 1954, &quot;Popular Science&quot; revealed that there was preliminary testing of the Decelostat system to prevent car swirling on a heavy brake by the US car manufacturers in Detroit. However, there was no public information of the test results.

By the early 1950s, the Dunlop Maxaret anti-skid system was in widespread aviation use in the UK, with aircraft such as the Avro Vulcan and Handley Page Victor, Vickers Viscount, Vickers Valiant, English Electric Lightning, de Havilland Comet 2c, de Havilland Sea Vixen, and later aircraft, such as the Vickers VC10, Hawker Siddeley Trident, Hawker Siddeley 125, Hawker Siddeley HS 748 and derived British Aerospace ATP, and BAC One-Eleven, and the Dutch Fokker F27 Friendship (which unusually had a Dunlop high pressure (200 Bar) pneumatic system in lieu of hydraulics for braking, nose wheel steering and landing gear retraction), being fitted with Maxaret as standard. Maxaret, while reducing braking distances by up to 30% in icy or wet conditions, also increased tire life, and had the additional advantage of allowing take-offs and landings in conditions that would preclude flying at all in non-Maxaret equipped aircraft.

In 1958, a Royal Enfield Super Meteor motorcycle was used by the Road Research Laboratory to test the Maxaret anti-lock brake. The experiments demonstrated that anti-lock brakes can be of great value to motorcycles, for which skidding is involved in a high proportion of accidents. Stopping distances were reduced in most of the tests compared with locked wheel braking, particularly on slippery surfaces, in which the improvement could be as much as 30%. Enfield&#x27;s technical director at the time, Tony Wilson-Jones, saw little future in the system, however, and it was not put into production by the company.

A fully-mechanical system saw limited automobile use in the 1960s in the Ferguson P99 racing car, the Jensen FF, and the experimental all-wheel drive Ford Zodiac, but saw no further use; the system proved expensive and unreliable.

The first fully-electronic anti-lock braking system was developed in the late-1960s for the Concorde aircraft.

The modern ABS system was invented in 1971 by Mario Palazzetti (known as &#x27;Mister ABS&#x27;) in the Fiat Research Center and has become standard in almost every car. The system was called Antiskid and the patent was sold to Bosch who named it ABS.

=== Modern systems ===

Chrysler, together with the Bendix Corporation, introduced a computerized, three-channel, four-sensor all-wheel ABS called &quot;Sure Brake&quot; for its 1971 Imperial. It was available for several years thereafter, functioned as intended, and proved reliable. In 1969, Ford introduced an anti-lock braking system called &quot;Sure-Track&quot; to the rear wheels of the Lincoln Continental Mark III and Ford Thunderbird, as an option; it became standard in 1971. The Sure-Track braking system was designed with help from Kelsey-Hayes. In 1971, General Motors introduced the &quot;Trackmaster&quot; rear-wheel only ABS as an option on their rear-wheel drive Cadillac models and called the option the True-Track Braking System on the Oldsmobile Toronado. In 1972, the option was made available in all Cadillacs. In 1971, Nissan offered an EAL (Electro Anti-lock System) developed by Japanese company Denso as an option on the Nissan President, which became Japan&#x27;s first electronic ABS.

1971: The Imperial became the first production car with a 4 wheel computer-operated anti-lock braking system. Toyota introduced electronically controlled anti-skid brakes on Toyota Crown labeled as ESC (Electronic Skid Control).

1971: First truck application: &quot;Antislittamento&quot; system developed by &quot;Fiat Veicoli Industriali&quot; and installed on Fiat truck model 691N1.

1972: four-wheel-drive Triumph 2500 Estates were fitted with Mullard electronic systems as standard. Such cars were rare however and very few remain.

1976: WABCO began the development of the anti-locking braking system on commercial vehicles to prevent locking on slippery roads, followed in 1986 by the electronic braking system (EBS) for heavy-duty vehicles.

1978: Mercedes-Benz W116 As one of the firsts, used an electronic four-wheel multi-channel anti-lock braking system (ABS) from Bosch as an option from 1978 on.

1982: Honda introduced electronically controlled multi-channel ALB (Anti Locking Brakes) as an option for the second generation of Prelude, launched worldwide in 1982. Additional info: the general agent for Honda in Norway required all Preludes for the Norwegian market to have the ALB-system as a standard feature, making Honda Prelude be the first car delivered in Europe with ABS as a standard feature. The Norwegian general agent also included a sunroof and other options to be standard equipment in Norway, adding more luxury to the Honda brand. However, the Norwegian tax system made the well-equipped car very expensive, and the sales suffered from high costs. From 1984 the ALB-system, as well as the other optional features from Honda, was no longer a standard feature in Norway.

In 1985 the Ford Scorpio was introduced to the European market with a Teves electronic system throughout the range as standard. For this the model was awarded the coveted European Car of the Year Award in 1986, with very favorable praise from motoring journalists. After this success, Ford began research into Anti-Lock systems for the rest of their range, which encouraged other manufacturers to follow suit.

Since 1987 ABS has been standard equipment on all Mercedes-Benz automobiles. Lincoln followed suit in 1993.

In 1988, BMW introduced the first motorcycle with an electro-hydraulic ABS: the BMW K100. Yamaha Introduced the FJ1200 model with optional ABS in 1991. Honda followed suit in 1992 with the launch of its first motorcycle ABS on the ST1100 Pan European. In 2007, Suzuki launched its GSF1200SA (Bandit) with an ABS. In 2005, Harley-Davidson began offering an ABS option on police bikes.

== Operation ==
The anti-lock brake controller is also known as the CAB (Controller Anti-lock Brake).

Typically ABS includes a central electronic control unit (ECU), four wheel speed sensors, and at least two hydraulic valves within the brake hydraulics. The ECU constantly monitors the rotational speed of each wheel; if it detects the wheel rotating significantly slower than the speed of the vehicle, a condition indicative of impending wheel lock, it actuates the valves to reduce hydraulic pressure to the brake at the affected wheel, thus reducing the braking force on that wheel; the wheel then turns faster. Conversely, if the ECU detects a wheel turning significantly faster than the others, brake hydraulic pressure to the wheel is increased so the braking force is reapplied, slowing down the wheel. This process is repeated continuously and can be detected by the driver via brake pedal pulsation. Some anti-lock systems can apply or release braking pressure 15 times per second. Because of this, the wheels of cars equipped with ABS are practically impossible to lock even during panic braking in extreme conditions.

The ECU is programmed to disregard differences in wheel rotative speed below a critical threshold because when the car is turning, the two wheels towards the center of the curve turn slower than the outer two. For this same reason, a differential is used in virtually all roadgoing vehicles.

If a fault develops in any part of the ABS, a warning light will usually be illuminated on the vehicle instrument panel, and the ABS will be disabled until the fault is rectified.

Modern ABS applies individual brake pressure to all four wheels through a control system of hub-mounted sensors and a dedicated micro-controller. ABS is offered or comes standard on most road vehicles and is the foundation for electronic stability control systems, which are rapidly increasing in popularity due to the great reduction in the price of vehicle electronics over the years.

Modern electronic stability control (ESC) systems are an evolution of the ABS concept. Here, a minimum of two additional sensors are added to help the system work: these are a steering wheel angle sensor and a gyroscopic sensor. The theory of operation is simple: when the gyroscopic sensor detects that the direction taken by the car does not coincide with what the steering wheel sensor reports, the ESC software will brake the necessary individual wheel(s) (up to three with the most sophisticated systems), so that the vehicle goes the way the driver intends. The steering wheel sensor also helps in the operation of Cornering Brake Control (CBC), since this will tell the ABS that wheels on the inside of the curve should brake more than wheels on the outside, and by how much.

ABS equipment may also be used to implement a traction control system (TCS) on the acceleration of the vehicle. If, when accelerating, the tire loses traction, the ABS controller can detect the situation and take suitable action so that traction is regained. More sophisticated versions of this can also control throttle levels and brakes simultaneously.

The speed sensors of ABS are sometimes used in indirect tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS), which can detect under-inflation of the tire(s) by the difference in the rotational speed of wheels.

== Components ==
There are four main components of ABS: wheel speed sensors, valves, a pump, and a controller.

; Speed sensors (Encoders): A speed sensor is used to determine the acceleration or deceleration of the wheel. These sensors use a magnet and a Hall effect sensor, or a toothed wheel and an electromagnetic coil to generate a signal. The rotation of the wheel or differential induces a magnetic field around the sensor. The fluctuations of this magnetic field generate a voltage in the sensor. Since the voltage induced in the sensor is a result of the rotating wheel, this sensor can become inaccurate at slow speeds. The slower rotation of the wheel can cause inaccurate fluctuations in the magnetic field and thus cause inaccurate readings to the controller.
; Valves: There is a valve in the brake line of each brake controlled by the ABS. On some systems, the valve has three positions:
* In position one, the valve is open; pressure from the master cylinder is passed right through to the brake.
* In position two, the valve blocks the line, isolating that brake from the master cylinder. This prevents the pressure from rising further should the driver push the brake pedal harder.
* In position three, the valve releases some of the pressure from the brake.

The majority of problems with the valve system occur due to clogged valves. When a valve is clogged it is unable to open, close, or change position. An inoperable valve will prevent the system from modulating the valves and controlling pressure supplied to the brakes.

; Pump: The pump in the ABS is used to restore the pressure to the hydraulic brakes after the valves have released it. A signal from the controller will release the valve at the detection of wheel slip. After a valve releases the pressure supplied from the user, the pump is used to restore the desired amount of pressure to the braking system. The controller will modulate the pump&#x27;s status in order to provide the desired amount of pressure and reduce slipping.
; Controller: The controller is an ECU type unit in the car which receives information from each individual wheel speed sensor. If a wheel loses traction, the signal is sent to the controller. The controller will then limit the brake force (EBD) and activate the ABS modulator which actuates the braking valves on and off.

== Use ==
There are many different variations and control algorithms for use in ABS. One of the simpler systems works as follows:
# The controller monitors the speed sensors at all times. It is looking for decelerations in the wheel that are out of the ordinary. Right before a wheel locks up, it will experience a rapid deceleration. If left unchecked, the wheel would stop much more quickly than any car could. It might take a car two to four seconds to stop from 60¬†mph (96.6¬†km/h) under ideal conditions, but a wheel that locks up could stop spinning in less than a second.
# The ABS controller knows that such a rapid deceleration of the car is impossible (and in actuality the rapid deceleration means the wheel is about to slip), so it reduces the pressure to that brake until it sees an acceleration, then it increases the pressure until it sees the deceleration again. It can do this very quickly before the wheel can actually significantly change speed. The result is that the wheel slows down at the same rate as the car, with the brakes keeping the wheels very near the point at which they will start to lock up. This gives the system maximum braking power.
# This replaces the need to manually pump the brakes while driving on a slippery or a low traction surface, allowing to steer even in most emergency braking conditions.
# When the ABS is in operation the driver will feel a pulsing in the brake pedal; this comes from the rapid opening and closing of the valves. This pulsing also tells the driver that the ABS has been triggered.

== Brake types ==
Anti-lock braking systems use different schemes depending on the type of brakes in use. They can be differentiated by the number of channels: that is, how many valves that are individually controlled‚Äîand the number of speed sensors.

; 1) Four-channel, four-sensor ABS: There is a speed sensor on all four wheels and a separate valve for all four wheels. With this setup, the controller monitors each wheel individually to make sure it is achieving maximum braking force.
; 2) Three-channel, four-sensor ABS: There is a speed sensor on all four wheels and a separate valve for each of the front wheels, but only one valve for both of the rear wheels. Older vehicles with four-wheel ABS usually use this type.
; 3) Three-channel, three-sensor ABS: This scheme, commonly found on pickup trucks with four-wheel ABS, has a speed sensor and a valve for each of the front wheels, with one valve and one sensor for both rear wheels. The speed sensor for the rear wheels is located in the rear axle. This system provides individual control of the front wheels, so they can both achieve maximum braking force. The rear wheels, however, are monitored together; they both have to start to lock up before the ABS will activate on the rear. With this system, it is possible that one of the rear wheels will lock during a stop, reducing brake effectiveness. This system is easy to identify, as there are no individual speed sensors for the rear wheels.
;4) Two-channel, four-sensor ABS: This system, commonly found on passenger cars from the late &#x27;80s through the mid-1990s, uses a speed sensor at each wheel, with one control valve each for the front and rear wheels as a pair. If the speed sensor detects lock up at any individual wheel, the control module pulses the valve for both wheels on that end of the car.
; 5) One-channel, one-sensor ABS: This system is commonly found on pickup trucks, SUVs, and vans with rear-wheel ABS. It has one valve, which controls both rear wheels, and a one-speed sensor, located in the rear axle. This system operates the same as the rear end of a three-channel system. The rear wheels are monitored together and they both have to start to lock up before the ABS kicks in. In this system it is also possible that one of the rear wheels will lock, reducing brake effectiveness. This system is also easy to identify, as there are no individual speed sensors for any of the wheels.

== Effectiveness ==
A 2004 Australian study by Monash University Accident Research Centre found that ABS:
* Reduced the risk of multiple vehicle crashes by 18 percent,
* Increased the risk of run-off-road crashes by 35 percent.

On high-traction surfaces such as bitumen, or concrete, many (though not all) ABS-equipped cars are able to attain braking distances better (i.e. shorter) than those that would be possible without the benefit of ABS. In real-world conditions, even an alert and experienced driver without ABS would find it difficult to match or improve on the performance of a typical driver with a modern ABS-equipped vehicle. ABS reduces the chances of crashing, and/or the severity of impact. The recommended technique for non-expert drivers in an ABS-equipped car, in a typical full-braking emergency, is to press the brake pedal as firmly as possible and, where appropriate, to steer around obstructions. In such situations, ABS will significantly reduce the chances of a skid and subsequent loss of control.

In gravel, sand, and deep snow, ABS tends to increase braking distances. On these surfaces, locked wheels dig in and stop the vehicle more quickly. ABS prevents this from occurring. Some ABS calibrations reduce this problem by slowing the cycling time, thus letting the wheels repeatedly briefly lock and unlock. Some vehicle manufacturers provide an &quot;off-road&quot; button to turn the ABS function off. The primary benefit of ABS on such surfaces is to increase the ability of the driver to maintain control of the car rather than go into a skid, though the loss of control remains more likely on soft surfaces such as gravel or on slippery surfaces such as snow or ice. On a very slippery surface such as sheet ice or gravel, it is possible to lock multiple wheels at once, and this can defeat ABS (which relies on comparing all four wheels and detecting individual wheels skidding). The availability of ABS relieves most drivers from learning threshold braking.

A June 1999 National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) study found that ABS increased stopping distances on loose gravel by an average of 27.2 percent.

According to the NHTSA,
&quot;ABS works with your regular braking system by automatically pumping them. In vehicles not equipped with ABS, the driver has to manually pump the brakes to prevent wheel lockup. In vehicles equipped with ABS, your foot should remain firmly planted on the brake pedal, while ABS pumps the brakes for you so you can concentrate on steering to safety.&quot;
When activated, some earlier ABSes caused the brake pedal to pulse noticeably. As most drivers rarely or do not brake hard enough to cause brake lock-up, and drivers typically do not read the vehicle&#x27;s owner&#x27;s manual, this may not be noticeable until an emergency. Some manufacturers have therefore implemented a brake assist system that determines that the driver is attempting a &quot;panic stop&quot; (by detecting that the brake pedal was depressed very quickly, unlike a normal stop where the pedal pressure would usually be gradually increased. Some systems additionally monitor the rate at the accelerator was released, and/or the time between accelerator release and brake application) and the system automatically increases braking force where not enough pressure is applied. Hard or panic braking on bumpy surfaces, because of the bumps causing the speed of the wheel(s) to become erratic may also trigger the ABS, sometimes causing the system to enter its ice mode, where the system severely limits maximum available braking power. Nevertheless, ABS significantly improves safety and control for drivers in most on-road situations.

Anti-lock brakes are the subject of some experiments centred around risk compensation theory, which asserts that drivers adapt to the safety benefit of ABS by driving more aggressively. In a Munich study, half a fleet of taxicabs was equipped with anti-lock brakes, while the other half had conventional brake systems. The crash rate was substantially the same for both types of cab, and Wilde concludes this was due to drivers of ABS-equipped cabs taking more risks, assuming that ABS would take care of them, while the non-ABS drivers drove more carefully since ABS would not be there to help in case of a dangerous situation.

The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety released a study in 2010 that found motorcycles with ABS 37% less likely to be involved in a fatal crash than models without ABS.

==ABS on motorcycles==

On a motorcycle, an anti-lock brake system prevents the wheels of a motorcycle from locking during braking situations. Based on information from wheel speed sensors the ABS unit adjusts the pressure of the brake fluid in order to keep traction during deceleration to avoid accidents. Motorcycle ABS helps the rider to maintain stability during braking and to decrease the stopping distance. It provides traction even on low friction surfaces.

While older ABS models are derived from cars, recent Motorcycle ABS is the result of research, oriented to the specifics of motorcycles in case of size, weight, and functionality. National and international organizations have evaluated Motorcycle ABS to be an important factor in increasing safety and reducing the number and severity of motorcycle crashes and collisions. The European Commission passed legislation in 2012 that made the fitment with ABS for all new motorcycles above 125cc to be mandatory from 1 January 2016. &quot;Consumer Reports&quot; said in 2016 that &quot;ABS is commonly offered on large, expensive models, but it has been spreading to several entry-level sportbikes and midsized bikes&quot;.

===History of motorcycle ABS===
In 1988, BMW introduced an electronic/hydraulic ABS for motorcycles, ten years after Daimler Benz and Bosch released the first four-wheel vehicle ABS for series production. Motorcycles of BMW K100 series were optionally equipped with the ABS, which added 11¬†kg to the bike. It was developed together with FAG Kugelfischer and regulated the pressure in the braking circuits via a plunger piston. Japanese manufacturers followed with an ABS option by 1992 on the Honda ST1100 and the Yamaha FJ1200.

Continental presented its first Motorcycle Integral ABS (MIB) in 2006. It has been developed in cooperation with BMW and weighed 2.3¬†kg.
While the first generation of motorcycle ABS weighed around 11¬†kg, the generation (2011) presented by Bosch in 2009 weighs 0.7¬†kg (ABS base) and 1.6¬†kg (ABS enhanced) with integral braking.

===Basic principle===
Wheel speed sensors mounted on the front and rear wheel constantly measures the rotational speed of each wheel and delivers this information to an Electronic Control Unit (ECU). The ECU detects two things: 1) if the deceleration of one wheel exceeds a fixed threshold and 2) whether the brake slip, calculated based on information of both wheels, rises above a certain percentage and enters an unstable zone. These are indicators for a high possibility of a locking wheel. To countermeasure these irregularities the ECU signals the hydraulic unit to hold or to release pressure. After signals show the return to the stable zone, the pressure is increased again. Past models used a piston for the control of the fluid pressure. Most recent models regulate the pressure by rapidly opening and closing solenoid valves.
While the basic principle and architecture has been carried over from passenger car ABS, typical motorcycle characteristics have to be considered during the development and application processes.
One characteristic is the change of the dynamic wheel load during braking. Compared to cars, the wheel load changes are more drastic, which can lead to a wheel lift up and a fall over. This can be intensified by a soft suspension. Some systems are equipped with a rear-wheel lift-off mitigation functionality. When the indicators of a possible rear lift-off are detected, the system releases brake pressure on the front wheel to counter this behavior.
Another difference is that in the case of the motorcycle the front wheel is much more important for stability than the rear wheel. If the front wheel locks up between 0.2-0.7s, it loses gyrostatic forces and the motorcycle starts to oscillate because of the increased influence of side forces operating on the wheel contact line. The motorcycle becomes unstable and falls.

===Anti-lock Braking System (ABS)===
&quot;Piston Systems&quot;: The pressure release in this system is realized through the movement of a spring-tensioned piston. When pressure should be released, a linear motor pulls back the plunger piston and opens up more space for the fluid. The system was used for example in the ABS I (1988) and ABS II (1993) of BMW. The ABS II differed in size and an electronically controlled friction clutch was mounted on the shaft instead of a plunger. Further displacement sensors record the travel distance of the piston to allow the control unit a more precise regulation. Honda also uses this system of pressure modulation for big sports and touring bikes.

&quot;Valve and Pump Systems&quot;: The main parts which are part of the pressure modulation system are solenoid inlet and outlet valves, a pump, motor, and accumulators/reservoirs. The number of the valves differs from model to model due to additional functionalities and the number of brake channels. Based on the input of the ECU, coils operate the inlet and outlet valves. During pressure release, the brake fluid is stored in accumulators. In this open system approach, the fluid is then brought back in the brake circuit via a pump operated by a motor that is felt through pulsation on the brake lever.

===Regenerative Anti-Lock Braking for Electric 2-wheel vehicles (eABS)===
Electric vehicles can recapture the energy from rear wheel braking.

===Combined Braking System (CBS)===
Contrary to how the wheels on cars and trains react collectively to brakes when applied, on motorcycles the rear wheel brake and front wheel brake are controlled separately. If the rider only brakes with one wheel, this braked wheel tends to lock up faster than if both brakes had been applied. A Combined Braking System therefore distributes the brake force also to the non-braked wheel to lower the possibility of a lock-up, increase deceleration and reduce suspension pitch.

With a single [rear] CBS the brake pressure applied on the rear brake (pedal) is simultaneously distributed to the front wheel. A delay valve cuts the hydraulic pressure to assure that only when strong braking is applied, the pressure is also created at the front wheel. Honda&#x27;s first street motorcycle with a combined braking system (then called Unified Braking) was the 1983 GL1100. This system was derived from the 1970s RCB1000 world endurance race bike.

Larger models with two front discs use a dual CBS System. The system was first installed by Moto Guzzi in 1975. Here, applied brake pressure at the front is also applied to the rear wheel and vice versa. If the front lever is applied, the pressure is built up at 4 of the 6 pots in the 2 calipers at the front. A secondary master cylinder at the front wheel distributes remaining pressure to the rear wheel through a proportional control valve and acts on 2 of the 3 calipers. If a strong brake force is applied at the rear wheel force is also distributed to 2 of the 6 pots of the front wheel. More modern dual CBS use front and rear calipers (and all pots) according to a preset load ratio of front to rear. The proportioning was originally controlled by complex all-hydraulic systems interlinking the front and rear, with a fixed delay or by sensing weight distribution changes. As early as 2001 an electrohydraulic system was introduced by BMW.

===CBS and ABS===
CBS helps to reduce the danger of wheel locks and fall downs but in certain situations, it is possible that CBS causes a fall down. If brake pressure is distributed from the rear wheel to the front wheel and the friction of the surfaces changes suddenly (puddle, ice on the street) the front wheel might lock even if only the rear brake has been applied. This would lead to a loss of stability and a fall down. CBS is therefore combined with ABS to avoid this on a motorcycle.
Different approaches are possible to realize this combination:
&quot;Without active pressure Build up&quot;
Single Version: A third additional channel links the rear wheel circuit through a delay valve to the front brake. Strong brake pressure at the rear wheel (or both wheels) pressurizes both brake circuits however this pressure is adjusted according to wheel speed and brake slip.

The dual version combines Hondas Dual CBS with a secondary master cylinder and a proportional control valve [with Piston ABS] A modulator regulates the pressure for each
&quot;With Active Pressure Build up&quot;
In 2009, Honda introduced the electronic controlled combined ABS for its high-performance sports bikes which utilize brake by wire technology. The brake input of the rider is measured by pressure sensors and the information is provided to an ECU. Together with the information of the wheel speed sensors, the ECU calculates the optimal distribution of pressure to prevent lockups and to provide the best possible deceleration. Based on this output a motor for each wheel operates a pump that builds up and regulates the brake pressure on the wheel. This system offers a fast reaction time because of the brake by wire functionality.

The MIB (Motorcycle integral Braking system) from Continental Teves and the eCBS (electronic CBS) in the enhanced Motorcycle ABS from Bosch are results of another approach. These systems are based on the pump and valve approach. Through additional valves, stronger pumps and a more powerful motor the system can actively build up pressure. The input pressure of the rider is measured with pressure sensors at the lever and pedal. The pump then builds up additional pressure adjusted to riding conditions. A partial integral System is designed for working in one direction only: front‚Üírear or rear‚Üífront. A fully-integrated system works in both directions.

Because these systems are electronically controlled and are able to build up pressure actively, they offer the opportunity to adjust the motorcycle braking behavior to the rider. CBS and ABS can be switched off by experienced riders and also different regulation modes with higher and lower thresholds can be chosen, such as the rain or slick mode in the BMW S1000RR.

==Safety and legislation==
===Safety===
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) conducted a study on the effectiveness of ABS for motorcycles and came to the conclusion that motorcycles above 250¬†cm3 without ABS are 37 percent more likely to be involved in fatal crashes and a study of the Swedish Road Administration came to the conclusion that 48 percent of all severe and fatal motorcycle accidents above 125¬†cm3 could be avoided due to motorcycle ABS.

These studies caused the EU commission to initiate a legislative process in 2010 that was passed in 2012 and led to ABS for motorcycles above 125¬†cm3 becoming mandatory from 2016 onwards. Organizations like the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile and the Institute of advanced Motorists (IAM) demanded the implementation of this legislation already for 2015.
On the other hand, some motorcycle riders are protesting against a compulsory ABS for all bikes because they call for a possibility to switch the system off, for off-road usage or for other reasons.
In 2011 the United Nations (UN) started the Decade of Action for Road Safety. The main goal is to save 5 million lives until 2020 through global cooperation.
One part of their global plan is to: Encourage universal deployment of crash avoidance technologies with proven effectiveness such as Electronic Stability Control and Anti-Lock Braking Systems in motorcycles.

<text>Vladim√≠r Meƒçiar (; born 26 July 1942) is a Slovak former politician who served as the prime minister of Slovakia from June 1990 to May 1991, June 1992 to March 1994, and again from December 1994 to October 1998. He was the leader of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), a populist party in Slovakia.

Meƒçiar led Slovakia during the dissolution of Czechoslovakia in 1992‚Äì93 and was one of the leading presidential candidates in Slovakia in 1999 and 2004. During his time in office, he was criticized for his autocratic style of governance and connections to organized crime, which became known as &quot;Meƒçiarizmus&quot; (&quot;Meƒçiarism&quot;).

== Early life ==
Meƒçiar was born in Detva in 1942 as the eldest of four boys. His father was a tailor, and his mother was a housewife.

== Career ==

=== Early period ===
Starting in the Communist Party of Slovakia, the only road to prominence in Communist Czechoslovakia, he became committee chairman in the town of ≈Ωiar nad Hronom, only to be dismissed in the year after the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, when he delivered a pro-reform speech to the national congress in 1969 and was thrown out. A year later he was also expelled from the Communist Party and then added to the Communist Party Central Committee&#x27;s long list of enemies of the socialist regime. He put himself through the Faculty of Law of the Comenius University while working in a glass factory.

=== Velvet Revolution ===
In late 1989, during the fast-paced anti-Communist Velvet Revolution, he joined the new political party, Public Against Violence (Verejnos≈• proti n√°siliu, VPN), which was the Slovak counterpart to the better-known Czech Civic Forum. On 11 January 1990, when the VPN was looking for professionals to participate in the government of Slovakia, Meƒçiar was appointed as Minister of the Interior and Environment of Slovakia on a recommendation of Alexander Dubƒçek, who was impressed by Meƒçiar&#x27;s thorough knowledge in all relevant fields.

== Prime minister ==

=== First term ===
After the first democratic elections in Czechoslovakia in June 1990, he was named Slovak prime minister (representing the VPN) of a coalition government of VPN and the Christian Democratic Movement. He advocated economic reform and continued federation with the Czechs.

In 1990 the political landscape of the Czech Republic and Slovakia started to develop and many new political parties were formed, mainly from the Civic Forum and the VPN. By the end of 1990, some of Meƒçiar&#x27;s partners in the VPN began distancing themselves from him. First, the party split into two fractions in early March 1991: Meƒçiar supporters (mostly members of his cabinet) and Meƒçiar opponents (led by the VPN chairman Fedor G√°l). On 23 April 1991, the Presidium of the Slovak parliament (Slovak National Council) deposed him as premier of Slovakia and he was replaced by J√°n ƒåarnogursk√Ω, the leader of the Christian Democratic Movement. Three days later, the VPN officially split in two: the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) and the remaining VPN (since October 1991 called OD√ö-VPN, later just OD√ö). Meƒçiar was elected HZDS chairman in June 1991.

=== Second term ===

In 1991 and 1992, there were frequent, but fruitless, negotiations between the Czech Republic and Slovak Republic concerning the future relations between the two constituent republics of Czechoslovakia. The winners of the June 1992 elections in Czechoslovakia and new prime ministers were the Civic Democratic Party led by V√°clav Klaus in the Czech Republic and the HZDS led by Vladim√≠r Meƒçiar in Slovakia. Before and shortly after this election, the HZDS supported the creation of a looser federation‚Äîa confederation‚Äîbetween the two republics. However, its Czech counterpart wanted an even more centralized Czechoslovakia than was the case in 1992 or two separate countries. Since these two concepts were irreconcilable, Meƒçiar and Klaus agreed (after intense negotiations, but without having consulted the population in a referendum) on 23 July in Bratislava to dissolve Czechoslovakia and to create two independent states. As a result, Meƒçiar and Klaus became the prime ministers of two independent states on 1 January 1993. Meƒçiar also opposed the free-market shock therapy proposed by Prague and Klaus&#x27; party to all of Czechoslovakia.

After eight members of the parliament left the HZDS in March 1993, Meƒçiar lost his parliamentary majority. At the same time Meƒçiar&#x27;s HZDS also lost the support of the president, Michal Kov√°ƒç, who was originally nominated by the HZDS. However, it was only in March 1994 that he was unseated as prime minister by the parliament (National Council of the Slovak Republic) and the opposition parties created a new government under Jozef Moravƒç√≠k&#x27;s lead. However, after the elections held at the turn of September and October 1994, in which his HZDS won 35% of the votes, he became prime minister again ‚Äî in a coalition with the far-right Slovak National Party headed by the controversial J√°n Slota, and the radical-left Zdru≈æenie robotn√≠kov Slovenska headed by the colourful J√°n ƒΩupt√°k, a mason.

=== Third term ===
During the following period, he was constantly criticized by his opponents and Western countries for an autocratic style of administration, lack of respect for democracy, misuse of state media for propaganda, corruption and the shady privatization of national companies that occurred during his rule. Privatization during the 1990s in both Slovakia and the Czech Republic was harmed by widespread unlawful asset stripping (also described by the journalistic term of &quot;tunnelling&quot;).

At the same time relations between Meƒçiar and the President of Slovakia, Michal Kov√°ƒç were rather strained. He was also blamed for having engaged the Slovak secret service (SIS) in the abduction of the President&#x27;s son Michal Kov√°ƒç, Jr. ‚Äî wanted on a warrant for a financial crime in Germany ‚Äî to Hainburg, Austria, in August 1995, but his guilt has not been proven. However, after Kovaƒç&#x27;s term expired in March 1998 the Slovak parliament was unable to elect a successor, so Meƒçiar also temporarily assumed the role of acting president. As president, he issued an amnesty for some of those accused of the abduction. As a result, Slovakia under his rule became partially isolated from the West and the pace of EU and NATO accession negotiations was much slower than in the case of neighboring countries, although Meƒçiar supported both EU and NATO memberships for his country and submitted Slovakia&#x27;s applications to both organisations.

Meƒçiar and HZDS narrowly finished first in the 1998 elections, with 27% of the votes. However, he was unable to create a coalition, and Mikul√°≈° Dzurinda from the opposition became the new Prime Minister. Afterwards, Meƒçiar was one of the two leading candidates for the first direct election of the president of Slovakia in 1999, but he was defeated by Rudolf Schuster. In 2000, Meƒçiar&#x27;s HZDS was renamed &quot;People&#x27;s Party ‚Äî Movement for a Democratic Slovakia&quot;.

== Post-premiership ==
In 2000 Meƒçiar ostensibly gave up his political ambitions. His HZDS colleague August√≠n Mari√°n H√∫ska said: &quot;The NATO-War against Yugoslavia in 1999 was also a signal to us, to not pursue any vision of political independence anymore. We have seen what will happen to forces that want to be independent.&quot; In 2000, Meƒçiar was arrested by Slovak police on charges of fraud dating from his term in office.

Meƒçiar was heavily favored to win the 2002 election, but it was thought that if he became prime minister again, it would end any chance of Slovakia getting into the EU. The 2002 elections saw the HZDS score a high percentage (20%) again. However, as in 1998, no other party was willing to serve under him. The result was another term in government for Dzurinda. The lower percentage of Meƒçiar&#x27;s HZDS (20%) compared to the 1998 result (27%) was due to internal disputes within the organization shortly before the election, which caused many traditional HZDS members to leave the party. Some of them created the HZD (Movement for Democracy) party led by Ivan Ga≈°paroviƒç. In 2003, further traditional HZDS members left the party and most of them created the People&#x27;s Union (ƒΩudov√° √∫nia).

In the 2004 presidential election, Meƒçiar tried to become Slovak president again, but was defeated in the second round by his former, long-standing ally Ivan Ga≈°paroviƒç. In the 2006 parliamentary election in Slovakia, HZDS had the worst election result in its history, just 8.79%. Meƒçiar requested an examination of the election results. While HZDS became part of Robert Fico&#x27;s coalition, Meƒçiar was not a Cabinet member. He declined to participate in the 2009 presidential election but also denied considering political retirement.

In the 2010 parliamentary election, Meƒçiar&#x27;s HZDS dropped to 4%, leaving it out of parliament for the first time in its history. In the 2012 elections, the HZDS saw its vote collapse to 0.93%, leaving it again outside of parliament. Eventually, the party was dissolved in 2014.

== Personal life ==
His wife Margita is a medical doctor, and they have three children.

<doc id="59592" wikidata="Q748148" url="?curid=59592" title="Kawasaki Heavy Industries">
<text>is a Japanese public multinational corporation manufacturer of motorcycles, engines, heavy equipment, aerospace and defense equipment, rolling stock and ships, headquartered in Minato, Tokyo, Japan. It is also active in the production of industrial robots, gas turbines, pumps, boilers and other industrial products. The company is named after its founder, Sh≈çz≈ç Kawasaki. KHI is known as one of the three major heavy industrial manufacturers of Japan, alongside Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and IHI. Prior to the Second World War, KHI was part of the Kobe Kawasaki &quot;zaibatsu&quot;, which included Kawasaki Steel and Kawasaki Kisen. After the conflict, KHI became part of the DKB Group (&quot;keiretsu&quot;).

== History ==

Sh≈çz≈ç Kawasaki, born in 1836, was involved with the marine industry from a young age. He was involved with two offshore disasters but accredited his survival to the modernization of the ships. This led to the decision to create technological innovations for the Japanese shipping industry. In 1878, after struggling to find business, his first order was placed. This is marked as the company&#x27;s start in the industry.

In 1886, Kawasaki moved the business from Tokyo to Hyogo. This allowed space for the rise of orders placed to his company and the renaming to Kawasaki Dockyard. The new and improved company went public as Kawasaki Dockyard Co., Ltd when the demand for ships rose during the Sino-Japanese War of 1894. Kojiro Matsukata was announced as the company&#x27;s first president.

After opening a new factory in 1906, Kawasaki began diversifying its products. They began to produce parts for the railroad, automotive, and airplane industry by the end of World War 1. After the war, along with the Allied arms-limitation agreement in 1912, Kawasaki faced a huge decline in shipbuilding. In 1929, the Depression caused a large amount of financial problems with the company.

During World War 2, Kawasaki was a major builder of combat aircraft like the Ki-61, which killed many Allied aircrew. Just afterwards, they adapted air intakes from combat aircraft to high speed motorcycles. In 1947, the government introduced a new shipbuilding agenda and gave Kawasaki a rise in profits and helped restore the company. The company was able to resume all operations and by the 1950s, Japan was leading as the world&#x27;s largest shipbuilder.

By the late 1960s into the 1970s Kawasaki had begun to withdraw from the shipbuilding industry and diversified its company, producing motorcycles, jet skis, bridges, tunnel-boring machines, and aircraft. They also supplied technologically advanced railroad cars to the New York subway system.

In 1995, Kawasaki Heavy Industries came to an agreement with China to produce the largest containerships ever. This led to the company announcing higher than expected profits in 1996. However, shortly after the profits, the company saw a long decline in business forcing them to find a solution.

With the company seeing continuous losses into the 21st century, it formed a joint venture with Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co. However, by the end of 2001, the agreement was terminated. In the following years, Kawasaki Heavy Industries Co. have seen a fluctuation of profits and losses.

===Aerospace===

Kawasaki is active in a diverse range of the aerospace industry. The company is a contractor for the Japanese ministry of defence and has built aircraft such as the C-1 transport aircraft, T-4 intermediate jet trainer, and the P-3C antisubmarine warfare patrol airplane. Since 2007, it has built the P-1 maritime patrol aircraft, and since 2010, it has built the C-2 transport aircraft. Kawasaki also builds helicopters, including the BK117, jointly developed and manufactured with MBB. It also produces the CH-47J / JA helicopter.

In the commercial aviation business, the company is involved in the joint international development and production of large passenger aircraft. It is involved in joint development and production of the Boeing 767, Boeing 777 and Boeing 787 with The Boeing Company, and the 170, 175, 190 and 195 jets with Empresa Brasileira de Aeron√°utica. It is also involved in the joint international development and production of turbofan engines for passenger aircraft such as the V2500, the RB211/Trent, the PW4000 and the CF34.

Kawasaki also works for the JAXA. The company was responsible for the development and production of the payload fairings, payload attach fittings (PAF) and the construction of the launch complex for the H-II rocket. It continues to provide services for the H-IIA rocket.

Kawasaki has also participated in projects such as the development of reusable launch vehicles for spacecraft that will handle future space transport, space robotics projects such as the Japanese Experiment Module for the International Space Station, the cancelled HOPE-X experimental orbiting plane and the docking mechanism for the ETS-VII. According to a document from July 1997, they would have been a major manufacturer of the Kankoh-maru space tourism vehicle (also known as the Kawasaki S-1), which never saw production.

In 2022, Kawasaki and Airbus signed a memorandum of understanding to address hydrogen needs in aviation, and to focus on airport hydrogen hubs development.

==Service history==
She had several commanders over her long career. Michahelles was relieved on 30 September 1936, by &quot;Kapit√§nleutnant&quot; (&quot;Kptlt.&quot;) Heinrich Liebe. Liebe turned command over on 31 January 1938 to &quot;Oblt.z.S.&quot; Herbert Schultze. On 16 March 1939, &quot;Kptlt.&quot; Helmut Rosenbaum assumed command and on 7 July 1940, &quot;Oblt.z.S.&quot; Hans Heidtmann joined Rosenbaum as deputy commander.

The wreck was raised the next day and stricken.

<text>Dame Margaret Taylor Rutherford (11 May 1892 ‚Äì 22 May 1972) was an English actress of stage, film and television.

She came to national attention following World War II in the film adaptations of No√´l Coward&#x27;s &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot;, and Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot;. In 1948, she was awarded with Special Tony Award for Outstanding Foreign Company as a &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; cast member and later won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress ‚Äì Motion Picture for her role as the Duchess of Brighton in &quot;The V.I.P.s&quot; (1963). In the early 1960s, she starred as Agatha Christie&#x27;s character Miss Marple in a series of four George Pollock films. She was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1961 and a Dame Commander (DBE) in 1967.
==Early life==
Rutherford&#x27;s early life was overshadowed by tragedies involving both of her parents. Her father, journalist and poet William Rutherford Benn, married Florence Nicholson on 16 December 1882 in Wandsworth, South London. One month after the marriage, he suffered a nervous breakdown and was admitted to Bethnal House Lunatic Asylum. Released to travel under his family&#x27;s supervision, he murdered his father, the Reverend Julius Benn, a Congregational Church minister, by bludgeoning him to death with a chamber pot, before slashing his own throat with a pocket knife at an inn in Matlock, Derbyshire on 4 March 1883.

Following the inquest, William Benn was certified insane and removed to Broadmoor Criminal Lunatic Asylum. Seven years later, on 26 July 1890, he was discharged from Broadmoor and reunited with his wife. He legally dropped his surname.

Margaret Taylor Rutherford, the only child of William and Florence, was born in 1892 in Balham, South London. Margaret&#x27;s uncle, Sir John Benn, 1st Baronet, was a politician, and her first cousin once removed was the Labour politician Tony Benn. Hoping to start a new life far from the scene of their recent troubles, the Rutherfords emigrated to Madras, India, but Margaret was sent back to Britain when she was three years old to live with her aunt Bessie Nicholson in Wimbledon, South London, after her pregnant mother hanged herself from a tree.

Young Margaret had been told that her father died of a broken heart soon afterward. When she was 12 years old, she was shocked to learn that her father had actually been readmitted to Broadmoor Hospital in 1903, where he remained until his death on 4 August 1921. Her parents&#x27; mental afflictions gave rise to a fear that she might succumb to similar maladies, a fear that haunted her for the rest of her life. She suffered intermittent bouts of depression and anxiety.

Margaret Rutherford was educated at Wimbledon High School (now a theatre space, the Rutherford Centre, named after her) and, from the age of 13, at Raven&#x27;s Croft School, a boarding school in Sutton Avenue, Seaford. While she was there, she developed an interest in the theatre and performed in amateur dramatics. After she left school, her aunt paid for her to have private acting lessons. When her aunt died, she left a legacy that allowed Rutherford to secure entry to the Old Vic School. In her autobiography, Rutherford called her Aunt Bessie her &quot;adoptive mother and one of the saints of the world&quot;.

==Stage career==
Rutherford, a talented pianist, first found work as a piano teacher and a teacher of elocution. She developed an acting career relatively late, making her stage debut only in 1925, aged 33, at the Old Vic. As her &quot;spaniel jowls&quot; and bulky frame made being cast in romantic heroine roles impossible, she established her name in comedy, appearing in many of the most successful British plays and films. &quot;I never intended to play for laughs. I am always surprised that the audience thinks me funny at all&quot;, Rutherford wrote in her autobiography. Rutherford made her first appearance in London&#x27;s West End in 1933, but her talent was not recognised by the critics until her performance as Miss Prism in John Gielgud&#x27;s production of &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; at the Globe Theatre in 1939.

In 1941 No√´l Coward&#x27;s &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; opened on the London stage at the Piccadilly Theatre, with Coward directing. Rutherford received rave reviews from audiences and critics alike for her lusty portrayal of the bumbling medium Madame Arcati, a role for which Coward had envisioned her. Theatre critic Kenneth Tynan once said of her performances: &quot;The unique thing about Margaret Rutherford is that she can act with her chin alone.&quot;
Another theatrical success during the war years included her part as the sinister housekeeper Mrs. Danvers in Daphne du Maurier&#x27;s &quot;Rebecca&quot; at the Queen&#x27;s Theatre in 1940. Her post-war theatre credits included Miss Prism in &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; again at the Haymarket Theatre in 1946 and Lady Bracknell when the same play transferred to New York City in 1947. She played an officious headmistress in &quot;The Happiest Days of Your Life&quot; at the Apollo Theatre in 1948 and classical roles such as Madame Desmortes in &quot;Ring Round the Moon&quot; at the Globe Theatre, 1950, Lady Wishfort in &quot;The Way of the World&quot; at Lyric Hammersmith, 1953 and Saville Theatres, in 1956, and Mrs. Candour in &quot;The School for Scandal&quot; at the Haymarket Theatre in 1962. Her final stage performance came in 1966 when she played Mrs. Malaprop in &quot;The Rivals&quot; at the Haymarket Theatre, alongside Sir Ralph Richardson. Her declining health meant she had to give up the role.

==Film career==
Although she made her film debut in 1936, it was Rutherford&#x27;s turn as Madame Arcati in David Lean&#x27;s film of &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; (1945) that established her in films. Her jaunty performance, cycling about the Kent countryside, head held high, back straight, and cape fluttering behind her, established the model for portraying that role thereafter. She was Nurse Carey in &quot;Miranda&quot; (1948) and the sprightly Medieval expert Professor Hatton-Jones in &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot; (1949), one of the Ealing Comedies. She reprised her stage roles of the headmistress alongside Alastair Sim in &quot;The Happiest Days of Your Life&quot; (1950) and Miss Prism in Anthony Asquith&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;The Importance of Being Earnest&quot; (1952).

More comedies followed, including &quot;Castle in the Air&quot; (1952) with David Tomlinson, &quot;Trouble in Store&quot; (1953), with Norman Wisdom, &quot;The Runaway Bus&quot; (1954) with Frankie Howerd and &quot;An Alligator Named Daisy&quot; (1955) with Donald Sinden and Diana Dors. Rutherford worked with Norman Wisdom again in &quot;Just My Luck&quot; (1957) and co-starred in &quot;The Smallest Show on Earth&quot; with Virginia McKenna, Peter Sellers and Leslie Phillips (both 1957). She starred alongside Ian Carmichael and Peter Sellers, in the Boulting Brothers satire &quot;I&#x27;m All Right Jack&quot; (1959).

In the early 1960s, she appeared as Miss Jane Marple in a series of four George Pollock films loosely based on novels by Agatha Christie. The films depicted Marple as a colourful character, respectable but bossy and eccentric. Authors Marion Shaw and Sabine Vanacker in their book &quot;Reflecting on Miss Marple&quot; (1991) complained that the emphasis on the &quot;dotty element in the character&quot; missed entirely &quot;the quietness and sharpness&quot; so admired in the novels. The actress, then aged in her 70s, insisted on wearing her own clothes for the parts and having her husband appear alongside her. In 1963 Christie dedicated her novel &quot;The Mirror Crack&#x27;d from Side to Side&quot; &quot;To Margaret Rutherford in admiration&quot;, though the novelist was critical of the films for diverging from her original plots and playing dramatic scenes for laughs. Rutherford reprised the role of Miss Marple in a very brief, uncredited cameo in the 1965 film &quot;The Alphabet Murders&quot;.

Rutherford played the absent-minded, impoverished, pill-popping Duchess of Brighton ‚Äì the only comedy relief ‚Äì in &quot;The V.I.P.s&quot; (1963) from a screenplay by Terence Rattigan. The film features a star-studded cast led by Maggie Smith, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton. For her performance, she won an Academy Award and Golden Globe Awards for Best Supporting Actress. At the time she set a record for the oldest woman and last born in the nineteenth century to win an Oscar.

She appeared as Mistress Quickly in Orson Welles&#x27; film &quot;Chimes at Midnight&quot; (1965) and was directed by Charlie Chaplin in &quot;A Countess from Hong Kong&quot; (1967), starring Marlon Brando and Sophia Loren, which was one of her final films. She started work on &quot;The Virgin and the Gypsy&quot; (1970), but illness caused her to be replaced by Fay Compton.

==Personal life, illness and death==
In 1945, Rutherford, 53, married character actor Stringer Davis, 46, after a courtship that lasted 15 years. Davis&#x27; mother reportedly considered Rutherford an unsuitable match for her son, and their wedding was postponed until after Mrs. Davis had died. Subsequently, the couple appeared in many productions together. Davis adored Rutherford, with one friend noting: &quot;For him she was not only a great talent but, above all, a beauty.&quot; The actor and former serviceman rarely left his wife&#x27;s side, serving Rutherford as private secretary. He also nursed and comforted her through periodic debilitating depression. These illnesses, sometimes involving stays in mental hospitals and electric shock treatment, were kept hidden from the press during Rutherford&#x27;s lifetime.

In the 1950s, Rutherford and Davis unofficially adopted writer Gordon Langley Hall (later Dawn Langley Simmons), then in her twenties, who later wrote a biography of Rutherford in 1983. 

Rutherford suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease at the end of her life and was unable to work. Davis cared for his wife at their Buckinghamshire home until her death on 22 May 1972, aged 80. Many of Britain&#x27;s top actors, including Sir John Gielgud, Sir Ralph Richardson, Dame Flora Robson and Joyce Grenfell, attended a memorial Service of Thanksgiving at the Actors&#x27; Church, St. Paul&#x27;s, Covent Garden, on 21 July 1972, where 90-year-old Dame Sybil Thorndike praised her friend&#x27;s enormous talent and recalled that Rutherford had &quot;never said anything horrid about anyone&quot;.

Rutherford and Davis (who died in 1973) are interred at the graveyard of St. James&#x27;s Church, Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire. &quot;A Blithe Spirit&quot; is inscribed on the base of Margaret Rutherford&#x27;s memorial stone, a reference to the No√´l Coward play that helped to make her name.

<text>In real analysis the Heine‚ÄìBorel theorem, named after Eduard Heine and √âmile Borel, states:

For a subset &quot;S&quot; of Euclidean space R&quot;n&quot;, the following two statements are equivalent:
*&quot;S&quot; is compact, that is, every open cover of &quot;S&quot; has a finite subcover
*&quot;S&quot; is closed and bounded.

==History and motivation==

The history of what today is called the Heine‚ÄìBorel theorem starts in the 19th century, with the search for solid foundations of real analysis. Central to the theory was the concept of uniform continuity and the theorem stating that every continuous function on a closed and bounded interval is uniformly continuous. Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet was the first to prove this and implicitly he used the existence of a finite subcover of a given open cover of a closed interval in his proof. He used this proof in his 1852 lectures, which were published only in 1904. Later Eduard Heine, Karl Weierstrass and Salvatore Pincherle used similar techniques. √âmile Borel in 1895 was the first to state and prove a form of what is now called the Heine‚ÄìBorel theorem. His formulation was restricted to countable covers. Pierre Cousin (1895), Lebesgue (1898) and Schoenflies (1900) generalized it to arbitrary covers.

== Proof ==

If a set is compact, then it must be closed.

Let &quot;S&quot; be a subset of R&quot;n&quot;. Observe first the following: if &quot;a&quot; is a limit point of &quot;S&quot;, then any finite collection &quot;C&quot; of open sets, such that each open set &quot;U&quot; ‚àà &quot;C&quot; is disjoint from some neighborhood &quot;V&quot;&quot;U&quot; of &quot;a&quot;, fails to be a cover of &quot;S&quot;. Indeed, the intersection of the finite family of sets &quot;V&quot;&quot;U&quot; is a neighborhood &quot;W&quot; of &quot;a&quot; in R&quot;n&quot;. Since &quot;a&quot; is a limit point of &quot;S&quot;, &quot;W&quot; must contain a point &quot;x&quot; in &quot;S&quot;. This &quot;x&quot; ‚àà &quot;S&quot; is not covered by the family &quot;C&quot;, because every &quot;U&quot; in &quot;C&quot; is disjoint from &quot;V&quot;&quot;U&quot; and hence disjoint from &quot;W&quot;, which contains &quot;x&quot;.

If &quot;S&quot; is compact but not closed, then it has a limit point &quot;a&quot; not in &quot;S&quot;. Consider a collection &#x27; consisting of an open neighborhood &quot;N&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) for each &quot;x&quot; ‚àà &quot;S&quot;, chosen small enough to not intersect some neighborhood &quot;V&quot;&quot;x&quot; of &quot;a&quot;. Then &#x27; is an open cover of &quot;S&quot;, but any finite subcollection of &quot;&quot; has the form of &quot;C&quot; discussed previously, and thus cannot be an open subcover of &quot;S&quot;. This contradicts the compactness of &quot;S&quot;. Hence, every limit point of &quot;S&quot; is in &quot;S&quot;, so &quot;S&quot; is closed.

The proof above applies with almost no change to showing that any compact subset &quot;S&quot; of a Hausdorff topological space &quot;X&quot; is closed in &quot;X&quot;.

If a set is compact, then it is bounded.

Let formula_1 be a compact set in formula_2, and formula_3 a ball of radius 1 centered at formula_4. Then the set of all such balls centered at formula_5 is clearly an open cover of formula_1, since formula_7 contains all of formula_1. Since formula_1 is compact, take a finite subcover of this cover. This subcover is the finite union of balls of radius 1. Consider all pairs of centers of these (finitely many) balls (of radius 1) and let formula_10 be the maximum of the distances between them. Then if formula_11 and formula_12 are the centers (respectively) of unit balls containing arbitrary formula_13, the triangle inequality says:

formula_14

So the diameter of formula_1 is bounded by formula_16.

Lemma: A closed subset of a compact set is compact.

Let &quot;K&quot; be a closed subset of a compact set &quot;T&quot; in R&quot;n&quot; and let &quot;C&quot;&quot;K&quot; be an open cover of &quot;K&quot;. Then is an open set and
formula_17

is an open cover of &quot;T&quot;. Since &quot;T&quot; is compact, then &quot;C&quot;&quot;T&quot; has a finite subcover formula_18 that also covers the smaller set &quot;K&quot;. Since &quot;U&quot; does not contain any point of &quot;K&quot;, the set &quot;K&quot; is already covered by formula_19 that is a finite subcollection of the original collection &quot;C&quot;&quot;K&quot;. It is thus possible to extract from any open cover &quot;C&quot;&quot;K&quot; of &quot;K&quot; a finite subcover.

If a set is closed and bounded, then it is compact.

If a set &quot;S&quot; in R&quot;n&quot; is bounded, then it can be enclosed within an &quot;n&quot;-box

formula_20

where &quot;a&quot; &gt; 0. By the lemma above, it is enough to show that &quot;T&quot;0 is compact.

Assume, by way of contradiction, that &quot;T&quot;0 is not compact. Then there exists an infinite open cover &quot;C&quot; of &quot;T&quot;0 that does not admit any finite subcover. Through bisection of each of the sides of &quot;T&quot;0, the box &quot;T&quot;0 can be broken up into 2&quot;n&quot; sub &quot;n&quot;-boxes, each of which has diameter equal to half the diameter of &quot;T&quot;0. Then at least one of the 2&quot;n&quot; sections of &quot;T&quot;0 must require an infinite subcover of &quot;C&quot;, otherwise &quot;C&quot; itself would have a finite subcover, by uniting together the finite covers of the sections. Call this section &quot;T&quot;1.

Likewise, the sides of &quot;T&quot;1 can be bisected, yielding 2&quot;n&quot; sections of &quot;T&quot;1, at least one of which must require an infinite subcover of &quot;C&quot;. Continuing in like manner yields a decreasing sequence of nested &quot;n&quot;-boxes:

formula_21

where the side length of &quot;T&quot;&quot;k&quot; is , which tends to 0 as &quot;k&quot; tends to infinity. Let us define a sequence (&quot;x&quot;k) such that each &quot;x&quot;k is in &quot;T&quot;k. This sequence is Cauchy, so it must converge to some limit &quot;L&quot;. Since each &quot;T&quot;&quot;k&quot; is closed, and for each &quot;k&quot; the sequence (&quot;x&quot;k) is eventually always inside &quot;T&quot;k, we see that &quot;L&quot;¬†‚àà¬†&quot;T&quot;k for each &quot;k&quot;.

Since &quot;C&quot; covers &quot;T&quot;0, then it has some member &quot;U&quot;¬†‚àà &quot;C&quot; such that &quot;L&quot;¬†‚àà &quot;U&quot;. Since &quot;U&quot; is open, there is an &quot;n&quot;-ball . For large enough &quot;k&quot;, one has , but then the infinite number of members of &quot;C&quot; needed to cover &quot;Tk&quot; can be replaced by just one: &quot;U&quot;, a contradiction.

Thus, &quot;T&quot;0 is compact. Since &quot;S&quot; is closed and a subset of the compact set &quot;T&quot;0, then &quot;S&quot; is also compact (see the lemma above).

== Generalization of the Heine-Borel theorem ==

In general metric spaces, we have the following theorem:

For a subset formula_1 of a metric space formula_23, the following two statements are equivalent:
* formula_1 is compact,
* formula_1 is precompact and complete.

The above follows directly from Jean Dieudonn√©, theorem 3.16.1, which states:

For a metric space formula_23, the following three conditions are equivalent:
* (a) formula_27 is compact;
* (b) any infinite sequence in formula_27 has at least a cluster value;
* (c) formula_27 is precompact and complete.

The Heine‚ÄìBorel theorem does not hold as stated for general metric and topological vector spaces, and this gives rise to the necessity to consider special classes of spaces where this proposition is true. These spaces are said to have the Heine‚ÄìBorel property.

===In the theory of metric spaces=== 
A metric space formula_30 is said to have the Heine‚ÄìBorel property if each closed bounded set in formula_27 is compact.

Many metric spaces fail to have the Heine‚ÄìBorel property, such as the metric space of rational numbers (or indeed any incomplete metric space). Complete metric spaces may also fail to have the property; for instance, no infinite-dimensional Banach spaces have the Heine‚ÄìBorel property (as metric spaces). Even more trivially, if the real line is not endowed with the usual metric, it may fail to have the Heine‚ÄìBorel property.

A metric space formula_30 has a Heine‚ÄìBorel metric which is Cauchy locally identical to formula_33 if and only if it is complete, formula_34-compact, and locally compact.

===In the theory of topological vector spaces===
A topological vector space formula_27 is said to have the Heine‚ÄìBorel property (R.E. Edwards uses the term &quot;boundedly compact space&quot;) if each closed bounded set in formula_27 is compact. No infinite-dimensional Banach spaces have the Heine‚ÄìBorel property (as topological vector spaces). But some infinite-dimensional Fr√©chet spaces do have, for instance, the space formula_37 of smooth functions on an open set formula_38 and the space formula_39 of holomorphic functions on an open set formula_40. More generally, any quasi-complete nuclear space has the Heine‚ÄìBorel property. All Montel spaces have the Heine‚ÄìBorel property as well.

<text>A disc brake is a type of brake that uses the calipers to squeeze pairs of pads against a disc (sometimes called a [brake] rotor) to create friction. There are two basic types of brake pad friction mechanisms: abrasive friction and adherent friction. This action slows the rotation of a shaft, such as a vehicle axle, either to reduce its rotational speed or to hold it stationary. The energy of motion is converted into heat, which must be dissipated to the environment.

Hydraulically actuated disc brakes are the most commonly used mechanical device for slowing motor vehicles. The principles of a disc brake apply to almost any rotating shaft. The components include the disc, master cylinder, and caliper, which contain at least one cylinder and two brake pads on both sides of the rotating disc.

==Design==

The development of disc-type brakes began in England in the 1890s. In 1902, the Lanchester Motor Company designed brakes that looked and operated similarly to a modern disc-brake system even though the disc was thin and a cable activated the brake pad. Other designs were not practical or widely available in cars for another 60 years. Successful application began in airplanes before World War II. The German Tiger tank was fitted with discs in 1942. After the war, technological progress began in 1949, with caliper-type four-wheel disc brakes on the Crosley line and a Chrysler non-caliper type. In the 1950s, there was a demonstration of superiority at the 1953 24 Hours of Le Mans race, which required braking from high speeds several times per lap. The Jaguar racing team won, using disc brake-equipped cars, with much of the credit being given to the brakes&#x27; superior performance over rivals equipped with drum brakes. Mass production began with the 1949‚Äì1950 inclusion in all Crosley production, with sustained mass production starting in 1955 Citro√´n DS.

Disc brakes offer better stopping performance than drum brakes because the disc is more readily cooled. Consequently, discs are less prone to the brake fade caused when brake components overheat. Disc brakes also recover more quickly from immersion (wet brakes are less effective than dry ones).

Most drum brake designs have at least one leading shoe, which gives a servo-effect. By contrast, a disc brake has no self-servo effect, and its braking force is always proportional to the pressure placed on the brake pad by the braking system via any brake servo, brake pedal, or lever. This tends to give the driver a better &quot;feel&quot; and helps to avoid impending lockup. Drums are also prone to &quot;bell mouthing&quot; and trap worn lining material within the assembly, causing various braking problems.

The disc is usually made of cast iron. In some cases, it may be made of composites such as reinforced carbon‚Äìcarbon or ceramic matrix composites. This is connected to the &quot;wheel&quot; and the &quot;axle&quot;. To slow down the wheel, friction material in the form of brake pads, mounted on the brake caliper, is forced mechanically, hydraulically, pneumatically, or electromagnetically against both sides of the disc. Friction causes the disc and attached wheel to slow or stop.

==Operation==

The brake disc is the rotating part of a wheel&#x27;s disc brake assembly, against which the brake pads are applied. The material is typically gray iron, a form of cast iron. The design of the discs varies. Some are solid, but others are hollowed out with fins or vanes joining the disc&#x27;s two contact surfaces (usually included in the casting process). The weight and power of the vehicle determine the need for ventilated discs. The &quot;ventilated&quot; disc design helps to dissipate the generated heat and is commonly used on the more heavily loaded front discs.

Discs for motorcycles, bicycles, and many cars often have holes or slots cut through the disc. This is done for better heat dissipation, to aid surface-water dispersal, to reduce noise, to reduce mass, or purely for non-functional aesthetics.

Slotted discs have shallow channels machined into the disc to aid in removing dust and gas. Slotting is preferred in most racing environments to remove gas and water and deglaze brake pads. Some discs are both drilled and slotted. Slotted discs are generally not used on standard vehicles because they quickly wear down brake pads; however, removing of material is beneficial to race vehicles since it keeps the pads soft and avoids vitrification of their surfaces. On the road, drilled or slotted discs still have a positive effect in wet conditions because the holes or slots prevent a film of water from building up between the disc and the pads.

Two-piece discs consist of a central section combined with a separately manufactured outer friction ring. The central section is often called a bell or hat because of its shape. It is commonly manufactured from an alloy such as a 7075 alloy and hard anodised for a lasting finish. The outer disc ring is usually made of grey iron. They can also be made of steel or carbon ceramic for particular applications. These materials originated from motorsport use and are available in high-performance vehicles and aftermarket upgrades. Two-piece discs can be supplied as a fixed assembly with regular nuts, bolts, and washers or a more complicated floating system where drive bobbins allow the two parts of the brake disc to expand and contract at different rates, therefore reducing the chance of a disc warping from overheating. Key advantages of a two-piece disc are a reduction of critical un-sprung weight and the dissipation of heat from the disc surface through the alloy bell (hat). Both fixed and floating options have their drawbacks and advantages. Floating discs are prone to rattle and collection of debris and are best suited to motorsport, whereas fixed discs are best for road use.

==History==
===Early experiments===
The development of disc brakes began in England in the 1890s. The first caliper-type automobile disc brake was patented by Frederick William Lanchester in his Birmingham factory in 1902 and used successfully on Lanchester cars. However, the limited choice of metals in this period meant he used copper as the braking medium acting on the disc. The poor state of the roads at this time, no more than dusty, rough tracks, meant that the copper wore quickly, making the system impractical.

In 1921, the Douglas motorcycle company introduced a form of disc brake on the front wheel of their overhead-valve sports models. Patented by the British Motorcycle &amp; Cycle-Car Research Association, Douglas described the device as a &quot;novel wedge brake&quot; working on a &quot;beveled hub flange&quot;. A Bowden cable operated the brake. Front and rear brakes of this type were fitted to the machine on which Tom Sheard rode to victory in the 1923 Senior TT.

Successful application began on railroad streamliner passenger trains, airplanes, and tanks before and during World War II. In the US, the Budd Company introduced disc brakes on the General Pershing Zephyr for the Burlington Railroad in 1938. By the early 1950s, disc brakes were regularly applied to new passenger rolling stock. In Britain, the Daimler Company used disc brakes on its Daimler Armoured Car of 1939. The disc brakes, made by the Girling company, were necessary because in that four-wheel drive (4√ó4) vehicle the epicyclic final drive was in the wheel hubs and therefore left no room for conventional hub-mounted drum brakes.

At Germany&#x27;s Argus Motoren, Hermann Klaue (1912-2001) had patented disc brakes in 1940. Argus supplied wheels fitted with disc brakes e.g. for the Arado Ar 96. The German Tiger I heavy tank, was introduced in 1942 with a 55¬†cm Argus-Werke disc on each drive shaft.

The American Crosley Hot Shot had four-wheel disc brakes in 1949 and 1950. However, these quickly proved troublesome and were removed. Crosley returned to drum brakes, and drum brake conversions for Hot Shots were popular. Lack of sufficient research caused reliability problems, such as sticking and corrosion, especially in regions using salt on winter roads. Crosley four-wheel disc brakes made the cars, and Crosley-based specials, popular in SCCA H-Production and H-modified racing in the 1950s. The Crosley disc was a Goodyear-Hawley design, a modern caliper &quot;spot&quot; type with a modern disc, derived from a design from aircraft applications.

Chrysler developed a unique braking system, offered from 1949 until 1953. Instead of the disc with caliper squeezing on it, this system used twin expanding discs that rubbed against the inner surface of a cast-iron brake drum, which doubled as the brake housing. The discs spread apart to create friction against the inner drum surface through the action of standard wheel cylinders. Because of the expense, the brakes were only standard on the Chrysler Crown and the Town and Country Newport in 1950. They were optional, however, on other Chryslers, priced around $400, at a time when an entire Crosley Hot Shot retailed for $935. This four-wheel disc brake system was built by Auto Specialties Manufacturing Company (Ausco) of St. Joseph, Michigan, under patents of inventor H.L. Lambert, and was first tested on a 1939 Plymouth. Chrysler discs were &quot;self-energizing,&quot; in that some of the braking energy itself contributed to the braking effort. This was accomplished by small balls set into oval holes leading to the braking surface. When the disc made initial contact with the friction surface, the balls would be forced up the holes forcing the discs further apart and augmenting the braking energy. This made for lighter braking pressure than with calipers, avoided brake fade, promoted cooler running, and provided one-third more friction surface than standard Chrysler twelve-inch drums. Today&#x27;s owners consider the Ausco-Lambert very reliable and powerful, but admit its grabbiness and sensitivity.

In 1953, 50 aluminum-bodied Austin-Healey 100S (Sebring) models, built primarily for racing, were the first European cars sold to the public to have disc brakes, fitted to all four wheels.

===First impact in racing===
The Jaguar C-Type racing car won the 1953 24 Hours of Le Mans, the only vehicle in the race to use disc brakes, developed in the UK by Dunlop, and the first car at Le Mans ever to average over 100¬†mph. &quot;Rivals&#x27; large drum brakes could match discs&#x27; ultimate stopping, but not their formidable staying power.&quot;

Before this, in 1950, a Crosley HotShot with stock four-wheel disc brakes won the Index of Performance in the first race at Sebring (six hours rather than 12) on New Year&#x27;s Eve in 1950.

===Mass production===
The Citro√´n DS was the first sustained mass production use of modern automotive disc brakes, in 1955. The car featured caliper-type front disc brakes among its many innovations. These discs were mounted inboard near the transmission and were powered by the vehicle&#x27;s central hydraulic system. This model went on to sell 1.5 million units over 20 years with the same brake setup.

Despite early experiments in 1902, from British Lanchester Motor Company, and in 1949 from Americans Chrysler and Crosley, the costly, trouble-prone technology was not ready for mass production. Attempts were soon withdrawn.

The Jensen 541, with four-wheel disc brakes, followed in 1956. Triumph exhibited a 1956 TR3 with disc brakes to the public, but the first production cars with Girling front-disc brakes were made in September 1956. Jaguar began to offer disc brakes in February 1957 on the XK150 model, soon to follow with the Mark 1 sports saloon and in 1959 with the Mark IX large saloon.

Disc brakes were most popular on sports cars when they were first introduced since these vehicles are more demanding about brake performance. Discs have now become the more common form in most passenger vehicles. However, many (lightweight vehicles) use drum brakes on the rear wheels to keep costs and weight down as well as to simplify the provisions for a parking brake. This can be a reasonable compromise because the front brakes perform most of the braking effort.

Many early implementations for automobiles located the brakes on the inboard side of the driveshaft, near the differential, while most brakes today are located inside the wheels. An inboard location reduces the unsprung weight and eliminates a source of heat transfer to the tires.

Historically, brake discs were manufactured worldwide with a concentration in Europe and America. Between 1989 and 2005, the manufacturing of brake discs migrated predominantly to China.

===In the U.S.===
In 1963, the Studebaker Avanti was factory-equipped with front disc brakes as standard equipment. This Bendix system licensed from Dunlop was also optional on some of the other Studebaker models. Front disc brakes became standard equipment on the 1965 Rambler Marlin. The Bendix units were optional on all American Motors&#x27; Rambler Classic and Ambassador models as well as on the Ford Thunderbird, and the Lincoln Continental. A four-wheel disc brake system was also introduced in 1965 on the Chevrolet Corvette Stingray. Most U.S. cars switched from front drum brakes to front disk brakes in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

===Motorcycles and scooters===

Lambretta introduced the first high-volume production use of a single, floating, front disc brake, enclosed in a ventilated cast alloy hub and actuated by cable, on the 1962 TV175. This was followed by the GT200 in 1964. 

MV Agusta was the second manufacturer to offer a front disc brake motorcycle to the public on a small scale in 1965, on their expensive 600 touring motorcycle featuring cable-operated mechanical actuation. In 1969, Honda introduced the more affordable CB750, which had a single hydraulically actuated front disc brake (and a rear drum brake), and which sold in huge numbers.

Unlike cars, disc brakes that are located within the wheel, bike disc brakes are in the airstream and have optimum cooling. Although cast iron discs have a porous surface that provides superior braking performance, such discs rust in the rain and become unsightly. Accordingly, motorcycle discs are usually stainless steel, drilled, slotted, or wavy to disperse rainwater. Modern motorcycle discs tend to have a floating design whereby the disc &quot;floats&quot; on bobbins and can move slightly, allowing better disc centering with a fixed caliper. A floating disc also avoids disc warping and reduces heat transfer to the wheel hub. 

Calipers have evolved from simple single-piston units to two-, four- and even six-piston items. Compared to cars, motorcycles have a higher center of mass:wheelbase ratio, so they experience more weight transfer when braking. Front brakes absorb most of the braking forces, while the rear brake serves mainly to balance the motorcycle during braking. Modern sports motorcycles typically have twin large front discs, with a much smaller single rear disc. Motorcycles that are particularly fast or heavy may have vented discs.

Early disc brakes (such as on the early Honda Fours and the Norton Commando) sited the calipers on top of the disc, ahead of the fork slider. Although this gave the brake pads better cooling, it is now almost universal practice to site the caliper behind the slider (to reduce the angular momentum of the fork assembly). Rear disc calipers may be mounted above (e.g. BMW R1100S) or below (e.g. Yamaha TRX850) the swinging arm: a low mount provides for a marginally lower center of gravity, while an upper siting keeps the caliper cleaner and better-protected from road obstacles.

One problem with motorcycle disc brakes is that when a motorcycle gets into a violent tank-slapper (high-speed oscillation of the front wheel) the brake pads in the calipers are forced away from the discs, so when the rider applies the brake lever, the caliper pistons push the pads towards the discs without actually making contact. The rider then brakes harder, forcing the pads onto the disc much more aggressively than standard braking. An example of this was the Michele Pirro incident at Mugello, Italy 1 June 2018. At least one manufacturer has developed a system to counter the pads being forced away.

A modern development, particularly on inverted (&quot;upside down&quot;, or &quot;USD&quot;) forks is the radially mounted caliper. Although these are fashionable, there is no evidence that they improve braking performance or add to the fork&#x27;s stiffness. (Lacking the option of a fork brace, USD forks may be best stiffened by an oversized front axle).

===Bicycles===


Bike disc brakes may range from simple, mechanical (cable) systems, to expensive and powerful, multi-piston hydraulic disc systems, commonly used on downhill racing bikes. Improved technology has seen the creation of vented discs for use on mountain bikes, similar to those on cars, introduced to help avoid heat fade on fast alpine descents. Discs are also used on road bicycles for all-weather cycling with predictable braking. By 2024, almost all road bikes are equipped with disc brakes, just like Mountain bikes. Drums are sometimes preferred as harder to damage in crowded parking, where discs are sometimes bent. Most bicycle brake discs are made of steel. Stainless steel is preferred due to its anti-rust properties. Discs are thin, often about 2¬†mm. Some use a two-piece floating disc style, others use a one-piece solid metal disc. Bicycle disc brakes use either a two-piston caliper that clamps the disc from both sides or a single-piston caliper with one moving pad that contacts the disc first, and then pushes the disc against the non-moving pad. Because energy efficiency is so important in bicycles, an uncommon feature of bicycle brakes is that the pads retract to eliminate residual drag when the brake is released. In contrast, most other brakes drag the pads lightly when released to minimize initial operational travel.

===Heavy vehicles===
Disc brakes are increasingly used on very large and heavy road vehicles, where previously large drum brakes were nearly universal. One reason is that the disc&#x27;s lack of self-assist makes brake force much more predictable, so peak brake force can be raised without more risk of braking-induced steering or jackknifing on articulated vehicles. Another is disc brakes fade less when hot, and in a heavy vehicle air and rolling drag and engine braking are small parts of total braking force, so brakes are used harder than on lighter vehicles, and drum brake fade can occur in a single stop. For these reasons, a heavy truck with disc brakes can stop in about 120% of the distance of a passenger car, but with drums, stopping takes about 150% of the distance. In Europe, stopping distance regulations essentially require disc brakes for heavy vehicles. In the U.S., drums are allowed and are typically preferred for their lower purchase price, despite higher total lifetime cost and more frequent service intervals.

=== Rail and aircraft ===
Still-larger discs are used for railroad cars, trams, and some airplanes. Passenger rail cars and light rail vehicles often use disc brakes outboard of the wheels, which helps ensure a free flow of cooling air. Some modern passenger rail cars, such as the Amfleet II cars, use inboard disc brakes. This reduces wear from debris and provides protection from rain and snow, which would make the discs slippery and unreliable. However, there is still plenty of cooling for reliable operation. Some airplanes have the brake mounted with very little cooling, and the brake gets hot when stopping. This is acceptable as there is sufficient time for cooling, where the maximum braking energy is very predictable. Should the braking energy exceed the maximum, for example during an emergency occurring during take-off, aircraft wheels can be fitted with a fusible plug to prevent the tire bursting. This is a milestone test in aircraft development.

=== Automotive use ===
For automotive use, disc brake discs are commonly made of grey iron. The SAE maintains a specification for the manufacture of grey iron for various applications. For normal car and light-truck applications, SAE specification J431 G3000 (superseded to G10) dictates the correct range of hardness, chemical composition, tensile strength, and other properties necessary for the intended use. Some racing cars and airplanes use brakes with carbon fiber discs and carbon fiber pads to reduce weight. Wear rates tend to be high, and braking may be poor or grabby until the brake is hot.

===Racing===
In racing and high-performance road cars, other disc materials have been employed. Reinforced carbon discs and pads inspired by aircraft braking systems such as those used on Concorde were introduced in Formula One by Brabham in conjunction with Dunlop in 1976. Carbon‚Äìcarbon braking is now used in most top-level motorsport worldwide, reducing unsprung weight, giving better frictional performance and improved structural properties at high temperatures, compared to cast iron. Carbon brakes have occasionally been applied to road cars, by the French Venturi sports car manufacturer in the mid-1990s for example, but need to reach a very high operating temperature before becoming truly effective and so are not well suited to road use. The extreme heat generated in these systems is visible during night racing, especially on shorter tracks. It is not uncommon to see the brake discs glowing red during use.

===Ceramic composites===


Ceramic discs are used in some high-performance cars and heavy vehicles.

The first development of the modern ceramic brake was made by British engineers for TGV applications in 1988. The objective was to reduce weight, and the number of brakes per axle, as well as provide stable friction from high speeds and all temperatures. The result was a carbon-fiber-reinforced ceramic process which is now used in various forms for automotive, railway, and aircraft brake applications.

Due to the high heat tolerance and mechanical strength of ceramic composite discs, they are often used on exotic vehicles where the cost is not prohibitive. They are also found in industrial applications where the ceramic disc&#x27;s lightweight and low-maintenance properties justify the cost. Composite brakes can withstand temperatures that would damage steel discs.

Porsche&#x27;s Composite Ceramic Brakes (PCCB) are siliconized carbon fiber, with high-temperature capability, a 50% weight reduction over iron discs (hence reducing the vehicle&#x27;s unsprung weight), a significant reduction in dust generation, substantially extended maintenance intervals, and enhanced durability in corrosive environments. Found on some of their more expensive models, it is also an optional brake for all street Porsches at added expense. They can be recognized by the bright yellow paintwork on the aluminum six-piston calipers. The discs are internally vented much like cast-iron ones, and cross-drilled.

===Adjustment mechanism===
In automotive applications, the piston seal has a square cross-section, also known as a square-cut seal.

As the piston moves in and out, the seal drags and stretches on the piston, causing the seal to twist. The seal distorts approximately 1/10 of a millimeter. The piston is allowed to move out freely, but the slight amount of drag caused by the seal stops the piston from fully retracting to its previous position when the brakes are released, and so takes up the slack caused by the wear of the brake pads, eliminating the need for return springs.

In some rear disc calipers, the parking brake activates a mechanism inside the caliper that performs some of the same functions.

===Disc damage modes===
Discs are usually damaged in one of four ways: scarring, cracking, warping, or excessive rusting. Service shops will sometimes respond to any disc problem by changing out the discs entirely, This is done mainly where the cost of a new disc may be lower than the cost of labor to resurface the old disc. Mechanically this is unnecessary unless the discs have reached the manufacturer&#x27;s minimum recommended thickness, which would make it unsafe to use them, or vane rusting is severe (ventilated discs only). Most leading vehicle manufacturers recommend brake disc skimming (US: turning) as a solution for lateral run-out, vibration issues, and brake noises. The machining process is performed in a brake lathe, which removes a very thin layer off the disc surface to clean off minor damage and restore uniform thickness. Machining the disc as necessary will maximize the mileage out of the current discs on the vehicle.

===Run-out===
Run-out is measured using a dial indicator on a fixed rigid base, with the tip perpendicular to the brake disc&#x27;s face. It is typically measured about from the outside diameter of the disc. The disc is spun. The difference between the minimum and maximum value on the dial is called lateral run-out. Typical hub/disc assembly run-out specifications for passenger vehicles are around . Runout can be caused either by deformation of the disc itself or by runout in the underlying wheel hub face or by contamination between the disc surface and the underlying hub mounting surface. Determining the root cause of the indicator displacement (lateral runout) requires the disassembly of the disc from the hub. Disc face runout due to hub face runout or contamination will typically have a period of 1 minimum and 1 maximum per revolution of the brake disc.

Discs can be machined to eliminate thickness variation and lateral run-out. Machining can be done in situ (on-car) or off-car (bench lathe). Both methods will eliminate the thickness variation. Machining on-car with the proper equipment can also eliminate lateral run-out due to hub-face non-perpendicularity.

Incorrect fitting can distort (warp) discs. The disc&#x27;s retaining bolts (or the wheel/lug nuts, if the disc is sandwiched in place by the wheel) must be tightened progressively and evenly. The use of air tools to fasten lug nuts can be bad practice unless a torque wrench is used for final tightening. The vehicle manual will indicate the proper pattern for tightening as well as a torque rating for the bolts. Lug nuts should never be tightened in a circle. Some vehicles are sensitive to the force the bolts apply and tightening should be done with a torque wrench.

Often uneven pad transfer is confused for disc warping. The majority of brake discs diagnosed as &quot;warped&quot; are the result of uneven transfer of pad material. Uneven pad transfer can lead to thickness variation of the disc. When the thicker section of the disc passes between the pads, the pads will move apart and the brake pedal will raise slightly; this is pedal pulsation. The thickness variation can be felt by the driver when it is approximately or greater (on automobile discs).

Thickness variation has many causes, but three primary mechanisms contribute to the propagation of disc thickness variations. The first is the improper selection of brake pads. Pads that are effective at low temperatures, such as when braking for the first time in cold weather, often are made of materials that decompose unevenly at higher temperatures. This uneven decomposition results in the uneven deposition of material onto the brake disc. Another cause of uneven material transfer is the improper break-in of a pad/disc combination. For proper break-in, the disc surface should be refreshed (either by machining the contact surface or by replacing the disc) every time the pads are changed. Once this is done, the brakes are heavily applied multiple times in succession. This creates a smooth, even interface between the pad and the disc. When this is not done properly the brake pads will see an uneven distribution of stress and heat, resulting in an uneven, seemingly random, deposition of pad material. The third primary mechanism of uneven pad material transfer is &quot;pad imprinting.&quot; This occurs when the brake pads are heated to the point that the material begins to break down and transfer to the disc. In a properly broken-in brake system (with properly selected pads), this transfer is natural and is a major contributor to the braking force generated by the brake pads. However, if the vehicle comes to a stop and the driver continues to apply the brakes, as is customary in cars with an automatic transmission, the pads will deposit a layer of material in the shape of the brake pad. This small thickness variation can begin the cycle of uneven pad transfer.

Once the disc has some level of variation in thickness, uneven pad deposition can accelerate, sometimes resulting in changes to the crystal structure of the metal that composes the disc. As the brakes are applied, the pads slide over the varying disc surface. As the pads pass by the thicker section of the disc, they are forced outwards. The foot of the driver applied to the brake pedal naturally resists this change, and thus more force is applied to the pads. The result is that the thicker sections see higher levels of stress. This causes uneven heating of the surface of the disc, which causes two major issues. As the brake disc heats unevenly it also expands unevenly. The thicker sections of the disc expand more than the thinner sections due to seeing more heat, and thus the difference in thickness is magnified. Also, the uneven distribution of heat results in the further uneven transfer of pad material. The result is that the thicker-hotter sections receive even more pad material than the thinner-cooler sections, contributing to a further increase in the variation in the disc&#x27;s thickness. In extreme situations, this uneven heating can cause the crystal structure of the disc material to change. When the hotter sections of the discs reach extremely high temperatures ( ), the metal can undergo a phase transformation and the carbon which is dissolved in the steel can precipitate out to form carbon-heavy carbide regions known as cementite. This iron carbide is very different from the cast iron the rest of the disc is composed of. It is extremely hard, brittle, and does not absorb heat well. After cementite is formed, the integrity of the disc is compromised. Even if the disc surface is machined, the cementite within the disc will not wear or absorb heat at the same rate as the cast iron surrounding it, causing the uneven thickness and heating characteristics of the disc to return.

===Scarring===
Scarring (US: Scoring) can occur if brake pads are not changed promptly when they reach the end of their service life and are considered worn out. Once enough of the friction material has worn away, the pad&#x27;s steel backing plate (for glued pads) or the pad retainer rivets (for riveted pads) will bear upon the disc&#x27;s wear surface, reducing braking power and making scratches on the disc. Generally, a moderately scarred or scored disc, which operated satisfactorily with existing brake pads, will be equally usable with new pads. If the scarring is deeper but not excessive, it can be repaired by machining off a layer of the disc&#x27;s surface. This can only be done a limited number of times as the disc has a minimum rated safe thickness. The minimum thickness value is typically cast into the disc during manufacturing on the hub or the edge of the disc. In Pennsylvania, which has one of the most rigorous auto safety inspection programs in North America, an automotive disc cannot pass a safety inspection if any scoring is deeper than , and must be replaced if machining will reduce the disc below its minimum safe thickness.

To prevent scarring, it is prudent to periodically inspect the brake pads for wear. A tire rotation is a logical time for inspection, since rotation must be performed regularly based on vehicle operation time and all wheels must be removed, allowing ready visual access to the brake pads. Some types of alloy wheels and brake arrangements will provide enough open space to view the pads without removing the wheel. When practical, pads that are near the wear-out point should be replaced immediately, as complete wear-out leads to scarring damage and unsafe braking. Many disc brake pads will include some sort of soft steel spring or drag tab as part of the pad assembly, which drags on the disc when the pad is nearly worn out. This produces a moderately loud squealing noise, alerting the driver that service is required. This will not normally scar the disc if the brakes are serviced promptly. A set of pads can be considered for replacement if the thickness of the pad material is the same or less than the thickness of the backing steel. In Pennsylvania, the standard is for riveted pads and 2/32&quot; for bonded pads.

===Cracking===
Cracking is limited mostly to drilled discs, which may develop small cracks around the edges of holes drilled near the edge of the disc due to the disc&#x27;s uneven rate of expansion in severe-duty environments. Manufacturers that use drilled discs as OEM typically do so for two reasons: appearance, if they determine that the average owner of the vehicle model will prefer the look while not overly stressing the hardware; or as a function of reducing the unsprung weight of the brake assembly, with the engineering assumption that enough brake disc mass remains to absorb racing temperatures and stresses. A brake disc is a heat sink, but the loss of heat sink mass may be balanced by increased surface area to radiate away heat. Small hairline cracks may appear in any cross-drilled metal disc as a normal wear mechanism, but in severe cases, the disc will fail catastrophically. No repair is possible for the cracks, and if the cracking becomes severe, the disc must be replaced. These cracks occur due to the phenomenon of low cycle fatigue as a result of repeated hard braking.

===Rusting===
The discs are commonly made from cast iron and a certain amount of surface rust is normal. The disc contact area for the brake pads will be kept clean by regular use, but a vehicle that is stored for an extended period can develop significant rust in the contact area that may reduce braking power for a time until the rusted layer is worn off again. Rusting can also lead to disc warping when brakes are re-activated after storage because of differential heating between unrusted areas left covered by pads and rust around the majority of the disc area surface. Over time, vented brake discs may develop severe rust corrosion inside the ventilation slots, compromising the strength of the structure and needing replacement.

==Calipers==

The brake caliper is the assembly that houses the brake pads and pistons. The pistons are usually made of plastic, aluminium or chrome-plated steel.

Calipers are of two types, floating or fixed. A fixed caliper does not move relative to the disc and is thus less tolerant of disc imperfections. It uses one or more pairs of opposing pistons to clamp from each side of the disc and is more complex and expensive than a floating caliper.

A floating caliper (also called a &quot;sliding caliper&quot;) moves side to side to the disc, along a line parallel to the axis of rotation of the disc; a piston on one side of the disc pushes the inner brake pad until it makes contact with the braking surface, then pulls the caliper body with the outer brake pad so the pressure is applied to both sides of the disc. Floating caliper (single piston) designs are subject to sticking failure, caused by dirt or corrosion entering at least one mounting mechanism and stopping its normal movement. This can lead to the caliper&#x27;s pads rubbing on the disc when the brake is not engaged or engaging it at an angle. Sticking can result from infrequent vehicle use, failure of a seal or rubber protection boot allowing debris entry, dry-out of the grease in the mounting mechanism, and subsequent moisture incursion leading to corrosion, or some combination of these factors. Consequences may include reduced fuel efficiency, extreme heating of the disc, or excessive wear on the affected pad. A sticking front caliper may also cause steering vibration.

Another type of floating caliper is a swinging caliper. Instead of a pair of horizontal bolts that allow the caliper to move straight in and out respective to the car body, a swinging caliper utilizes a single, vertical pivot bolt located somewhere behind the axle centerline. When the driver presses the brakes, the brake piston pushes on the inside piston and rotates the whole caliper inward, when viewed from the top. Because the swinging caliper&#x27;s piston angle changes relative to the disc, this design uses wedge-shaped pads that are narrower in the rear on the outside and narrower in the front on the inside.

Various types of brake calipers are also used on bicycle rim brakes.

===Pistons and cylinders===

The most common caliper design uses a single hydraulically actuated piston within a cylinder, although high-performance brakes use as many as twelve. Modern cars use different hydraulic circuits to actuate the brakes on each set of wheels as a safety measure. The hydraulic design also helps multiply braking force. The number of pistons in a caliper is often referred to as the number of &#x27;pots&#x27;, so if a vehicle has &#x27;six pot&#x27; calipers it means that each caliper houses six pistons.

Brake failure can result from the failure of the piston to retract, which is usually a consequence of not operating the vehicle during prolonged storage outdoors in adverse conditions. On high-mileage vehicles, the piston seals may leak, which must be promptly corrected.

==Brake pads==

Brake pads are designed for high friction with brake pad material embedded in the disc in the process of bedding while wearing evenly. Friction can be divided into two parts. They are: adhesive and abrasive.

Depending on the properties of the material of both the pad and the disc and the configuration and the usage, pad and disc wear rates will vary considerably. The properties that determine material wear involve trade-offs between performance and longevity.

The brake pads must usually be replaced regularly (depending on pad material and driving style), and some are equipped with a mechanism that alerts drivers that replacement is needed, such as a thin piece of soft metal that rubs against the disc when the pads are too thin causing the brakes to squeal, a soft metal tab embedded in the pad material that closes an electric circuit and lights a warning light when the brake pad gets thin, or an electronic sensor.

Generally, road-going vehicles have two brake pads per caliper, while up to six are installed on each racing caliper, with varying frictional properties in a staggered pattern for optimum performance.

Early brake pads (and linings) contained asbestos, producing dust that should not be inhaled. Although newer pads can be made of ceramics, Kevlar, and other plastics, inhalation of brake dust should still be avoided regardless of material.

==Common problems==
===Squeal===
Sometimes a loud noise or high-pitched squeal occurs when the brakes are applied. It mostly occurs on old cars and those who were produced or acquired some time ago. Most brake squeal is produced by vibration (resonance instability) of the brake components, especially the pads and discs (known as &quot;force-coupled excitation&quot;). This type of squeal should not negatively affect brake-stopping performance. Techniques include adding chamfer pads to the contact points between the caliper pistons and the pads, the bonding insulators (damping material) to the pad backplate, the brake shims between the brake pad and pistons, etc. All should be coated with an extremely high temperature, high solids lubricant to help reduce squeal. This allows the metal-to-metal parts to move independently of each other and thereby eliminate the buildup of energy that can create a frequency that is heard as brake squeal, groan, or growl. It is inherent that some pads are going to squeal more given the type of the pad and its usage case. Pads typically rated to withstand very high temperatures for extended periods tend to produce high amounts of friction leading to more noise during brake application.

Cold weather combined with high early-morning humidity (dew) often worsens brake squeal. However, the squeal generally stops when the lining reaches regular operating temperatures. This more strongly affects pads meant to be used at higher temperatures. Dust on the brakes may also cause squeal and commercial brake cleaning products are designed to remove dirt and other contaminants. Pads without a proper amount of transfer material could also squeal, this can be remedied by bedding or re-bedding the brake pads to brake discs.

Some lining wear indicators, located either as a semi-metallic layer within the brake pad material or with an external &quot;sensor&quot;, are also designed to squeal when the lining is due for replacement. The typical external sensor is fundamentally different from the noises described above (when the brakes are applied) because the wear sensor noise typically occurs when the brakes are not used. The wear sensor may only create a squeal under braking when it first begins to indicate wear but is still a fundamentally different sound and pitch.

===Judder or shimmy===
A brake judder is usually perceived by the driver as minor to severe vibrations transferred through the chassis during braking.

The judder phenomenon can be classified into two distinct subgroups: &quot;hot&quot; (or &quot;thermal&quot;), or &quot;cold&quot; judder.

Hot judder is usually produced as a result of longer, more moderate braking from high speed where the vehicle does not come to a complete stop. It commonly occurs when a motorist decelerates from speeds of around to about , which results in severe vibrations being transmitted to the driver. These vibrations are the result of uneven thermal distributions, or &quot;hot spots&quot;. Hot spots are classified as concentrated thermal regions that alternate between both sides of a disc that distort it in such a way that produces a sinusoidal waviness around its edges. Once the brake pads (friction material/brake lining) come in contact with the sinusoidal surface during braking, severe vibrations are induced, and can produce hazardous conditions for the person driving the vehicle.

Cold judder, on the other hand, is the result of uneven disc wear patterns or disc thickness variation (DTV). These variations in the disc surface are usually the result of extensive vehicle road usage. DTV is usually attributed to the following causes: waviness and roughness of disc surface, misalignment of axis run-out, elastic deflection, wear and friction material transfers.
Either type could potentially be fixed by ensuring a clean mounting surface on either side of the brake disc between the wheel hub and brake disc hub before usage and paying attention to imprinting after extended usage by leaving the brake pedal heavily depressed at the end of heavy usage. Sometimes a bed in procedure can clean and minimize DTV and lay a new even transfer layer between the pad and brake disc. However, it will not eliminate hot spots or excessive run-out.

===Dust===
When braking force is applied, the act of abrasive friction between the brake pad and the disc wears both the disc and pad away. The brake dust that is seen deposited on wheels, calipers, and other braking system components consists mostly of the disc material. Brake dust can damage the finish of most wheels if not washed off. Generally, a brake pad that aggressively abrades more disc material away, such as metallic pads, will create more brake dust. Some higher-performing pads for track use or towing use may wear away much quicker than a typical pad, thus causing more dust due to the increased brake disc and brake pad wear.

===Brake fade===
Brake fade is a phenomenon that decreases braking efficiency. It causes the braking power to reduce and you feel that the brakes are not being applied with the force they were being applied at the time of starting. This occurs due to the heating of brake pads. The heated brake pads emit some gaseous substances which cover the area between the disc and the brake pads. These gases disturb the contact between the brake pads and the disc and hence decrease the braking effectiveness.

<text>Mission Basilica San Diego de Alcal√° (, lit. The Mission of Saint Didacus of Acal√°) was the second Franciscan founded mission in the Californias (after San Fernando de Velicata), a province of New Spain. Located in present-day San Diego, California, it was founded on July 16, 1769, by Spanish friar Jun√≠pero Serra, in an area long inhabited by the Kumeyaay people. The current church, built in the early 19th century, is the fifth to stand on this location. The mission site is a National Historic Landmark.

The mission and the surrounding area were named for the Catholic saint Didacus of Alcal√°, a Spaniard more commonly known as &quot;San Diego&quot;. The mission was the site of the first Christian burial in Alta California. The original mission burned in 1775 during an uprising by local natives. San Diego is also generally regarded as the site of the region&#x27;s first public execution, in 1778. Father Luis Jayme, California&#x27;s first Christian martyr who was among those killed during the 1775 uprising against the mission, lies entombed beneath the chancel floor.

==History==
The former Spanish settlement at the Kumeyaay &quot;Nipawai&quot; lies within that area occupied during the late Paleoindian period and continuing into the present day by the Native society commonly known as the &quot;Diegue√±o&quot;; the name denotes those people who were ministered by the padres at Mission San Diego de Alcal√°. Relatively, much is known about the native inhabitants in recent centuries, thanks in part to the efforts of Juan Rodr√≠guez Cabrillo, who explored the coast in the service of Spain. He documented his in the coastal villages he encountered along the Southern California coast in October 1542. Cabrillo was the first European to set foot in what is now the state of California and the first to encounter San Diego Bay. On the evening of September 28, 1542, the ships &quot;San Salvador&quot; and &quot;Victoria&quot; sailed into the harbor, whereupon Cabrillo christened it &quot;San Miguel&quot;. During that expedition a landing party went ashore and briefly interacted with a small group of natives. Some sixty years later another Spanish explorer, Sebasti√°n Vizca√≠no, made landfall some ten miles from the present Mission site. Under Vizca√≠no&#x27;s command the &quot;San Diego&quot;, &quot;Santo Tom√°s&quot;, and frigate &quot;Tres Reyes&quot; dropped anchor on November 10, 1602, and the port was renamed &quot;San Diego de Alcal√°&quot;. It would be another 167 years before the Spanish returned to San Diego.

Ever since the voyages of Christopher Columbus, the Kingdom of Spain sought to establish missions to convert the pagans in &quot;Nueva Espa√±a&quot; (&quot;New Spain&quot;) to Roman Catholicism to save souls and to facilitate colonization of these lands. However, it was not until 1741‚Äîthe time of the Vitus Bering expedition, when the territorial ambitions of Tsarist Russia towards North America became known‚Äîthat King Philip V felt such installations were necessary for Upper California. In 1769, &quot;Visitador General&quot; Jos√© de G√°lvez sent the expedition of Jun√≠pero Serra and Gaspar de Portol√† to found missions and presidios at San Diego and Monterey (see Timeline of the Portol√† expedition), thereby securing Spain&#x27;s claim to the Pacific coast harbors recommended by Cabrillo and Vizcaino. Two groups traveled from Lower California on foot, while a pair of packet ships (bearing supplies) traveled up the coast from the Baja California peninsula.

The original mission church was destroyed by fire in 1775 during an uprising by local indigenous people. An estimated 800 &quot;American Indians&quot; pillaged the mission, burned it to the ground and massacred a blacksmith, a carpenter (mortally wounded), and Father Jayme, who became California&#x27;s first Catholic Martyr. Father Jayme is buried next to the altar in the present church. Survivors of the night-long attack were one corporal and three Leather Jacket soldiers, one blacksmith, two children who were the son and nephew of the Presidio commandant, and Associate Pastor Father Vicente Fuster. Father Serra then returned to the site of the original structure in 1776 to oversee the rebuilding of the mission. However, the scarce amount of water and the difficulty of making the land until (feasible for preparing crops to be planted by plowing and fertilizing) made the re-establishment of the mission a long and difficult process. From 1778 to 1795, the mission focused on horse and mule breeding, providing other missions in Alta and Baja California an average of 16 animals per year. After it was restored as a Catholic mission, Mission San Diego de Alcal√° saw a record number of spiritual results recorded when 567 baptisms were performed, and neophytes numbered 908.

===Rancho period (1834‚Äì1849)===
On August 9, 1834, Governor Figueroa issued his &quot;Decree of Confiscation&quot;. The missions were offered for sale to citizens, who were unable to come up with the price, so all mission property was broken up into &quot;ranchos&quot; and given to ex-military officers who had fought in the War of Independence against Spain. On June 8, 1846, Mission San Diego de Alcal√° was given to Santiago Arg√ºello by Governor P√≠o Pico &quot;for services rendered to the government.&quot; After the United States invaded California, the Mission was used by the military from 1846 to 1862.
===California statehood (1850‚Äì1900)===
President Abraham Lincoln signed a proclamation on May 23, 1862, that restored ownership of the Mission proper to the Roman Catholic Church. When Mission San Diego de Alcal√° was granted back to the Church, it was in ruins. In the 1880s Father Anthony Ubach began to restore the old Mission buildings.

===20th century and beyond (1901 ‚Äì present)===
Father Ubach died in 1907 and restoration work ceased until 1931. In 1941, the Mission once again became a parish church, in what is still an active parish serving the Diocese of San Diego. In 1976, Pope Paul VI designated the Mission church as a minor basilica.

Mission San Diego de Alcal√° is located within San Diego city limits, near the intersection of Interstate 8 and Interstate 15, and approximately one mile east of Snapdragon Stadium.

==Mission industries==
The goal of the missions was, above all, to become self-sufficient in relatively short order. Farming, therefore, was the most important industry of any mission. Before the establishment of the missions, the native peoples knew how to utilize bone, seashells, stone, and wood for building, tool making, weapons, and much more. The missionaries discovered that the Indians, who regarded labor as degrading to men, had to be taught industry to learn how to be self-supportive. The result was the establishment of a manual training school that comprised agriculture, the mechanical arts, and the raising and care of livestock. Everything consumed and otherwise utilized by the natives was produced at the missions under the supervision of the padres; thus, the neophytes not only supported themselves, but after 1811 sustained the entire military and civil government of California. Wheat, corn, wine grapes, barley, beans, cattle, horses, and sheep were the major crops at San Diego. In 1795, construction on a system of aqueducts was begun to bring water to the fields and the Mission (the first irrigation project in Upper California). The building manager was Fray Pedro Panto, who was poisoned by his Indian cook &quot;Nazario&quot; before the project was completed. In his testimony, in the trial that followed, Nazario stated that he had poisoned the friar due to constant beatings inflicted by Friar Panto.

The Mission San Diego was primarily supported from lands included in a Spanish royal land grant, encompassing roughly the eastern third of the current City of San Diego, as well as most of the cities of La Mesa and Lemon Grove. While not exact, its boundaries are roughly Interstate 805, Miramar Road, California State Route 125, Skyline Drive, and Division Street. Boundary Street (which parallels Interstate 805 in the neighborhood of North Park) lies directly on one portion of the boundary and draws its name from it.

===Wine===

The first vineyards planted in California were planted at the mission in 1769. Father Jun√≠pero Serra planted these initial vines. The vines were of the Mission variety, which were brought to Mexico in the 16th century. Unfortunately, the initial plantings did not survive, with Mission San Juan Capistrano having the first surviving plantings. By at least 1781, wine was being produced at the mission. One source claims that the vineyard on mission lands reached up to fifty thousand acres. The mission vineyards were around until at least 1823.

<text>Henry Charles Bukowski ( ; born Heinrich Karl Bukowski, ; August 16, 1920 ‚Äì March 9, 1994) was a German-American poet, novelist, and short story writer. His writing was influenced by the social, cultural, and economic ambience of his adopted home city of Los Angeles. Bukowski&#x27;s work addresses the ordinary lives of poor Americans, the act of writing, alcohol, relationships with women, and the drudgery of work. The FBI kept a file on him as a result of his column &quot;Notes of a Dirty Old Man&quot; in the LA underground newspaper &quot;Open City&quot;.

Bukowski published extensively in small literary magazines and with small presses beginning in the early 1940s and continuing on through the early 1990s. He wrote thousands of poems, hundreds of short stories and six novels, eventually publishing over sixty books during the course of his career. Some of these works include his &quot;Poems Written Before Jumping Out of an 8 Story Window&quot;, published by his friend and fellow poet Charles Potts, and better-known works such as &quot;Burning in Water, Drowning in Flame&quot;. These poems and stories were later republished by John Martin&#x27;s Black Sparrow Press (now HarperCollins/Ecco Press) as collected volumes of his work. As noted by one reviewer, &quot;Bukowski continued to be, thanks to his antics and deliberate clownish performances, the king of the underground and the epitome of the littles in the ensuing decades, stressing his loyalty to those small press editors who had first championed his work and consolidating his presence in new ventures such as the &quot;New York Quarterly&quot;, &quot;Chiron Review&quot;, or &quot;Slipstream&quot;.&quot;

In 1986, &quot;Time&quot; called Bukowski a &quot;laureate of American lowlife&quot;. Regarding his enduring popular appeal, Adam Kirsch of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote, &quot;the secret of Bukowski&#x27;s appeal ... [is that] he combines the confessional poet&#x27;s promise of intimacy with the larger-than-life aplomb of a pulp-fiction hero.&quot;

During his lifetime, Bukowski received little attention from academic critics in the United States, but was better received in Europe, particularly the UK, and especially Germany, where he was born. Since his death in March 1994, Bukowski has been the subject of a number of critical articles and books about both his life and writings.

== Biography ==

=== Family and early years ===

Charles Bukowski was born Heinrich Karl Bukowski in Andernach, Prussia, Weimar Germany. His father was Heinrich (Henry) Bukowski, an American of German descent who had served in the U.S. army of occupation after World War I and had remained in Germany after his army service. His mother was Katharina (n√©e Fett). His paternal grandfather, Leonard Bukowski, had moved to the United States from Imperial Germany in the 1880s. In Cleveland, Ohio, Leonard met Emilie Krause, an ethnic German, who had emigrated from Danzig (now Gda≈Ñsk, Poland). They married and settled in Pasadena, California, where Leonard worked as a successful carpenter. The couple had four children, including Heinrich (Henry), Charles Bukowski&#x27;s father. His mother, Katharina Bukowski, was the daughter of Wilhelm Fett and Nannette Israel. The name &quot;Israel&quot; is widespread among Catholics in the Eifel region. Bukowski assumed his paternal ancestor had moved from Poland to Germany around 1780, as &quot;Bukowski&quot; is a Polish last name. As far back as Bukowski could trace, his whole family was German.

Bukowski&#x27;s parents met in Andernach following World War I. His father was German-American and a sergeant in the United States Army serving in Germany after the empire&#x27;s defeat in 1918. He had an affair with Katharina, a German friend&#x27;s sister, and she subsequently became pregnant. Bukowski repeatedly claimed to be born out of wedlock, but Andernach marital records indicate that his parents married one month before his birth. Afterwards, Bukowski&#x27;s father became a building contractor, set to make great financial gains in the aftermath of the war, and after two years moved the family to Pfaffendorf (today part of Koblenz). However, given the crippling postwar reparations being required of Germany, which led to a stagnant economy and high levels of inflation, he was unable to make a living and decided to move the family to the U.S. On April 18, 1923, they sailed from Bremerhaven to Baltimore, Maryland, where they settled.

His family moved to Mid-City, Los Angeles, in 1930. Bukowski&#x27;s father was often unemployed. In the autobiographical &quot;Ham on Rye&quot;, Bukowski says that, with his mother&#x27;s acquiescence, his father was frequently abusive, both physically and mentally, beating his son for the smallest imagined offense. He later told an interviewer that his father beat him with a razor strop three times a week from the ages of six to 11 years. He says that it helped his writing, as he came to understand undeserved pain.

Young Bukowski spoke English with a strong German accent and was taunted by his childhood playmates with the epithet &quot;Heini,&quot; German diminutive of Heinrich, in his early youth. He was shy and socially withdrawn, a condition exacerbated during his teen years by an extreme case of acne. Neighborhood children ridiculed his accent and the clothing his parents made him wear. The Great Depression bolstered his rage as he grew, and gave him much of his voice and material for his writings.

In his early teen years, Bukowski had an epiphany when he was introduced to alcohol by his friend William &quot;Baldy&quot; Mullinax, depicted as &quot;Eli LaCrosse&quot; in &quot;Ham on Rye&quot;, son of an alcoholic surgeon. &quot;This [alcohol] is going to help me for a very long time,&quot; he later wrote, describing a method (drinking) he could use to come to more amicable terms with his own life. Bukowski attended Susan Miller Dorsey High School for one year before transferring to Los Angeles High School. After graduating from high school in 1939, Bukowski attended Los Angeles City College for two years, taking courses in art, journalism, and literature, before quitting at the start of World War II. He then moved to New York City to begin a career as a financially pinched blue-collar worker with hopes of becoming a writer.

On July 22, 1944, with the war ongoing, Bukowski was arrested by FBI agents in Philadelphia, where he lived at the time, on suspicion of draft evasion. At a time when the U.S. was at war with Nazi Germany, and many Germans and German-Americans on the home front were suspected of disloyalty, Bukowski&#x27;s German birth troubled the authorities. He was held for seventeen days in Philadelphia&#x27;s Moyamensing Prison. Sixteen days later, he failed a psychological examination that was part of his mandatory military entrance physical test and was given a Selective Service Classification of 4-F (unfit for military service).

=== Early writing ===
When Bukowski was aged 23 (March-April 1944), his short story &quot;Aftermath of a Lengthy Rejection Slip&quot; was published in &quot;Story&quot; magazine. Two years later, another short story, &quot;20 Tanks from Kasseldown&quot;, was published by the Black Sun Press in Issue III of &quot;&quot;, a limited-run, loose-leaf broadside collection printed in 1946 and edited by Caresse Crosby. Failing to break into the literary world, Bukowski grew disillusioned with the publication process and quit writing for almost a decade, a time that he referred to as a &quot;ten-year drunk&quot;. These &quot;lost years&quot; formed the basis for his later semiautobiographical chronicles, and there are fictionalized versions of Bukowski&#x27;s life through his highly stylized alter-ego, Henry Chinaski. However, Bukowski never fully gave up writing and had occasional pieces published during this period. The ‚Äúten-year drunk‚Äù was part of the Chinaski Legend, similar to Jack Kerouac‚Äôs Duluoz Legend. 

During part of this period he continued living in Los Angeles, working at a pickle factory for a short time but also spending some time roaming about the U.S., working sporadically and staying in cheap rooming houses. In the early 1950s, he took a job as a fill-in letter carrier with the United States Post Office Department in Los Angeles, but resigned just before he reached three years&#x27; service.

In the spring of 1954, Bukowski was treated for a near-fatal bleeding ulcer. After leaving the hospital he began to write poetry. The next year he agreed to marry small-town Texas poet Barbara Frye, but they divorced in 1958. According to Howard Sounes&#x27;s &quot;Charles Bukowski: Locked in the Arms of a Crazy Life&quot;, she later died under mysterious circumstances in India. Following his divorce, Bukowski resumed drinking and continued writing poetry.

Several of Bukowski&#x27;s poems were published in the late 1950s in &quot;Gallows&quot;, a small poetry magazine published briefly (the magazine lasted for two issues) by Jon Griffith. The small &quot;avant-garde&quot; literary magazine &quot;Nomad&quot;, published by Anthony Linick and Donald Factor (the son of Max Factor Jr.), offered a home to Bukowski&#x27;s early work. &quot;Nomad&quot;‚Ä≥s inaugural issue in 1959 featured two of his poems. A year later, &quot;Nomad&quot; published one of Bukowski&#x27;s best-known essays, &quot;Manifesto: A Call for Our Own Critics&quot;.

=== 1960s ===
By 1960, Bukowski had returned to the post office in Los Angeles and began work as a letter filing clerk, a position he held for more than a decade. In 1962, he was distraught over the death of Jane Cooney Baker, his first serious girlfriend. Bukowski turned his inner devastation into a series of poems and stories lamenting her death.
E.V. Griffith, editor of Hearse Press, published Bukowski&#x27;s first separately printed publication, a broadside titled &quot;His Wife, the Painter,&quot; in June 1960. This event was followed by Hearse Press&#x27;s publication of &quot;Flower, Fist and Bestial Wail,&quot; Bukowski&#x27;s first chapbook of poems, in October 1960. &quot;His Wife, the Painter&quot; and three other broadsides (&quot;The Paper on the Floor&quot;, &quot;The Old Man on the Corner&quot; and &quot;Waste Basket&quot;) formed the centerpiece of Hearse Press&#x27;s &quot;Coffin 1&quot;, an innovative small-poetry publication consisting of a pocketed folder containing forty-two broadsides and lithographs which was published in 1964. Hearse Press continued to publish poems by Bukowski through the 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s.

Jon and Louise Webb, publishers of the literary magazine &quot;The Outsider&quot;, featured some of Bukowski&#x27;s poetry in its pages. Under the Loujon Press imprint, the Webbs published Bukowski&#x27;s &quot;It Catches My Heart in Its Hands&quot; in 1963 and &quot;Crucifix in a Deathhand&quot; in 1965.

In 1964 a daughter, Marina Louise Bukowski, was born to Bukowski and his live-in girlfriend Frances Smith. She would be his only child.

Beginning in 1967, Bukowski wrote the column &quot;Notes of a Dirty Old Man&quot; for Los Angeles&#x27; &quot;Open City&quot;, an underground newspaper. When &quot;Open City&quot; was shut down in 1969, the column was picked up by the &quot;Los Angeles Free Press&quot; as well as the hippie underground paper &quot;NOLA Express&quot; in New Orleans. In 1969, Bukowski and Neeli Cherkovski launched their own short-lived mimeographed literary magazine, &quot;Laugh Literary and Man the Humping Guns&quot;. They produced three issues over the next two years.

=== Black Sparrow years ===
In 1969, Bukowski accepted an offer from Black Sparrow Press publisher John Martin and quit his post office job to dedicate himself to full-time writing. He was then 49 years old. As he explained in a letter at the time, &quot;I have one of two choices ‚Äì stay in the post office and go crazy ... or stay out here and play at writer and starve. I have decided to starve.&quot; Less than one month after leaving the postal service he finished his first novel, &quot;Post Office&quot;. As a measure of respect for Martin&#x27;s financial support and faith in a relatively unknown writer, Bukowski published almost all of his subsequent major works with Black Sparrow Press, which became a highly successful enterprise. An avid supporter of small independent presses, Bukowski continued to submit poems and short stories to innumerable small publications throughout his career.

Bukowski embarked on a series of love affairs and one-night trysts. One of these relationships was with Linda King, a sculptor and poet. Critic Robert Peters reported seeing Bukowski as an actor in King&#x27;s play &quot;Only a Tenant&quot;, in which she and Bukowski stage-read the first act at the Pasadena Museum of the Artist. This was a one-off performance of what was a shambolic work. Bukowski&#x27;s other affairs were with a recording executive and a twenty-three-year-old redhead; he wrote a book of poetry as a tribute to his love for the latter, titled, &quot;Scarlet&quot; (Black Sparrow Press, 1976). His various affairs and relationships provided material for his stories and poems. Another important relationship was with &quot;Tanya&quot;, pseudonym of &quot;Amber O&#x27;Neil&quot; (also a pseudonym), described in Bukowski&#x27;s &quot;Women&quot; as a pen-pal that evolved into a weekend tryst at Bukowski&#x27;s residence in Los Angeles in the 1970s. &quot;Amber O&#x27;Neil&quot; later self-published a chapbook about the affair entitled &quot;Blowing My Hero&quot;.

In 1976, Bukowski met Linda Lee Beighle, a health food restaurant owner, rock-and-roll groupie, aspiring actress, heiress to a small Philadelphia &quot;Main Line&quot; fortune and devotee of Meher Baba. Two years later he moved from the East Hollywood area, where he had lived for most of his life, to the harborside community of San Pedro, the southernmost district of Los Angeles. Beighle followed him and they lived together intermittently over the next two years. They were eventually married by Manly Palmer Hall, a Canadian-born author, mystic, and spiritual teacher, in 1985. Beighle is referred to as &quot;Sara&quot; in Bukowski&#x27;s novels &quot;Women&quot; and &quot;Hollywood&quot;.

In the 1980s, Bukowski collaborated with cartoonist Robert Crumb on a series of comic books, with Bukowski supplying the writing and Crumb providing the artwork. Through the 1990s Crumb also illustrated a number of Bukowski&#x27;s stories, including the collection &quot;The Captain Is Out to Lunch and the Sailors Have Taken Over the Ship&quot; and the story &quot;Bring Me Your Love&quot;.

Bukowski was also published in &quot;Beloit Poetry Journal&quot;.

===Live poetry readings===

Bukowski&#x27;s live readings were legendary, with the drunk raucous crowd fighting with the drunk angry poet. In 1972, Joe Wolberg, who was the manager of City Lights Books in San Francisco, rented a hall and paid Bukowski to read his poems. A vinyl album was released by City Lights, which was re-issued by Takoma Records in 1980.

In May 1978, Bukowski traveled to West Germany and gave a live poetry reading of his work before an audience in Hamburg. This was released as a double 12&quot; L.P. stereo record titled &quot;CHARLES BUKOWSKI &#x27;Hello. It&#x27;s good to be back.

His last international performance was in October 1979 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, and was released on DVD as &quot;There&#x27;s Gonna Be a God Damn Riot in Here&quot;. The reading was produced by fan/friend Dennis Del Torre, who rented a venue, Viking Hall, paid Bukowski and his wife Linda to fly up, hired a video crew, promoted the event, and sold tickets. The crowd and Bukowski were very drunk for the event. A heckler was near the stage and can be heard clearly. Del Torre later went to Bukowski&#x27;s widow, Linda Bukowski, for permission to license it. He thought it was the last reading Bukowski gave, but Linda told him there was another reading after that in Redondo Beach, CA, in early 1980.

In March 1980 he gave his very last reading at the Sweetwater music venue in Redondo Beach, California, which was released as &quot;Hostage&quot; on vinyl and audio CD, and &quot;The Last Straw&quot; on DVD, filmed and produced by Jon Monday for mondayMEDIA. In 2010 the unedited versions of both &quot;The Last Straw&quot; and &quot;Riot&quot; were released as &quot;One Tough Mother&quot; on DVD.

=== Death and legacy ===

Bukowski died of leukemia on March 9, 1994, in San Pedro, aged 73, shortly after completing his last novel, &quot;Pulp&quot;. The funeral rites, orchestrated by his widow, were conducted by Buddhist monks. He is interred at Green Hills Memorial Park in Rancho Palos Verdes. An account of the proceedings can be found in Gerald Locklin&#x27;s book &quot;Charles Bukowski: A Sure Bet&quot;. His gravestone reads: &quot;Don&#x27;t Try&quot;, a phrase which Bukowski uses in one of his poems, advising aspiring writers and poets about inspiration and creativity. Bukowski explained the phrase in a 1963 letter to John William Corrington: &quot;Somebody at one of these places [...] asked me: &#x27;What do you do? How do you write, create?&#x27; You don&#x27;t, I told them. You don&#x27;t try. That&#x27;s very important: &quot;not&quot; to try, either for Cadillacs, creation or immortality. You wait, and if nothing happens, you wait some more. It&#x27;s like a bug high on the wall. You wait for it to come to you. When it gets close enough you reach out, slap out and kill it. Or, if you like its looks, you make a pet out of it.&quot;

Bukowski&#x27;s work was subject to controversy throughout his career. Hugh Fox claimed that his sexism in his poetry, at least in part, translated into his life. In 1969, Fox published the first critical study of Bukowski in &quot;The North American Review&quot;, and mentioned his attitude toward women: &quot;When women are around, he has to play Man. In a way it&#x27;s the same kind of &#x27;pose&#x27; he plays at in his poetry‚ÄîBogart, Eric Von Stroheim. Whenever my wife Lucia would come with me to visit him he&#x27;d play the Man role, but one night she couldn&#x27;t come I got to Buk&#x27;s place and found a whole different guy‚Äîeasy to get along with, relaxed, accessible.&quot;

In June 2006, Bukowski&#x27;s literary archive was donated by his widow to the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. Copies of all editions of his work published by the Black Sparrow Press are held at Western Michigan University, which purchased the archive of the publishing house after its closure in 2003.

Ecco Press continues to release new collections of his poetry, culled from the thousands of works published in small literary magazines. According to Ecco Press, the 2007 release &quot;The People Look Like Flowers at Last&quot; will be his final posthumous release, as now all his once-unpublished work has been made available.

== Writing ==
Writers including John Fante, Knut Hamsun, Louis-Ferdinand C√©line, Ernest Hemingway, Robinson Jeffers, Henry Miller, D. H. Lawrence, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Du Fu Li Bai, and James Thurber are noted as influences on Bukowski&#x27;s writing.

Bukowski often spoke of Los Angeles as his favorite subject. In a 1974 interview he said, &quot;You live in a town all your life, and you get to know every bitch on the street corner and half of them you have already messed around with. You&#x27;ve got the layout of the whole land. You have a picture of where you are... Since I was raised in L.A., I&#x27;ve always had the geographical and spiritual feeling of being here. I&#x27;ve had time to learn this city. I can&#x27;t see any other place than L.A.&quot;

Bukowski also performed live readings of his works, beginning in 1962 on radio station KPFK in Los Angeles and increasing in frequency through the 1970s. Drinking was often a featured part of the readings, along with a combative banter with the audience. Bukowski could also be generous; for example, after a sold-out show at Amazingrace Coffeehouse in Evanston, Illinois, on November 18, 1975, he signed and illustrated over 100 copies of his poem &quot;Winter,&quot; published by No Mountains Poetry Project. By the late 1970s, Bukowski&#x27;s income was sufficient to give up live readings.

One critic has described Bukowski&#x27;s fiction as a &quot;detailed depiction of a certain taboo male fantasy: the uninhibited bachelor, slobby, anti-social, and utterly free&quot;, an image he tried to live up to with sometimes riotous public poetry readings and boorish party behavior.
A few critics and commentators also supported the idea that Bukowski was a cynic, as a man and a writer. Bukowski denied being a cynic, stating: &quot;I&#x27;ve always been accused of being a cynic. I think cynicism is sour grapes. I think cynicism is a weakness.&quot;

=== Poetry editorial controversy ===
Over half of Bukowski&#x27;s collections have been published posthumously. Posthumous collections have been known to have been &#x27;John Martinized&#x27; , with the poems having been highly edited, at a level which was not present during Bukowski&#x27;s lifetime. One example of a popular poem, &quot;Roll the Dice&quot; (when comparing the original manuscript to &quot;What Matters Most Is How Well You Walk Through the Fire&quot;), themes such as hell and alcoholism are removed. The creative editing present includes changing lines from &quot;against total rejection and the highest of odds&quot; to &quot;despite rejection and the worst odds&quot;.

=== In film ===
* In 1981, the Italian director Marco Ferreri made a film, &quot;Storie di ordinaria follia&quot; (aka &quot;Tales of Ordinary Madness&quot;), loosely based on the short stories of Bukowski; Ben Gazzara played the role of Bukowski&#x27;s character.
* &quot;Barfly&quot;, released in 1987, is a semi-autobiographical film written by Bukowski and starring Mickey Rourke as Henry Chinaski, who represents Bukowski, and Faye Dunaway as his lover Wanda Wilcox. Sean Penn offered to play Chinaski for one dollar as long as his friend Dennis Hopper would direct, but the European director Barbet Schroeder had invested many years and thousands of dollars in the project and Bukowski felt Schroeder deserved to make it. Bukowski wrote the screenplay, was given script approval, and appears as a bar patron in a brief cameo.

In April 2014, producer Cyril Humphris sued Franco, claiming that the film was an unauthorized adaptation of Bukowski&#x27;s &quot;Ham on Rye&quot;, to which Humphris had the film rights. The lawsuit was eventually settled in October 2014. As of 2024, the film has yet to be released.

<text>German submarine &quot;U-760&quot; was a Type VIIC U-boat of Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; during World War II.

Her keel was laid down 5¬†August 1940 by the Kriegsmarinewerft of Wilhelmshaven, and she was commissioned 15¬†October 1942 with &quot;Oberleutnant zur See&quot; Otto-Ulrich Blum in command. Blum commanded her for her entire career in the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;.

==Design==
German Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines. &quot;U-760&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Garbe, Lahmeyer &amp; Co. RP 137/c double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-760&quot; was fitted with five torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen torpedoes, one SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and two twin C/30 anti-aircraft guns. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty.

==Service history==
&quot;U-760&quot; conducted two war patrols, but never sank or damaged a ship. On 26 February 1943 &quot;Obermaschinist&quot; Jakob Ippendorf died during an air attack in Wilhelmshaven. On 12 August 1943 &quot;Matrosenenobergefreiter&quot; G√ºnter Werner was lost during an air attack in the North Atlantic.

On 8 September 1943, about off Cape Finisterre, &quot;U-760&quot; was sailing on the surface alongside when they were attacked by Allied aircraft. &quot;U-760&quot; fled into Vigo harbour and was taken under the guns of the .

===Fate===
International neutrality agreements allowed ships to spend up to 24 hours in neutral harbours to make emergency repairs, but &quot;U-760&quot; was unable to get underway in time. She was interned at Ferrol for the remainder of World War II. The submarine engine was dismantled and used to generate electric energy for the city of Vigo&#x27;s tram network. On 23 July 1945, the boat was taken to the United Kingdom for Operation Deadlight and was scuttled on 13 December 1945.

One other U-boat was interned in Spain during World War II: .

<text>In telephony, the local loop (also referred to as the local tail, subscriber line, or in the aggregate as the last mile) is the physical link or circuit that connects from the demarcation point of the customer premises to the edge of the common carrier or telecommunications service provider&#x27;s network.

At the edge of the carrier access network in a traditional public telephone network, the local loop terminates in a circuit switch housed in an incumbent local exchange carrier or telephone exchange.

== Infrastructure ==
Traditionally, the local loop was an electrical circuit in the form of a single pair of conductors from the telephone on the customer&#x27;s premises to the local telephone exchange. Single-wire earth return lines had been used in some countries until the introduction of electric tramways from the 1900s made them unusable.

Historically the first section was often an aerial open-wire line, with several conductors attached to porcelain insulators on cross-arms on &quot;telegraph&quot; poles. Hence party line service was often given to residential customers to minimise the number of local loops required. Usually all these circuits went into aerial or buried cables with a twisted pair for each local loop nearer the exchange, see outside plant.

Modern implementations may include a digital loop carrier system segment or fiber optic transmission system. The local loop may terminate at a circuit switch owned by a competitive local exchange carrier and housed in a point of presence (POP), which typically is an incumbent local exchange carrier telephone exchange. A local loop supports voice and/or data communications applications in the following ways:

* analog voice and signaling used in traditional POTS
* Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN)
* variants of digital subscriber line (DSL).

The term &quot;local loop&quot; is sometimes used for any &quot;last mile&quot; connection to the customer, regardless of technology or intended purpose. Local loop interrelations in this sense include:

*Electric power lines. 
*Cable connections used with television, internet and telephone.
*Wireless signals or local loop (WLL): LMDS, WiMAX, GPRS, HSDPA, DECT
*Satellite connections for beamed signal.
*Optical or fiber optics services.

<doc id="59604" wikidata="Q587129" url="?curid=59604" title="Epiphenomenon">
<text>An epiphenomenon (plural: epiphenomena) is a secondary phenomenon that occurs alongside or in parallel to a primary phenomenon. The word has two senses: one that connotes known causation and one that connotes absence of causation or reservation of judgment about it.

==Examples==
===Metaphysics===
In the philosophy of causality, an epiphenomenon is any effect of a cause apart from the effect under primary consideration. In situations in which an event of interest is caused by (or, is said to be caused by) an event , which also causes (or, is said to cause) an event , then is an epiphenomenon. The problem of epiphenomena is often a counterexample to theories of causation. For example, take a simplified Lewisian counterfactual analysis of causation that the meaning of propositions about causal relationships between two events and can be explained in terms of counterfactual conditionals of the form &quot;if had not occurred then would not have occurred&quot;. Suppose that causes and that has an epiphenomenon . We then have that if had not occurred, then would not have occurred, either. But then according to the counterfactual analysis of causation, the proposition that there is a causal dependence of on is true; that is, on this view, caused . Since this is not in line with how we ordinarily speak about causation (we would not say that caused ), a counterfactual analysis seems to be insufficient.

===Philosophy of mind and psychology===

An epiphenomenon can be an effect of primary phenomena, but cannot affect a primary phenomenon. In the philosophy of mind, epiphenomenalism is the view that mental phenomena are epiphenomena in that they can be caused by physical phenomena, but cannot cause physical phenomena. In strong epiphenomenalism, epiphenomena that are mental phenomena can &quot;only&quot; be caused by physical phenomena, not by other mental phenomena. In weak epiphenomenalism, epiphenomena that are mental phenomena can be caused by both physical phenomena and other mental phenomena, but mental phenomena cannot be the cause of any physical phenomenon. 

The physical world operates independently of the mental world in epiphenomenalism; the mental world exists as a derivative parallel world to the physical world, affected by the physical world (and by other epiphenomena in weak epiphenomenalism), but not able to have an effect on the physical world. Instrumentalist versions of epiphenomenalism allow some mental phenomena to cause physical phenomena, when those mental phenomena can be strictly analyzable as summaries of physical phenomena, preserving causality of the physical world to be strictly analyzable by other physical phenomena.

===Medicine===
In the more general use of the word, a causal relationship between the phenomena is implied; the epiphenomenon is a consequence of the primary phenomenon. This is the sense that is related to the noun &quot;epiphenomenalism&quot;.

However, in medicine, this relationship is typically &quot;not&quot; implied, and the word is usually used in its second sense: an epiphenomenon may occur independently, and is called an epiphenomenon because it is not the primary phenomenon under study or because only correlation, not causation, is known or suspected. In this sense, saying that X is associated with Y as an epiphenomenon is preserving an acknowledgment that correlation does not imply causation. Signs, symptoms, syndromes (groups of symptoms), and risk factors can all be epiphenomena in this sense. For example, having an increased risk of breast cancer concurrent with taking an antibiotic is an epiphenomenon. It is not the antibiotic that is causing the increased risk, but the increased inflammation associated with the bacterial infection that prompted the taking of an antibiotic. The metaphor of a tree is one way of helping to explain the difference to someone struggling to understand. If the infection is the root of the tree, and the inflammation is the trunk, then the cancer and the antibiotic are two branches; the antibiotic is not the trunk.

===Electromagnetism===
Although electronics is said to be due to the influence of electrons, the standard approach to the study of electrical phenomena due to James Clerk Maxwell views these particles as secondary:
=== Propositional theory ===
Zenon Pylyshyn suggested a propositional model of cognition where people do not conceptualize ideas in images but rather in meaningful relationships. In this theory, epiphenomena refer to images because they are merely products people conceptualize from their actual thought processes. Pylyshyn defends his claim by explaining that we only see images when we envision the form of an object. While visualizing objects or actions is a frequent process in our mind, it does not occur when we are considering the meaning behind an action or the non-visual properties of an object. There are many concepts we simply cannot envision. Additionally, when envisioning an image, it changes based on our preconceived notions, suggesting that semantic relations precede visual images. Unfortunately, the idea of epiphenomena in propositional theory is largely subjective and not falsifiable.

<text>Mission San Carlos Borromeo del R√≠o Carmelo (English: The Mission of Saint Charles Borromeo of the Carmel River), first built in 1797, is one of the most authentically restored Catholic mission churches in California. Located at the mouth of Carmel Valley, California, it is on the National Register of Historic Places and is a National Historic Landmark.

From 1797 until 1833, Carmel Mission was the headquarters of all Alta California missions. It was headed by Saint Jun√≠pero Serra from 1770 until his death in 1784. It was also the seat of the second missions &quot;presidente&quot;, Father Ferm√≠n Francisco de Lasu√©n, who was in charge of completing nine more mission churches.

In 1833 the mission buildings and lands were secularized by the Mexican government. By the mid-19th century, the Carmel Mission structures had fallen into disrepair. The chapel was saved from total destruction when the roof was rebuilt in 1884. In 1886, ownership of the mission was transferred from a group of Franciscans to the Diocese of Monterey. Ever since, Carmel Mission has been a parish within that diocese.

Beginning in 1931, Harry Downie began restoring the mission and worked continuously on the project for the next 50 years. It is the only Spanish mission in California that has its original bell and bell tower. Carmel Mission contains the state&#x27;s first library.

==History==
Mission Carmel ( The Carmel Mission) was the second mission built by Franciscan missionaries in Upper California. It was first established as Mission San Carlos Borromeo in Monterey, California near the native village of &quot;Tamo&quot; on June 3, 1770, by Father Jun√≠pero Serra. It was named for Carlo Borromeo, Archbishop of Milan, Italy, and was the site of the first Christian confirmation in Alta California.

===Relocation to Carmel Valley===
Pedro Fages, who served as military governor of Alta California from 1770 to 1774, kept his headquarters in the polity&#x27;s capitol, at the Presidio of Monterey. Fages worked his men very harshly and was seen as a tyrant. Serra intervened on behalf of Fages&#x27; soldiers, and the two men did not get along. Fages regarded the Spanish installations in California as military institutions first, and religious outposts second. The soldiers raped the Indian women and kept them as concubines. Serra wanted to put some distance between the mission&#x27;s and Fages&#x27; soldiers.

Serra found that the land at the mouth of Carmel Valley, where the Carmel River (named &quot;R√≠o del Carmelo&quot; by Vizca√≠no in 1603) runs into Carmel Bay, was better suited for farming. In May 1771, Spain&#x27;s viceroy approved Serra&#x27;s petition to relocate the mission. The mission was established in the new location on August 1, 1771; the first mass was celebrated on August 24, and Serra officially took up residence in the newly constructed buildings on December 24.

The name of the relocated mission was extended to &quot;Mission San Carlos Borromeo del R√≠o Carmelo&quot;. It was within a short distance of the Rumsen Ohlone villages of Tucutnut and Achasta. The latter village may have been founded after Mission San Carlos was relocated to Carmel Valley. The mission was about from the nearest Esselen territory, Excelen. The original building in Monterey continued to operate as the Royal Presidio&#x27;s chapel and later became the current Cathedral of San Carlos Borromeo.

===Serra&#x27;s headquarters===
&quot;Mission Carmel&quot;, as it came to be known, was Serra&#x27;s favorite and, because it was close to Monterey, the capital of Alta California, he chose it as his headquarters. When he died on August 28, 1784, he was interred beneath the chapel floor. After Serra&#x27;s death, Father Ferm√≠n Lasu√©n replaced the adobe structure with one built of stone quarried from the nearby Santa Lucia Mountains.

===Indian baptisms===
After the Carmel mission was moved to the mouth of Carmel Valley, the Franciscans began to baptize some natives. By the end of 1771, the population of the mission was 15 with an additional 22 baptized Indians, out of a total population of northern California of 60.

Farming was not very productive and for several years the mission was dependent upon the arrival of supply ships. Historian Jame Culleton wrote in 1950, &quot;The summer of &#x27;73 came without bringing the supply ship. Neither Carmel nor Monterey was anything like self-supporting.&quot;

To improve baptismal rates, they sought to convert key members of the Esselen and Rumsen tribes, including chiefs. On May 9, 1775, Jun√≠pero Serra baptized what appears to be the first Esselen, &quot;Pach-hepas&quot;, the 40-year-old chief of the Excelen. He was near death and was baptized in his home village at Xas√°uan, about 10 leagues (about ) southeast of the mission, in an area now named Cachagua, a close approximation of the Esselen name.

===Forced labor===
The Esselen and Ohlone Indians who lived near the mission were baptized and then forcibly relocated and conscripted as forced laborers. Over the years about 900 Esselen were baptized and brought to the 
Two missions at Carmel Valley, Soledad, and San Antonio that surrounding their native land. There was extensive &quot;comingling of the Costanoan with peoples of different linguistic and cultural background during the mission period.&quot; The neophytes were taught to be farmers, shepherds, cowboys, blacksmiths, carpenters, bricklayers, furniture makers, tanners, weavers and candle makers. Disease, starvation, overwork, and torture decimated these tribes. The number of natives who died at the missions were high. Deaths exceeded births and the population at Mission San Carlos peaked in 1795, when the population reached a total reported variously as either 876 or 927, but by 1823 the total had dwindled to 381.

===Crops and livestock===
In the beginning, the mission relied on bear meat from Mission San Antonio de Padua and supplies brought by ship from Mission San Diego de Alcal√°. In 1779, four years after the first Esselen baptism, the Native Americans at Carmel Mission harvested 1,660 bushels of wheat, 700 bushels of barley, 165 bushels of beans, and 85 bushels of maize. Four years later, the native laborers produced enough crops to support 700 people. The mission had more than 500 cattle and sheep.

Carmel Mission continued to grow during most of the 18th century. By 1800, agriculture production at Carmel Mission was near its peak. The Mission reported to Mexico that it had 2,180 horses and cattle, and 4,160 smaller livestock, including sheep. The total grain harvested was about 3,700 bushels per year with a high of 7,400 in 1797. In December 1832, the mission reported to Mexico that it had 2,100 cattle, 3,300 sheep, 410 horses, and 8 mules.

===Secularized and abandoned===
The Mexican government was concerned that the missions remained loyal to the Catholic Church in Spain. Only eight months later, in August 1833, the government secularized all of the missions and their valuable lands. The government stipulated that half the mission lands should be awarded to the native people, but this purpose was never accomplished. Most mission property was bought by government officials or their wealthy friends. The priests could not maintain the missions without the Indians&#x27; forced labor and the mission and lands were soon abandoned. The Indians were forced from the mission by the new landowners. Some attempted to return to their native ways, and others found work as ranch hands or servants on farms and ranches.

By 1850, the mission was nearly a ruin. The stone chapel building was deteriorating while most of the adobe buildings were eroding away. The roof collapsed in 1852.

===Restoration===


When Mexico ceded California to the United States following the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored, but required that the owners provide legal proof of their title. As required by the Land Act of 1851, Archbishop Joseph Sadoc Alemany filed a claim on February 19, 1853, on behalf of the Roman Catholic Church. He sought return of all former mission lands in the State. The state agreed to return the original mission buildings, cemeteries, and gardens to the church.

When the Roman Catholic Church gained full control of the buildings on October 19, 1859, the mission was in ruins. In 1884 Father Angel Casanova was able to gather enough private funds to replace the roof on the chapel sufficient to preserve it until the 1930s. In 1931 Monsignor Philip Scher hired master cabinet maker Henry John (&quot;Harry&quot;) Downie who had an excellent reputation for restoring Spanish antiques. Scher initially asked Downie to restore some statues at the Carmel Mission but his job quickly expanded and he was put in charge of restoring the entire mission. Two years later, the church transferred the mission from the Franciscans to the local diocese and it became a regular parish church. Downie lived nearby in Carmel and worked almost daily for nearly 50 years to restore the mission, ancillary buildings, walls, and grounds. He painstakingly researched the church&#x27;s architecture and site, often relying on original Spanish sources, and gathered genuine artifacts from across California.

He first restored the padres&#x27; quarters, then the roof of the chapel in 1936, and over the next five years the interior of the basilica. In 1941, he oversaw restoration of the former soldiers&#x27; quarters on the east side of the quadrangle. In 1943 he began restoration of a building that had been on the south side of the quadrangle, although nothing was left but the eroded adobe foundation and a few ruined walls. The building was originally a segregated, locked dormitory for girls called the monjero (nunnery). They were separated from their families at age 8. The boys and unmarried men also had their own dormitory, though it was less confining.

The building was reconstructed and made into classrooms for Junipero Serra Elementary School. In 1946, the ruin on the east side of the quadrangle that had been the original padre&#x27;s kitchen and a blacksmith shop was rebuilt. It is used today as a chapel. Downie also consulted on the restoration of the missions that are considered the most authentic, including San Luis Obispo, San Juan Bautista, and San Buenaventura. He also helped the Native Daughters of the Golden West to reconstruct Mission Soledad. He was knighted by Pope Pius and by King Juan Carlos of Spain.

In 1960, the mission was designated as a minor basilica by Pope John XXIII. In 1987, Pope John Paul II visited the mission as part of his U.S. tour.

The original bell nicknamed Ave Maria was made in Mexico City in 1807. It was placed at the Mission in 1820. When the mission was secularized in 1834, the bell was removed and held onto by local Native Americans for safekeeping. It was finally lost, but relocated once again, during restoration. It was re-installed in the mission bell tower in 1925.

As a result of Downie&#x27;s dedicated efforts to restore the buildings, the Carmel mission church is one of the most authentically restored of all the mission churches in California. Mission Carmel has been designated a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service. It is an active parish church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Monterey.

In addition to its activity as a place of worship, Mission Carmel also hosts concerts, art exhibits, lectures, and numerous other community events. In 1986, then-pastor Monsignor Eamon MacMahon acquired a Casavant Fr√®res organ with horizontal trumpets. Its hand-painted casework is decorated with elaborate carvings and statuary reflecting the Spanish decorative style seen on the main altar.

The mission also serves as a museum, preserving its own history and the history of the area. There are four specific museum galleries: the Harry Downie Museum, describing restoration efforts; the Munras Family Heritage Museum, describing the history of one of the most important area families; the Jo Mora Chapel Gallery, hosting rotating art exhibits as well as the monumental bronze and travertine cenotaph (1924) sculpted by Jo Mora; and the Convento Museum, which holds the cell Serra lived and died in, as well as interpretive exhibits. At one end of the museum is a special chapel room containing some of the vestments used by Serra.

The mission grounds were also the location of the Jun√≠pero Serra School, a private Catholic school for kindergarteners through 8th grade operated by the Diocese of Monterey. The school opened in 1943 and closed at the end of the 2019‚Äì2020 school year.

===Modern restoration===
Between 2000 and 2007, private funding provided funds to hire Fine Art Conservation Laboratories to conserve the major original Spanish Colonial oil paintings in the nave. The company had previously been responsible for the preservation and restoration of Spanish colonial art from the Mission Inn, Riverside, California, the Santa Barbara Mission, The Institute of Iberian Art in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and from the Permanent Art Collection of Brigham Young University. The most important artwork conserved during their initial work was the &quot;Deposition&quot;, a painting commissioned by Father Serra prior to his death. It now hangs in the vicinity of his tomb in the apse of the Carmel Mission.

In 2008, the non-profit Friends of Historic Carmel Mission was formed, independent of the Diocese of Monterey. The organization&#x27;s goal was to assist the parish and diocese in restoring and preserving the historic landmark. After restoring nine mission bells and many artifacts, the Foundation became the sole funder for the restoration and changed its name to the Carmel Mission Foundation.

In 2012, the foundation began a $6.2 million capital project to restore the Basilica which had not been touched since 1937 and had been deemed unsafe by the California State Unreinforced Masonry Act. The project was the third major reconstruction of the Basilica since it was built in 1797. The contractors installed additional wood and steel beams to reinforce and tie the roof structure together. To strengthen the walls, they drilled over 300 center-cored vertical and horizontal holes in the thick walls, into which they inserted steel rods that were grouted in place. The bell tower dome was reinforced, cleaned and resurfaced.

The project also updated the electrical system and added a fire suppression system. The interior lighting was replaced, and custom-made chandeliers were added. Foundation issues were remedied and all tile was matched and restored. The project upgraded the radiant heating system and included construction of an Americans with Disabilities Act-compliant restroom. The Basilica restoration was completed in 2013. Over the next few years, the foundation funded restoration of many artifacts in the museum and to preserve historic structures from further decay. This included the Muchado House built in 1883.

In 2016, the Foundation funded the restoration of the central courtyard at a cost of $2.2 million. The unsafe, cracked concrete surface was removed and new water and fire lines, drains, sewer, electrical, and communications lines were installed before a more durable concrete surface was poured to match that of the original aggregate poured in the late 1960s.

The courtyard fountain was restored. The large Santa Maria style barbecue pits that have been used for community barbecues since 1913 were reinforced and upgraded. The gardens were replanted with native plants and outdoor lighting and electrical was installed. The foundation also created the Serra Memorial Circle in the Courtyard to honor donors.

The foundation worked with the Mission Docent Association to conserve the Our Lady of Bethlehem statue, believed to be one of the oldest statues in California. In 2020, the front perimeter wall deteriorated. The foundation paid for emergency removal of the long perimeter wall and construction of a temporary wall until a permanent one can be designed and built.

In late 2020, The Carmel Mission Foundation began a $4 million project to restore and seismically strengthen the century old Downie Museum in time to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the founding of Carmel Mission. The restoration removed restrooms from the rear of the building, doubling the museum&#x27;s interior space. Paint covering the stone installed in 1920 surrounding the fireplace was removed.

The foundation is seeking additional funding to pay for seismic retrofits, infrastructure improvements, and restoration of the Mora Museum, Convento Museum, Blessed Sacrament Chapel, and the historic Orchard House Property.

== Folklore == 
The Lost Padre Mines of the Carmel Mission have woven themselves into the tapestry of local folklore, with their legacy recounted through various accounts, including those within Randall Reinstadt&#x27;s notable works such as &quot;Ghosts, Bandits, and Legends of Old Monterey, Carmel and Surrounding Areas&quot; and &quot;Tales and Treasures of California Missions.&quot; These narratives unveil a captivating history, suggesting that indigenous communities held knowledge of abundant gold deposits concealed within the untamed terrain of the Santa Lucia Mountains. As whispers of these riches echoed through time, the enigmatic Lost Padre Mines became a testament to the allure of hidden treasures and the enduring mystique of the land. Numerous iterations of these legends appear to have originated from long-time residents of Carmel Valley. It is plausible that this phenomenon can be attributed to some of the final descendants of the Mission Indians who resided and labored in the area.

===Vandalism===
On September 27, 2015, in response to Serra&#x27;s canonization, the San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo Mission was vandalized. The statue of Serra was toppled and splattered with paint, and the cemetery, the mission doors, a fountain, and a crucifix were as well. The message &quot;Saint of Genocide&quot; was painted on the ground, and similar messages were painted elsewhere in the mission courtyard.

==Notable interments==

<doc id="59606" wikidata="Q753108" url="?curid=59606" title="Subluxation">
<text>A subluxation is an incomplete or partial dislocation of a joint or organ. According to the World Health Organization, a subluxation is a &quot;significant structural displacement&quot; and is therefore visible on static imaging studies, such as X-rays. Unlike real subluxations, the pseudoscientific concept of a chiropractic &quot;vertebral subluxation&quot; may or may not be visible on x-rays.

The term is used in the fields of medicine, dentistry, and chiropractic. There is no scientific evidence for the existence of chiropractic subluxations or proof they or their treatment have any effects on health.

== Medical ==
=== Joints ===
A subluxation of a joint is where a connecting bone is partially out of the joint. In contrast to a luxation, which is a complete separation of the joint, a subluxation often returns to its normal position without additional help from a health professional. An example of a joint subluxation is a nursemaid&#x27;s elbow, which is the subluxation of the head of the radius from the annular ligament. Other joints that are prone to subluxations are the shoulders, fingers, kneecaps, ribs, wrists, ankles, and hips affected by hip dysplasia. A spinal subluxation is visible on X-rays and can sometimes impinge on spinal nerve roots, causing symptoms in the areas served by those roots. In the spine, such a displacement may be caused by a fracture, spondylolisthesis, rheumatoid arthritis, severe osteoarthritis, falls, accidents and other traumas.

=== Ophthalmology ===

A subluxation of the lens within the eye is called ectopia lentis, wherein it is displaced or malpositioned. Subluxated lenses are frequently found in those who have had ocular trauma and those with certain systemic disorders, such as Marfan syndrome, Ehlers‚ÄìDanlos syndrome, Loeys‚ÄìDietz syndrome and homocystinuria. Some subluxated lenses may require removal, as in the case of those that float freely or those that have opacified to form cataracts.

== Dental ==
A subluxation of a tooth is a dental traumatic injury in which the tooth has increased mobility but has not been displaced from the mandible or maxilla. This is a common condition and one of the most common dental traumatic disorders. Dental subluxation is a non-dental-urgency condition, i.e., unlikely to result in significant morbidity if not seen within 24 hours by a dentist, and usually treated conservatively: good oral hygiene with 0.12% chlorhexidine gluconate mouthwash, a soft and cold diet, and avoidance of smoking for several days. In painful situations, a temporary splinting of the injured tooth may relieve the pain.

Subluxation may also occur in the mandible from the articular groove of the temporal bone. The mandible can dislocate in the anterior, posterior, lateral, or superior position. Description of the dislocation is based on the location of the condyle in comparison to the temporal articular groove.

== Chiropractic ==

Unlike real subluxations, the pseudoscientific concept of a chiropractic &quot;vertebral subluxation&quot; may or may not be visible on x-rays. Nor may it involve a significant displacement or even pain or clear dysfunction. Straight chiropractors claim that vertebral subluxation has considerable health effects and also add a visceral component to the definition. Mainstream medicine and some mixer chiropractors consider these ideas to be pseudoscientific and dispute these claims, as there is no scientific evidence for the existence of chiropractic subluxations or proof they or their treatment have any effects on health.

<text>German submarine &quot;U-573&quot; was a Type VIIC U-boat built for Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; for service during World War II.

Her keel was laid down 8 June 1940 at the Blohm &amp; Voss yard in Hamburg as yard number 549. She was launched on 17 April 1941 and commissioned on 5 June with &quot;Kapit√§nleutnant&quot; Heinrich Heinsohn (12 February 1910 ‚Äì 6 May 1943) in command. Heinsohn commanded her for her entire career in the Kriegsmarine. In May 1941 he had arranged that the city of Landeck in Tyrol adopted the submarine within the then popular sponsorship programme (Patenschaftsprogramm), organising gifts and holidays for the crew, earning her the honorary name &quot;U-573 &quot;Landeck&quot;&quot;.

The boat began her service career as part of the 3rd U-boat Flotilla when she conducted training; on 1 September 1941 she commenced operations with that flotilla. She was transferred to the 29th Flotilla, also for operations, on 1 January 1942. She was sold to the Spanish Navy that same year and became the Spanish submarine &quot;G-7&quot;.

==Design==
German Type VIIC submarines were preceded by the shorter Type VIIB submarines. &quot;U-573&quot; had a displacement of when at the surface and while submerged. She had a total length of , a pressure hull length of , a beam of , a height of , and a draught of . The submarine was powered by two Germaniawerft F46 four-stroke, six-cylinder supercharged diesel engines producing a total of for use while surfaced, two Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie GG UB 720/8 double-acting electric motors producing a total of for use while submerged. She had two shafts and two propellers. The boat was capable of operating at depths of up to .

The submarine had a maximum surface speed of and a maximum submerged speed of . When submerged, the boat could operate for at ; when surfaced, she could travel at . &quot;U-573&quot; was fitted with five torpedo tubes (four fitted at the bow and one at the stern), fourteen torpedoes, one SK C/35 naval gun, 220 rounds, and a C/30 anti-aircraft gun. The boat had a complement of between forty-four and sixty.

==German service==
&quot;U-573&quot; conducted four war patrols, sinking just one ship.

===First, second and third patrols===
Her operational career began with her departure from Kiel on 15 September 1941. She entered the Atlantic via the North Sea and the gap between Iceland and the Faroe Islands. She almost reached the Labrador coast before heading for St. Nazaire in occupied France, docking on 15 November.

&quot;U-573&quot;‚Ä≥s second patrol involved the boat slipping past the heavily defended Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean, where she sank the Norwegian &quot;Hellen&quot; (5,289 GRT) with two torpedoes on 21 December 1941. She arrived at Pola in Croatia on 30 December.

Her third sortie was relatively uneventful, starting and finishing in Pola between 2 February and 6 March 1942.

===Fourth patrol and internment===
On 29 April 1942, &quot;U-573&quot; was attacked with depth charges by Lockheed Hudsons of No. 233 Squadron RAF, northwest of Algiers. Seriously damaged, she limped north to Spain, arriving in Cartagena on 2 May. International agreements allowed ships in neutral ports 24 hours to make emergency repairs before they were to be interned. The Spanish authorities granted &quot;U-573&quot; a three-month period for repairs, which prompted several strong protests from the British Embassy in Madrid. On 19 May Heinsohn flew from Madrid to Stuttgart, then travelled on to Berlin, in order to discuss the situation with the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. He returned by train via Hendaye (in southwest France) on 28 May. Realizing that even three months would not be enough to repair the boat, the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; sold the vessel to Spain for . On 2 August 1942, at 10¬†am, (one day before the three-month period was due to expire), the Spanish navy commissioned the boat as the &quot;G-7&quot;.

&quot;U-573&quot;‚Ä≥s crew suffered no casualties during her career in the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. The men had been interned in Cartagena and were gradually released in groups of two or three. The last five members of the crew left with &quot;Kapit√§nleutnant&quot; Heinsohn on 13 February 1943. He returned to the &quot;Kriegsmarinearsenal&quot; in Gotenhafen (Gdynia, Poland), then German-annexed Poland, In March he was ordered to Brest, then in German-occupied France to take command of , and died with all his crew two months later.

==Spanish service==
Work started on the &quot;U-573&quot;, now the &quot;G-7&quot;, in August 1943 following the sale to Spain but took four years to complete. The damage caused by the British attack was found to be more extensive than was first thought; also German technical assistance and parts were difficult to obtain in the last years of World War II and after. In addition, Spain&#x27;s economy was weak following the Spanish Civil War. Repairs were completed in early 1947 and on 5 November 1947 &quot;G-7&quot; was re-commissioned. The bow&#x27;s net cutter and the 20mm anti aircraft cannon were removed.

Despite the Type VII being out-dated by the end of World War II, &quot;G-7&quot; was the most modern of Spain&#x27;s submarine fleet; her other vessels (two ex-Italian, and four home-built boats) dating from the early 1930s. &quot;G-7&quot; lacked radar and did not possess a snorkel. In 1951 development was started on a snorkel design by Empresa Nacional Baz√°n, the Spanish shipbuilding company, but these came to nothing when the Spanish Navy bought the former US Navy submarine .

&quot;G-7&quot;‚Ä≥s repairs were completed in 1947. In 1958 Arca-Filmproduktion GmbH rented &quot;G-7&quot; to take part in the semi-fictitious movie &quot;U 47 ‚Äì Kapit√§nleutnant Prien&quot;, partially based on his patrol to Scapa Flow, where he sank .

In 1961 the Spanish Navy&#x27;s submarine force was re-numbered, and &quot;G-7&quot; became &quot;S-01&quot;.

One other U-boat was interned in Spain during World War II: .

On 2 May 1970 she was de-commissioned after 23 years service. She was auctioned for 3,334,751 Pts (about US$26,500), after which, despite efforts to save and preserve her as a museum, the submarine was broken up for scrap.

<text>Atlantic Recording Corporation (simply known as Atlantic Records) is an American record label founded in October 1947 by Ahmet Ertegun and Herb Abramson. Over the course of its first two decades, starting from the release of its first recordings in January 1948, Atlantic earned a reputation as one of the most important American labels, specializing in jazz, R&amp;B, and soul by Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett, Sam and Dave, Ruth Brown and Otis Redding. Its position was greatly improved by its distribution deal with Stax. In 1967, Atlantic became a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, now the Warner Music Group, and expanded into rock and pop music with releases by Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, Led Zeppelin, and Yes.

In 2004, Atlantic and its sister label Elektra were merged into the Atlantic Records Group. Craig Kallman is the chairman of Atlantic. Ahmet Ertegun served as founding chairman until his death on December 14, 2006, at age 83.

==History==
===Founding and early history===
In 1944, when their mother and sister returned to Turkey after the death of their father Munir Ertegun, Turkey&#x27;s first ambassador to the U.S., brothers Nesuhi and Ahmet Ertegun remained in the United States. The brothers were fans of jazz and rhythm &amp; blues, amassing a collection of over 15,000 78 RPM records. Ahmet stayed in Washington to undertake post-graduate music studies at Georgetown University, and immersed himself in the Washington music scene. He entered the record business, which was enjoying a resurgence after wartime restrictions on the shellac used in manufacture had been lifted. He convinced the family dentist, Vahdi Sabit, to invest $10,000 and hired Herb Abramson, a dentistry student.

Herb had worked as a part-time A&amp;R manager/producer for Al Green at the jazz label National Records, signing Big Joe Turner and Billy Eckstine. He founded Jubilee in 1946 but had no interest in its most successful musicians. In September 1947, he sold his share in Jubilee to his partner, Jerry Blaine, and invested $2,500 in Atlantic.

Atlantic was incorporated in October 1947 and was run by Herb (president) and Ertegun (vice-president in charge of A&amp;R, production, and promotion). Herb&#x27;s wife Miriam Abramson ran the label&#x27;s publishing company, Progressive Music. She did most office duties until 1949, when Atlantic hired its first employee, bookkeeper Francine Wakschal, who remained with the label for the next 49 years. Miriam gained a reputation for toughness. Staff engineer Tom Dowd recalled, &quot;Tokyo Rose was the kindest name some people had for her&quot; and Doc Pomus described her as &quot;an extraordinarily vitriolic woman&quot;. When interviewed in 2009, she attributed her reputation to the company&#x27;s chronic cash-flow shortage: &quot;... most of the problems we had with artists were that they wanted advances, and that was very difficult for us ... we were undercapitalized for a long time.&quot; The label&#x27;s office in the Ritz Hotel in Manhattan proved too expensive, so they moved to a room in the Hotel Jefferson. In the early fifties, Atlantic moved from the Hotel Jefferson to offices at 301 West 54th St and then to 356 West 56th St.

Atlantic&#x27;s first recordings were issued in late January 1948 and included &quot;That Old Black Magic&quot; by Tiny Grimes and &quot;The Spider&quot; by Joe Morris. In its early years, Atlantic concentrated on modern jazz, although it released some country and western and spoken word recordings. Herb also produced &quot;Magic Records&quot;, children&#x27;s records with four grooves on each side. Each groove contained a different story, so the story played would be determined by the groove in which the stylus happened to land.

In late 1947, James Petrillo, head of the American Federation of Musicians, announced an indefinite ban on all recording activities by union musicians. This came into effect on January 1, 1948. The union action forced Atlantic to use almost all its capital to cut and stockpile enough recordings to last through the ban, which was expected to continue for at least a year.

Ertegun and Herb spent much of the late 1940s and early 1950s scouring nightclubs in search of talent. Ertegun composed songs under the alias &quot;A. Nugetre&quot;, including Big Joe Turner&#x27;s hit &quot;Chains of Love&quot;, recording them in booths in Times Square, then giving them to an arranger or session musician. Early releases included music by Sidney Bechet, Barney Bigard, The Cardinals, The Clovers, Frank Culley, The Delta Rhythm Boys, Erroll Garner, Dizzy Gillespie, Tiny Grimes, Al Hibbler, Earl Hines, Johnny Hodges, Jackie &amp; Roy, Lead Belly, Meade Lux Lewis, Professor Longhair, Shelly Manne, Howard McGhee, Mabel Mercer, James Moody, Joe Morris, Art Pepper, Django Reinhardt, Pete Rugolo, Pee Wee Russell, Bobby Short, Sylvia Syms, Billy Taylor, Sonny Terry, Big Joe Turner, Jimmy Yancey, Sarah Vaughan, Mal Waldron, and Mary Lou Williams.

===First hits===
In early 1949, a New Orleans distributor phoned Ertegun to obtain Stick McGhee&#x27;s &quot;Drinking Wine, Spo-Dee-O-Dee&quot;, which was unavailable due to the closing of McGhee&#x27;s previous label, Harlem Records. Ertegun knew Stick&#x27;s younger brother Brownie McGhee, with whom Stick happened to be staying, so he contacted the McGhee brothers and re-recorded the song. When released in February 1949, it became Atlantic&#x27;s first hit, selling 400,000 copies, and reached No. 2 after spending almost six months on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart ‚Äì although McGhee himself earned just $10 for the session. Atlantic recorded 187 songs in 1949, more than three times the amount from the previous two years, and received overtures for a manufacturing and distribution deal with Columbia, which would pay Atlantic a 3% royalty on every copy sold. Ertegun asked about artists&#x27; royalties, which he paid. This surprised Columbia executives, who did not, and the deal was scuttled.

On the recommendation of broadcaster Willis Conover, Ertegun and Herb visited Ruth Brown at the Crystal Caverns club in Washington and invited her to audition for Atlantic. She was injured in a car accident en route to New York City, but Atlantic supported her for nine months and then signed her. &quot;So Long&quot;, her first record for the label, was recorded with Eddie Condon&#x27;s band on May 25, 1949. The song reached No. 6 on the R&amp;B chart. Brown recorded more than eighty songs for Atlantic, becoming its bestselling, most prolific musician of the period. Brown&#x27;s success was so significant to Atlantic that the label became known colloquially as &quot;The House That Ruth Built&quot;.

Joe Morris, one of the label&#x27;s earliest signings, scored a hit with his October 1950 song &quot;Anytime, Anyplace, Anywhere&quot;. It was the first Atlantic record issued in 45rpm format, which the company began pressing in January 1951. The Clovers&#x27; &quot;Don&#x27;t You Know I Love You&quot; (composed by Ertegun) became the label&#x27;s first R&amp;B No. 1 in September 1951. A few weeks later, Brown&#x27;s &quot;Teardrops from My Eyes&quot; became its first million-selling record. She hit No. 1 again in March‚ÄìApril 1952 with &quot;5-10-15 Hours&quot;. &quot;Daddy Daddy&quot; reached No. 3 in September 1952, and &quot;Mama, He Treats Your Daughter Mean&quot; with Connie Kay on drums reached No. 1 in February and March 1953. After Brown left the label in 1961, her career declined, and she worked as a cleaner and bus driver to support her children. In the 1980s she sued Atlantic for unpaid royalties; although Atlantic, which prided itself on treating artists fairly, had stopped paying royalties to some musicians. Ertegun denied this was intentional. Brown received a voluntary payment of $20,000 and founded the Rhythm and Blues Foundation in 1988 with a donation of $1.5 million from Ertegun.

In 1952 Atlantic signed Ray Charles, whose hits included &quot;I Got a Woman&quot;, &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot;, and &quot;Hallelujah I Love Her So&quot;. Later that year The Clovers&#x27; &quot;One Mint Julep&quot; reached No. 2. In 1953, after learning that singer Clyde McPhatter had been fired from Billy Ward and His Dominoes and was forming The Drifters, Ertegun signed the group. Their single &quot;Money Honey&quot; became the biggest R&amp;B hit of the year. Their records created some controversy: the suggestive &quot;Such A Night&quot; was banned by radio station WXYZ in Detroit, Michigan, and &quot;Honey Love&quot; was banned in Memphis, Tennessee but both reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart.

===Tom Dowd===
Recording engineer and producer Tom Dowd played a crucial role in Atlantic&#x27;s success. He initially worked for Atlantic on a freelance basis, but within a few years he had been hired as the label&#x27;s full-time staff engineer. His recordings for Atlantic and Stax influenced pop music.

Atlantic was one of the first independent labels to make recordings in stereo: Dowd used a portable stereo recorder which ran simultaneously with the studio&#x27;s existing mono recorder. In 1953 (according to &quot;Billboard&quot;) Atlantic was the first label to issue commercial LPs recorded in the experimental stereo system called binaural recording. In this system, recordings were made using two microphones, spaced at approximately the distance between the human ears. Thd left and right channels were recorded as two separate, parallel grooves. Playing them back required a turntable with a special tone-arm fitted with dual needles; it was not until around 1958 that the single stylus microgroove system (in which the two stereo channels were cut into either side of a single groove) became the industry standard. By the late 1950s stereo LPs and turntables were being introduced. Atlantic&#x27;s early stereo recordings included &quot;Lover&#x27;s Question&quot; by Clyde McPhatter, &quot;What Am I Living For&quot; by Chuck Willis, &quot;I Cried a Tear&quot; by LaVern Baker, &quot;Splish Splash&quot; by Bobby Darin, &quot;Yakety Yak&quot; by the Coasters and &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot; by Ray Charles. Although these were primarily 45rpm mono singles for much of the 1950s, Dowd stockpiled his &quot;parallel&quot; stereo takes for future release. In 1968 the label issued &quot;History of Rhythm and Blues, Volume 4&quot; in stereo. Stereo versions of Ray Charles &quot;What&#x27;d I Say&quot; and &quot;Night Time is the Right Time&quot; were included on the Atlantic anthology &quot;The Birth of Soul: The Complete Atlantic Rhythm &amp; Blues Recordings, 1952‚Äì1959&quot;.

Atlantic&#x27;s New York studio was the first in America to install multitrack recording machines, developed by the Ampex company. Bobby Darin&#x27;s &quot;Splish, Splash&quot; was the first song to be recorded on an 8-track recorder. It was not until the mid-1960s that multitrack recorders became the norm in English studios and EMI&#x27;s Abbey Road Studios did not install 8-track facilities until 1968.

Atlantic entered the LP market early: its first was &quot;This Is My Beloved&quot; (March 1949), a 10&quot; album of poetry by Walter Benton that was narrated by John Dall with music by Vernon Duke. In 1951, Atlantic was one of the first independent labels to press records in the 45rpm single format. By 1956 the 45 had surpassed the 78 in sales for singles. In April of that year, Miriam (Abramson) Bienstock reported to &quot;Billboard&quot; that Atlantic was selling 75% of its singles as 45s. During the previous year, 78s had outsold 45s by a ratio of two to one.

===Jerry Wexler===
In February 1953, Herb Abramson was drafted into the U.S. Army. He moved to Germany, where he served in the Army Dental Corps, although he retained his post as president of Atlantic on full pay. Ertegun hired &quot;Billboard&quot; reporter Jerry Wexler in June 1953. Wexler is credited with coining the term &quot;rhythm &amp; blues&quot; to replace &quot;race music&quot;. He was appointed vice-president and purchased 13% of the company&#x27;s stock. Wexler and Ertegun formed a close partnership which, in collaboration with Tom Dowd, produced thirty R&amp;B hits.

Wexler&#x27;s success for Atlantic was the result of going outside jazz to sign acts who combined jazz, blues, and rhythm and blues, such as Ray Charles, Joe Turner, and Aretha Franklin. Ertegun and Wexler realized many R&amp;B recordings by black musicians were being covered by white performers, often with greater chart success. LaVern Baker had a No. 4 R&amp;B hit with &quot;Tweedlee Dee&quot;, but a rival version by Georgia Gibbs went to No. 2 on the pop chart. Big Joe Turner&#x27;s April 1954 song &quot;Shake, Rattle and Roll&quot; was a No. 1 R&amp;B hit, but it only reached No. 22 on the pop chart. Bill Haley &amp; His Comets&#x27;s version reached No. 7, selling over one million copies and becoming the bestselling song of the year for Decca. In July 1954, Wexler and Ertegun wrote a prescient article for &quot;Cash Box&quot; devoted to what they called &quot;cat music&quot;; the same month, Atlantic had its first major &quot;crossover&quot; hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; pop chart when the &quot;Sh-Boom&quot; by The Chords reached No. 5 (although The Crew-Cuts&#x27; version went to No. 1). Atlantic missed an important signing in 1955 when Sun owner Sam Phillips sold Elvis Presley&#x27;s recording contract in a bidding war between labels. Atlantic offered $25,000 which, Ertegun later noted, &quot;was all the money we had then.&quot; But they were outbid by RCA&#x27;s offer of $45,000. In 1990 Ertegun remarked, &quot;The president of RCA at the time had been extensively quoted in &quot;Variety&quot; damning R&amp;B music as immoral. He soon stopped when RCA signed Elvis Presley.&quot;

===Nesuhi Ertegun===

Ahmet&#x27;s older brother Nesuhi was hired in January 1955. He had been living in Los Angeles for several years and had intermittent contact with his younger brother. But when Ahmet learned that Nesuhi had been offered a partnership in Atlantic&#x27;s rival Imperial Records, he and Wexler convinced Nesuhi to join Atlantic instead. Nesuhi became head of artists and repertoire (A&amp;R), led the label&#x27;s jazz division, and built a roster that included Shorty Rogers, Jimmy Giuffre, Herbie Mann, Les McCann, Charles Mingus, and John Coltrane. By 1958 Atlantic was America&#x27;s second-largest independent jazz label.

Nesuhi was also in charge of LP production. He was credited with improving the production, packaging, and originality of Atlantic&#x27;s LPs. He deleted the old &#x27;100&#x27; and &#x27;400&#x27; series of 10&quot; albums and the earlier 12&quot; albums in Atlantic&#x27;s catalog, starting the &#x27;1200&#x27; series, which sold for $4.98, with Shorty Rogers&#x27; &quot;The Swingin&#x27; Mr Rogers&quot;. In 1956 he started the &#x27;8000&#x27; popular series (selling for $3.98) for the label&#x27;s few R&amp;B albums, reserving the 1200 series for jazz. Joel Dorn became Nesuhi&#x27;s assistant after his successful production of Hubert Laws&#x27; album &quot;The Laws of Jazz&quot;.

===Herb Abramson departs===
When Herb returned from military service in 1955, he realized that he had been replaced by Wexler as Ahmet&#x27;s partner. Herb did not get along with either Wexler or Nesuhi Ertegun, and he had returned from military service with a German girlfriend, which precipitated his divorce from Miriam, a minor stockholder and Atlantic&#x27;s business and publishing manager.

By 1958, relations between Herb and his partners had broken down. In December 1958 a $300,000 buy-out was arranged. His stock was split between Nesuhi Ertegun and Herb&#x27;s ex-wife Miriam, who had in the meantime remarried to music publisher Freddy Bienstock (later the owner of the Carlin Music / Chappell Music publishing empire). Herb&#x27;s departure opened the way for Ahmet Ertegun to take over as president of the label. The roles of the other executives with Herb&#x27;s departure were Wexler as executive vice-president and general manager, Nesuhi Ertegun as executive vice-president in charge of the LP department and Miriam Bienstock as vice-president and also president of Atlantic&#x27;s music publishing arm Progressive Music. Wexler was also executive vice-president of Progressive, and the Ertegun brothers were vice-presidents.

===Expansion===
Atlantic played a major role in popularizing the genre that Jerry Wexler dubbed rhythm &amp; blues, and it profited handsomely. The market for these records exploded during late 1953 and early 1954 as R&amp;B hits crossed over to the mainstream (i.e. white) audience. In its tenth anniversary feature on Atlantic, &quot;Billboard&quot; noted, &quot;... a very big R&amp;B record might achieve 250,000 sales, but from this point on (1953‚Äì54), the industry began to see million sellers, one after the other, in the R&amp;B field&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; said Atlantic&#x27;s &quot;fresh sound&quot; and the quality of its recordings, arrangements, and musicians was a great advance from standard R&amp;B records. For five years Atlantic &quot;dominated the rhythm and blues chart with its roster of powerhouse artists&quot;.

Beginning in 1954, Atlantic created or acquired several subsidiary labels, the first being Cat Records. By the mid-1950s, Atlantic had an informal agreement with the French label Barclay, and the two companies regularly exchanged titles, usually jazz recordings. Atlantic also began to get recordings distributed in the United Kingdom, first through EMI on a &#x27;one-off&#x27; basis. But in September 1955 Miriam Abramson traveled to the UK and signed a distribution deal with Decca. Miriam recalled, &quot;I would deal with people there who were not really comfortable with women in business, so...we would do business very quickly and get it over with.&quot;

A subsidiary label, Atco, was established in 1955 to keep Herb involved. After a slow start, Atco had considerable success with Bobby Darin. His early releases were unsuccessful, and Herb planned to drop him. But when Ertegun offered him another chance, the result was &quot;Splish Splash&quot;, which Darin had written in 12 minutes. The song sold 100,000 copies in the first month and became a million-seller. &quot;Queen of the Hop&quot; made the Top 10 on both the US pop and R&amp;B charts and charted in the UK. &quot;Dream Lover&quot; reached No. 2 in the US and No. 1 in the UK and became a multi-million seller. &quot;Mack the Knife&quot; (1959) went to No. 1 in both the US and the UK, sold over 2 million copies, and won the 1960 Grammy Award for Record of the Year. &quot;Beyond the Sea&quot; became Darin&#x27;s fourth consecutive Top 10 hit in the US and UK. He signed with Capitol and moved for Hollywood to attempt a movie career, but hits such as &quot;You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby&quot; and &quot;Things&quot; continued to benefit Atco through 1962. Darin returned to Atlantic in 1965. In 1965, Atlantic formed a budget label called Clarion Records. 21 albums were released simultaneously in 1965, all of them shown on the back cover of their releases. No further albums were issued as the label lasted less than a year.

===Leiber and Stoller===
Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller wrote &quot;Smokey Joe&#x27;s Cafe&quot;, which became a hit for The Robins. Their label Spark was bought by Atlantic, and they were hired as America&#x27;s first independent record producers, free to produce for other labels. Two members of The Robins formed The Coasters and recorded hits for Atlantic, such as &quot;Down in Mexico&quot; and &quot;Young Blood&quot;. &quot;Yakety Yak&quot; became Atlantic&#x27;s first No. 1 pop hit. Leiber and Stoller also wrote the hit &quot;Ruby Baby&quot; for The Drifters.

Record producer Phil Spector moved to New York to work with Leiber and Stoller. He learned his trade at Trey Records, a label in California owned by Lester Sill and Lee Hazlewood and distributed by Atlantic. Sill recommended Spector to Leiber and Stoller, who assigned him to produce &quot;Corrine, Corrina&quot; by Ray Peterson and &quot;Pretty Little Angel Eyes&quot; by Curtis Lee. Both became hits, and Atlantic hired him as a staff producer. Ahmet Ertegun liked him, but Leiber said, &quot;He wasn&#x27;t likable. He was funny, he was amusing‚Äîbut he wasn&#x27;t nice.&quot; Wexler disliked him. Miriam Bienstock called him &quot;a pain in the neck&quot;. When Spector criticized Bobby Darin&#x27;s songwriting, Darin had him thrown out of the house.

Atlantic tolerated Spector, but with diminishing returns. He produced &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; for The Top Notes, and it flopped. Songwriter Bert Berns hated Spector&#x27;s arrangement and thought it ruined the song, so Berns re-recorded it with The Isley Brothers and it became a hit. During his short time at Atlantic, Spector produced music for LaVern Baker, Ruth Brown, Jean DuShon, and Billy Storm. In 1961, he left the label, returned to Los Angeles, and founded Philles Records with Lester Sill. Spector became one of the most successful record producers of the 1960s.

Although Leiber and Stoller wrote many popular songs for Atlantic, their relationship with the label was deteriorating in 1962. The breaking point came when they asked for a producer&#x27;s royalty. It was granted informally, but their accountant insisted on a written contract and an audit of Atlantic&#x27;s accounts. The audit revealed Leiber and Stoller had been underpaid by $18,000. Although Leiber considered dropping the matter, Stoller pressed Atlantic for payment. Wexler replied that the payment would mean the end of their relationship with the label. Leiber and Stoller backed down, but the relationship ended anyway. Their assignment to work on The Drifter&#x27;s next recording was given to Phil Spector.

Leiber and Stoller worked briefly for United Artists, then started Red Bird with George Goldner. They had hits with &quot;Chapel of Love&quot; by The Dixie Cups and &quot;Leader of the Pack&quot; by The Shangri-Las, but Red Bird&#x27;s finances were precarious. In 1964 they approached Jerry Wexler and proposed a merger with Atlantic. When interviewed in 1990 for Ertegun&#x27;s biography, Wexler declined to discuss the matter, but Ertegun claimed these negotiations were a plan to buy him out. In September 1964, the Ertegun brothers and Wexler were in the process of buying out the company&#x27;s other two shareholders, Sabit and Bienstock, and it was proposed that Leiber and Stoller buy Sabit&#x27;s shares. Leiber, Stoller, Goldner, and Wexler suggested their plan to Ertegun at a lunch meeting at the Plaza Hotel in New York. Leiber and Stoller told Ertegun they had no intention of buying him out, but Ertegun was aggravated by Goldner&#x27;s attitude and was convinced Wexler was conspiring with them. Wexler told Ertegun if he refused, the deal would be done without him. But the Ertegun brothers held the majority of stock while Wexler controlled about 20 percent. Ertegun started lifelong grudges against Leiber and Stoller, and his relationship with Wexler was damaged.

===Stax===
Atlantic was doing so well in early 1959 that some scheduled releases were held back. The company enjoyed two successive months of gross sales of over $1 million that summer, thanks to hits by The Coasters, The Drifters, LaVern Baker, Ray Charles, Bobby Darin, and Clyde McPhatter. Months later the company was reeling from the successive loss of its two biggest artists, Bobby Darin and Ray Charles, who together accounted for one-third of sales. Darin moved to Los Angeles and signed with Capitol. Charles signed a contract with ABC-Paramount that included higher royalties, a production deal, profit-sharing, and eventual ownership of his master tapes. &quot;I thought we were going to die&quot;, Wexler recalled. In 1990 he and Ertegun disputed the content of Charles&#x27;s contract, which caused a rift. Ertegun remained friendly with Bobby Darin, who returned to Atlantic in 1966. Ray Charles returned to Atlantic in 1977.

In 1960, Atlantic&#x27;s Memphis distributor Buster Williams contacted Wexler and told him he was pressing large quantities of &quot;Cause I Love You&quot;, a duet between Carla Thomas and her father Rufus which was released by the small label Satellite. Wexler contacted the co-owner of Satellite, Jim Stewart, who agreed to lease the record to Atlantic for $1000 plus a small royalty‚Äîthe first money the label had ever made. The deal included a $5000 payment against a five-year option on all other records. Satellite was renamed Stax after the owners, Stewart and Axton. The deal marked the start of a successful eight-year association between the two labels, giving Stax access to Atlantic&#x27;s promotions and distribution. Wexler recalled, &quot;We didn&#x27;t pay for the masters...Jim paid for the masters and then he would send us a finished tape and we would put it out. Our costs began at the production level‚Äîthe pressing, and distribution, and promotion, and advertising.&quot;

The deal to distribute Satellite&#x27;s &quot;Last Night&quot; by The Mar-Keys on the Satellite label marked the first time Atlantic began marketing outside tracks on a non-Atlantic label.

Atlantic began pressing and distributing Stax records. Wexler sent Tom Dowd to upgrade Stax&#x27;s recording equipment and facilities. Wexler was impressed by the cooperative atmosphere at the Stax studios and by its racially integrated house band, which he called &quot;an unthinkably great band&quot;. He brought Atlantic musicians to Memphis to record. Stewart and Wexler hired Al Bell, a disk jockey at a radio station in Washington D.C., to take over promotion of Stax releases. Bell was the first African-American partner in the label.

An after-hours jam by members of the Stax house band resulted in &quot;Green Onions&quot;. The single was issued in August 1962 and became the biggest instrumental hit of the year, reaching No. 1 on the R&amp;B chart and No. 3 on the pop chart, selling over one million copies. Over the next five years Stax and its subsidiary Volt provided Atlantic with many hits, such as &quot;Respect&quot; by Otis Redding, &quot;Knock on Wood&quot; by Eddie Floyd, &quot;Hold On, I&#x27;m Comin&#x27;&quot; by Sam and Dave, and &quot;Mustang Sally&quot; by Wilson Pickett.

===Soul years===
Aretha Franklin signed with Atlantic in 1966 after her contract with Columbia expired. Columbia tried to market her as a jazz singer. Jerry Wexler said, &quot;we&#x27;re gonna put her back in church.&quot; She rose to fame quickly and was called the Queen of Soul. Wexler oversaw production himself at Fame Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. The result was seven consecutive singles that made both the US Pop and Soul Top 10: &quot;I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You)&quot; (Soul No. 1, Pop No. 9), &quot;Respect&quot; (Soul and Pop No. 1), &quot;Baby, I Love You&quot; (Soul No. 1, Pop No. 4), &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman&quot; (Soul No. 2, Pop No. 8), &quot;Chain of Fools&quot; (Soul No. 1, Pop No. 2), &quot;Since You&#x27;ve Been Gone&quot; (Soul No. 1, Pop No. 5), and &quot;Think&quot; (Soul No. 1, Pop No. 7).

In late 1961, singer Solomon Burke arrived at Jerry Wexler&#x27;s office unannounced. Wexler was a fan of Burke&#x27;s and had long wanted to sign him, so when Burke told Wexler his contract with his former label had expired Wexler replied: &quot;You&#x27;re home. I&#x27;m signing you today&quot;. The first song Wexler produced with Burke was &quot;Just Out of Reach&quot;, which became a big hit in September 1961. The soul/country &amp; western crossover predated Ray Charles&#x27; similar venture by more than 6 months. Burke became a consistent big seller through the mid-1960s and scored hits on Atlantic into 1968. In 1962 folk music was booming and the label came very close to signing Peter, Paul &amp; Mary. Wexler and Ertegun pursued them vigorously, but the deal fell through at the last minute. They later discovered music publisher Artie Mogull had introduced their manager Albert Grossman to Warner Bros. executive Herman Starr, who had made the trio an irresistible offer that gave them complete creative control over the recording and packaging of their music.

The mid-1960s British Invasion led Atlantic to change its British distributor. Decca had refused access to its British acts, who usually appeared in the US on the London subsidiary. In 1966, Atlantic signed a licensing deal with Polydor which included the band Cream, whose debut album was released by Atco in 1966. In 1967, the group traveled to Atlantic&#x27;s studio in New York City to record &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; with Tom Dowd; it became a Top 5 LP in both the US and the UK, with the single &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot; reaching No. 5 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Wexler dismissed developments in pop music, dubbing the musicians &quot;the rockoids&quot;. However, Atlantic profited from moving into rock music in the 1970s when it signed Bad Company, Led Zeppelin, and Yes.

===Acquisition by Warner Bros.-Seven Arts===

Despite the huge success Atlantic was enjoying with its own artists and through its deal with Stax, by 1967, Jerry Wexler was seriously concerned about the disintegration of the old order of independent record companies; fearing for the label&#x27;s future, he began agitating for it to be sold to a larger company. Label President Ahmet Ertegun still had no desire to sell, but the balance of power had changed since the abortive takeover attempt of 1962; Atlantic&#x27;s original investor Dr Vahdi Sabit and minority stockholder Miriam Bienstock had both been bought out in September 1964 and the other remaining partner, Nesuhi Ertegun, was eventually convinced to side with Wexler. Since they jointly held more stock, Ahmet was obliged to agree to the sale.

In October 1967, Atlantic was sold to Warner Bros.-Seven Arts for US$17.5 million, although all the partners later agreed that it was a poor deal that greatly undervalued Atlantic&#x27;s true worth. Initially, Atlantic and Atco operated entirely separately from the group&#x27;s other labels, Warner Bros. Records and Reprise Records, and management did not interfere with the music division, since their ailing movie division was losing money, while the Warner recording division was booming. By mid-1968 Warner&#x27;s recording and publishing interests were generating 74% of the group&#x27;s total profits.

The sale of Atlantic Records activated a clause in the distribution agreement with Stax Records calling for renegotiation of the distribution deal and at this point, the Stax partners discovered that the deal gave Atlantic ownership of all the Stax recordings Atlantic distributed. The new Warner owners refused to relinquish ownership of the Stax masters, so the distribution deal ended in May 1968. Atlantic continues to hold the rights to Stax recordings it distributed in the 1960s.

In the wake of the takeover, Jerry Wexler&#x27;s influence in the company rapidly diminished; by his own admission, he and Ertegun had run Atlantic as &quot;utmost despots&quot; but in the new corporate structure, he found himself unwilling to accept the delegation of responsibility that his executive role dictated. He was also alienated from the &quot;rockoid&quot; white acts that were quickly becoming the label&#x27;s most profitable commodities and dispirited by the rapidly waning fortunes of the black acts he had championed, such as Ben E. King and Solomon Burke. Wexler ultimately decided to leave New York and move to Florida. Following his departure, Ertegun‚Äîwho had previously taken little interest in Atlantic&#x27;s business affairs‚Äîtook decisive control of the label and quickly became a major force in the expanding Warner music group.

During 1968, Atlantic established a new subsidiary label, Cotillion Records. The label was originally formed as an outlet for blues and deep Southern soul. Its first single, Otis Clay&#x27;s version of &quot;She&#x27;s About A Mover&quot;, was an R&amp;B hit. Cotillion&#x27;s catalog quickly expanded to include progressive rock, folk-rock, gospel, jazz and comedy. In 1976, the label started focusing on disco and R&amp;B. Among its acts were the post-Curtis Mayfield Impressions, Slave, Brook Benton, Jean Knight, Mass Production, Sister Sledge, The Velvet Underground, Stacy Lattisaw, Lou Donaldson, Mylon LeFevre, Stevie Woods, Johnny Gill, Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, Garland Green, The Dynamics, The Fabulous Counts, and The Fatback Band. Cotillion was also responsible for launching the career of Luther Vandross, who recorded for the label as part of the trio Luther. Cotillion also released the triple-albums soundtrack of the Woodstock festival film in 1970. From 1970 it also distributed Embryo Records, founded by jazz flautist Herbie Mann after his earlier Atlantic contract had expired.

In addition to establishing Cotillion, Atlantic began expanding its own roster to include rock, soul/rock, progressive rock, British bands and singer songwriters. Two female artists were personally signed by Wexler, with album releases in 1969, Dusty Springfield (&quot;Dusty in Memphis&quot;) and Lotti Golden (&quot;Motor-Cycle&quot;), although Golden also had a close working relationship with Ertegun, who was instrumental in her signing with the label. By 1969, the Atlantic 8000 series (1968‚Äì72) consisted of R&amp;B, rock, soul/rock and psychedelic acts. Other releases that year include albums by Aretha Franklin (&quot;Soul &#x27;69&quot;), Led Zeppelin (&quot;Led Zeppelin&quot;), Don Covay (&quot;House of Blue Lights&quot;), Boz Scaggs (&quot;Boz Scaggs&quot;), Roberta Flack (&quot;First Take&quot;), Wilson Pickett (&quot;Hey Jude&quot;), Mott the Hoople (&quot;Mott the Hoople&quot;), and Black Pearl (&quot;Black Pearl&quot;).

In 1969, Warner Bros.-Seven Arts was taken over by the Kinney National Company, and in the early 1970s the group was rebadged as Warner Communications. After buying Elektra Records and its sister label Nonesuch Records in 1970, Kinney combined the operations of all of its record labels under a new holding company, WEA, and also known as Warner Music Group. WEA was also used as a label for distributing the company&#x27;s artists outside North America. In January 1970, Ahmet Ertegun was successful in his executive battle against Warner Bros. Records President Mike Maitland to keep Atlantic Records autonomous. As a result, Maitland was fired by Kinney president Steve Ross. Ertegun recommended Mo Ostin to succeed Maitland as Warner Bros. Records president. With Ertegun&#x27;s power at Warners now secure, Atlantic was able to maintain autonomy through the parent company reorganizations and continue to do their own marketing, while WEA handled distribution.

===Rock era===
Some acts on the Atlantic roster in this period were British (including Led Zeppelin, Genesis, Yes, Bad Company and Phil Collins) and this was largely due to Ertegun. According to Greenberg, Ertegun had long seen the UK as a source of untapped talent. At his urging, Greenberg visited the UK six or seven times every year in search of acts to sign to the label.

For much of its early history, Jerry Wexler had been manager of the label, while Ertegun had concentrated on A&amp;R and had less interest in the business side. That changed after the sale to Warner. Although Ertegun had been forced into accepting the sale, he turned the situation to his advantage. He gained executive control of the label and influenced the Warner group. By contrast, Wexler was disenchanted by Atlantic&#x27;s move into rock; he left in 1975. Wexler&#x27;s prot√©g√© Jerry L. Greenberg replaced him and played a role in Atlantic&#x27;s success during the 1970s.

In seven years, Greenberg went from personal assistant to president of the label. Wexler had hired Greenberg and acted as his mentor, teaching him the daily operations of the record business. He learned how to treat musicians from Ertegun.

===Signing Led Zeppelin and CSN===
In 1968, by Peter Grant flew to New York with tapes of the debut album by British rock band Led Zeppelin. Ertegun and Wexler knew of the group&#x27;s leader, Jimmy Page, through The Yardbirds. Their favorable opinion was reinforced by Dusty Springfield, who recommended Atlantic sign the band. Atlantic signed the band to an exclusive five-year contract. Atlantic described it in a press release as one of the &quot;most substantial deals&quot; in the label&#x27;s history. Zeppelin recorded for Atlantic from 1968 to 1973. After the contract expired, they founded their label Swan Song and signed a distribution deal with Atlantic after being turned down by other labels.

In 1969, Stephen Stills was still signed to Atlantic under the contract dating from his time with Buffalo Springfield. His agent David Geffen went to Wexler to ask for Stills to be released from his Atlantic contract because Geffen wanted Stills&#x27; new group to sign with Columbia. Wexler lost his temper and threw Geffen out of his office, but Geffen called Ahmet Ertegun the next day, and Ertegun persuaded Geffen to convince Clive Davis at Columbia to let Atlantic sign Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash.

The trio was formed following a chance meeting between members of three leading 1960s pop groups ‚Äì Stephen Stills, David Crosby of The Byrds and Graham Nash of The Hollies. Stills and Crosby had been friends since the early 1960s; Nash had first met Crosby in the mid-1960s when The Byrds toured the UK, and he renewed the friendship when The Hollies toured the US in mid-1968. By this time creative tensions within The Hollies were coming to a head, and Nash had already decided to leave the group. Nash reunited with Crosby and met Stephen Stills (ex-Buffalo Springfield) at a party at the Los Angeles home of Cass Elliott in July 1968, during the Hollies US tour. After Crosby and Stills sang Stills&#x27; new composition &quot;You Don&#x27;t Have To Cry&quot; that evening, Nash asked them to repeat it, and chimed in with an impromptu third harmony part. The trio&#x27;s unique vocal chemistry was instantly apparent, so when Nash quit the Hollies in August 1968 and relocated to Los Angeles, the three immediately formed a trio, Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash. After failing their audition for Apple Records, thanks to Ertegun&#x27;s intervention and negotiations with David Geffen, who represented Crosby and Nash, as well as Stills, they ultimately signed with Atlantic, who gave them virtually complete freedom to record their first album.

The signing was complicated by the fact that Nash was still under contract to Epic Records (The Hollies&#x27; US distributor), but Ertegun used his diplomatic prowess to overcome this by arranging a &#x27;swap&#x27; ‚Äì he released former Buffalo Springfield member Richie Furay from his Atlantic contract, allowing Furay&#x27;s new group Poco to sign to Epic, and in exchange Columbia Records (the parent company of Epic) allowed Nash to sign to Atlantic. In the event, Ertegun and Atlantic were the clear winners. Poco achieved moderate success for Epic, but Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash&#x27;s self-titled debut album (released in May 1969) became a huge and enduring hit, reaching #6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart, spawning two US Top 40 singles, becoming a multi-platinum seller and eventually earning a place in the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

Hot on the heels of the huge success of CSNY and Led Zeppelin, British band Yes rapidly established themselves as one of the leading groups in the burgeoning progressive rock genre. Their success played a significant part in establishing the primacy of the long-playing album as the major sales format for rock music in the 1970s. After several lineup changes during 1969‚Äì70, the band settled into its &quot;classic&quot; incarnation, with guitarist Steve Howe and keyboard player Rick Wakeman, who both joined during 1971. Although the extended length of much of their material made it somewhat difficult to promote the band with single releases, their live prowess gained them an avid following and their albums were hugely successful ‚Äì their third LP &quot;The Yes Album&quot; (1971), which featured the debut of new guitarist Steve Howe, became their first big hit, reaching #4 in the UK and just scraping onto the chart in the US at #40. Beginning with their fourth album &quot;Fragile&quot;, each of the eleven albums they released between 1971 and 1991 (including the lavishly packaged live triple-album &quot;Yessongs&quot;) made the Top 20 in the US and the UK, and the double-LP &quot;Tales from Topographic Oceans&quot; (1973) and &quot;Going For The One&quot; (1977) both reached #1 in the UK.

Much of Atlantic&#x27;s renewed success as a rock label in the late 1970s can be attributed to the efforts of renowned A&amp;R manager John Kalodner. In 1974, the former photographer, record store manager and music critic joined Atlantic&#x27;s New York publicity department. In 1975, Kalodner moved to the A&amp;R department, rose rapidly through the ranks, and in 1976 he was promoted to become Atlantic&#x27;s first West Coast director of A&amp;R. Over the next four years he was instrumental in signing a string of major acts including Foreigner, AC/DC, Peter Gabriel and Phil Collins. Kalodner built his reputation by signing acts that other labels had turned down, and perhaps the most significant example of his achievements in this area was his championing of the Anglo-American band Foreigner.

The group was the brainchild of expatriate British musicians Mick Jones (ex Spooky Tooth) and Ian McDonald, one of the founding members of King Crimson. The demo tapes of the songs that eventually became their debut album (including the song &quot;Feels Like The First Time&quot;) were famously rejected by almost every major label, including Atlantic ‚Äì although their tenacious manager Bud Prager later revealed that, in retaliation for a previous bad deal, he deliberately did not approach CBS (&quot;They had screwed me out of a lot of money, so I figured I would screw them out of Foreigner. The band was never even offered to them.&quot;)

Prager persisted with Atlantic, even though their A&amp;R department and label President Jerry Greenberg repeatedly rejected Foreigner. Kalodner&#x27;s belief in the group (and a live audition) finally convinced Greenberg to allow Kalodner to sign them and take them on as his personal project. Even then, Kalodner was turned down by twenty-six producers before he found someone willing to take on the project. Despite all the resistance, Foreigner was a success. Their 1976 debut single &quot;Feels Like The First Time&quot; reached #4 on the Billboard singles chart, their self-titled debut album sold more than 4 million copies, and the subsequent singles from the album kept the group in the US charts continuously for more than a year. In the years that followed, Foreigner became one of Atlantic&#x27;s biggest successes, and one of the biggest-selling groups in history, scoring a string of international hits and selling more than 80 million albums worldwide, including 37.5 million albums in the US alone.

In 1978, Atlantic finally broke the leading UK progressive group Genesis as a major act in the US. Ahmet Ertegun had first seen them perform in the Midwest on one of their early American tours, and it was on this occasion that he also became an ardent fan of their drummer/vocalist, Phil Collins. Jerry Greenberg signed the group to Atlantic in the US in 1973 on Ertegun&#x27;s advice, but although they were very successful in Europe, Genesis remained at best a &quot;cult&quot; act in America for most of the Seventies. In the meantime, original lead singer Peter Gabriel had left the group in 1975, followed in 1977 by lead guitarist Steve Hackett, reducing the group to a three-piece. Ertegun was directly involved in the recording of the band&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;...And Then There Were Three...&quot;, personally remixing the album&#x27;s projected first single &quot;Follow You, Follow Me&quot;. Although the group did not use this version, it guided them in their subsequent production. Collins later commented, &quot;We didn&#x27;t use his version, but we knew what he was getting at. He saw something more in there that wasn&#x27;t coming out before.&quot; The released version of &quot;Follow You, Follow Me&quot; gave Genesis their first hit single in the US, the album became their first American gold record, and the experience resulted in Ertegun and Collins becoming close friends.

By 1979, Genesis drummer and singer Phil Collins was considering branching out into a solo career. Reacting to the breakup of his first marriage, he had begun writing and recording new songs at home, which were considerably different from the material he had been recording with Genesis. Although many in the industry reportedly discouraged him from going solo, Collins was strongly supported by Ertegun, who encouraged him to record an album after hearing the R&amp;B-flavoured demo tapes Collins had recorded in his garage. Ertegun also insisted on changes to the song that became Collins&#x27; debut single. After hearing the song&#x27;s sparsely-arranged opening section, Ertegun said: &quot;Where&#x27;s the backbeat, man? The kids won&#x27;t know where it is ‚Äì you&#x27;ve got to put extra drums on it.&quot; Collins replied &quot;The drums come later,&quot; to which Ertegun retorted &quot;By that time the kids will have switched over to another radio station.&quot; Acceding to Ertegun&#x27;s demand, Collins took the unusual step of overdubbing extra drums on the finished master tape, and he later commented, &quot;He (Ertegun) was quite right.&quot;

By early 1980, when Collins was recording his solo album, the record industry was suffering greatly from the impact of the worldwide economic recession, and many labels were beginning to cull their rosters and drop acts that were not providing major returns. At this same time, Genesis&#x27; contract with Atlantic was up for renewal, and Collins was yet to sign as a solo artist. As part of the negotiations, Collins and his bandmates wanted their own &#x27;vanity&#x27; label, Duke Records, but according to Kalodner, and despite Ertegun&#x27;s personal interest, the group&#x27;s demands, and their relatively modest performance in the US made Atlantic executives ambivalent about the deal. Kalodner was overseeing the recording of Collins&#x27; solo album while Atlantic were vacillating about signing the band and Collins, but it was at this point that Kalodner was abruptly dismissed from Atlantic, although he was almost immediately recruited to head the A&amp;R division at the newly formed Geffen Records. Angered by his unceremonious ejection from Atlantic, he alerted Geffen to Collins&#x27; availability, but to his chagrin, neither Geffen nor any other US label showed interest. He then alerted Virgin Records boss Richard Branson, who immediately contacted Collins&#x27; manager Tony Stratton Smith and signed Collins to Virgin in the UK as a solo act.

Although Ertegun subsequently disputed Kalodner&#x27;s account of the Genesis/Collins contract saga, he agreed that the loss of Gabriel was a big mistake, and his regret about his handling of the matter was only compounded by Gabriel&#x27;s subsequent success with Geffen. Much of this was due to Kalodner, who later admitted that, as soon as Gabriel was dropped from Atlantic, he realized he had made a mistake. In order to make amends to Gabriel, he alerted both CBS and Geffen to the fact that Gabriel was available, and after a bidding war, Gabriel signed with Geffen. They released his fourth solo album (a.k.a. &quot;Security&quot;) in 1982 to wide acclaim, and Gabriel scored a minor US hit with the single &quot;Shock The Monkey&quot;. Gabriel achieved huge international success with his fifth album &quot;So&quot; (1986), which reached #1 in the UK and #2 in the US and sold more than 5 million copies in the US. He then scored a US #1 hit with the R&amp;B-influenced single &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;, which featured the legendary Memphis Horns, and which Gabriel later described as &quot;my chance to sing like Otis Redding.&quot;

===Long Branch warehouse fire===

A fire destroyed most of Atlantic&#x27;s tape archive in the early morning of February 8, 1978. It had been stored in a non-air-conditioned warehouse in Long Branch, New Jersey. The four-story warehouse, located at 199 Broadway, was the former location of Vogel&#x27;s Department Store, before it closed down in March 1975. The building was purchased less than a week earlier and had been scheduled to reopen as a Nadler&#x27;s Furniture Center, in an effort to revitalize the downtown area.

The building was owned by the family of Sheldon Vogel, the chief financial officer of Atlantic at the time. He had recommended moving the company&#x27;s multitracks and unreleased recordings to the building after Ertegun had complained about the aforementioned tapes taking up too much space in the company&#x27;s Manhattan offices in New York.

Although master tapes of the material in Atlantic&#x27;s released back catalog survived due to being stored in New York, the fire destroyed or damaged an estimated 5,000‚Äì6,000 reels of tape, including virtually all of the company&#x27;s unreleased master tapes, alternative takes, rehearsal tapes and session multi-tracks recorded between 1948 and 1969. Atlantic was one of the first labels to record in stereo; many of the tapes that were lost were stereo &#x27;alternates&#x27; recorded in the late 1940s and 1950s (which Atlantic routinely taped simultaneously with the mono versions until the 1960s) as well as almost all of the 8-track multitrack masters recorded by Tom Dowd in the 1950s and 1960s. According to &quot;Billboard&quot; journalist Bill Holland, news of the fire was kept quiet, and one Atlantic staffer who spoke to Holland reported that he did not find out about it until a year later. Reissue producers and archivists subsequently located some tapes that were at first presumed &#x27;lost&#x27;, but which had survived because they had evidently been removed from the New Jersey archive years earlier and not returned. During the compilation of the Rhino-Atlantic John Coltrane boxed set, producer Joel Dorn located supposedly destroyed outtakes from Coltrane&#x27;s seminal 1959 album &quot;Giant Steps&quot;, plus other tapes including Bobby Darin&#x27;s original Atco demo of &quot;Dream Lover&quot; (with Fred Neil playing guitar). Atlantic archivists have since rediscovered other &#x27;lost&#x27; material including unreleased masters, alternative takes and rehearsal tapes by Ray Charles, Vann &quot;Piano Man&quot; Walls, Ornette Coleman, Lennie Tristano and Lee Konitz.

===40th Anniversary concert===
In May 1988, the label held a 40th Anniversary concert, broadcast on HBO. This concert, which was almost 13 hours in length, featured performances by a large number of their artists and included reunions of some rock legends like Led Zeppelin and Crosby, Stills, and Nash (being David Crosby&#x27;s first full band performance since being released from prison).

===2000s===
A country music division, which was founded in the 1980s, was closed in 2001.

Time Warner sold Warner Music Group to a group of investors for $2.6 billion in late 2003. The deal closed in early 2004, consolidating Elektra Records and Atlantic into one label operated in the eastern United States.
In 2006, the label denied &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic permission to release &quot;You&#x27;re Pitiful&quot;, a parody of James Blunt&#x27;s &quot;You&#x27;re Beautiful&quot;, despite Blunt&#x27;s approval. Atlantic said it was too early in Blunt&#x27;s career, and it did not want him to be a one-hit wonder. Although Yankovic could have made the parody anyway, claiming fair use, his record label, Volcano Entertainment, thought it best not to &quot;go to war&quot; with Atlantic. The parody was released online for free on June 7. He later recorded two more parodies, &quot;White &amp; Nerdy&quot;, and &quot;Do I Creep You Out&quot;, both released September 26 to replace it. He wore T-shirts reading &quot;Atlantic Records sucks&quot; while performing live and, in the music video for &quot;White &amp; Nerdy&quot;, he defaces Atlantic&#x27;s article on Wikipedia, replacing the page with &quot;YOU SUCK!&quot; in large type, which resulted in many repeat vandals.

In 2007, the label celebrated its 60th anniversary with the May 2 PBS broadcast of the &quot;American Masters&quot; documentary &quot;Atlantic Records: The House that Ahmet Built&quot; and the simultaneous Starbucks CD release of &quot;Atlantic 60th Anniversary: R&amp;B Classics Chosen By Ahmet Ertegun&quot;.

That year also saw Atlantic reach a milestone for major record labels. According to the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;, &quot;More than half of its music sales in the United States are now from digital products like downloads on iTunes and ring tones for cellphones&quot;, doing so &quot;without seeing as steep of a decline in compact disc sales as the rest of the industry.&quot;

===2020s===
In the early 2020s, Atlantic Records adopted new strategies to adapt to the changing media landscape. With new avenues for talent discovery, such as platforms like TikTok, the record company expanded its consideration for new talents to newly emerging artists on social media. Musical acts such as Flyana Boss, Efflo and Flawed Mangoes have subsequently been signed by the label as a result. In 2024, Atlantic Records signed New Zealand and South Korean singer Ros√©, a member of the girl group Blackpink, for her solo career.

<text>Ionization or ionisation is the process by which an atom or a molecule acquires a negative or positive charge by gaining or losing electrons, often in conjunction with other chemical changes. The resulting electrically charged atom or molecule is called an ion. Ionization can result from the loss of an electron after collisions with subatomic particles, collisions with other atoms, molecules, electrons, positrons, protons, antiprotons and ions, or through the interaction with electromagnetic radiation. Heterolytic bond cleavage and heterolytic substitution reactions can result in the formation of ion pairs. Ionization can occur through radioactive decay by the internal conversion process, in which an excited nucleus transfers its energy to one of the inner-shell electrons causing it to be ejected.

==Uses==
Everyday examples of gas ionization occur within a fluorescent lamp or other electrical discharge lamps. It is also used in radiation detectors such as the Geiger-M√ºller counter or the ionization chamber. The ionization process is widely used in a variety of equipment in fundamental science (e.g., mass spectrometry) and in medical treatment (e.g., radiation therapy). It is also widely used for air purification, though studies have shown harmful effects of this application.

==Production of ions==

Negatively charged ions are produced when a free electron collides with an atom and is subsequently trapped inside the electric potential barrier, releasing any excess energy. The process is known as electron capture ionization.

Positively charged ions are produced by transferring an amount of energy to a bound electron in a collision with charged particles (e.g. ions, electrons or positrons) or with photons. The threshold amount of the required energy is known as ionization energy. The study of such collisions is of fundamental importance with regard to the few-body problem, which is one of the major unsolved problems in physics. Kinematically complete experiments, i.e. experiments in which the complete momentum vector of all collision fragments (the scattered projectile, the recoiling target-ion, and the ejected electron) are determined, have contributed to major advances in the theoretical understanding of the few-body problem in recent years.

=== Adiabatic ionization ===
Adiabatic ionization is a form of ionization in which an electron is removed from or added to an atom or molecule in its lowest energy state to form an ion in its lowest energy state.

The Townsend discharge is a good example of the creation of positive ions and free electrons due to ion impact. It is a cascade reaction involving electrons in a region with a sufficiently high electric field in a gaseous medium that can be ionized, such as air. Following an original ionization event, due to such as ionizing radiation, the positive ion drifts towards the cathode, while the free electron drifts towards the anode of the device. If the electric field is strong enough, the free electron gains sufficient energy to liberate a further electron when it next collides with another molecule. The two free electrons then travel towards the anode and gain sufficient energy from the electric field to cause impact ionization when the next collisions occur; and so on. This is effectively a chain reaction of electron generation, and is dependent on the free electrons gaining sufficient energy between collisions to sustain the avalanche.

Ionization efficiency is the ratio of the number of ions formed to the number of electrons or photons used.

==Ionization energy of atoms==

The trend in the ionization energy of atoms is often used to demonstrate the periodic behavior of atoms with respect to the atomic number, as summarized by ordering atoms in Mendeleev&#x27;s table. This is a valuable tool for establishing and understanding the ordering of electrons in atomic orbitals without going into the details of wave functions or the ionization process. An example is presented in the figure to the right. The periodic abrupt decrease in ionization potential after rare gas atoms, for instance, indicates the emergence of a new shell in alkali metals. In addition, the local maximums in the ionization energy plot, moving from left to right in a row, are indicative of s, p, d, and f sub-shells.

==Semi-classical description of ionization==
Classical physics and the Bohr model of the atom can qualitatively explain photoionization and collision-mediated ionization. In these cases, during the ionization process, the energy of the electron exceeds the energy difference of the potential barrier it is trying to pass. The classical description, however, cannot describe tunnel ionization since the process involves the passage of electron through a classically forbidden potential barrier.

==Quantum mechanical description of ionization==
The interaction of atoms and molecules with sufficiently strong laser pulses or with other charged particles leads to the ionization to singly or multiply charged ions. The ionization rate, i.e. the ionization probability in unit time, can be calculated using quantum mechanics. (There are classical methods available also, like the Classical Trajectory Monte Carlo Method (CTMC), but it is not overall accepted and often criticized by the community.) There are two quantum mechanical methods exist, perturbative and non-perturbative methods like time-dependent coupled-channel or time independent close coupling methods where the wave function is expanded in a finite basis set. There are numerous options available e.g. B-splines, generalized Sturmians or Coulomb wave packets. Another non-perturbative method is to solve the corresponding Schr√∂dinger equation fully numerically on a lattice.

In general, the analytic solutions are not available, and the approximations required for manageable numerical calculations do not provide accurate enough results. However, when the laser intensity is sufficiently high, the detailed structure of the atom or molecule can be ignored and analytic solution for the ionization rate is possible.

===Tunnel ionization===
Tunnel ionization is ionization due to quantum tunneling. In classical ionization, an electron must have enough energy to make it over the potential barrier, but quantum tunneling allows the electron simply to go through the potential barrier instead of going all the way over it because of the wave nature of the electron. The probability of an electron&#x27;s tunneling through the barrier drops off exponentially with the width of the potential barrier. Therefore, an electron with a higher energy can make it further up the potential barrier, leaving a much thinner barrier to tunnel through and thus a greater chance to do so. In practice, tunnel ionization is observable when the atom or molecule is interacting with near-infrared strong laser pulses. This process can be understood as a process by which a bounded electron, through the absorption of more than one photon from the laser field, is ionized. This picture is generally known as multiphoton ionization (MPI).

Keldysh modeled the MPI process as a transition of the electron from the ground state of the atom to the Volkov states. In this model the perturbation of the ground state by the laser field is neglected and the details of atomic structure in determining the ionization probability are not taken into account. The major difficulty with Keldysh&#x27;s model was its neglect of the effects of Coulomb interaction on the final state of the electron. As it is observed from figure, the Coulomb field is not very small in magnitude compared to the potential of the laser at larger distances from the nucleus. This is in contrast to the approximation made by neglecting the potential of the laser at regions near the nucleus. Perelomov et al. included the Coulomb interaction at larger internuclear distances. Their model (which we call the PPT model) was derived for short range potential and includes the effect of the long range Coulomb interaction through the first order correction in the quasi-classical action. Larochelle et al. have compared the theoretically predicted ion versus intensity curves of rare gas atoms interacting with a Ti:Sapphire laser with experimental measurement. They have shown that the total ionization rate predicted by the PPT model fit very well the experimental ion yields for all rare gases in the intermediate regime of the Keldysh parameter.

The rate of MPI on atom with an ionization potential formula_1 in a linearly polarized laser with frequency formula_2 is given by
:formula_3

where 
* formula_4 is the Keldysh parameter,
* formula_5,
* formula_6 is the peak electric field of the laser and
* formula_7.
The coefficients formula_8, formula_9 and formula_10 are given by
:formula_11

The coefficient formula_12 is given by
:formula_13

where
:formula_14

====Quasi-static tunnel ionization====
The quasi-static tunneling (QST) is the ionization whose rate can be satisfactorily predicted by the ADK model, i.e. the limit of the PPT model when formula_15 approaches zero. The rate of QST is given by
:formula_16

As compared to formula_17 the absence of summation over n, which represent different above threshold ionization (ATI) peaks, is remarkable.

==Strong field approximation for the ionization rate==
The calculations of PPT are done in the E-gauge, meaning that the laser field is taken as electromagnetic waves. The ionization rate can also be calculated in A-gauge, which emphasizes the particle nature of light (absorbing multiple photons during ionization). This approach was adopted by Krainov model based on the earlier works of Faisal and Reiss. The resulting rate is given by

:formula_18

where:

*formula_19
*formula_20 with formula_21 being the ponderomotive energy,
*formula_22 is the minimum number of photons necessary to ionize the atom, 
*formula_23 is the double Bessel function,
*formula_24 
*formula_25 with formula_26 the angle between the momentum of the electron, p, and the electric field of the laser, F, 
* &quot;FT&quot; is the three-dimensional Fourier transform, and 
* formula_27 incorporates the Coulomb correction in the SFA model.

===Population trapping===
In calculating the rate of MPI of atoms only transitions to the continuum states are considered. Such an approximation is acceptable as long as there is no multiphoton resonance between the ground state and some excited states. However, in real situation of interaction with pulsed lasers, during the evolution of laser intensity, due to different Stark shift of the ground and excited states there is a possibility that some excited state go into multiphoton resonance with the ground state. Within the dressed atom picture, the ground state dressed by formula_28 photons and the resonant state undergo an avoided crossing at the resonance intensity formula_29. The minimum distance, formula_30, at the avoided crossing is proportional to the generalized Rabi frequency, formula_31 coupling the two states. According to Story et al., the probability of remaining in the ground state, formula_32, is given by

:formula_33

where formula_34 is the time-dependent energy difference between the two dressed states. In interaction with a short pulse, if the dynamic resonance is reached in the rising or the falling part of the pulse, the population practically remains in the ground state and the effect of multiphoton resonances may be neglected. However, if the states go onto resonance at the peak of the pulse, where formula_35, then the excited state is populated. After being populated, since the ionization potential of the excited state is small, it is expected that the electron will be instantly ionized.

In 1992, de Boer and Muller showed that Xe atoms subjected to short laser pulses could survive in the highly excited states 4f, 5f, and 6f. These states were believed to have been excited by the dynamic Stark shift of the levels into multiphoton resonance with the field during the rising part of the laser pulse. Subsequent evolution of the laser pulse did not completely ionize these states, leaving behind some highly excited atoms. We shall refer to this phenomenon as &quot;population trapping&quot;.

We mention the theoretical calculation that incomplete ionization occurs whenever there is parallel resonant excitation into a common level with ionization loss. We consider a state such as 6f of Xe which consists of 7 quasi-degnerate levels in the range of the laser bandwidth. These levels along with the continuum constitute a lambda system. The mechanism of the lambda type trapping is schematically presented in figure. At the rising part of the pulse (a) the excited state (with two degenerate levels 1 and 2) are not in multiphoton resonance with the ground state. The electron is ionized through multiphoton coupling with the continuum. As the intensity of the pulse is increased the excited state and the continuum are shifted in energy due to the Stark shift. At the peak of the pulse (b) the excited states go into multiphoton resonance with the ground state. As the intensity starts to decrease (c), the two state are coupled through continuum and the population is trapped in a coherent superposition of the two states. Under subsequent action of the same pulse, due to interference in the transition amplitudes of the lambda system, the field cannot ionize the population completely and a fraction of the population will be trapped in a coherent superposition of the quasi degenerate levels. According to this explanation the states with higher angular momentum ‚Äì with more sublevels ‚Äì would have a higher probability of trapping the population. In general the strength of the trapping will be determined by the strength of the two photon coupling between the quasi-degenerate levels via the continuum. In 1996, using a very stable laser and by minimizing the masking effects of the focal region expansion with increasing intensity, Talebpour et al. observed structures on the curves of singly charged ions of Xe, Kr and Ar. These structures were attributed to electron trapping in the strong laser field. A more unambiguous demonstration of population trapping has been reported by T. Morishita and C. D. Lin.

===Non-sequential multiple ionization===
The phenomenon of non-sequential ionization (NSI) of atoms exposed to intense laser fields has been a subject of many theoretical and experimental studies since 1983. The pioneering work began with the observation of a &quot;knee&quot; structure on the Xe2+ ion signal versus intensity curve by L‚ÄôHuillier et al. From the experimental point of view, the NS double ionization refers to processes which somehow enhance the rate of production of doubly charged ions by a huge factor at intensities below the saturation intensity of the singly charged ion. Many, on the other hand, prefer to define the NSI as a process by which two electrons are ionized nearly simultaneously. This definition implies that apart from the sequential channel formula_36 there is another channel formula_37 which is the main contribution to the production of doubly charged ions at lower intensities. The first observation of triple NSI in argon interacting with a 1¬†Œºm laser was reported by Augst et al. Later, systematically studying the NSI of all rare gas atoms, the quadruple NSI of Xe was observed. The most important conclusion of this study was the observation of the following relation between the rate of NSI to any charge state and the rate of tunnel ionization (predicted by the ADK formula) to the previous charge states; 
:formula_38

where formula_39 is the rate of quasi-static tunneling to i&#x27;th charge state and formula_40 are some constants depending on the wavelength of the laser (but not on the pulse duration).

Two models have been proposed to explain the non-sequential ionization; the shake-off model and electron re-scattering model. The shake-off (SO) model, first proposed by Fittinghoff et al., is adopted from the field of ionization of atoms by X rays and electron projectiles where the SO process is one of the major mechanisms responsible for the multiple ionization of atoms. The SO model describes the NSI process as a mechanism where one electron is ionized by the laser field and the departure of this electron is so rapid that the remaining electrons do not have enough time to adjust themselves to the new energy states. Therefore, there is a certain probability that, after the ionization of the first electron, a second electron is excited to states with higher energy (shake-up) or even ionized (shake-off). We should mention that, until now, there has been no quantitative calculation based on the SO model, and the model is still qualitative.

The electron rescattering model was independently developed by Kuchiev, Schafer &quot;et al&quot;, Corkum, Becker and Faisal and Faisal and Becker. The principal features of the model can be understood easily from Corkum&#x27;s version. Corkum&#x27;s model describes the NS ionization as a process whereby an electron is tunnel ionized. The electron then interacts with the laser field where it is accelerated away from the nuclear core. If the electron has been ionized at an appropriate phase of the field, it will pass by the position of the remaining ion half a cycle later, where it can free an additional electron by electron impact. Only half of the time the electron is released with the appropriate phase and the other half it never return to the nuclear core. The maximum kinetic energy that the returning electron can have is 3.17 times the ponderomotive potential (formula_41) of the laser. Corkum&#x27;s model places a cut-off limit on the minimum intensity (formula_41 is proportional to intensity) where ionization due to re-scattering can occur.
The re-scattering model in Kuchiev&#x27;s version (Kuchiev&#x27;s model) is quantum mechanical. The basic idea of the model is illustrated by Feynman diagrams in figure a. First both electrons are in the ground state of an atom. The lines marked a and b describe the corresponding atomic states. Then the electron a is ionized. The beginning of the ionization process is shown by the intersection with a sloped dashed line. where the MPI occurs. The propagation of the ionized electron in the laser field, during which it absorbs other photons (ATI), is shown by the full thick line. The collision of this electron with the parent atomic ion is shown by a vertical dotted line representing the Coulomb interaction between the electrons. The state marked with c describes the ion excitation to a discrete or continuum state. Figure b describes the exchange process. Kuchiev&#x27;s model, contrary to Corkum&#x27;s model, does not predict any threshold intensity for the occurrence of NS ionization.

Kuchiev did not include the Coulomb effects on the dynamics of the ionized electron. This resulted in the underestimation of the double ionization rate by a huge factor. Obviously, in the approach of Becker and Faisal (which is equivalent to Kuchiev&#x27;s model in spirit), this drawback does not exist. In fact, their model is more exact and does not suffer from the large number of approximations made by Kuchiev. Their calculation results perfectly fit with the experimental results of Walker et al. Becker and Faisal have been able to fit the experimental results on the multiple NSI of rare gas atoms using their model. As a result, the electron re-scattering can be taken as the main mechanism for the occurrence of the NSI process.

===Multiphoton ionization of inner-valence electrons and fragmentation of polyatomic molecules===
The ionization of inner valence electrons are responsible for the fragmentation of polyatomic molecules in strong laser fields. According to a qualitative model the dissociation of the molecules occurs through a three-step mechanism:
*MPI of electrons from the inner orbitals of the molecule which results in a molecular ion in ro-vibrational levels of an excited electronic state;
*Rapid radiationless transition to the high-lying ro-vibrational levels of a lower electronic state; and
*Subsequent dissociation of the ion to different fragments through various fragmentation channels.

The short pulse induced molecular fragmentation may be used as an ion source for high performance mass spectroscopy. The selectivity provided by a short pulse based source is superior to that expected when using the conventional electron ionization based sources, in particular when the identification of optical isomers is required.

==Kramers‚ÄìHenneberger frame==
The Kramers‚ÄìHenneberger(KF) frame is the non-inertial frame moving with the free electron under the influence of the harmonic laser pulse, obtained by applying a translation to the laboratory frame equal to the quiver motion of a classical electron in the laboratory frame. In other words, in the Kramers‚ÄìHenneberger frame the classical electron is at rest. Starting in the lab frame (velocity gauge), we may describe the electron with the Hamiltonian:
:formula_43
In the dipole approximation, the quiver motion of a classical electron in the laboratory frame for an arbitrary field can be obtained from the vector potential of the electromagnetic field:
:formula_44
where formula_45 for a monochromatic plane wave.

By applying a transformation to the laboratory frame equal to the quiver motion formula_46 one moves to the ‚Äòoscillating‚Äô or ‚ÄòKramers‚ÄìHenneberger‚Äô frame, in which the classical electron is at rest. By a phase factor transformation for convenience one obtains the ‚Äòspace-translated‚Äô Hamiltonian, which is unitarily equivalent to the lab-frame Hamiltonian, which contains the original potential centered on the oscillating point formula_47:
:formula_48

The utility of the KH frame lies in the fact that in this frame the laser-atom interaction can be reduced to the form of an oscillating potential energy, where the natural parameters describing the electron dynamics are formula_49 and formula_50(sometimes called the ‚Äúexcursion amplitude‚Äô, obtained from formula_46).

From here one can apply Floquet theory to calculate quasi-stationary solutions of the TDSE. In high frequency Floquet theory, to lowest order in formula_52 the system reduces to the so-called ‚Äòstructure equation‚Äô, which has the form of a typical energy-eigenvalue Schr√∂dinger equation containing the ‚Äòdressed potential‚Äô formula_53 (the cycle-average of the oscillating potential). The interpretation of the presence of formula_54 is as follows: in the oscillating frame, the nucleus has an oscillatory motion of trajectory formula_47 and formula_56 can be seen as the potential of the smeared out nuclear charge along its trajectory.

 The KH frame is thus employed in theoretical studies of strong-field ionization and atomic stabilization (a predicted phenomenon in which the ionization probability of an atom in a high-intensity, high-frequency field actually decreases for intensities above a certain threshold) in conjunction with high-frequency Floquet theory.

 The KF frame was successfully applied for different problems as well e.g. for higher-hamonic generation from a metal surface in a powerful laser field

==Dissociation ‚Äì distinction==

A substance may dissociate without necessarily producing ions. As an example, the molecules of table sugar dissociate in water (sugar is dissolved) but exist as intact neutral entities. Another subtle event is the dissociation of sodium chloride (table salt) into sodium and chlorine ions. Although it may seem as a case of ionization, in reality the ions already exist within the crystal lattice. When salt is dissociated, its constituent ions are simply surrounded by water molecules and their effects are visible (e.g. the solution becomes electrolytic). However, no transfer or displacement of electrons occurs.

<text>In physics and chemistry, ionization energy (IE) is the minimum energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron of an isolated gaseous atom, positive ion, or molecule. The first ionization energy is quantitatively expressed as
:X(g) + energy ‚ü∂ X+(g) + e‚àí
where X is any atom or molecule, X+ is the resultant ion when the original atom was stripped of a single electron, and e‚àí is the removed electron. Ionization energy is positive for neutral atoms, meaning that the ionization is an endothermic process. Roughly speaking, the closer the outermost electrons are to the nucleus of the atom, the higher the atom&#x27;s ionization energy.

In physics, ionization energy (IE) is usually expressed in electronvolts (eV) or joules (J). In chemistry, it is expressed as the energy to ionize a mole of atoms or molecules, usually as kilojoules per mole (kJ/mol) or kilocalories per mole (kcal/mol).

Comparison of ionization energies of atoms in the periodic table reveals two periodic trends which follow the rules of Coulombic attraction:

# Ionization energy generally increases from left to right within a given period (that is, row).
# Ionization energy generally decreases from top to bottom in a given group (that is, column).

The latter trend results from the outer electron shell being progressively farther from the nucleus, with the addition of one inner shell per row as one moves down the column.

The &quot;n&quot;th ionization energy refers to the amount of energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron from the species having a positive charge of (&quot;n&quot; ‚àí 1). For example, the first three ionization energies are defined as follows:
:1st ionization energy is the energy that enables the reaction X ‚ü∂ X+ + e‚àí

:2nd ionization energy is the energy that enables the reaction X+ ‚ü∂ X2+ + e‚àí

:3rd ionization energy is the energy that enables the reaction X2+ ‚ü∂ X3+ + e‚àí

The most notable influences that determine ionization energy include:
* Electron configuration: This accounts for most elements&#x27; IE, as all of their chemical and physical characteristics can be ascertained just by determining their respective electron configuration (EC).
* Nuclear charge: If the nuclear charge (atomic number) is greater, the electrons are held more tightly by the nucleus and hence the ionization energy will be greater (leading to the mentioned trend 1 within a given period).
* Number of electron shells: If the size of the atom is greater due to the presence of more shells, the electrons are held less tightly by the nucleus and the ionization energy will be smaller.
* Effective nuclear charge (&quot;Z&quot;eff): If the magnitude of electron shielding and penetration are greater, the electrons are held less tightly by the nucleus, the &quot;Z&quot;eff of the electron and the ionization energy is smaller.
* Stability: An atom having a more stable electronic configuration has a reduced tendency to lose electrons and consequently has a higher ionization energy.

Minor influences include:
* Relativistic effects: Heavier elements (especially those whose atomic number is greater than about 70) are affected by these as their electrons are approaching the speed of light. They therefore have smaller atomic radii and higher ionization energies.
* Lanthanide and actinide contraction (and scandide contraction): The shrinking of the elements affects the ionization energy, as the net charge of the nucleus is more strongly felt.
* Electron pairing energies: Half-filled subshells usually result in higher ionization energies.

The term &quot;ionization potential&quot; is an older and obsolete term for ionization energy, because the oldest method of measuring ionization energy was based on ionizing a sample and accelerating the electron removed using an electrostatic potential.

== Determination of ionization energies ==

The ionization energy of atoms, denoted &quot;E&quot;i, is measured by finding the minimal energy of light quanta (photons) or electrons accelerated to a known energy that will kick out the least bound atomic electrons. The measurement is performed in the gas phase on single atoms. While only noble gases occur as monatomic gases, other gases can be split into single atoms. Also, many solid elements can be heated and vaporized into single atoms. Monatomic vapor is contained in a previously evacuated tube that has two parallel electrodes connected to a voltage source. The ionizing excitation is introduced through the walls of the tube or produced within.

When ultraviolet light is used, the wavelength is swept down the ultraviolet range. At a certain wavelength (Œª) and frequency of light (ŒΩ=c/Œª, where c is the speed of light), the light quanta, whose energy is proportional to the frequency, will have energy high enough to dislodge the least bound electrons. These electrons will be attracted to the positive electrode, and the positive ions remaining after the photoionization will get attracted to the negatively charged electrode. These electrons and ions will establish a current through the tube. The ionization energy will be the energy of photons &quot;hŒΩ&quot;i (&quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant) that caused a steep rise in the current: &quot;E&quot;i = &quot;hŒΩ&quot;i.

When high-velocity electrons are used to ionize the atoms, they are produced by an electron gun inside a similar evacuated tube. The energy of the electron beam can be controlled by the acceleration voltages. The energy of these electrons that gives rise to a sharp onset of the current of ions and freed electrons through the tube will match the ionization energy of the atoms.

== Atoms: values and trends ==

Generally, the (&quot;N&quot;+1)th ionization energy of a particular element is larger than the &quot;N&quot;th ionization energy (it may also be noted that the ionization energy of an anion is generally less than that of cations and neutral atom for the same element). When the next ionization energy involves removing an electron from the same electron shell, the increase in ionization energy is primarily due to the increased net charge of the ion from which the electron is being removed. Electrons removed from more highly charged ions experience greater forces of electrostatic attraction; thus, their removal requires more energy. In addition, when the next ionization energy involves removing an electron from a lower electron shell, the greatly decreased distance between the nucleus and the electron also increases both the electrostatic force and the distance over which that force must be overcome to remove the electron. Both of these factors further increase the ionization energy.

Some values for elements of the third period are given in the following table:

Large jumps in the successive molar ionization energies occur when passing noble gas configurations. For example, as can be seen in the table above, the first two molar ionization energies of magnesium (stripping the two 3s electrons from a magnesium atom) are much smaller than the third, which requires stripping off a 2p electron from the neon configuration of Mg2+. That 2p electron is much closer to the nucleus than the 3s electrons removed previously.

Ionization energy is also a periodic trend within the periodic table. Moving left to right within a period, or upward within a group, the first ionization energy generally increases, with exceptions such as aluminium and sulfur in the table above. As the nuclear charge of the nucleus increases across the period, the electrostatic attraction increases between electrons and protons, hence the atomic radius decreases, and the electron cloud comes closer to the nucleus because the electrons, especially the outermost one, are held more tightly by the higher effective nuclear charge.

On moving downward within a given group, the electrons are held in higher-energy shells with higher principal quantum number n, further from the nucleus and therefore are more loosely bound so that the ionization energy decreases. The effective nuclear charge increases only slowly so that its effect is outweighed by the increase in n.

===Exceptions in ionization energies===

There are exceptions to the general trend of rising ionization energies within a period. For example, the value decreases from beryllium (: 9.3 eV) to boron (: 8.3 eV), and from nitrogen (: 14.5 eV) to oxygen (: 13.6 eV). These dips can be explained in terms of electron configurations.
Boron has its last electron in a 2p orbital, which has its electron density further away from the nucleus on average than the 2s electrons in the same shell. The 2s electrons then shield the 2p electron from the nucleus to some extent, and it is easier to remove the 2p electron from boron than to remove a 2s electron from beryllium, resulting in a lower ionization energy for B.
In oxygen, the last electron shares a doubly occupied p-orbital with an electron of opposing spin. The two electrons in the same orbital are closer together on average than two electrons in different orbitals, so that they shield each other from the nucleus more effectively and it is easier to remove one electron, resulting in a lower ionization energy.

Furthermore, after every noble gas element, the ionization energy drastically drops. This occurs because the outer electron in the alkali metals requires a much lower amount of energy to be removed from the atom than the inner shells. This also gives rise to low electronegativity values for the alkali metals.

The trends and exceptions are summarized in the following subsections:

====Ionization energy decreases when====
* Transitioning to a new period: an alkali metal easily loses one electron to leave an octet or pseudo-noble gas configuration, so those elements have only small values for IE.
* Moving from the s-block to the p-block: a p-orbital loses an electron more easily. An example is beryllium to boron, with electron configuration 1s2 2s2 2p1. The 2s electrons shield the higher-energy 2p electron from the nucleus, making it slightly easier to remove. This also happens from magnesium to aluminium.
* Occupying a p-subshell with its first electron with spin opposed to the other electrons: such as in nitrogen (: 14.5 eV) to oxygen (: 13.6 eV), as well as phosphorus (: 10.48 eV) to sulfur (: 10.36 eV). The reason for this is because oxygen, sulfur and selenium all have dipping ionization energies because of shielding effects. However, this discontinues starting from tellurium where the shielding is too small to produce a dip.
* Moving from the d-block to the p-block: as in the case of zinc (: 9.4 eV) to gallium (: 6.0 eV)
* Special case: decrease from lead (: 7.42 eV) to bismuth (: 7.29 eV). This cannot be attributed to size (the difference is minimal: lead has a covalent radius of 146 pm whereas bismuth&#x27;s is 148 pm). This is due to the spin-orbit splitting of the 6p shell (lead is removing an electron from the stabilised 6p1/2 level, but bismuth is removing one from the destabilised 6p3/2 level). Predicted ionization energies show a much greater decrease from flerovium to moscovium, one row further down the periodic table and with much larger spin-orbit effects.
* Special case: decrease from radium (: 5.27 eV) to actinium (: 5.17 eV), which is a switch from an s to a d orbital. However the analogous switch from barium (: 5.2 eV) to lanthanum (: 5.6 eV) does not show a downward change.
* Lutetium () and lawrencium () both have ionization energies lower than the previous elements. In both cases the last electron added starts a new subshell: 5d for Lu with electron configuration [Xe] 4f14 5d1 6s2, and 7p for Lr with configuration [Rn] 5f4 7s2 7p1. These dips in ionization energies for lutetium and especially lawrencium show that these elements belong in the d-block, and not lanthanum and actinium.

====Ionization energy increases when====
* Reaching Group 18 noble gas elements: This is due to their complete electron subshells, so that these elements require large amounts of energy to remove one electron.
* Group 12: The elements here, zinc (: 9.4 eV), cadmium (: 9.0 eV) and mercury (: 10.4 eV) all record sudden rising IE values in contrast to their preceding elements: copper (: 7.7 eV), silver (: 7.6 eV) and gold (: 9.2 eV), respectively. For mercury, it can be extrapolated that the relativistic stabilization of the 6s electrons increases the ionization energy, in addition to poor shielding by 4f electrons that increases the effective nuclear charge on the outer valence electrons. In addition, the closed-subshells electron configurations: [Ar] 3d10 4s2, [Kr] 4d105s2 and [Xe] 4f14 5d10 6s2 provide increased stability.
* Special case: shift from rhodium (: 7.5 eV) to palladium (: 8.3 eV). Unlike other Group 10 elements, palladium has a higher ionization energy than the preceding atom, due to its electron configuration. In contrast to nickel&#x27;s [Ar] 3d8 4s2, and platinum&#x27;s [Xe] 4f14 5d9 6s1, palladium&#x27;s electron configuration is [Kr] 4d10 5s0 (even though the Madelung rule predicts [Kr] 4d8 5s2). Finally, silver&#x27;s lower IE (: 7.6 eV) further accentuates the high value for palladium; the single added s electron is removed with a lower ionization energy than palladium, which emphasizes palladium&#x27;s high IE (as shown in the above linear table values for IE)
* The IE of gadolinium (: 6.15 eV) is somewhat higher than both the preceding (: 5.64 eV), (: 5.67 eV) and following elements (: 5.86 eV), (: 5.94 eV). This anomaly is due to the fact that gadolinium valence d-subshell borrows 1 electron from the valence f-subshell. Now the valence subshell is the d-subshell, and due to the poor shielding of positive nuclear charge by electrons of the f-subshell, the electron of the valence d-subshell experiences a greater attraction to the nucleus, therefore increasing the energy required to remove the (outermost) valence electron.
* Moving into d-block elements: The elements Sc with a 3d1 electronic configuration has a &quot;higher&quot; IP (: 6.56 eV) than the preceding element (: 6.11 eV), contrary to the decreases on moving into s-block and p-block elements. The 4s and 3d electrons have similar shielding ability: the 3d orbital forms part of the n=3 shell whose average position is closer to the nucleus than the 4s orbital and the n=4 shell, but electrons in s orbitals experience greater penetration into the nucleus than electrons in d orbitals. So the mutual shielding of 3d and 4s electrons is weak, and the effective nuclear charge acting on the ionized electron is relatively large. Yttrium () similarly has a higher IP (6.22 eV) than : 5.69 eV.
* Moving into f-block elements; The elements (: 5.18 eV) and (: 5.17 eV) have only very slightly lower IP&#x27;s than their preceding elements (: 5.21 eV) and (: 5.18 eV), though their atoms are anomalies in that they add a d-electron rather than an f-electron. As can be seen in the above graph for ionization energies, the sharp rise in IE values from (: 3.89 eV) to (: 5.21 eV) is followed by a small increase (with some fluctuations) as the f-block proceeds from to . This is due to the lanthanide contraction (for lanthanides). This decrease in ionic radius is associated with an increase in ionization energy in turn increases, since the two properties correlate to each other. As for d-block elements, the electrons are added in an inner shell, so that no new shells are formed. The shape of the added orbitals prevents them from penetrating to the nucleus so that the electrons occupying them have less shielding capacity.

====Ionization energy anomalies in groups====

Ionization energy values tend to decrease on going to heavier elements within a group as shielding is provided by more electrons and overall, the valence shells experience a weaker attraction from the nucleus, attributed to the larger covalent radius which increase on going down a group Nonetheless, this is not always the case. As one exception, in Group 10 palladium (: 8.34 eV) has a higher ionization energy than nickel (: 7.64 eV), contrary to the general decrease for the elements from technetium to xenon . Such anomalies are summarized below:
* Group 1:
** Hydrogen&#x27;s ionization energy is very high (at 13.59844 eV), compared to the alkali metals. This is due to its single electron (and hence, very small electron cloud), which is close to the nucleus. Likewise, since there are not any other electrons that may cause shielding, that single electron experiences the full net positive charge of the nucleus.
** Francium&#x27;s ionization energy is higher than the precedent alkali metal, cesium. This is due to its (and radium&#x27;s) small ionic radii owing to relativistic effects. Because of their large mass and size, this means that its electrons are traveling at extremely high speeds, which results in the electrons coming closer to the nucleus than expected, and they are consequently harder to remove (higher IE).
* Group 2: Radium&#x27;s ionization energy is higher than its antecedent alkaline earth metal barium, like francium, which is also due to relativistic effects. The electrons, especially the 1s electrons, experience &quot;very high effective nuclear charges&quot;. To avoid falling into the nucleus, the 1s electrons must move at very high speeds, which causes the special relativistic corrections to be substantially higher than the approximate classical momenta. By the uncertainty principle, this causes a relativistic contraction of the 1s orbital (and other orbitals with electron density close to the nucleus, especially ns and np orbitals). Hence this causes a cascade of electron changes, which finally results in the outermost electron shells contracting and getting closer to the nucleus.
* Group 4:
** Hafnium&#x27;s near similarity in IE with zirconium. The effects of the lanthanide contraction can still be felt &quot;after the lanthanides&quot;. It can be seen through the former&#x27;s smaller atomic radius (which contradicts the observed periodic trend ) at 159 pm (empirical value), which differs from the latter&#x27;s 155 pm. This in turn makes its ionization energies increase by 18 kJ/mol‚àí1.
** Titanium&#x27;s IE is smaller than that of both hafnium and zirconium. Hafnium&#x27;s ionization energy is similar to zirconium&#x27;s due to lanthanide contraction. However, why zirconium&#x27;s ionization energy is higher than the preceding elements&#x27; remains unclear; we cannot attribute it to atomic radius as it is higher for zirconium and hafnium by 15 pm. We also cannot invoke the &quot;condensed&quot; ionization energy, as it is more or less the same ([Ar] 3d2 4s2 for titanium, whereas [Kr] 4d2 5s2 for zirconium). Additionally, there are no half-filled nor fully filled orbitals we might compare. Hence, we can only invoke zirconium&#x27;s &quot;full&quot; electron configuration, which is 1s22s22p63s23p63d104s24p64d25s2. The presence of a full 3d-block sublevel is tantamount to a higher shielding efficiency compared to the 4d-block elements (which are only two electrons).
* Group 5: akin to Group 4, niobium and tantalum are analogous to each other, due to their electron configuration and to the lanthanide contraction affecting the latter element. Ipso facto, their significant rise in IE compared to the foremost element in the group, vanadium, can be attributed due to their full d-block electrons, in addition to their electron configuration. Another intriguing notion is niobium&#x27;s half-filled 5s orbital; due to repulsion and exchange energy (in other words the &quot;costs&quot; of putting an electron in a low-energy sublevel to completely fill it instead of putting the electron in a high-energy one) overcoming the energy gap between s- and d-(or f) block electrons, the EC does not follow the Madelung rule.
* Group 6: like its forerunners groups 4 and 5, group 6 also record high values when moving downward. Tungsten is once again similar to molybdenum due to their electron configurations. Likewise, it is also attributed to the full 3d-orbital in its electron configuration. Another reason is molybdenum&#x27;s half filled 4d orbital due to electron pair energies violating the aufbau principle.
* Groups 7-12 6th period elements (rhenium, osmium, iridium, platinum, gold and mercury): All of these elements have extremely high ionization energies compared to the elements preceding them in their respective groups. The essence of this is due to the lanthanide contraction&#x27;s influence on post lanthanides, in addition to the relativistic stabilization of the 6s orbital.
* Group 13:
** Gallium&#x27;s IE is higher than aluminum&#x27;s. This is once again due to d-orbitals, in addition to scandide contraction, providing weak shielding, and hence the effective nuclear charges are augmented.
** Thallium&#x27;s IE, due to poor shielding of 4f electrons in addition to lanthanide contraction, causes its IE to be increased in contrast to its precursor indium.
* Group 14: Lead&#x27;s unusually high ionization energy (: 7.42 eV) is, akin to that of group 13&#x27;s thallium, a result of the full 5d and 4f subshells. The lanthanide contraction and the inefficient screening of the nucleus by the 4f electrons results in slightly &quot;higher&quot; ionization energy for lead than for tin (: 7.34 eV).

== Bohr model for hydrogen atom ==
The ionization energy of the hydrogen atom (formula_1) can be evaluated in the Bohr model, which predicts that the atomic energy level formula_2 has energy

:formula_3

RH is the Rydberg constant for the hydrogen atom. For hydrogen in the ground state formula_4 and formula_5 so that the energy of the atom before ionization is simply formula_6

After ionization, the energy is zero for a motionless electron infinitely far from the proton, so that the ionization energy is

:formula_7. This agrees with the experimental value for the hydrogen atom.

==Quantum-mechanical explanation==

According to the more complete theory of quantum mechanics, the location of an electron is best described as a probability distribution within an electron cloud, i.e. atomic orbital. The energy can be calculated by integrating over this cloud. The cloud&#x27;s underlying mathematical representation is the wavefunction, which is built from Slater determinants consisting of molecular spin orbitals. These are related by Pauli&#x27;s exclusion principle to the antisymmetrized products of the atomic or molecular orbitals.

There are two main ways in which ionization energy is calculated. In general, the computation for the &quot;N&quot;th ionization energy requires calculating the energies of formula_8 and formula_9 electron systems. Calculating these energies exactly is not possible except for the simplest systems (i.e. hydrogen and hydrogen-like elements), primarily because of difficulties in integrating the electron correlation terms. Therefore, approximation methods are routinely employed, with different methods varying in complexity (computational time) and accuracy compared to empirical data. This has become a well-studied problem and is routinely done in computational chemistry. The second way of calculating ionization energies is mainly used at the lowest level of approximation, where the ionization energy is provided by Koopmans&#x27; theorem, which involves the highest occupied molecular orbital or &quot;HOMO&quot; and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital or &quot;LUMO&quot;, and states that the ionization energy of an atom or molecule is equal to the negative value of energy of the orbital from which the electron is ejected. This means that the ionization energy is equal to the negative of HOMO energy, which in a formal equation can be written as:

: formula_10

==Molecules: vertical and adiabatic ionization energy==
Ionization of molecules often leads to changes in molecular geometry, and two types of (first) ionization energy are defined ‚Äì &quot;adiabatic&quot; and &quot;vertical&quot;.

===Adiabatic ionization energy===
The adiabatic ionization energy of a molecule is the &quot;minimum&quot; amount of energy required to remove an electron from a neutral molecule, i.e. the difference between the energy of the vibrational ground state of the neutral species (v&quot; = 0 level) and that of the positive ion (v&#x27; = 0). The specific equilibrium geometry of each species does not affect this value.

===Vertical ionization energy===
Due to the possible changes in molecular geometry that may result from ionization, additional transitions may exist between the vibrational ground state of the neutral species and vibrational excited states of the positive ion. In other words, ionization is accompanied by vibrational excitation. The intensity of such transitions is explained by the Franck‚ÄìCondon principle, which predicts that the most probable and intense transition corresponds to the vibrationally excited state of the positive ion that has the same geometry as the neutral molecule. This transition is referred to as the &quot;vertical&quot; ionization energy since it is represented by a completely vertical line on a potential energy diagram (see Figure).

For a diatomic molecule, the geometry is defined by the length of a single bond. The removal of an electron from a bonding molecular orbital weakens the bond and increases the bond length. In Figure 1, the lower potential energy curve is for the neutral molecule and the upper surface is for the positive ion. Both curves plot the potential energy as a function of bond length. The horizontal lines correspond to vibrational levels with their associated vibrational wave functions. Since the ion has a weaker bond, it will have a longer bond length. This effect is represented by shifting the minimum of the potential energy curve to the right of the neutral species. The adiabatic ionization is the diagonal transition to the vibrational ground state of the ion. Vertical ionization may involve vibrational excitation of the ionic state and therefore requires greater energy.

In many circumstances, the adiabatic ionization energy is often a more interesting physical quantity since it describes the difference in energy between the two potential energy surfaces. However, due to experimental limitations, the adiabatic ionization energy is often difficult to determine, whereas the vertical detachment energy is easily identifiable and measurable.

==Analogs of ionization energy to other systems==
While the term ionization energy is largely used only for gas-phase atomic, cationic, or molecular species, there are a number of analogous quantities that consider the amount of energy required to remove an electron from other physical systems.

===Electron binding energy===
Electron binding energy is a generic term for the minimum energy needed to remove an electron from a particular electron shell for an atom or ion, due to these negatively charged electrons being held in place by the electrostatic pull of the positively charged nucleus. For example, the electron binding energy for removing a 3p3/2 electron from the chloride ion is the minimum amount of energy required to remove an electron from the chlorine atom when it has a charge of ‚àí1. In this particular example, the electron binding energy has the same magnitude as the electron affinity for the neutral chlorine atom. In another example, the electron binding energy refers to the minimum amount of energy required to remove an electron from the dicarboxylate dianion ‚àíO2C(CH2)8CO.

The graph to the right shows the binding energy for electrons in different shells in neutral atoms. The ionization energy is the lowest binding energy for a particular atom (although these are not all shown in the graph).

===Solid surfaces: work function===
Work function is the minimum amount of energy required to remove an electron from a solid surface, where the work function for a given surface is defined by the difference
:formula_11
where is the charge of an electron, is the electrostatic potential in the vacuum nearby the surface, and is the Fermi level (electrochemical potential of electrons) inside the material.

<doc id="59615" wikidata="Q55451" url="?curid=59615" title="Electric potential">
<text>Electric potential (also called the &quot;electric field potential&quot;, potential drop, the electrostatic potential) is defined as the amount of work/energy needed per unit of electric charge to move the charge from a reference point to a specific point in an electric field. More precisely, the electric potential is the energy per unit charge for a test charge that is so small that the disturbance of the field under consideration is negligible. The motion across the field is supposed to proceed with negligible acceleration, so as to avoid the test charge acquiring kinetic energy or producing radiation. By definition, the electric potential at the reference point is zero units. Typically, the reference point is earth or a point at infinity, although any point can be used. 

In classical electrostatics, the electrostatic field is a vector quantity expressed as the gradient of the electrostatic potential, which is a scalar quantity denoted by or occasionally , equal to the electric potential energy of any charged particle at any location (measured in joules) divided by the charge of that particle (measured in coulombs). By dividing out the charge on the particle a quotient is obtained that is a property of the electric field itself. In short, an electric potential is the electric potential energy per unit charge.

This value can be calculated in either a static (time-invariant) or a dynamic (time-varying) electric field at a specific time with the unit joules per coulomb (J‚ãÖC‚àí1) or volt (V). The electric potential at infinity is assumed to be zero.

In electrodynamics, when time-varying fields are present, the electric field cannot be expressed only as a scalar potential. Instead, the electric field can be expressed as both the scalar electric potential and the magnetic vector potential. The electric potential and the magnetic vector potential together form a four-vector, so that the two kinds of potential are mixed under Lorentz transformations.

Practically, the electric potential is a continuous function in all space, because a spatial derivative of a discontinuous electric potential yields an electric field of impossibly infinite magnitude. Notably, the electric potential due to an idealized point charge (proportional to , with the distance from the point charge) is continuous in all space except at the location of the point charge. Though electric field is not continuous across an idealized surface charge, it is not infinite at any point. Therefore, the electric potential is continuous across an idealized surface charge. Additionally, an idealized line of charge has electric potential (proportional to , with the radial distance from the line of charge) is continuous everywhere except on the line of charge.

== Introduction ==
Classical mechanics explores concepts such as force, energy, and potential. Force and potential energy are directly related. A net force acting on any object will cause it to accelerate. As an object moves in the direction of a force acting on it, its potential energy decreases. For example, the gravitational potential energy of a cannonball at the top of a hill is greater than at the base of the hill. As it rolls downhill, its potential energy decreases and is being translated to motion ‚Äì kinetic energy.

It is possible to define the potential of certain force fields so that the potential energy of an object in that field depends only on the position of the object with respect to the field. Two such force fields are a gravitational field and an electric field (in the absence of time-varying magnetic fields). Such fields affect objects because of the intrinsic properties (e.g., mass or charge) and positions of the objects.

An object may possess a property known as electric charge. Since an electric field exerts force on a charged object, if the object has a positive charge, the force will be in the direction of the electric field vector at the location of the charge; if the charge is negative, the force will be in the opposite direction. 

The magnitude of force is given by the quantity of the charge multiplied by the magnitude of the electric field vector,

formula_1

== Electrostatics ==
An electric potential at a point in a static electric field is given by the line integral

where is an arbitrary path from some fixed reference point to ; it is uniquely determined up to a constant that is added or subtracted from the integral. In electrostatics, the Maxwell-Faraday equation reveals that the curl formula_2 is zero, making the electric field conservative. Thus, the line integral above does not depend on the specific path chosen but only on its endpoints, making formula_3 well-defined everywhere. The gradient theorem then allows us to write:

This states that the electric field points &quot;downhill&quot; towards lower voltages. By Gauss&#x27;s law, the potential can also be found to satisfy Poisson&#x27;s equation:
formula_4

where is the total charge density and formula_5 denotes the divergence.

The concept of electric potential is closely linked with potential energy. A test charge, , has an electric potential energy, , given by

formula_6

The potential energy and hence, also the electric potential, is only defined up to an additive constant: one must arbitrarily choose a position where the potential energy and the electric potential are zero.

These equations cannot be used if i.e., in the case of a &quot;non-conservative electric field&quot; (caused by a changing magnetic field; see Maxwell&#x27;s equations). The generalization of electric potential to this case is described in the section .

=== Electric potential due to a point charge ===

The electric potential arising from a point charge, , at a distance, , from the location of is observed to be
formula_7
where is the permittivity of vacuum, is known as the Coulomb potential. Note that, in contrast to the magnitude of an electric field due to a point charge, the electric potential scales respective to the reciprocal of the radius, rather than the radius squared.

The electric potential at any location, , in a system of point charges is equal to the sum of the individual electric potentials due to every point charge in the system. This fact simplifies calculations significantly, because addition of potential (scalar) fields is much easier than addition of the electric (vector) fields. Specifically, the potential of a set of discrete point charges at points becomes

formula_8

where
* is a point at which the potential is evaluated;
* is a point at which there is a nonzero charge; and
* is the charge at the point .

And the potential of a continuous charge distribution becomes

formula_9

where
* is a point at which the potential is evaluated;
* is a region containing all the points at which the charge density is nonzero;
* is a point inside ; and
* is the charge density at the point .

The equations given above for the electric potential (and all the equations used here) are in the forms required by SI units. In some other (less common) systems of units, such as CGS-Gaussian, many of these equations would be altered.

== Generalization to electrodynamics ==

When time-varying magnetic fields are present (which is true whenever there are time-varying electric fields and vice versa), it is not possible to describe the electric field simply as a scalar potential because the electric field is no longer conservative: formula_10 is path-dependent because formula_11 (due to the Maxwell-Faraday equation).

Instead, one can still define a scalar potential by also including the magnetic vector potential . In particular, is defined to satisfy:

formula_12

where is the magnetic field. By the fundamental theorem of vector calculus, such an can always be found, since the divergence of the magnetic field is always zero due to the absence of magnetic monopoles. Now, the quantity
formula_13
&quot;is&quot; a conservative field, since the curl of formula_14 is canceled by the curl of formula_15 according to the Maxwell‚ÄìFaraday equation. One can therefore write
formula_16

where is the scalar potential defined by the conservative field .

The electrostatic potential is simply the special case of this definition where is time-invariant. On the other hand, for time-varying fields,
formula_17
unlike electrostatics.

=== Gauge freedom ===

The electrostatic potential could have any constant added to it without affecting the electric field. In electrodynamics, the electric potential has infinitely many degrees of freedom. For any (possibly time-varying or space-varying) scalar field, , we can perform the following gauge transformation to find a new set of potentials that produce exactly the same electric and magnetic fields:

formula_18

Given different choices of gauge, the electric potential could have quite different properties. In the Coulomb gauge, the electric potential is given by Poisson&#x27;s equation

formula_19

just like in electrostatics. However, in the Lorenz gauge, the electric potential is a retarded potential that propagates at the speed of light and is the solution to an inhomogeneous wave equation:

formula_20

==Units==
The SI derived unit of electric potential is the volt (in honor of Alessandro Volta), denoted as V, which is why the electric potential difference between two points in space is known as a voltage. Older units are rarely used today. Variants of the centimetre‚Äìgram‚Äìsecond system of units included a number of different units for electric potential, including the abvolt and the statvolt.

==Galvani potential versus electrochemical potential==

Inside metals (and other solids and liquids), the energy of an electron is affected not only by the electric potential, but also by the specific atomic environment that it is in. When a voltmeter is connected between two different types of metal, it measures the potential difference corrected for the different atomic environments. The quantity measured by a voltmeter is called electrochemical potential or fermi level, while the pure unadjusted electric potential, , is sometimes called the Galvani potential, . The terms &quot;voltage&quot; and &quot;electric potential&quot; are a bit ambiguous but one may refer to of these in different contexts.

<doc id="59616" wikidata="Q5444386" url="?curid=59616" title="Fermentation theory">
<text>In biochemistry, fermentation theory refers to the historical study of models of natural fermentation processes, especially alcoholic and lactic acid fermentation. Notable contributors to the theory include Justus Von Liebig and Louis Pasteur, the latter of whom developed a purely microbial basis for the fermentation process based on his experiments. Pasteur&#x27;s work on fermentation later led to his development of the germ theory of disease, which put the concept of spontaneous generation to rest. Although the fermentation process had been used extensively throughout history prior to the origin of Pasteur&#x27;s prevailing theories, the underlying biological and chemical processes were not fully understood. In the contemporary, fermentation is used in the production of various alcoholic beverages, foodstuffs, and medications.

==Overview of fermentation==

Fermentation is the anaerobic metabolic process that converts sugar into acids, gases, or alcohols in oxygen starved environments. Yeast and many other microbes commonly use fermentation to carry out anaerobic respiration necessary for survival. Even the human body carries out fermentation processes from time to time, such as during long-distance running; lactic acid will build up in muscles over the course of long-term exertion. Within the human body, lactic acid is the by-product of ATP-producing fermentation, which produces energy so the body can continue to exercise in situations where oxygen intake cannot be processed fast enough. Although fermentation yields less ATP than aerobic respiration, it can occur at a much higher rate. Fermentation has been used by humans consciously since around 5000 BCE, evidenced by jars recovered in the Iran Zagros Mountains area containing remnants of microbes similar those present in the wine-making process.

== History ==
Prior to Pasteur&#x27;s research on fermentation, there existed some preliminary competing notions of it. One scientist who had a substantial degree of influence on the theory of fermentation was Justus von Liebig. Liebig believed that fermentation was largely a process of decomposition as a consequence of the exposure of yeast to air and water. This theory was corroborated by Liebig&#x27;s observation that other decomposing matter, such as rotten plant and animal parts, interacted with sugar in a similar manner as yeast. That is, the decomposition of albuminous matter (i.e. water-soluble proteins) caused sugar to transform to alcohol. Liebig held this view until his death in 1873. A different theory was supported by Charles Cagniard de la Tour and cell theorist Theodor Schwann, who claimed that alcoholic fermentation depended on the biological processes carried out by brewer&#x27;s yeast.

Louis Pasteur&#x27;s interest in fermentation began when he noticed some remarkable properties of amyl alcohol‚Äîa by-product of lactic acid and alcohol fermentation‚Äîduring his biochemical studies. In particular, Pasteur noted its ability to ‚Äúrotate the plane of polarized light‚Äù, and its ‚Äúunsymmetric arrangement of atoms.&quot; These behaviors were characteristic of organic compounds Pasteur had previously examined, but also presented a hurdle to his own research about a &quot;law of hemihedral correlation&quot;. Pasteur had previously been attempting to derive connections between substances&#x27; chemical structures and external shape, and the optically active amyl alcohol did not follow his expectations according to the proposed &#x27;law&#x27;. Pasteur sought a reason for why there happened to be this exception, and why such a chemical compound was generated during the fermentation process in the first place. In a series of lectures later in 1860, Pasteur attempted to link optical activity and molecular asymmetry to organic origins of substances, asserting that no chemical processes were capable of converting symmetric substances (inorganic) into asymmetric ones (organic). Hence, the amyl alcohol observation provided some of the first motivations for a biological explanation of fermentation.

In 1856, Pasteur was able to observe the microbes responsible for alcoholic fermentation under a microscope, as a professor of science in the University of Lille. According to a legend originating in the 1900 biography of Pasteur, one of his chemistry students‚Äîan owner of a beetroot alcohol factory in Lille‚Äîsought aid from him after an unsuccessful year of brewing. Pasteur performed experiments at the factory in observation of the fermentation process, noticing that yeast globules became elongated after lactic acid was formed, but round and full when alcohol was fermenting correctly.

In a different observation, Pasteur inspected particles originating on grapevines under the microscope and revealed the presence of living cells. Leaving these cells immersed in grape juice resulted in active alcoholic fermentation. This observation provided evidence for ending the distinction between ‚Äòartificial‚Äô fermentation in wine and ‚Äòtrue‚Äô fermentation in yeast products. The previous incorrect distinction had stemmed in part from the fact that yeast had to be added to beer wort in order to provoke desired alcoholic fermentation, while the fermenting catalysts for wine occurred naturally on grapevines; the fermentation of wine had been viewed as &#x27;artificial&#x27; since it did not require additional catalyst, but the natural catalyst had been present on the grapevine itself. These observations provided Pasteur with a working hypothesis for future experiments.

One of the chemical processes that Pasteur studied was the fermentation of sugar into lactic acid, as occurs in the souring of milk. In an 1857 experiment, Pasteur was able to isolate microorganisms present in lactic acid ferment after the chemical process had taken place. Pasteur then cultivated the microorganisms in a culture with his laboratory. He was then able to accelerate the lactic acid fermentation process in fresh milk by administering the cultivated sample to it. This was an important step in proving his hypothesis that lactic acid fermentation was catalyzed by microorganisms.

Pasteur also experimented with the mechanisms of brewer&#x27;s yeast in the absence of organic nitrogen. By adding pure brewer&#x27;s yeast to a solution of cane sugar, ammonium salt, and yeast ash, Pasteur was able to observe the alcoholic fermentation process with all of its usual byproducts: glycerin, succinic acid, and small amounts of cellulose and fatty matters. However, if any of the ingredients were removed from the solution, no fermentation would occur. To Pasteur, this was proof that yeast required the nitrogen, minerals, and carbon from the medium for its metabolic processes, releasing carbonic acid and ethyl alcohol as byproducts. This also disproved Liebig&#x27;s theory, since there was no albuminous matter present in the medium; the decomposition of the yeast was not the driving force for the observed fermentation.

==Pasteur on spontaneous generation==
Before the 1860s and 1870s‚Äîwhen Pasteur published his work on this theory‚Äîit was believed that microorganisms and even some small animals such as frogs would spontaneously generate. Spontaneous generation was historically explained in a variety of ways. Aristotle, an ancient Greek philosopher, theorized that creatures appeared out of certain concoctions of earthly elements, such as clay or mud mixing with water and sunlight. Later on, Felix Pouchet argued for the existence of &#x27;plastic forces&#x27; within plant and animal debris capable of spontaneously generating eggs, and new organisms were born from these eggs. On top of this, a common piece of evidence that seemed to corroborate the theory was the appearance of maggots on raw meat after it was left exposed to open air.

In the 1860s and 1870s, Pasteur&#x27;s interest in spontaneous generation led him to criticize Pouchet&#x27;s theories and conduct experiments of his own. In his first experiment, he took boiled sugared yeast-water and sealed it in an airtight contraption. Feeding hot, sterile air into the mixture left it unaltered, while introducing atmospheric dust resulted in microbes and mold appearing within the mixture. This result was also strengthened by the fact that Pasteur used asbestos, a form of totally inorganic matter, to carry the atmospheric dust. In a second experiment, Pasteur used the same flasks and sugar-yeast mixture, but left it idle in &#x27;swan-neck&#x27; flasks instead of introducing any extraneous matter. Some flasks were kept open to the common air as the control group, and these exhibited mold and microbial growths within a day or two. When the swan-neck flasks failed to show these same microbial growths, Pasteur concluded that the structure of the necks blocked the passage of atmospheric dust into the solution. From the two experiments, Pasteur concluded that the atmospheric dust carried germs responsible for the &#x27;spontaneous generation&#x27; in his broths. Thus, Pasteur&#x27;s work provided proof that the emergent growth of bacteria in nutrient broths is caused by biogenesis rather than some form of spontaneous generation.

==Applications==
Today, the process of fermentation is used for a multitude of everyday applications including medication, beverages and food. Currently, companies like Genencor International uses the production of enzymes involved in fermentation to build a revenue of over $400 million a year. Many medications such as antibiotics are produced by the fermentation process. An example is the important drug cortisone, which can be prepared by the fermentation of a plant steroid known as diosgenin. 

The enzymes used in the reaction are provided by the mold Rhizopus nigricans. Just as it is commonly known, alcohol of all types and brands are also produced by way of fermentation and distillation. Moonshine is a classic example of how this is carried out. Finally, foods such as yogurt are made by fermentation processes as well. Yogurt is a fermented milk product that contains the characteristic bacterial cultures &quot;Lactobacillus bulgaricus&quot; and &quot;Streptococcus thermopiles&quot;.

<text>Glastonbury ( , ) is a town and civil parish in Somerset, England, situated at a dry point on the low-lying Somerset Levels, south of Bristol. The town had a population of 8,932 in the 2011 census. Glastonbury is less than across the River Brue from Street, which is now larger than Glastonbury.

Evidence from timber trackways such as the Sweet Track show that the town has been inhabited since Neolithic times. Glastonbury Lake Village was an Iron Age village, close to the old course of the River Brue and Sharpham Park approximately west of Glastonbury, that dates back to the Bronze Age. Centwine was the first Saxon patron of Glastonbury Abbey, which dominated the town for the next 700 years. One of the most important abbeys in England, it was the site of Edmund Ironside&#x27;s coronation as King of England in 1016. Many of the oldest surviving buildings in the town, including the Tribunal, George Hotel and Pilgrims&#x27; Inn and the Somerset Rural Life Museum, which is based at the site of a 14th-century abbey manor barn, often referred to as a tithe barn, are associated with the abbey. The Church of St John the Baptist dates from the 15th century.

The town became a centre for commerce, which led to the construction of the market cross, Glastonbury Canal and the Glastonbury and Street railway station, the largest station on the original Somerset and Dorset Railway. The Brue Valley Living Landscape is a conservation project managed by the Somerset Wildlife Trust and nearby is the Ham Wall National Nature Reserve.

Glastonbury has been described as having a New Age community, and possibly being where New Age beliefs originated at the turn of the twentieth century. It is notable for myths and legends often related to Glastonbury Tor, concerning Joseph of Arimathea, the Holy Grail and King Arthur. Joseph is said to have arrived in Glastonbury and stuck his staff into the ground, when it flowered miraculously into the Glastonbury Thorn. The presence of a landscape zodiac around the town has been suggested but no evidence has been discovered. The Glastonbury Festival, held in the nearby village of Pilton, takes its name from the town.

==History==
===Prehistory===
During the 7th millennium BC the sea level rose and flooded the valleys and low-lying ground surrounding Glastonbury so the Mesolithic people occupied seasonal camps on the higher ground, indicated by scatters of flints. The Neolithic people continued to exploit the reedswamps for their natural resources and started to construct wooden trackways. These included the Sweet Track, west of Glastonbury, which is one of the oldest engineered roads known and was the oldest timber trackway discovered in Northern Europe, until the 2009 discovery of a 6,000-year-old trackway in Belmarsh Prison. Tree-ring dating (dendrochronology) of the timbers has enabled very precise dating of the track, showing it was built in 3807 or 3806¬†BC. It has been claimed to be the oldest road in the world. The track was discovered in the course of peat digging in 1970, and is named after its discoverer, Ray Sweet. It extended across the marsh between what was then an island at Westhay, and a ridge of high ground at Shapwick, a distance close to . The track is one of a network of tracks that once crossed the Somerset Levels. Built in the 39th century BC, during the Neolithic period, the track consisted of crossed poles of ash, oak and lime (&quot;Tilia&quot;) which were driven into the waterlogged soil to support a walkway that mainly consisted of oak planks laid end-to-end. Since the discovery of the Sweet Track, it has been determined that it was built along the route of an even earlier track, the Post Track, dating from 3838 BC, and so 30¬†years older.

Glastonbury Lake Village was an Iron Age village, close to the old course of the River Brue, on the Somerset Levels near Godney, some north west of Glastonbury. It covers an area of north to south by east to west, and housed around 100 people in five to seven groups of houses, each for an extended family, with sheds and barns, made of hazel and willow covered with reeds, and surrounded either permanently or at certain times by a wooden palisade. The village was built in about 300¬†BC and occupied into the early Roman period (around AD¬†100) when it was abandoned, possibly due to a rise in the water level. It was built on a morass on an artificial foundation of timber filled with brushwood, bracken, rubble and clay.

Sharpham Park is a historic park, west of Glastonbury, which dates back to the Bronze Age.

===Middle Ages===
The name Glastonbury is derived from . When the settlement is first recorded in the 7th and the early 8th century, it was called &quot;Glestingaburg&quot;. The &quot;burg&quot; element is Old English and could refer either to a fortified place such as a burh or, more likely, a monastic enclosure; however the &quot;Glestinga&quot; element is obscure, and may derive from a Celtic personal name or from Old English (either from a name or otherwise). It may derive from a person or kindred group named Glast.
The name however is likely related to an Irish individual named Glas mac Caise &#x27;Glas son of Cas&#x27;. Glas is an ancient Irish personal name meaning &#x27;green, grey/green&#x27;. It is stated in the Life of St Patrick that he resurrected a swineherder by that name and he went to Glastonbury, to an area of the village known as &#x27;Glastonbury of the Irish&#x27; and this could well be referring to the area of Beckery (Little Ireland) where it is believed an Irish Colony established itself in the 10th century and was thus nicknamed &#x27;Little Ireland&#x27;. This area was known to the Irish as Glastimbir na n-Gaoidhil &#x27;Glastonbury of the Gaels&#x27;. (The Archaeology and History of Glastonbury Abbey - Courteney Arthur Ralegh Radford). This is the earliest source for the name Glastonbury. The modern Irish form for Glastonbury is Glaistimbir.
Hugh Ross Williamson cites a tale about St. Collen, one of the earliest hermits to inhabit the Tor before the Abbey was built by St. Patrick, which has the Saint summoned by the King of the Fairies, Gwyn, to the summit of the Tor. Upon arrival there he beholds a hovering mansion inhabited by handsomely dressed courtiers and King Gwyn on a throne of gold; holy water disperses the apparition. This is from Druid mythology, in which the mansion is &quot;made of glass&quot; so as to receive the spirits of the dead, which were supposed to depart from the summit of the Tor. This was the chief reason why the chapel, and later the church, of St. Michael were built on the high hill; St. Michael being the chief patron against diabolic attacks which the monks believed the Fairy King to be numbered among. Accordingly, Williamson posits that the Tor was named after the glassy mansion of the dead.

William of Malmesbury in his &quot;De Antiquitate Glastonie Ecclesie&quot; gives the Old Celtic &quot;Ineswitrin&quot; (or &quot;Ynys Witrin&quot;) as its earliest name, and asserts that the founder of the town was the eponymous Glast, a descendant of Cunedda.

Centwine (676‚Äì685) was the first Saxon patron of Glastonbury Abbey. King Edmund Ironside was buried at the abbey. The Domesday Book indicates that in the hundred of &quot;Glastingberiensis&quot;, the Abbey was the Lord in 1066 prior to the arrival of William the Conqueror then tenant-in chief with Godwin as Lord of &quot;Glastingberi&quot; in 1086.

To the southwest of the town centre is Beckery, which was once a village in its own right but is now part of the suburbs. Around the 7th and 8th centuries it was occupied by a small monastic community associated with a cemetery. Archaeological excavations in 2016 uncovered 50 to 60 skeletons thought to be those of monks from Beckery Chapel during the 5th or early 6th century.
Sharpham Park was granted by King Eadwig to the then abbot √Üthelwold in 957. In 1191 Sharpham Park was gifted by the soon-to-be King John I to the Abbots of Glastonbury, who remained in possession of the park and house until the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539. From 1539 to 1707 the park was owned by the Duke of Somerset, Sir Edward Seymour, brother of Queen Jane; the Thynne family of Longleat, and the family of Sir Henry Gould. Edward Dyer was born here in 1543. The house is now a private residence and Grade II* listed building. It was the birthplace of Sir Edward Dyer (died 1607) an Elizabethan poet and courtier, the writer Henry Fielding (1707‚Äì54), and the cleric William Gould.
In the 1070s St Margaret&#x27;s Chapel was built on Magdelene Street, originally as a hospital and later as almshouses for the poor. The building dates from 1444. The roof of the hall is thought to have been removed after the Dissolution, and some of the building was demolished in the 1960s. It is Grade II* listed, and a scheduled monument. Hospital of St Mary Magdalene, Glastonbury in 2010 plans were announced to restore the building.

During the Middle Ages the town largely depended on the abbey but was also a centre for the wool trade until the 18th century. A Saxon-era canal connected the abbey to the River Brue. Richard Whiting, the last Abbot of Glastonbury, was executed with two of his monks on 15 November 1539 during the dissolution of the monasteries.

During the Second Cornish Uprising of 1497 Perkin Warbeck surrendered when he heard that Giles, Lord Daubeney&#x27;s troops, loyal to Henry VII, were camped at Glastonbury.

===Early modern===
In 1693 Glastonbury, Connecticut was founded and named after the English town from which some of the settlers had emigrated. It is rumored to have originally been called &quot;Glistening Town&quot; until the mid-19th century, when the name was changed to match the spelling of Glastonbury, England, but in fact, residents of the Connecticut town believe this to be a myth, based on the Glastonbury Historical Society&#x27;s records. A representation of the Glastonbury thorn is incorporated onto the town seal.

The Somerset town&#x27;s charter of incorporation was received in 1705. Growth in the trade and economy largely depended on the drainage of the surrounding moors. The opening of the Glastonbury Canal produced an upturn in trade, and encouraged local building. The parish was part of the hundred of Glaston Twelve Hides, until the 1730s when it became a borough in its own right.

===Modern history===

By the middle of the 19th century the Glastonbury Canal drainage problems and competition from the new railways caused a decline in trade, and the town&#x27;s economy became depressed. The canal was closed on 1 July 1854, and the lock and aqueducts on the upper section were dismantled. The railway opened on 17 August 1854. The lower sections of the canal were given to the Commissioners for Sewers, for use as a drainage ditch. The final section was retained to provide a wharf for the railway company, which was used until 1936, when it passed to the Commissioners of Sewers and was filled in. The Central Somerset Railway merged with the Dorset Central Railway to become the Somerset and Dorset Railway. The main line to Glastonbury closed in 1966.

In the Northover district industrial production of sheepskins, woollen slippers and, later, boots and shoes, developed in conjunction with the growth of C&amp;J Clark in Street. Clarks still has its headquarters in Street, but shoes are no longer manufactured there. Instead, in 1993, redundant factory buildings were converted to form Clarks Village, the first purpose-built factory outlet in the United Kingdom.

During the 19th and 20th centuries tourism developed based on the rise of antiquarianism, the association with the abbey and mysticism of the town. This was aided by accessibility via the rail and road network, which has continued to support the town&#x27;s economy and led to a steady rise in resident population since 1801.

Glastonbury received national media coverage in 1999 when cannabis plants were found in the town&#x27;s floral displays.

==Mythology and legends==

Glastonbury is notable for myths and legends concerning Joseph of Arimathea, the Holy Grail and King Arthur as recorded by ancient historians William of Malmesbury, Venerable Bede, Gerald of Wales and Geoffrey of Monmouth. Many long-standing and cherished legends were examined in a four-year study by archaeologists, led by Professor Roberta Gilchrist, at the University of Reading, who, amongst other findings, speculated that the connection with King Arthur and his Queen, Guinevere, was created deliberately by the monks in 1184 to meet a financial crisis caused by a devastating fire. Other myths examined include the visit by Jesus, the building of the oldest church in England, and the flowering of the walking stick. Roberta Gilchrist stated, &quot;We didn&#x27;t claim to disprove the legendary associations, nor would we wish to&quot;. The site of King Arthur&#x27;s supposed grave contained material dating from between the 11th and 15th centuries. Gilchrist said, &quot;That doesn&#x27;t dispel the Arthurian legend, it just means the pit [20th century archaeologist Ralegh Radford] excavated he rather over-claimed.&quot; The study made new archaeological finds; its leader found Glastonbury to be a remarkable archaeological site. The new results were reported on the Glastonbury Abbey Web site, and were to be incorporated into the Abbey&#x27;s guidebook; however, the leader of the study, who became a trustee of Glastonbury, said &quot;We are not in the business of destroying people&#x27;s beliefs ... A thousand years of beliefs and legends are part of the intangible history of this remarkable place&quot;. Gilchrist went on to say, &quot;archaeology can help us to understand how legends evolve and what people in the past believed&quot;. She noted that the project has actually uncovered the first definitive proof of occupation at the Glastonbury Abbey site during the fifth century‚Äîwhen Arthur allegedly lived.

The legend that Joseph of Arimathea retrieved certain holy relics was introduced by the French poet Robert de Boron in his 13th-century version of the grail story, thought to have been a trilogy though only fragments of the later books survive today. The work became the inspiration for the later Vulgate Cycle of Arthurian tales.

De Boron&#x27;s account relates how Joseph captured Jesus&#x27;s blood in a cup (the &quot;Holy Grail&quot;) which was subsequently brought to Britain. The Vulgate Cycle reworked Boron&#x27;s original tale. Joseph of Arimathea was no longer the chief character in the Grail origin: Joseph&#x27;s son, Josephus, took over his role of the Grail keeper.
The earliest versions of the grail romance, however, do not call the grail &quot;holy&quot; or mention anything about blood, Joseph or Glastonbury.

In 1191, monks at the abbey claimed to have found the graves of Arthur and Guinevere to the south of the Lady Chapel of the Abbey Church, which was visited by a number of contemporary historians including Giraldus Cambrensis. The remains were later moved and were lost during the Reformation. Many scholars suspect that this discovery was a pious forgery to substantiate the antiquity of Glastonbury&#x27;s foundation, and increase its renown.

An early Welsh poem links Arthur to the Tor in an account of a confrontation between Arthur and Melwas, who had kidnapped Queen Guinevere.
Joseph is said to have arrived in Glastonbury by boat over the flooded Somerset Levels. On disembarking he stuck his staff into the ground and it flowered miraculously into the Glastonbury Thorn (also called Holy Thorn). This is said to explain a hybrid Crataegus monogyna (hawthorn) tree that only grows within a few miles of Glastonbury, and which flowers twice annually, once in spring and again around Christmas time (depending on the weather). Each year a sprig of thorn is cut, by the local Anglican vicar and the eldest child from St John&#x27;s School, and sent to the Queen.

The original Holy Thorn was a centre of pilgrimage in the Middle Ages but was chopped down during the English Civil War. A replacement thorn was planted in the 20th century on Wearyall hill (originally in 1951 to mark the Festival of Britain, but the thorn had to be replanted the following year as the first attempt did not take). The Wearyall Hill Holy Thorn was vandalised in 2010 and all its branches were chopped off. It initially showed signs of recovery but now (2014) appears to be dead. A new sapling has been planted nearby. Many other examples of the thorn grow throughout Glastonbury including those in the grounds of Glastonbury Abbey, St Johns Church and Chalice Well.

Today, Glastonbury Abbey presents itself as &quot;traditionally the oldest above-ground Christian church in the world,&quot; which according to the legend was built at Joseph&#x27;s behest to house the Holy Grail, 65 or so years after the death of Jesus. The legend also says that as a child, Jesus had visited Glastonbury along with Joseph. The legend probably was encouraged during the medieval period when religious relics and pilgrimages were profitable business for abbeys. William Blake mentioned the legend in a poem that became a popular hymn, &quot;Jerusalem&quot;.

===Glastonbury zodiac===
In 1934 artist Katherine Maltwood suggested a landscape zodiac, a map of the stars on a gigantic scale, formed by features in the landscape such as roads, streams and field boundaries, could be found situated around Glastonbury. She held that the &quot;temple&quot; was created by Sumerians about 2700¬†BC. The idea of a prehistoric landscape zodiac fell into disrepute when two independent studies examined the Glastonbury Zodiac, one by Ian Burrow in 1975 and the other by Tom Williamson and Liz Bellamy in 1983. These both used standard methods of landscape historical research. Both studies concluded that the evidence contradicted the idea of an ancient zodiac. The eye of Capricorn identified by Maltwood was a haystack. The western wing of the Aquarius phoenix was a road laid in 1782 to run around Glastonbury, and older maps dating back to the 1620s show the road had no predecessors. The Cancer boat (not a crab as in conventional western astrology) consists of a network of 18th-century drainage ditches and paths. There are some Neolithic paths preserved in the peat of the bog formerly comprising most of the area, but none of the known paths match the lines of the zodiac features. There is no support for this theory, or for the existence of the &quot;temple&quot; in any form, from conventional archaeologists. Glastonbury is also said to be the centre of several ley lines.

==Governance and public services==

The town council is made up of 16 members, and is based at Glastonbury Town Hall, Magdalene Street. The town hall was built in 1814 and has a two-storey late Georgian ashlar front. It is a Grade II* listed building.

For local government purposes, since 1 April 2023, Glastonbury comes under the unitary authority of Somerset Council. Prior to this, it was part of the non-metropolitan district of Mendip, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, having previously been part of Glastonbury Municipal Borough.

The town&#x27;s retained fire station is operated by Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service. Police and ambulance services are provided by Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the South Western Ambulance Service. There are two doctors&#x27; surgeries in Glastonbury, and a National Health Service community hospital operated by Somerset Primary Care Trust which opened in 2005.

There are 4 electoral wards within &quot;Glastonbury&quot; having in total the same population as is mentioned above.

Glastonbury falls within the newly created Glastonbury and Somerton constituency, represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. The Member of Parliament is Liberal Democrat, Sarah Dyke.

Glastonbury is twinned with the Greek island of Patmos, and Lalibela, Ethiopia.

==Geography==

The walk up the Tor to the distinctive tower at the summit (the partially restored remains of an old church) is rewarded by vistas of the mid-Somerset area, including the Levels which are drained marshland. From there, on a dry point, above sea level, it is easy to appreciate how Glastonbury was once an island and, in the winter, the surrounding moors are often flooded, giving that appearance once more. It is an agricultural region typically with open fields of permanent grass, surrounded by ditches with willow trees. Access to the moors and Levels is by &quot;droves&quot;, i.e., green lanes. The Levels and inland moors can be below peak tides and have large areas of peat. The low-lying areas are underlain by much older Triassic age formations of Upper Lias sand that protrude to form what would once have been islands and include Glastonbury Tor. The lowland landscape was formed only during the last 10,000¬†years, following the end of the last ice age.

The low-lying damp ground can produce a visual effect known as a Fata Morgana. This optical phenomenon occurs because rays of light are strongly bent when they pass through air layers of different temperatures in a steep thermal inversion where an atmospheric duct has formed. The Italian name &quot;Fata Morgana&quot; is derived from the name of Morgan le Fay, who was alternatively known as Morgane, Morgain, Morgana and other variants. Morgan le Fay was described as a powerful sorceress and antagonist of King Arthur and Queen Guinevere in the Arthurian legend.

Glastonbury is less than across the River Brue from the village of Street. At the time of King Arthur the Brue formed a lake just south of the hilly ground on which Glastonbury stands. This lake is one of the locations suggested by Arthurian legend as the home of the Lady of the Lake. Pomparles Bridge stood at the western end of this lake, guarding Glastonbury from the south, and it is suggested that it was here that Sir Bedivere threw Excalibur into the waters after King Arthur fell at the Battle of Camlann. The old bridge was replaced by a reinforced concrete arch bridge in 1911.

Until the 13th century, the direct route to the sea at Highbridge was prevented by gravel banks and peat near Westhay. The course of the river partially encircled Glastonbury from the south, around the western side (through Beckery), and then north through the Panborough-Bleadney gap in the Wedmore-Wookey Hills, to join the River Axe just north of Bleadney. This route made it difficult for the officials of Glastonbury Abbey to transport produce from their outlying estates to the abbey, and when the valley of the River Axe was in flood it backed up to flood Glastonbury itself. Some time between 1230 and 1250 a new channel was constructed westwards into Meare Pool north of Meare, and further westwards to Mark Moor. The Brue Valley Living Landscape is a conservation project based on the Somerset Levels and Moors and managed by the Somerset Wildlife Trust. The project commenced in January 2009 and aims to restore, recreate and reconnect habitat, ensuring that wildlife is enhanced and capable of sustaining itself in the face of climate change, while guaranteeing farmers and other landowners can continue to use their land profitably. It is one of an increasing number of landscape-scale conservation projects in the UK.
The Ham Wall National Nature Reserve, west of Glastonbury, is managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. This new wetland habitat has been established from out peat diggings and now consists of areas of reedbed, wet scrub, open water and peripheral grassland and woodland. Bird species living on the site include the bearded tit and the Eurasian bittern.

The Whitelake River rises between two low limestone ridges to the north of Glastonbury, part of the southern edge of the Mendip Hills. The confluence of the two small streams that make the Whitelake River is on Worthy Farm, the site of the Glastonbury Festival, between the small villages of Pilton and Pylle.

==Climate==
Along with the rest of South West England, Glastonbury has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter mean minimum temperatures of are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, however convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600¬†hours. In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most of the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. Most of the rainfall in autumn and winter is caused by the Atlantic depressions, which is when they are most active. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around . About 8‚Äì15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.

==Economy==

Glastonbury is a centre for religious tourism and pilgrimage. As with many towns of similar size, the centre is not as thriving as it once was but Glastonbury supports a large number of alternative shops.

The outskirts of the town contain a DIY shop, a former sheepskin and slipper factory site, once owned by Morlands, which is slowly being redeveloped. The site of the old Morlands factory was scheduled for demolition and redevelopment into a new light industrial park, although there have been some protests that the buildings should be reused rather than being demolished. As part of the redevelopment of the site a project has been established by the Glastonbury Community Development Trust to provide support for local unemployed people applying for employment, starting in self-employment and accessing work-related training.

==Landmarks==
According to the Glastonbury Conservation Area Appraisal of July 2010, there are approximately 170 listed buildings or structures in the town&#x27;s designated conservation area, of which eight are listed grade I, six are listed grade II* and the remainder are listed grade II.

The Tribunal was a medieval merchant&#x27;s house, used as the Abbey courthouse and, during the Monmouth Rebellion trials, by Judge Jeffreys. It now serves as a museum containing possessions and works of art from the Glastonbury Lake Village which were preserved in almost perfect condition in the peat after the village was abandoned. The museum is run by the Glastonbury Antiquarian Society. The building also houses the tourist information centre.
The octagonal Market Cross was built in 1846 by Benjamin Ferrey.

The George Hotel and Pilgrims&#x27; Inn was built in the late 15th century to accommodate visitors to Glastonbury Abbey, which is open to visitors. It has been designated as a Grade I listed building. The front of the 3-storey building is divided into 3 tiers of panels with traceried heads. Above the right of centre entrance are 3 carved panels with arms of the Abbey and Edward IV.

The Somerset Rural Life Museum is a museum of the social and agricultural history of Somerset, housed in buildings surrounding a 14th-century barn once belonging to Glastonbury Abbey. It was used for the storage of arable produce, particularly wheat and rye, from the abbey&#x27;s home farm of approximately . Threshing and winnowing would also have been carried out in the barn, which was built from local shelly limestone with thick timbers supporting the stone tiling of the roof. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building, and is a scheduled monument.
The Chalice Well is a holy well at the foot of the Tor, covered by a wooden well-cover with wrought-iron decoration made in 1919. The natural spring has been in almost constant use for at least two thousand years. Water issues from the spring at a rate of per day and has never failed, even during drought. Iron oxide deposits give the water a reddish hue, as dissolved ferrous oxide becomes oxygenated at the surface and is precipitated, providing chalybeate waters. As with the hot springs in nearby Bath, the water is believed to possess healing qualities. The well is about deep, with two underground chambers at its bottom. It is often portrayed as a symbol of the female aspect of deity, with the male symbolised by Glastonbury Tor (however, some consider Glastonbury Tor to be a &#x27;hugh bounteous female figure&#x27;). As such, it is a popular destination for pilgrims in search of the divine feminine, including modern Pagans. The well is however popular with all faiths and in 2001 became a World Peace Garden.

Just a short distance from the Chalice Well site, across a road known as Well House Lane, can be found the &quot;White Spring&quot;, where a temple has been created in the 21st century. Whilst the waters of the Chalice Well are touched red with iron, the water of the latter is white with calcite. Some people consider the red water of Chalice Well to have male properties, whilst the white water of White Spring has female qualities. Both springs rise from caverns underneath the Tor and it is claimed that both have healing in their flow.

The building now used as the White Spring Temple was originally a Victorian-built well house, erected by the local water board in 1872. Around that time, an outbreak of cholera in the area caused great concern and the natural caves were dug out, and a stone collection chamber was constructed to ensure the flow of a quality water supply. Study of the flow of water into the collection chamber has shown that the builders also tapped into other springs, besides the White Spring and judging from the high iron content of one of these springs, it appears that a small offshoot of Chalice Well finds its way under Well House Lane to emerge beside the White Spring. However, after building the reservoir, the water board soon discovered that the high calciferous content of the water caused pipes to block and by the end of the 19th century water was piped into Glastonbury from out of town. After lying derelict for many years, the water board sold off the well house, which is now maintained by a group of volunteers as a &quot;water temple&quot;. On the outside of the building is a tap where visitors and locals can collect the water of the White Spring.

==Transport==
The Glastonbury Canal ran just over through two locks from Glastonbury to Highbridge where it entered the Bristol Channel in the early 19th century, but it became uneconomic with the arrival of the railway in the 1840s.

Glastonbury and Street railway station was the biggest station on the original Somerset &amp; Dorset Joint Railway main line from Highbridge to Evercreech Junction until closed in 1966 under the Beeching axe. Opened in 1854 as Glastonbury, and renamed in 1886, it had three platforms, two for Evercreech to Highbridge services and one for the branch service to Wells. The station had a large goods yard controlled from a signal box. The site is now a timber yard for a local company. Replica level crossing gates have been placed at the entrance.

The nearest railway station is at but there is no direct bus route linking it to Glastonbury. There are convenient bus connections between Glastonbury and the railway stations at (over an hour travelling time) and at . It is also served by Berrys Coaches daily &#x27;Superfast&#x27; service to and from London.

The main road in the town is the A39 which passes through Glastonbury from Wells connecting the town with Street and the M5 motorway. The other roads around the town are small and run across the levels generally following the drainage ditches. Local bus services are provided by Buses of Somerset (part of First), First West of England, Frome Bus &amp; Libra Travel. The main routes are to Bristol via Wells, to Bridgwater, to Yeovil via Street and to Taunton. There is also a coach service to London Victoria provided by Berrys.

==Local media==
Television programmes and local news is provided by BBC West and ITV West Country from the Mendip TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Somerset on 95.5 FM, Heart West on 102.6 FM, Greatest Hits Radio South West on 102.4 FM, Worthy FM on 87.7 FM which broadcast during The Glastonbury Festival and GWS Radio on 107.1 FM, a community radio station.

The town&#x27;s local newspapers are the Mid Somerset Series, Western Daily Press, Somerset County Gazette and Somerset Live.

==Education==
There are several infant and primary schools in Glastonbury and the surrounding villages. Secondary education is provided by St Dunstan&#x27;s School. In 2017, the school had 327 students between the ages of 11 and 16 years. It is named after St. Dunstan, an abbot of Glastonbury Abbey, who went on to become the Archbishop of Canterbury in 960 AD. The school was built in 1958 with major building work, at a cost of ¬£1.2¬†million, in 1998, adding the science block and the sports hall. It was designated as a specialist Arts College in 2004, and the ¬£800,000 spent at this time paid for the Performing Arts studio and facilities to support students with special educational needs. Tor School is a pupil referral unit based on Beckery New Road, which caters for 14-16-year-old students who have been excluded from mainstream education, or who have been referred for medical reasons.

Strode College in Street provides academic and vocational courses for those aged 16‚Äì18 and adult education. A tertiary institution and further education college, most of the courses it offers are A-levels or Business and Technology Education Councils (BTECs). The college also provides some university-level courses, and is part of The University of Plymouth Colleges network.

==Religious sites and faith groups==

Glastonbury may have been a site of religious importance in pre-Christian times. The abbey was founded by Britons, and dates to at least the early 7th century, although later medieval Christian legend claimed that the abbey was founded by Joseph of Arimathea in the 1st century. This legend is intimately tied to Robert de Boron&#x27;s version of the Holy Grail story and to Glastonbury&#x27;s connection to King Arthur, which dates at least to the early 12th century. William of Malmesbury called this structure &quot;the oldest church in England,&quot; and thenceforth it was known simply as the Old Church, inasmuch as it had existed for many years prior to the 7th century as a Celtic religious centre. In his &quot;History of the English Church and People,&quot; written in the early eighth century, the Venerable Bede provides details regarding its construction to early missionaries. Glastonbury fell into Saxon hands after the Battle of Peonnum in 658. King Ine of Wessex enriched the endowment of the community of monks already established at Glastonbury. He is said to have directed that a stone church be built in 712. The Abbey Church was enlarged in the 10th century by the Abbot of Glastonbury, Saint Dunstan, the central figure in the 10th-century revival of English monastic life. He instituted the Benedictine Rule at Glastonbury and built new cloisters. Dunstan became Archbishop of Canterbury in 960. In 1184, a great fire at Glastonbury destroyed the monastic buildings. Reconstruction began almost immediately and the Lady Chapel, which includes the well, was consecrated in 1186.

The abbey had a violent end during the Dissolution and the buildings were progressively destroyed as their stones were removed for use in local building work. The remains of the Abbot&#x27;s Kitchen (a grade I listed building.) and the Lady Chapel are particularly well-preserved set in of parkland. It is approached by the Abbey Gatehouse which was built in the mid-14th century and completely restored in 1810.

There is also a strong Irish connection to Glastonbury as it is said to be along a route of pilgrimage from Ireland to Rome. It is supposed that St. Patrick and St. Brigid both came to the area and both Saints are documented by William of Malmesbury as having done so. There are Chapels named after them too - St. Patrick&#x27;s Chapel, Glastonbury is within the Abbey grounds and St. Brigid&#x27;s Chapel is at Beckery (Little Ireland).

The Church of St Benedict was rebuilt by Abbot Richard Beere in about 1520. This is now an Anglican church and is linked with the parishes of St John&#x27;s Church in Glastonbury and St Mary&#x27;s &amp; All Saints Church in the village of Meare as a joint benefice.

Described as &quot;one of the most ambitious parish churches in Somerset&quot;, the current Church of St John the Baptist dates from the 15th century and has been designated as a Grade I listed building. The church is laid out in a cruciform plan with an aisled nave and a clerestorey of seven bays. The west tower has elaborate buttressing, panelling and battlements and at 134¬Ω feet (about 41 metres), is the second tallest parish church tower in Somerset. Recent excavations in the nave have revealed the foundations of a large central tower, possibly of Saxon origin, and a later Norman nave arcade on the same plan as the existing one. A central tower survived until the 15th century, but is believed to have collapsed, at which time the church was rebuilt. The interior of the church includes four 15th-century tomb-chests, some 15th-century stained glass in the chancel, medieval vestments, and a domestic cupboard of about 1500 which was once at Witham Charterhouse.

In the centuries that followed the Reformation, many religious denominations came to Glastonbury to establish chapels and meeting houses. For such a relatively small town, Glastonbury has a remarkably diverse history of Christian places of worship, further enriched by the fact that several of these movements saw break-away factions, typically setting up new meeting places as a result of doctrinal disagreements, leaving behind them a legacy which would require a highly specialized degree of study in order to chart their respective histories and places of practice. Amongst their number have been Puritans/Undetermined Protestants, Quakers, Independents, Baptists, Presbyterians, Congregationalists, Wesleyan and Primitive Methodists, Salvationists, Plymouth Brethren, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and Pentecostals.

The United Reformed Church on the High Street was built in 1814 and altered in 1898. It stands on the site of the Ship Inn where meetings were held during the 18th century. It is Grade II listed.

Glastonbury Methodist Church on Lambrook Street was built in 1843 and has a galleried interior, typical of a non-conformist chapel of that period, but an unusual number of stained glass windows. Close by the front of the church is an ancient pond, which was later covered to form a brick-arched reservoir. This is mentioned in property deeds of 1821, and is still accessible, containing approximately 31,500 gallons of water.

The Methodist Church on Lambrook street was originally the Glastonbury Wesleyan Methodist Chapel. A Primitive Methodist Chapel was built on Northload Street in 1844, with an adjoining house added for a minister in 1869. This chapel was closed in 1968, since which time it has had a number of different uses, being described in 2007 as the Maitreya Monastery, prior to which it had been the Archangel Michael Soul Therapy Centre.

The Bove Town Gospel Hall has been a place of worship in the town since at least 1889, when it was listed as a mission of the Plymouth Brethren. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses originally occupied a Kingdom Hall on Archer&#x27;s Way from 1942. This transferred to Church Lane in 1964, and subsequently to its present site on Old Wells Road. The Gospel Hall was registered for the solemnizing of marriages in 1964

The Catholic Church of Our Lady St Mary of Glastonbury was built, on land near to the Abbey, in 1939. A statue based on a 14th-century metal seal was blessed in 1955 and crowned in 1965 restoring the Marian shrine that had been in the Abbey prior to the reformation. The Shrine is now the home of the Community of Our Lady of Glastonbury, a Catholic Benedictine Monastery founded in August 2019.

The Glastonbury Order of Druids was formed on Mayday 1988.

Sufism has been long established in Glastonbury. Zikrs are held weekly in private homes, and on the first Sunday of every month a zikr is held at St Margaret&#x27;s Chapel in Magdalene Street. A Sufi charity shop was established in Glastonbury in 1999, and supports missionary work in Africa. This shop was opened after Sheikh Nazim came to Glastonbury to visit the Abbey. Here he declared, &quot;This is the spiritual heart of England ... It is from here that the spiritual new age will begin and to here that Jesus will return&quot;.

The pagan Glastonbury Goddess Temple was founded in 2002 and registered as a place of worship the following year. It is self-described as the first temple of its kind to exist in Europe in over a thousand years.

In April 2012, it was reported by The Guardian newspaper that, according to the Pilgrim Reception Centre in the town, Glastonbury had around seventy different faith groups. Some of these groups attended a special ceremony to celebrate this diversity, held in the Chalice Well Gardens on 21 April of that year.

The 22nd Jagannatha Ratha-yatra Krishna Festival took place in Glastonbury on Sunday 4 October 2015. Devotees of the Krishna Consciousness movement travelled to the town from London, Bath, Bristol and elsewhere to join with locals in a procession and Kirtan.

Glastonbury also headquarters the British Orthodox Church which is independent Oriental Orthodox denomination since 2015

Glastonbury has a particular significance for members of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith in that Wellesley Tudor Pole, founder of the Chalice Well Trust, was one of the earliest and most prominent adherents of this faith in the United Kingdom.

==Sports==
The local football team is Glastonbury F.C. They joined the Western Football League in 1919 and have won the Western Football League title three times in their history. The club are now playing in the Somerset County Football League.

Glastonbury Cricket Club previously competed in the West of England Premier League, one of the ECB Premier Leagues, the highest level of recreational cricket in England and Wales. The club plays at the Tor Leisure Ground, which used to stage Somerset County Cricket Club first-class fixtures.

The town is on the route of the Samaritans Way South West.

==Culture==
In a 1904 novel by Charles Whistler entitled &quot;A Prince of Cornwall&quot; Glastonbury in the days of Ine of Wessex is portrayed. It is also a setting in the Warlord Chronicles, a trilogy of books about Arthurian Britain written by Bernard Cornwell. Modern fiction has also used Glastonbury as a setting including The Age of Misrule series of books by Mark Chadbourn in which the Watchmen appear, a group selected from Anglican priests in and around Glastonbury to safeguard knowledge of a gate to the Otherworld on top of Glastonbury Tor. John Cowper Powys&#x27;s novel &quot;A Glastonbury Romance&quot; is set in Glastonbury and is concerned with the Grail. The historical mystery novel &quot;Grave Goods&quot; by Diana Norman (writing under the pen name Ariana Frankin) is set in Glastonbury just after the abbey fire and concerns the supposed graves of Arthur and Guinevere, as well as featuring other landmarks such as the Tor.

The Children&#x27;s World charity grew out of the festival and is based in the town. It is known internationally (as &quot;Children&#x27;s World International&quot;). It was set up by Arabella Churchill in 1981 to provide drama participation and creative play and to work creatively in educational settings, providing social and emotional benefits for all children, particularly those with special needs. Children&#x27;s World International is the sister charity of Children&#x27;s World and was started in 1999 to work with children in the Balkans, in conjunction with Balkan Sunflowers and Save the Children. They also run the Glastonbury Children&#x27;s Festival each August.

The local Brass Band is Glastonbury Brass which is currently placed in the 1st section for the West of England area. The band was founded in 2017 when the old Yeovil Town Band relocated after running into financial difficulty following a &quot;notice to quit&quot; on its rehearsal facility in September 2016. The band is featured twice on the Haiku Salut album &quot;There Is No Elsewhere&quot; (2018) and can be heard on the tracks &quot;Cold To Crack The Stones&quot; and &quot;The More And Moreness.&quot; In February 2020, the band was involved in the launch of Johnny Mars&#x27;s &quot;Dare to Dream&quot; project aimed at raising awareness of the effects mankind is having on the world.

With strong Arthurian connections and historic and prehistoric associations, Glastonbury was chosen to host the festivals.

The more recent Glastonbury Festival of Performing Arts, founded in 1970, is now the largest open-air music and performing arts festival in the world. Although it is named after Glastonbury, it is actually held at Worthy Farm between the small villages of Pilton and Pylle, east of the town of Glastonbury. The festival is best known for its contemporary music, but also features dance, comedy, theatre, circus, cabaret and many other arts.

<text>The Psychidae (bagworm moths, also simply bagworms or bagmoths) are a family of the Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). The bagworm family is fairly small, with about 1,350 species described. Bagworm species are found globally, with some, such as the snailcase bagworm (&quot;Apterona helicoidella&quot;), in modern times settling continents where they are not native.

Another common name for the Psychidae is &quot;case moths&quot;, but this is just as well used for the case-bearers (Coleophoridae). The names refer to the habits of caterpillars of these two families, which build small protective cases in which they can hide. The bagworms belong to the superfamily Tineoidea, which is a basal lineage of the Ditrysia (as is Gelechioidea, which includes case-bearers). This means that the bagworms and case-bearers are only as closely related to each other as either is to butterflies (Rhopalocera).

Most bagworms are inoffensive to humans and inconspicuous; some are occasional nuisance pests. However, a few species can become more serious pests, and have caused significant damage e.g. to wattle (&quot;Acacia mearnsii&quot;) in South Africa and orange (&quot;Citrus √ó sinensis&quot;) in Florida. If detected early, picking the cases from the trees while in their pupa stage is an effective way to check an infestation; otherwise, insecticides are used. One bagworm species, the fangalabola (&quot;Deborrea malgassa&quot;) of Madagascar, is in some places encouraged to breed on wattle trees, because its pupae are collected as a protein-rich food.

==Description==
The caterpillar larvae of Psychidae construct cases out of silk and environmental materials such as sand, soil, lichen, or plant materials. These cases are attached to rocks, trees or fences while resting or during their pupa stage, but are otherwise mobile. The larvae of some species eat lichen, while others prefer green leaves. In many species, the adult females lack wings and are therefore difficult to identify accurately. Case-bearer cases are usually much smaller, flimsier, and consist mainly of silk, while bagworm &quot;bags&quot; resemble caddisfly cases in their outward appearance ‚Äì a mass of (mainly) plant detritus spun together with silk on the inside.

Bagworm cases range in size from less than 1¬†cm to 15¬†cm among some tropical species. Each species makes a case particular to its species, making the case more useful to identify the species than the creature itself. Cases among the more primitive species are flat. More specialized species exhibit a greater variety of case size, shape, and composition, usually narrowing on both ends. The attachment substance used to affix the bag to host plant, or structure, can be very strong, sometimes requiring a great deal of force to remove. Body markings are rare. Adult females of many bagworm species are larviform, with only vestigial wings, legs, and mouthparts. In some species, parthenogenesis is known. The adult males of most species are strong fliers with well-developed wings and feathery antennae but survive only long enough to reproduce due to underdeveloped mouthparts that prevent them from feeding. Most male bagworm wings have few of the scales characteristic of most moths, instead having a thin covering of hairs.

==Ecology==
In the larval stage, bagworms extend their head and thorax from their mobile case to devour the leaves of host plants, often leading to the death of their hosts. Trees infested with bagworms exhibit increasingly damaged foliage as the infestation increases until the leaves are stripped bare. Some bagworms are specialized in their host plants (monophagous), while others can feed on a variety of plant species (polyphagous). A few species also consume small arthropods (such as the camphor scale &quot;Pseudaonidia duplex&quot;, a scale insect). One bagworm species was found to eat an orb-web of &quot;Plebs sachalinensis&quot; (Araneae, Araneidae) entirely.

Since bagworm cases are composed of silk and the materials from their habitat, they are naturally camouflaged from predators. Predators include birds and other insects. Birds often eat the egg-laden bodies of female bagworms after they have died. Since the eggs are very hard-shelled, they can pass through the bird&#x27;s digestive system unharmed, promoting the spread of the species over wide areas.

A bagworm begins to build its case as soon as it hatches. Once the case is built, only adult males ever leave the case, never to return, when they take flight to find a mate. Bagworms add material to the front of the case as they grow, excreting waste materials through the opening in the back of the case. When satiated with leaves, a bagworm caterpillar secures its case and pupates. The adult female, which is wingless, either emerges from the case long enough for breeding or remains in the case while the male extends his abdomen into the female&#x27;s case to breed. Females lay their eggs in their case and die. The female evergreen bagworm (&quot;Thyridopteryx ephemeraeformis&quot;) dies without laying eggs, and the larval bagworm offspring emerge from the parent&#x27;s body. Some bagworm species are parthenogenetic, meaning their eggs develop without male fertilization. Each bagworm generation lives just long enough as adults to mate and reproduce in their annual cycle.

<doc id="59623" wikidata="Q2896709" url="?curid=59623" title="Endomorphism ring">
<text>In mathematics, the endomorphisms of an abelian group &quot;X&quot; form a ring. This ring is called the endomorphism ring of &quot;X&quot;, denoted by End(&quot;X&quot;); the set of all homomorphisms of &quot;X&quot; into itself. Addition of endomorphisms arises naturally in a pointwise manner and multiplication via endomorphism composition. Using these operations, the set of endomorphisms of an abelian group forms a (unital) ring, with the zero map formula_1 as additive identity and the identity map formula_2 as multiplicative identity.

The functions involved are restricted to what is defined as a homomorphism in the context, which depends upon the category of the object under consideration. The endomorphism ring consequently encodes several internal properties of the object. As the endomorphism ring is often an algebra over some ring &quot;R,&quot; this may also be called the endomorphism algebra.

An abelian group is the same thing as a module over the ring of integers, which is the initial object in the category of rings. In a similar fashion, if &quot;R&quot; is any commutative ring, the endomorphisms of an &quot;R&quot;-module form an algebra over &quot;R&quot; by the same axioms and derivation. In particular, if &quot;R&quot; is a field, its modules &quot;M&quot; are vector spaces and the endomorphism ring of each is an algebra over the field &quot;R&quot;.

== Description ==
Let be an abelian group and we consider the group homomorphisms from &quot;A&quot; into &quot;A&quot;. Then addition of two such homomorphisms may be defined pointwise to produce another group homomorphism. Explicitly, given two such homomorphisms &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot;, the sum of &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; is the homomorphism . Under this operation End(&quot;A&quot;) is an abelian group. With the additional operation of composition of homomorphisms, End(&quot;A&quot;) is a ring with multiplicative identity. This composition is explicitly . The multiplicative identity is the identity homomorphism on &quot;A&quot;. The additive inverses are the pointwise inverses. 

If the set &quot;A&quot; does not form an &quot;abelian&quot; group, then the above construction is not necessarily well-defined, as then the sum of two homomorphisms need not be a homomorphism. However, the closure of the set of endomorphisms under the above operations is a canonical example of a near-ring that is not a ring.

== Properties ==
* Endomorphism rings always have additive and multiplicative identities, respectively the zero map and identity map.
* Endomorphism rings are associative, but typically non-commutative.
* If a module is simple, then its endomorphism ring is a division ring (this is sometimes called Schur&#x27;s lemma).
* A module is indecomposable if and only if its endomorphism ring does not contain any non-trivial idempotent elements. If the module is an injective module, then indecomposability is equivalent to the endomorphism ring being a local ring.
* For a semisimple module, the endomorphism ring is a von Neumann regular ring.
* The endomorphism ring of a nonzero right uniserial module has either one or two maximal right ideals. If the module is Artinian, Noetherian, projective or injective, then the endomorphism ring has a unique maximal ideal, so that it is a local ring.
* The endomorphism ring of an Artinian uniform module is a local ring.
* The endomorphism ring of a module with finite composition length is a semiprimary ring.
* The endomorphism ring of a continuous module or discrete module is a clean ring.
* If an &quot;R&quot; module is finitely generated and projective (that is, a progenerator), then the endomorphism ring of the module and &quot;R&quot; share all Morita invariant properties. A fundamental result of Morita theory is that all rings equivalent to &quot;R&quot; arise as endomorphism rings of progenerators.

== Examples ==
* In the category of &quot;R&quot;-modules, the endomorphism ring of an &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;M&quot; will only use the &quot;R&quot;-module homomorphisms, which are typically a proper subset of the abelian group homomorphisms. When &quot;M&quot; is a finitely generated projective module, the endomorphism ring is central to Morita equivalence of module categories.
* For any abelian group formula_3, formula_4, since any matrix in formula_5 carries a natural homomorphism structure of formula_6 as follows: 
*: formula_7
: One can use this isomorphism to construct many non-commutative endomorphism rings. For example: formula_8, since formula_9. 
: Also, when formula_10 is a field, there is a canonical isomorphism formula_11, so formula_12, that is, the endomorphism ring of a formula_13-vector space is identified with the ring of &quot;n&quot;-by-&quot;n&quot; matrices with entries in formula_13. More generally, the endomorphism algebra of the free module formula_15 is naturally formula_16-by-formula_16 matrices with entries in the ring formula_18.
* As a particular example of the last point, for any ring &quot;R&quot; with unity, , where the elements of &quot;R&quot; act on &quot;R&quot; by &quot;left&quot; multiplication.
* In general, endomorphism rings can be defined for the objects of any preadditive category.

<doc id="59627" wikidata="Q473845" url="?curid=59627" title="Columbine High School massacre">
<text>A school shooting and attempted bombing occurred on April 20, 1999, at Columbine High School in Columbine, Colorado, United States. The perpetrators, twelfth-grade students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, murdered twelve students and one teacher; ten were killed in the school library, where Harris and Klebold subsequently died by suicide. Twenty-one additional people were injured by gunshots, and gunfire was exchanged with the police. Another three people were injured trying to escape. The Columbine massacre was the deadliest mass shooting at a K-12 school in U.S. history until December 2012. It is still considered one of the most infamous massacres in the U.S. for inspiring many other school shootings and bombings; the word &quot;Columbine&quot; has since become a byword for modern school shootings. , Columbine is still both the deadliest mass shooting and school shooting in Colorado, and one of the deadliest mass shootings in the United States.

Harris and Klebold, who planned for roughly a year, and hoped to have a large number of victims, intended for the attack to &quot;primarily&quot; be a bombing and only secondarily a shooting. However, the pair chose to launch a shooting attack after the several homemade bombs they planted in the school failed to detonate. Their motive remains inconclusive. The police were slow to enter the school and were heavily criticized for not intervening during the shooting. The incident resulted in the introduction of the immediate action rapid deployment (IARD) tactic, which is used in active-shooter situations, and an increased emphasis on school security with zero-tolerance policies. The violence sparked debates over American gun culture and gun control laws, high school cliques, subcultures (e.g. goths), outcasts, and school bullying, as well as teenage use of pharmaceutical antidepressants, the Internet, and violence in video games and film.

Many makeshift memorials were created after the massacre, including ones employing victims Rachel Scott&#x27;s car and John Tomlin&#x27;s truck. Fifteen crosses for the victims and the shooters were erected on top of a hill in Clement Park. The crosses for Harris and Klebold were later removed following controversy. Planning for a permanent memorial began in June 1999, and the resulting Columbine Memorial opened to the public in September 2007.

The shooting has inspired dozens of copycat killings, dubbed the Columbine effect, including many deadlier shootings across the world.

==Perpetrators==
===Eric Harris===
Eric David Harris (April 9, 1981‚Äì April 20, 1999) was born in Wichita, Kansas. The Harris family relocated often, as Harris&#x27;s father was a U.S. Air Force transport pilot. His mother was a homemaker. The family moved from Plattsburgh, New York, to Littleton, Colorado, in July 1993, when his father retired from military service.

The Harris family lived in rented accommodations for their first three years in the Littleton area. During this time, Harris attended Ken Caryl Middle School, where he met Klebold. In 1996, the Harris family purchased a house south of CHS. Harris&#x27;s older brother attended college at the University of Colorado Boulder.

===Dylan Klebold===
Dylan Bennet Klebold ( ; September 11, 1981‚Äì April 20, 1999) was born in Lakewood, Colorado. His parents were pacifists and attended a Lutheran church with their children. Both Dylan and his older brother, Byron, attended confirmation classes in accordance with the Lutheran tradition. As had been the case with his older brother, Klebold was named after a renowned poet‚Äîin his case Dylan Thomas.

Klebold attended Normandy Elementary for first and second grade before transferring to Governor&#x27;s Ranch Elementary, and became part of the CHIPS (&quot;Challenging High Intellectual Potential Students&quot;) program.

==Background==

===Criminal history===
In 1996, 15-year-old Eric Harris created a private website on America Online (AOL), initially to host levels (known as WADs) Harris created for use in the first-person shooter video games &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;Doom II&quot;, and &quot;Quake&quot;. On the site, Harris began a web log (&quot;blog&quot;), which included details about Harris sneaking out of the house to cause mischief and vandalism, such as lighting fireworks with Klebold and others. These were known as &quot;Rebel Missions&quot;, and Harris&#x27;s blog primarily consisted of &quot;mission logs&quot;. Beginning in early 1997, the blog postings began to show the first signs of Harris&#x27;s anger against society. By the end of the year, the site contained instructions on how to make explosives. Harris&#x27;s site attracted few visitors and caused no concern until August 1997, after Harris ended a blog post detailing murderous fantasies with &quot;All I want to do is kill and injure as many of you as I can, especially a few people. Like Brooks Brown.&quot; Brown was a classmate of his. After Brown&#x27;s parents viewed the site, they contacted the Jefferson County Sheriff&#x27;s Office on August 7, 1997. An investigator wrote a draft affidavit to request a search warrant for the Harris household, but it was never submitted to a judge.

On January 30, 1998, Harris and Klebold were arrested for breaking into a white van parked near Littleton and stealing tools and computer equipment. They would subsequently attend a joint court hearing, where they pled guilty to the felony theft. The judge sentenced them to a juvenile diversion program. As a result, both delinquents attended mandatory classes such as anger management and talked with diversion officers. They both were eventually released from diversion several weeks early because of positive actions in the program and put on probation.

===Writings===
Shortly after the court hearing for the van break-in, Harris reverted his website back to just hosting user-created levels of &quot;Doom&quot;. He began to write his thoughts down in a journal. Klebold had already been keeping a personal journal since March 1997; as early as November of that year, Klebold had mentioned going on a killing spree. Klebold used his journal to vent about his personal problems as well as what he&#x27;d wear and use during the attack. In both their journals, Harris and Klebold would later plot the attack. Soon after beginning his journal, Harris typed out a plan for an attack which included possibly escaping to a foreign country after the massacre, or hijacking an aircraft at Denver International Airport and crashing it into New York City.

Klebold and Harris both made entries in their journals on topics related to sexuality. Klebold expressed shame for his sexual interests, which included bondage and foot fetishism, stating that, &quot;My humanity has a foot fetish, &amp; bondage exteme (sic) liking. I try to thwart it...&quot; Harris described his desire for sex with women, especially his desire of raping and torturing women in his bedroom. Harris also expressed interest in cannibalism, stating that he would like to dismember a woman with whom he could have &quot;animalistic sex&quot; and eat her flesh.

Harris and Klebold&#x27;s schoolwork also foreshadowed the massacre. They both displayed themes of violence in their creative writing projects. In December 1997, Harris wrote a paper on school shootings titled &quot;Guns in School&quot;, and a poem from the perspective of a bullet. Klebold wrote a short story about a man killing students which worried his teacher so much that she alerted his parents.

Both had also actively researched war and murder. For one project, Harris wrote a paper on Nazi Germany and Klebold wrote a paper on Charles Manson. In a psychology class, Harris wrote he dreamed of going on a shooting spree with Klebold. Harris&#x27;s journals described several experimental bomb detonations.

Nearly a year before the massacre, Klebold wrote a message in Harris&#x27;s 1998 yearbook: &quot;killing enemies, blowing up stuff, killing cops!! My wrath for January&#x27;s incident will be godlike. Not to mention our revenge in the commons&quot;; &quot;the commons&quot; was slang for the school cafeteria.

===Tapes===
====Basement tapes====
Harris and Klebold were both enrolled in video-production classes and kept five video tapes that were recorded with school video equipment. Only two of these, &quot;Hitmen for Hire&quot; and &quot;Rampart Range&quot;, and part of a third known as &quot;Radioactive Clothing&quot;, have been released. The remaining three tapes detailed their plans and reasons for the massacre, including the ways they hid their weapons and deceived their parents. Most were shot in the Harris family basement, and are thus known as the Basement Tapes. Thirty minutes before the attack, they made a final video saying goodbye and apologizing to their friends and families.

In December 1999, before anyone besides investigators had seen them, &quot;Time&quot; magazine published an article on these tapes. The victims&#x27; family members threatened to sue Jefferson County. As a result, select victim families and journalists were allowed to view them, though the tapes were then withheld from the public and, in 2011, destroyed for fear of inspiring future massacres. Transcripts of some of the dialogue and a short clip recorded surreptitiously by a victim&#x27;s father still exist. The pair claimed they were going to make copies of the tapes to send to news stations but never did so.

When an economics class had Harris make an ad for a business, he and Klebold made a video called &quot;Hitmen for Hire&quot; on December 8, 1998, which was released in February 2004. It depicts them as part of the Trench Coat Mafia, a clique in the school who wore black trench coats and opposed jocks, extorting money for protecting preps from bullies. Klebold and Harris themselves were apparently not a part of the Trench Coat Mafia but were friends with some of its members. They wore black trench coats on the day of the massacre, and the &quot;Hitmen for Hire&quot; video seemed a kind of dress rehearsal, showing them walking the halls of the school, and shooting bullies outside with fake guns.

On October 21, 2003, a video was released showing the pair doing target practice on March 6, 1999, in nearby foothills known as Rampart Range, with the weapons they would use in the massacre.

====Nixon tape====
Before the massacre, Harris left a micro cassette labeled &quot;Nixon&quot; on the kitchen table. On it Harris said &quot;It is less than nine hours now,&quot; placing the recording at some time around 2:30¬†a.m. He went on to say &quot;People will die because of me,&quot; and &quot;It will be a day that will be remembered forever.&quot;

==Weaponry==
=== Guns ===
In the months prior to the attacks, Harris and Klebold acquired two 9mm firearms and two 12-gauge shotguns. Harris had a Hi-Point 995 carbine with thirteen 10-round magazines and a Savage-Springfield 67H pump shotgun. Klebold used a 9mm Intratec TEC-DC9 semi-automatic handgun with one 52-, one 32-, and one 28-round magazine and a Stevens 311D double-barreled shotgun. Harris&#x27; shotgun was sawed-off to around and Klebold shortened his shotgun&#x27;s length to , a felony under the National Firearms Act.
On November 22, 1998, their friend Robyn Anderson purchased a carbine rifle and the two shotguns for the pair at the Tanner Gun Show, as they were too young to legally purchase the guns themselves. After the attack, she told investigators that she had believed the pair wanted the weapons for target shooting and denied that she had prior knowledge of their plans. Anderson was not charged.

Harris and Klebold both held part-time jobs at a local Blackjack Pizza. Through Philip Duran, one of their coworkers, Klebold bought a TEC-9 handgun from Mark Manes for $500 at another gun show on January 23. Manes, Manes&#x27; girlfriend, and Duran are all in the Rampart Range video. After the massacre, Manes and Duran were both prosecuted. Each was charged with supplying a handgun to a minor and possession of a sawed-off shotgun. Manes and Duran were sentenced to a total of six years and four-and-a-half years, respectively, in prison.

=== Explosives ===
In addition to the firearms, the complex and highly planned attack involved several improvised explosive devices. Harris and Klebold constructed a total of 99 bombs. These included pipe bombs, carbon-dioxide cartridges filled with gunpowder (called &quot;crickets&quot;), Molotov cocktails, and propane tanks converted to bombs. The propane bombs were used in the cafeteria, the shooters&#x27; cars, and in another location intended as a diversion. For ignition, they used storm matches, cannon fuses, and model rocket igniters as well as timing devices built from mechanical alarm clocks for the propane bombs. During the massacre, they carried match strikers taped to their forearms for easy ignition of the pipe bombs and bombs.

Harris also experimented with napalm, and envisioned a kind of backpack and flamethrower. They both attempted to get another friend and coworker, Chris Morris, who was a part of the Trench Coat Mafia, to keep the napalm at his house, but he refused. Harris also tried to recruit him to be a third shooter but played it off as a joke when rebuked.

==== Pipe bombs ====
Harris&#x27;s website contained instructions on making pipe bombs and Molotovs, and the extensive use of shrapnel. Harris&#x27;s father once discovered one of his pipe bombs. Harris&#x27;s journal logged the creation of 25 pipe bombs.

Klebold scared his coworkers by once bringing a pipe bomb into work. They would give various nicknames to their pipe bombs. After the massacre, two pipe bombs had been left in Klebold&#x27;s bedroom, one named &quot;Vengeance&quot; and another &quot;Atlanta&quot;, presumably after the Olympic Park bombing.

====Cafeteria bombs====
They had in their possession eight propane tanks all converted into bombs. The weekend before the shooting, Harris and Klebold bought two propane tanks and other supplies from a hardware store. They bought six propane tanks on the morning of the attack. Harris was caught on a Texaco gas station security camera at 9:12¬†a.m. buying a Blue Rhino propane tank. Both cafeteria bombs included a single 20-pound tank, attached pipe bombs, and supporting gasoline canisters alongside.

====Car bombs====
Both car bombs were made from two 20-pound propane tanks, pipe bombs, and various containers filled with gasoline were spread throughout the vehicles. Eight pipe bombs were placed in Klebold&#x27;s car, and one in Harris&#x27;.

=== Knives ===
Harris and Klebold were both equipped with knives, but investigators do not believe they ever utilized them during the massacre. Harris had a boot knife on his belt and a &quot;Khyber-pass&quot; machete bowie knife taped to the back of his ankle. Both had an &quot;R&quot;, referencing Harris&#x27;s alias &quot;REB&quot;, etched into the handle, and the machete had a swastika on the sheath. Klebold had a &quot;Cobra&quot; knife mounted to his belt on the left side as well as a switchblade in his right pocket.

==The massacre==
According to the shooters&#x27; respective journals and video tapes, it is believed by investigators that the pair intended to detonate their propane bombs in the cafeteria at the busiest lunch hour, killing hundreds of students. After this, they would shoot and stab survivors, as well as lob bombs. Bombs set in their cars in the parking lot would also eventually detonate, killing more students as well as possibly any police officers, paramedics, firemen, or reporters who had come to the school. However, the bombs in the cafeteria and cars failed to detonate.

Several official sources claim they planned to shoot the fleeing survivors from the parking lot, but when the bombs failed, they moved to the staircase on the hill at the west side. Other sources claim the top of the staircase where the massacre began was their preferred spot to wait for the bombs to go off all along.

A total of 188 rounds of ammunition were fired by the perpetrators during the massacre. Firing nearly twice as much as Klebold, Harris fired his carbine rifle a total of 96 times: 47 shots outside, 36 shots inside, and 13 shots in the library. Harris also discharged his shotgun 25 times: 21 times in the library and four times inside. Klebold fired the TEC-9 handgun 55 times: three shots outside, 31 shots inside, and 21 shots in the library. Klebold also fired 12 rounds from his double-barreled shotgun: twice outside, four times inside, and six times in the library. Law enforcement officers fired 141 rounds during exchanges of gunfire with the shooters.

=== Planting the bombs ===
On Tuesday morning, April 20, 1999, Harris and Klebold placed two duffel bags in the cafeteria. Each bag contained propane bombs, set to detonate during the &quot;A&quot; lunch shift, which began at 11:15¬†a.m.

No witness recalled seeing the duffel bags being added to the 400 or so backpacks that were already in the cafeteria. The security staff at CHS did not observe the bags being placed in the cafeteria; a custodian was replacing the school security videotape at around 11:14¬†a.m. Shortly after the massacre, police speculated the bombs were placed during this &quot;tape change&quot;. They also investigated whether the bombs were placed during the &quot;after-prom&quot; party held the prior weekend. Some Internet sleuths claim the bomb placement can be seen on the surveillance video at around 10:58¬†a.m. Harris and Klebold are seen in the tapes planting the bombs in casual school clothes separately.

Jefferson County Sheriff&#x27;s Deputy Neil Gardner was assigned to the high school as a full-time school resource officer. Gardner usually ate lunch with students in the cafeteria, but on April 20 he was eating lunch in his patrol car at the northwest corner of the campus, watching students in the Smokers&#x27; Pit in Clement Park, a meadow adjacent to the school.

Two backpacks filled with pipe bombs, aerosol canisters, and small propane bombs were also placed in a field about south of CHS, and south of the fire station. The bombs were intended as a diversion to draw firefighters and emergency personnel away from the school. Only the pipe bombs and one of the aerosol canisters detonated, causing a small fire, which was quickly extinguished by the fire department. It went off after first having been moved. Bomb technicians immediately examined the bombs and relayed to police at the school the possibility of devices with motion activators.

Harris and Klebold changed clothes and returned separately to CHS. Harris parked his vehicle in the junior student parking lot, and Klebold parked in the adjoining senior student parking lot. The school cafeteria was their primary bomb target; the cafeteria had a long outside window-wall, ground-level doors, and was just north of the senior parking lot. The library was located above the cafeteria in the second-story of the window-wall. Each car contained bombs.

As Harris pulled into the parking lot, he encountered classmate Brooks Brown, with whom he had recently patched up a longstanding series of disputes. According to Brown, who was smoking a cigarette, he was surprised to see Harris, whom he earlier noted had been absent from a class test. Harris, a good student, was unlikely to miss school days with important academic obligation. Brown berated Harris for missing the test. Harris, acting unconcerned, replied &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter anymore.&quot; Harris went on: &quot;Brooks, I like you now. Get out of here. Go home.&quot; Brown, feeling uneasy and already prepared to skip his next class, walked away down South Pierce Street.

Meanwhile, Harris and Klebold armed themselves, using straps and webbing to conceal weapons beneath their trench coats. They lugged bags containing bombs and ammunition. Harris had concealed his shotgun in one of the bags. Beneath the trench coats, Harris wore a military bandolier and a white T-shirt with the inscription &quot;Natural Selection&quot; in black letters, a mantra he had adopted; Klebold wore a black T-shirt with &quot;Wrath&quot; in red letters.

The cafeteria bombs failed to detonate. Had these explosives detonated as intended, they would have killed or severely wounded the 488 students in the cafeteria and damaged the school&#x27;s structure, collapsing the library into the cafeteria and possibly killing more students and staff.

===11:19¬†a.m.: Shooting begins===
At 11:19¬†a.m., 17-year-old Rachel Scott and her friend Richard Castaldo were having lunch and sitting on the grass next to the west entrance of the school. Klebold threw a pipe bomb towards the parking lot; the bomb only partially detonated, causing it to give off smoke. Castaldo thought it was no more than a crude senior prank. Likewise, several students during the incident first thought that they were watching a prank.

The two allegedly returned to where Rachel Scott and Richard Castaldo lay on the ground injured. Scott was killed instantly when she was hit four times with rounds fired from Harris&#x27;s carbine; one shot was to the left temple. Castaldo was shot eight times in the chest, arm, and abdomen by both Harris and Klebold; he fell unconscious to the ground and was left paralyzed below the chest.

After firing twice, Klebold&#x27;s TEC-9 jammed, and he was forced to temporarily cease shooting to fix it, which he did by reloading a new magazine into his pistol. Meanwhile, Harris took off his trenchcoat and aimed his carbine down the west staircase in the direction of three students: Daniel Rohrbough, Sean Graves, and Lance Kirklin. The students presumed they were paintball guns, and were about to walk up the staircase directly below the shooters. Harris fired ten times, killing Rohrbough and injuring Graves and Kirklin. William David Sanders, a teacher and coach at the school, was in the cafeteria when he heard the gunfire and began warning students.

Harris turned west and fired seven shots in the direction of five students sitting on the grassy hillside adjacent to the steps and opposite the west entrance of the school: Michael Johnson was hit in the face, leg, and arm but ran and escaped; Mark Taylor was shot in the chest, arms, and leg and fell to the ground, where he faked death; the other three escaped uninjured.

Klebold walked down the steps toward the cafeteria. He first shot once at the body of Dan Rohrbough with his shotgun, and then came up to Lance Kirklin, who was already wounded and lying on the ground, weakly calling for help. Klebold said, &quot;Sure. I&#x27;ll help you,&quot; then shot Kirklin in the jaw with his shotgun. Although near-fatally injured, Kirklin would survive. Graves‚Äîparalyzed beneath the waist‚Äîhad crawled into the doorway of the cafeteria&#x27;s west entrance and collapsed. He rubbed his blood on his face and played dead. After shooting Kirklin, Klebold walked towards the cafeteria door. He then stepped over the injured Graves to enter the cafeteria. Graves remembers Klebold saying, &quot;Sorry, dude.&quot;

Klebold only briefly entered the cafeteria and did not shoot at the several people still inside. Officials speculated that Klebold went to check on the propane bombs. Harris was still on top of the stairs shooting, and severely wounded and partially paralyzed 17-year-old Anne Marie Hochhalter as she tried to flee. Klebold came out of the cafeteria and went back up the stairs to join Harris. They each shot once at students standing close to a soccer field but did not hit anyone. They walked toward the west entrance, throwing pipe bombs in several directions, including onto the roof; only a few of these pipe bombs detonated. Witnesses heard one of them say, &quot;This is what we always wanted to do. This is awesome!&quot;

Meanwhile, art teacher Patti Nielson was inside the school; she had noticed the commotion and walked toward the west entrance with student Brian Anderson. Nielson had intended to walk outside to tell the two students, &quot;Knock it off&quot;, thinking they were either filming a video or pulling a student prank. As Anderson opened the first set of double doors, the gunmen shot out the windows, injuring him with flying glass; Nielson was hit in the shoulder with shrapnel. Anderson and Nielson ran back down the hall into the library, and Nielson alerted the students inside to the danger, telling them to get under desks and keep silent. She dialed 9-1-1 and hid under the library&#x27;s administrative counter. Anderson fell to the floor, bleeding from his injuries, then hid inside the magazine room adjacent to the library.

===11:22¬†a.m.: Police response and West Entrance shootouts===
At 11:22¬†a.m., a custodian called Deputy Neil Gardner, the assigned resource officer to Columbine, on the school radio, requesting assistance in the senior parking lot. The only paved route took him around the school to the east and south on Pierce Street, where at 11:23¬†a.m., he heard on his police radio that a female was down, and assumed she had been struck by a car. While exiting his patrol car in the senior lot at 11:24, he heard another call on the school radio, &quot;Neil, there&#x27;s a shooter in the school.&quot;

Harris, at the west entrance, immediately turned and fired ten shots from his carbine at Gardner, who was away. As Harris reloaded his carbine, Gardner leaned over the top of his car and fired four rounds at Harris from his service pistol. Harris ducked back behind the building, and Gardner momentarily believed that he had hit him. Harris then reemerged and fired at least four more rounds at Gardner (which missed and struck two parked cars), before retreating into the building. No one was hit during the exchange of gunfire. Gardner reported on his police radio, &quot;Shots in the building. I need someone in the south lot with me.&quot; By this point, Harris had shot 47 times, and Klebold 5. The shooters then entered the school through the west entrance, moving along the main north hallway, throwing pipe bombs and shooting at anyone they encountered. Klebold shot Stephanie Munson in the ankle, but she was able to walk out of the school. The pair then shot out the windows to the east entrance of the school. After proceeding through the hall several times and shooting toward‚Äîand missing‚Äîany students they saw, they went toward the west entrance and turned into the library hallway.

Deputies Paul Smoker and Paul Magor, motorcycle patrolmen for the Jefferson County Sheriff&#x27;s Office, were writing a traffic ticket north of the school when the &quot;female down&quot; call came in at 11:23¬†a.m. Taking the shortest route, they drove their motorcycles over grass between the athletic fields and headed toward the west entrance. When they saw Deputies Scott Taborsky, Rick Searle, and Kevin Walker following them in their patrol car, they abandoned their motorcycles for the safety of the car. The six deputies had begun to rescue two wounded students near the ball fields when another gunfight broke out at 11:26, as Harris returned to the double doors and again began shooting at Deputy Gardner, who returned fire. From the hilltop, Deputy Smoker fired three rounds from his pistol at Harris, who again retreated into the building. As before, no one was hit.

Inside the school cafeteria, Dave Sanders and two custodians, Jon Curtis and Jay Gallatine, initially told students to get under the tables, then successfully evacuated students up the staircase leading to the second floor of the school. The stairs were located around the corner from the library hallway in the main south hallway. Sanders then tried to secure as much of the school as he could. Sanders and another student were at the end of the hallway, where he gestured for students in the library to stay, before encountering Harris and Klebold, who were approaching from the corner of the north hallway. Sanders and the student turned and ran in the opposite direction. Harris and Klebold shot at them both, with Harris hitting Sanders twice in the back and neck, hitting his teeth on exit, but missing the student. The latter ran into a science classroom and warned everyone to hide. Klebold walked over towards Sanders, who had collapsed, and tossed a pipe bomb, then returned to Harris up the library hallway.

Sanders struggled toward the science area, and teacher Rich Long took him into a classroom where 30 students were located. Due to his knowledge of first aid, student Aaron Hancey was brought to the classroom from another by teacher Kent Friesen despite the unfolding commotion. With the assistance of fellow student Kevin Starkey and teacher Theresa Miller, Hancey administered first aid to Sanders for three hours, attempting to stem the blood loss using shirts from students in the room, and showing him pictures from his wallet to keep him talking. Using a phone in the room, Miller and several students maintained contact with police outside the school.

As the shooting unfolded, pipe bombs were tossed in the hallways and down into the cafeteria. Patti Nielson in the library called 9-1-1, telling her story and urging students in the library to take cover beneath desks. According to transcripts, her call was received by a 9‚Äì1‚Äì1 operator at 11:25:18¬†a.m.
===11:29‚Äì11:36¬†a.m.: Library massacre===
At 11:29¬†a.m., Harris and Klebold entered the library. Fifty-two students, two teachers and two librarians were inside.

Harris fired his shotgun twice at a desk. Student Evan Todd had been standing near a pillar when the shooters entered the library and had just taken cover behind a photocopier. Todd was hit by wood splinters in the eye and lower back but was not seriously injured. He then hid behind the administrative counter.

The gunmen walked into the library, towards the two rows of computers. Sitting at the north row was disabled student Kyle Velasquez. Klebold fired his shotgun, fatally hitting him in the head and back. They put down their ammunition-filled duffel bags at the south‚Äîor lower‚Äîrow of computers and reloaded their weapons. They then walked between the computer rows, toward the windows facing the outside staircase.

Throughout the massacre in the library, they ordered everybody to get up, said how long they had been waiting for this, and seemed to be enjoying themselves, shouting things like &quot;Woo!&quot; after shooting. While ordering the jocks to stand up, one of the two said, &quot;Anybody with a white hat or a sports emblem on it is dead.&quot; Wearing a white baseball cap at Columbine was a tradition among sports team members. Nobody stood up, and several students tried to hide their white hats.

Windows were shot out in the direction of the recently arrived police. Officers returned fire, and the gunmen retreated from the windows; no one was injured. Klebold removed his trench coat. He then fired his shotgun at a nearby table, injuring three students: Patrick Ireland, Daniel Steepleton, and Makai Hall.

Harris walked toward the lower row of computer desks with his shotgun and fired a single shot under the first desk while down on one knee. He hit 14-year-old Steven Curnow with a mortal wound to the neck. He then moved to the adjacent computer desk, injuring 17-year-old Kacey Ruegsegger with a shot which passed completely through her right shoulder, also grazing her neck and severing a major artery. When she started gasping in pain, Harris said, &quot;Quit your bitching.&quot;

Harris then walked to a table south of the lower computer table, with two students underneath: Cassie Bernall and Emily Wyant. Harris slapped the surface of the table twice as he knelt, and said &quot;Peek-a-boo&quot; before shooting Bernall once in the head with the shotgun, killing her. Harris at this point held the gun with one hand, and the weapon hit his face in recoil, injuring his nose. He told Klebold he had done so, and Klebold responded &quot;Why&#x27;d you do that?&quot;

After fatally shooting Bernall, Harris turned toward the next table, where Bree Pasquale sat next to the table rather than under it. Harris&#x27;s nose was bleeding; witnesses later reported that he had blood around his mouth. Harris asked Pasquale if she wanted to die, and she responded with a plea for her life. Harris laughed and responded &quot;Everyone&#x27;s gonna die.&quot; When Klebold said &quot;shoot her,&quot; Harris responded &quot;No, we&#x27;re gonna blow up the school anyway.&quot;

Klebold noticed Ireland trying to provide aid to Hall, who had suffered a wound to his knee. As Ireland tried to help Hall, his head rose above the table. Klebold shot him a second time, hitting him twice in the head and once in the foot. Ireland was knocked unconscious but survived. Klebold then walked toward another table, where he discovered 18-year-old Isaiah Shoels, 16-year-old Matthew Kechter, and 16-year-old Craig Scott (Rachel&#x27;s younger brother), hiding underneath. Klebold called out to Harris that he found a &quot;nigger&quot; and tried to pull Shoels out from under the table.

Harris left Pasquale and joined him. According to witnesses, they taunted Shoels for a few seconds, making derogatory racial comments. The gunmen both fired under the table; Harris shot Shoels once in the chest, killing him, and Klebold shot and killed Kechter. Though Shoels was not shot in the head, Klebold said: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know black brains could fly that far.&quot;
Meanwhile, Scott was uninjured, lying in the blood of his friends, feigning death. Harris then yelled, &quot;Who&#x27;s ready to die next?!&quot;

He turned and threw a &quot;cricket&quot; at the table where Hall, Steepleton, and Ireland were located. It landed on Steepleton&#x27;s thigh; Hall quickly noticed it and tossed it behind them, and it exploded in mid-air. Harris walked toward the bookcases between the west and center section of tables in the library. He jumped on one and shook it, apparently attempting to topple it, then shot at the books which had fallen.

Klebold walked to the east area of the library. Harris walked from the bookcase, past the central area to meet Klebold. The latter shot at a display case next to the door, then turned and shot toward the closest table, hitting and injuring 17-year-old Mark Kintgen in the head and shoulder. He then turned toward the table to his left and fired, injuring 18-year-olds Lisa Kreutz, Lauren Townsend, and Valeen Schnurr with the same shotgun blast. Klebold then moved toward the same table and fired several shots with the TEC-9, killing Townsend.

At this point, the seriously injured Valeen Schnurr began screaming, &quot;Oh, my God! Oh, my God!&quot; In response, Klebold asked Schnurr if she believed in the existence of God; when Schnurr replied she did, Klebold asked &quot;Why?&quot; and commented &quot;God is gay.&quot; Klebold reloaded but walked away from the table.

Harris approached another table where two girls were hiding. He bent down to look at them and dismissed them as &quot;pathetic&quot;. Harris then moved to another table where he fired twice, injuring 16-year-olds Nicole Nowlen and John Tomlin. Tomlin moved out from under the table. Klebold shot him repeatedly, killing him.

Harris then walked back over to the other side of the table where Townsend lay dead. Behind the table, a 16-year-old girl named Kelly Fleming had, like Bree Pasquale, sat next to the table rather than beneath it due to a lack of space. Harris shot Fleming with his shotgun, hitting her in the back and killing her. He shot at the table behind Fleming, hitting Townsend, who was already dead; Kreutz again; and wounding 18-year-old Jeanna Park. The shooters moved to the center of the library, where they reloaded their weapons at a table. Harris then pointed his carbine under a table, but the student he was aiming at moved out of the way. Harris turned his gun back on the student and told him to identify himself. It was John Savage, an acquaintance of Klebold&#x27;s. He asked Klebold what they were doing, to which he shrugged and answered, &quot;Oh, just killing people.&quot; Savage asked if they were going to kill him. However, because of the background noise, Klebold said, &quot;What?&quot; Savage asked again whether they were going to kill him. Klebold said no, and told him to run. Savage fled, escaping through the library&#x27;s main entrance and through the cafeteria.

After Savage left, Harris turned and fired his carbine at the table directly north of where he had been, hitting the ear and hand of 15-year-old Daniel Mauser. Mauser retaliated by either shoving a chair at Harris or grabbing at his leg; Harris fired again and hit Mauser in the center of the face at close range, killing him. Harris then moved south and fired three shots under another table, critically injuring two 17-year-olds, Jennifer Doyle and Austin Eubanks. Klebold then shot once, fatally wounding 17-year-old Corey DePooter, at 11:35. There were no further victims. They had killed 10 people in the library and wounded 12.

Klebold was quoted as saying they might start knifing people, though they never did. They headed towards the library&#x27;s main counter. Harris threw a Molotov cocktail toward the southwestern end of the library, but it failed to explode. They converged close to where Todd had moved after having been wounded. Klebold pulled the chair out from the desk, then he pointed his TEC-9 at Todd, who was wearing a white hat. Klebold asked if he was a jock, and when Todd said no, Klebold responded &quot;Well, that&#x27;s good. We don&#x27;t like jocks.&quot; Klebold then demanded to see his face; Todd partly lifted his hat so his face would remain obscured. When Klebold asked Todd to give him one reason why he should not kill him, Todd said: &quot;I don&#x27;t want trouble.&quot; Klebold responded back angrily &quot;Trouble? You don&#x27;t even know what fucking trouble is!&quot; Todd tried to correct himself: &quot;That&#x27;s not what I meant! I mean, I don&#x27;t have a problem with you guys. I never will and I never did.&quot; Klebold then told Harris he was going to let Todd live, but that Harris could kill him if he wanted.

Harris appeared to pay no attention and stated that he and Klebold should head to the cafeteria. Klebold fired into an open library staff break room, hitting a small television. While Harris was walking away, Klebold said, &quot;One more thing!&quot;, then picked up the chair beside the library counter under which Patti Nielson was hiding, and slammed the chair down on top of the computer terminal and library counter. Klebold joined Harris at the library entrance. The two walked out of the library at 11:36. Cautiously, fearing the shooters&#x27; return, 10 injured and 29 uninjured survivors began to evacuate the library through the north emergency exit door, which led to the sidewalk adjacent to the west entrance. Kacey Ruegsegger was evacuated from the library by Craig Scott. Had she not been evacuated at this point, Ruegsegger would likely have bled to death from her injuries. Patrick Ireland, unconscious, and Lisa Kreutz, unable to move, remained in the building. Patti Nielson crawled into the exterior break room, into which Klebold had earlier fired shots, and hid in a cupboard.

=== 12:08¬†p.m.: Suicides ===
After leaving the library, Harris and Klebold entered the science area, where they caused a fire in an empty storage closet. It was extinguished by a teacher who had hidden in an adjacent room. The gunmen then proceeded toward the south hallway, where they shot into an empty science room. At 11:44¬†a.m., they were captured on the school security cameras as they re-entered the cafeteria. The recording shows Harris crouching against the rail on the staircase and firing toward the propane bombs left in the cafeteria, in an unsuccessful attempt to detonate them. As Klebold approached the propane bomb and examined it, Harris took a drink from one of the cups left behind. Klebold lit a Molotov cocktail and threw it at the propane bomb. About a minute later, the gallon of fuel attached to the bomb ignited, causing a fire that was extinguished by the fire sprinklers a few minutes later. They left the cafeteria at 11:46.

After leaving the cafeteria, they returned to the main north and south hallways of the school and fired several shots into walls and ceilings as students and teachers hid in rooms. They walked through the south hallway into the main office before returning to the north hallway. At 11:56, they returned to the cafeteria, and briefly entered the school kitchen. They returned up the staircase and into the south hallway at 12:00¬†p.m.

They re-entered the library, which was empty of survivors except for the unconscious Ireland and the injured Kreutz. Once inside, at 12:02¬†p.m., police were shot at again through the library windows and returned fire. Nobody was injured in the exchange. By 12:05, all gunfire from the school had ceased. By 12:08¬†p.m., both gunmen had killed themselves. Harris sat down with his back to a bookshelf and fired his shotgun through the roof of his mouth; Klebold went down on his knees and shot himself in the left temple with his TEC-9. An article by &quot;The Rocky Mountain News&quot; stated that Patti Nielson overheard them shout &quot;One! Two! Three!&quot; in unison, just before a loud boom. Nielson later said that she had never spoken with either of the writers of the article.

In 2002, the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; published two post-mortem photos of Harris and Klebold in the library. Klebold&#x27;s gun was underneath his body and so unseen in the photo, leading to speculation that Harris shot Klebold before killing himself. However, some of Klebold&#x27;s blood was on Harris&#x27;s legs, suggesting that he had fallen onto Harris after Harris had already killed himself. Also, just before shooting himself, Klebold lit a Molotov cocktail on a nearby table, underneath which Patrick Ireland was lying, which caused the tabletop to momentarily catch fire. Underneath the scorched film of material was a piece of Harris&#x27;s brain matter, suggesting Harris had shot himself by this point.

==Crisis ends==

===SWAT response===
By 12:00¬†p.m., SWAT teams were stationed outside the school, and ambulances started taking the wounded to local hospitals. A call for additional ammunition for police officers in case of a shootout came at 12:20. Authorities reported pipe bombs by 1:00, and two SWAT teams entered the school at 1:09, moving from classroom to classroom, discovering hidden students and faculty. They entered at the end of the school opposite the library, hampered by old maps and unaware a new wing had recently been added. They were also hampered by the sound of the fire alarms.

===Leawood Elementary===
Meanwhile, families of students and staff were asked to gather at nearby Leawood Elementary School to await information. All students, teachers, and school employees were taken away, questioned, and offered medical care in small holding areas before being bussed to meet with their family members at Leawood Elementary. In his book &quot;Walking in Daniel&#x27;s Shoes&quot;, Tom Mauser, father of victim Daniel Mauser, recounts how several families who&#x27;d still been waiting on word of the status of their children were informed by law enforcement that another bus from the school was on its way. However, this bus never arrived, and whether the comments from police stemmed from miscommunication or were an attempt to give distraught parents hope is unknown.

===The boy in the window===
Patrick Ireland had regained and lost consciousness several times after being shot by Klebold. Paralyzed on his right side, he crawled to the library windows where, on live television, at 2:38¬†p.m., he stretched out the window, intending to fall into the arms of two SWAT team members standing on the roof of an emergency vehicle, but instead falling directly onto the vehicle&#x27;s roof in a pool of blood. He became known as &quot;the boy in the window.&quot; The team members, Donn Kraemer and John Ramoniec, were later criticized for allowing Ireland to drop more than seven feet to the ground while doing nothing to try to ensure he could be lowered to the ground safely or break his fall.

===&quot;1 bleeding to death&quot;===
At 2:15¬†p.m., students placed a sign in the window: &quot;1 bleeding to death&quot;, in order to alert police and medical personnel of Dave Sanders&#x27;s location in the science room. Police initially feared it was a ruse by the shooters. A shirt was also tied to the doorknob. At 2:30, this was spotted, and by 2:40, SWAT officers evacuated the room of students and called for a paramedic. Hancey and Starkey were reluctant to leave Sanders behind. By 3:00, the SWAT officers had moved Sanders to a storage room, which was more easily accessible. As they did so, a paramedic arrived and found Sanders had no pulse. He had died of his injuries in the storage room before he could receive medical care. He was the only teacher to die in the shooting.

=== Suicide mission; estimated 25 dead ===
Lisa Kreutz, shot in the shoulder, arms, hand, and thigh, remained lying in the library. She had tried to move but became light-headed. Kreutz kept track of time by the sound of the school&#x27;s bells until police arrived. Kreutz was finally evacuated at 3:22¬†p.m., along with Patti Nielson, Brian Anderson, and the three library staff who had hidden in the rooms adjacent to the library. Officials found the bodies in the library by 3:30.
By 4:00, Sheriff John P. Stone made an initial estimate of 25 dead students and teachers, fifty wounded, and referred to the massacre as a &quot;suicide mission&quot;. President Bill Clinton later issued a statement.

=== Bomb squad response ===
Stone said that police officers were searching the bodies of the gunmen. They feared they had used their pipe bombs to booby-trap corpses, including their own. At 4:30¬†p.m., the school was declared safe. At 5:30, additional officers were called in, as more explosives were found in the parking lot and on the roof. By 6:15, officials had found a bomb in Klebold&#x27;s car in the parking lot, set to detonate the gas tank. Stone then marked the entire school as a crime scene.

At 10:40¬†p.m., a member of the bomb squad, who was attempting to dispose of an un-detonated pipe bomb, accidentally lit a striking match attached to the bomb by brushing it against the wall of the ordnance disposal trailer. The bomb detonated inside the trailer but no one was injured.

The bomb squad disarmed the car bomb. Klebold&#x27;s car was repaired and, in 2006, put up for auction.

==Immediate aftermath==

On the morning of April 21, bomb squads combed the high school. By 8:30¬†a.m., the official death toll of 15 was released. The earlier estimate was ten over the true death toll count, but close to the total count of wounded students. The total count of deaths was 12 students (14 including the shooters) and one teacher; 20 students and one teacher were injured as a result of the shootings. Three more victims were injured indirectly as they tried to escape the school.

At 10:00¬†a.m., the bomb squad declared the building safe for officials to enter. By 11:30¬†a.m., a spokesman of the sheriff declared the investigation underway. Thirteen of the bodies were still inside the high school as investigators photographed the building.

At 2:30¬†p.m., a press conference was held by Jefferson County District Attorney David Thomas and Sheriff John Stone, at which they said that they suspected others had helped plan the shooting. Formal identification of the dead had not yet taken place, but families of the children thought to have been killed had been notified.

Throughout the late afternoon and early evening, the bodies were gradually removed from the school and taken to the Jefferson County Coroner&#x27;s Office to be identified and autopsied. By 5:00¬†p.m., the names of many of the dead were known. An official statement was released, naming the 15 confirmed deaths and 27 injuries related to the massacre.

On April 22, the cafeteria bombs were discovered.

In the days following the shootings, Rachel Scott&#x27;s car and John Tomlin&#x27;s truck became memorials, and impromptu memorials were held in Clement Park. On April 30, carpenter Greg Zanis erected fifteen 6-foot-tall wooden crosses to honor those who had died at the school. Daniel Rohrbough&#x27;s father cut down the two meant for the gunmen. There were also fifteen trees planted, and he cut down two of those as well.

In November 2021, a report was leaked to NPR about that year&#x27;s National Rifle Association convention in Denver. In a series of audio tapes, Wayne LaPierre and other top officials suggested raising one million dollars for the victims&#x27; families, and the cancellation of the convention was considered by some within the organization.

=== Search warrant press conference ===
Also on April 30, high-ranking officials of Jefferson County and the Jefferson County Sheriff&#x27;s Office met to decide if they should reveal that Michael Guerra had drafted an affidavit for a search warrant of Harris&#x27;s residence more than a year before the shootings, based on his previous investigation of Harris&#x27;s website and activities. Since the affidavit&#x27;s contents lacked the necessary probable cause, they decided not to disclose this information at a press conference held on April 30, nor did they mention it in any other way.

Over the next two years, Guerra&#x27;s original draft and investigative file documents were lost. In September 1999, a Jefferson County investigator failed to find the documents during a secret search of the county&#x27;s computer system. A second attempt in late 2000 found copies of the document within the Jefferson County archives. Their loss was termed &quot;troubling&quot; by a grand jury convened after the file&#x27;s existence was reported in April 2001. It was concealed by the Jefferson County Sheriff&#x27;s Office and not revealed until September 2001, resulting from an investigation by the TV show &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. The documents were reconstructed and released to the public, but the original documents are still missing. The final grand jury investigation was released in September 2004.

=== Christian martyrdom ===
In the wake of the shooting, victims Rachel Scott and Cassie Bernall came to be regarded as Christian martyrs by Evangelical Christians.

The closest living witness to Scott&#x27;s death, Richard Castaldo, has stated Harris asked Scott if she believed in God, and murdered her after she answered &quot;You know I do&quot;, but this has been questioned, and Castaldo later stated he was not sure.
Considerable media attention focused upon Bernall, who had been killed by Harris in the library and who Harris was reported to have asked, &quot;Do you believe in God?&quot; immediately prior to her murder. Bernall was reported to have responded &quot;Yes&quot; to this question before her murder. Emily Wyant, the closest living witness to Bernall&#x27;s death, denied that Bernall and Harris had such an exchange. Joshua Lapp thought Bernall had been queried about her belief, but he was unable to correctly point out where Bernall was located, and was closer to survivor Valeen Schnurr during the shootings. Likewise, another witness, Craig Scott, claimed the discussion was with Bernall. However, when asked to indicate where the conversation had been coming from, he pointed to where Schnurr was shot. Schnurr herself claims that she was the one questioned as to her belief in God.

=== We are Columbine ===
Classes at Columbine were held at nearby Chatfield Senior High for the remaining three weeks of the 1999 school year. In August 1999, students returned to the school, and principal Frank DeAngelis led a rally of students clad in &quot;We are Columbine&quot; shirts.

=== Secondary casualties ===
Six months after the shootings, Anne Marie Hochhalter&#x27;s mother killed herself. Hochhalter died on February 16, 2025, potentially due to medical complications from the paralysis and injuries sustained during the shooting. Several former students and teachers had PTSD. 

Greg Barnes, a 17-year-old student who had witnessed Sanders&#x27;s shooting, died by suicide in May 2000. Survivor Austin Eubanks, who was injured during the shooting, became heavily medicated, developing an opioid addiction. He eventually overcame and later spoke publicly about the addiction, but died from an accidental overdose in 2019 at the age of 37.

=== Conspiracy theories and misinformation ===
In the immediate aftermath, conspiracy theories and unfounded claims were made by several anti-government movements and extremist religious and political movements, such as the Westboro Baptist Church and televangelist Jerry Falwell Sr.

Westboro&#x27;s founder and then-leader, Fred Phelps, unfoundedly claimed that both Harris and Klebold were gay, saying: &quot;Two filthy fags slaughtered 13 people at Columbine High.&quot; Falwell also claimed that Harris and Klebold were gay, though he retracted afterward.

Conspiracy theories also arose from anti-gun control activists and extremists, claiming that the massacre had either been staged or that both Harris and Klebold had been government agents, aiming at promoting tougher gun control legislation. Other conspiracy theories point to a mysterious third shooter that has never been identified.

Other antisemitic conspiracy theories pointed to the massacre being a Jewish conspiracy, due to Klebold&#x27;s mother being Jewish.

Political commentator and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones once implied that the U.S. government had &quot;perpetrated&quot; Columbine, and has claimed that &quot;the Columbine school shootings were 100 percent false flag&quot;.

==Motive==
The shooting was planned as a terrorist attack that would cause &quot;the most deaths in U.S. history&quot;, but the motive has never been ascertained with any degree of certainty. In a letter provided with the May 15 report on the Columbine attack, Sheriff John Stone and Undersheriff John A. Dunaway wrote they &quot;cannot answer the most fundamental question‚Äîwhy?&quot; In the days following the event, media speculation regarding the killers&#x27; motive was rife. Media reports were disseminated suggesting various motives of the killers, although all theories were largely unsubstantiated and turned out to be myths. These reports included blaming bullying, goth culture, video games, Marilyn Manson, and targeting jocks and minorities. Other rumors were spread in the local area but not largely disseminated by the media, such as the false claim spread by some students that the killers were bullied because they were homosexual.

=== Mental disorder ===

==== The FBI&#x27;s theory ====
The FBI concluded that the killers had mental illnesses, that Harris was a clinical psychopath, and Klebold had depression. Dwayne Fuselier, the supervisor in charge of the Columbine investigation, would later remark: &quot;I believe Eric went to the school to kill and didn&#x27;t care if he died, while Dylan wanted to die and didn&#x27;t care if others died as well.&quot;

In April 1998, a year prior to the shooting, as part of his diversion program, Harris wrote a letter of apology to the owner of the van he and Klebold broke into earlier that year. Around the same time, he derided the owner of the van in his journal, stating that he believed he had the right to steal something if he wanted to. By far the most prevalent theme in Klebold&#x27;s journals is his wish for suicide and private despair at his lack of success with women, which he refers to as an &quot;infinite sadness&quot;. Klebold had repeatedly documented his desires to kill himself, and his final remark in the Basement Tapes, shortly before the attack, is a resigned statement made as he glances away from the camera: &quot;Just know I&#x27;m going to a better place. I didn&#x27;t like life too much.&quot;

The FBI&#x27;s theory was used by Dave Cullen for his 2009 book &quot;Columbine&quot;. Harris was depicted as the mastermind, having a messianic-level superiority complex and hoping to demonstrate his superiority to the world. Klebold was a follower who primarily participated in the massacre as a means to simply end his life.

This theory has been met with criticism. Critics cite the fact that Klebold, not Harris, was the first to mention a killing spree in his journal. They also cite evidence that Harris was depressed as well, such as his prescription for antidepressants mentioned below.

==== Medication ====
Opponents of contemporary psychiatry like Peter Breggin claim that the psychiatric medications prescribed to Harris may have exacerbated his aggressiveness.
Harris had complained of depression, anger, and suicidal thoughts, for which he was prescribed antidepressants.¬†Toxicology reports confirmed that Harris had Luvox in his bloodstream at the time of the shootings, whereas Klebold had no medications in his system.
Harris continued his scheduled meetings with his psychologist until a few months before the massacre.

==== Other theories ====
There have been other attempts to diagnose Harris and Klebold with mental illness. Peter Langman believes Harris was a psychopath and Klebold was schizotypal. Professor Aubrey Immelman published a personality profile of Harris, based on journal entries and personal communication, and believes the materials suggested behavior patterns consistent with a &quot;malignant narcissism...pathological narcissistic personality disorder with borderline and antisocial features, along with some paranoid traits, and unconstrained aggression.&quot;

=== Media speculation ===
====Bullying====
Early stories following the massacre charged that school administrators and teachers at Columbine had long condoned bullying by jocks and this explained the motive. The link between bullying and school violence has attracted increasing attention since.

Accounts from various parents and school staffers reported bullying in the school. Reportedly, Harris and Klebold were regularly called &quot;faggots&quot;. Klebold said on the Basement Tapes, &quot;You&#x27;ve been giving us shit for years;&quot; however, they also stated several times on the tapes and in the journals that no one else was to blame, nor could have prevented the attack. Dylan when talking to his father about the jocks had stated, &quot;They sure give Eric hell.&quot; but he also said that the jocks tended to leave him [Dylan] alone. Brown also noted Harris was born with mild chest indent. This made him reluctant to take his shirt off in gym class, and other students would laugh at him. Nathan Vanderau, a friend of Klebold, and Alisa Owen, who knew Harris, noted they were picked on. Vanderau recalled that a &quot;cup of fecal matter&quot; was thrown at them.

It has been alleged that Harris and Klebold were once both confronted by a group of students at CHS who sprayed them with ketchup while referring to them as &quot;faggots&quot; and &quot;queers&quot;. Klebold told his mother it had been the worst day of his life. According to Brown, &quot;That happened while teachers watched. They couldn&#x27;t fight back. They wore the ketchup all day and went home covered with it.&quot; According to classmate Chad Laughlin, it involved seniors pelting Klebold with &quot;ketchup-covered tampons&quot; in the commons. Laughlin also stated, &quot;A lot of the tension in the school came from the class above us...There were people fearful of walking by a table where you knew you didn&#x27;t belong, stuff like that. Certain groups certainly got preferential treatment across the board.&quot;

A similar theory was expounded by Brooks Brown in his book on the massacre, &quot;No Easy Answers&quot;; he noted that teachers commonly ignored bullying and that when Harris and Klebold were bullied by the jocks at CHS, they would make statements such as: &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, man. It happens all the time!&quot;

Cullen, as well as psychologists dispute the theory of &quot;revenge for bullying&quot; as a motivation. While acknowledging the pervasiveness of bullying in high schools including CHS, Cullen claimed they were not victims of bullying. He noted Harris was more often the perpetrator than victim of bullying. In an entry by Eric Harris in his journal, he stated that even if he were complimented and respected more by his peers, the attack would have still, in all likelihood, occurred. In another entry by Eric in his journal he says not to blame the school&#x27;s administration for the attack as the staff is doing a good job running the school. In a fact check published on April 19, 2019, on the eve of the commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the massacre, Gillian Brockell in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; underscored that, contrary to the popular view, their attack was not revenge for being bullied. Author Jeff Kass who has also published a book on the attack believes that bullying wasn&#x27;t the cause. Peter Langman also argues against bullying being the cause of the attack. Other researchers have also argued against the bullying hypothesis.

==== Isolation ====
Rejection was also highlighted as a cause. Social cliques within high schools such as the Trench Coat Mafia were widely discussed. One perception formed was that Harris and Klebold were both outcasts who had been isolated from their classmates, prompting feelings of helplessness, insecurity, and depression, as well as a strong need for power and attention. Harris&#x27;s last journal entry reads, &quot;I hate you people for leaving me out of so many fun things&quot;, while Klebold wrote &quot;The lonely man strikes with absolute rage.&quot; In an interview, Brown described them as the school&#x27;s worst outcasts, &quot;the losers of the losers&quot;.

This concept too has been questioned, as both Harris and Klebold had a close circle of friends and a wider informal social group. Cullen and Brockell both also say they were not in the Trench Coat Mafia and were not isolated outcasts or loners. Other close friends of the pair such as Chad Laughlin and Nathan Dykeman state the duo were not outcasts. Peter Langman also concurs by also arguing against the pair being loners and outcasts.

====Political terrorism====
Some peers, such as Robyn Anderson, stated that the pair were not interested in Nazism, and they did not worship or admire Hitler in any way. However, in retrospect, Anderson also stated that there were many things the pair did not tell friends. Harris at least did revere the Nazis, often praising them in his journal.
While some sources claim that there is a connection to Hitler&#x27;s birthday (20 April 1889), the theory is dismissed by others since the date of the attack had been delayed due to a munitions problem.

Sociologist Ralph Larkin has theorized that the massacre was to trigger a revolution of outcast students and the dispossessed: &quot;[A]s an overtly political act in the name of oppressed students victimized by their peers. [...] The Columbine shootings redefined such acts not merely as revenge but as a means of protest of bullying, intimidation, social isolation, and public rituals of humiliation.&quot;

In contrast with the theory that attack was political, one author argues Columbine was only increasingly linked to terrorism after the September 11 attacks.

====Marilyn Manson====

In the late 1990s, Marilyn Manson and his band established themselves as a household name, and as one of the most controversial rock acts in music history. Their two album releases prior to the massacre were both critical and commercial successes, and by the time of their Rock Is Dead Tour in 1999, the frontman had become a culture war iconoclast and a rallying icon for alienated youth.

Immediately after the massacre, a significant portion of blame was directed at the band and, specifically, at its outspoken frontman. In the weeks following the shootings, media reports about Harris and Klebold portrayed them and the Trench Coat Mafia as part of a gothic cult. Early media reports alleged that the shooters were fans, and were wearing the group&#x27;s T-shirts during the massacre. Although these claims were later proven to be false, news outlets continued to run sensationalist stories with headlines such as &quot;Killers Worshipped Rock Freak Manson&quot; and &quot;Devil-Worshipping Maniac Told Kids To Kill&quot;. Speculation in national media and among the public led many to believe that Manson&#x27;s music and imagery were the shooter&#x27;s sole motivation, despite reports that revealed that the two were not big fans.

Despite this, Marilyn Manson were widely criticized by religious, political, and entertainment-industry figures. Under mounting pressure in the days after Columbine, the group postponed their last five North American tour dates out of respect for the victims and their families. Manson published his response to these accusations in an op-ed piece for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, titled &quot;Columbine: Whose Fault Is It?&quot;, in which he castigated America&#x27;s gun culture, the political influence of the National Rifle Association, and the media&#x27;s irresponsible coverage, which he said facilitated the placing of blame on a scapegoat.
After concluding the European and Japanese legs of their tour on August 8, the band withdrew from public view to work on their next album, 2000&#x27;s &quot;Holy Wood (In the Shadow of the Valley of Death)&quot; as an artistic rebuttal to the allegations leveled against them.

===Video games===

Violent video games were also blamed. Parents of some of the victims filed several unsuccessful lawsuits against video game manufacturers. Jerald Block believes their immersion in a virtual world best explains the massacre. While Brooks Brown disagrees that video games caused the massacre, he agrees elements of their plan came from video games.

Harris and Klebold were both fans of shooter video games such as &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;Quake&quot;, &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; and &quot;Postal&quot;. A file on Harris&#x27;s computer read the massacre will &quot;be like the LA riots, the Oklahoma bombing, WWII, Vietnam, &quot;Duke&quot; and &quot;Doom&quot; all mixed together.&quot; In his last journal entry, Harris wished to &quot;Get a few extra frags on the scoreboard.&quot; After the massacre, it was alleged Harris created &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot; levels resembling CHS, but these were never found.

====&quot;Doom&quot;====

They were avid fans of &quot;Doom&quot; especially. Harris said of the massacre, &quot;It&#x27;s going to be like...&quot;Doom&quot;.&quot; He also wrote &quot;I must not be sidetracked by my feelings of sympathy...so I will force myself to believe that everyone is just another monster from &quot;Doom&quot;.&quot; In Harris&#x27;s yearbook, Klebold wrote &quot;I find a similarity between people and &quot;Doom&quot; zombies.&quot; Harris named his shotgun Arlene after a character in the &quot;Doom&quot; novels. The TEC-9 Klebold used resembled an AB-10, a weapon from the &quot;Doom&quot; novels that Harris referenced several times.

Harris spent a great deal of time creating a large WAD, named Tier (German for &#x27;animal&#x27;, and a song by Rammstein), calling it his &quot;life&#x27;s work&quot;. The WAD was uploaded to the Columbine school computer and to AOL shortly before the attack, but appears to have been lost.

====&quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;====
The other game mentioned specifically by Harris for what the massacre would be like was &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;. The game has pipe bombs and one of the enemies is the &quot;pig cop&quot;. Brooks Brown wrote that pipe bombs were set in the halls of the school with the intention of causing a chain reaction, because that&#x27;s what happens in &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;. Brown also wrote they shot wildly because it works in &quot;Duke Nukem 3D&quot;.

==Legacy==
Following the Columbine shooting, schools across the United States instituted new security measures such as see-through backpacks, metal detectors, school uniforms, and security guards. Some schools implemented the numbering of school doors in order to improve public safety response. Several schools throughout the country resorted to requiring students to wear computer-generated IDs.

Schools also adopted a zero tolerance approach to possession of weapons and threatening behavior by students.
Despite the effort, several social science experts feel the zero tolerance approach adopted in schools has been implemented too harshly, with unintended consequences creating other problems. Despite the safety measures that were implemented in the wake of the tragedy at Columbine, school shootings continued to take place in the United States, including at Virginia Tech, Sandy Hook Elementary School, Stoneman Douglas High School, and Robb Elementary School.

Some schools renewed existing anti-bullying policies. Rachel&#x27;s Challenge was started by Rachel Scott&#x27;s parents, and lectures schools about bullying and suicide.

In 2000, Sanders was posthumously given the Arthur Ashe Courage Award for his actions.

===Police tactics===
Police departments reassessed their tactics and now train for Columbine-like situations after criticism over the slow response and progress of the SWAT teams during the shooting.

Police followed a traditional tactic at Columbine: surround the building, set up a perimeter, and contain the damage. That approach has been replaced by a tactic known as the Immediate Action Rapid Deployment tactic. This tactic calls for a four-person team to advance into the site of any ongoing shooting, optimally a diamond-shaped wedge, but even with just a single officer if more are not available. Police officers using this tactic are trained to move toward the sound of gunfire and neutralize the shooter as quickly as possible. Their goal is to stop the shooter at all costs; they are to walk past wounded victims, as the aim is to prevent the shooter from killing or wounding more. Dave Cullen has stated: &quot;The active protocol has proved successful at numerous shootings... At Virginia Tech alone, it probably saved dozens of lives.&quot;
===Lawsuits===
After the massacre, many survivors and relatives of deceased victims filed lawsuits. Under Colorado state law at the time, the maximum a family could receive in a lawsuit against a government agency was $600,000 (). Most cases against the Jefferson County Sheriff&#x27;s Office and school district were dismissed by the federal court on the grounds of government immunity. The case against the sheriff&#x27;s office regarding the death of Dave Sanders was not dismissed due to the police preventing paramedics from going to his aid for hours after they knew the gunmen were dead. The case was settled out of court in August 2002 for $1,500,000.

In April 2001, the families of more than 30 victims received a $2,538,000 settlement in their case against the families of Harris, Klebold, Manes, and Duran. Under the terms of the settlement, the Harrises and the Klebolds contributed $1,568,000 through their homeowners&#x27; policies, with another $32,000 set aside for future claims; the Manes contributed $720,000, with another $80,000 set aside for future claims; and the Durans contributed $250,000, with an additional $50,000 available for future claims. The family of victim Shoels rejected this settlement, but in June 2003 were ordered by a judge to accept a $366,000 settlement in their $250-million lawsuit against the shooters&#x27; families. In August 2003, the families of victims Fleming, Kechter, Rohrbough, Townsend, and Velasquez received undisclosed settlements in a wrongful death suit against the Harrises and Klebolds.

Parents of some of the victims filed several unsuccessful lawsuits against film companies, over films such as &quot;The Basketball Diaries&quot;, which includes a dream sequence with a student shooting his classmates in a trench coat. In the Basement Tapes, they debate on whether or not Steven Spielberg or Quentin Tarantino are appropriate choices to direct films about the massacre. Their home videos also show inspiration taken from &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;. Both were fans of the film &quot;Lost Highway&quot;. &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; was found in Harris&#x27;s VCR.

===Memorials===
Many impromptu memorials were created after the massacre, including victims Rachel Scott&#x27;s car and John Tomlin&#x27;s truck.

In 2000, youth advocate Melissa Helmbrecht organized a remembrance event in Denver featuring two surviving students, called &quot;A Call to Hope&quot;. The library where most of the massacre took place was removed and replaced with an atrium. In 2001, a new library, the HOPE memorial library, was built next to the west entrance.

On February 26, 2004, thousands of pieces of evidence from the massacre were put on display at the Jefferson County fairgrounds in Golden.

A permanent memorial &quot;to honor and remember the victims of the April 20, 1999, shootings at Columbine High School&quot; began planning in June 1999, and was dedicated on September 21, 2007, in Clement Park. The memorial fund raised $1.5¬†million in donations over eight years of planning. Designing took three and a half years and included feedback from victims&#x27; families, survivors, the high school&#x27;s students and staff, and the community.

Soon after the massacre, music students at CU Boulder raised money to commission a piece of music to honor Columbine. The university band turned to Frank Ticheli, who responded by composing the wind ensemble work &quot;An American Elegy&quot;. The following year, the Columbine band premiered the piece at CU Boulder&#x27;s concert hall. , Ticheli&#x27;s sheet music publisher estimates &quot;An American Elegy&quot; has been performed 10,000 times.

===Gun control===
The shooting resulted in calls for more gun control measures. The gun show loophole and background checks became a focus of a national debate. It was the deadliest mass shooting during the era of the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. Victim Daniel Mauser&#x27;s father Tom Mauser has become a gun control advocate.

In 2000, federal and state legislation was introduced that would require safety locks on firearms as well as ban the importation of high-capacity ammunition magazines. Though laws were passed that made it a crime to buy guns for criminals and minors, there was considerable controversy over legislation pertaining to background checks at gun shows. There was concern in the gun lobby over restrictions on Second Amendment rights in the United States. Frank Lautenberg introduced a proposal to close the gun show loophole in federal law. It was passed in the Senate, but did not pass in the House.

Michael Moore&#x27;s 2002 documentary &quot;Bowling for Columbine&quot; focused heavily on the American obsession with handguns, its grip on Jefferson County, and its role in the shooting.

In 2019, the MyLastShot Project was launched as a student-led gun violence prevention resource. The campaign was created by students from Columbine High School, and involves students placing stickers on their driver&#x27;s licenses, student IDs, or phones that states their wishes to have the graphic photos of their bodies publicized if they die in a shooting.

===Popular culture===

&quot;Columbine&quot; has since become a euphemism for a school shooting, similar to how &quot;going postal&quot; is for workplace violence.

Since the advent of social media, a fandom for shooters Harris and Klebold has had a documented presence on social media sites, especially Tumblr. Fans of Harris and Klebold refer to themselves as &quot;Columbiners&quot;. An article published in 2015 in the &quot;Journal of Transformative Works&quot;, a scholarly journal which focuses on the sociology of fandoms, noted that Columbiners were not fundamentally functionally different from more mainstream fandoms. Columbiners create fan art and fan fiction, even cosplaying the pair, and have a scholarly interest in the shooting.

A number of books, movies and other media have been inspired by this event. Among those are several video games. A video game called &quot;Super Columbine Massacre RPG!&quot; was based on the massacre. The Flash game &quot;Pico&#x27;s School&quot; was also inspired by it.

===Copycats===
The Columbine shootings influenced subsequent school shootings, with several such plots mentioning it. Fear of copycats has sometimes led to the closing of entire school districts. Since Columbine, over 74 copycat cases have been reported, 21 of which resulted in attacks, while the rest were thwarted by law enforcement. In many of them, the perpetrators cited Harris and Klebold as heroes or martyrs.

==== Analysis ====
Harris and Klebold have become what the &quot;Napa Valley Register&quot; have called &quot;cultural icons&quot; for troubled youth. According to psychiatrist E. Fuller Torrey of the Treatment Advocacy Center, a legacy of the Columbine shootings is its &quot;allure to disaffected youth&quot;.

Sociologist Ralph Larkin examined twelve major school shootings in the US in the following eight years and found that in eight of those, &quot;the shooters made explicit reference to Harris and Klebold&quot;. Larkin wrote that the Columbine massacre established a &quot;script&quot; for shootings. &quot;Numerous post-Columbine rampage shooters referred directly to Columbine as their inspiration; others attempted to supersede the Columbine shootings in body count.&quot;

A 2015 investigation by CNN identified &quot;more than 40 people...charged with Columbine-style plots&quot;. A 2014 investigation by ABC News identified &quot;at least 17 attacks and another 36 alleged plots or serious threats against schools since the assault on Columbine High School that can be tied to the 1999 massacre.&quot; Ties identified by ABC News included online research by the perpetrators into the Columbine shooting, clipping news coverage and images of Columbine, explicit statements of admiration of Harris and Klebold, such as writings in journals and on social media, in video posts, and in police interviews, timing planned to an anniversary of Columbine, plans to exceed the Columbine victim counts, and other ties.

In 2015, journalist Malcolm Gladwell writing in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine proposed a threshold model of school shootings in which Harris and Klebold were the triggering actors in &quot;a slow-motion, ever-evolving riot, in which each new participant&#x27;s action makes sense in reaction to and in combination with those who came before.&quot;

In February 2016, after Klebold&#x27;s mother, Sue Klebold, surfaced to speak out on mental health and suicide prevention, she was condemned by then Attorney General of Colorado, Cynthia Coffman, who tweeted that Klebold had been &quot;irresponsible and inflammatory&quot; for her interview with Diane Sawyer. She also added on a follow-up tweet that Klebold had been &quot;selfish&quot; and that her interview could have &quot;very negative consequences&quot;. Coffman&#x27;s remarks were condemned by Ted Zocco-Hochhalter, whose daughter Anne-Marie Hochhalter was a Columbine student paralyzed in the attack. He said there was nothing wrong with Klebold coming up as a remorseful mother trying to spark awareness on mental issues. Other mental health organizations echoed Zocco-Hochhalter&#x27;s remarks. Zocco-Hochhalter&#x27;s daughter, Anne-Marie Hochhalter, forgave Sue Klebold.
