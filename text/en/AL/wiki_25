<text>Lake Teletskoye (; ) is the largest lake in the Altai Mountains and the Altai Republic, Russia, and has depth up to 325 meters.

Situated at a height of above the sea level, the lake is long and wide and lies between the mountain ridges Korbu and Al-tyntu, on the junction of the Sailughem Mountains and the Western Sayans. Its surface area is ; however, due to its considerable depth (), the lake contains no less than of fresh water. Annual water level fluctuations are estimated at some 348 sm. The lake transparency is high, with the visibility of the lake water ranging from six to fourteen meters.

About 70 rivers and 150 temporary streams flow into the lake, the largest of them, Chulyshman River, supplying more than half of the lake&#x27;s water. The lake is drained through a single outlet, the Biya River, which, after its confluence with the Katun River, forms one of Siberia&#x27;s largest rivers, the Ob River.

The lake is surrounded by mountains of 600–1,300 m in the northern part and about in the southern part. Lake Teletskoe is included into Altaisky Nature Reserve. That reserve along with the Katun Nature Reserve and the Ukok Plateau Nature Refuge were listed as one of UNESCO World Natural Heritage Sites under the name &quot;Golden Mountains of Altai&quot;.

The Altai people have a legend about the name of the lake in their language, which means Golden Lake. According to this story, once, a rich man had an ingot of gold, which he wanted to use to buy food. He travelled around Altai, but could not find anyone who would sell him any food. Eventually, he threw the gold into the lake. This legend is the origin of the name.

== Research ==
There is a field base of Institute of Taxonomy and Ecology of Animals () by the Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences () at the northwest part of the lake, about 6 km from head water of Biya River. Therein studies are performed of the insect-eaters and rodents of Altai Republic, helminthofauna of vertebrates in biocenoses of taiga, ichthyocenose and animal plankton of Lake Teletskoye. Near the base there is located the research-and-production sport-and-sanitary base of Gorno-Altaisk State University. Tomsk State University has been conducting scientific research in the area for more than 50 years. Ecologists, geologists, and archeologists from Institute of Water and Ecological Problems () the Siberian Division of the Russian Academy of Sciences from the Institute of Water and Ecological Problems spend many years working here to study the lake and surrounding area. Geomorphologists and geologists scrutinize geological structure of Lake Teletskoye, its paleogeography, age, and origin.

It has been known for a long time that there are gold in placers and bedrock deposits in the Altai. The Geomorphologists from Tomsk State University works in the Teletskoye geology-prospecting detachment searching for gold-placers. They managed to establish a new search criterion for a placer. The base for the discovery were the palaeoglaciological studies during the last few years and theoretical models of the diluvial morpholithogenesis. The content of the precious component is everywhere much higher than the lowest accepted industrial standard, sometimes it&#x27;s tremendous.

The investigators carried out large-scale exploration routes on vast territories near watersheds of the upper reaches of all the rivers in the northern and western parts of the Teletskoye Lake basin. These explorations included studies of exposures, boring of prospect-holes, and wells (up to 15 m deep). The results of these investigations let us speak about the regularity and reliability of the new criterion. The first 14C-method data for the layered clays on the flat watersheds showed the age of 15 thousand years and younger. This important fact leads to an unavoidable conclusion about the youth of the Teletskoje Lake depression – the post-glacial age of “the last cutting” during the pre-glacial (Late Quaternary) peneplain.

<text>Lewis Allan Reed (March 2, 1942October 27, 2013) was an American musician and songwriter. He was the guitarist, singer, and principal songwriter for the rock band The Velvet Underground and had a solo career that spanned five decades. Although not commercially successful during its existence, the Velvet Underground came to be regarded as one of the most influential bands in the history of underground and alternative rock music. Reed&#x27;s distinctive deadpan voice, poetic and transgressive lyrics, and experimental guitar playing were trademarks throughout his long career.

Having played guitar and sung in doo-wop groups in high school, Reed studied poetry at Syracuse University under Delmore Schwartz, and served as a radio DJ, hosting a late-night avant-garde music program while at college. After graduating from Syracuse, he went to work for Pickwick Records in New York City, a low-budget record company that specialized in sound-alike recordings, as a songwriter and session musician. A fellow session player at Pickwick was John Cale; together with Sterling Morrison and Angus MacLise, they would form the Velvet Underground in 1965. After building a reputation on the avant garde music scene, they gained the attention of Andy Warhol, who became the band&#x27;s manager; they in turn became something of a fixture at The Factory, Warhol&#x27;s art studio, and served as his &quot;house band&quot; for various projects. The band released their first album, now with drummer Moe Tucker and featuring German singer Nico, in 1967, and parted ways with Warhol shortly thereafter. Following several lineup changes and three more little-heard albums, Reed quit the band in 1970.

After leaving the band, Reed would go on to a much more commercially successful solo career, releasing twenty solo studio albums. His second, &quot;Transformer&quot; (1972), was produced by David Bowie and arranged by Mick Ronson, and brought him mainstream recognition. The album is considered an influential landmark of the glam rock genre, anchored by Reed&#x27;s most successful single, &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot;. After &quot;Transformer&quot;, the less commercial but critically acclaimed &quot;Berlin&quot; peaked at No. 7 on the UK Albums Chart. &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Animal&quot; (a live album released in 1974) sold strongly, and &quot;Sally Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; (1974) peaked at No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200; but for a long period after, Reed&#x27;s work did not translate into sales, leading him deeper into drug addiction and alcoholism. Reed cleaned up in the early 1980s, and gradually returned to prominence with &quot;The Blue Mask&quot; (1982) and &quot;New Sensations&quot; (1984), reaching a critical and commercial career peak with his 1989 album &quot;New York&quot;.

Reed participated in the re-formation of the Velvet Underground in the 1990s, and he made several more albums, including a collaboration album with John Cale titled &quot;Songs for Drella&quot;, which was a tribute to their former mentor Andy Warhol. &quot;Magic and Loss&quot; (1992) would become Reed&#x27;s highest-charting album on the UK Albums Chart, peaking at No. 6.

He contributed music to two theatrical interpretations of 19th-century writers, one of which he developed into an album titled &quot;The Raven&quot;. He married his third wife Laurie Anderson in 2008, and recorded the collaboration album &quot;Lulu&quot; with Metallica. He died in 2013 of liver disease. Reed has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice: as a member of the Velvet Underground in 1996 and as a solo act in 2015.

==Biography==
===1942–1957: Early life===
Lewis Allan Reed was born on March 2, 1942, at Beth-El Hospital (later Brookdale) in Brooklyn and grew up in Freeport, NY. Reed was the son of Toby (née Futterman) (1920–2013) and Sidney Joseph Reed (1913–2005), an accountant. His family was Jewish and his grandparents were Russian Jews who had fled antisemitism; his father had changed his name from Rabinowitz to Reed.

Reed attended Atkinson Elementary School in Freeport and went on to Freeport Junior High School. His sister Merrill, born Margaret Reed, said that as an adolescent, he suffered panic attacks, became socially awkward and &quot;possessed a fragile temperament&quot; but was highly focused on things that he liked, mainly music. Having learned to play the guitar from the radio, he developed an early interest in rock and roll and rhythm and blues, and during high school played in several bands.

Reed was dyslexic.

=== 1958–1964: Early recordings and education ===

He began using drugs at the age of 16.
Reed&#x27;s first recording was as a member of a doo-wop three-piece group called the Jades, with Reed providing guitar accompaniment and backing vocals. After participating at a talent show at Freeport Junior High School in early 1958, and receiving an enthusiastic response from the audience, the group was given the chance to record an original single &quot;So Blue&quot; with the B-side &quot;Leave Her for Me&quot; later that year. While the single did not reach any music hit parade, notable saxophonist King Curtis was brought in as a session musician by the producer Bob Shad to play on both songs, and the single was played by a substitute DJ during the Murray the K radio show, which gave Reed his first-ever airplay. Reed&#x27;s love for playing music and his desire to play gigs brought him into confrontation with his anxious and unaccommodating parents.

His sister recalled that during his first year in college, at New York University, he was brought home one day, having had a mental breakdown, after which he remained &quot;depressed, anxious, and socially unresponsive&quot; for a time, and that his parents were having difficulty coping. Visiting a psychologist, Reed&#x27;s parents were made to feel guilty as inadequate parents, and they consented to giving him electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Reed appeared to blame his father for the treatment to which he had been subjected. He wrote about the experience in his song &quot;Kill Your Sons&quot; from the album &quot;Sally Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; (1974). Reed later recalled the experience as having been traumatic and leading to memory loss. He believed that he was treated to dispel his homosexual feelings. After Reed&#x27;s death, his sister denied the ECT treatments were intended to suppress his &quot;homosexual urges&quot;, asserting that their parents were not homophobic but had been told by his doctors that ECT was necessary to treat Reed&#x27;s mental and behavioral issues.

Upon his recovery from his illness and associated treatment, Reed resumed his education at Syracuse University in 1960, studying journalism, film directing, and creative writing. He was a platoon leader in ROTC; he said he was later expelled from the program for holding an unloaded gun to his superior&#x27;s head.

Reed played music on campus under numerous band names (one being L.A. and the Eldorados) and played throughout Central New York. Per his bandmates, they were routinely kicked out of fraternity parties for their brash personalities and insistence on performing their own material. In 1961, he began hosting a late-night radio program on WAER called &quot;Excursions on a Wobbly Rail&quot;. Named after a song by pianist Cecil Taylor, the program typically featured doo wop, rhythm and blues, and jazz, particularly the free jazz developed in the mid-1950s. Reed said that when he started out he was inspired by such musicians as Ornette Coleman, who had &quot;always been a great influence&quot; on him; he said that his guitar on &quot;European Son&quot; was his way of trying to imitate the jazz saxophonist.

Reed&#x27;s sister said that during her brother&#x27;s time at Syracuse, the university authorities had tried unsuccessfully to expel him because they did not approve of his extracurricular activities. At Syracuse University, he studied under poet Delmore Schwartz, who he said was &quot;the first great person I ever met&quot;, and they became friends. He credited Schwartz with showing him how &quot;with the simplest language imaginable, and very short, you can accomplish the most astonishing heights.&quot; One of Reed&#x27;s fellow students at Syracuse in the early 1960s (who also studied under Schwartz) was the musician Garland Jeffreys; they remained close friends until the end of Reed&#x27;s life.

Jeffreys recalled Reed&#x27;s time at Syracuse: &quot;At four in the afternoon we&#x27;d all meet at [the bar] The Orange Grove. Me, Delmore and Lou. That would often be the center of the crew. And Delmore was the leader – our quiet leader.&quot; While at Syracuse, Reed was also introduced to intravenous drug use for the first time, and quickly contracted hepatitis. Reed later dedicated the song &quot;European Son&quot;, from the first Velvet Underground album, to Schwartz. In 1982, Reed recorded &quot;My House&quot; from his album &quot;The Blue Mask&quot; as a tribute to his late mentor. He later said that his goals as a writer were &quot;to bring the sensitivities of the novel to rock music&quot; or to write the Great American Novel in a record album. Reed met Sterling Morrison, a student at City University of New York, while the latter was visiting mutual friend, and fellow Syracuse student, Jim Tucker. Reed graduated from Syracuse University&#x27;s College of Arts and Sciences with a BA &quot;cum laude&quot; in English in June 1964.

===1964–1970: Pickwick and the Velvet Underground===

Reed moved to New York City in 1964 to work as an in-house songwriter for Pickwick Records. He can be heard singing lead on two cuts on &quot;The Surfsiders Sing The Beach Boys Songbook&quot;. For Pickwick, Reed also wrote and recorded the single &quot;The Ostrich&quot;, a parody of popular dance songs of the time, which included lines such as &quot;put your head on the floor and have somebody step on it&quot;. His employers felt that the song had hit potential, and assembled a supporting band to help promote the recording. The &quot;ad hoc&quot; band, called the Primitives: Reed; Welsh musician John Cale, who had recently moved to New York to study music and was playing viola in composer La Monte Young&#x27;s Theatre of Eternal Music, on bass; Tony Conrad, violinist in the Theatre of Eternal Music, on guitar; and sculptor Walter De Maria on percussion. Cale and Conrad were surprised to find that for &quot;The Ostrich&quot;, Reed tuned each string of his guitar to the same note, which they began to call his &quot;ostrich guitar&quot; tuning. This technique created a drone effect similar to their experimentation in Young&#x27;s avant-garde ensemble. Disappointed with Reed&#x27;s performance, Cale was nevertheless impressed by Reed&#x27;s early repertoire (including &quot;Heroin&quot;), and a partnership began to evolve.

Reed and Cale (who played viola, keyboards and bass guitar) lived together on the Lower East Side, and invited Reed&#x27;s college acquaintance Sterling Morrison and Cale&#x27;s neighbor and Theatre of Eternal Music bandmate Angus MacLise to join the band on guitar and drums respectively, thus forming the Velvet Underground. When the opportunity came to play their first paying gig at Summit High School in Summit, New Jersey, MacLise quit because he believed that accepting money for art was a sellout and did not want to participate in a structured gig. He was replaced on drums by Moe Tucker, the sister of Reed and Morrison&#x27;s mutual friend Jim Tucker. Initially a fill-in for that one show, she soon became a full-time member with her drumming an integral part of the band&#x27;s sound, despite Cale&#x27;s initial objections. Though it had little commercial success, the band is considered one of the most influential in rock history. Reed was the main singer and songwriter in the band.

The band soon came to the attention of Andy Warhol. One of Warhol&#x27;s first contributions was to integrate them into the Exploding Plastic Inevitable. Warhol&#x27;s associates inspired many of Reed&#x27;s songs as he fell into a thriving, multifaceted artistic scene. Reed rarely gave an interview without paying homage to Warhol as a mentor. Warhol pushed the band to take on a chanteuse, the German former model and singer Nico. Despite his initial resistance, Reed wrote several songs for Nico to sing, and the two were briefly lovers.

&quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; was released in March 1967 and peaked at No. 171 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Much later, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed it as the 13th greatest album of all time; Musician Brian Eno once stated that although few people bought the album at the time of its release, most of those who did were inspired to form their own bands. Václav Havel credited the album, which he bought while visiting the U.S., with inspiring him to become president of Czechoslovakia.

By the time the band recorded &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot;, Nico had quit the band and Warhol had been fired, both against Cale&#x27;s wishes. Warhol&#x27;s replacement as manager was Steve Sesnick. In September 1968, Reed told Morrison and Tucker that he would dissolve the band if they did not let him fire Cale; they agreed, and Reed had Morrison inform Cale of his firing. Morrison and Tucker were discomfited by Reed&#x27;s tactics but remained in the band. Cale&#x27;s replacement was Boston-based musician Doug Yule, who played bass guitar and keyboards and would soon share lead vocal duties with Reed. The band now took on a more pop-oriented sound and acted more as a vehicle for Reed to develop his songwriting craft. They released two studio albums with this lineup: 1969&#x27;s &quot;The Velvet Underground&quot; and 1970&#x27;s &quot;Loaded&quot;. Reed left the Velvet Underground in August 1970. The band disintegrated after Morrison and Tucker departed in 1971, and their final album &quot;Squeeze&quot; was almost entirely Yule&#x27;s work.

===1970–1975: Glam rock and commercial breakthrough===
After leaving the Velvet Underground, Reed moved to his parents&#x27; home on Long Island, and took a job at his father&#x27;s tax accounting firm as a typist, by his own account earning $40 a week ($ in dollars). He began writing poetry, which was published later in 2018 by Anthology Editions through the Lou Reed Estate. He signed a recording contract with RCA Records in 1971 and recorded his first solo album at Morgan Studios in Willesden, London with session musicians including Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman from the band Yes. The album, &quot;Lou Reed&quot;, contained versions of unreleased Velvet Underground songs, some of which had originally been recorded for &quot;Loaded&quot; but shelved. This album was overlooked by most pop music critics and did not sell well, although music critic Stephen Holden, in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, called it an &quot;almost perfect album. ... which embodied the spirit of the Velvets.&quot; Holden went on to compare Reed&#x27;s voice with those of Mick Jagger and Bob Dylan and praise the poetic quality of his lyrics.

Reed&#x27;s commercial breakthrough album, &quot;Transformer&quot;, was released in November 1972. &quot;Transformer&quot; was co-produced by David Bowie and Mick Ronson, and it introduced Reed to a wider audience, especially in the UK. The single &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; was a salute to the misfits and hustlers who once surrounded Andy Warhol in the late &#x27;60s and appeared in his films. Each of the song&#x27;s five verses describes a person who had been a fixture at The Factory during the mid-to-late 1960s: (1) Holly Woodlawn, (2) Candy Darling, (3) &quot;Little Joe&quot; Dallesandro, (4) &quot;Sugar Plum Fairy&quot; Joe Campbell and (5) Jackie Curtis. The song&#x27;s transgressive lyrics evaded radio censorship. Though the jazzy arrangement (courtesy of bassist Herbie Flowers and saxophonist Ronnie Ross) was musically atypical for Reed, it eventually became his signature song. It came about as a result of a commission to compose a soundtrack to a theatrical adaptation of Nelson Algren&#x27;s novel of the same name; the play failed to materialize. &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; was Reed&#x27;s only entry in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart, at No. 16.

Ronson&#x27;s arrangements brought out new aspects of Reed&#x27;s songs. &quot;Perfect Day&quot;, for example, features delicate strings and soaring dynamics. It was rediscovered in the 1990s and allowed Reed to drop &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; from his concerts.

Several years later, Bowie and Reed fell out during a late-night meeting which led to Reed hitting Bowie. Bowie had reportedly told Reed that he would have to &quot;clean up his act&quot; if they were to work together again.

Reed hired a local New York bar-band, the Tots, to tour in support of &quot;Transformer&quot; and spent much of 1972 and early 1973 on the road with them. Though they improved over the months, Reed (with producer Bob Ezrin&#x27;s encouragement) decided to recruit a new backing band in anticipation of the upcoming &quot;Berlin&quot; album. He chose keyboardist Moogy Klingman to come up with a new five-member band on barely a week&#x27;s notice.

&quot;Berlin&quot; (July 1973) was a concept album about two speed-freaks in love in the city. The songs variously concern domestic violence (&quot;Caroline Says I&quot;, &quot;Caroline Says II&quot;), drug addiction (&quot;How Do You Think It Feels&quot;), adultery and prostitution (&quot;The Kids&quot;), and suicide (&quot;The Bed&quot;). Reed&#x27;s late 1973 European tour, featuring lead guitarists Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner, mixed his &quot;Berlin&quot; material with older numbers. Response to &quot;Berlin&quot; at the time of its release was generally negative, with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; pronouncing it &quot;a disaster&quot;. Reed found the poor reviews it received very disheartening. Since then the album has been critically reevaluated, and in 2003 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; included it in their list of the 500 greatest albums of all time. &quot;Berlin&quot; peaked at No. 7 on the UK Albums Chart.

Following the commercial disappointment of &quot;Berlin&quot;, Reed befriended Steve Katz of Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears (brother of his then-manager Dennis Katz), who suggested Reed put together a &quot;great live band&quot; and release a live album of Velvet Underground songs. Katz would come on board as producer, and the album &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Animal&quot; (February 1974) contained live performances of the Velvet Underground songs &quot;Sweet Jane&quot;, &quot;Heroin&quot;, &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot;, and &quot;Rock and Roll&quot;. Wagner&#x27;s live arrangements, and Hunter&#x27;s intro to &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; which opened the album, gave Reed&#x27;s songs the live rock sound he was looking for, and the album peaked at No. 45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for 28 weeks and soon became Reed&#x27;s biggest selling album. It went gold in 1978, with 500,000 certified sales.

&quot;Sally Can&#x27;t Dance&quot; which was released later that year (in August 1974), became Reed&#x27;s highest-charting album in the United States, peaking at No. 10 during a 14-week stay on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart in October 1974.

In October 2019, an audio tape of publicly unknown music by Reed, based on Warhol&#x27;s 1975 book, &quot;The Philosophy of Andy Warhol: From A to B and Back Again&quot;, was reported to have been discovered in an archive at The Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

===1975–1979: Addiction and creative work===
Throughout the 1970s, Reed was a heavy user of methamphetamine and alcohol. In the summer of 1975, he was booked to headline Startruckin&#x27; 75 in Europe, a touring rock festival organized by Miles Copeland. However, Reed&#x27;s drug addiction made him unreliable and he never performed on the tour, causing Copeland to replace him with Ike &amp; Tina Turner.

Reed&#x27;s double album &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot; (1975) was an hour of modulated feedback and guitar effects. Described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as the &quot;tubular groaning of a galactic refrigerator&quot;, many critics interpreted it as a gesture of contempt, an attempt to break his contract with RCA or to alienate his less sophisticated fans. Reed claimed that the album was a genuine artistic effort inspired by the drone music of La Monte Young, and suggesting that references to classical music could be found buried in the feedback, but he also said, &quot;Well, anyone who gets to side four is dumber than I am.&quot; Lester Bangs declared it &quot;genius&quot;, though also psychologically disturbing. The album, now regarded as a visionary textural guitar masterpiece by some music critics, was reportedly returned to stores by the thousands and was withdrawn after a few weeks.

1975&#x27;s &quot;Coney Island Baby&quot; was dedicated to Reed&#x27;s then-partner Rachel Humphreys, a transgender woman Reed dated and lived with for three years. Humphreys also appears in the photos on the cover of Reed&#x27;s 1977 &quot;best of&quot; album, &quot;Walk on the Wild Side: The Best of Lou Reed&quot;. &quot;Rock and Roll Heart&quot; was his 1976 debut for his new record label Arista, and &quot;Street Hassle&quot; (1978) was released in the midst of the punk rock scene he had helped to inspire. Reed took on a watchful, competitive and sometimes dismissive attitude towards punk. Aware that he had inspired the scene, he regularly attended shows at CBGB to track the artistic and commercial development of numerous punk bands, and a cover illustration and interview of Reed appeared in the first issue of &quot;Punk&quot; magazine by Legs McNeil.

Reed released his third live album, &quot;&quot;, in 1978; some critics thought it was his &quot;bravest work yet&quot;, while others considered it his &quot;silliest&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described it as &quot;one of the funniest live albums ever recorded&quot; and compared Reed&#x27;s monologs with those of Lenny Bruce. Reed felt it was his best album to date. &quot;The Bells&quot; (1979) featured jazz trumpeter Don Cherry. During 1979 Reed toured extensively in Europe and throughout the United States performing a wide range of songs, including a suite of core songs from his &quot;Berlin&quot; album and the title track from &quot;The Bells&quot; featuring Chuck Hammer on guitar-synth. Around this time Reed also appeared as a record producer in Paul Simon&#x27;s film &quot;One-Trick Pony&quot;. From around 1979 Reed began to wean himself off drugs.

===1980–1989: Mid-period===

Reed&#x27;s 1980 marriage to designer Sylvia Morales inspired Reed to write several songs, particularly &quot;Think It Over&quot; from 1980&#x27;s &quot;Growing Up in Public&quot; and &quot;Heavenly Arms&quot; from 1982&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Mask&quot;. The latter album was enthusiastically received by critics such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer Tom Carson, whose review began, &quot;Lou Reed&#x27;s &quot;The Blue Mask&quot; is a great record, and its genius is at once so simple and unusual that the only appropriate reaction is wonder. Who expected anything like this from Reed at this late stage of the game?&quot; In the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau called &quot;The Blue Mask&quot; &quot;his most controlled, plainspoken, deeply felt, and uninhibited album.&quot; After &quot;Legendary Hearts&quot; (1983) and &quot;New Sensations&quot; (1984), Reed was sufficiently reestablished as a public figure to become a spokesman for Honda scooters. In the early 1980s, Reed worked with guitarists including Chuck Hammer on &quot;Growing Up in Public&quot;, and Robert Quine on &quot;The Blue Mask&quot; and &quot;Legendary Hearts&quot;.

Reed&#x27;s 1984 album &quot;New Sensations&quot; marked the first time that Reed had charted within the US Top 100 since 1978&#x27;s &quot;Street Hassle&quot;, and the first time that Reed had charted in the UK altogether since 1976&#x27;s &quot;Coney Island Baby&quot;. Although its lead single &quot;I Love You, Suzanne&quot; only charted at No. 78 on the UK Singles Chart it did receive light rotation on MTV. Two more singles were released from the album: &quot;My Red Joystick&quot; and the Dutch-only release &quot;High in the City&quot; but they both failed to chart.

In 1998, &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed that in the 1970s, Reed had a distinctive persona: &quot;Back then he was publicly gay, pretended to shoot heroin onstage, and cultivated a &#x27;Dachau panda&#x27; look, with cropped peroxide hair and black circles painted under his eyes.&quot; The newspaper wrote that in 1980, &quot;Reed renounced druggy theatrics, even swore off intoxicants themselves, and became openly heterosexual, openly married.&quot;

On September 22, 1985, Reed performed at the first Farm Aid concert in Champaign, Illinois. He performed &quot;Doin&#x27; the Things That We Want To&quot;, &quot;I Love You, Suzanne&quot;, &quot;New Sensations&quot; and &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; as his solo set. In June 1986, Reed released &quot;Mistrial&quot; (co-produced with bassist Fernando Saunders). To support the album, he released two music videos: &quot;No Money Down&quot; and &quot;The Original Wrapper&quot;. In the same year, he joined Amnesty International&#x27;s A Conspiracy of Hope short tour and was outspoken about New York City&#x27;s political issues and personalities. He also appeared on Steven Van Zandt&#x27;s 1985 anti-Apartheid song &quot;Sun City&quot;, pledging not to play at that resort.

The 1989 album &quot;New York&quot;, which commented on crime, AIDS, civil rights activist Jesse Jackson, then-President of Austria Kurt Waldheim, and Pope John Paul II, became his second gold-certified work when it passed 500,000 sales in 1997. Reed was nominated for a Grammy Award for best male rock vocal performance for the album.

===1990–1999: Velvet Underground reunion and various projects===
Reed met John Cale for the first time in several years at Warhol&#x27;s funeral in 1987. They worked together on the album &quot;Songs for Drella&quot; (April 1990), a song cycle about Warhol. On the album, Reed sings of his love for his late friend, and criticizes both the doctors who were unable to save Warhol&#x27;s life and Warhol&#x27;s would-be assassin, Valerie Solanas. In 1990, the first Velvet Underground lineup reformed for a Fondation Cartier benefit show in France. In June and July 1993, the Velvet Underground again reunited and toured Europe, including an appearance at the Glastonbury Festival; plans for a North American tour were canceled following a dispute between Reed and Cale.

Reed had released his sixteenth solo album, &quot;Magic and Loss&quot;, in January 1992. The album is focused on mortality, inspired by the death of two close friends from cancer. In 1994, he appeared in &quot;A Celebration: The Music of Pete Townshend and The Who&quot;. In 1995, Reed made a cameo appearance in the unreleased video game &quot;Penn &amp; Teller&#x27;s Smoke and Mirrors&quot;. If the player selects the &quot;impossible&quot; difficulty setting, Reed appears shortly after the game begins as an unbeatable boss who murders the player with his laser beam eyes. Reed then pops up on the screen and says to the player, &quot;This is the impossible level, boys. Impossible doesn&#x27;t mean very difficult, very difficult is winning the Nobel Prize, impossible is eating the sun.&quot;

The Velvet Underground were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. At the ceremony, Reed, Cale and Tucker performed a song titled &quot;Last Night I Said Goodbye to My Friend&quot;, dedicated to Sterling Morrison, who had died the previous August. In February 1996 Reed released &quot;Set the Twilight Reeling&quot;, and later that year, Reed contributed songs and music to &quot;Time Rocker&quot;, a theatrical interpretation of H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The Time Machine&quot; by experimental director Robert Wilson. The piece premiered in the Thalia Theater, Hamburg, and was later also shown at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York.

In 1997, the BBC created a version of Perfect Day which featured many artists, including Reed. Initially created for advertising purposes, it was later released as a charity single for Children in Need and became a Uk no.1 single.

===2000–2012: Rock and ambient experimentation===
In February 2000, Reed worked with Robert Wilson at the Thalia Theater again, on POEtry, another production inspired by the works of a 19th-century writer, this time Edgar Allan Poe. In April 2000, Reed released &quot;Ecstasy&quot;. In January 2003, Reed released a 2-CD set, &quot;The Raven&quot;, based on POEtry. The album consists of songs written by Reed and spoken-word performances of reworked and rewritten texts of Edgar Allan Poe by actors, set to electronic music composed by Reed. It features Willem Dafoe, David Bowie, Steve Buscemi, and Ornette Coleman. A single disc CD version of the album, focusing on the music, was also released.

In May 2000, Reed performed before Pope John Paul II at the Great Jubilee Concert in Rome. In 2001, Reed made a cameo appearance in the movie adaptation of &quot;Prozac Nation&quot;. On October 6, 2001, &quot;the New York Times&quot; published a Reed poem called &quot;Laurie Sadly Listening&quot; in which he reflects on the September 11 attacks (also referred to as 9/11). Incorrect reports of Reed&#x27;s death were broadcast by numerous US radio stations in 2001, caused by a hoax email (purporting to be from Reuters) which said he had died of a drug overdose. In April 2003, Reed began a world tour featuring the cellist Jane Scarpantoni and singer Anohni.

In 2003, Reed released a book of photographs, &quot;Emotions in Action&quot;. This comprised an A4-sized book called &quot;Emotions&quot; and a smaller one called &quot;Actions&quot; laid into its hard cover. In January 2006, he released a second book of photographs, &quot;Lou Reed&#x27;s New York&quot;. A third volume, &quot;Romanticism&quot;, was released in 2009.
In 2004, a Groovefinder remix of his song &quot;Satellite of Love&quot;, called &quot;Satellite of Love &#x27;04&quot;, was released. It peaked at No. 10 on the UK Singles Chart.

In October 2006, Reed appeared at Hal Willner&#x27;s Leonard Cohen tribute show &quot;Came So Far for Beauty&quot; in Dublin, along with Laurie Anderson, Nick Cave, Anohni, Jarvis Cocker, and Beth Orton. He played a heavy metal version of Cohen&#x27;s &quot;The Stranger Song&quot;.

In December that year, Reed played a series of shows at St. Ann&#x27;s Warehouse, Brooklyn, based on &quot;Berlin&quot;. Reed played with guitarist Steve Hunter, who played on the original album and &quot;Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Animal&quot;, and was joined by singers Anohni and Sharon Jones. The show was produced by Bob Ezrin, who also produced the original album, and Hal Willner. The show played at the Sydney Festival in January 2007 and in Europe during June and July 2007. The album version of the concert, entitled &quot;&quot;, and a live film recording of these concerts were both released in 2008. In April 2007, he released &quot;Hudson River Wind Meditations&quot;, an album of ambient meditational music. It was released on the Sounds True record label. In June 2007, he performed at the Traffic Festival 2007 in Turin, Italy, a five-day free event organized by the city. In the same month &quot;Pale Blue Eyes&quot; was included in the soundtrack of the French-language film, &quot;The Diving Bell and the Butterfly.&quot; In August 2007, Reed recorded &quot;Tranquilize&quot; with The Killers in New York City, a duet with Brandon Flowers for the B-side/rarities album &quot;Sawdust&quot;.

On October 2 and 3, 2008, he introduced his new group, which was later named Metal Machine Trio, at the Walt Disney Concert Hall Complex in Los Angeles. The trio featured Ulrich Krieger (saxophone) and Sarth Calhoun (electronics), and played improvised instrumental music inspired by &quot;Metal Machine Music&quot;. Recordings of the concerts were released under the title &quot;The Creation of the Universe&quot;. The trio played at New York&#x27;s Gramercy Theatre in April 2009, and appeared as part of Reed&#x27;s band at the 2009 Lollapalooza.

Reed provided the voice of Maltazard, the villain in the 2009 Luc Besson animated/live-action feature film &quot;Arthur and the Revenge of Maltazard&quot; and appeared as himself in Wim Wenders&#x27; 2008 film &quot;Palermo Shooting&quot;.

Reed played &quot;Sweet Jane&quot; and &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; with Metallica at Madison Square Garden during the twenty-fifth anniversary celebration of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on October 30, 2009. In 2010, Reed featured on the song &quot;Some Kind of Nature&quot; with virtual band Gorillaz, from their third studio album &quot;Plastic Beach&quot;. In October 2011, Metallica and Reed released the collaboration album &quot;Lulu&quot;. It was based on the &quot;Lulu&quot; plays by the German playwright Frank Wedekind (1864–1918). The album received mixed and mainly negative reviews from music critics. Reed joked that he had no fans left after Metal Machine Music. The album debuted at No. 36 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 13,000 copies, and went on to sell 280,000 copies worldwide.

In 2012, Reed collaborated with indie rock band Metric on &quot;The Wanderlust&quot;, the tenth track on their fifth studio album &quot;Synthetica&quot;. This was to be the last original composition he worked on.

==Personal life==
Reed married Bettye Kronstad in 1973. She later said he had been a violent drunk when on tour. From 1973 through early 1978, Reed was in a relationship with Rachel Humphreys, a trans woman he met at Club 82. Reed married British designer Sylvia Morales in 1980. In 1994, they divorced. From 1992 on, Reed was romantically linked to musician and artist Laurie Anderson, and the two worked together on several recordings. They married on April 12, 2008.

Reed said that despite his Jewish background, his &quot;real god was rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll&quot;. He practiced tai chi during the last part of his life. He studied meditation with Tibetan Buddhist teacher Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche, and described himself as &quot;a student of Buddhist philosophy.&quot;

==Death, legacy, and honors==
Reed had hepatitis and diabetes for several years. He was treated with interferons but developed liver cancer. In May 2013, he underwent a liver transplant at the Cleveland Clinic. Afterward, he wrote on his website of feeling &quot;bigger and stronger&quot; than ever. On October 27, 2013, however, he died from liver disease at his home in East Hampton, New York, at the age of 71. He was cremated and the ashes were given to his family.

His widow, Laurie Anderson, said his last days were peaceful, and described him as a &quot;prince and a fighter&quot;. David Byrne, Patti Smith, David Bowie, Morrissey, Miley Cyrus, Iggy Pop, Courtney Love, Lenny Kravitz, and many others also paid tribute to Reed. Former Velvet Underground members Moe Tucker and John Cale made statements on Reed&#x27;s death, and those from outside the music industry paid their respects such as Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi.

On October 27, 2013, the day of Reed&#x27;s death, Pearl Jam dedicated their song &quot;Man of the Hour&quot; to him at their show in Baltimore and then played &quot;I&#x27;m Waiting for the Man&quot;. On the same day, The Killers dedicated their rendition of &quot;Pale Blue Eyes&quot; to Reed at the Life Is Beautiful festival in Las Vegas. My Morning Jacket performed a cover of &quot;Oh! Sweet Nuthin&#x27;&quot; in California, while Arctic Monkeys performed &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; in Liverpool. That same night, Phish opened their show in Hartford, Connecticut, with the Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;Rock &amp; Roll&quot;. Lana Del Rey has said that Reed was supposed to record backing vocals on her single, &quot;Brooklyn Baby&quot;, on the day of his death. On November 14, 2013, a three-hour public memorial was held near Lincoln Center&#x27;s Paul Milstein Pool and Terrace. Billed as &quot;New York: Lou Reed at Lincoln Center&quot;, the ceremony featured favorite Reed recordings selected by family and friends. On March 14, 2014, Richard Barone and Alejandro Escovedo produced and hosted the first full-scale tribute to Lou Reed at the SXSW Music Festival in Austin, Texas, with over twenty international acts performing Reed&#x27;s music.

Reed&#x27;s estate was valued at $30 million, $20 million of which accrued after his death. He left everything to his wife and his sister.

Reed&#x27;s induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist was announced on December 16, 2014. He was inducted by Patti Smith at a ceremony in Cleveland on April 18, 2015. In 2017, &quot;Lou Reed: A Life&quot; was published by the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Anthony DeCurtis.

Asteroid 270553 Loureed, discovered by Maik Meyer at Palomar Observatory in 2002, was named in his honor. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on June 2, 2015 (). Spiders with furry bodies are known as velvet spiders and one which was recently discovered in Spain is named &quot;Loureedia&quot;, because it has a velvet body and lives underground.

An archive of his letters and other personal effects was donated to the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, where it can be viewed by members of the public. In June 2022, the Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center hosted the &quot;Lou Reed: Caught Between the Twisted Stars&quot;, the first exhibition drawn from Reed&#x27;s archive.

In 2015, in the unofficial biography &quot;Notes From The Velvet Underground&quot;, biographer Howard Sounes described Reed as having been misogynistic and violent toward women he was in relationships with and racist, having called Donna Summer and Bob Dylan racial and ethnic slurs.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Reed at number 107 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

In 2023, Laurie Anderson edited &quot;The Art of the Straight Line: My Tai Chi&quot;. The critically acclaimed book covers Reed&#x27;s deep love and commitment to tai chi and meditation, as told by Reed and his friends and family.

===Posthumous release===
In June 2022, &quot;Lou Reed Archive Series&quot; was announced by Light in the Attic Records with Laurie Anderson. The collection has released unreleased material with an album called &quot;Words &amp; Music, May 1965&quot;. Along with a reissue of his final solo studio album Hudson River Wind Meditations.

==Artistry==
Reed&#x27;s songwriting style has been described as &quot;unusually literate&quot; and often contained themes considered to be transgressive during the 1960s, namely drugs and sex. Reed was heavily influenced by literature and poetry, and strived to apply creative autonomy allowed in literature to rock music. He was known for the noisy nature of his lead guitar style.

==Equipment==

===Guitars===
Reed&#x27;s main guitar during the Velvet Underground era was a 1964 Gretsch Country Gentleman, which he modified extensively, to the extent that it became unplayable. Modifications included the addition of Stratocaster pick ups, a repeater effect with speed and tremolo controls taken from a Vox pedal, stereo outputs, and a battery powered pre-amp. He later played various stock Fender Telecasters, favoring models that were built specifically for him, such as the Rick Kelly &#x27;Lou Reed&#x27;s T&#x27; Custom Telecaster and the Fender Custom Shop Danny Gatton Telecaster. He played various other electric guitars throughout his career:
* Carl Thompson

<text>The Papal States ( ; ; ), officially the State of the Church, were a conglomeration of territories on the Italian peninsula under the direct sovereign rule of the Pope from 756 to 1870. They were among the major states of Italy from the 8th century until the unification of Italy, which took place between 1859 and 1870, and culminated in their demise.

The state was legally established in the 8th century when Pepin the Short, king of the Franks, gifted Pope Stephen II, as a temporal sovereign, lands formerly held by Arian Christian Lombards adding them to lands and other real estate formerly acquired and held by the bishops of Rome as landlords from the time of Constantine onward. This donation came about as part of a process whereby the popes began to turn away from the Byzantine emperors as their foremost temporal guardians for reasons such as increased imperial taxes, disagreement with respect to iconoclasm, and failure of the emperors, or their exarchs in Italy, to protect Rome and the rest of the peninsula from barbarian invasion and pillage. 

During the Renaissance, the papal territory expanded greatly, and the Pope became one of Italy&#x27;s most important rulers as well as the head of Western Christianity. At their zenith, the Papal States covered most of the modern Italian regions of Lazio (which includes Rome), Marche, Umbria, Romagna, and portions of Emilia. The popes&#x27; reign over these lands was an exemplification of their temporal powers as secular rulers, as opposed to their ecclesiastical primacy.

By 1860, much of the Papal States&#x27; territory had been conquered by the Kingdom of Italy. Only Lazio, including Rome, remained under the Pope&#x27;s temporal control. In 1870, the Pope lost Lazio and Rome and had no physical territory at all, except the Leonine City within Rome, which the new Italian state refrained from occupying militarily, despite its annexation. In 1929, the Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini, the head of the Italian government, ended the &quot;Prisoner in the Vatican&quot; problem involving a unified Italy and the Holy See by negotiating the Lateran Treaty, signed by the two parties. This treaty recognized the sovereignty of the Holy See over a newly created territorial entity, a city-state within Rome limited to a token territory which became the Vatican City, with the pope as its sovereign.

==Name==
The Papal States were also known as the &quot;Papal State&quot;; although the plural is usually preferred, the singular is equally correct as the polity was more than a mere personal union. The territories were referred to variously as the &quot;State(s) of the Church&quot;, the &quot;Pontifical States&quot;, the &quot;Ecclesiastical States&quot;, the &quot;Patrimony of St Peter&quot; or the &quot;Roman States&quot; (, also &#x27;, &#x27;, &#x27;, and &#x27;; , also &quot;&quot; &quot;papal rule&quot;). To some extent, the name used varied with the preferences and habits of the European languages in which it was expressed.

For its first 300 years, within the Roman Empire, the Church was persecuted and unable to hold or transfer property. Early congregations met in rooms set aside for the purpose in the homes of wealthy adherents, and a number of titular churches located on the outskirts of Rome were held as property by individuals, rather than by any corporate body. Nonetheless, the property held nominally or actually by individual members of the Roman churches would usually be treated as a common patrimony handed over successively to the legitimate &quot;heir&quot; of that property, often its senior deacons, who were, in turn, assistants to the local bishop. This common patrimony became quite considerable, including as it did not only houses etc. in Rome or nearby but also landed estates, such as latifundia, whole or in part, across Italy and beyond.

A law of Constantine the Great, promulgated in 321, allowed the Christian Church to possess property and restored to it any property formerly confiscated; in the larger cities of this empire the property restored would have been quite considerable, the Roman patrimony not least among them. The Lateran Palace was gifted to the patrimony, most probably from Constantine himself.

Other donations followed, primarily in mainland Italy but also in the provinces of the Roman Empire. However, the Roman Church held all of these lands as a private landowner, not as a sovereign entity. Following the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the papacy found itself increasingly placed in a precarious and vulnerable position. As central Roman authority disintegrated throughout the late 5th century, control over the Italian peninsula repeatedly changed hands, falling under the Arian suzerainty of Odoacer in 473, and in 493, Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths. The Ostrogothic kings would continue to rule much of Italy until 554. The Roman Church submitted of necessity to their sovereign authority, while asserting its spiritual primacy over the whole of Christendom.

Beginning in 535, the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I launched a series of campaigns to wrest Italy from the Ostrogoths which continued until 554 and devastated Italy&#x27;s political and economic structures. Justinian established the Exarchate of Ravenna of which the Duchy of Rome, an area roughly coterminous with modern day Lazio, was an administrative division. In 568 the Lombards entered the peninsula from the north, establishing their own Italian kingdom, and over the next two centuries would conquer most of the Italian territory recently regained by Byzantium. By the 7th century, Byzantine authority was largely limited to a diagonal band running roughly from Ravenna, where the emperor&#x27;s vicar, or &quot;exarch&quot;, was located, to Rome and south to Naples, plus coastal exclaves. North of Naples, the band of Byzantine control contracted, and the borders of the &quot;Rome-Ravenna corridor&quot; became extremely narrow.

With effective Byzantine power weighted at the northeast end of this territory, the pope, as the largest landowner and most prestigious figure in Italy, began by default to take on much of the ruling authority that the Byzantines were unable to exercise in the areas surrounding the city of Rome. While the popes legally remained &quot;Roman subjects&quot; under Byzantine authority, in practice the Duchy of Rome became an independent state.

Popular support for the popes in Italy enabled several to defy the will of the Byzantine emperor: Pope Gregory II excommunicated Emperor Leo III during the Iconoclastic Controversy. Nevertheless, the Pope and the exarch still worked together to limit the rising power of the Lombards in Italy. As Byzantine power weakened, though, the papacy assumed an ever-larger role in protecting Rome from the Lombards, but lacking direct control over sizable military assets, the pope relied mainly on diplomacy to achieve as much. In practice, these papal efforts served to focus Lombard on the exarch and Ravenna. A climactic moment in the founding of the Papal States was the agreement over boundaries contained in the Lombardic King Liutprand&#x27;s &quot;Donation of Sutri&quot; (728) to Pope Gregory II.

===Donation of Pepin===

When the Exarchate of Ravenna finally fell to the Lombards in 751, the Duchy of Rome was completely cut off from the Byzantine Empire, of which it was theoretically still a part. The popes renewed earlier attempts to secure the support of the Franks. In 751, Pope Zachary had Pepin the Short crowned king in place of the powerless Merovingian figurehead King Childeric III. Zachary&#x27;s successor, Pope Stephen II, later granted Pepin the title &quot;Patrician of the Romans&quot;. Pepin led a Frankish army into Italy in 754 and 756, defeated the Lombards, thus taking control of northern Italy, and made a gift of the lands formerly constituting the Exarchate of Ravenna to the pope.

In 781, Charlemagne codified the regions over which the pope would be temporal sovereign: the Duchy of Rome, Ravenna, the Duchy of the Pentapolis, parts of the Duchy of Benevento, Tuscany, Corsica, Lombardy, and a number of Italian cities. The cooperation between the papacy and the Carolingian dynasty climaxed in 800 when Pope Leo III crowned Charlemagne &#x27;Emperor of the Romans&#x27;.

===Relationship with the Holy Roman Empire===
From the 9th century to the 12th century, the precise nature of the relationship between the popes and emperors – and between the Papal States and the Empire – was disputed. It was unclear whether the Papal States were a separate realm with the Pope as their sovereign ruler, or a part of the Frankish Empire over which the popes had administrative control, as suggested in the late-9th-century treatise &quot;Libellus de imperatoria potestate in urbe Roma&quot;, or whether the Holy Roman emperors were vicars of the Pope ruling Christendom, with the Pope directly responsible only for the environs of Rome and spiritual duties.

The Holy Roman Empire in its Frankish form collapsed when it was subdivided among Charlemagne&#x27;s grandchildren. Imperial power in Italy waned and the papacy&#x27;s prestige declined. This led to a rise in the power of the local Roman nobility, and the control of the Papal States during the early 10th century passed to a powerful and corrupt aristocratic family, the Theophylacti. This period was later dubbed the (&quot;dark age&quot;), and sometimes as the &quot;rule by harlots&quot;.

In practice, the popes were unable to exercise effective sovereignty over the extensive and mountainous territories of the Papal States, and the region preserved its old system of government, with many small countships and marquisates, each centred upon a fortified &quot;rocca&quot;.

Over several campaigns in the mid-10th century, the German ruler Otto I conquered northern Italy; Pope John XII crowned him emperor (the first so crowned in more than forty years) and the two of them ratified the Diploma Ottonianum, by which the emperor became the guarantor of the independence of the Papal States. Yet over the next two centuries, popes and emperors squabbled over a variety of issues, and the German rulers routinely treated the Papal States as part of their realms on those occasions when they projected power into Northern and Central Italy. As the Gregorian Reform worked to free the administration of the church from imperial interference, the independence of the Papal States increased in importance. After the extinction of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, the German emperors rarely interfered in Italian affairs. In response to the struggle between the Guelphs and Ghibellines, the Treaty of Venice made official the independence of the Papal States from the Holy Roman Empire in 1177. By 1300, the Papal States, along with the rest of the Italian principalities, were effectively independent.

===Avignon Papacy===

From 1305 to 1378, the popes lived in the papal enclave of Avignon, surrounded by Provence and under the influence of the French kings. This period was known as the &quot;Avignonese&quot; or &quot;Babylonian Captivity&quot;. During this period the city of Avignon itself and the surrounding Comtat Venaissin was added to the Papal States; it remained a papal possession for some 400 years even after the popes returned to Rome, until it was seized and incorporated into the French state during the French Revolution.

During the Avignon Papacy, local despots took advantage of the absence of the popes to establish themselves in nominally papal cities: the Pepoli in Bologna, the Ordelaffi in Forlì, the Manfredi in Faenza, and the Malatesta in Rimini all gave nominal acknowledgment to their papal overlords and were declared vicars of the Church.

In Ferrara, the death of Azzo VIII d&#x27;Este without legitimate heirs (1308) encouraged Pope Clement V to bring Ferrara under his direct rule: however, it was governed by his appointed vicar, King Robert of Naples, for only nine years before the citizens recalled the Este from exile (1317). Interdiction and excommunications were in vain because in 1332, John XXII was obliged to name three Este brothers as his vicars in Ferrara.

In Rome itself, the Orsini and the Colonna struggled for supremacy, dividing the city&#x27;s &quot;rioni&quot; between them. The resulting aristocratic anarchy in the city provided the setting for the fantastic dreams of universal democracy of Cola di Rienzo, who was acclaimed Tribune of the People in 1347, and met a violent death in early October 1354 as he was assassinated by supporters of the Colonna family. To many, rather than an ancient Roman tribune reborn, he had become just another tyrant using the rhetoric of Roman renewal and rebirth to mask his grab for power. As Guido Ruggiero states, &quot;even with the support of Petrarch, his return to first times and the rebirth of ancient Rome was one that would not prevail.&quot;

The Rienzo episode engendered renewed attempts from the absentee papacy to re-establish order in the dissolving Papal States, resulting in the military progress of Cardinal Albornoz, who was appointed papal legate, and his condottieri heading a small mercenary army. Having received the support of the archbishop of Milan, Giovanni Visconti, he defeated Giovanni di Vico, lord of Viterbo, moving against Galeotto Malatesta of Rimini and the Ordelaffi of Forlì, the Montefeltro of Urbino and the da Polenta of Ravenna, and against the cities of Senigallia and Ancona. The last holdouts against full Papal control were Giovanni Manfredi of Faenza and Francesco II Ordelaffi of Forlì. Albornoz, at the point of being recalled, in a meeting with all the Papal vicars on 29 April 1357, promulgated the &quot;Constitutiones Sanctæ Matris Ecclesiæ&quot;, which replaced the mosaic of local law and accumulated traditional &#x27;liberties&#x27; with a uniform code of civil law. These &quot;Constitutiones Aegidianae&quot; (as they are informally known) mark a watershed in the legal history of the Papal States; they remained in effect until 1816. Pope Urban V ventured a return to Italy in 1367 that proved premature; he returned to Avignon in 1370 just before his death.

===Renaissance===


During the Renaissance, the Papal territory expanded greatly, notably under Popes Alexander VI and Julius II. The Pope became one of Italy&#x27;s most important secular rulers as well as the head of the Church, signing treaties with other sovereigns and fighting wars. In practice, though, most of the Papal States were still only nominally controlled by the Pope, and much of the territory was ruled by minor princes. Control was always contested; indeed it took until the 16th century for the Pope to have any genuine control over all his territories.

Papal responsibilities were often in conflict. The Papal States were involved in at least three wars in the first two decades of the 16th century. Julius II, the &quot;Warrior Pope&quot;, fought on their behalf.

===Reformation===
The Reformation began in 1517. In 1527, before the Holy Roman Empire fought the Protestants, troops loyal to Emperor Charles V brutally sacked Rome and imprisoned Pope Clement VII, as a side effect of battles over the Papal States. Thus Clement VII was forced to give up Parma, Modena, and several smaller territories. A generation later the armies of King Philip II of Spain defeated those of Pope Paul IV in the Italian War of 1551–1559, fought to prevent growing Spanish dominance in Italy.

This period saw a gradual revival of the pope&#x27;s temporal power in the Papal States. Throughout the 16th century, virtually independent fiefs such as Rimini (a possession of the Malatesta family) were brought back under Papal control. In 1512 the state of the church annexed Parma and Piacenza, which in 1545 became an independent duchy under an illegitimate son of Pope Paul III. This process culminated in the reclaiming of the Duchy of Ferrara in 1598, and the Duchy of Urbino in 1631.

In 1649, after the annexation of the Duchy of Castro, the Papal States reached their greatest extent, including most of central Italy – Latium, Umbria, Marche, and the legations of Ravenna, Ferrara, and Bologna extending north into the Romagna. It also included the small enclaves of Benevento and Pontecorvo in southern Italy and the larger Comtat Venaissin around Avignon in southern France.

===Roman Republic, Napoleonic era===

This surface was maintained until 1791, when the French Revolution affected the temporal territories of the Papacy as well as the Roman Church in general. In 1791 an election in Comtat Venaissin and Avignon was followed by occupation by Revolutionary France. Later, with the French invasion of Italy in 1796, the Legations (the Papal States&#x27; northern territories) were seized and became part of the Cisalpine Republic.

Two years later, French forces invaded the remaining area of the Papal States, and in February 1798 General Louis-Alexandre Berthier declared a Roman Republic. Pope Pius VI fled from Rome to Siena and died in exile in Valence in 1799. 
In October 1799, Neapolitan troops under King Ferdinant invaded the newfound republic and restored Papal States, ending the republic. The French quickly drove the Neapolitans out and reoccupied the Papal States, but didn&#x27;t bother restoring the republic, as they continued their invasion to Naples, where they established another republic. In June 1800, French Consulate formally concluded the occupation and restored the Papal States, with the newly elected Pope Pius VII taking residence in Rome. Yet, in 1808 the French Empire under Napoleon invaded again, and this time on 17 May 1809 the remainder of the States of the Church were annexed to France, forming the &quot;départements&quot; of &quot;Tibre&quot; and &quot;Trasimène&quot;.

Following the fall of the First French Empire in 1814, the Congress of Vienna formally restored the Italian territories of the Papal States, but not the Comtat Venaissin or Avignon, to Vatican control.

Upon restitution of sovereignty to the Papal States, Pius VII decided to abolish feudalism, transforming all the noble titles (temporarily abolished during the Napoleonic occupation) into honorifics disconnected from territorial privileges. In 1853, Pius IX put an end to the centuries-old duality between the Papal nobility and the Roman baronial families by equating the civic patriciate of the city of Rome with the nobility created by the Pope.

From 1814 until the death of Pope Gregory XVI in 1846, the popes followed a reactionary policy in the Papal States. For instance, the city of Rome maintained the last Jewish ghetto in Western Europe.

===Italian unification===

Italian nationalism had been stoked during the Napoleonic period but dashed by the settlement of the Congress of Vienna (1814–15), which sought to restore the pre-Napoleonic conditions: most of northern Italy was under the rule of junior branches of the Habsburgs and the Bourbons. The Papal States in central Italy and the Bourbon Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in the south were both restored. Popular opposition to the reconstituted and corrupt clerical government led to revolts in 1830 and in 1848, which were suppressed by the intervention of the Austrian army.

The nationalist and liberal revolutions of 1848 affected much of Europe. In February 1849 a Roman Republic was declared, and the hitherto liberally-inclined Pope Pius IX had to flee the city. The revolution was suppressed with French help in 1849 and Pius IX switched to a conservative line of government. Until his return to Rome in 1850, the Papal States were governed by a group of cardinals known as the Red Triumvirate.

As a result of the Second Italian War of Independence, Piedmont-Sardinia annexed Lombardy, while Giuseppe Garibaldi overthrew the Bourbon monarchy in the south. Afraid that Garibaldi would set up a republican government, the Piedmontese government petitioned French Emperor Napoleon III for permission to send troops through the Papal States to gain control of the south. This was granted on the condition that Rome be left undisturbed.

In 1860, with much of the region already in rebellion against Papal rule, Piedmont-Sardinia invaded and conquered the eastern two-thirds of the Papal States, cementing its hold on the south. Bologna, Ferrara, Umbria, the Marches, Benevento and Pontecorvo were all formally annexed by November of the same year. While considerably reduced, the Papal States nevertheless still covered the Latium and large areas northwest of Rome.

A unified Kingdom of Italy was declared and in March 1861 the first Italian parliament, which met in Turin, the old capital of Piedmont, declared Rome the capital of the new kingdom. However, the Italian government could not take possession of the city because a French garrison in Rome protected Pope Pius IX.

===Italian invasion of Rome, 1870===

The opportunity for the Kingdom of Italy to eliminate the Papal States came in 1870; the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in July prompted Napoleon III to recall his garrison from Rome and the collapse of the Second French Empire at the Battle of Sedan deprived Rome of its French protector.

King Victor Emmanuel II at first aimed at a peaceful conquest of the city and proposed sending troops into Rome, under the guise of offering protection to the pope. When the pope refused, Italy declared war on 10 September 1870, and the Italian Army, commanded by General Raffaele Cadorna, crossed the frontier of the papal territory on September 11 and advanced slowly toward Rome.

The Italian Army reached the Aurelian Walls on September 19 and placed Rome under a state of siege. Although the Pope&#x27;s tiny army was incapable of defending the city, Pius IX ordered it to put up more than token resistance to emphasize that Italy was acquiring Rome by force and not consent. This incidentally served the purposes of the Italian State and gave rise to the myth of the Breach of Porta Pia, in reality, a tame affair involving a cannonade at close range that demolished a 1600-year-old wall in poor repair. The defence of Rome was not however bloodless, with 12 dead and 47 wounded amongst the Papal forces and 32 dead plus 145 wounded of the Italian troops.

Pope Pius IX ordered the commander of the Papal forces to limit the defence of the city in order to avoid bloodshed. The city was captured on 20 September 1870. Rome and what was left of the Papal States were annexed to the Kingdom of Italy as a result of a plebiscite the following October. This marked the definitive end of the Papal States.

Despite the fact that the traditionally Catholic powers did not come to the Pope&#x27;s aid, the papacy rejected the 1871 &quot;Law of Guarantees&quot; and any substantial accommodation with the Italian Kingdom, especially any proposal which required the Pope to become an Italian subject. Instead, the papacy confined itself (see Prisoner in the Vatican) to the Apostolic Palace and adjacent buildings in the loop of the ancient fortifications known as the Leonine City, on Vatican Hill. From there it maintained a number of features pertaining to sovereignty, such as diplomatic relations since in canon law these were inherent in the papacy.

In the 1920s, the papacy – then under Pius XI – renounced the bulk of the Papal States. The Lateran Treaty with Italy (then ruled by the National Fascist Party under Benito Mussolini) was signed on 11 February 1929, creating the State of the Vatican City, forming the sovereign territory of the Holy See, which was also indemnified to some degree for loss of territory.

==Regional governors==
As the plural name Papal States indicates, the various regional components retained their identity under papal rule. The Pope was represented in each province by a governor, who bore one of a number of titles. These included &quot;papal legate&quot;, as in the former principality of Benevento, or at Bologna, in Romagna, and the March of Ancona; and &quot;papal delegate&quot;, as in the former Duchy of Pontecorvo and in the Campagne and Maritime Province. Other titles like &quot;Papal Vicar&quot;, &quot;Vicar General&quot;, and also several titles of nobility, such as &quot;count&quot; or even &quot;prince&quot; were used. However, throughout the history of the Papal States, many warlords and even bandit chieftains controlled cities and small duchies without having received any title from the Pope of the day.

==Papal military==

Historically the Papal States maintained military forces composed of volunteers, mercenaries (including Corsican Guard) and Catholic military orders. Between 1860 and 1870 the Papal Army (&quot;Esercito Pontificio&quot; in Italian) comprised two regiments of locally recruited Italian infantry, two Swiss regiments and a battalion of Irish volunteers, plus artillery and dragoons.
In 1861 an international Catholic volunteer corps, called Papal Zouaves after a kind of French colonial native Algerian infantry, and imitating their uniform type, was created. Predominantly made up of Dutch, French and Belgian volunteers, this corps saw service against Garibaldi&#x27;s Redshirts, Italian patriots, and finally the forces of the newly united Italy.

The Papal Army was disbanded in 1870, leaving only the Palatine Guard, which was itself disbanded on 14 September 1970 by Pope Paul VI; the Noble Guard, which also disbanded in 1970; and the Swiss Guard, which continues to serve both as a ceremonial unit at the Vatican and as the Pope&#x27;s protective force.

A small Papal Navy was also maintained, based at Civitavecchia on the west coast and Ancona on the east. With the fall of the Papal States in 1870, the last ships of the flotilla were sailed to France, where they were sold after the death of Pius IX.

<text>Christa Päffgen (; 16 October 1938 – 18 July 1988), known by her stage name Nico, was a German singer, songwriter, actress, and model.

Nico had roles in several films, including Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; (1960) and Andy Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Chelsea Girls&quot; (1966). At the insistence of Warhol, she sang lead on three songs of the Velvet Underground&#x27;s debut album &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; (1967). At the same time, she started a solo career and released &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot; (1967). Her friend Jim Morrison suggested that she start writing her own material. She then composed songs on a harmonium, not traditionally a rock instrument. John Cale of the Velvet Underground became her musical arranger and produced &quot;The Marble Index&quot; (1968), &quot;Desertshore&quot; (1970), &quot;The End...&quot; (1974) and other subsequent albums.

In the 1980s, Nico toured extensively in Europe, United States, Australia and Japan. After a concert in Berlin in June 1988, she went on holiday in Ibiza, where she died from a cerebral haemorrhage while cycling in extremely hot weather.

==Early life==
Nico was born Christa Päffgen in Cologne to Wilhelm and Margarete &quot;Grete&quot; Päffgen (née Schulz, 1910–1970). Wilhelm was born into the wealthy master brewer family dynasty in Cologne and was Catholic, while Grete came from a lower-class background and was Protestant. When Nico was two years old, she moved with her mother and grandfather to the Spreewald forest outside Berlin to escape the World War II bombardments of Cologne.

Her father was conscripted into the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; at the onset of the war, but there are several conflicting accounts as to when and how he died. According to biographer Richard Witts in his 1995 book &quot;Nico: The Life and Lies of an Icon&quot;, Wilhelm Päffgen was gravely wounded in 1942 after having been shot in the head by a French sniper. With no certainty that he would survive, his commanding officer, following standing orders, ended Päffgen&#x27;s life by gunshot. Another story is that he sustained head injuries that caused severe brain damage, and spent the rest of his life in a psychiatric institution. According to unproven rumours, he was variously said to have died in a concentration camp, or to have faded away as a result of shell shock.

In 1946, Nico and her mother relocated to downtown Berlin, where Grete worked as a seamstress. Nico attended school until the age of 13, and began selling lingerie in the exclusive department store KaDeWe, eventually getting modelling jobs in Berlin. At , and with chiseled features and pale skin, Nico rose to prominence as a fashion model when still a teenager.

==Career==

===Acting and modelling (1955–1964)===
Nico was discovered at 16 by photographer Herbert Tobias while both were working at a KaDeWe fashion show in Berlin. He gave her the name &quot;Nico&quot; after a man he had fallen in love with, filmmaker Nikos Papatakis, and she used it for the rest of her life. She moved to Paris and began working for &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Tempo&quot;, &quot;Vie Nuove&quot;, &quot;Mascotte Spettacolo&quot;, &quot;Camera&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, and other fashion magazines. Around this time, she dyed her brown hair blonde, later claiming she was inspired to do so by Ernest Hemingway. At age 17, she was contracted by Coco Chanel to promote their products, but she fled to New York City and abandoned the job. Through her travels, she learned to speak English, Spanish, and French.

In 1959 she had an uncredited speaking part in Mario Lanza&#x27;s last film &quot;For the First Time&quot;. In the same year she was invited to the set of Federico Fellini&#x27;s &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;, where she attracted the attention of the acclaimed director, who gave her a minor role in the film as herself. By that time, she was living in New York and taking acting classes with Lee Strasberg.

After a role in the 1961 Jean Paul Belmondo film &quot;A Man Named Rocca&quot;, she appeared as the cover model on jazz pianist Bill Evans&#x27; 1962 album, &quot;Moon Beams&quot;. After splitting her time between New York and Paris, she got the lead role in Jacques Poitrenaud&#x27;s &quot;Strip-Tease&quot; (1963). She recorded the title track, which was written by Serge Gainsbourg but not released until 2001, when it was included in the compilation &quot;Le Cinéma de Serge Gainsbourg&quot;.

===Early singing work===
In New York, Nico first met Greek filmmaker Nico Papatakis, whose name she had adopted as her stage name several years earlier. The two lived together between 1959 and 1961. After noticing her singing around the apartment, Papatakis asked her if she had ever considered a career in music and ended up enrolling her in her first singing lessons.

In 1965, Nico met the Rolling Stones guitarist Brian Jones and recorded her first single, &quot;I&#x27;m Not Sayin&#x27;&quot;, with the B-side &quot;The Last Mile&quot;, produced by Jimmy Page for Andrew Loog Oldham&#x27;s Immediate label. Actor Ben Carruthers introduced her to Bob Dylan in Paris that summer. In 1967, Nico recorded his song &quot;I&#x27;ll Keep It with Mine&quot; for her first album, &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot;.

===The Velvet Underground (1966–67)===
After being introduced by Brian Jones, she began working in New York with Andy Warhol and Paul Morrissey on their experimental films, including &quot;Chelsea Girls&quot;, &quot;The Closet&quot;, &quot;Sunset&quot; and &quot;Imitation of Christ&quot;. Warhol began managing the Velvet Underground, a New York City rock band and he proposed that the group take on Nico as a &quot;&quot;, an idea to which they consented, reluctantly for both personal and musical reasons.

The group became the centerpiece of Warhol&#x27;s &quot;Exploding Plastic Inevitable&quot;, a multimedia performance featuring music, lighting, film and dance. Nico sang lead vocals on three songs (&quot;Femme Fatale&quot;, &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Your Mirror&quot;), and backing vocal on &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;, on the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Velvet Underground &amp; Nico&quot; (1967). Reviewer Richard Goldstein describes Nico as &quot;half goddess, half icicle&quot; and writes that her Velvet Underground vocal &quot;sounds something like a cello getting up in the morning&quot;.
Nico&#x27;s tenure with the Velvet Underground was marked by personal and musical difficulties. Multi-instrumentalist John Cale wrote that Nico&#x27;s long dressing room preparations, and pre-performance ritual of burning a candle, often held up performances, which especially irritated songwriter Lou Reed. Nico&#x27;s partial deafness sometimes caused her to veer off key, for which she was ridiculed by other band members. The album became a classic, ranked 13th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, though it was poorly received at the time of its release.

===Early solo career (1967–1977)===
Immediately following her musical work with the Velvet Underground, Nico began work as a solo artist, performing regularly at The Dom in New York City. At these shows, she was accompanied by a revolving cast of guitarists, including members of the Velvet Underground, Tim Hardin, Tim Buckley, Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliott and Jackson Browne.

For her debut album, 1967&#x27;s &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot;, she recorded songs by Bob Dylan, Tim Hardin, and Jackson Browne, among others. Velvet Underground members Lou Reed, John Cale and Sterling Morrison contributed to the album, with Nico, Reed and Cale co-writing one song, &quot;It Was a Pleasure Then.&quot; &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot; is a traditional chamber-folk album, with strings and flute arrangements by producer Tom Wilson. Nico had little say in its production, and was disappointed with the result; she said in 1981: &quot;I still cannot listen to it, because everything I wanted for that record, they took it away. I asked for drums, they said no. I asked for more guitars, they said no. And I asked for simplicity, and they covered it in flutes! ... They added strings, and— I didn&#x27;t like them, but I could live with them. But the flute! The first time I heard the album, I cried and it was all because of the flute.&quot; In California, Nico spent time with Jim Morrison of the Doors, who encouraged her to write her own songs.

For &quot;The Marble Index&quot;, released in 1968, Nico wrote the lyrics and music. Nico&#x27;s harmonium anchored the accompaniment, while John Cale added an array of folk and classical instruments, and arranged the album. The harmonium became her signature instrument for the rest of her career. The album has a classical-cum-European folk sound. The album also marked a radical change in Nico&#x27;s appearance and image. She once again dyed her hair, this time from blonde to red, and began dressing mostly in black, a look that would be considered a visual prototype for the gothic rock scene that would emerge in subsequent years.

A promotional film for the song &quot;Evening of Light&quot; was filmed by Francois de Menil. This video featured the now red-haired Nico and Iggy Pop of the Stooges.

Returning to live performance in the early 1970s, Nico (accompanying herself on harmonium) gave concerts in Amsterdam as well as London, where she and John Cale opened for Pink Floyd. 1972 saw a one-off live reunion of Nico, Cale and Lou Reed at the Bataclan in Paris.
Nico released two more solo albums in the 1970s, &quot;Desertshore&quot; (1970) and &quot;The End...&quot; (1974). She wrote the music, sang, and played the harmonium. Cale produced and played most of the other instruments on both albums. &quot;The End...&quot; featured Brian Eno on synthesizer and Phil Manzanera on guitar, both from Roxy Music. She appeared at the Rainbow Theatre, in London, with Cale, Eno, and Kevin Ayers. The album &quot;June 1, 1974&quot; resulted from this concert. Nico performed a version of the Doors&#x27; &quot;The End&quot;, which was the catalyst for &quot;The End...&quot; later that year.

Between 1970 and 1979, Nico made about seven films with French director Philippe Garrel. She met Garrel in 1969 and contributed the song &quot;The Falconer&quot; to his film &quot;Le Lit de la Vierge&quot;. Soon after, she was living with Garrel and became a central figure in his cinematic and personal circles. Nico&#x27;s first acting appearance with Garrel occurred in his 1972 film, &quot;La Cicatrice Intérieure&quot;. Nico also supplied the music for this film and collaborated closely with the director. She also appeared in the Garrel films &quot;Athanor&quot; (1972); the silent Jean Seberg feature &quot;Les Hautes Solitudes&quot;, released in 1974; &quot;Un ange passe&quot; (1975); &quot;Le Berceau de cristal&quot; (1976), starring Pierre Clémenti, Nico and Anita Pallenberg; and &quot;Voyage au jardin des morts&quot; (1978). His 1991 film &quot;J&#x27;entends Plus la Guitare&quot; is dedicated to Nico.

On 13 December 1974, Nico opened for Tangerine Dream&#x27;s concert at Reims Cathedral in Reims, France. Around this time, Nico became involved with Berliner musician Lutz Ulbrich, guitarist for Ash Ra Tempel. Ulbrich would accompany Nico on guitar at many of her subsequent concerts through the rest of the decade. Also in this time period, Nico let her hair return to its natural brown color but continued wearing mostly black. This would be her public image from then on. Nico and Island Records allegedly had many disputes during this time, and in 1975 Island dropped her from their roster.

===Later solo career (1978–1988)===

In September 1978, Nico performed at the Canet Roc &#x27;78 festival in Spain. Also performing at this event were Blondie, Kevin Ayers, and Ultravox. She made a vocal contribution to Neuronium&#x27;s second album, &quot;Vuelo Químico&quot;, as she was at the studio, by chance, while it was being recorded in Barcelona in 1978 by Michel Huygen, Carlos Guirao and Albert Gimenez. She read excerpts from &quot;Ulalume&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe. She said that the music deeply moved her, so she could not help but make a contribution. During the same year, Nico briefly toured as supporting act for Siouxsie and the Banshees, one of many post-punk bands who namechecked her. In Paris, Patti Smith bought a new harmonium for Nico after her original was stolen.

Nico returned to New York in 1979 where her comeback concert at CBGB (accompanied by John Cale and Lutz Ulbrich) was reviewed positively in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. She began playing regularly at the Squat Theatre and other venues with Jim Tisdall accompanying her on harp and Gittler guitar. They played together on a sold-out tour of twelve cities in the East and Midwest. At some shows, she was accompanied on guitar by Cheetah Chrome (the Dead Boys).

In France, Nico was introduced to photographer Antoine Giacomoni. Giacomoni&#x27;s photos of Nico would be used for her next album, and would eventually be featured in a book (&quot;Nico: Photographies&quot;, Horizon Illimite, Paris, 2002). Through Antoine Giacomoni, she met Corsican bassist Philippe Quilichini. Nico recorded her next studio album, &quot;Drama of Exile&quot;, in 1981. produced by Philippe Quilichini. Mahamad Hadi aka Mad Sheer Khan played oriental rock guitar and wrote all the oriental production. It was a departure from her earlier work with John Cale, featuring a mixture of rock and Middle Eastern arrangements. For this album, in addition to originals like &quot;Genghis Khan&quot; and &quot;Sixty Forty&quot;, Nico recorded covers of the Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Waiting for the Man&quot; and David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Heroes&quot;. &quot;Drama of Exile&quot; was released twice, in two different versions, the second appearing in 1983.

After relocating to Manchester, England, in the early 1980s, Nico acquired a manager, Factory Records executive and promoter Alan Wise, and began working with a variety of backing bands for her many live performances. These bands chronologically included Blue Orchids, the Bedlamites and the Faction.

In 1981, Nico released the Philippe Quilichini-produced single &quot;Saeta&quot;/&quot;Vegas&quot; on Flicknife Records. The following year saw another single, &quot;Procession&quot;, produced by Martin Hannett and featuring the Invisible Girls. Included on the &quot;Procession&quot; single was a new version of the Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot;.

Nico toured in 1982 with post-punk band Blue Orchids as her backing band. At the time, her work impacted the emerging gothic rock scene. At Salford University in 1982, she joined Bauhaus for a performance of &quot;I&#x27;m Waiting for the Man&quot;. That same year, Nico&#x27;s supporting acts included the Sisters of Mercy and Gene Loves Jezebel. In September 1982, Nico performed at the Deeside Leisure Centre for the Futurama Festival. The line-up for this show also included the Damned, Dead or Alive, Southern Death Cult, Danse Society and the Membranes. After the end of her work with the Blue Orchids, she hired musical arranger James Young and his band the Faction for her concerts.

The live compilations &quot;1982 Tour Diary&quot; and &quot;En Personne En Europe&quot; were released in November 1982 on the 1/2 Records cassette label in France; the ROIR cassette label reissued the former under the revised title &quot;Do Or Die!&quot; in 1983. These releases were followed by more live performances throughout Europe over the next few years.

She recorded her final solo album, &quot;Camera Obscura&quot;, in 1985, with the Faction (James Young and Graham &quot;Dids&quot; Dowdall). Produced by John Cale, it featured Nico&#x27;s version of the Richard Rodgers/Lorenz Hart song &quot;My Funny Valentine&quot;. The album&#x27;s closing song was an updated version of &quot;König&quot;, which she had previously recorded for &quot;La cicatrice interieure&quot;. This was the only song on the album to feature only Nico&#x27;s voice and harmonium. A music video for &quot;My Heart Is Empty&quot; was filmed at The Fridge in Brixton.

The next few years saw frequent live performances by Nico, with tours of Europe, Japan and Australia (usually with the Faction or the Bedlamites). A number of Nico&#x27;s performances towards the end of her life were recorded and released, including 1982&#x27;s &quot;Heroine&quot;, &quot;Nico in Tokyo&quot;, and &quot;Behind the Iron Curtain&quot;.

In March 1988, she and Young hired new guitarist Henry Olsen: together, they composed new songs to be premiered at a festival organized by Lutz Ulbrich at the Berlin Planetarium in June. Nico was then inspired by Egyptian music and Egyptian singer and diva Oum Kalthoum. Young stated that the new material was &quot;good enough to be a springboard to a new record&quot; with an Egyptian orchestra. The Berlin concert ended with a song from &quot;The End...&quot;, &quot;You Forget to Answer&quot;.

A duet called &quot;Your Kisses Burn&quot; with singer Marc Almond was her last studio recording (about a month before her death). It was released a few months after her death on Almond&#x27;s album &quot;The Stars We Are&quot;. The recording of the 1988 Berlin concert, was later released with the title &quot;Nico&#x27;s Last Concert: Fata Morgana&quot;.

==Personal life==
On 11 August 1962, she gave birth to her son, Christian Aaron Boulogne, whom she called Ari. She was living with Nicos Papatakis in 1962 but told him that Alain Delon was the father of her child. Delon always denied it, and it has not been verified. Unable to raise her child, she left Ari to be raised by Delon&#x27;s mother and his stepfather. Ari became a photographer and actor. He died of a heroin overdose, aged 60, in Paris in 2023.

Nico saw herself as part of a tradition of bohemian artists, which she traced back to the Romanticism of the early 19th century. She led a nomadic life, living in different countries. Apart from Germany, where she grew up, and Spain, where she died, Nico lived in Italy and France in the 1950s, spent most of the 1960s in the USA, and lived in London in the early 1960s and again in the 1980s, when she moved between London and Manchester.

In 1965 she became pregnant during a three month affair with Brian Jones but decided to have an abortion in London that same year. This event prompted her to seek out a closer relationship with her son Ari.

Nico was a heroin addict for over 15 years. In the book &quot;Songs They Never Play on the Radio&quot;, James Young, a member of her band in the 1980s, recalls many examples of her troubling behaviour due to her &quot;overwhelming&quot; addiction – and that Nico claimed never to have taken the drug while in the Velvets/Factory scene but only began using during her relationship with French film director Philippe Garrel in the 1970s.

The final years of her life were mainly spent in the Prestwich and Salford areas of Greater Manchester. Although she was still struggling with addiction, she became interested in music again. For a few months in the 1980s, she shared an apartment in Brixton, London, with punk poet John Cooper Clarke but not as a couple.

In his autobiography, musician Cheetah Chrome depicted his friendship with a strung-out Nico in the 1980s and their mutual dependency. Shortly before her death, Nico stopped using heroin and began methadone replacement therapy as well as a regimen of bicycle exercise and healthy eating.

Nico&#x27;s friend Danny Fields, the American journalist who helped her sign to Elektra Records, described her as &quot;Nazi-esque&quot;, saying, &quot;Every once in a while there&#x27;d be something about Jews and I&#x27;d be, &#x27;But Nico, I&#x27;m Jewish,&#x27; and she was like &#x27;Yes, yes, I don&#x27;t mean you.&#x27;&quot; According to Fields, in the early 1970s, Nico attacked a mixed-race woman at the Chelsea Hotel with a smashed wine glass, sticking it in her eye while saying, &quot;I hate black people.&quot; Island Records dropped Nico after she told an interviewer that she did not like &quot;Negroes&quot; and that they had &quot;features like animals&quot;. Nico said she had been raped at the age of thirteen by a black American soldier who had been court-martialed and executed; the biographer Richard Witts could find no record of this, even when similar incidents were &quot;assiduously documented&quot;, while biographer Jennifer Otter Bickerdike uncovered personal documents that support the story. According to Witts, Nico had misogynistic tendencies, describing women as poison.

In 2019, Nigel Bagley, Nico&#x27;s co-manager and promoter in Manchester, said he never saw Nico express racist views, and that she lived in a multicultural city and was friendly with their American-Jamaican doorman. Her drummer, Graham Dowdall, noted that Nico had used Indian instruments and worked with north Africans. He said she was &quot;certainly capable of very casual racism&quot; about her promoter, Alan Wise, who was Jewish, but that this was her way of &quot;having a go&quot; at him.

==Death==

On 18 July 1988, during a holiday with Ari on the Spanish island of Ibiza, Nico hit her head when she fell off her bicycle. A passing taxi driver found her unconscious, but had difficulty getting her admitted to local hospitals. She was misdiagnosed as suffering from heat exposure and was declared dead at 20:00. X-rays later revealed a severe cerebral hemorrhage as the cause of death. Her son later said of the incident:

Nico&#x27;s cremated remains are buried in her mother&#x27;s plot in Grunewald, a forest cemetery in Berlin. Friends played a tape of &quot;Mütterlein&quot;, a song from &quot;Desertshore&quot;, at her funeral.

==Legacy==
Nico directly inspired many musicians, including Siouxsie and the Banshees, the Cure, Morrissey, Elliott Smith, and Björk. Siouxsie and the Banshees invited her as special guest on their first major UK tour in 1978; they also later covered &quot;All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties&quot;. The Cure&#x27;s leader Robert Smith has cited &quot;Desertshore&quot; as one of his favourite records, as has Björk. Joy Division and New Order&#x27;s Peter Hook cited &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot; as one of his favourite albums. Bauhaus singer, Peter Murphy, considered that &quot;Nico recorded the first truly Gothic album, &quot;Marble lndex&quot; or &quot;The End&quot;. Nico was Gothic, but she was Mary Shelley to everyone else&#x27;s Hammer Horror. They both did &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, but Nico&#x27;s was real.&quot; Morrissey cited Nico when asked to name artists who had a lasting influence on him: &quot;The royal three remain the same: the New York Dolls, Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, with Nico standing firm as first reserve.&quot; Morrissey also said of the song &quot;Innocent and Vain&quot;, &quot;This is my youth in one piece of music.&quot; Elliott Smith covered &quot;Chelsea Girls&quot; and &quot;These Days&quot; in Portland, Oregon in October 1999; he also cited &quot;The Marble Index&quot; as one of his perfect 2.45am albums. Marc Almond recorded a cover version of &quot;The Falconer&quot;: she was one of the &quot;things I was obsessed about at school&quot; due to her &quot;wonderful intriguing voice, icy and remote yet warm at the same time.&quot; Marianne Faithfull recorded &quot;Song For Nico&quot; on her LP &quot;Kissin&#x27; Time&quot; in 2002. Michael Gira also recorded an homonymous song for the Angels of Light album How I Loved You, and cited &quot;Desertshore&quot; and &quot;The Marble Index&quot; among his favorite albums. Patti Smith did a concert tribute to Nico in 2014 in which she covered &quot;I Will Be Seven&quot;. Low wrote a song titled &quot;Those Girls (Song For Nico)&quot; and Neko Case covered &quot;Afraid&quot; in 2013. 

Two of Nico&#x27;s songs from &quot;Chelsea Girl&quot;, &quot;The Fairest of the Seasons&quot; and &quot;These Days&quot;, both written by Jackson Browne, were featured in Wes Anderson&#x27;s film &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot;.

Several biographical works on Nico have appeared, both in print and film. The first, in 1992, was &quot;Songs They Never Play on the Radio&quot;, a book by James Young that draws on his association with Nico in her last years. In 1993, &quot;Nico: The Life and Lies of an Icon&quot; by musicologist Richard Witts covered Nico&#x27;s entire life and career. The 1995 documentary &quot;Nico Icon&quot; by Susanne Ofteringer examined the many facets of Nico&#x27;s life with contributions from people who knew her, including her colleagues Reed and Cale. In 2015, Lutz Graf-Ulbrich, Nico&#x27;s former partner and accompanist in the late 1970s, published &quot;Nico: In the Shadow of the Moon Goddess&quot;, an account of his time with Nico. In the 2018 biopic &quot;Nico, 1988&quot; directed by Susanna Nicchiarelli, Trine Dyrholm portrays Nico on a journey across Europe during her last tour.

In 2019, Manchester International Festival put on a production called &quot;The Nico Project&quot;. It was a theatrical re-telling of Nico&#x27;s 1968 album &quot;The Marble Index&quot; starring Maxine Peake.

===Tributes===
Several concerts to honour Nico&#x27;s career were organized over the years with multiple singers revisiting her repertoire. In 1981 Texas punk band Really Red released an original song in tribute to Nico. In 2005, alternative rock band Anberlin released their second studio album, Never Take Friendship Personal, which includes the song &quot;Dance, Dance Christa Päffgen&quot;, inspired by Nico, whose given name was Christa Päffgen. The song references her struggle with drugs and unrelated death. Two Nico tribute concerts took place in Europe in the autumn of 2008 to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Nico&#x27;s birth and the 20th anniversary of her death. On 11 October 2008, John Cale, James Dean Bradfield (of Manic Street Preachers), Fyfe Dangerfield of the Guillemots, Mark Linkous (of Sparklehorse), Peter Murphy (of Bauhaus), Lisa Gerrard of Dead Can Dance, and Mark Lanegan appeared on stage at the Royal Festival Hall in London. On 17 October 2008 at the Volksbuehne in Berlin, Nico&#x27;s ex-boyfriend Lutz Ulbrich, who was her musical collaborator in the late 1970s, presented another tribute concert, which featured Marianne Rosenberg, Soap&amp;Skin, Marianne Enzensberger, and James Young, the keyboardist from The Faction, Nico&#x27;s last band.

Shearwater&#x27;s 2006 album &quot;Palo Santo&quot; was dedicated to Nico, and was loosely based on her life.

Performance artist Tammy Faye Starlite (Tammy Lang) enjoyed success in 2011 with her one-woman show &quot;Nico: Chelsea Mädchen&quot;, in which she impersonated the singer and delivered spoken material based on an interview Nico gave in the mid-Eighties, during an Australian tour.

In 2012, X-TG (featuring members of industrial band Throbbing Gristle) released a re-interpretation of the &quot;Desertshore&quot; album.

In January 2013, John Cale organized a tribute &quot;A Life Along the Borderline&quot; at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York City. Performers included Cale, Kim Gordon with Bill Nace, Sharon Van Etten, Meshell Ndegeocello, Stephin Merritt, Peaches, Alison Mosshart, Joan As Police Woman, Greg Dulli, Yeasayer, and Mercury Rev.

<text>The Hutu (), also known as the Abahutu, are a Bantu ethnic group which is native to the African Great Lakes region. They mainly live in Rwanda, Burundi, and Uganda where they form one of the principal ethnic groups alongside the Tutsi and the Great Lakes Twa.

==Demographics==

The Hutu is the largest of the three main population divisions in Burundi and Rwanda. Prior to 2017, the CIA World Factbook stated that 84% of Rwandans and 85% of Burundians are Hutu, with Tutsis being the second largest ethnic group at 15% and 14% of residents of Rwanda and Burundi, respectively. However, these figures were omitted in 2017 and no new figures have been published since then.

The Twa pygmies, the smallest of the two countries&#x27; principal populations, share language and culture with the Hutu and Tutsi. They are distinguished by a considerably shorter stature.

==Etymology==
The idea that Hutu is etymologically derived from a word that signifies slave was advanced by Ernest Viaene (1910, p.1047) and contradicted by Réné Bourgeois, who suggested that it originally meant &quot;lords&quot; in relation to the subordinate Twa pygmies. Réné Bourgeois reported that among the Mongo people of the DRC, Bantu people governing on the local Twa were called &quot;Bahoto&quot; or &quot;Bawoto&quot;, terms cognate to the “Bahutu” of Rwanda and Burundi, and which meant “lords” in the local language (not serfs) because they governed over the Pygmies.

== Origins ==
 
The Hutu are believed to have first emigrated to the Great Lake region from Central Africa in the great Bantu expansion. Various theories have emerged to explain the purported physical differences between them and their fellow Bantu-speaking neighbors, the Tutsi. The Tutsi were pastoralists and are believed to have established aristocratic control over the sedentary Hutu and Twa. Through intermarriage with the Hutu, the Tutsi were gradually assimilated, culturally, linguistically, and racially.

Others suggest that the two groups are related but not identical, and they also suggest that the differences between them were exacerbated by Europeans, or they were exacerbated by a gradual, natural split, as those who owned cattle became known as the Tutsi and those who did not own cattle became known as the Hutu. Mahmood Mamdani states that the Belgian colonial power designated people as Tutsi or Hutu on the basis of cattle ownership, physical measurements and church records.

The debate over the ethnic origins of the Hutu and Tutsi within Rwandan politics predates the Rwandan genocide, and it continues to the present day, with the government of Rwanda no longer using the distinction.

==Genetics==
===Y-DNA (paternal lineages)===
Modern-day genetic studies of the Y-chromosome suggest that the Hutu, like the Tutsi, are largely of Bantu extraction (83% E1b1a, 8% E2). Paternal genetic influences associated with the Horn of Africa and North Africa are few (3% E1b1b and 1% R1b), and are ascribed to much earlier inhabitants who were assimilated. However, the Hutu have considerably fewer Nilo-Saharan paternal lineages (4.3% B) than the Tutsi (14.9% B).

=== Autosomal DNA (overall ancestry) ===

In general, the Hutu appear to share a close genetic kinship with neighboring Bantu populations, particularly the Tutsi. However, it is unclear whether this similarity is primarily due to extensive genetic exchanges between these communities through intermarriage or whether it ultimately stems from common origins:

[...] generations of gene flow obliterated whatever clear-cut physical distinctions may have once existed between these two Bantu peoples – renowned to be height, body build, and facial features. With a spectrum of physical variation in the peoples, Belgian authorities legally mandated ethnic affiliation in the 1920s, based on economic criteria. Formal and discrete social divisions were consequently imposed upon ambiguous biological distinctions. To some extent, the permeability of these categories in the intervening decades helped to reify the biological distinctions, generating a taller elite and a shorter underclass, but with little relation to the gene pools that had existed a few centuries ago. The social categories are thus real, but there is little if any detectable genetic differentiation between Hutu and Tutsi.

Tishkoff et al. (2009) found their mixed Hutu and Tutsi samples from Rwanda to be predominately of Bantu origin, with minor gene flow from Afro-Asiatic communities (17.7% Afro-Asiatic genes found in the mixed Hutu–Tutsi population).

==Language==
Hutus speak Rwanda-Rundi as their native tongue, which is a member of the Bantu subgroup of the Niger–Congo language family. Rwanda-Rundi is subdivided into the Kinyarwanda and Kirundi dialects, which have been standardized as official languages of Rwanda and Burundi, respectively. It is also spoken as a mother tongue by the Tutsi and Twa.

Additionally, a small portion of Hutu speak French, the other official language of Rwanda and Burundi, as a lingua franca, although the population is dwindling given the poor relations between Rwanda and France.

==Post-colonial history==
The Belgian-sponsored Tutsi monarchy survived until 1959 when Kigeli V was exiled from the colony (then called Ruanda-Urundi). In Burundi, Tutsis, who are the minority, maintained control of the government and military. In Rwanda, the political power was transferred from the minority Tutsi to the majority Hutu.

In Rwanda, this led to the &quot;Social revolution&quot; and Hutu and Tutsis conflicts. Tens of thousands of Tutsis were killed, and many others fled to neighboring countries, such as Burundi, Uganda, and forming the Banyamulenge Tutsi ethnic group in the South Kivu region of the Belgian Congo. Later, exiled Tutsis from Burundi invaded Rwanda, prompting Rwanda to close its border to Burundi.

In Burundi, a campaign of genocide was conducted against the Hutu population in 1972, and an estimated 100,000 Hutus died. In 1993, Burundi&#x27;s first democratically elected president, Melchior Ndadaye, who was Hutu, was believed to be assassinated by Tutsi officers, as was the person constitutionally entitled to succeed him. This sparked a counter-genocide in Burundi between Hutu political structures and the Tutsi military, in which an estimated 500,000 Burundians died. There were many mass killings of Tutsis and moderate Hutus; these events were deemed to be a genocide by the United Nations International Commission of Inquiry for Burundi.

While Tutsis remained in control of Burundi, the conflict resulted in genocide in Rwanda as well. A Tutsi rebel group, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, invaded Rwanda from Uganda, which started a civil war against Rwanda&#x27;s Hutu government in 1990. A peace agreement was signed, but violence erupted again, culminating in the Rwandan genocide of 1994, when Hutu extremists killed an estimated 800,000 Rwandans, mostly Tutsis.

About 30% of the Twa pygmy population of Rwanda were also killed by the Hutu extremists. At the same time, the Rwandan Patriotic Front took control of the country and is still the ruling party . Burundi is also currently governed by a former rebel group, the Hutu CNDD–FDD.

, violence between the Hutu and Tutsi had subsided, but the situation in both Rwanda and Burundi was still tense, and tens of thousands of Rwandans were still living outside the country (see Great Lakes refugee crisis).

<doc id="59538" wikidata="Q1945067" url="?curid=59538" title="Monomorphism">
<text>In the context of abstract algebra or universal algebra, a monomorphism is an injective homomorphism. A monomorphism from to is often denoted with the notation formula_1.

In the more general setting of category theory, a monomorphism (also called a monic morphism or a mono) is a left-cancellative morphism. That is, an arrow such that for all objects and all morphisms ,
: formula_2

Monomorphisms are a categorical generalization of injective functions (also called &quot;one-to-one functions&quot;); in some categories the notions coincide, but monomorphisms are more general, as in the examples below.

In the setting of posets intersections are idempotent: the intersection of anything with itself is itself. Monomorphisms generalize this property to arbitrary categories. A morphism is a monomorphism if it is idempotent with respect to pullbacks.

The categorical dual of a monomorphism is an epimorphism, that is, a monomorphism in a category &quot;C&quot; is an epimorphism in the dual category &quot;C&quot;op. Every section is a monomorphism, and every retraction is an epimorphism.

==Relation to invertibility==
Left-invertible morphisms are necessarily monic: if &quot;l&quot; is a left inverse for &quot;f&quot; (meaning &quot;l&quot; is a morphism and formula_3), then &quot;f&quot; is monic, as
: formula_4

A left-invertible morphism is called a split mono or a section. 

However, a monomorphism need not be left-invertible. For example, in the category Group of all groups and group homomorphisms among them, if &quot;H&quot; is a subgroup of &quot;G&quot; then the inclusion is always a monomorphism; but &quot;f&quot; has a left inverse in the category if and only if &quot;H&quot; has a normal complement in &quot;G&quot;. 

A morphism is monic if and only if the induced map , defined by for all morphisms , is injective for all objects &quot;Z&quot;.

==Examples==
Every morphism in a concrete category whose underlying function is injective is a monomorphism; in other words, if morphisms are actually functions between sets, then any morphism which is a one-to-one function will necessarily be a monomorphism in the categorical sense. In the category of sets the converse also holds, so the monomorphisms are exactly the injective morphisms. The converse also holds in most naturally occurring categories of algebras because of the existence of a free object on one generator. In particular, it is true in the categories of all groups, of all rings, and in any abelian category.

It is not true in general, however, that all monomorphisms must be injective in other categories; that is, there are settings in which the morphisms are functions between sets, but one can have a function that is not injective and yet is a monomorphism in the categorical sense. For example, in the category Div of divisible (abelian) groups and group homomorphisms between them there are monomorphisms that are not injective: consider, for example, the quotient map , where Q is the rationals under addition, Z the integers (also considered a group under addition), and Q/Z is the corresponding quotient group. This is not an injective map, as for example every integer is mapped to 0. Nevertheless, it is a monomorphism in this category. This follows from the implication , which we will now prove. If , where &quot;G&quot; is some divisible group, and , then . Now fix some . Without loss of generality, we may assume that (otherwise, choose −&quot;x&quot; instead). Then, letting , since &quot;G&quot; is a divisible group, there exists some such that , so . From this, and , it follows that

:formula_5

Since , it follows that , and thus . This says that , as desired. 

To go from that implication to the fact that &quot;q&quot; is a monomorphism, assume that for some morphisms , where &quot;G&quot; is some divisible group. Then , where . (Since , and , it follows that ). From the implication just proved, . Hence &quot;q&quot; is a monomorphism, as claimed.

==Properties==
*In a topos, every mono is an equalizer, and any map that is both monic and epic is an isomorphism.
*Every isomorphism is monic.

==Related concepts==
There are also useful concepts of &quot;regular monomorphism&quot;, &quot;extremal monomorphism&quot;, &quot;immediate monomorphism&quot;, &quot;strong monomorphism&quot;, and &quot;split monomorphism&quot;. 

* A monomorphism is said to be regular if it is an equalizer of some pair of parallel morphisms. 
* A monomorphism formula_6 is said to be extremal if in each representation formula_7, where formula_8 is an epimorphism, the morphism formula_8 is automatically an isomorphism. 
* A monomorphism formula_6 is said to be immediate if in each representation formula_11, where formula_12 is a monomorphism and formula_8 is an epimorphism, the morphism formula_8 is automatically an isomorphism.
* A monomorphism formula_15 is said to be strong if for any epimorphism formula_16 and any morphisms formula_17 and formula_18 such that formula_19, there exists a morphism formula_20 such that formula_21 and formula_22.
* A monomorphism formula_6 is said to be split if there exists a morphism formula_8 such that formula_25 (in this case formula_8 is called a left-sided inverse for formula_6).

==Terminology==

The companion terms &quot;monomorphism&quot; and &quot;epimorphism&quot; were originally introduced by Nicolas Bourbaki; Bourbaki uses &quot;monomorphism&quot; as shorthand for an injective function. Early category theorists believed that the correct generalization of injectivity to the context of categories was the cancellation property given above. While this is not exactly true for monic maps, it is very close, so this has caused little trouble, unlike the case of epimorphisms. Saunders Mac Lane attempted to make a distinction between what he called &quot;monomorphisms&quot;, which were maps in a concrete category whose underlying maps of sets were injective, and &quot;monic maps&quot;, which are monomorphisms in the categorical sense of the word. This distinction never came into general use.

Another name for monomorphism is &quot;extension&quot;, although this has other uses too.

<text>In category theory, an epimorphism is a morphism &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; that is right-cancellative in the sense that, for all objects &quot;Z&quot; and all morphisms ,
: formula_1

Epimorphisms are categorical analogues of onto or surjective functions (and in the category of sets the concept corresponds exactly to the surjective functions), but they may not exactly coincide in all contexts; for example, the inclusion formula_2 is a ring epimorphism. The dual of an epimorphism is a monomorphism (i.e. an epimorphism in a category &quot;C&quot; is a monomorphism in the dual category &quot;C&quot;op).

Many authors in abstract algebra and universal algebra define an epimorphism simply as an &quot;onto&quot; or surjective homomorphism. Every epimorphism in this algebraic sense is an epimorphism in the sense of category theory, but the converse is not true in all categories. In this article, the term &quot;epimorphism&quot; will be used in the sense of category theory given above. For more on this, see below.

==Examples==
Every morphism in a concrete category whose underlying function is surjective is an epimorphism. In many concrete categories of interest the converse is also true. For example, in the following categories, the epimorphisms are exactly those morphisms that are surjective on the underlying sets:
*Set: sets and functions. To prove that every epimorphism &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; in Set is surjective, we compose it with both the characteristic function &quot;g&quot;1: &quot;Y&quot; → {0,1} of the image &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) and the map &quot;g&quot;2: &quot;Y&quot; → {0,1} that is constant 1.
*Rel: sets with binary relations and relation-preserving functions. Here we can use the same proof as for Set, equipping {0,1} with the full relation {0,1}×{0,1}.
*Pos: partially ordered sets and monotone functions. If &quot;f&quot; : (&quot;X&quot;, ≤) → (&quot;Y&quot;, ≤) is not surjective, pick &quot;y&quot;0 in &quot;Y&quot; \ &quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) and let &quot;g&quot;1 : &quot;Y&quot; → {0,1} be the characteristic function of {&quot;y&quot; | &quot;y&quot;0 ≤ &quot;y&quot;} and &quot;g&quot;2 : &quot;Y&quot; → {0,1} the characteristic function of {&quot;y&quot; | &quot;y&quot;0 &lt; &quot;y&quot;}. These maps are monotone if {0,1} is given the standard ordering 0 &lt; 1.
*Grp: groups and group homomorphisms. The result that every epimorphism in Grp is surjective is due to Otto Schreier (he actually proved more, showing that every subgroup is an equalizer using the free product with one amalgamated subgroup); an elementary proof can be found in (Linderholm 1970).
*FinGrp: finite groups and group homomorphisms. Also due to Schreier; the proof given in (Linderholm 1970) establishes this case as well.
*Ab: abelian groups and group homomorphisms.
*&quot;K&quot;-Vect: vector spaces over a field &quot;K&quot; and &quot;K&quot;-linear transformations.
*Mod-&quot;R&quot;: right modules over a ring &quot;R&quot; and module homomorphisms. This generalizes the two previous examples; to prove that every epimorphism &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; in Mod-&quot;R&quot; is surjective, we compose it with both the canonical quotient map &quot;g&quot; 1: &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;/&quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) and the zero map &quot;g&quot;2: &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;/&quot;f&quot;(&quot;X&quot;).
*Top: topological spaces and continuous functions. To prove that every epimorphism in Top is surjective, we proceed exactly as in Set, giving {0,1} the indiscrete topology, which ensures that all considered maps are continuous.
*HComp: compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous functions. If &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; is not surjective, let &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;Y&quot; − &quot;fX&quot;. Since &quot;fX&quot; is closed, by Urysohn&#x27;s Lemma there is a continuous function &quot;g&quot;1:&quot;Y&quot; → [0,1] such that &quot;g&quot;1 is 0 on &quot;fX&quot; and 1 on &quot;y&quot;. We compose &quot;f&quot; with both &quot;g&quot;1 and the zero function &quot;g&quot;2: &quot;Y&quot; → [0,1].
However, there are also many concrete categories of interest where epimorphisms fail to be surjective. A few examples are:
*In the category of monoids, Mon, the inclusion map N → Z is a non-surjective epimorphism. To see this, suppose that &quot;g&quot;1 and &quot;g&quot;2 are two distinct maps from Z to some monoid &quot;M&quot;. Then for some &quot;n&quot; in Z, &quot;g&quot;1(&quot;n&quot;) ≠ &quot;g&quot;2(&quot;n&quot;), so &quot;g&quot;1(−&quot;n&quot;) ≠ &quot;g&quot;2(−&quot;n&quot;). Either &quot;n&quot; or −&quot;n&quot; is in N, so the restrictions of &quot;g&quot;1 and &quot;g&quot;2 to N are unequal.
*In the category of algebras over commutative ring R, take R[N] → R[Z], where R[G] is the monoid ring of the monoid G and the morphism is induced by the inclusion N → Z as in the previous example. This follows from the observation that 1 generates the algebra R[Z] (note that the unit in R[Z] is given by 0 of Z), and the inverse of the element represented by n in Z is just the element represented by −n. Thus any homomorphism from R[Z] is uniquely determined by its value on the element represented by 1 of Z.
*In the category of rings, Ring, the inclusion map Z → Q is a non-surjective epimorphism; to see this, note that any ring homomorphism on Q is determined entirely by its action on Z, similar to the previous example. A similar argument shows that the natural ring homomorphism from any commutative ring &quot;R&quot; to any one of its localizations is an epimorphism.
*In the category of commutative rings, a finitely generated homomorphism of rings &quot;f&quot; : &quot;R&quot; → &quot;S&quot; is an epimorphism if and only if for all prime ideals &quot;P&quot; of &quot;R&quot;, the ideal &quot;Q&quot; generated by &quot;f&quot;(&quot;P&quot;) is either &quot;S&quot; or is prime, and if &quot;Q&quot; is not &quot;S&quot;, the induced map Frac(&quot;R&quot;/&quot;P&quot;) → Frac(&quot;S&quot;/&quot;Q&quot;) is an isomorphism (EGA IV 17.2.6).
*In the category of Hausdorff spaces, Haus, the epimorphisms are precisely the continuous functions with dense images. For example, the inclusion map Q → R, is a non-surjective epimorphism.

The above differs from the case of monomorphisms where it is more frequently true that monomorphisms are precisely those whose underlying functions are injective.

As for examples of epimorphisms in non-concrete categories:
* If a monoid or ring is considered as a category with a single object (composition of morphisms given by multiplication), then the epimorphisms are precisely the right-cancellable elements.
* If a directed graph is considered as a category (objects are the vertices, morphisms are the paths, composition of morphisms is the concatenation of paths), then &quot;every&quot; morphism is an epimorphism.

==Properties==
Every isomorphism is an epimorphism; indeed only a right-sided inverse is needed: if there exists a morphism &quot;j&quot; : &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;X&quot; such that &quot;fj&quot; = id&quot;Y&quot;, then &quot;f&quot;: &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; is easily seen to be an epimorphism. A map with such a right-sided inverse is called a split epi. In a topos, a map that is both a monic morphism and an epimorphism is an isomorphism.

The composition of two epimorphisms is again an epimorphism. If the composition &quot;fg&quot; of two morphisms is an epimorphism, then &quot;f&quot; must be an epimorphism.

As some of the above examples show, the property of being an epimorphism is not determined by the morphism alone, but also by the category of context. If &quot;D&quot; is a subcategory of &quot;C&quot;, then every morphism in &quot;D&quot; that is an epimorphism when considered as a morphism in &quot;C&quot; is also an epimorphism in &quot;D&quot;. However the converse need not hold; the smaller category can (and often will) have more epimorphisms.

As for most concepts in category theory, epimorphisms are preserved under equivalences of categories: given an equivalence &quot;F&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot;, a morphism &quot;f&quot; is an epimorphism in the category &quot;C&quot; if and only if &quot;F&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) is an epimorphism in &quot;D&quot;. A duality between two categories turns epimorphisms into monomorphisms, and vice versa.

The definition of epimorphism may be reformulated to state that &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot; is an epimorphism if and only if the induced maps
:formula_3
are injective for every choice of &quot;Z&quot;. This in turn is equivalent to the induced natural transformation
:formula_4
being a monomorphism in the functor category Set&quot;C&quot;.

Every coequalizer is an epimorphism, a consequence of the uniqueness requirement in the definition of coequalizers. It follows in particular that every cokernel is an epimorphism. The converse, namely that every epimorphism be a coequalizer, is not true in all categories.

In many categories it is possible to write every morphism as the composition of an epimorphism followed by a monomorphism. For instance, given a group homomorphism &quot;f&quot; : &quot;G&quot; → &quot;H&quot;, we can define the group &quot;K&quot; = im(&quot;f&quot;) and then write &quot;f&quot; as the composition of the surjective homomorphism &quot;G&quot; → &quot;K&quot; that is defined like &quot;f&quot;, followed by the injective homomorphism &quot;K&quot; → &quot;H&quot; that sends each element to itself. Such a factorization of an arbitrary morphism into an epimorphism followed by a monomorphism can be carried out in all abelian categories and also in all the concrete categories mentioned above in (though not in all concrete categories).

== Related concepts ==
Among other useful concepts are &quot;regular epimorphism&quot;, &quot;extremal epimorphism&quot;, &quot;immediate epimorphism&quot;, &quot;strong epimorphism&quot;, and &quot;split epimorphism&quot;. 

* An epimorphism is said to be regular if it is a coequalizer of some pair of parallel morphisms. 
* An epimorphism formula_5 is said to be extremal if in each representation formula_6, where formula_7 is a monomorphism, the morphism formula_7 is automatically an isomorphism. 
* An epimorphism formula_5 is said to be immediate if in each representation formula_10, where formula_7 is a monomorphism and formula_12 is an epimorphism, the morphism formula_7 is automatically an isomorphism.
* An epimorphism formula_14 is said to be strong if for any monomorphism formula_15 and any morphisms formula_16 and formula_17 such that formula_18, there exists a morphism formula_19 such that formula_20 and formula_21.
* An epimorphism formula_5 is said to be split if there exists a morphism formula_7 such that formula_24 (in this case formula_7 is called a right-sided inverse for formula_5).

There is also the notion of homological epimorphism in ring theory. A morphism &quot;f&quot;: &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; of rings is a homological epimorphism if it is an epimorphism and it induces a full and faithful functor on derived categories:
D(&quot;f&quot;) : D(&quot;B&quot;) → D(&quot;A&quot;).

A morphism that is both a monomorphism and an epimorphism is called a bimorphism. Every isomorphism is a bimorphism but the converse is not true in general. For example, the map from the half-open interval [0,1) to the unit circle S1 (thought of as a subspace of the complex plane) that sends &quot;x&quot; to exp(2πi&quot;x&quot;) (see Euler&#x27;s formula) is continuous and bijective but not a homeomorphism since the inverse map is not continuous at 1, so it is an instance of a bimorphism that is not an isomorphism in the category Top. Another example is the embedding Q → R in the category Haus; as noted above, it is a bimorphism, but it is not bijective and therefore not an isomorphism. Similarly, in the category of rings, the map Z → Q is a bimorphism but not an isomorphism.

Epimorphisms are used to define abstract quotient objects in general categories: two epimorphisms &quot;f&quot;1 : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;1 and &quot;f&quot;2 : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;2 are said to be &quot;equivalent&quot; if there exists an isomorphism &quot;j&quot; : &quot;Y&quot;1 → &quot;Y&quot;2 with &quot;j&quot; &quot;f&quot;1 = &quot;f&quot;2. This is an equivalence relation, and the equivalence classes are defined to be the quotient objects of &quot;X&quot;.

== Terminology ==
The companion terms &quot;epimorphism&quot; and &quot;monomorphism&quot; were first introduced by Bourbaki. Bourbaki uses &quot;epimorphism&quot; as shorthand for a surjective function. Early category theorists believed that epimorphisms were the correct analogue of surjections in an arbitrary category, similar to how monomorphisms are very nearly an exact analogue of injections. Unfortunately this is incorrect; strong or regular epimorphisms behave much more closely to surjections than ordinary epimorphisms. Saunders Mac Lane attempted to create a distinction between &quot;epimorphisms&quot;, which were maps in a concrete category whose underlying set maps were surjective, and &quot;epic morphisms&quot;, which are epimorphisms in the modern sense. However, this distinction never caught on.

It is a common mistake to believe that epimorphisms are either identical to surjections or that they are a better concept. Unfortunately this is rarely the case; epimorphisms can be very mysterious and have unexpected behavior. It is very difficult, for example, to classify all the epimorphisms of rings. In general, epimorphisms are their own unique concept, related to surjections but fundamentally different.

<text>Vajrayāna (; &#x27;vajra vehicle&#x27;), also known as Mantrayāna (&#x27;mantra vehicle&#x27;), Guhyamantrayāna (&#x27;secret mantra vehicle&#x27;), Tantrayāna (&#x27;tantra vehicle&#x27;), Tantric Buddhism, and Esoteric Buddhism, is a tradition within Buddhism that emphasizes esoteric practices and rituals aimed at rapid spiritual awakening. Emerging between the 5th and 7th centuries CE in medieval India, Vajrayāna incorporates a range of techniques, including the use of mantras (sacred sounds), dhāraṇīs (mnemonic codes), mudrās (symbolic hand gestures), mandalas (spiritual diagrams), and the visualization of deities and Buddhas. These practices are designed to transform ordinary experiences into paths toward enlightenment, often by engaging with aspects of desire and aversion in a ritualized context. 

A distinctive feature of Vajrayāna is its emphasis on esoteric transmission, where teachings are passed directly from teacher (guru or vajrācārya) to student through initiation ceremonies. Tradition asserts that these teachings have been passed down through an unbroken lineage going back to the historical Buddha (), sometimes via other Buddhas or bodhisattvas (e.g. Vajrapani). This lineage-based transmission ensures the preservation of the teachings&#x27; purity and effectiveness. Practitioners often engage in deity yoga, a meditative practice where one visualizes oneself as a deity embodying enlightened qualities to transform one&#x27;s perception of reality. The tradition also acknowledges the role of feminine energy, venerating female Buddhas and ḍākiṇīs (spiritual beings), and sometimes incorporates practices that challenge conventional norms to transcend dualistic thinking. 

Vajrayāna has given rise to various sub-traditions across Asia. In Tibet, it evolved into Tibetan Buddhism, which became the dominant spiritual tradition, integrating local beliefs and practices. In Japan, it influenced Shingon Buddhism, established by Kūkai, emphasizing the use of mantras and rituals. Chinese Esoteric Buddhism also emerged, blending Vajrayāna practices with existing Chinese Buddhist traditions. Each of these traditions adapted Vajrayāna principles to its cultural context while maintaining core esoteric practices aimed at achieving enlightenment.

Central to Vajrayāna symbolism is the vajra, a ritual implement representing indestructibility and irresistible force, embodying the union of wisdom and compassion. Practitioners often use the vajra in conjunction with a bell during rituals, symbolizing the integration of male and female principles. The tradition also employs rich visual imagery, including complex mandalas and depictions of wrathful deities that serve as meditation aids to help practitioners internalize spiritual concepts and confront inner obstacles on the path to enlightenment.

== Terminology ==
In India, the initial term was Mantranāya (Path of Mantras), and Mantrayāna (Mantra Vehicle). Later, other terms were adopted, like Vajrayāna.

In Tibetan Buddhism practiced in the Himalayan regions of India, Nepal, and Bhutan, Buddhist Tantra is most often termed &quot;Vajrayāna&quot; (Tib. རྡོ་རྗེ་ཐེག་པ་, &quot;dorje tekpa&quot;, Wyl. &quot;rdo rje theg pa&quot;) and &quot;Secret mantra&quot; (Skt. &quot;Guhyamantra&quot;, Tib. གསང་སྔགས་, &quot;sang ngak&quot;, Wyl. &quot;gsang sngags&quot;). The vajra is a mythical weapon associated with Indra that was said to be indestructible and unbreakable (like a diamond) and extremely powerful (like thunder). Thus, the term is variously translated as Diamond Vehicle, Thunderbolt Vehicle, Indestructible Vehicle and so on.

In Chinese Esoteric Buddhism it is generally known by terms such as &quot;Zhēnyán&quot; (Chinese: 真言, literally &quot;true word&quot;, referring to mantra), &quot;Tángmì&quot; or &quot;Hanmì&quot; (唐密 - 漢密, &quot;Tang Esotericism&quot; or &quot;Han Esotericism&quot;)&quot;, Mìzōng&quot; (密宗, &quot;Esoteric Sect&quot;), or &quot;Mìjiao&quot; (Chinese: 密教; Esoteric Teaching). The Chinese term &quot;mì&quot; 密 (&quot;secret, esoteric&quot;) is a translation of the Sanskrit term &quot;Guhya&quot; (&quot;secret, hidden, profound, abstruse&quot;).

In Japan, Buddhist esotericism is known as or by the term Shingon (a Japanese rendering of &quot;Zhēnyán&quot;), which also refers to a specific school of .

The term &quot;Esoteric Buddhism&quot; is first used by Western occultist writers, such as Helena Blavatsky and Alfred Percy Sinnett, to describe theosophical doctrines passed down from &quot;supposedly initiated Buddhist masters.&quot;

According to David B. Gray, Vajrayana originated from pre-existing Tantric traditions, also known as &#x27;Tantrism&#x27;, which emerged within Hinduism during the first millennium CE. These early Hindu tantric practices had a profound influence on South Asian Mahāyāna Buddhism, leading to the development of distinct Buddhist tantric traditions, which arose in the 7th century CE, rapidly spread across Southeast, East, and Central Asia, giving rise to distinct traditions in East Asia and Tibet.

== History ==
===Mahasiddhas and the tantric movement===
Tantric Buddhism is associated with groups of wandering yogis called mahasiddhas in medieval India. According to Robert Thurman, these tantric figures thrived during the latter half of the first millennium CE. According to John Myrdhin Reynolds, the mahasiddhas date to the medieval period in North India and used methods radically different from those used in Buddhist monasteries, including practicing on charnel grounds.

Since Tantra focuses on the transformation of poisons into wisdom, the yogic circles came together in &quot;tantric feasts&quot;, often in sacred sites (&quot;pitha&quot;) and places (&quot;ksetra&quot;), which included dancing, singing, consort practices, and the ingestion of taboo substances like alcohol, urine, and meat. At least two of the mahasiddhas cited in the Buddhist literature are comparable with the Shaiva Nath saints (Gorakshanath and Matsyendranath) who practiced Hatha Yoga.

According to Schumann, a movement called &quot;Sahaja-siddhi&quot; developed in the 8th century in Bengal. It was dominated by long-haired, wandering mahasiddhas who openly challenged and ridiculed the Buddhist establishment. The mahasiddhas pursued &quot;siddhis&quot;, magical powers such as flight and extrasensory perception as well as spiritual liberation.

===Tantras===


Mahāyāna sutras contain &quot;proto-tantric&quot; material, such as the &quot;Gandavyuha&quot; and the &quot;Dasabhumika&quot;, which might have served as a central source of visual imagery for Tantric texts. Later Mahāyāna texts like the &quot;Kāraṇḍavyūha Sūtra&quot; (–5th century CE) expound the use of mantras such as Om mani padme hum, associated with vastly powerful beings like Avalokiteshvara. The Heart Sutra also includes a mantra.

Vajrayāna Buddhists developed a large corpus of texts, the Buddhist Tantras, some of which can be traced to at least the 7th century CE but might be older. The dating of the tantras is &quot;a difficult, indeed an impossible task&quot;, according to David Snellgrove.

Some of the earliest of these texts, Kriya tantras such as the &quot;Mañjuśrī-mūla-kalpa&quot; (), teach the use of mantras and dharanis for mostly worldly ends, including curing illness, controlling the weather and generating wealth. The &quot;Tattvasaṃgraha Tantra&quot; (&quot;Compendium of Principles&quot;), classed as a &quot;Yoga tantra&quot;, is one of the first Buddhist tantras that focuses on liberation as opposed to worldly goals. In another early tantra, the &quot;Vajrasekhara&quot; (Vajra Peak), the influential schema of the five Buddha families is developed. Other early tantras include the &quot;Mahāvairocana Abhisaṃbodhi&quot; and the &quot;Guhyasamāja&quot; (Gathering of Secrets).

The Guhyasamāja is a Mahayoga class of Tantra, which features forms of ritual practice considered &quot;left-hand&quot; (&quot;vamachara&quot;), such as use of taboo substances like alcohol, consort practices, and charnel ground practices that evoke wrathful deities. Ryujun Tajima divides the tantras into those that were &quot;a development of Mahāyānist thought&quot; and those &quot;formed in a rather popular mould toward the end of the eighth century and declining into the esoterism of the left&quot;. This &quot;left esoterism&quot; mainly refers to the Yogini tantras and later works associated with wandering yogis. This practice survives in Tibetan Buddhism, but it is rare for this to be done with an actual person. It is more common for a yogi or yogini to use an imagined consort (a buddhist tantric deity, i.e. a yidam).

Later tantras such as the &quot;Hevajra Tantra&quot; and the &quot;Chakrasamvara&quot; are classed as &quot;Yogini tantras&quot; and represent the final form of development of Indian Buddhist tantras in the ninth and tenth centuries. The &quot;Kalachakra tantra&quot; developed in the 10th century. It is farthest removed from the earlier Buddhist traditions, and incorporates concepts of messianism and astrology not present elsewhere in Buddhist literature.

According to Ronald M. Davidson, the rise of Tantric Buddhism was a response to the feudal structure of Indian society in the early medieval period (ca. 500–1200 CE), which saw kings divinized as manifestations of gods. Likewise, tantric yogis reconfigured their practice through the metaphor of being consecrated (&quot;abhiśeka&quot;) as the overlord (&quot;rājādhirāja&quot;) of a mandala palace of divine vassals, an imperial metaphor symbolizing kingly fortresses and their political power.

===Relationship to Shaivism===


The question of the origins of early Vajrayāna has been taken up by various scholars. David Seyfort Ruegg has suggested that Buddhist tantra employed various elements of a &quot;pan-Indian religious substrate&quot; that is not specifically Buddhist, Shaiva or Vaishnava.

According to Alexis Sanderson, various classes of Vajrayāna literature developed as a result of royal courts sponsoring both Buddhism and Shaivism. The relationship between the two systems can be seen in texts like the &quot;Mañjusrimulakalpa&quot;, which later came to be classified under Kriya tantra, and states that mantras taught in the Shaiva, Garuda, and Vaishnava tantras will be effective if applied by Buddhists since they were all taught originally by Manjushri.

Sanderson notes that the Vajrayāna Yogini tantras draw extensively from the material also present in Shaiva Bhairava tantras classified as &quot;Vidyapitha&quot;. Sanderson&#x27;s comparison of them shows similarity in &quot;ritual procedures, style of observance, deities, mantras, mandalas, ritual dress, Kapalika accouterments like skull bowls, specialized terminology, secret gestures, and secret jargons. There is even direct borrowing of passages from Shaiva texts.&quot; Sanderson gives numerous examples, such as the &quot;Guhyasiddhi&quot; of Padmavajra, a work associated with the Guhyasamaja tradition, which prescribes acting as a Shaiva guru and initiating members into Saiva Siddhanta scriptures and mandalas. Sanderson says that the Samvara tantra texts adopted the pitha list from the Shaiva text &quot;Tantrasadbhāva&quot;, introducing a copying error where a deity was mistaken for a place.

Davidson argues that Sanderson&#x27;s arguments for direct influence from Shaiva &quot;Vidyapitha&quot; texts are problematic because &quot;the chronology of the &quot;Vidyapitha&quot; tantras is by no means so well established&quot; and &quot;the available evidence suggests that received Saiva tantras come into evidence sometime in the ninth to tenth centuries with their affirmation by scholars like Abhinavagupta (c. 1000 c.e.)&quot; Davidson also notes that the list of pithas or sacred places is &quot;certainly not particularly Buddhist, nor are they uniquely Kapalika venues, despite their presence in lists employed by both traditions.&quot; He adds that, like the Buddhists, the Shaiva tradition was involved in the appropriation of Hindu and non-Hindu deities, texts, and traditions, an example being &quot;village or tribal divinities like Tumburu&quot;.

Davidson adds that Buddhists and Kapalikas as well as other ascetics (possibly Pasupatas) mingled and discussed their paths at various pilgrimage places and that there were conversions between the different groups. Thus he concludes:

The Buddhist-Kapalika connection is more complex than a simple process of religious imitation and textual appropriation. There can be no question that the Buddhist tantras were heavily influenced by Kapalika and other Saiva movements, but the influence was apparently mutual. Perhaps a more nuanced model would be that the various lines of transmission were locally flourishing and that in some areas they interacted, while in others they maintained concerted hostility. Thus the influence was both sustained and reciprocal, even in those places where Buddhist and Kapalika siddhas were in extreme antagonism.

Davidson also argues for the influence of non-Brahmanical and outcaste tribal religions and their feminine deities (such as Parnasabari and Janguli).

=== Traditional legends ===
According to several Buddhist tantras as well as traditional Tibetan Buddhist sources, the tantras and the Vajrayana was taught by the Buddha Shakyamuni, but only to some individuals. There are several stories and versions of how the tantras were disseminated. The &quot;Jñana Tilaka Tantra&quot;, for example, has the Buddha say that the tantras will be explained by the bodhisattva Vajrapani. One of the most famous legends is that of king Indrabhuti (also known as King Ja) of Oddiyana (a figure related to Vajrapani, in some cases said to be an emanation of him).

Other accounts attribute the revelation of Buddhist tantras to Padmasambhava, saying that he was an emanation of Amitabha and Avalokiteshvara and that the Buddha predicted his arrival. Some accounts also maintain Padmasambhava is a direct reincarnation of Buddha Shakyamuni.

==Philosophical background==
According to Alex Wayman, the philosophical view of the Vajrayana is based on Mahayana Buddhist philosophy, mainly the Madhyamaka and Yogacara schools. The major difference seen by Vajrayana thinkers is the superiority of Tantric methods, which provide a faster vehicle to liberation and contain many more skillful means (&quot;upaya&quot;).

The importance of the theory of emptiness is central to the Tantric Buddhist view and practice. The Buddhist emptiness view sees the world as fluid, without an ontological foundation or inherent existence, but ultimately a fabric of constructions. Because of this, tantric practice such as self-visualization as the deity is seen as no less real than everyday reality, but a process of transforming reality itself, including the practitioner&#x27;s identity as the deity. Stephan Beyer notes, &quot;In a universe where all events dissolve ontologically into Emptiness, the touching of Emptiness in the ritual is the re-creation of the world in actuality&quot;.

The doctrine of Buddha-nature, as outlined in the &quot;Ratnagotravibhāga&quot; of Asanga, was also an important theory that became the basis for Tantric views. As explained by the Tantric commentator Lilavajra, this &quot;intrinsic secret [behind] diverse manifestation&quot; is Tantra&#x27;s utmost secret and aim. According to Wayman, this &quot;Buddha embryo&quot; (&quot;tathāgatagarbha&quot;) is a &quot;non-dual, self-originated Wisdom (jnana), an effortless fount of good qualities&quot; that resides in the mindstream but is &quot;obscured by discursive thought&quot;. This doctrine is often associated with the idea of inherent or natural luminosity (Skt: &quot;prakṛti-prabhāsvara-citta&quot;, T. &quot;’od gsal gyi sems&quot;) or purity of the mind (&quot;prakrti-parisuddha&quot;).

Another fundamental theory of Tantric practice is that of transformation. In Vajrayāna, negative mental factors such as desire, hatred, greed, and pride are used as part of the path. As French Indologist Madeleine Biardeau notes, the tantric doctrine is &quot;an attempt to place &quot;kama&quot;, desire, in every meaning of the word, in the service of liberation.&quot; This view is outlined in the following passage from the &quot;Hevajra tantra&quot;:

Those things by which evil men are bound, others turn into means and gain thereby release from the bonds of existence. By passion the world is bound, by passion too it is released, but by heretical Buddhists this practice of reversals is not known.

The &quot;Hevajra&quot; further states that &quot;one knowing the nature of poison may dispel poison with poison.&quot; As Snellgrove notes, this idea is already present in Asanga&#x27;s &quot;Mahayana-sutra-alamkara-karika&quot; and therefore it is possible that he was aware of Tantric techniques, including sexual yoga.

According to Buddhist Tantra, there is no strict separation of the profane or &quot;samsara&quot; and the sacred or &quot;nirvana&quot;; rather, they exist in a continuum. Everyone is seen as containing the seed of enlightenment, which is covered over by defilements. Douglas Duckworth notes that Vajrayana sees Buddhahood not as something outside or an event in the future, but as immanently present.

Indian Tantric Buddhist philosophers such as Buddhaguhya, Vimalamitra, Ratnākaraśānti, and Abhayakaragupta continued the tradition of Buddhist philosophy and adapted it to their commentaries on the major Tantras. Abhayakaragupta&#x27;s &quot;Vajravali&quot; is a key source in the theory and practice of tantric rituals. After monks such as Vajrabodhi and Śubhakarasiṃha brought Tantra to Tang China (716 to 720), tantric philosophy continued to be developed in Chinese and Japanese by thinkers such as Yi Xing and Kūkai.

Likewise in Tibet, Sakya Pandita (1182–28 – 1251), as well as later thinkers like Longchenpa (1308–1364) expanded on these philosophies in their tantric commentaries and treatises. The status of the tantric view continued to be debated in medieval Tibet. Tibetan Buddhist Rongzom Chokyi Zangpo (1012–1088) held that the views of sutra such as Madhyamaka were inferior to that of tantra, which was based on basic purity of ultimate reality. Tsongkhapa (1357–1419), on the other hand, held that there is no difference between Vajrayāna and other forms of Mahayana in terms of &quot;prajnaparamita&quot; (perfection of insight) itself, only that Vajrayāna works faster.

==Place within Buddhist tradition==
Various classifications distinguish Vajrayāna from other Buddhist traditions. Vajrayāna can be seen as a third &quot;yana&quot;, next to Śrāvakayāna and Mahayana. Vajrayāna can be distinguished from the Sutrayana. The &quot;Sutrayana&quot; is the method of perfecting good qualities, where the &quot;Vajrayāna&quot; is the method of taking the intended outcome of Buddhahood as the path. Vajrayāna can also be distinguished from the paramitayana. According to this schema, Indian Mahayana revealed two vehicles (&quot;yana&quot;) or methods for attaining enlightenment: the method of the perfections (&quot;Paramitayana&quot;) and the method of mantra (&quot;Mantrayana&quot;).

The &quot;Paramitayana&quot; consists of the six or ten &quot;paramitas&quot;, of which the scriptures say that it takes three incalculable aeons to lead one to Buddhahood. The tantra literature, on the other hand, says that the &quot;Mantrayana&quot; leads one to Buddhahood in a single lifetime. According to the literature, the mantra is an easy path without the difficulties of the &quot;Paramitayana&quot;. &quot;Mantrayana&quot; is sometimes portrayed as a method for those of inferior abilities, but the practitioner of mantra must still adhere to the Bodhisattva vow.

==Characteristics==
===Goal===
The goal of spiritual practice in the Mahayana and Vajrayāna traditions is to become a &quot;Sammāsambuddha&quot; (fully awakened Buddha); those on this path are termed Bodhisattvas. As with the Mahayana, motivation is a vital component of Vajrayāna practice. The Bodhisattva-path is an integral part of the Vajrayāna, which teaches that all practices are to be undertaken with the motivation to achieve Buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings.

In the vehicle of Sutra Mahayana, the &quot;path of the cause&quot; is taken whereby a practitioner starts with his or her potential Buddha-nature and nurtures it to produce the fruit of Buddhahood. In the Vajrayāna, the &quot;path of the fruit&quot; is taken whereby the practitioner takes his or her innate Buddha-nature as the means of practice. The premise is that since we innately have an enlightened mind, practicing seeing the world in terms of ultimate truth can help us attain our full Buddha-nature. Experiencing ultimate truth is said to be the purpose of all the various tantric techniques practiced in the Vajrayana.

=== Esoteric transmission ===

Vajrayāna Buddhism is esoteric in the sense that the transmission of certain teachings occurs only from teacher to student during an empowerment (&quot;abhiṣeka&quot;), and their practice requires initiation in a ritual space containing the mandala of the deity. Many techniques are also commonly said to be secret, but some Vajrayana teachers have responded that secrecy itself is not important and only a side effect of the reality that the techniques have no validity outside the teacher-student lineage.

The secrecy of teachings was often protected through the use of allusive, indirect, symbolic, and metaphorical language (twilight language) that required interpretation and guidance from a teacher. The teachings may also be considered &quot;self-secret&quot;, meaning that even if they were to be told directly to a person, that person would not necessarily understand the teachings without proper context. In this way, the teachings are &quot;secret&quot; to the minds of those who are not following the path with more than simple curiosity.

Esler points out that while secrecy is presented as necessary to prevent the teachings from falling into the hands of unworthy recipients, it also serves to demarcate a kind of religious in-group. He observes that from an anthropological perspective, allowing reference to the secret to &quot;remain close to the social surface&quot; through veiled allusions plays a more important role in some ways than the secret content itself, as it mobilizes the secret as a kind of symbolic capital.

Because of their role in giving access to the practices and guiding the student through them, the role of the Vajracharya Lama is indispensable in Vajrayāna.

=== Affirmation of the feminine, antinomian and taboo ===
Some Vajrayāna rituals traditionally included the use of certain taboo substances, such as blood, semen, alcohol, and urine, as ritual offerings and sacraments, though some of these are often replaced with less taboo substances such as yogurt. Tantric feasts and initiations sometimes employed substances like human flesh, as noted by Kahha&#x27;s &quot;Yogaratnamala&quot;.

The use of these substances is related to the non-dual (&quot;advaya&quot;) nature of a Buddha&#x27;s wisdom (&quot;buddhajñana&quot;). Since the ultimate state is in some sense non-dual, a practitioner can approach that state by &quot;transcending attachment to dual categories such as pure and impure, permitted and forbidden&quot;. As the &quot;Guhyasamaja Tantra&quot; states, &quot;the wise man who does not discriminate achieves Buddhahood&quot;.

Vajrayāna rituals also include sexual yoga, union with a physical consort as part of advanced practices. Some tantras go further: the &quot;Hevajra tantra&quot; states, &quot;You should kill living beings, speak lying words, take what is not given, consort with the women of others&quot;. While some of these statements were taken literally as part of ritual practice, others, such as killing, were interpreted metaphorically. In the Hevajra, &quot;killing&quot; is defined as developing concentration by killing the life-breath of discursive thoughts. Likewise, while actual sexual union with a physical consort is practiced, it is also common to use a visualized consort.

Wayman points out that the symbolic meaning of tantric sexuality is ultimately rooted in &quot;bodhicitta&quot; and the bodhisattva&#x27;s quest for enlightenment is likened to a lover seeking union with the mind of the Buddha. Judith Simmer-Brown notes the importance of the psycho-physical experiences arising in sexual yoga, termed &quot;great bliss&quot; (&quot;mahasukha&quot;): &quot;Bliss melts the conceptual mind, heightens sensory awareness, and opens the practitioner to the naked experience of the nature of mind.&quot; This tantric experience is not the same as ordinary self-gratifying sexual passion since it relies on tantric meditative methods using the illusory body and visualizations as well as the motivation for enlightenment. The &quot;Hevajra tantra&quot; says:

Feminine deities and forces are a major element of Vajrayāna. In the Yogini tantras in particular, women and female yoginis are given high status as the embodiment of female deities such as the wild and nude Vajrayogini. The &quot;Candamaharosana Tantra&quot; (&quot;viii:29–30&quot;) states:

In India, there is evidence that women participated in tantric practice alongside men and were also teachers, adepts, and authors of tantric texts.

=== Vows and behaviour ===

Practitioners of Vajrayāna must abide by various tantric vows or pledges called &quot;samaya&quot;. These are extensions of the rules of the Prātimokṣa and Bodhisattva vows for the lower levels of tantra, and are taken during initiations into the empowerment for a particular Unsurpassed Yoga Tantra. The special tantric vows vary depending on the specific mandala practice for which the initiation is received and on the level of initiation. Ngagpas of the Nyingma school keep a special non-celibate ordination.

A tantric guru, or teacher, is expected to keep his or her &quot;samaya&quot; vows in the same way as his students. Proper conduct is considered especially necessary for a qualified Vajrayana guru. For example, the &quot;Ornament for the Essence&quot; of Manjushrikirti states:

== Tantra techniques ==


While all Vajrayāna Buddhist traditions include all the traditional practices used in Mahayana Buddhism, such as developing bodhicitta, practicing the &quot;paramitas,&quot; and meditations, they also make use of unique tantric methods and Dzogchen meditation, which are seen as more advanced. These include mantras, mandalas, mudras, deity yoga, other visualization-based meditations, illusory body yogas like tummo, and rituals like the goma fire ritual. Vajrayana teaches that these techniques provide a faster path to Buddhahood.

A central feature of tantric practice is the use of mantras and seed syllables (&quot;bijas&quot;). Mantras are words, phrases, or a collection of syllables used for various meditative, magical, and ritual ends. Mantras are usually associated with specific deities or Buddhas, and are seen as their manifestations in sonic form. They are traditionally believed to have spiritual power, which can lead to enlightenment as well as supramundane abilities (&quot;siddhis&quot;).

According to Indologist Alex Wayman, Buddhist esotericism centers on what is known as &quot;the three mysteries&quot; or &quot;secrets&quot;: the tantric adept affiliates his body, speech, and mind with the body, speech, and mind of a Buddha through mudra, mantras, and samadhi, respectively. Padmavajra () explains in his &quot;Tantrarthavatara&quot; Commentary, the secret Body, Speech, and Mind of the Buddhas are:

These elements are brought together in the practice of tantric deity yoga, which involves visualizing the deity&#x27;s body and mandala, reciting the deity&#x27;s mantra, and gaining insight into the nature of things based on this contemplation. Advanced tantric practices such as deity yoga are taught in the context of an initiation ceremony by tantric gurus or vajracharyas (vajra-masters) to the tantric initiate, who also takes on formal commitments or vows (&quot;samaya&quot;). In Tibetan Buddhism, advanced practices like deity yoga are usually preceded by or coupled with &quot;preliminary practices&quot; called &quot;ngondro&quot;, consisting of five to seven accumulation practices and includes prostrations and recitations of the 100 syllable mantra.

Vajrayana is a system of tantric lineages, and thus only those who receive an empowerment or initiation (&quot;abhiseka&quot;) may practice the more advanced esoteric methods. In tantric deity yoga, mantras, or bijas are used during the ritual evocation of deities that are said to arise out of the uttered and visualized mantric syllables. After the deity&#x27;s image and mandala has been established, heart mantras are visualized as part of the contemplation in different points of the deity&#x27;s body.

Most Tantric Buddhists believe nirvana is achievable in a single lifetime with &quot;vigorous study and meditation&quot;.

===Deity yoga===


The fundamental practice of Buddhist Tantra is &quot;deity yoga&quot; (&quot;devatayoga&quot;), meditation on a chosen deity or &quot;cherished divinity&quot; (Skt. &quot;Iṣṭa-devatā,&quot; Tib. &quot;yidam&quot;), which involves the recitation of mantras and prayers and visualization of the deity, the associated mandala of the deity&#x27;s Buddha field, along with consorts and attendant Buddhas and bodhisattvas. According to the Tibetan scholar Tsongkhapa, deity yoga separates Tantra from Sutra practice.

In the Unsurpassed Yoga Tantras, the most widespread tantric form in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, this method is divided into two stages, generation (&quot;utpatti-krama&quot;) and completion (&quot;nispanna-krama&quot;). In the generation stage, one dissolves one&#x27;s reality into emptiness and meditates on the deity-mandala, resulting in identification with this divine reality. In the completion stage, the divine image along with the illusory body is applied to the realization of luminous emptiness.

This dissolution into emptiness is then followed by the visualization of the deity and the yogi&#x27;s re-emergence as the deity. During deity visualization, the deity is to be imagined as not solid or tangible, as &quot;empty yet apparent&quot;, with the character of a mirage or a rainbow. This visualization is to be combined with &quot;divine pride&quot;, which is &quot;the thought that one is oneself the deity being visualized.&quot; Divine pride is different from common pride because it is based on compassion for others and an understanding of emptiness.

The Tibetologist David Germano outlines two main types of completion practice: a formless and image-less contemplation on the ultimate empty nature of the mind and various yogas that make use of the illusory body to produce energetic sensations of bliss and warmth.

The illusory body yogas systems like the Six Dharmas of Naropa and the Six Yogas of Kalachakra make use of energetic schemas of human psycho-physiology composed of &quot;energy channels&quot; (Skt. nadi, Tib. &quot;rtsa&quot;), &quot;winds&quot; or currents (Skt. &quot;vayu&quot;, Tib. &quot;rlung&quot;), &quot;drops&quot; or charged particles (Skt. &quot;bindu&quot;, Tib. &quot;thig le&quot;), and chakras (&quot;wheels&quot;). These subtle energies are seen as &quot;mounts&quot; for consciousness, the physical component of awareness. They are engaged by various means such as pranayama (breath control) to produce blissful experiences that are then applied to the realization of ultimate reality.

Other methods associated with the completion stage in Tibetan Buddhism include dream yoga (which relies on lucid dreaming), practices associated with the bardo (the interim state between death and rebirth), transference of consciousness (&quot;phowa&quot;), and Chöd, in which the yogi ceremonially offers their body to be eaten by tantric deities in a ritual feast.

===Other practices===
Another form of Vajrayana practice are certain meditative techniques associated with Mahāmudrā and Dzogchen, often termed &quot;formless practices&quot; or the path of self-liberation. These techniques do not rely on deity visualization per se but on direct pointing-out instruction from a master, and are often seen as the most advanced and direct methods.

Another distinctive feature of Tantric Buddhism is its unique and often elaborate rituals. They include pujas (worship rituals), prayer festivals, protection rituals, death rituals, tantric feasts (&quot;ganachakra&quot;), tantric initiations (&quot;abhiseka&quot;) and the goma fire ritual (common in East Asian Esotericism).

An important element in some of these rituals (particularly initiations and tantric feasts) seems to have been the practice of ritual sex or sexual yoga (&quot;karmamudra,&quot; &quot;desire seal&quot;, also called &quot;consort observance&quot;, &quot;vidyavrata,&quot; and euphemistically as &quot;puja&quot;), as well as the sacramental ingestion of &quot;power substances&quot; such as the mingled sexual fluids and uterine blood (often performed by licking these substances off the vulva, a practice termed &quot;yonipuja&quot;).

The practice of ingestion of sexual fluids is mentioned by numerous tantric commentators, sometimes euphemistically referring to the penis as the &quot;vajra&quot; and the vagina as the &quot;lotus&quot;. The &quot;Cakrasamvara Tantra&quot; commentator Kambala, writing about this practice, states:

The seats are well-known on earth to be spots within the lotus mandala; by abiding within it there is great bliss, the royal nature of nondual joy. Therefore the lotus seat is supreme: filled with a mixture of semen and uterine blood, one should especially kiss it, and lolling with the tongue take it up. Unite the vajra and lotus, with the rapture of drinking [this] liquor.

According to David Gray, these sexual practices probably originated in a non-monastic context and were later adopted by monastic establishments (such as Nalanda and Vikramashila). He notes that the anxiety of figures like Atisa about these practices, and the stories of Virūpa and Maitripa being expelled from their monasteries for performing them, shows that supposedly celibate monastics were undertaking these sexual rites.

Because of its adoption by the monastic tradition, sexual yoga slowly became either done with an imaginary consort visualized by the yogi instead of an actual person, or reserved to a small group of the &quot;highest&quot; or elite practitioners. Likewise, the drinking of sexual fluids was also reinterpreted by later commentators to refer to illusory body anatomy of the perfection stage practices.

==Symbols and imagery==
Vajrayāna uses a rich variety of symbols, terms, and images that have multiple meanings according to a complex system of analogical thinking. In Vajrayāna, symbols, and terms are multi-valent, reflecting the microcosm and the macrocosm as in the phrase &quot;As without, so within&quot; (&quot;yatha bahyam tatha ’dhyatmam iti&quot;) from Abhayakaragupta&#x27;s &quot;Nispannayogavali&quot;.

===The vajra===
The Sanskrit term &quot;vajra&quot; denoted a thunderbolt like a legendary weapon and divine attribute that was made from an adamantine, or an indestructible substance which could, therefore, pierce and penetrate any obstacle or obfuscation. It is the weapon of choice of Indra, the King of the Devas. As a secondary meaning, &quot;vajra&quot; symbolizes the ultimate nature of things which is described in the tantras as translucent, pure and radiant, but also indestructible and indivisible. It is also symbolic of the power of tantric methods to achieve its goals.

A vajra is also a scepter-like ritual object ( &quot;dorje&quot;), which has a sphere (and sometimes a gankyil) at its centre, and a variable number of spokes, 3, 5 or 9 at each end (depending on the sadhana), enfolding either end of the rod. The vajra is often traditionally employed in tantric rituals in combination with the bell or ghanta; symbolically, the vajra may represent method as well as great bliss and the bell stands for wisdom, specifically the wisdom realizing emptiness. The union of the two sets of spokes at the center of the wheel is said to symbolize the unity of wisdom (prajña) and compassion (karuna) as well as the sexual union of male and female deities.

===Imagery and ritual in deity yoga===
Representations of the deity, such as statues (&quot;murti&quot;), paintings (&quot;thangka&quot;), or mandala, are often employed as an aid to visualization, in deity yoga. The use of visual aids, particularly microcosmic/macrocosmic diagrams, known as &quot;mandalas&quot;, is another unique feature of Buddhist Tantra. Mandalas are symbolic depictions of the sacred space of the awakened Buddhas and Bodhisattvas as well as of the inner workings of the human person. The macrocosmic symbolism of the mandala then, also represents the forces of the human body. The explanatory tantra of the &quot;Guhyasamaja tantra&quot;, the &quot;Vajramala&quot;, states: &quot;The body becomes a palace, the hallowed basis of all the Buddhas.&quot;

Mandalas are also sacred enclosures, sacred architecture that house and contain the uncontainable essence of a central deity or &quot;yidam&quot; and their retinue. In the book &quot;The World of Tibetan Buddhism&quot;, the Dalai Lama describes mandalas thus: &quot;This is the celestial mansion, the pure residence of the deity.&quot; The Five Tathagatas or &#x27;Five Buddhas&#x27;, along with the figure of the Adi-Buddha, are central to many Vajrayana mandalas as they represent the &quot;five wisdoms&quot;, which are the five primary aspects of primordial wisdom or Buddha-nature.

All ritual in Vajrayana practice can be seen as aiding in this process of visualization and identification. The practitioner can use various hand implements such as a &quot;vajra&quot;, bell, hand-drum (&quot;damaru&quot;) or a ritual dagger (&quot;phurba&quot;), but also ritual hand gestures (&quot;mudras&quot;) can be made, special chanting techniques can be used, and in elaborate offering rituals or initiations, many more ritual implements and tools are used, each with an elaborate symbolic meaning to create a special environment for practice. Vajrayana has thus become a major inspiration in traditional Tibetan art.

There is an extended body of texts associated with Buddhist Tantra, including the &quot;tantras&quot; themselves, tantric commentaries and &quot;shastras&quot;, &quot;sadhanas&quot; (liturgical texts), ritual manuals (Chinese: 儀軌; Pinyin: &quot;Yíguǐ&quot;; Rōmaji: &quot;Giki&quot;), dharanis, poems or songs (&quot;dohas&quot;), termas and so on. According to Harunaga Isaacson,

Though we do not know precisely at present just how many Indian tantric Buddhist texts survive today in the language in which they were written, their number is certainly over one thousand five hundred; I suspect indeed over two thousand. A large part of this body of texts has also been translated into Tibetan, and a smaller part into Chinese. Aside from these, there are perhaps another two thousand or more works that are known today only from such translations. We can be certain as well that many others are lost to us forever, in whatever form. Of the texts that survive a very small proportion has been published; an almost insignificant percentage has been edited or translated reliably.

Vajrayāna texts exhibit a wide range of literary characteristics—usually a mix of verse and prose, almost always in a Sanskrit that &quot;transgresses frequently against classical norms of grammar and usage,&quot; although also occasionally in various Middle Indic dialects or elegant classical Sanskrit.

In Chinese Mantrayana (&quot;Zhenyan&quot;), and Japanese Shingon, the most influential esoteric texts are the &quot;Mahavairocana Tantra&quot; and the &quot;Vajraśekhara Sūtra&quot;.

In Tibetan Buddhism, a large number of tantric works are widely studied and different schools focus on the study and practice of different cycles of texts. According to Geoffrey Samuel,

=== Dunhuang manuscripts ===
The Dunhuang manuscripts also contain Tibetan Tantric manuscripts. Dalton and Schaik (2007, revised) provide an excellent online catalogue listing 350 Tibetan Tantric Manuscripts] from Dunhuang in the Stein Collection of the British Library which is currently fully accessible online in discrete digitized manuscripts. With the Wylie transcription of the manuscripts they are to be made discoverable online in the future. These 350 texts are just a small portion of the vast cache of the Dunhuang manuscripts.

==Traditions==

Although there is historical evidence for Vajrayāna Buddhism in Southeast Asia and elsewhere (see History of Vajrayāna above), today the Vajrayāna exists primarily in the form of the two major traditions of Indo-Tibetan Buddhism (in Tibet and other parts of the PRC, Bhutan, India and also internationally) and Japanese Esoteric Buddhism (mostly in Japan), which is found in the Shingon (literally &quot;True Speech&quot;, i.e. &quot;mantra&quot;) and Tendai schools.

Other traditions like contemporary Chinese Buddhism, Japanese Zen, Korean Buddhism, and Vietnamese Buddhism also make use of esoteric (Chinese: mijiao, Japanese: mikkyo) or mantrayana methods to a lesser extent. In many Asian Mahayana Buddhist traditions, esoteric methods are used as a complement, not as the central practice. This mainly involves the recitation of mantras (like the ten small mantras) and various popular dharanis. However, certain revival movements have attempted to establish new esoteric schools in mainland East Asia such as Mantra School Bright Lineage (in China) and the South Korean Jingak Order.

There was strong connection between the Palas in Bengal, Srivijaya in Nusantara, and the kingdoms in East Asia through the sea route. Medieval monks were a prime factor in the spread of esoteric Buddhism.

The distinction between mantrayana traditions is not always rigid. For example, the tantra sections of the Tibetan Buddhist canon of texts sometimes include material not usually thought of as tantric outside the Tibetan Buddhist tradition, such as the widely recited &quot;Heart Sutra&quot; and even versions of some material found in the &quot;Pali Canon&quot;.

=== Chinese Esoteric Buddhism ===
Esoteric and Tantric teachings followed the same route into northern China as Buddhism itself, arriving via the Silk Road and Southeast Asian Maritime trade routes sometime during the first half of the 7th century, during the Tang dynasty and received sanction from the emperors of the Tang dynasty. During this time, three great masters came from India to China: Śubhakarasiṃha, Vajrabodhi, and Amoghavajra who translated key texts and founded the &quot;Zhenyan&quot; (真言, &quot;true word&quot;, &quot;mantra&quot;) tradition.

&quot;Zhenyan&quot; was also brought to Japan as Shingon during this period. This tradition focused on tantras like the Mahavairocana tantra, and unlike Tibetan Buddhism, it does not employ the antinomian and radical tantrism of the &quot;Anuttarayoga Tantras.&quot; The prestige of this tradition eventually influenced other schools of Chinese Buddhism such as Chan and Tiantai to adopt various esoteric practices over time, leading to a merging of teachings between the various schools. During the Yuan dynasty, the Mongol emperors made Tibetan Buddhism the official religion of China, and Tibetan lamas were given patronage at the court. Imperial support of Tibetan Vajrayana continued into the Ming and Qing dynasties.

Today, esoteric traditions are deeply embedded in mainstream Chinese Buddhism and expressed through various rituals which make use of tantric mantra and dhāraṇī and the veneration of certain tantric deities like Cundi and Acala. One example of esoteric teachings still practiced in many Chinese Buddhist monasteries is the Śūraṅgama Sūtra and the dhāraṇī revealed within it, the Śūraṅgama Mantra, which are especially influential in the Chinese Chan tradition.

A recent development is known as the &quot;tantric revival movement&quot; (mijiao fuxing yundong 密教復興運動) which involved the revival of Chinese Esoteric schools by Chinese students of Japanese Shingon. Some important figures of this revival include Wang Hongyuan 王弘願 (1876–1937), and Guru Wuguang (悟光上師 (1918–2000), both trained in Shingon and went on to spread Shingon teachings in the Chinese speaking world. These revivalist lineages exist in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Malaysia. Though they draw mainly from Shingon teachings, they have also adopted some Tibetan Buddhist elements.

Another form of esoteric Buddhism in China is the related but unique tradition of Azhaliism, which is practiced among the Bai people of China and venerates Mahakala as a major deity.

=== Japanese esotericism ===
====Shingon Buddhism====

The Shingon school is found in Japan and includes practices, known in Japan as &quot;Mikkyō&quot; (&quot;Esoteric (or Mystery) Teaching&quot;), which are similar in concept to those in Vajrayana Buddhism. The lineage for Shingon Buddhism differs from that of Tibetan Vajrayana, having emerged from India during the 9th–11th centuries in the Pala Dynasty and Central Asia (via China) and is based on earlier versions of the Indian texts than the Tibetan lineage. Shingon shares material with Tibetan Buddhism – such as the esoteric sutras (called Tantras in Tibetan Buddhism) and mandalas – but the actual practices are not related.

The primary texts of Shingon Buddhism are the &quot;Mahavairocana Sutra&quot; and &quot;Vajrasekhara Sutra&quot;. The founder of Shingon Buddhism was Kukai, a Japanese monk who studied in China in the 9th century during the Tang dynasty and brought back Vajrayana scriptures, techniques and mandalas then popular in China. The school was merged into other schools in China towards the end of the Tang dynasty but was sectarian in Japan. Shingon is one of the few remaining branches of Buddhism in the world that continues to use the &quot;siddham&quot; script of the Sanskrit language.

====Tendai Buddhism====

Although the Tendai school in China and Japan does employ some esoteric practices, these rituals came to be considered of equal importance with the exoteric teachings of the &quot;Lotus Sutra&quot;. By chanting mantras, maintaining mudras, or practicing certain forms of meditation, Tendai maintains that one is able to understand sense experiences as taught by the Buddha, have faith that one is innately an enlightened being, and that one can attain enlightenment within the current lifetime.

===Korean &quot;milgyo&quot;===
Esoteric Buddhist practices (known as &quot;milgyo&quot;, 密教) and texts arrived in Korea during the initial introduction of Buddhism to the region in 372 CE. Esoteric Buddhism was supported by the royalty of both Unified Silla (668–935) and Goryeo Dynasty (918–1392). During the Goryeo Dynasty esoteric practices were common within large sects like the Seon school, and the Hwaeom school as well as smaller esoteric sects like the Sinin (&quot;mudra&quot;) and Ch&#x27;ongji (&quot;Dharani&quot;) schools. During the era of the Mongol occupation (1251–1350s), Tibetan Buddhism also existed in Korea though it never gained a foothold there.

During the Joseon dynasty, Esoteric Buddhist schools were forced to merge with the Seon and Kyo schools, becoming the ritual specialists. With the decline of Buddhism in Korea, Esoteric Buddhism mostly died out, save for a few traces in the rituals of the Jogye Order and Taego Order.

There are five esoteric Buddhist schools in modern day South Korea: Jingak Order, Jineon Order, Chongji Order, Jisong Order, and Cheonhwa Buddhism. According to Henrik H. Sørensen, the Jineon and Jingak Orders, &quot;have absolutely no historical link with the Korean Buddhist tradition per se but are late constructs based in large measures on Japanese Shingon Buddhism.&quot;

=== Vietnamese Buddhist esotericism ===

Vietnamese Buddhist esotericism is known as &quot;Mật giáo&quot; or &quot;Mật Tông&quot; and is a common part of Vietnamese Mahayana Buddhism (along with Pure Land practice and Thien). Commonly recited esoteric texts include &quot;Uṣṇīṣavijayadhāraṇī&quot;, the &quot;Nīlakaṇṭha Dhāraṇī&quot; and the &quot;Śūraṅgama mantra&quot;. According to Quang Minh Thich &quot;at present, it is still the norm in Vietnamese Buddhist temples, both in Vietnam and abroad, that these mantras, as elements of the Mantrayana, are recited either in their distinctive chanted sessions or in conjunction with other popular Buddhist scriptures. In function, the Vietnamese Tantric practices serve as a complement to the practices of Zen and Pure Land, not as an independent tradition.&quot;

The first Vietnamese monk we know of who studied Vajrayana was Master Van Ky () who received initiation in the kingdom of Srivijaya from a certain Jñanabhadra (Tri Hien) as reported by Yijing. By the 12th century (under the Lý dynasty), esoteric Buddhism was widespread in Vietnam, and was especially favored by the Vô Ngôn Thông school as well as by the Vinitaruci school. One famous esoteric master of this period was Từ Đạo Hạnh. He brought back various texts and practices from Burma. He became famous as a powerful magician. He was fond of the &quot;Mahākaruṇika Dhāraṇī&quot;. He also spread esoteric teachings throughout Vietnam and liberalized their practice, making them less dependent on reincarnation lineages (similar to Tibetan tulkus). Another promoter of esoteric Buddhism during this period was Sùng Phạm (1004-1078) of Phap Van pagoda who studied in India for nine years before returning to Vietnam and was the teacher of the influential esoteric master Tri Bat. Phap Loa (1284-1330), a leader of the Truc Lam school, was another very influential Vietnamese esoteric master. He is known for establishing esoteric abhiseka (initiation) ceremonies as well as Huayan (&quot;Hoa Nghiêm&quot;) assemblies. He also wrote various texts on esoteric topics.

Chinese Buddhist esotericism also influenced Vietnamese esotericism during the medieval period, especially the Huayan Esotericism of Daoshen&#x27;s &quot;Xianmi yuantong chengfo xinyao ji&quot; (顯密圓通成佛心要集 &quot;Collection of Essentials for the Attainment of Buddhahood by Total [Inter-]Penetration of the Esoteric and the Exoteric,&quot; T1955).

Some modern teachers and organizations focus specifically on Vietnamese esoteric Buddhism. Thích Viên Đức (1932-1980) was one important modern promoter of Esoteric Buddhism. He is known for translating a collection of Esoteric Buddhist texts, contributing to the dissemination of Esoteric Buddhism in Vietnam. Thích Viên Đức promoted esoteric Buddhist teachings as the fastest path to enlightenment. He established numerous communities in southern Vietnam and was also known as a healer. He also met with Tibetan lamas and Japanese Buddhists. Another modern Vietnamese esoteric organization is Mat Giao Friendship Association who publishes Phước Triệu&#x27;s &quot;Quintessence of Esoteric Buddhism&quot; (2004). Esoteric practices are also currently associated with the Thầy Temple in Greater Hanoi. Vietnamese esotericism can also be quite sycretic, borrowing from Chinese, Japanese and Tibetan Buddhism.

=== Indo-Tibetan Buddhism ===

Vajrayāna Buddhism was initially established in Tibet in the 8th century when various figures like Padmasambhāva (8th century CE) and Śāntarakṣita (725–788) were invited by King Trisong Detsen, some time before 767. Tibetan Buddhism reflects the later stages tantric Indian Buddhism of the post-Gupta Early Medieval period (500 to 1200 CE).

This tradition practices and studies a set of tantric texts and commentaries associated with the more &quot;left hand&quot; (&quot;vamachara&quot;) tantras, which are not part of East Asian Esoteric Buddhism. These tantras (sometimes termed &#x27;Anuttarayoga tantras&#x27; include many transgressive elements, such as sexual and mortuary symbolism that is not shared by the earlier tantras that are studied in East Asian Buddhism. These texts were translated into Classical Tibetan during the &quot;New translation period&quot; (10th–12th centuries). Tibetan Buddhism also includes numerous native Tibetan developments, such as the tulku system, new sadhana texts, Tibetan scholastic works, Dzogchen literature and Terma literature. There are four major traditions or schools: Nyingma, Sakya, Kagyu, and Gelug.

In the pre-modern era, Tibetan Buddhism spread outside of Tibet primarily due to the influence of the Mongol Yuan dynasty (1271–1368), founded by Kublai Khan, which ruled China, Mongolia and eastern Siberia. In the modern era it has spread outside of Asia due to the efforts of the Tibetan diaspora (1959 onwards).

The Tibetan Buddhist tradition is today found in Tibet, Bhutan, northern India, Nepal, southwestern and northern China, Mongolia and various constituent republics of Russia that are adjacent to the area, such as Amur Oblast, Buryatia, Zabaykalsky Krai, the Tuva Republic and Khabarovsk Krai. Tibetan Buddhism is also the main religion in Kalmykia. It has also spread to Western countries and there are now international networks of Tibetan Buddhist temples and meditation centers in the Western world from all four schools.

===Bengali Buddhism===


Bengal was a thriving centre of Vajrayana under the patronage of the Pala dynasty. Many mahasiddhas hailed from the Eastern zone of the Indian subcontinent, with the &quot;Charyapada&quot;, a collection of songs composed by these mahasiddhas, containing early references to Vajrayana as well as being an early written record of Eastern Indic languages. Bengali Vajrayana scholar Atiśa played a vital role in revitalizing Buddhism in Tibet following its persecution by the Bon emperor Langdarma and onset of the Era of Fragmentation. Another Bengali Vajrayana scholar Abhayakaragupta also had a profound impact on Tibetan Buddhism. However Vajrayana declined by the time the Sena dynasty came to power. Vajrayana was further affected by the Islamic conquest of India &amp; consolidation of Muslim rule in Bengal, with many of its adherents converting to Islam &amp; later Gaudiya Vaishnavism, which lead to creation of new groups like Sahajiyas. Today Buddhism in Bengal is followed only by a small minority of Jumma people who are followers of Theravāda Buddhism.

===Nepalese Newar Buddhism===
Newar Buddhism is practiced by Newars in Nepal. It is the only form of Vajrayana Buddhism in which the scriptures are written in Sanskrit and this tradition has preserved many Vajrayana texts in this language. Its priests do not follow celibacy and are called &quot;vajracharya&quot; (literally &quot;diamond-thunderbolt carriers&quot;).

=== Indonesian Esoteric Buddhism ===
Indonesian Esoteric Buddhism refers to the traditions of Esoteric Buddhism found in the Indonesian islands of Java and Sumatra before the rise and dominance of Islam in the region (13–16th centuries). The Buddhist empire of Srivijaya (650 CE–1377 CE) was a major center of Esoteric Buddhist learning which drew Chinese monks such as Yijing and Indian scholars like Atiśa. The temple complex at Borobudur in central Java, built by the Shailendra dynasty also reflects strong Tantric or at least proto-tantric influences, particularly of the cult of Vairocana.

Indonesian Esoteric Buddhism may have also reached the Philippines, possibly establishing the first form of Buddhism in the Philippines. The few Buddhist artifacts that have been found in the islands reflect the iconography of Srivijaya&#x27;s Vajrayana.

== Related traditions ==
Some traditions are related to Vajrayana, but are not to be seen as &quot;Vajrayana&quot; or &quot;Mantrayana&quot; proper. Vajrayana here referring to the Buddhist tradition based on the tantric literature of North Indian Mahayana, the Buddhist tantras and the works of the Nalanda - Vikramashila masters and the Buddhist mahasiddhas. However, these related traditions may have been influenced by Vajrayana proper and have borrowed practices from Vajrayana schools.

=== Shugendō ===

Shugendō was founded in 7th-century Japan by the ascetic En no Gyōja, based on the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Peacocks Sutra&quot;. With its origins in the solitary &quot;hijiri&quot; back in the 7th century, Shugendō evolved as a sort of amalgamation between Esoteric Buddhism, Shinto and several other religious influences including Taoism. Buddhism and Shinto were amalgamated in the &quot;shinbutsu shūgō&quot;, and Kūkai&#x27;s syncretic religion held wide sway up until the end of the Edo period, coexisting with Shinto elements within Shugendō

In 1613 during the Edo period, the Tokugawa Shogunate issued a regulation obliging Shugendō temples to belong to either Shingon or Tendai temples. During the Meiji Restoration, when Shinto was declared an independent state religion separate from Buddhism, Shugendō was banned as a superstition not fit for a new, enlightened Japan. Some Shugendō temples converted themselves into various officially approved Shintō denominations. In modern times, Shugendō is practiced mainly by Tendai and Shingon sects, retaining an influence on modern Japanese religion and culture.

===Southern Esoteric Buddhism===
&quot;Southern Esoteric Buddhism&quot; or Borān kammaṭṭhāna (&#x27;ancient practices&#x27;) is a term for esoteric forms of Buddhism from Southeast Asia, where Theravada Buddhism is dominant. The monks of the Sri Lankan, Abhayagiri vihara once practiced forms of tantra which were popular in the island. Another tradition of this type was Ari Buddhism, which was common in Burma. The Tantric Buddhist &#x27;Yogāvacara&#x27; tradition was a major Buddhist tradition in Cambodia, Laos and Thailand well into the modern era.

Southern Esoteric Buddhism is a unique Southeast Asian development based on Theravada Abhidhamma and Pali language sources. As such, it has no direct connection to the Indian &quot;Vajrayana&quot; of the Buddhist tantras, the Indian mahasiddhas and the Nalanda-Vikramashila traditions.

Southern Esoteric Buddhism declined after the rise of Southeast Asian Buddhist modernism. However, esoteric Buddhist practices remain in some contemporary South East Asian traditions, including the Thai Dhammakaya tradition, the Burmese Weizza tradition and in rural Cambodian Buddhism.

==Academic study difficulties==
Serious Vajrayana academic study in the Western world is in early stages due to the following obstacles:
# Although a large number of Tantric scriptures are extant, they have not been formally ordered or systematized.
# Due to the esoteric initiatory nature of the tradition, many practitioners will not divulge information or sources of their information.
# As with many different subjects, it must be studied in context and with a long history spanning many different cultures.
# Ritual, as well as doctrine, need to be investigated.

Buddhist tantric practice is categorized as secret practice; this is to avoid misinformed people from harmfully misusing the practices. A method to keep this secrecy is that tantric initiation is required from a master before any instructions can be received about the actual practice. During the initiation procedure in the highest class of tantra (such as the Kalachakra), students must take the tantric vows which commit them to such secrecy. &quot;Explaining general tantra theory in a scholarly manner, not sufficient for practice, is likewise not a root downfall. Nevertheless, it weakens the effectiveness of our tantric practice.&quot;

=== Terminology ===
The terminology associated with Vajrayana Buddhism can be confusing. Most of the terms originated in the Sanskrit language of tantric Indian Buddhism and may have passed through other cultures, notably those of Japan and Tibet, before translation for the modern reader. Further complications arise as seemingly equivalent terms can have subtle variations in use and meaning according to context, the time and place of use. A third problem is that the Vajrayana texts employ the tantric tradition of twilight language, a means of instruction that is deliberately coded. These obscure teaching methods relying on symbolism as well as synonym, metaphor and word association add to the difficulties faced by those attempting to understand Vajrayana Buddhism:
The term Tantric Buddhism was not one originally used by those who practiced it. As scholar Isabelle Onians explains:

<text>The Basílica i Temple Expiatori de la Sagrada Família, otherwise known as Sagrada Família, is a church under construction in the Eixample district of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. It is the largest unfinished Catholic church in the world. Designed by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí (1852–1926), in 2005 his work on Sagrada Família was added to an existing (1984) UNESCO World Heritage Site, &quot;Works of Antoni Gaudí&quot;. On 7 November 2010, Pope Benedict XVI consecrated the church and proclaimed it a minor basilica.

On 19 March 1882, construction of Sagrada Família began under architect Francisco de Paula del Villar. In 1883, when Villar resigned, Gaudí took over as chief architect, transforming the project with his architectural and engineering style, combining Gothic and curvilinear Art Nouveau forms. Gaudí devoted the remainder of his life to the project, and he is buried in the church&#x27;s crypt. At the time of his death in 1926, less than a quarter of the project was complete.

Relying solely on private donations, Sagrada Família&#x27;s construction progressed slowly and was interrupted by the Spanish Civil War. In July 1936, anarchists from the FAI set fire to the crypt and broke their way into the workshop, partially destroying Gaudí&#x27;s original plans. In 1939, Francesc de Paula Quintana took over site management, which was able to go on with the material that was saved from Gaudí&#x27;s workshop and that was reconstructed from published plans and photographs. Construction resumed to intermittent progress in the 1950s. Advancements in technologies such as computer-aided design and computerised numerical control (CNC) have since enabled faster progress and construction passed the midpoint in 2010. In 2014, it was anticipated that the building would be completed by 2026, the centenary of Gaudí&#x27;s death, but this schedule was threatened by work slowdowns caused by the 2020–2021 depths of the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2024, an updated forecast reconfirmed a likely completion of the building in 2026, though the announcement stated that work on sculptures, decorative details and a controversial proposed stairway leading to what will eventually be the main entrance is expected to continue until 2034.

Describing Sagrada Família, art critic Rainer Zerbst said &quot;it is probably impossible to find a church building anything like it in the entire history of art&quot;, and Paul Goldberger describes it as &quot;the most extraordinary personal interpretation of Gothic architecture since the Middle Ages&quot;. 

Though sometimes described as a cathedral, the basilica is not the cathedral church of the Archdiocese of Barcelona; that title belongs to the Cathedral of the Holy Cross and Saint Eulalia (Barcelona Cathedral).

==History==
===Origins===
Sagrada Família was inspired by a bookseller, {{Interlanguage link|José María Bocabella|es|José María Bocabella}}, founder of Asociación Espiritual de Devotos de San José (Spiritual Association of Devotees of St. Joseph). After a visit to the Vatican in 1872, Bocabella returned from Italy with the intention of building a church inspired by the basilica at Loreto. The apse crypt of the church, funded by donations, was begun 19 March 1882, on the festival of St. Joseph, to the design of the architect Francisco de Paula del Villar, whose plan was for a Gothic revival church of a standard form. The apse crypt was completed before Villar&#x27;s resignation on 18 March 1883, when Antoni Gaudí assumed responsibility for its design, which he changed radically. Gaudi began work on the church in 1883 but was not appointed Architect Director until 1884.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}
===20th century===
On the subject of the extremely long construction period, Gaudí is said to have remarked: &quot;My client is not in a hurry.&quot; When Gaudí died in 1926, the basilica was between 15 and 25 percent complete. After Gaudí&#x27;s death, work continued under the direction of his main disciple Domènec Sugrañes i Gras until interrupted by the Spanish Civil War in 1936. Parts of the unfinished basilica and Gaudí&#x27;s models and workshop were destroyed during the war. The present design is based on reconstructed versions of the plans that were burned in a fire as well as on modern adaptations. Since 1940, the architects Francesc Quintana, Isidre Puig Boada, Lluís Bonet i Garí and Francesc Cardoner have carried on the work. The illumination was designed by Carles Buïgas. The director until 2012 was the son of Lluís Bonet, Jordi Bonet i Armengol. Armengol began introducing computers into the design and construction process in the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

=== 21st century ===
The central nave vaulting was completed in 2000 and the main tasks since then have been the construction of the transept vaults and apse. In 2002, the Sagrada Família Schools building was relocated from the eastern corner of the site to the southern corner, and began housing an exhibition. The school was originally designed by Gaudí in 1909 for the children of the construction workers.

{{As of|2006}}, work concentrated on the crossing and supporting structure for the main steeple of Jesus Christ as well as the southern enclosure of the central nave, which will become the Glory façade. Computer-aided design technology has allowed stone to be shaped off-site by a CNC milling machine, whereas in the 20th century the stone was carved by hand. In 2008, some renowned Catalan architects advocated halting construction to respect Gaudí&#x27;s original designs, which, although they were not exhaustive and were partially destroyed, have been partially reconstructed in recent years.

Since 2013, AVE high-speed trains have passed near Sagrada Família through a tunnel that runs beneath the centre of Barcelona. The tunnel&#x27;s construction, which began on 26 March 2010, was controversial. The Ministry of Public Works of Spain ({{lang|es|Ministerio de Fomento}}) claimed the project posed no risk to the church. Sagrada Família engineers and architects disagreed, saying there was no guarantee that the tunnel would not affect the stability of the building. The Board of the Sagrada Família ({{lang|es|Patronat de la Sagrada Família}}) and the neighborhood association {{lang|es|AVE pel Litoral}} (AVE by the Coast) led a campaign against this route for the AVE, without success.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} In October 2010, the tunnel boring machine reached the church underground under the location of the building&#x27;s principal façade. Service through the tunnel was inaugurated on 8 January 2013. Track in the tunnel makes use of a system by Edilon Sedra in which the rails are embedded in an elastic material to dampen vibrations.

The main nave was covered and an organ installed in mid-2010, allowing the still-unfinished building to be used for liturgies. The church was consecrated by Pope Benedict XVI on 7 November 2010 in front of a congregation of 6,500{{nbsp}}people. A further 50,000 people followed the consecration Mass from outside the basilica, where more than 100{{nbsp}}bishops and 300{{nbsp}}priests were on hand to distribute Holy Communion.
In 2012, Barcelona-born Jordi Faulí i Oller took over as architect of the project. Mark Burry of New Zealand serves as Executive Architect and Researcher. Sculptures by J. Busquets, Etsuro Sotoo and Josep Maria Subirachs decorate the fantastical façades.

Chief architect Jordi Faulí announced in October 2015 that construction was 70 percent complete and had entered its final phase of raising six immense steeples. The steeples and most of the church&#x27;s structure were planned to be completed by 2026, the centennial of Gaudí&#x27;s death; as of a 2017 estimate, decorative elements should be complete by 2030 or 2032.{{Failed verification|date=October 2023}} Visitor entrance fees of €15 to €20 finance the annual construction budget of €25{{nbsp}}million. Completion of the structure will use post-tensioned stone.

Starting on 9 July 2017, an international mass is celebrated at the basilica every Sunday and holy day of obligation, at 9{{nbsp}}a.m., and is open to the public (until the church is full). Occasionally, Mass is celebrated at other times, where attendance requires an invitation. When masses are scheduled, instructions to obtain an invitation are posted on the basilica&#x27;s website. In addition, visitors may pray in the chapel of the Blessed Sacrament and Penitence.

The stone initially used in its construction came from the Montserrat mountain, but it became clear that as quarrying there went deeper, the stone was increasingly fragile and an alternative source had to be found. Since 2018 stone of the type needed to complete the construction has been sourced from the Withnell Quarry in Brinscall, near Chorley, England.

===Historical photographs of Sagrada Família===
== Incidents ==
On 19 April 2011, an arsonist started a small fire in the sacristy which forced the evacuation of tourists and construction workers. The sacristy was damaged, and the fire took 45 minutes to contain.

On 11 March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic in Spain, construction temporarily stopped and the basilica was closed. This was the first time the construction had been halted since the Spanish Civil War. The Gaudí House Museum in Park Güell was also closed. The basilica reopened, initially to key workers, on 4 July 2020.

Local residents have concerns about plans to build a large stairway leading up to the basilica&#x27;s main entrance, unfinished at the time, which could require the demolition of three city blocks: the homes to 1,000 people as well as some businesses.

==Design==
The style of Sagrada Família is variously likened to Spanish Late Gothic, Catalan Modernism or Art Nouveau. While the style falls within the Art Nouveau period, Nikolaus Pevsner points out that, along with Charles Rennie Mackintosh in Glasgow, Scotland, Gaudí carried the Art Nouveau style far beyond its usual application as a surface decoration.

===Plan===
While never a cathedral, Sagrada Família was planned from the outset to be a large building, comparable in size to a cathedral. Its ground-plan has obvious links to earlier Spanish cathedrals such as Burgos Cathedral, León Cathedral and Seville Cathedral. In common with Catalan and many other European Gothic cathedrals, Sagrada Família is short in comparison to its width, and has a great complexity of parts, which include double aisles, an ambulatory with a chevet of seven apsidal chapels, a multitude of steeples and three portals, each widely different in structure as well as ornament.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Where it is common for cathedrals in Spain to be surrounded by numerous chapels and ecclesiastical buildings, the layout of Sagrada Família has an unusual feature: a covered passage or cloister which forms a rectangle enclosing the church and passing through the narthex of each of its three portals. With this peculiarity aside, the plan, influenced by Villar&#x27;s crypt, barely hints at the complexity of Gaudí&#x27;s design or its deviations from traditional church architecture.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} There are no exact right angles to be seen inside or outside the church, and few straight lines in the design.

===Spires===

Gaudí&#x27;s original design calls for a total of eighteen spires, representing in ascending order of height the Twelve Apostles,{{efn|Note: the two Apostles who are also Evangelists are left out and replaced by St. Paul and also St. Barnabas.}} the four Evangelists, the Virgin Mary, and, tallest of all, Jesus Christ. Thirteen spires had been completed {{As of|2023|lc=y}}, corresponding to four apostles at the Nativity façade, four apostles at the Passion façade, the four Evangelists, and the Virgin Mary.

The Evangelists&#x27; spires are surmounted by sculptures of their traditional symbols: a winged bull (Saint Luke), a winged man (Saint Matthew), an eagle (Saint John), and a winged lion (Saint Mark). The central spire of Jesus Christ is to be surmounted by a giant cross; its total height ({{convert|172.5|m|ft|sigfig=4}}) will be less than that of Montjuïc hill in Barcelona, as Gaudí believed that his creation should not surpass God&#x27;s. The lower spires are surmounted by communion hosts with sheaves of wheat and chalices with bunches of grapes, representing the Eucharist.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Plans call for tubular bells to be placed within the spires, driven by the force of the wind, and driving sound down into the interior of the church. Gaudí performed acoustic studies to achieve the appropriate acoustic results inside the temple. However, only one bell is currently in place.

The completion of the Jesus Christ spire will make Sagrada Família the tallest church building in the world—{{convert|11|m|sigfig=3}} taller than the current record-holder, Ulm Minster, which is {{convert|161.5|m|ft|sigfig=4}} at its highest point. 

On 29 November 2021, a {{cvt|7|m}} twelve-pointed illuminated crystal star was installed on one of the main towers of the basilica dedicated to the Virgin Mary. 

The construction makes use of post-tensioned stone panels, which are pre-assembled before incorporation into the main structure; using this method has significant structural and operational benefits.

===Façades===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}

The church is designed to have three grand façades: the Nativity façade to the east, the Passion façade to the west, and the Glory façade to the south (incomplete).

The Nativity façade was built before work was interrupted in 1935 and bears the most direct Gaudí influence.

The Passion façade was built according to the design that Gaudi created in 1917. The construction began in 1954, and the steeples, built over the elliptical plan, were finished in 1976. It is especially striking for its spare, gaunt, tormented characters, including emaciated figures of Christ being scourged at the pillar; and Christ on the Cross. These controversial designs are the work of Josep Maria Subirachs.

The Glory façade, on which construction began in 2002, will be the largest and most monumental of the three and will represent one&#x27;s ascension to God. It will also depict various scenes such as Hell, Purgatory, and will include elements such as the seven deadly sins and the seven heavenly virtues.

====Nativity Façade====

Constructed between 1893 and 1936, the Nativity façade was the first façade to be completed.{{Sfn|Faulí|2014|p=42}} Dedicated to the birth of Jesus, it is decorated with scenes reminiscent of elements of life. Characteristic of Gaudí&#x27;s naturalistic style, the sculptures are ornately arranged and decorated with scenes and images from nature, each a symbol in its own manner.{{Sfn|Giralt-Miracle|2012|p=198}} For instance, the three porticos are separated by two large columns, and at the base of each lies a turtle or a tortoise (one to represent the land and the other the sea; each are symbols of time as something set in stone and unchangeable). In contrast to the figures of turtles and their symbolism, two chameleons can be found at either side of the façade and are symbolic of change.
The façade faces the rising sun to the northeast, a symbol for the birth of Christ. It is divided into three porticos, each of which represents a theological virtue (Hope, Faith and Charity). The Tree of Life rises above the door of Jesus in the portico of Charity.{{Sfn|Puig i Boada|1952|p=29}} Four steeples complete the façade and are each dedicated to a Saint (Matthias, Barnabas, Jude the Apostle, and Simon the Zealot).{{Sfn|Faulí|2014|p=42}}

Originally, Gaudí intended for this façade to be polychromed, for each archivolt to be painted with a wide array of colours. He wanted every statue and figure to be painted. In this way the figures of humans would appear as much alive as the figures of plants and animals.

Gaudí chose this façade to embody the structure and decoration of the whole church. He was well aware that he would not finish the church and that he would need to set an artistic and architectural example for others to follow. He also chose for this façade to be the first on which to begin construction and for it to be, in his opinion, the most attractive and accessible to the public. He believed that if he had begun construction with the Passion Façade, one that would be hard and bare (as if made of bones), before the Nativity Façade, people would have withdrawn at the sight of it. Some of the statues were destroyed in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War, and subsequently were reconstructed by the Japanese artist Etsuro Sotoo.

====Passion Façade====

In contrast to the highly decorated Nativity Façade, the Passion Façade is austere, plain and simple, with ample bare stone, and is carved with harsh straight lines to resemble the bones of a skeleton. Dedicated to the Passion of Christ, the suffering of Jesus during his crucifixion, the façade was intended to portray the sins of man. Construction began in 1954, following the drawings and instructions left by Gaudí for future architects and sculptors. The steeples were completed in 1976, and in 1987 a team of sculptors, headed by Josep Maria Subirachs, began work sculpting the various scenes and details of the façade. They aimed to give a rigid, angular form to provoke a dramatic effect. Gaudí intended for this façade to strike fear into the onlooker. He wanted to &quot;break&quot; arcs and &quot;cut&quot; columns, and to use the effect of chiaroscuro (dark angular shadows contrasted by harsh rigid light) to further show the severity and brutality of Christ&#x27;s sacrifice.

Facing the setting sun, indicative and symbolic of the death of Christ, the Passion Façade is supported by six large and inclined columns, designed to resemble strained muscles. Above there is a pyramidal pediment, made up of eighteen bone-shaped columns, which culminate in a large cross with a crown of thorns. Each of the four steeples is dedicated to an apostle (James, Thomas, Philip, and Bartholomew) and, like the Nativity Façade, there are three porticos, each representing the theological virtues, though in a much different light.

The scenes sculpted into the façade may be divided into three levels, which ascend in an &quot;S&quot; form and reproduce the Stations of the Cross (Via Crucis of Christ). The lowest level depicts scenes from Jesus&#x27; last night before the crucifixion, including the Last Supper, Kiss of Judas, Ecce homo, and the Sanhedrin trial of Jesus. The middle level portrays the Calvary, or Golgotha, of Christ, and includes The Three Marys, Saint Longinus, Saint Veronica, and a hollow-face illusion of Christ on the Veil of Veronica. In the third and final level the Death, Burial and the Resurrection of Christ can be seen. A bronze figure situated on a bridge creating a link between the steeples of Saint Bartholomew and Saint Thomas represents the Ascension of Jesus.

The façade contains a magic square based on the magic square in the 1514 print Melencolia I. The square is rotated and one number in each row and column is reduced by one, so the rows and columns add up to 33 instead of the standard 34 for a 4x4 magic square.

====Glory Façade====
The largest and most striking of the façades will be the Glory Façade, on which construction began in 2002. It will be the principal façade and will offer access to the central nave. Dedicated to the Celestial Glory of Jesus, it represents the road to God: Death, Final Judgment, and Glory, while Hell is left for those who deviate from God&#x27;s will. Aware that he would not live long enough to see this façade completed, Gaudí made a model which was demolished in 1936, whose original fragments were used as the basis for the development of the design for the façade. The completion of this façade may require the partial demolition of the block with buildings across the Carrer de Mallorca. The decision was expected to be proposed in May 2023.{{update-inline|date=May 2023}}

To reach the Glory Portico, the large staircase will lead over the underground passage built over Carrer de Mallorca with the decoration representing Hell and vice. On other projects, Carrer de Mallorca will have to go underground. It will be decorated with demons, idols, false gods, heresy and schisms, etc. Purgatory and death will also be depicted, the latter using tombs along the ground. The portico will have seven large columns dedicated to gifts of the Holy Spirit. At the base of the columns there will be representations of the seven deadly sins, and at the top, the seven heavenly virtues.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}
* Gifts: wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety and fear of the Lord.
* Sins: greed, lust, pride, gluttony, sloth, wrath, envy.
* Virtues: kindness, diligence, patience, charity, temperance, humility, chastity.

This façade will have five doors corresponding to the five naves of the temple, with the central one having a triple entrance, that will give the Glory Façade a total seven doors representing the sacraments:
* Baptism
* Confirmation
* Eucharist
* Penance
* Holy orders
* Marriage
* Anointing of the sick{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

In September 2008, the doors of the Glory façade, by Subirachs, were installed. These central doors bear the text of the Our Father prayer in Catalan in high relief, accompanied with the words &quot;Our Father&quot; and &quot;Give us this day our daily bread&quot; inscribed in fifty different languages. The handles of the door are the letters &quot;A&quot; and &quot;G,&quot; forming the initials of Antoni Gaudí, within the phrase {{lang|ca|no permeteu que caiguem en la temptació}} (&quot;lead us not into temptation&quot;).{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

===Interior===
{{For|definitions of the architectural terms|Cathedral floorplan}}
The church plan is that of a Latin cross with five aisles. The central nave vaults reach {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=off|spell=in}} while the side nave vaults reach {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=off|spell=in}}. The transept has three aisles. The columns are on a {{convert|7.5|m|ft}} grid. However, the columns of the apse, resting on del Villar&#x27;s foundation, do not adhere to the grid, requiring a section of columns of the ambulatory to transition to the grid thus creating a horseshoe pattern to the layout of those columns. The crossing rests on the four central columns of porphyry supporting a great hyperboloid surrounded by two rings of twelve hyperboloids (currently under construction). The central vault reaches {{convert|60|m|ft|spell=in}}. The apse is capped by a hyperboloid vault reaching {{convert|75|m|ft|spell=in}}. Gaudí intended that a visitor standing at the main entrance be able to see the vaults of the nave, crossing, and apse, thus the graduated increase in vault loft.

There are gaps in the floor of the apse, providing a view into the crypt below.

The columns of the interior are a unique Gaudí design. Besides branching to support their load, their ever-changing surfaces are the result of the intersection of various geometric forms. The simplest example is that of a square base evolving into an octagon as the column rises, then a sixteen-sided form, and eventually to a circle. This effect is the result of a three-dimensional intersection of helicoidal columns (for example a square cross-section column twisting clockwise and a similar one twisting counterclockwise).

Essentially none of the interior surfaces are flat; the ornamentation is comprehensive and rich, consisting in large part of abstract shapes which combine smooth curves and jagged points. Even detail-level work such as the iron railings for balconies and stairways are full of curvaceous elaboration.
====Organ====
In 2010 an organ was installed in the chancel by the Blancafort Orgueners de Montserrat organ builders. The instrument has 26 stops (1,492 pipes) on two manuals and a pedalboard.

To overcome the unique acoustical challenges posed by the church&#x27;s architecture and vast size, several additional organs will be installed at various points within the building. These instruments will be playable separately (from their own individual consoles) and simultaneously (from a single mobile console), yielding an organ of some 8,000 pipes when completed.

===Geometric details===
{{Further|Mathematics and art}}
The steeples on the Nativity façade are crowned with geometrically shaped tops that are reminiscent of Cubism (they were finished around 1930), and the intricate decoration is contemporary to the style of Art Nouveau, but Gaudí&#x27;s unique style drew primarily from nature, not other artists or architects, and resists categorization.

Gaudí used hyperboloid structures in later designs for Sagrada Família (more obviously after 1914). However, there are a few places on the nativity façade—a design not equated with Gaudí&#x27;s ruled-surface design—where the hyperboloid appears. For example, all around the scene with the pelican, there are numerous examples (including the basket held by one of the figures). There is a hyperboloid adding structural stability to the cypress tree (by connecting it to the bridge). Finally, the &quot;bishop&#x27;s mitre&quot; spires are capped with hyperboloid structures. In his later designs, ruled surfaces are prominent in the nave&#x27;s vaults and windows and the surfaces of the Passion Façade.

===Symbolism===

Themes throughout the decoration include words from the liturgy. The steeples are decorated with words such as &quot;Hosanna&quot;, &quot;Excelsis&quot;, and &quot;Sanctus&quot;; the great doors of the Passion façade reproduce excerpts of the Passion of Jesus from the New Testament in various languages, mainly Catalan; and the Glory façade is to be decorated with the words from the Apostles&#x27; Creed, while its main door reproduces the entire Lord&#x27;s Prayer in Catalan, surrounded by multiple variations of &quot;Give us this day our daily bread&quot; in other languages. The three entrances symbolize the three virtues: Faith, Hope and Love. Each of them is also dedicated to a part of Christ&#x27;s life. The Nativity Façade is dedicated to his birth; it also has a cypress tree which symbolizes the tree of life. The Glory Façade is dedicated to his Christ&#x27;s glory period. The Passion Façade is symbolic of Christ&#x27;s suffering. The apse steeple bears Latin text of the Hail Mary prayer.

Areas of the sanctuary will be designated to represent various concepts, such as saints, virtues and sins, and secular concepts such as regions, presumably with decoration to match.

* Antoni Gaudí

==Appraisal==
The art historian Nikolaus Pevsner, writing in the 1960s, referred to Gaudí&#x27;s buildings as growing &quot;like sugar loaves and anthills&quot; and describes the ornamenting of buildings with shards of broken pottery as possibly &quot;bad taste&quot; but handled with vitality and &quot;ruthless audacity&quot;.

The building&#x27;s design itself has been polarizing. Assessments by Gaudí&#x27;s fellow architects were generally positive; Louis Sullivan greatly admired it, describing Sagrada Família as the &quot;greatest piece of creative architecture in the last twenty-five years. It is spirit symbolised in stone!&quot; Walter Gropius praised Sagrada Família, describing the building&#x27;s walls as &quot;a marvel of technical perfection&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine called it &quot;sensual, spiritual, whimsical, exuberant&quot;. However, author and critic George Orwell, mistakenly referring to it as a cathedral, called it &quot;one of the most hideous buildings in the world&quot;. Author James A. Michener called it &quot;one of the strangest-looking serious buildings in the world&quot; and British historian Gerald Brenan stated about the building &quot;Not even in the European architecture of the period can one discover anything so vulgar or pretentious.&quot; The building&#x27;s distinctive silhouette has nevertheless become symbolic of Barcelona itself, drawing an estimated 3 million visitors annually.

===World Heritage status===
In 1984, UNESCO granted World Heritage Site designations to three Gaudí buildings in Barcelona, though not yet including Sagrada Família, under the collective designation &quot;Works of Antoni Gaudí{{snd}}No 320 bis&quot; (items 320-001 to 320-003), testifying &quot;to Gaudí&#x27;s exceptional creative contribution to the development of architecture and building technology&quot;, &quot;having represented el Modernisme of Catalonia&quot; and &quot;anticipated and influenced many of the forms and techniques that were relevant to the development of modern construction in the 20th century&quot;. In 2005, UNESCO extended the inscription for Works of Antoni Gaudí{{snd}}No 320 bis to include four additional buildings in Barcelona, with item 320-005 listed as two specific sections of Sagrada Família: the Crypt and the Nativity façade.

==Visitor access==
Visitors can access the Nave, Crypt, Museum, Shop, and the Passion and Nativity steeples. Entrance to either of the steeples requires a reservation and advance purchase of a ticket. Access is possible only by lift (elevator) and a short walk up the remainder of the steeples to the bridge between the steeples. Descent is via a very narrow spiral staircase of over 300 steps. There is a posted caution for those with medical conditions.

As of June 2017, online ticket purchase has been available. As of August 2010, there had been a service whereby visitors could buy an entry code either at Servicaixa ATM kiosks (part of CaixaBank) or online.

== International masses ==
The Archdiocese of Barcelona holds an international mass at the Basilica of the Sagrada Família every Sunday and on holy days of obligation.
* Date and time: Every Sunday and on holy days of obligation at 9 am.
* There is no charge for attending mass but capacity is limited.
* Visitors are asked to dress appropriately and behave respectfully.

==Funding and building permit==
Construction on Sagrada Família is not supported by any government or official church sources. Private patrons funded the initial stages. Money from tickets purchased by tourists is now used to pay for the work, and private donations are accepted.

The construction budget for 2009 was €18 million.

In October 2018, Sagrada Família trustees agreed to pay city authorities €36 million for a building permit, after 136 years of unlicensed construction. Most of the funds would be directed to improve the access between the church and the Barcelona Metro. The permit was issued by the city on 7 June 2019.

<text>Dial-up Internet access is a form of Internet access that uses the facilities of the public switched telephone network (PSTN) to establish a connection to an Internet service provider (ISP) by dialing a telephone number on a conventional telephone line which could be connected using an RJ-11 connector. Dial-up connections use modems to decode audio signals into data to send to a router or computer, and to encode signals from the latter two devices to send to another modem at the ISP.

Dial-up Internet reached its peak popularity during the dot-com bubble with the likes of ISPs such as Sprint, EarthLink, MSN Dial-up, NetZero, Prodigy, and America Online (more commonly known as AOL). This was in large part because broadband Internet did not become widely used until well into the 2000s. Since then, most dial-up access has been replaced by broadband.

==History==

In 1979, Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis, graduates of Duke University, created an early predecessor to dial-up Internet access called the Usenet. The Usenet was a UNIX based system that used a dial-up connection to transfer data through telephone modems. 

Dial-up Internet access has existed since the 1980s via public providers such as NSFNET-linked universities in the United States. In the United Kingdom, JANET linked academic users, including a connection to the ARPANET via University College London, while Brunel University and the University of Kent offered dial-up UUCP to non-academic users in the late 1980s.

Commercial dial-up Internet access was first offered in 1989 in the US by the software development company Software Tool &amp; Die, with their service called &quot;The World&quot;. Sprint and AT&amp;T in 1992 also began offering internet access, along with Pipex in the United Kingdom. After the introduction of commercial broadband in the late 1990s, dial-up became less popular. In the United States, the availability of dial-up Internet access dropped from 40% of Americans in the early 2000s to 3% in the early 2010s. It is still used where other forms are not available or where the cost is too high, as in some rural or remote areas.

== Modems ==
Because there was no technology to allow different carrier signals on a telephone line at the time, dial-up Internet access relied on using audio communication. A modem would take the digital data from a computer, modulate it into an audio signal and send it to a receiving modem. This receiving modem would demodulate the signal from modulating analogue noise and demodulating it back into digital data for the computer to process via a modem that would decode the data, and send it to the computer.

The simplicity of this arrangement meant that people would be unable to use their phone line for verbal communication until the Internet call was finished.

The Internet speed using this technology can drop to 21.6 kbit/s or less. Poor condition of the telephone line, high noise level and other factors all affect dial-up speed. For this reason, it is popularly called the 21600 Syndrome.

==Availability==
Dial-up connections to the Internet require no additional infrastructure other than the telephone network and the modems and servers needed to make and answer the calls. Because telephone access is widely available, dial-up is often the only choice available for rural or remote areas, where broadband installations are not prevalent due to low population density and high infrastructure cost. 

A 2008 Pew Research Center study stated that only 10% of US adults still used dial-up Internet access. The study found that the most common reason for retaining dial-up access was high broadband prices. Users cited lack of infrastructure as a reason less often than stating that they would never upgrade to broadband. That number had fallen to 6% by 2010, and to 3% by 2013.

A survey conducted in 2018 estimated that 0.3% of Americans were using dial-up by 2017.

The CRTC estimated that there were 336,000 Canadian dial-up users in 2010.

==Replacement by broadband==
Broadband Internet access via cable, digital subscriber line, wireless broadband, mobile broadband, satellite and FTTx has replaced dial-up access in many parts of the world. Broadband connections typically offer speeds of 700 kbit/s or higher for two-thirds more than the price of dial-up on average. In addition, broadband connections are always on, thus avoiding the need to connect and disconnect at the start and end of each session. Broadband does not require the exclusive use of a phone line, and thus one can access the Internet and at the same time make and receive voice phone calls without having a second phone line.

However, many rural areas remain without high-speed Internet, despite the eagerness of potential customers. This can be attributed to population, location, or sometimes ISPs&#x27; lack of interest due to little chance of profitability and high costs to build the required infrastructure. Some dial-up ISPs have responded to the increased competition by lowering their rates and making dial-up an attractive option for those who merely want email access or basic Web browsing.

Dial-up has seen a significant fall in usage, with the potential to cease to exist in future as more users switch to broadband. In 2013, only about 3% of the U.S population used dial-up, compared to 30% in 2000. One contributing factor is the bandwidth requirements of newer computer programs, like operating systems and antivirus software, which automatically download sizeable updates in the background when a connection to the Internet is first made. These background downloads can take several minutes or longer and, until all updates are completed, they can severely impact the amount of bandwidth available to other applications like Web browsers.

Since an &quot;always on&quot; broadband is the norm expected by most newer applications being developed, this automatic background downloading trend is expected to continue to eat away at dial-up&#x27;s available bandwidth to the detriment of dial-up users&#x27; applications. Many newer websites also now assume broadband speeds as the norm, and when connected to with slower dial-up speeds may drop (timeout) these slower connections to free up communication resources. On websites that are designed to be more dial-up friendly, use of a reverse proxy prevents dial-ups from being dropped as often but can introduce long wait periods for dial-up users caused by the buffering used by a reverse proxy to bridge the different data rates.

Despite the rapid decline, dial-up Internet still exists in some rural areas, and many areas of developing and underdeveloped nations, although wireless and satellite broadband are providing faster connections in many rural areas where fibre or copper may be uneconomical.

In 2010, it was estimated that there were 800,000 dial-up users in the UK. BT turned off its dial-up service in 2013.

In 2012, it was estimated that 7% of Internet connections in New Zealand were dial-up. One NZ (formerly Vodafone) turned off its dial-up service in 2021.

==Performance==
Modern dial-up modems typically have a maximum theoretical transfer speed of 56 kbit/s (using the V.90 or V.92 protocol), although in most cases, 40–50 kbit/s is the norm. Factors such as phone line noise as well as the quality of the modem itself play a large part in determining connection speeds.

Some connections may be as low as 21.6 kbit/s in extremely noisy environments, such as in a hotel room where the phone line is shared with many extensions, or in a rural area, many kilometres from the phone exchange. Other factors such as long loops, loading coils, pair gain, electric fences (usually in rural locations), and digital loop carriers can also slow connections to 21.6 kbit/s or lower. Because of this, it was nicknamed &quot;21600 Syndrome&quot;.
Note that the values given are maximum values, and actual values may be slower under certain conditions (for example, noisy phone lines).


Analog telephone lines are digitally switched and transported inside a Digital Signal 0 once reaching the telephone company&#x27;s equipment. Digital Signal 0 is 64 kbit/s and reserves 8 kbit/s for signaling information; therefore a 56 kbit/s connection is the highest that will ever be possible with analog phone lines.

Dial-up connections usually have latency as high as 150 ms or even more, higher than many forms of broadband, such as cable or DSL, but typically less than satellite connections. Longer latency can make video conferencing and online gaming difficult, if not impossible. An increasing amount of Internet content such as streaming media will not work at dial-up speeds.

Video games released from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s that utilized Internet access such as &quot;EverQuest&quot;, &quot;Red Faction&quot;, &quot;Warcraft 3&quot;, &quot;Final Fantasy XI&quot;, &quot;Phantasy Star Online&quot;, &quot;Guild Wars&quot;, &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Audition&quot;, &quot;Quake 3: Arena&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Ragnarok Online&quot;, etc., accommodated for 56k dial-up with limited data transfer between the game servers and user&#x27;s personal computer. The first consoles to provide Internet connectivity, the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2, supported dial-up as well as broadband. The GameCube could use dial-up and broadband connections, but this was used in very few games and required a separate adapter. The original Xbox exclusively required a broadband connection. Many computer and video games released since 2006 do not even include the option to use dial-up. However, there are exceptions to this, such as &quot;Vendetta Online&quot;, which can still run on a dial-up modem.

===Using compression to exceed 56k===
The V.42, V.42bis and V.44 standards allow modems to accept compressed data at a rate faster than the line rate. These algorithms use data compression to achieve higher throughput.

For instance, a 53.3 kbit/s connection with V.44 can transmit up to 53.3 × 6 = 320 kbit/s if the offered data stream can be compressed that much. However, the compression ratio varies considerably. ZIP archives, JPEG images, MP3, video, etc. are already compressed. A modem might be sending compressed files at approximately 50 kbit/s, uncompressed files at 160 kbit/s, and pure text at 320 kbit/s, or any rate in this range.

====Compression by the ISP====

As telephone-based Internet lost popularity by the mid-2000s, some Internet service providers such as TurboUSA, Netscape, CdotFree, and NetZero started using data compression to increase the perceived speed. As an example, EarthLink advertises &quot;surf the Web up to 7x faster&quot; using a compression program on images, text/html, and SWF flash animations prior to transmission across the phone line.

The pre-compression operates much more efficiently than the on-the-fly compression of V.44 modems. Typically, website text is compacted to 5%, thus increasing effective throughput to approximately 1000 kbit/s, and JPEG/GIF/PNG images are lossy-compressed to 15–20%, increasing effective throughput up to 300 kbit/s.

The drawback of this approach is a loss in quality, where the graphics acquire compression artifacts taking on a blurry or colorless appearance. However, the transfer speed is dramatically improved. If desired, the user may choose to view uncompressed images instead, but at a much slower load rate. Since streaming music and video are already compressed at the source, they are typically passed by the ISP unaltered.

==Usage in other devices==
Other devices, such as satellite receivers and digital video recorders (such as TiVo), have also used a dial-up connection using a household phone socket. This connection allowed to download data at request and to report usage (e.g. ordering pay-per-view) to the service provider. This feature did not require an Internet service provider account – instead, the device&#x27;s internal modem dialed the server of the service provider directly. These devices may experience difficulties when operating on a VoIP line because the compression could alter the modem signal. Later, these devices moved to using an Ethernet connection to the user&#x27;s Internet router, which became a more convenient approach due to the growth in popularity of broadband.

<text>Art Nouveau ( ; ; ), Jugendstil and Secessionsstil in German, is an international style of art, architecture, and applied art, especially the decorative arts. It was often inspired by natural forms such as the sinuous curves of plants and flowers. Other characteristics of Art Nouveau were a sense of dynamism and movement, often given by asymmetry or whiplash lines, and the use of modern materials, particularly iron, glass, ceramics and later concrete, to create unusual forms and larger open spaces. It was popular between 1890 and 1910 during the Belle Époque period, and was a reaction against the academicism, eclecticism and historicism of 19th century architecture and decorative art.

One major objective of Art Nouveau was to break down the traditional distinction between fine arts (especially painting and sculpture) and applied arts. It was most widely used in interior design, graphic arts, furniture, glass art, textiles, ceramics, jewellery and metal work. The style responded to leading 19th century theoreticians, such as French architect Eugène-Emmanuel Viollet-le-Duc (1814–1879) and British art critic John Ruskin (1819–1900). In Britain, it was influenced by William Morris and the Arts and Crafts movement. German architects and designers sought a spiritually uplifting (&#x27;total work of art&#x27;) that would unify the architecture, furnishings, and art in the interior in a common style, to uplift and inspire the residents.

The first Art Nouveau houses and interior decoration appeared in Brussels in the 1890s, in the architecture and interior design of houses designed by Paul Hankar, Henry van de Velde, and especially Victor Horta, whose Hôtel Tassel was completed in 1893. It moved quickly to Paris, where it was adapted by Hector Guimard, who saw Horta&#x27;s work in Brussels and applied the style to the entrances of the new Paris Métro. It reached its peak at the 1900 Paris International Exposition, which introduced the Art Nouveau work of artists such as Louis Tiffany. It appeared in graphic arts in the posters of Alphonse Mucha, and the glassware of René Lalique and Émile Gallé.

From Britain, Art Nouveau spread to Belgium onto Spain and France, and the to the rest of Europe, taking on different names and characteristics in each country (see Naming section below). It often appeared not only in capitals, but also in rapidly growing cities that wanted to establish artistic identities (Turin and Palermo in Italy; Glasgow in Scotland; Munich and Darmstadt in Germany; Barcelona in Catalonia, Spain), as well as in centres of independence movements (Helsinki in Finland, then part of the Russian Empire).

By 1914, with the beginning of the First World War, Art Nouveau was largely exhausted. In the 1920s, it was replaced as the dominant architectural and decorative art style by Art Deco and then Modernism. The Art Nouveau style began to receive more positive attention from critics in the late 1960s, with a major exhibition of the work of Hector Guimard at the Museum of Modern Art in 1970.

==Naming==
The term &quot;Art Nouveau&quot; was first used in the 1880s in the Belgian journal &quot;L&#x27;Art Moderne&quot; to describe the work of &quot;Les Vingt&quot;, twenty painters and sculptors seeking reform through art. The name was popularized by the (&#x27;House of the New Art&#x27;), an art gallery opened in Paris in 1895 by the Franco-German art dealer Siegfried Bing. In Britain, the French term was commonly used, while in France, it was often called by the term (akin to the British term &quot;Modern Style&quot;), or . In France, it was also sometimes called (after the novelist Jules Verne), (after Hector Guimard&#x27;s iron and glass subway entrances), , or .

Art Nouveau is known by different names in different languages: in German, in Italian, in Catalan, and also known as the Modern Style in English. The style is often related to, but not always identical with, styles that emerged in many countries in Europe and elsewhere at about the same time. Their local names were often used in their respective countries to describe the whole movement.

* In Austria and the neighbouring countries then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, it was called (&#x27;Viennese youth style&#x27;), or (&#x27;Secession style&#x27;), after the artists of the Vienna Secession (, , , ).
* In Belgium, it was sometimes termed (&#x27;Whiplash style&#x27;), (&#x27;Eel Style&#x27;), or (&#x27;Noodle style&#x27;) by its detractors.
* In Britain, besides Art Nouveau, it was known as the &quot;Modern Style&quot;, or, because of the works of the Glasgow School, as the &quot;Glasgow style&quot;. 
* In Denmark, it is known as (&#x27;Work of beauty&#x27;).
* In Germany and Scandinavia, it was called (&#x27;Reform style&#x27;), or (&#x27;Youth style&#x27;), after the popular German art magazine , as well as (&#x27;Wave style&#x27;), or (&#x27;Lily style&#x27;). It is now called &quot;Jugend&quot; in Finland, Sweden, and Norway; in Estonia; and in Latvia. In Finland, it was also called .
* In Italy, it was often called (&#x27;Liberty style&#x27;), after Arthur Lasenby Liberty, the founder of London&#x27;s Liberty &amp; Co, whose textile designs were popular. It was also sometimes called (&#x27;floral style&#x27;) or (&#x27;new art&#x27;; not in use anymore).
* In Japan, &quot;Shiro-Uma&quot;.
* In the Netherlands, (&#x27;New Art&#x27;), or (&#x27;New style&#x27;).
* In Poland, (&#x27;Secession&#x27;).
* In Portugal, (&#x27;New Art&#x27;).
* In Romania, (&#x27;1900 Art&#x27;), (&#x27;New Art&#x27;), or (&#x27;New Style&#x27;).
* In Spain, , (in Catalan) and (&#x27;Young art&#x27;).
* In Switzerland, (&#x27;fir-tree style&#x27;).
* In the United States, due to its association with Louis Comfort Tiffany, it was sometimes called the &quot;Tiffany style&quot;.
* The term &quot;Modern&quot; was used in then Russian Empire and still used in current successor states such as Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine, while it is called in Lithuania. For painting, the name of the &quot;Mir Iskusstva&quot; (&#x27;World of Art&#x27;) movement was also used.

==History==
===Origins===
The new art movement had its roots in Britain, in the floral designs of William Morris, and in the Arts and Crafts movement founded by the pupils of Morris. Early prototypes of the style include the Red House with interiors by Morris and architecture by Philip Webb (1859), and the lavish Peacock Room by James Abbott McNeill Whistler. The new movement was also strongly influenced by the Pre-Raphaelite painters, including Dante Gabriel Rossetti and Edward Burne-Jones, and especially by British graphic artists of the 1880s, including Selwyn Image, Heywood Sumner, Walter Crane, Alfred Gilbert, and especially Aubrey Beardsley. The chair designed by Arthur Mackmurdo has been recognized as a precursor of Art Nouveau design.

In France, it was influenced by the architectural theorist and historian Eugène Viollet-le-Duc, a declared enemy of the historical Beaux-Arts architectural style, whose theories on rationalism were derived from his study of medieval art:
* Function should define form.
* Unity of the arts and the abolition of any distinction between major art (architecture) and minor arts (decorative arts).
* Nature&#x27;s logic is the model to be used for architecture.
* Architecture should adapt itself to man&#x27;s environment and needs.
* Use of modern technologies and materials.
Viollet-le-Duc was himself a precursor of Art Nouveau: in 1851, at Notre-Dame de Paris, he created a series of mural paintings typical of the style. These paintings were removed in 1945 as deemed non academic. At the Château de Roquetaillade in the Bordeaux region, his interior decorations dating from 1865 also anticipate Art Nouveau. In his 1872 book &quot;Entretiens sur l&#x27;architecture&quot;, he wrote, &quot;Use the means and knowledge given to us by our times, without the intervening traditions which are no longer viable today, and in that way we can inaugurate a new architecture. For each function its material; for each material its form and its ornament.&quot; This book influenced a generation of architects, including Louis Sullivan, Victor Horta, Hector Guimard, and Antoni Gaudí.

The French painters Maurice Denis, Pierre Bonnard and Édouard Vuillard played an important part in integrating fine arts painting with decoration. &quot;I believe that before everything a painting must decorate&quot;, Denis wrote in 1891. &quot;The choice of subjects or scenes is nothing. It is by the value of tones, the coloured surface and the harmony of lines that I can reach the spirit and wake up the emotions.&quot; These painters all did both traditional painting and decorative painting on screens, in glass, and in other media.

Another important influence on the new style was Japonism. This was a wave of enthusiasm for Japanese woodblock printing, particularly the works of Hiroshige, Hokusai, and Utagawa Kunisada, which were imported into Europe beginning in the 1870s. The enterprising Siegfried Bing founded a monthly journal, &quot;Le Japon artistique&quot; in 1888, and published thirty-six issues before it ended in 1891. It influenced both collectors and artists, including Gustav Klimt. The stylised features of Japanese prints appeared in Art Nouveau graphics, porcelain, jewellery, and furniture. Since the beginning of 1860, a Far Eastern influence suddenly manifested. In 1862, art lovers from London or Paris, could buy Japanese artworks, because in that year, Japan appeared for the first time as an exhibitor at the International Exhibition in London. Also in 1862, in Paris, &quot;La Porte Chinoise&quot; store, on Rue de Rivoli, was open, where Japanese ukiyo-e and other objects from the Far East were sold. In 1867, &quot;Examples of Chinese Ornaments&quot; by Owen Jones appeared, and in 1870 &quot;Art and Industries in Japan&quot; by R. Alcock, and two years later, O. H. Moser and T. W. Cutler published books about Japanese art. Some Art Nouveau artists, like Victor Horta, owned a collection of Far Eastern art, especially Japanese.

New technologies in printing and publishing allowed Art Nouveau to quickly reach a global audience. Art magazines, illustrated with photographs and colour lithographs, played an essential role in popularizing the new style. &quot;The Studio&quot; in England, &quot;Arts et idèes&quot; and &quot;Art et décoration&quot; in France, and &quot;Jugend&quot; in Germany allowed the style to spread rapidly to all corners of Europe. Aubrey Beardsley in England, and Eugène Grasset, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and Félix Vallotton achieved international recognition as illustrators.
With the posters by Jules Chéret for dancer Loie Fuller in 1893, and by Alphonse Mucha for actress Sarah Bernhardt in 1895, the poster became not just advertising, but an art form. Sarah Bernhardt set aside large numbers of her posters for sale to collectors.

===Development – Brussels (1893–1898)===

The first Art Nouveau town houses, the Hankar House by Paul Hankar (1893) and the Hôtel Tassel by Victor Horta (1892–1893), were built almost simultaneously in Brussels. They were similar in their originality, but very different in their design and appearance.

Victor Horta was among the most influential architects of early Art Nouveau, and his Hôtel Tassel (1892–1893) in Brussels is one of the style&#x27;s landmarks. Horta&#x27;s architectural training was as an assistant to Alphonse Balat, architect to King Leopold II, constructing the monumental iron and glass Royal Greenhouses of Laeken. He was a great admiror of Viollet-le-Duc, with whose ideas he completely identified. In 1892–1893, he put this experience to a very different use. He designed the residence of a prominent Belgian chemist, Émile Tassel, on a very narrow and deep site. The central element of the house was the stairway, not enclosed by walls, but open, decorated with a curling wrought-iron railing, and placed beneath a high skylight. The floors were supported by slender iron columns like the trunks of trees. The mosaic floors and walls were decorated with delicate arabesques in floral and vegetal forms, which became the most popular signature of the style. In a short period, Horta built three more town houses, all with open interiors, and all with skylights for maximum interior light: the Hôtel Solvay, the Hôtel van Eetvelde (for Edmond van Eetvelde), and the Maison &amp; Atelier Horta. All four are now part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

Paul Hankar was also an innovator of early Art Nouveau. Born at Frameries, in Hainaut, the son of a master stone cutter, he had studied ornamental sculpture and decoration at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Brussels from 1873 to 1884, whilst working as an ornamental sculptor. From 1879 to 1894, he worked in the studio of the prominent architect Henri Beyaert, a master of eclectic and neoclassical architecture. Through Beyaert, Hankar also became an admirer of Viollet-le-Duc. In 1893, Hankar designed and built the Hankar House, his own residence in Brussels. With a goal to create a synthesis of fine arts and decorative arts, he brought together the sculptor René Janssens and the painter Albert Ciamberlani to decorate the interior and exterior with sgraffiti, or murals. The façade and balconies featured iron decoration and curling lines in stylised floral patterns, which became an important feature of Art Nouveau. Based on this model, he built several houses for his artist friends. He also designed a series of innovative glass display windows for Brussels shops, restaurants and galleries, in what a local critic called &quot;a veritable delirium of originality&quot;. He died in 1901, just as the movement was beginning to receive recognition.

Henry van de Velde, born in Antwerp, was another founding figure in the birth of Art Nouveau. Van de Velde&#x27;s designs included the interior of his residence in Brussels, the Villa Bloemenwerf (1895). The exterior of the house was inspired by the Red House, the residence of writer and theorist William Morris, the founder of the Arts and Crafts movement. Trained as a painter, Van de Velde turned to illustration, then to furniture design, and finally to architecture. For the Villa Bloemenwerf, he created the textiles, wallpaper, silverware, jewellery, and even clothing, that matched the style of the residence. Van de Velde went to Paris, where he designed furniture and decoration for the German-French art dealer Siegfried Bing, whose Paris gallery gave the style its name. He was also an early Art Nouveau theorist, demanding the use of dynamic, often opposing lines. Van de Velde wrote: &quot;A line is a force like all the other elementary forces. Several lines put together but opposed have a presence as strong as several forces&quot;. In 1906, he departed Belgium for Weimar (Germany), where he founded the Grand-Ducal School of Arts and Crafts, where the teaching of historical styles was forbidden. He played an important role in the German Werkbund, before returning to Belgium.

The debut of Art Nouveau architecture in Brussels was accompanied by a wave of Decorative Art in the new style. Important artists included Gustave Strauven, who used wrought iron to achieve baroque effects on Brussels façades; the furniture designer Gustave Serrurier-Bovy, known for his highly original chairs and articulated metal furniture; and the jewellery designer Philippe Wolfers, who made jewellery in the form of dragonflies, butterflies, swans and serpents.

The Brussels International Exposition held in 1897 brought international attention to the style; Horta, Hankar, Van de Velde, and Serrurier-Bovy, among others, took part in the design of the fair, and Henri Privat-Livemont created the poster for the exhibition.

===Paris – Maison de l&#x27;Art Nouveau (1895) and Castel Beranger (1895–1898)===
The Franco-German art dealer and publisher Siegfried Bing played a key role in publicizing the style. In 1891, he founded a magazine devoted to the art of Japan, which helped publicize Japonism in Europe. In 1892, he organized an exhibit of seven artists, among them Pierre Bonnard, Félix Vallotton, Édouard Vuillard, Toulouse-Lautrec and Eugène Grasset, which included both modern painting and decorative work. This exhibition was shown at the Société nationale des beaux-arts in 1895. In the same year, Bing opened a new gallery at 22 rue de Provence in Paris, the Maison de l&#x27;Art Nouveau, devoted to new works in both the fine and decorative arts. The interior and furniture of the gallery were designed by the Belgian architect Henry van de Velde, one of the pioneers of Art Nouveau architecture. The &quot;Maison de l&#x27;Art Nouveau&quot; showed paintings by Georges Seurat, Paul Signac and Toulouse-Lautrec, glass from Louis Comfort Tiffany and Émile Gallé, jewellery by René Lalique, and posters by Aubrey Beardsley. The works shown there were not at all uniform in style. Bing wrote in 1902, &quot;Art Nouveau, at the time of its creation, did not aspire in any way to have the honor of becoming a generic term. It was simply the name of a house opened as a rallying point for all the young and ardent artists impatient to show the modernity of their tendencies.&quot;

The style was quickly noticed in neighbouring France. After visiting Horta&#x27;s Hôtel Tassel, Hector Guimard built the Castel Béranger, among the first Paris buildings in the new style, between 1895 and 1898. Parisians had been complaining of the monotony of the architecture of the boulevards built under Napoleon III by Georges-Eugène Haussmann. The Castel Beranger was a curious blend of Neo-Gothic and Art Nouveau, with curving whiplash lines and natural forms. Guimard, a skilled publicist for his work, declared: &quot;What must be avoided at all cost is...the parallel and symmetry. Nature is the greatest builder of all, and nature makes nothing that is parallel and nothing that is symmetric.&quot;

Parisians welcomed Guimard&#x27;s original and picturesque style; the Castel Béranger was chosen as one of the best new façades in Paris, launching Guimard&#x27;s career. Guimard was given the commission to design the entrances for the new Paris Métro system, which brought the style to the attention of the millions of visitors to the city&#x27;s 1900 .

===Paris &quot;Exposition Universelle&quot; (1900)===

The Paris 1900 &quot;Exposition universelle&quot; marked the high point of Art Nouveau. Between April and November 1900, it attracted nearly fifty million visitors from around the world, and showcased the architecture, design, glassware, furniture and decorative objects of the style. The architecture of the Exposition was often a mixture of Art Nouveau and Beaux-Arts architecture: the main exhibit hall, the Grand Palais had a Beaux-Arts façade completely unrelated to the spectacular Art Nouveau stairway and exhibit hall in the interior.

French designers all made special works for the Exhibition: Lalique crystal and jewellery; jewellery by Henri Vever and Georges Fouquet; Daum glass; the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres in porcelain; ceramics by Alexandre Bigot; sculpted glass lamps and vases by Émile Gallé; furniture by Édouard Colonna and Louis Majorelle; and many other prominent arts and crafts firms. At the 1900 Paris Exposition, Siegfried Bing presented a pavilion called &quot; Art Nouveau Bing&quot;, which featured six different interiors entirely decorated in the Style.

The Exposition was the first international showcase for Art Nouveau designers and artists from across Europe and beyond. Prize winners and participants included Alphonse Mucha, who made murals for the pavilion of Bosnia-Herzegovina and designed the menu for the restaurant of the pavilion; the decorators and designers Bruno Paul and Bruno Möhring from Berlin; Carlo Bugatti from Turin; Bernhardt Pankok from Bavaria; The Russian architect-designer Fyodor Schechtel, and Louis Comfort Tiffany and Company from the United States. The Viennese architect Otto Wagner was a member of the jury, and presented a model of the Art Nouveau bathroom of his own town apartment in Vienna, featuring a glass bathtub. Josef Hoffmann designed the Viennese exhibit at the Paris exposition, highlighting the designs of the Vienna Secession. Eliel Saarinen first won international recognition for his imaginative design of the pavilion of Finland.

While the Paris Exposition was by far the largest, other expositions did much to popularize the style. The 1888 Barcelona Universal Exposition marked the beginning of the Modernisme style in Spain, with some buildings of Lluís Domènech i Montaner. The &quot;Esposizione internazionale d&#x27;arte decorativa moderna&quot; of 1902 in Turin, Italy, showcased designers from across Europe, including Victor Horta from Belgium and Joseph Maria Olbrich from Vienna, along with local artists such as Carlo Bugatti, Galileo Chini and Eugenio Quarti.

==Local variations==
===Art Nouveau in France===

Following the 1900 Exposition, the capital of Art Nouveau was Paris. The most extravagant residences in the style were built by Jules Lavirotte, who entirely covered the façades with ceramic sculptural decoration. The most flamboyant example is the Lavirotte Building, at 29, (1901). Office buildings and department stores featured high courtyards covered with stained glass cupolas and ceramic decoration. The style was particularly popular in restaurants and cafés, including &quot;Maxim&#x27;s&quot; at 3, &quot;rue Royale&quot;, and &quot;Le Train bleu&quot; at the Gare de Lyon (1900).

The status of Paris attracted foreign artists to the city. The Swiss-born artist Eugène Grasset was one of the first creators of French Art Nouveau posters. He helped decorate the famous cabaret Le Chat Noir in 1885, made his first posters for the &quot;Fêtes de Paris&quot; and a celebrated poster of Sarah Bernhardt in 1890. In Paris, he taught at the Guérin school of art (&quot;École normale d&#x27;enseignement du dessin&quot;), where his students included Augusto Giacometti and Paul Berthon. Swiss-born Théophile-Alexandre Steinlen created the famous poster for the Paris cabaret &quot;Le Chat noir&quot; in 1896. The Czech artist Alphonse Mucha (1860–1939) arrived in Paris in 1888, and in 1895, made a poster for actress Sarah Bernhardt in the play &quot;Gismonda&quot; by Victorien Sardou in Théâtre de la Renaissance. The success of this poster led to a contract to produce posters for six more plays by Bernhardt.

The city of Nancy in Lorraine became the other French capital of the new style. In 1901, the &quot;Alliance provinciale des industries d&#x27;art&quot;, also known as the &quot;École de Nancy&quot;, was founded, dedicated to upsetting the hierarchy that put painting and sculpture above the decorative arts. The major artists working there included the glass vase and lamp creators Émile Gallé, the Daum brothers in glass design, and the designer Louis Majorelle, who created furniture with graceful floral and vegetal forms. The architect Henri Sauvage brought the new architectural style to Nancy with his Villa Majorelle in 1902.

The French style was widely propagated by new magazines, including &quot;The Studio&quot;, &quot;Arts et Idées&quot; and &quot;Art et Décoration&quot;, whose photographs and colour lithographs made the style known to designers and wealthy clients around the world.

In France, the style reached its summit in 1900, and thereafter slipped rapidly out of fashion, virtually disappearing from France by 1905. Art Nouveau was a luxury style, which required expert and highly-paid craftsmen, and could not be easily or cheaply mass-produced. One of the few Art Nouveau products that could be mass-produced was the perfume bottle, and these are still manufactured in the style today.

===Art Nouveau in Belgium===

Belgium was an early centre of Art Nouveau, thanks largely to the architecture of Victor Horta, who designed one of the first Art Nouveau houses, the Hôtel Tassel in 1893, and three other townhouses in variations of the same style. They are now UNESCO World Heritage sites. Horta had a strong influence on the work of the young Hector Guimard, who came to see the Hôtel Tassel under construction, and later declared that Horta was the &quot;inventor&quot; of the Art Nouveau. Horta&#x27;s innovation was not the façade, but the interior, using an abundance of iron and glass to open up space and flood the rooms with light, and decorating them with wrought iron columns and railings in curving vegetal forms, which were echoed on the floors and walls, as well as the furniture and carpets which Horta designed.

Paul Hankar was another pioneer of Brussels&#x27; Art Nouveau. His house was completed in 1893, the same year as Horta&#x27;s Hôtel Tassel, and featured sgraffiti murals on the façade. Hankar was influenced by both Viollet-le-Duc and the ideas of the English Arts and Crafts movement. His conception idea was to bring together decorative and fine arts in a coherent whole. He commissioned the sculptor Alfred Crick and the painter to decorate the façades of houses with their work. The most striking example was the house and studio built for the artist Albert Ciamberlani at 48, / in Brussels, for which he created an exuberant façade covered with sgraffito murals with painted figures and ornament, recreating the decorative architecture of the Quattrocento, or 15th-century Italy. Hankar died in 1901, when his work was just receiving recognition.

Gustave Strauven began his career as an assistant designer working with Horta, before he started his own practice at age 21, making some of the most extravagant Art Nouveau buildings in Brussels. His most famous work is the Saint-Cyr House at 11, /. The house is only wide, but is given extraordinary height by his elaborate architectural inventions. It is entirely covered by polychrome bricks and a network of curling vegetal forms in wrought iron, in a virtually Art Nouveau-Baroque style.

Other important Art Nouveau artists from Belgium included the architect and designer Henry van de Velde, though the most important part of his career was spent in Germany; he strongly influenced the decoration of the Jugendstil. Others included the decorator Gustave Serrurier-Bovy, and the graphic artist Fernand Khnopff. Belgian designers took advantage of an abundant supply of ivory imported from the Belgian Congo; mixed sculptures, combining stone, metal and ivory, by such artists as Philippe Wolfers, was popular.

===&quot;Nieuwe Kunst&quot; in the Netherlands===
In the Netherlands, the style was known as the (&#x27;New Style&#x27;), or (&#x27;New Art&#x27;), and it took a different direction from the more floral and curving style in Belgium. It was influenced by the more geometric and stylised forms of the German Jugendstil and Austrian Vienna Secession. It was also influenced by the art and imported woods from Indonesia, then the Dutch East Indies, particularly the designs of the textiles and batik from Java.

The most important architect and furniture designer in the style was Hendrik Petrus Berlage, who denounced historical styles and advocated a purely functional architecture. He wrote, &quot;It is necessary to fight against the art of illusion, to and to recognize the lie, in order to find the essence and not the illusion.&quot; Like Victor Horta and Gaudí, he was an admirer of architectural theories of Viollet-le-Duc. His furniture was designed to be strictly functional, and to respect the natural forms of wood, rather than bending or twisting it as if it were metal. He pointed to the example of Egyptian furniture, and preferred chairs with right angles. His first and most famous architectural work was the Beurs van Berlage (1896–1903), the Amsterdam Commodities Exchange, which he built following the principles of constructivism. Everything was functional, including the lines of rivets that decorated the walls of the main room. He often included very tall towers to his buildings to make them more prominent, a practice used by other Art Nouveau architects of the period, including Joseph Maria Olbrich in Vienna and Eliel Saarinen in Finland.

Other buildings in the style include the American Hotel (1898–1900), also by Berlage; and Astoria (1904–1905) by Herman Hendrik Baanders and Gerrit van Arkel in Amsterdam; the railway station in Haarlem (1906–1908), and the former office building of the Holland America Lines (1917) in Rotterdam, now the Hotel New York.

Prominent graphic artists and illustrators in the style included Jan Toorop, whose work inclined toward mysticism and symbolism, even in his posters for salad oil. In their colors and designs, they also sometimes showed the influence of the art of Java.

Important figures in Dutch ceramics and porcelain included Jurriaan Kok and Theo Colenbrander. They used colorful floral pattern and more traditional Art Nouveau motifs, combined with unusual forms of pottery and contrasting dark and light colors, borrowed from the batik decoration of Java.

===Modern Style and Glasgow School in Britain===


Art Nouveau had its roots in Britain, in the Arts and Crafts movement which started in the 1860s and reached international recognition by the 1880s. It called for better treatment of decorative arts, and took inspiration in medieval craftmanship and design, and nature. One notable early example of the Modern Style is Arthur Mackmurdo&#x27;s design for the cover of his essay on the city churches of Sir Christopher Wren, published in 1883, as is his Mahogany chair from the same year.

Other important innovators in Britain included the graphic designers Aubrey Beardsley whose drawings featured the curved lines that became the most recognizable feature of the style. Free-flowing wrought iron from the 1880s could also be adduced, or some flat floral textile designs, most of which owed some impetus to patterns of 19th century design. Other British graphic artists who had an important place in the style included Walter Crane and Charles Ashbee.

The Liberty department store in London played an important role, through its colourful stylised floral designs for textiles, and the silver, pewter, and jewellery designs of Manxman (of Scottish descent) Archibald Knox. His jewellery designs in materials and forms broke away entirely from the historical traditions of jewellery design.

For Art Nouveau architecture and furniture design, the most important centre in Britain was Glasgow, with the creations of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and the Glasgow School, whose work was inspired by Scottish baronial architecture and Japanese design. Beginning in 1895, Mackintosh displayed his designs at international expositions in London, Vienna, and Turin; his designs particularly influenced the Secession Style in Vienna. His architectural creations included the Glasgow Herald Building (1894) and the library of the Glasgow School of Art (1897). He also established a major reputation as a furniture designer and decorator, working closely with his wife, Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh, a prominent painter and designer. Together they created striking designs that combined geometric straight lines with gently curving floral decoration, particularly a famous symbol of the style, the Glasgow Rose&quot;.

Léon-Victor Solon, made an important contribution to Art Nouveau ceramics as art director at Mintons. He specialised in plaques and in tube-lined vases marketed as &quot;secessionist ware&quot; (usually described as named after the Viennese art movement). Apart from ceramics, he designed textiles for the Leek silk industry and doublures for a bookbinder (G.T.Bagguley of Newcastle-under-Lyme), who patented the &quot;Sutherland&quot; binding in 1895.

George Skipper was perhaps the most active Art Nouveau architect in England. The Edward Everard building in Bristol, built during 1900–01 to house the printing works of Edward Everard, features an Art Nouveau façade. The figures depicted are of Johannes Gutenberg and William Morris, both eminent in the field of printing. A winged figure symbolises the &quot;Spirit of Light&quot;, while a figure holding a lamp and mirror symbolises light and truth.

===&quot;Jugendstil&quot; in Germany===

German Art Nouveau is commonly known by its German name, , or &#x27;Youth Style&#x27;. The name is taken from the artistic journal, (&#x27;Youth&#x27;), which was published in Munich. The magazine was founded in 1896 by Georg Hirth, who remained editor until his death in 1916. The magazine survived until 1940. During the early 20th century, &quot;Jugendstil&quot; was applied only to the graphic arts. It referred especially to the forms of typography and graphic design found in German magazines such as &quot;Jugend&quot;, &quot;Pan&quot;, and &quot;Simplicissimus&quot;. &quot;Jugendstil&quot; was later applied to other versions of Art Nouveau in Germany, the Netherlands. The term was borrowed from German by several languages of the Baltic states and Nordic countries to describe Art Nouveau (see Naming section).

In 1892 Georg Hirth chose the name Munich Secession for the Association of Visual Artists of Munich. The Vienna Secession, founded in 1897, and the Berlin Secession also took their names from the Munich group.

The journals &quot;Jugend&quot; and &quot;Simplicissimus&quot;, published in Munich, and &quot;Pan&quot;, published in Berlin, were important proponents of the &quot;Jugendstil&quot;. &quot;Jugendstil&quot; art combined sinuous curves and more geometric lines, and was used for covers of novels, advertisements, and exhibition posters. Designers often created original styles of typeface that worked harmoniously with the image, e.g. Arnold Böcklin typeface in 1904.

Otto Eckmann was one of the most prominent German artists associated with both &quot;Die Jugend&quot; and &quot;Pan&quot;. His favourite animal was the swan, and so great was his influence that the swan came to serve as the symbol of the entire movement. Another prominent designer in the style was Richard Riemerschmid, who made furniture, pottery, and other decorative objects in a sober, geometric style that pointed forward toward Art Deco. The Swiss artist Hermann Obrist, living in Munich, illustrated the &quot;coup de fouet&quot; or whiplash motif, a highly stylised double curve suggesting motion taken from the stem of the cyclamen flower.

The Darmstadt Artists&#x27; Colony was founded in 1899 by Ernest Ludwig, Grand Duke of Hesse. The architect who built Grand Duke&#x27;s house, as well as the largest structure of the colony (Wedding tower), was Joseph Maria Olbrich, one of the Vienna Secession founders. Other notable artists of the colony were Peter Behrens and Hans Christiansen. Ernest Ludwig also commissioned to rebuild the spa complex in Bad Nauheim at the beginning of century. A completely new complex was constructed in 1905–1911 under the direction of and attained one of the main objectives of Jugendstil: a synthesis of all the arts.
Another member of the reigning family who commissioned an Art Nouveau structure was Princess Elisabeth of Hesse and by Rhine. She founded Marfo-Mariinsky Convent in Moscow in 1908 and its katholikon is recognized as an Art Nouveau masterpiece.

Another notable union in German Empire was the Deutscher Werkbund, founded in 1907 in Munich at the instigation of Hermann Muthesius by artists of Darmstadt Colony Joseph Maria Olbrich, Peter Behrens; by another founder of Vienna Secession Josef Hoffmann, as well as by Wiener Werkstätte (founded by Hoffmann), by Richard Riemerschmid, Bruno Paul and other artists and companies. Later Belgian Henry van de Velde joined the movement. The , founded by him in Weimar, was a predecessor of Bauhaus, one of the most influential currents in Modernist architecture.

In Berlin, Jugendstil was chosen for the construction of several railway stations. The most notable is Bülowstraße by Bruno Möhring (1900–1902), other examples are Mexikoplatz (1902–1904), Botanischer Garten (1908–1909), Frohnau (1908–1910), Wittenbergplatz (1911–1913) and Pankow (1912–1914) stations. Another notable structure of Berlin is Hackesche Höfe (1906) which used polychrome glazed brick for the courtyard façade.

Art Nouveau in Strasbourg (then part of the German Empire as the capital of the &quot;Reichsland Elsaß-Lothringen&quot;) was a specific brand, in that it combined influences from Nancy and Brussels, with influences from Darmstadt and Vienna, to operate a local synthesis which reflected the history of the city between the Germanic and the French realms.

===Secession in Austria–Hungary===
====Vienna Secession====

Vienna became the centre of a distinct variant of Art Nouveau, which became known as the Vienna Secession. The movement took its name from Munich Secession established in 1892. Vienna Secession was founded in April 1897 by a group of artists that included Gustav Klimt, Koloman Moser, Josef Hoffmann, Joseph Maria Olbrich, Max Kurzweil, Ernst Stöhr, and others. The painter Klimt became the president of the group. They objected to the conservative orientation toward historicism expressed by Vienna Künstlerhaus, the official union of artists. The Secession founded a magazine, &quot;Ver Sacrum&quot;, to promote their works in all media. The architect Joseph Olbrich designed the domed Secession building in the new style, which became a showcase for the paintings of Gustav Klimt and other Secession artists.

Klimt became the best-known of the Secession painters, often erasing the border between fine art painting and decorative painting. Koloman Moser was an extremely versatile artist in the style; his work including magazine illustrations, architecture, silverware, ceramics, porcelain, textiles, stained glass windows, and furniture.

The most prominent architect of the Vienna Secession was Otto Wagner, he joined the movement soon after its inception to follow his students Hoffmann and Olbrich. His major projects included several stations of the urban rail network (the Stadtbahn), the Linke Wienzeile Buildings (consisting of Majolica House, the House of Medallions and the house at Köstlergasse). The Karlsplatz Station is now an exhibition hall of the Vienna Museum. The Kirche am Steinhof of Steinhof Psychiatric hospital (1904–1907) is a unique and finely-crafted example of Secession religious architecture, with a traditional domed exterior but sleek, modern gold and white interior lit by abundance of modern stained glass.

In 1899 Joseph Maria Olbrich moved to Darmstadt Artists&#x27; Colony, in 1903 Koloman Moser and Josef Hoffmann founded the Wiener Werkstätte, a training school and workshop for designers and craftsmen of furniture, carpets, textiles and decorative objects. In 1905 Koloman Moser and Gustav Klimt separated from Vienna Secession, later in 1907 Koloman Moser left Wiener Werkstätte as well, while its other founder Josef Hoffmann joined the Deutscher Werkbund. Gustav Klimt and Josef Hoffmann continued collaborating, they organized in 1908 in Vienna and built the Stoclet Palace in Brussels (1905–1911) that announced the coming of modernist architecture. It was designated as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in June 2009.

====Hungarian &quot;Szecesszió&quot;====
The pioneer and prophet of the (&#x27;Secession&#x27; in Hungarian), the architect Ödön Lechner, created buildings which marked a transition from historicism to modernism for Hungarian architecture.
His idea for a Hungarian architectural style was the use of architectural ceramics and oriental motifs. In his works, he used pygorganite placed in production by 1886 by Zsolnay Porcelain Manufactory. This material was used in the construction of notable Hungarian buildings of other styles, e.g. the Hungarian Parliament Building and Matthias Church.

Works by Ödön Lechner include the Museum of Applied Arts (1893–1896), other building with similar distinctive features are Geological Museum (1896–1899) and The Postal Savings Bank building (1899–1902), all in Budapest. However, due to the opposition of Hungarian architectural establishment to Lechner&#x27;s success, he soon was unable to get new commissions comparable to his earlier buildings. But Lechner was an inspiration and a master to the following generation of architects who played the main role in popularising the new style. Within the process of Magyarization numerous buildings were commissioned to his disciples in outskirts of the kingdom: e.g. and Dezső Jakab were commissioned to build the Synagogue (1901–1903) and Town Hall (1908–1910) in Szabadka (now Subotica, Serbia), County Prefecture (1905–1907) and Palace of Culture (1911–1913) in Marosvásárhely (now Târgu Mureș, Romania). Later Lechner himself built the Blue Church in Pozsony (present-day Bratislava, Slovakia) in 1909–1913.

Another important architect was Károly Kós who was a follower of John Ruskin and William Morris. Kós took the Finnish National Romanticism movement as a model and the Transylvanian vernacular as the inspiration. His most notable buildings include the Roman Catholic Church in Zebegény (1908–09), pavilions for the Budapest Municipal Zoo (1909–1912) and the Székely National Museum in Sepsiszentgyörgy (now Sfântu Gheorghe, Romania, 1911–12).

The movement that promoted Szecesszió in arts was Gödöllő Art Colony, founded by Aladár Körösfői-Kriesch, also a follower John Ruskin and William Morris and a professor at the Royal School of Applied Arts in Budapest in 1901. Its artists took part in many projects, including the Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest.

An associate to Gödöllő Art Colony, Miksa Róth was also involved in several dozen Szecesszió projects, including Budapest buildings including Gresham Palace (stained glass, 1906) and (mosaics, 1906) and also created mosaics and stained glass for Palace of Culture (1911–1913) in Marosvásárhely.

A notable furniture designer is who combined traditional popular architecture, oriental architecture and international Art Nouveau in a highly picturesque style. , another Hungarian designer, had a much more sober and functional style, made of oak with delicate traceries of ebony and brass.

====Secession in Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia====
The most notable Secession buildings in &quot;Prague&quot; are examples of total art with distinctive architecture, sculpture and paintings. The main railway station (1901–1909) was designed by Josef Fanta and features paintings of Václav Jansa and sculptures of Ladislav Šaloun and Stanislav Sucharda along with other artists. The Municipal House (1904–1912) was designed by Osvald Polívka and Antonín Balšánek, painted by famous Czech painter Alphonse Mucha and features sculptures of Josef Mařatka and Ladislav Šaloun. Polívka, Mařatka, and Šaloun simultaneously cooperated in the construction of New City Hall (1908–1911) along with Stanislav Sucharda, and Mucha later painted St. Vitus Cathedral&#x27;s stained glass windows in his distinctive style.

The most important Czech architect of this period was Jan Kotěra, who studied in Vienna under Otto Wagner. His best-known works are the Peterka House at 12 Wenceslas Square in Prague (1899–1900), the National House in Prostějov (1905–1907) and the Museum of Eastern Bohemia in Hradec Králové (1909–1912). Many important Vienesse architects were born in Moravia or Austrian Silesia, like Josef Hoffmann, Hubert Gessner, Joseph Maria Olbrich and Leopold Bauer.

The style of combining Hungarian Szecesszió and national architectural elements was typical for a Slovak architect Dušan Jurkovič. His most original works are the Cultural House in Szakolca (now Skalica in Slovakia, 1905), the buildings of spa in Luhačovice (now Czech Republic) in 1901–1903 and 35 war cemeteries near Nowy Żmigród in Galicia (now Poland), most of them heavily influenced by local Lemko (Rusyn) folk art and carpentry (1915–1917).

====Secession in Galicia====

The most important centres of Secession in Galicia were Kraków, Lviv and Bielsko-Biała. The most important example of the style in Kraków is the Palace of Art (1898–1901), designed by Franciszek Mączyński under the influence of the Secession Hall in Vienna. Other important works Mączyński designed in Kraków together with Tadeusz Stryjeński: the House Under the Globe (1904–1905) and the Old Theater (1903–1906). The most important interior designers were Stanisław Wyspiański and Józef Mehoffer, who designed many stained glass windows and building interiors. The most important work of the former are the stained glasses in the Franciscan Church and in the House of the Krakow Medical Society (1905) and of the latter in the interior of the House Under the Globe.

In Lviv the most important architect was Władysław Sadłowski, who studied in Vienna and was influenced by Otto Wagner. He designed the Lviv railway station (1899–1904), the Lviv&#x27;s Philharmonic (1905–1908), and the Industrial School (1907–1908). Other important architected, also inspired by Wagner, was Ivan Levynskyi.

One of the most famous buildings in Bielsko-Biała is the so-called Frog House by Emanuel Rost (1903). Other important examples of Secession were designed by Vienesse architects: Max Fabiani, the author of the house at 1 Barlickiego Street (1900) as well as Leopold Bauer, who designed the house at 51 Stojałowskiego Street (1903) and the rebuilding of the Saint Nicholas&#x27; Cathedral (1909–10).

====Secession in Slovenia, Bosnia, Croatia and Trieste====
The most prolific &quot;Slovenian&quot; Secession architect was Ciril Metod Koch. He studied at Otto Wagner&#x27;s classes in Vienna and worked in the Laybach (now Ljubljana, Slovenia) City Council from 1894 to 1923. After the earthquake in Laybach in 1895, he designed many secular buildings in Secession style that he adopted from 1900 to 1910: Pogačnik House (1901), Čuden Building (1901), The Farmers Loan Bank (1906–07), renovated Hauptmann Building in Secession style in 1904. The highlight of his career was the Loan Bank in Radmannsdorf (now Radovljica) in 1906.

Other important Slovene architect, who was active also in Bosnia, was Josip Vancaš, the authot of such works like Grand Hotel Union (1902–1903) or City Savings Bank in Ljubljana (1902–1903) as well as the Ješua D. Salom Mansion (1901) and the Central Post Office in Sarajevo (1907–1913). Also Jože Plečnik and Max Fabiani, both important Vienna Secession architects, were born in Slovenia. The latter designed some buildings in Slovenia and Trieste, like the Bartoli House in Trieste (1906).

In Croatia, the most important examples of Secession include the Kallina House in Zagreb by Vjekoslav Bastl (1903–1904) and the Croatian State Archives in Zagreb by Rudolf Lubinski (1911–1913).

===Arta 1900 or Art Nouveau in Romania===
Art Nouveau appeared in Romania during the same years as in Western Europe (early 1890s until the outbreak of World War I in 1914), but here few of the buildings are in this style, the Beaux-Arts style being predominant. The most famous is the Constanța Casino. Most of the Romanian examples of Art Nouveau architecture are actually mixes of Beaux Arts and Art Nouveau, like the Romulus Porescu House or house no. 61 on Strada Vasile Lascăr, both in Bucharest. This is similar to what was happening in France, where eclecticism was more popular, pure Art Nouveau buildings and structures being relatively rare. Despite most houses from the reign of Carol I being Beaux-Arts, some of them have Art Nouveau stoves inside, since the style of the exterior did not always dictate that of the stove or the entire interior.

One of the most notable Art Nouveau painters from Romania was Ștefan Luchian, who quickly took over the innovative and decorative directions of Art Nouveau for a short period of time. This period coincided with the founding of the Ileana Society in 1897, of which he was a founding member, a society that organized an exhibition at the Union Hotel titled &quot;The Exhibition of Independent Artists&quot; (1898) and published the &quot;Ileana Magazine&quot;.

Transylvania has examples of both Art Nouveau and Romanian Revival buildings, the former being from the Austro-Hungarian era. Most of them can be found in Oradea, nicknamed the &quot;Art Nouveau capital of Romania&quot;, but also in Timișoara, Târgu Mureș and Sibiu.

===&quot;Stile Liberty&quot; in Italy===

Art Nouveau in Italy was known as , , and especially . Liberty style took its name from Arthur Lasenby Liberty and the store he founded in 1874 in London, Liberty department store, which specialised in importing ornaments, textiles and art objects from Japan and the Far East, and whose colourful textiles which were particularly popular in Italy. Notable Italian designers in the style included Galileo Chini, whose ceramics were often inspired both by majolica patterns. He was later known as a painter and a theatrical scenery designer; he designed the sets for two celebrated Puccini operas &quot;Gianni Schicchi&quot; and &quot;Turandot&quot;.

Liberty style architecture varied greatly, and often followed historical styles, particularly the Baroque. Façades were often drenched with decoration and sculpture. Examples of the Liberty style include the Villino Florio (1899–1902) by Ernesto Basile in Palermo; the Palazzo Castiglioni in Milan by Giuseppe Sommaruga (1901–1903); Milan, and the Casa Guazzoni (1904–05) in Milan by Giovanni Battista Bossi (1904–06).

Colorful frescoes, painted or in ceramics, and sculpture, both in the interior and exterior, were a popular feature of Liberty style. They drew upon both classical and floral themes. as in the baths of Acque della Salute, and in the Casa Guazzoni in Milan.

The most important figure in Liberty style design was Carlo Bugatti, the son of an architect and decorator, father of Rembrandt Bugatti, Liberty sculptor, and of Ettore Bugatti, famous automobile designer. He studied at the Milanese Academy of Brera, and later the in Paris. His work was distinguished by its exoticism and eccentricity, included silverware, textiles, ceramics, and musical instruments, but he is best remembered for his innovative furniture designs, shown first in the 1888 Milan Fine Arts Fair. His furniture often featured a keyhole design, and had unusual coverings, including parchment and silk, and inlays of bone and ivory. It also sometimes had surprising organic shapes, copied after snails and cobras.

===Art Nouveau and Secession in Serbia===

Due to the close proximity to Austria–Hungary and Vojvodina being part of the empire until 1918, both the Vienna Secession and Hungarian Szecesszió were prevalent movements in what is today&#x27;s northern Serbia, as well as the Capital of Belgrade. Famous Austrian and Hungarian architects would design many buildings in Subotica, Novi Sad, Palić, Zrenjanin, Vrbas, Senta, and Kikinda. Art Nouveau heritage in Belgrade, Pančevo, Aranđelovac, and Vrnjačka Banja are a mixture of French, German, Austrian, Hungarian, and local Serbian movements. From the curvy floral beauty of the Subotica&#x27;s Synagogue to the Morava-style inspired rosettes on Belgrade&#x27;s telegraph building, Art Nouveau architecture takes various shapes in present-day Serbia.

In the early 1900s, north of the Sava and the Danube, resurgent Hungarian national sentiment infused the buildings in Subotica and Senta with local floral ethnic motifs, while in the tiny Kingdom of Serbia, national romantics like Branko Tanezević and Dragutin Inkiostiri-Medenjak (both born in the Austro-Hungarian Empire), translated Serbia&#x27;s traditional motifs into marvellous buildings. Other architects, like Milan Antonović and Nikola Nestorović brought the then-fashionable sinuous lines and natural motifs to the homes and businesses of their wealthy patrons, so they could show off their worldliness and keeping up with the trends in Paris, Munich and Vienna.

===&quot;Modernismo&quot; and &quot;Modernisme&quot; in Spain===

A highly original variant of the style emerged in Barcelona, Catalonia, at about the same time that the Art Nouveau style appeared in Belgium and France. It was called in Catalan and &quot;Modernismo&quot; in Spanish. Its most famous creator was Antoni Gaudí. Gaudí used floral and organic forms in a very novel way in &quot;Palau Güell&quot; (1886–1890). According to UNESCO, &quot;the architecture of the park combined elements from the Arts and Crafts movement, Symbolism, Expressionism, and Rationalism, and presaged and influenced many forms and techniques of 20th-century Modernism.&quot;
He integrated crafts as ceramics, stained glass, wrought ironwork forging and carpentry into his architecture. In his Güell Pavilions (1884–1887) and then Parc Güell (1900–1914) he also used a new technique called &quot;trencadís&quot;, which used waste ceramic pieces. His designs from about 1903, the &quot;Casa Batlló&quot; (1904–1906) and &quot;Casa Milà&quot; (1906–1912), are most closely related to the stylistic elements of Art Nouveau. Later structures such as &quot;Sagrada Família&quot; combined Art Nouveau elements with revivalist Neo-Gothic. Casa Batlló, Casa Milà, Güell Pavilions, and Parc Güell were results of his collaboration with Josep Maria Jujol, who himself created houses in Sant Joan Despí (1913–1926), several churches near Tarragona (1918 and 1926) and the sinuous Casa Planells (1924) in Barcelona.

Besides the dominating presence of Gaudí, Lluís Domènech i Montaner also used Art Nouveau in Barcelona in buildings such as the Castell dels Tres Dragons (1888), Casa Lleó Morera, Palau de la Música Catalana (1905) and Hospital de Sant Pau (1901–1930). The two latter buildings have been listed by UNESCO as World Cultural Heritage.

Another major modernista was Josep Puig i Cadafalch, who designed the Casa Martí and its café, the Casimir Casaramona textile factory (now the CaixaFòrum art museum), Casa Macaya, Casa Amatller, the Palau del Baró de Quadras (housing Casa Àsia for 10 years until 2013) and the (&#x27;House of Spikes&#x27;).

A distinctive Art Nouveau movement was also in the Valencian Community. Some of the notable architects were Demetrio Ribes Marco, Vicente Pascual Pastor, Timoteo Briet Montaud, and José María Manuel Cortina Pérez. Valencian Art Nouveau defining characteristics are a notable use of ceramics in decoration, both in the façade and in ornamentation, and also the use of Valencian regional motives.

Another remarkable variant is the Madrilenian Art Nouveau or , with such notable buildings as the Longoria Palace, the Casino de Madrid or the Cementerio de la Almudena, among others. Renowned modernistas from Madrid were architects José López Sallaberry, Fernando Arbós y Tremanti and .


The movement left a wide art heritage including drawings, paintings, sculptures, glass and metal work, mosaics, ceramics, and furniture. A part of it can be found in Museu Nacional d&#x27;Art de Catalunya.

Inspired by a Paris café called Le Chat Noir, where he had previously worked, decided to open a café in Barcelona that was named (Four Cats in Catalan). The café became a central meeting point for Barcelona&#x27;s most prominent figures of &quot;Modernisme&quot;, such as Pablo Picasso and Ramon Casas i Carbó who helped to promote the movement by his posters and postcards. For the café he created a picture called Ramon Casas and Pere Romeu on a Tandem that was replaced with his another composition entitled Ramon Casas and Pere Romeu in an Automobile in 1901, symbolizing the new century.

Antoni Gaudí designed furniture for many of the houses he built; one example is an armchair called the for the Battle House. He influenced another notable Catalan furniture designer, (1870–1953) who often combined marquetry and mosaics with his furnishings.

===&quot;Arte Nova&quot; in Portugal===
The Art Nouveau variant in Aveiro (Portugal) was called &quot;Arte Nova&quot;, and its principal characteristic feature was ostentation: the style was used by bourgeoisie who wanted to express their wealth on the façades while leaving the interiors conservative. Another distinctive feature of Arte Nova was the use of locally produced tiles with Art Nouveau motifs.

The most influential artist of Arte Nova was Francisco Augusto da Silva Rocha. Though he was not trained as an architect, he designed many buildings in Aveiro and in other cities in Portugal. One of them, the Major Pessoa residence, has both an Art Nouveau façade and interior, and now hosts the Museum of Arte Nova.

There are other examples of Arte Nova in other cities of Portugal. Some of them are the Museum-Residence Dr. Anastácio Gonçalves by (1904–1905) in Lisbon, Café Majestic by (1921) and Livraria Lello bookstore by (1906), both in Porto.

===&quot;Jugendstil&quot; in the Nordic countries===
====Finland====
Art Nouveau was popular in the Nordic countries, where it was usually known as Jugendstil, and was often combined with the National Romantic Style of each country. The Nordic country with the largest number of Jugendstil buildings is the Grand Duchy of Finland, then a part of Russian Empire. The Jugendstil period coincided with Golden Age of Finnish Art and national awakening. After Paris Exposition in 1900 the leading Finnish artist was Akseli Gallen-Kallela. He is known for his illustrations of the Kalevala, the Finnish national epic, as well as for painting numerous Judendstil buildings in the Duchy.

The architects of the Finnish pavilion at the Exposition were Herman Gesellius, Armas Lindgren, and Eliel Saarinen. They worked together from 1896 to 1905 and created many notable buildings in Helsinki including Pohjola Insurance building (1899–1901) and National Museum of Finland (1905–1910) as well as their joint residence Hvitträsk in Kirkkonummi (1902). Architects were inspired by Nordic legends and nature, rough granite façade thus became a symbol for belonging to the Finnish nation. After the firm dissolved, Saarinen designed the Helsinki Railway Station (1905–1914) in clearer forms, influenced by American architecture. The sculptor who worked with Saarinen in construction of National Museum of Finland and Helsinki Railway Station was Emil Wikström.

Another architect who created several notable works in Finland was Lars Sonck. His major Jugendstil works include Tampere Cathedral (1902–1907), Ainola, the home of Jean Sibelius (1903), Headquarters of the Helsinki Telephone Association (1903–1907) and Kallio Church in Helsinki (1908–1912). Also, Magnus Schjerfbeck, brother of Helene Schjerfbeck, made tuberculosis sanatorium known as Nummela Sanatorium in 1903 using the Jugendstil style.

====Norway====
Norway also was aspiring independence (from Sweden) and local Art Nouveau was connected with a revival inspired by Viking folk art and crafts. Notable designers included Lars Kisarvik, who designed chairs with traditional Viking and Celtic patterns, and Gerhard Munthe, who designed a chair with a stylised dragon-head emblem from ancient Viking ships, as well as a wide variety of posters, paintings and graphics.

The Norwegian town of Ålesund is regarded as the main centre of Art Nouveau in Scandinavia because it was completely reconstructed after a fire of 23 January 1904. About 350 buildings were built between 1904 and 1907 under an urban plan designed by the engineer Frederik Næsser. The merger of unity and variety gave birth to a style known as Ål Stil. Buildings of the style have linear decor and echoes of both Jugendstil and vernacular elements, e.g. towers of stave churches or the crested roofs. One of the buildings, Swan Pharmacy, now hosts the Art Nouveau Centre.

====Sweden and Denmark====
Jugendstil masterpieces of other Nordic countries include Engelbrektskyrkan (1914) and Royal Dramatic Theatre (1901–1908) in Stockholm, Sweden and former City Library (now Danish National Business Archives) in Aarhus, Denmark (1898–1901). The architect of the latter is Hack Kampmann, then a proponent of National Romantic Style who also created Custom House, Theatre and Villa Kampen in Aarhus. Denmark&#x27;s most notable Art Nouveau designer was the silversmith Georg Jensen. The Baltic Exhibition in Malmö 1914 can be seen as the last major manifestation of the Jugendstil in Sweden.

===&quot;Modern&quot; in Russia===

 (&#x27;Modern&#x27;) was a very colourful Russian variation of Art Nouveau which appeared in Moscow and Saint Petersburg in 1898 with the publication of a new art journal, (&quot;Mir Iskusstva&quot;, &#x27;The World of Art&#x27;), by Russian artists Alexandre Benois and Léon Bakst, and chief editor Sergei Diaghilev. The magazine organized exhibitions of leading Russian artists, including Mikhail Vrubel, Konstantin Somov, Isaac Levitan, and the book illustrator Ivan Bilibin. The World of Art style made less use of the vegetal and floral forms of French Art Nouveau; it drew heavily upon the bright colours and exotic designs of Russian folklore and fairy tales. The most influential contribution of the &quot;Mir Iskusstva&quot; was the creation of a new ballet company, the , headed by Diaghilev, with costumes and sets designed by Bakst and Benois. The new ballet company premiered in Paris in 1909, and performed there every year through 1913. The exotic and colourful sets designed by Benois and Bakst had a major impact on French art and design. The costume and set designs were reproduced in the leading Paris magazines, , and , and the Russian style became known in Paris as . The company was stranded in Paris first by the outbreak of World War I, and then by the Russian Revolution in 1917, and ironically never performed in Russia.

Of Russian architects, the most prominent in the pure Art Nouveau style was Fyodor Schechtel. The most famous example is the Ryabushinsky House in Moscow. It was built by a Russian businessman and newspaper owner, and then, after the Russian Revolution, became the residence of the writer Maxim Gorky, and is now the Gorky Museum. Its main staircase, made of a polished aggregate of concrete, marble and granite, has flowing, curling lines like the waves of the sea, and is illuminated by a lamp in the form of a floating jellyfish. The interior also features doors, windows and ceiling decorated with colorful frescoes of mosaic. Schechtel, who is also considered a major figure in Russian symbolism, designed several other landmark buildings in Moscow, including the rebuilding of the Moscow Yaroslavsky railway station, in a more traditional Moscow revival style.

Other Russian architects of the period created Russian Revival architecture, which drew from historic Russian architecture. These buildings were created mostly in wood, and referred to the Architecture of Kievan Rus&#x27;. One example is the Teremok House in Talashkino (1901–1902) by Sergey Malyutin, and Pertsova House (also known as Pertsov House) in Moscow (1905–1907). He also was a member of Mir iskusstva movement. The Saint Petersburg architect Nikolai Vasilyev built in a range of styles before emigrating in 1923. This building is most notable for stone carvings made by Sergei Vashkov inspired by the carvings of Cathedral of Saint Demetrius in Vladimir and Saint George Cathedral in Yuryev-Polsky of the 12th and 13th centuries. Another example of this Russian Revival architecture is the Marfo-Mariinsky Convent (1908–1912), an updated Russian Orthodox Church by Alexey Shchusev, who later, ironically, designed Lenin&#x27;s Mausoleum in Moscow.

Several art colonies in Russia in this period were built in the Russian Revival style. The two best-known colonies were Abramtsevo, funded by Savva Mamontov, and Talashkino, Smolensk Governorate, funded by Princess Maria Tenisheva.

===Ukrainian &quot;Modern&quot; architecture===

Early 20th-century architecture in Ukrainian lands (southwestern part of the Russian Empire, Eastern Galicia, Bukovina and Transcarpathia in Austria-Hungary) developed under the influence of Ukrainian folk architecture, as well as trends of European Art Nouveau, such as Zakopane Style. Ukrainian &quot;modern&quot; architecture first came to prominence in Poltava Governorate, where its most active promoters were Vasyl Krychevskyi and Opanas Slastion. In the late 1900s and early 1910s, a number of buildings in what was then known simply as &quot;Ukrainian style&quot; were constructed in Kyiv, Kharkiv, Odesa, Katerynoslav and a number of other places in the Russian Empire. In Western Ukraine, which was at that time part of Austria-Hungary, the local Ukrainian style was influenced by Hutsul architecture, as well as Western European trends and influences from Great Ukraine.

===&quot;Jūgendstils&quot; (Art Nouveau in Riga)===

Riga, the present-day capital of Latvia, was at the time one of the major cities of the Russian Empire. Art Nouveau architecture in Riga nevertheless developed according to its own dynamics, and the style became overwhelmingly popular in the city. Soon after the Latvian Ethnographic Exhibition in 1896 and the Industrial and Handicrafts Exhibition in 1901, Art Nouveau became the dominant style in the city. Thus Art Nouveau architecture accounts for one-third of all the buildings in the centre of Riga, making it the city with the highest concentration of such buildings anywhere in the world. The quantity and quality of Art Nouveau architecture was among the criteria for including Riga in UNESCO World Cultural Heritage.

There were different variations of Art Nouveau architecture in Riga:
* in Eclectic Art Nouveau, floral and other nature-inspired elements of decoration were most popular. Examples of that variation are works of Mikhail Eisenstein,
* in Perpendicular Art Nouveau, geometrical ornaments were integrated into the vertical compositions of the façades. Several department stores were built in this style, and it is sometimes also referred to as &quot;department store style&quot; or in German,
* National Romantic Art Nouveau was inspired by local folk art, monumental volumes and the use of natural building materials.
Some later Neo-Classical buildings also contained Art Nouveau details.

===&quot;Style Sapin&quot; in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland===

A variation called (&#x27;Fir-tree Style&#x27;) emerged in La Chaux-de-Fonds in the Canton of Neuchâtel in Switzerland. The style was launched by the painter and artist Charles l’Eplattenier and was inspired especially by the , &#x27;fir tree&#x27;, and other plants and wildlife of the Jura Mountains. One of his major works was the crematorium in the town, which featured triangular tree forms, pine cones, and other natural themes from the region. The style also blended in the more geometric stylistic elements of Jugendstil and Vienna Secession.

Another notable building in the style is the Villa Fallet La Chaux-de-Fonds, a chalet designed and built in 1905 by a student of L&#x27;Epplattenier, the eighteen-year-old Le Corbusier. The form of the house was a traditional Swiss chalet, but the decoration of the façade included triangular trees and other natural features. Le Corbusier built two more chalets in the area, including the Villa Stotzer, in a more traditional chalet style.

===&quot;Tiffany Style&quot; and Louis Sullivan in the United States===
In the United States, the firm of Louis Comfort Tiffany played a central role in American Art Nouveau. Born in 1848, he studied at the National Academy of Design in New York City, began working with glass at the age of 24, entered the family business started by his father, and in 1885 set up his own enterprise devoted to fine glass, and developed new techniques for its colouring. In 1893, he began making glass vases and bowls, again developing new techniques that allowed more original shapes and colouring, and began experimenting with decorative window glass. Layers of glass were printed, marbled and superimposed, giving an exceptional richness and variety of colour in 1895 his new works were featured in the Art Nouveau gallery of Siegfried Bing, giving him a new European clientele. After the death of his father in 1902, he took over the entire Tiffany enterprise, but still devoted much of his time to designing and manufacturing glass art objects. At the urging of Thomas Edison, he began to manufacture electric lamps with multicoloured glass shades in structures of bronze and iron, or decorated with mosaics, produced in numerous series and editions, each made with the care of a piece of jewellery. A team of designers and craftsmen worked on each product. The Tiffany lamp in particular became one of the icons of the Art Nouveau, but Tiffany&#x27;s craftsmen designed and made extraordinary windows, vases, and other glass art. Tiffany&#x27;s glass also had great success at the &quot;1900 Exposition Universelle&quot; in Paris; his stained glass window called the &quot;Flight of Souls&quot; won a gold medal. The Columbian Exposition was an important venue for Tiffany; a chapel he designed was shown at the Pavilion of Art and Industry. The Tiffany Chapel, along with one of the windows of Tiffany&#x27;s home in New York, are now on display at the Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art in Winter Park, Florida.

Another important figure in American Art Nouveau was the architect Louis Sullivan. Sullivan was a leading pioneer of American modern architecture. He was the founder of the Chicago School, the architect of some of the first skyscrapers, and the teacher of Frank Lloyd Wright. His most famous saying was &quot;Form follows function.&quot; While the form of his buildings was shaped by their function, his decoration was an example of American Art Nouveau. At the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, most famous for the neoclassical architecture of its renowned &quot;White City&quot;, he designed a spectacular Art Nouveau entrance for the very functional Transportation Building.

While the architecture of his &quot;Carson, Pirie, Scott and Company Building&quot; (1899) (now the Sullivan Center) was strikingly modern and functional, he surrounded the windows with stylised floral decoration. He invented equally original decoration for the National Farmer&#x27;s Bank of Owatonna, Minnestota (1907–1908) and the Merchants&#x27; National Bank in Grinell, Iowa. He invented a specifically American variety of Art Nouveau, declaring that decorative forms should oscillate, surge, mix and derive without end. He created works of great precision which sometimes combined Gothic with Art Nouveau themes.

Also worth noting are the &quot;Uhl brothers&quot; from Toledo, Ohio, who set new standards in metal furniture production with their designs for the &quot;Toledo Metal Furniture Co.&quot;

===Art Nouveau in Argentina===
Flooded with European immigrants, Argentina welcomed all artistic and architectural European styles, including Art Nouveau. There was an environment of huge investments and flexible rules for construction, which encouraged young architects from Europe to come and grow their portfolio to later go back to Europe. As a result of this, Argentina became the country outside of Europe with most art nouveau buildings. Cities with the most notable Art Nouveau heritage in Argentina are Buenos Aires, Rosario and Mar del Plata.

Paris was a prototype for Buenos Aires with the construction of large boulevards and avenues in the 19th century. The local style along with French influence was also following Italian Liberty as many architects (Virginio Colombo, Francisco Gianotti, Mario Palanti) were Italians. In works of Catalan influence can be noted as he completed his studies in Barcelona in 1900 as well as in the work of Eduardo Rodríguez Ortega. The influence of Vienna Secession can be found at Paso y Viamonte building, Club Español, Regimiento de Granaderos a Caballo and the Savoy hotel.

Some local features are the adaptation to the previously existent &quot;chorizo house&quot; format of buildings, which implied a relatively narrow façade for an actually deep building inside of the block, with multiple patios or holes for air and light; as well as the characteristic &quot;cut corners&quot; on every block that was a requirement by law in Buenos Aires since the end of the 1800s; material availability was also different than in Europe, and buildings will often be covered of a &quot;simil piedra París&quot; which was an imitation of the Parisian stone made by mixing cement with sand and different minerals.

The introduction of Art Nouveau in Rosario is connected to who trained in Barcelona. His (1912) features one of the largest stained glass windows in Latin America produced (as well as tiling and ceramics) by the local firm Buxadera, Fornells y Cía. The sculptor of the building is Diego Masana from Barcelona.

Belgian influence on Argentinian Art Nouveau is represented by the Villa Ortiz Basualdo, now hosting the Juan Carlos Castagnino Municipal Museum of Art in Mar del Plata where the furniture, interiors, and lighting are by Gustave Serrurier-Bovy.

===Art Nouveau in the rest of the world===
As in Argentina, Art Nouveau in other countries was mostly influenced by foreign artists:
* Spaniards were behind Art Nouveau projects in Havana, Cuba, they were even not qualified enough to be called architects. Spaniards were not directly involved in works in Ponce, Puerto Rico but were an inspiration and a subject of study for local architects in the development of local styles such as Ponce Creole,
* French were behind Art Nouveau in Tunisia (that was a French protectorate then),
* Germans were behind Jugendstil heritage of Lüderitz, Namibia; Qingdao, China,
* Italians were behind Art Nouveau in Valparaíso, Chile; Montevideo, Uruguay; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil,
* Russians were behind Art Nouveau heritage of Harbin, China,
* Art Nouveau Heritage in Lima consists of work of Italians Masperi brothers, French architect Claude Sahut and British masters of stained glass
* Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City was a result of the cooperation of Italians (architect Adamo Boari and sculptor Leonardo Bistolfi), local architect , Hungarian artists Aladár Körösfői-Kriesch, Géza Maróti and Miksa Róth, Catalan sculptor Agustí Querol Subirats and French master Edgar Brandt.

Art Nouveau motifs can also be found in French Colonial artchitechture throughout French Indochina.

A notable art movement called Bezalel school appeared in the Palestine region in dating to the late Ottoman and British Mandate periods. It has been described as &quot;a fusion of oriental art and Jugendstil.&quot; Several artists associated with the Bezalel school were noted for their Art Nouveau style, including Ze&#x27;ev Raban, Ephraim Moses Lilien and Abel Pann.

==Characteristics, decoration and motifs==
Early Art Nouveau, particularly in Belgium and France, was characterized by undulating, curving forms inspired by lilies, vines, flower stems and other natural forms, used in particular in the interiors of Victor Horta and the decoration of Louis Majorelle and Émile Gallé. It also drew upon patterns based on butterflies and dragonflies, borrowed from Japanese art, which were popular in Europe at the time.

Early Art Nouveau also often featured more stylised forms expressing movement, such as the &quot;coup de fouet&quot; or &quot;whiplash&quot; line, depicted in the cyclamen plants drawn by designer Hermann Obrist in 1894. A description published in &quot;Pan&quot; magazine of Hermann Obrist&#x27;s wall hanging &quot;Cyclamen&quot; (1894), compared it to the &quot;sudden violent curves generated by the crack of a whip,&quot; The term &quot;whiplash&quot;, though it was originally used to ridicule the style, is frequently applied to the characteristic curves employed by Art Nouveau artists. Such decorative undulating and flowing lines in a syncopated rhythm and asymmetrical shape, are often found in the architecture, painting, sculpture, and other forms of Art Nouveau design.

Other floral forms were popular, inspired by lilies, wisteria and other flowers, particularly in the lamps of Louis Comfort Tiffany and the glass objects made by the artists of the School of Nancy and Émile Gallé. Other curving and undulating forms borrowed from nature included butterflies, peacocks, swans, and water lilies. Many designs depicted women&#x27;s hair intertwined with stems of lilies, irises and other flowers. Stylised floral forms were particularly used by Victor Horta in carpets, balustrades, windows, and furniture. They were also used extensively by Hector Guimard for balustrades, and, most famously, for the lamps and railings at the entrances of the Paris Metro. Guimard explained: &quot;That which must be avoided in everything that is continuous is the parallel and symmetry. Nature is the greatest builder and nature makes nothing that is parallel and nothing that is symmetrical.&quot;

Earlier Art Nouveau furniture, such as that made by Louis Majorelle and Henry van de Velde, was characterized by the use of exotic and expensive materials, including mahogany with inlays of precious woods and trim, and curving forms without right angles. It gave a sensation of lightness.

In the second phase of Art Nouveau, following 1900, the decoration became purer and the lines were more stylised. The curving lines and forms evolved into polygons and then into cubes and other geometric forms. These geometric forms were used with particular effect in the architecture and furniture of Joseph Maria Olbrich, Otto Wagner, Koloman Moser and Josef Hoffmann, especially the Stoclet Palace in Brussels, which announced the arrival of Art Deco and modernism.

Another characteristic of Art Nouveau architecture was the use of light, by opening up of interior spaces, by the removal of walls, and the extensive use of skylights to bring a maximum amount of light into the interior. Victor Horta&#x27;s residence-studio and other houses built by him had extensive skylights, supported on curving iron frames. In the Hotel Tassel he removed the traditional walls around the stairway, so that the stairs became a central element of the interior design.

==Relationship with contemporary styles and movements==
As an art style, Art Nouveau has affinities with the Pre-Raphaelites and the Symbolist styles, and artists like Aubrey Beardsley, Alphonse Mucha, Edward Burne-Jones, Gustav Klimt and Jan Toorop could be classed in more than one of these styles. Unlike Symbolist painting, however, Art Nouveau has a distinctive appearance; and, unlike the artisan-oriented Arts and Crafts movement, Art Nouveau artists readily used new materials, machined surfaces, and abstraction in the service of pure design.

Art Nouveau did not eschew the use of machines, as the Arts and Crafts movement did. For sculpture, the principal materials employed were glass and wrought iron, resulting in sculptural qualities even in architecture. Ceramics were also employed in creating editions of sculptures by artists such as Auguste Rodin. though his sculpture is not considered Art Nouveau.

Art Nouveau architecture made use of many technological innovations of the late 19th century, especially the use of exposed iron and large, irregularly shaped pieces of glass for architecture.

Art Nouveau tendencies were also absorbed into local styles. In Denmark, for example, it was one aspect of (&#x27;Aesthetic work&#x27;), which itself more closely relates to the Arts and Crafts style. Likewise, artists adopted many of the floral and organic motifs of Art Nouveau into the (&#x27;Young Poland&#x27;) style in Poland. , however, was also inclusive of other artistic styles and encompassed a broader approach to art, literature, and lifestyle.

Architecturally, Art Nouveau has affinities with styles that, although modern, exist outside the modernist tradition established by architects like Walter Gropius and Le Corbusier. It is particularly closely related to Expressionist architecture, which shares its preference for organic shapes, but grew out of an intellectual dissatisfaction with Art Nouveau&#x27;s approach to ornamentation. As opposed to Art Nouveau&#x27;s focus on plants and vegetal motifs, Expressionism takes inspiration from things like caves, mountains, lightning, crystal, and rock formations. Another style conceived as a reaction to Art Nouveau was Art Deco, which rejected organic surfaces altogether in preference for a rectilinear style derived from the contemporary artistic avant-garde.

==Genres==
Art Nouveau is represented in painting and sculpture, but it is most prominent in architecture and the decorative arts. It was well-suited to the graphic arts, especially the poster, interior design, metal and glass art, jewellery, furniture design, ceramics and textiles.

===Posters and graphic art===

The graphic arts flourished in the Art Nouveau period, thanks to new technologies of printing, particularly colour lithography, which allowed the mass production of colour posters. Art was no longer confined to galleries, museums and salons; it could be found on Paris walls, and in illustrated art magazines, which circulated throughout Europe and to the United States. The most popular theme of Art Nouveau posters was women; women symbolizing glamour, modernity and beauty, often surrounded by flowers.

In Britain, the leading graphic artist in the Art Nouveau style was Aubrey Beardsley (1872–1898). He began with engraved book illustrations for &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;, then black and white illustrations for &quot;Salome&quot; by Oscar Wilde (1893), which brought him fame. In the same year, he began engraving illustrations and posters for the art magazine &quot;The Studio&quot;, which helped publicize European artists such as Fernand Khnopff in Britain. The curving lines and intricate floral patterns attracted as much attention as the text.

The Swiss-French artist Eugène Grasset (1845–1917) was one of the first creators of French Art Nouveau posters. He helped decorate the famous cabaret Le Chat noir in 1885 and made his first posters for the &quot;Fêtes de Paris&quot;. He made a celebrated poster of Sarah Bernhardt in 1890, and a wide variety of book illustrations. The artist-designers Jules Chéret, Georges de Feure and the painter Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec all made posters for Paris theaters, cafés, dance halls cabarets. The Czech artist Alphonse Mucha (1860–1939) arrived in Paris in 1888, and in 1895 made a poster for actress Sarah Bernhardt in the play &quot;Gismonda&quot; by Victorien Sardou. The success of this poster led to a contract to produce posters for six more plays by Bernhardt. Over the next four years, he also designed sets, costumes, and even jewellery for the actress. Based on the success of his theater posters, Mucha made posters for a variety of products, ranging from cigarettes and soap to beer biscuits, all featuring an idealized female figure with an hourglass figure. He went on to design products, from jewellery to biscuit boxes, in his distinctive style.

In Vienna, the most prolific designer of graphics and posters was Koloman Moser (1868–1918), who actively participated in the Secession movement with Gustav Klimt and Josef Hoffmann, and made illustrations and covers for the magazine of the movement, &quot;Ver Sacrum&quot;, as well as paintings, furniture and decoration.

===Painting===
Painting was another domain of Art Nouveau, though most painters associated with Art Nouveau are primarily described as members of other movements, particularly Post-Impressionism and symbolism. Alphonse Mucha was famous for his Art Nouveau posters, which frustrated him. According to his son and biographer, Jiří Mucha, he did not think much of Art Nouveau. &quot;What is it, &quot;Art Nouveau&quot;? he asked. &quot;... Art can never be new.&quot; He took the greatest pride in his work as a history painter. His Art Nouveau-inspired painting &quot;Slava&quot; is a portrait of the daughter of his patron in Slavic costume, which was modelled after his theatrical posters.

The painters most closely associated with Art Nouveau were Les Nabis, post-impressionist artists who were active in Paris from 1888 until 1900. One of their stated goals was to break down the barrier between the fine arts and the decorative arts. They painted not only canvases, but also decorative screens and panels. Many of their works were influenced by the aesthetics of Japanese prints. The members included Pierre Bonnard, Maurice Denis, Paul Ranson, Édouard Vuillard, Ker-Xavier Roussel, Félix Vallotton, and Paul Sérusier.

The Austrian painter Gustav Klimt was an exponent of Art Nouveau painting, and more specifically a representative of the Modernist movement of the Viennese Secession. Klimt painted canvases and murals in an ornate personal style, which he also expressed through handicrafts, such as those found in the Viennese Secession Gallery. Klimt found one of his most recurring sources of inspiration in the female nude. His works are sensual, with a naturalistic, individual, organic style, inspired by nature following the decorative style of Gaudí.
The Catalan modernist painters (Ramón Casas, Santiago Rusiñol, Aleix Clapés, Joaquim Sunyer, Hermenegildo Anglada Camarasa, Juan Brull, Ricard Canals, Javier Gosé, Josep Maria Sert, Miguel Utrillo, etc.), closely connected with the avant-garde in Paris, and hugely influenced by Antoni Gaudí, had in the Els Quatre Gats tavern their meeting place. Pablo Picasso came out of the group.

Disciples of Anglada Camarasa were the Argentines Gregorio López Naguil, Tito Cittadini and Raúl Mazza who were responsible for carrying art nouveau painting to South America

In Belgium, Fernand Khnopff worked in both painting and graphic design. Wall murals by Gustav Klimt were integrated into decorative scheme of Josef Hoffmann for the Stoclet Palace (1905–1911). The Klimt mural for the dining room at the Stoclet Palace is considered a masterpiece of late Art Nouveau.

One subject did appear both in traditional painting and Art Nouveau; the American dancer Loie Fuller, was portrayed by French and Austrian painters and poster artists.

One particular style that became popular in the Art Nouveau period, especially in Brussels, was sgraffito, a technique invented in the Renaissance of applying layers of tinted plaster to make murals on the façades of houses. This was used in particular by Belgian architect Paul Hankar for the houses he built for two artist friends, Paul Cauchie and Albert Ciamberlani.

===Glass art===

Glass art was a medium in which Art Nouveau found new and varied ways of expression. Intense amount of experimentation went on, particularly in France, to find new effects of transparency and opacity: in engraving win cameo, double layers, and acid engraving, a technique that permitted production in series. The city of Nancy became an important centre for the French glass industry, and the workshops of Émile Gallé and the Daum studio, led by Auguste and Antonin Daum, were located there. They worked with many notable designers, including , , and Amalric Walter. They developed a new method of incrusting glass by pressing fragments of different coloured glass into the unfinished piece. They often collaborated with the furniture designer Louis Majorelle, whose home and workshops were in Nancy. Another feature of Art Nouveau was the use of stained glass windows with that style of floral themes in residential salons, particularly in the Art Nouveau houses in Nancy. Many were the work of Jacques Grüber, who made windows for the Villa Majorelle and other houses.

In Belgium, the leading firm was the glass factory of Val Saint Lambert, which created vases in organic and floral forms, many of them designed by Philippe Wolfers. Wolfers was noted particularly for creating works of symbolist glass, often with metal decoration attached. In Bohemia, then a region of the Austro-Hungarian Empire noted for crystal manufacture, the companies J. &amp; L. Lobmeyr and Joh. Loetz Witwe also experimented with new colouring techniques, producing more vivid and richer colours. In Germany, experimentation was led by Karl Köpping, who used blown glass to create extremely delicate glasses in the form of flowers; so delicate that few survive today.

In Vienna, the glass designs of the Secession movement were much more geometrical than those of France or Belgium; Otto Prutscher was the most rigorous glass designer of the movement. In Britain, a number of floral stained glass designs were created by Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh for the architectural display called &quot;The House of an Art Lover&quot;.

In the United States, Louis Comfort Tiffany and his designers became particularly famous for their lamps, whose glass shades used common floral themes intricately pieced together. Tiffany lamps gained popularity after the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893, where Tiffany displayed his lamps in a Byzantine-like chapel. Tiffany experimented extensively with the processes of colouring glass, patenting in 1894 the process Favrile glass, which used metallic oxides to colour the interior of the molten glass, giving it an iridescent effect. His workshops produced several different series of the Tiffany lamp in different floral designs, along with stained glass windows, screens, vases and a range of decorative objects. His works were first imported to Germany, then to France by Siegfried Bing, and then became one of the decorative sensations of the 1900 Exposition. An American rival to Tiffany, Steuben Glass, was founded in 1903 in Corning, N.Y., by Frederick Carder, who, like Tiffany, used the Fevrile process to create surfaces with iridescent colours. Another notable American glass artist was John La Farge, who created intricate and colourful stained glass windows on both religious and purely decorative themes.

Examples of stained glass windows in churches can be found in the Art Nouveau religious buildings article.

===Metal art===
The 19th-century architectural theorist Viollet-le-Duc had advocated showing, rather than concealing the iron frameworks of modern buildings, but Art Nouveau architects Victor Horta and Hector Guimard went a step further: they added iron decoration in curves inspired by floral and vegetal forms both in the interiors and exteriors of their buildings. They took the form of stairway railings in the interior, light fixtures, and other details in the interior, and balconies and other ornaments on the exterior. These became some of the most distinctive features of Art Nouveau architecture. The use of metal decoration in vegetal forms soon also appeared in silverware, lamps, and other decorative items.

In the United States, the designer George Grant Elmslie made extremely intricate cast iron designs for the balustrades and other interior decoration of the buildings of Chicago architect Louis Sullivan.

While French and American designers used floral and vegetal forms, Joseph Maria Olbrich and the other Secession artists designed teapots and other metal objects in a more geometric and sober style.

===Jewellery===
Art Nouveau jewellery&#x27;s characteristics include subtle curves and lines. Its design often features natural objects including flowers, animals or birds. The female body is also popular often appearing on cameos. It frequently included long necklaces made of pearls or sterling-silver chains punctuated by glass beads or ending in a silver or gold pendant, itself often designed as an ornament to hold a single, faceted jewel of amethyst, peridot, or citrine.

Art Nouveau jewellery is distinguished by its extensive use of detailed, symbolic motifs that embody the movement&#x27;s deep connection to nature and mythology. Predominant motifs include the ethereal forms of dragonflies and peacocks, which symbolise transformation and beauty, and the detailed depictions of plants and flowers, highlighting nature&#x27;s cyclicality and growth. Intricately designed insects like butterflies and scarabs, often rendered with meticulous enamelling, add a layer of mysticism, symbolising rebirth and protection. This style also frequently featured sinuous figures of women, suggesting sensuality and the connection to the earth. More ominous figures such as snakes and mythical creatures like Medusas and chimeras were used to evoke the darker aspects of the natural and mythical worlds. The use of these motifs was not merely for embellishment; each was imbued with meanings, reflecting Art Nouveau&#x27;s philosophy of integrating art, nature, and spiritual symbolism.

The Art Nouveau period brought a notable stylistic revolution to the jewellery industry, led largely by the major firms in Paris. For the previous two centuries, the emphasis in fine jewellery had been creating dramatic settings for diamonds. During the reign of Art Nouveau, diamonds usually played a supporting role. Jewellers experimented with a wide variety of other stones, including agate, garnet, opal, moonstone, aquamarine and other semi-precious stones, and with a wide variety of new techniques, among others enamelling, and new materials, including horn, moulded glass, and ivory. These materials allowed them to create organic forms and intricate details, highlighting the era&#x27;s departure from traditional jewellery design towards more artistic and expressive creations. Techniques like plique-à-jour enamelling were employed to achieve translucent effects akin to stained glass, adding depth and luminosity to their pieces.

Early notable Paris jewellers in the Art Nouveau style included Louis Aucoc, whose family jewellery firm dated to 1821. The most famous designer of the Art Nouveau period, René Lalique, served his apprenticeship in the Aucoc studio from 1874 to 1876. Lalique became a central figure of Art Nouveau jewellery and glass, using nature, from dragonflies to grasses, as his models. Artists from outside of the traditional world of jewellery, such as Paul Follot, best known as a furniture designer, experimented with jewellery designs. Other notable French Art Nouveau jewellery designers included Jules Brateau and Georges Henry. In the United States, the most famous designer was Louis Comfort Tiffany, whose work was shown at the shop of Siegfried Bing and also at the 1900 Paris Exposition. Siegfried Bing&#x27;s Paris gallery, Maison de l&#x27;Art Nouveau, played a pivotal role in promoting Art Nouveau jewellery. By showcasing works from avant-garde jewellers like René Lalique, Henri Vever, and Edward Colonna, Bing elevated jewellery to the status of fine art and fostered international appreciation for the style.

In Britain, the most prominent figure was the Liberty &amp; Co. &amp; Cymric designer Archibald Knox, who made a variety of Art Nouveau pieces, including silver belt buckles. C. R. Ashbee designed pendants in the shapes of peacocks. The versatile Glasgow designer Charles Rennie Mackintosh also made jewellery, using traditional Celtic symbols. In Germany, the centre for &quot;Jugendstil&quot; jewellery was the city of Pforzheim, where most of the German firms, including Theodor Fahrner, were located. They quickly produced works to meet the demand for the new style.

===Architecture and ornamentation===

Art Nouveau architecture was a reaction against the eclectic styles that dominated European architecture in the second half of the 19th century. It was expressed through decoration: either ornamental (based on flowers and plants, e.g. thistles, irises, cyclamens, orchids, water lilies etc.) or sculptural (see the respective section below). While faces of people (or mascarons) are referred to ornament, the use of people in different forms of sculpture (statues and reliefs: see the respective section below) was also common in some forms of Art Nouveau. Before Vienna Secession, Jugendstil and the various forms of the National romantic style façades were asymmetrical, and often decorated with polychrome ceramic tiles. The decoration usually suggested movement; there was no distinction between the structure and the ornament. A curling or &quot;whiplash&quot; motif, based on the forms of plants and flowers, was widely used in the early Art Nouveau, but decoration became more abstract and symmetrical in Vienna Secession and other later versions of the style, as in the Stoclet Palace in Brussels (1905–1911).

The style first appeared in Brussels&#x27; Hankar House by Paul Hankar (1893) and Hôtel Tassel (1892–93) of Victor Horta. The Hôtel Tassel was visited by Hector Guimard, who used the same style in his first major work, the Castel Béranger (1897–98). Horta and Guimard also designed the furniture and the interior decoration, down to the doorknobs and carpeting. In 1899, based on the fame of the Castel Béranger, Guimard received a commission to design the entrances of the stations of the new Paris Métro, which opened in 1900. Though few of the originals survived, these became the symbol of the Art Nouveau movement in Paris.

In Paris, the architectural style was also a reaction to the strict regulations imposed on building façades by Georges-Eugène Haussmann, the prefect of Paris under Napoleon III. Bow windows were finally allowed in 1903, and Art Nouveau architects went to the opposite extreme, most notably in the houses of Jules Lavirotte, which were essentially large works of sculpture, completely covered with decoration. An important neighbourhood of Art Nouveau houses appeared in the French city of Nancy, around the Villa Majorelle (1901–02), the residence of the furniture designer Louis Majorelle. It was designed by Henri Sauvage as a showcase for Majorelle&#x27;s furniture designs.

Many Art Nouveau buildings were included in UNESCO World Cultural Heritage list as a part of their city centres (in Bern, Budapest, Lviv, Paris, Porto, Prague, Riga, Saint Petersburg, Strasbourg (Neustadt), Vienna). Along with them, there were buildings that were included in the list as separate objects:

* : the works of Victor Horta (Hôtel Tassel, Hôtel Solvay, Hôtel van Eetvelde, Maison and Atelier Horta) and the Stoclet Palace by Josef Hoffmann in Brussels;
* : the works of Lluís Domènech i Montaner (Palau de la Música Catalana and Hospital de Sant Pau in Barcelona), and the works of Antoni Gaudí (Park Güell, Palau Güell, Sagrada Família, Casa Batlló, Casa Milá, Casa Vicens in Barcelona; Colònia Güell in Santa Coloma de Cervelló).

===Sculpture===
Sculpture was another form of expression for Art Nouveau artists, crossing with ceramics sometimes. The porcelain figurine &quot;Dancer with a Scarf&quot; by Agathon Léonard won recognition both in ceramics and in sculpture at the Paris Exposition in 1900. Sculptors of other countries also created ceramic sculptures: Bohemian Stanislav Sucharda and Ladislav Šaloun, Belgian Charles Van der Stappen and Catalan , who created statues of polychrome terracotta. Another notable sculptor of that time was Agustí Querol Subirats from Catalonia who created statues in Spain, Mexico, Argentina, and Cuba.

In architectural sculpture not only statues but also reliefs were used. Art Nouveau architects and sculptors found inspiration in animal motifs (butterflies, peacocks, swans, owls, bats, dragons, bears). Atlantes, caryatids, putti, and gargoyles were also used.

===Furniture===

Furniture design in the Art Nouveau period was closely associated with the architecture of the buildings; the architects often designed the furniture, carpets, light fixtures, doorknobs, and other decorative details. The furniture was often complex and expensive; a fine finish, usually polished or varnished, was regarded as essential, and continental designs were usually very complex, with curving shapes that were expensive to make. It also had the drawback that the owner of the home could not change the furniture or add pieces in a different style without disrupting the entire effect of the room. For this reason, when Art Nouveau architecture went out of style, the style of furniture also largely disappeared.

In France, the centre for furniture design and manufacture was in Nancy, where two major designers, Émile Gallé and Louis Majorelle had their studios and workshops, and where the &quot;Alliance des industries d&#x27;art&quot; (later called the School of Nancy) had been founded in 1901. Both designers based on their structure and ornamentation on forms taken from nature, including flowers and insects, such as the dragonfly, a popular motif in Art Nouveau design. Gallé was particularly known for his use of marquetry in relief, in the form of landscapes or poetic themes. Majorelle was known for his use of exotic and expensive woods, and for attaching bronze sculpted in vegetal themes to his pieces of furniture. Both designers used machines for the first phases of manufacture, but all the pieces were finished by hand. Other notable furniture designers of the Nancy School included Eugène Vallin and Émile André; both were architects by training, and both designed furniture that resembled the furniture from Belgian designers such as Horta and Van de Velde, which had less decoration and followed more closely the curving plants and flowers. 

Other notable French designers included Henri Bellery-Desfontaines, who took his inspiration from the neo-Gothic styles of Viollet-le-Duc; and Georges de Feure, Eugène Gaillard, and Édouard Colonna, who worked together with art dealer Siegfried Bing to revitalize the French furniture industry with new themes. Their work was known for &quot;abstract naturalism&quot;, its unity of straight and curved lines, and its rococo influence. The furniture of de Feure at the Bing pavilion won a gold medal at the 1900 Paris Exposition. The most unusual and picturesque French designer was François-Rupert Carabin, a sculptor by training, whose furniture featured sculpted nude female forms and symbolic animals, particularly cats, who combined Art Nouveau elements with Symbolism. Other influential Paris furniture designers were Charles Plumet, and Alexandre Charpentier. In many ways the old vocabulary and techniques of classic French 18th-century Rococo furniture were re-interpreted in a new style.

In Belgium, the pioneer architects of the &quot;Art Nouveau movement&quot;, Victor Horta and Henry van de Velde, designed furniture for their houses, using vigorous curving lines and a minimum of decoration. The Belgian designer Gustave Serrurier-Bovy added more decoration, applying brass strips in curving forms. In the Netherlands, where the style was called &quot;Nieuwe Kunst&quot; or New Art, H. P. Berlag, Lion Cachet and Theodor Nieuwenhuis followed a different course, that of the English Arts and Crafts movement, with more geometric rational forms.

In Britain, the furniture of Charles Rennie Mackintosh was purely Arts and Crafts, austere and geometrical, with long straight lines and right angles and a minimum of decoration. Continental designs were much more elaborate, often using curved shapes both in the basic shapes of the piece, and in applied decorative motifs. In Germany, the furniture of Peter Behrens and the Jugendstil was largely rationalist, with geometric straight lines and some decoration attached to the surface. Their goal was exactly the opposite of French Art Nouveau; simplicity of structure and simplicity of materials, for furniture that could be inexpensive and easily mass-manufactured. The same was true for the furniture of designers of the Wiener Werkstätte in Vienna, led by Otto Wagner, Josef Hoffmann, Josef Maria Olbrich and Koloman Moser. The furniture was geometric and had a minimum of decoration, though in style it often followed national historic precedent, particularly the Biedemeier style.

Italian and Spanish furniture design went off in their own direction. Carlo Bugatti in Italy designed the extraordinary Snail Chair, wood covered with painted parchment and copper, for the Turin International Exposition of 1902. In Spain, following the lead of Antoni Gaudí and the &quot;Modernismo&quot; movement, the furniture designer Gaspar Homar designed works that were inspired by natural forms with touches of Catalan historic styles.

In the United States, furniture design was more often inspired by the Arts and Crafts movement, or by historic American models, than by the Art Nouveau. One designer who did introduce Art Nouveau themes was Charles Rohlfs in Buffalo, N.Y., whose designs for American white oak furniture were influenced by motifs of Celtic Art and Gothic art, with touches of Art Nouveau in the metal trim applied to the pieces.

===Ceramics===
Ceramic art, including faience, was another flourishing domain for Art Nouveau artists, in the English-speaking countries falling under the wider art pottery movement. The last part of the 19th century saw many technological innovations in the manufacture of ceramics, particularly the development of high temperature (&quot;grand feu&quot;) ceramics with crystallised and matte glazes. At the same time, several lost techniques, such as sang de boeuf glaze, were rediscovered. Art Nouveau ceramics were also influenced by traditional and modern Japanese and Chinese ceramics, whose vegetal and floral motifs fitted well with the Art Nouveau style. In France, artists also rediscovered the traditional stoneware (&quot;grés&quot;) methods and reinvented them with new motifs.

Émile Gallé, in Nancy, created earthenware works in natural earth colors with naturalistic themes of plants and insects. Ceramics also found an important new use in architecture: Art Nouveau architects, Jules Lavirotte and Hector Guimard among them, began to decorate the façades of buildings with architectural ceramics, many of them made by the firm of Alexandre Bigot, giving them a distinct Art Nouveau sculptural look.

One of the pioneer French Art Nouveau ceramists was Ernest Chaplet, whose career in ceramics spanned thirty years. He began producing stoneware influenced by Japanese and Chinese prototypes. Beginning in 1886, he worked with painter Paul Gauguin on stoneware designs with applied figures, multiple handles, painted and partially glazed, and collaborated with sculptors Félix Bracquemond, Jules Dalou and Auguste Rodin. His works were acclaimed at the 1900 Exposition.

The major national ceramics firms had an important place at the 1900 Paris Exposition: the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres outside Paris; Nymphenburg, Meissen, Villeroy &amp; Boch in Germany, and Doulton in Britain. Other leading French ceramists included Taxile Doat, Pierre-Adrien Dalpayrat, Edmond Lachenal, and Auguste Delaherche.

In France, Art Nouveau ceramics sometimes crossed the line into sculpture. The porcelain figurine &quot;Dancer with a Scarf&quot; by Agathon Léonard, made for the Manufacture nationale de Sèvres, won recognition in both categories at the 1900 Paris Exposition.

The Zsolnay factory in Pécs, Hungary, was founded by Miklós Zsolnay (1800–1880) in 1853 and led by his son, Vilmos Zsolnay (1828–1900) with chief designer Tádé Sikorski (1852–1940) to produce stoneware and other ceramics. In 1893, Zsolnay introduced porcelain pieces made of eosin. He led the factory to worldwide recognition by demonstrating its innovative products at world fairs and international exhibitions, including the 1873 World Fair in Vienna, then at the 1878 World Fair in Paris, where Zsolnay received a &quot;Grand Prix&quot;. Frost-resisting Zsolnay building decorations were used in numerous buildings, specifically during the Art Nouveau movement.

Ceramic tiles were also a distinctive feature of Portuguese &quot;Arte Nova&quot; that continued the long azulejo tradition of the country.

====Mosaics====
Mosaics were used by many Art Nouveau artists of different movements, especially of Catalan Modernisme (Hospital de Sant Pau, Palau de la Música Catalana, Casa Lleó-Morera and many others). Antoni Gaudí invented a new technique in the treatment of materials called trencadís, which used waste ceramic pieces.

Colourful Maiolica tile in floral designs were a distinctive feature of the Majolica House in Vienna by Otto Wagner, (1898) and of the buildings of the works of the Russian Abramtsevo Colony, especially those by Mikhail Vrubel.

===Textiles and wallpaper===
Textiles and wallpapers were an important vehicle of Art Nouveau from the beginning of the style, and an essential element of Art Nouveau interior design. In Britain, the textile designs of William Morris had helped launch the Arts and Crafts movement and then Art Nouveau. Many designs were created for the Liberty department store in London, which popularized the style throughout Europe. One such designer was the Silver Studio, which provided colourful stylised floral patterns. Other distinctive designs came from Glasgow School, and Margaret Macdonald Mackintosh. The Glasgow school introduced several distinctive motifs, including stylised eggs, geometric forms and the &quot;Rose of Glasgow&quot;.

In France, a major contribution was made by designer Eugène Grasset who in 1896 published &quot;La Plante et ses applications ornamentales&quot;, suggesting Art Nouveau designs based on different flowers and plants. Many patterns were designed for and produced by for the major French textile manufacturers in Mulhouse, Lille and Lyon, by German and Belgian workshops. The German designer Hermann Obrist specialized in floral patterns, particularly the cyclamen and the &quot;whiplash&quot; style based on flower stems, which became a major motif of the style. The Belgian Henry van de Velde presented a textile work, &quot;La Veillée d&#x27;Anges&quot;, at the Salon &quot;La Libre Esthéthique&quot; in Brussels, inspired by the symbolism of Paul Gauguin and of the Nabis. In the Netherlands, textiles were often inspired by batik patterns from the Dutch colonies in the East Indies. Folk art also inspired the creation of tapestries, carpets, embroidery and textiles in Central Europe and Scandinavia, in the work of Gerhard Munthe and Frida Hansen in Norway. The &quot;Five Swans&quot; design of Otto Eckmann appeared in more than one hundred different versions. The Hungarian designer János Vaszary combined Art Nouveau elements with folkloric themes.

==Museums==
There are 4 types of museums featuring Art Nouveau heritage:
* Broad-scope museums (not specifically dedicated to Art Nouveau but with a large collection of items in this style). &quot;Art Nouveau monuments are italicised&quot;;
* House-museums of Art Nouveau artists (all but Alphonse Mucha museum are Art Nouveau monuments);
* Museums dedicated to local Art Nouveau movements (all are Art Nouveau monuments);
* Other Art Nouveau buildings with museum status or featuring a museum inside (not dedicated to local Art Nouveau movements/specific artists).

There are many other Art Nouveau buildings and structures that do not have museum status but can be officially visited for a fee or unofficially for free (e.g. railway stations, churches, cafes, restaurants, pubs, hotels, stores, offices, libraries, cemeteries, fountains as well as numerous apartment buildings that are still inhabited).

==Posterity==
Criticized for &quot;its primitive extravagances&quot;, Art Nouveau started to fade away after 1911. In histories of European architecture in the 20th century, from the 1930s to the 1950s, influential historians, like Nikolaus Pevsner, Sigfried Giedion and Henry-Russell Hitchcock, did not take Art Nouveau into consideration. This left the first versions of Pevsner&#x27;s &quot;The Genius of European Architecture&quot; without a mention of Hector Guimard or Antoni Gaudí. The first major works dealing with Art Nouveau were published at the end of the 1950s, with Johnny Watser. 

===Influence on Art Deco===
Art Nouveau was one of the factors that led to Art Deco, a style created as a collective effort of multiple French designers to create a new modern style around 1910. This is because Art Nouveau broke the supremacy of 19th-century revivalism and eclecticism, opposing academic conventions. Through its various manifestations, it invented new ornamental systems, no longer dependent on historical formulae, through curvy plant forms in most of the world, geometric decoration in Austria-Hungary and the UK, and reinterpretations of national tradition in the countries of Northern, Central and Eastern Europe. The idea of creating a new style, with new ornaments and shapes, was a significant contribution that Art Nouveau brought to the invention of Art Deco. Another aspect taken from Art Nouveau is the emphasis put on domestic luxury.

Some of the fine details and sinuous lines of Art Nouveau are also found in Art Deco architecture and design of the 1920s, but slightly simplified. Similarly, the flat colours and visible outlines popularized by Art Nouveau posters are very often used in Art Deco illustration. Compared to many Art Nouveau designs, where the vegetal motifs seem to grow and morph on the object or architectural ornament, most Art Deco works have a clear compositional structure, similar to Neoclassicism. 

Aside from ideas taken from Franco-Belgian Art Nouveau, influence came also from the geometric motifs and volumes found in the UK and Vienna. The flowers, spirals and squares found here are very similar to the ones found in Art Deco. Charles Rennie Mackintosh even anticipated Art Deco forms in his later creations. One of the Secessionist works that best anticipates the style is the Stoclet Palace in Brussels, with its ziggurat-shaped setbacks, the vertical slit of the staircase window, and the overall simplicity and modest ornamentation.

===Revivals===
During the 1960s, Postmodernism was born. This was and is a movement that questions Modernism (the status quo after World War II), and promoted the inclusion and reinterpretation of elements of historic styles in new designs. Although several international exhibitions on Art Nouveau happened in the 1950s, a successful revival appeared in the 1960s, and especially in the 1970s with the rise of Postmodernism. Aside from exhibitions, this revival might be connected with the &quot;flower power&quot; generation that set the tone at the time recognized its own life ideals in the floral ornament and the erotically &quot;emancipated&quot; art themes of the years around 1900. 

Art Nouveau was also one of the main sources of inspiration for many posters of psychedelic rock from the same period. Leading proponents of the 1960s psychedelic art movement were San Francisco poster artists such as Rick Griffin, Victor Moscoso, Bonnie MacLean, Stanley Mouse, Alton Kelley, and Wes Wilson. Compared to the earthy colours that characterize Art Nouveau, these posters had highly saturated colours put in contrast, and also highly stylised text, sometimes hard to read. This style flourished from about 1966 to 1972.

Gustav Klimt&#x27;s iconic paintings are found today on many kitschy souvenirs: mugs, plates, napkins, key chains, and so on. &quot;The Kiss&quot; has been printed on countless sizes and materials. In a similar situation are Alphonse Mucha&#x27;s posters.

One of the artists who found in Art Nouveau a major source of inspiration was the Austrian painter and architect Friedensreich Hundertwasser. He took inspiration from multiple sources, including Egon Schiele, Baroque and Persian miniature, and the curvy ornamentation of Art Nouveau.

<doc id="59553" wikidata="Q974792" url="?curid=59553" title="Albuminuria">
<text>Albuminuria is a pathological condition wherein the protein albumin is abnormally present in the urine (&gt;30 mg per day). It is a type of proteinuria. Albumin is a major plasma protein (normally circulating in the blood); in healthy people, only trace amounts of it are present in urine, whereas larger amounts occur in the urine of patients with kidney disease. For a number of reasons, clinical terminology is changing to focus on albuminuria more than proteinuria.

==Signs and symptoms==
It is usually asymptomatic but whitish foam may appear in urine. Swelling of the ankles, hands, belly or face may occur if losses of albumin are significant and produce low serum protein levels (nephrotic syndrome).

==Causes==
The kidneys normally do not filter large molecules into the urine, so albuminuria can be an indicator of damage to the kidneys or excessive salt intake. It can also occur in patients with long-standing diabetes, especially type 1 diabetes. Recent international guidelines (KDIGO 2012) reclassified chronic kidney disease (CKD) based on cause, glomerular filtration rate category, and albuminuria category (A1, A2, A3).

Causes of albuminuria can be discriminated between by the amount of protein excreted.
* Microalbuminuria (between 30 and 300 mg/24h, mg/L of urine or μg/mg of creatinine) can be a forerunner of diabetic nephropathy. The term albuminuria is now preferred in Nephrology since there is not a &quot;small albumin&quot; (&quot;micro&quot;albuminuria) or a &quot;big albumin&quot; (&quot;macro&quot;albuminuria). A1 represents normal to mildly increased urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (&lt;30 mg/g or &lt; 3 mg/mmol); A2 represents moderately increased urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (30–300 mg/g or 3–30 mg/mmol, previously known as microalbuminuria); and A3 reflects severely increased urinary albumin/creatinine ratio &gt;300 mg/g or &gt; 30 mg/mmol).

==Diagnosis==
The amount of protein being lost in the urine can be quantified by collecting the urine for 24 hours, measuring a sample of the pooled urine, and extrapolating to the volume collected.

Also a urine dipstick test for proteinuria can give a rough estimate of albuminuria. This is because albumin is by far the dominant plasma protein, and bromophenol blue the agent used in the dipstick is specific to albumin.

== Treatment ==
Though there is some evidence that dietary interventions (to lower red meat intake) can be helpful in lowering albuminuria levels, there is currently no evidence that low protein interventions correlate to improvement in kidney function. Among other measures, blood pressure control, especially with the use of inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-system, is the most commonly used therapy to control albuminuria.

<doc id="59554" wikidata="Q242667" url="?curid=59554" title="Jesus Christ Superstar">
<text>Jesus Christ Superstar is a sung-through rock opera with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice. Loosely based on the Gospels&#x27; accounts of the Passion, the work interprets the psychology of Jesus and other characters, with much of the plot centred on Judas, who is dissatisfied with the direction in which Jesus is steering his disciples. Contemporary attitudes, sensibilities and slang pervade the rock opera&#x27;s lyrics, and ironic allusions to modern life are scattered throughout the depiction of political events. Stage and film productions accordingly contain many intentional anachronisms.

Initially unable to get backing for a stage production, the composers released it as a concept album, the success of which led to the show&#x27;s Broadway on-stage debut in 1971. By 1980, the musical had grossed more than worldwide. Running for over eight years in London between 1972 and 1980, it held the record for longest-running West End musical before it was overtaken by &quot;Cats&quot; in 1989.

== Plot ==

===Act I===

Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve Apostles, worries that the followers of Jesus are getting out of control and may be seen as a threat by the Roman Empire, who might harshly suppress them (&quot;Heaven on Their Minds&quot;).

The other apostles anticipate entering Jerusalem alongside Jesus and ask him about his plans, but Jesus tells them not to worry about the future. Meanwhile, Mary Magdalene tries to help Jesus relax. Judas warns Jesus to avoid Mary, because a relationship with a prostitute could be seen as inconsistent with his teachings and be used against him. Jesus scolds Judas, saying he should not judge others unless he is free of sin. Jesus then reproaches the apostles and complains that none of them truly care for him (&quot;What&#x27;s the Buzz/Strange Thing Mystifying&quot;).

Mary reassures Jesus while anointing him. Judas fumes that the money spent on fine oil should have been used to help the poor. Jesus reasons they do not have the resources to end poverty, and that they should treasure what comforts they possess (&quot;Everything&#x27;s Alright&quot;). 

Meanwhile, Caiaphas, the High Priest of Israel, assembles the Pharisees and priests. Like Judas, they fear that Jesus&#x27;s followers will be seen as a threat by the Romans, and that many innocent Jews might suffer the consequences. Thus, Caiaphas concludes that for the greater good, Jesus must be executed (&quot;This Jesus Must Die&quot;). As Jesus and his followers arrive exultantly in Jerusalem, they are confronted by Caiaphas, who demands that Jesus disperse the crowd. Jesus instead greets them (&quot;Hosanna&quot;). Simon the Zealot suggests that Jesus lead his mob in a war against Rome and gain absolute power (&quot;Simon Zealotes&quot;). Jesus rejects this, stating that none of his followers understand what true power is (&quot;Poor Jerusalem&quot;).

Pontius Pilate, the governor of Judea, has a dream in which he meets a Galilean and then receives the blame for the man&#x27;s violent death at the hands of a mob (&quot;Pilate&#x27;s Dream&quot;). Jesus arrives at the Temple and finds that it is being used as a marketplace; angered by this, he drives everyone out. A group of lepers ask Jesus to heal them. Their number increases, and overwhelmed, Jesus rejects them (&quot;The Temple&quot;). Mary Magdalene sings Jesus to sleep (&quot;Everything&#x27;s Alright (Reprise)&quot;). While he sleeps, Mary acknowledges that she is in love with him, and it frightens her (&quot;I Don&#x27;t Know How to Love Him&quot;).

Conflicted, Judas seeks out the Pharisees and proposes helping them arrest Jesus, believing that Jesus is out of control and that Jesus himself would approve of this action. In exchange for his help, Judas is offered thirty pieces of silver. Judas adamantly refuses, but then accepts upon Caiaphas&#x27;s suggestion that he could use the money to help the poor (&quot;Damned for All Time/Blood Money&quot;).
===Act II===

Jesus shares a Passover meal with his disciples, where they get drunk and pay little attention to him. He remarks that &quot;for all you care&quot; the wine they are drinking could be his blood and the bread his body. He asks them to remember him, then, frustrated by their lack of understanding, he predicts that Peter will deny him three times that night, and that another one of them will betray him. Judas admits that he is the one who will betray Jesus and, saying that he does not understand why Jesus had no plan, leaves (&quot;The Last Supper&quot;).

The remaining apostles fall asleep as Jesus retreats to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray. He tells God his doubts about whether his mission has had any success and angrily demands to know why he should continue and suffer the horrible death that awaits him. Receiving no answer, he realizes that he cannot defy God&#x27;s will, and surrenders to God. (&quot;Gethsemane (I Only Want to Say)&quot;). Judas arrives with Roman soldiers and identifies Jesus by kissing him on the cheek. When Jesus is brought to trial before the Sanhedrin, Caiaphas and the priests send him to Pilate (&quot;The Arrest&quot;). Meanwhile, Peter is confronted by three witnesses of Jesus&#x27;s arrest, to each of whom he denies that he knows Jesus. Mary observes that Jesus had predicted this (&quot;Peter&#x27;s Denial&quot;).

Pilate asks Jesus if he is the King of the Jews. Jesus answers &quot;that&#x27;s what you say&quot;. Since Jesus is from Galilee, Pilate says that he is not under his jurisdiction and sends him to King Herod (&quot;Pilate and Christ&quot;). The flamboyant King Herod pressures Jesus to prove his divinity by performing miracles, but Jesus ignores him. Herod angrily sends him back to Pilate (&quot;King Herod&#x27;s Song&quot;). Mary Magdalene, Peter, and the apostles remember when they first began following Jesus, and wish that they could return to a time of hope and peace (&quot;Could We Start Again, Please?&quot;).

Judas is horrified at Jesus&#x27;s harsh treatment. He expresses regret to the Pharisees, correctly dreading that he will forever be remembered as a traitor. Caiaphas and Annas assure him that he has done the right thing. Judas throws the money he was given to the floor, and storms out. He curses God for manipulating him, and commits suicide (&quot;Judas&#x27; Death&quot;).

At Jesus&#x27;s trial, Pilate attempts to interrogate Jesus, but is cut off by a bloodthirsty mob which demands that Jesus be crucified. Unnerved, he tells the mob that Jesus has committed no crime and does not deserve to die, but to satisfy the mob he will have Jesus flogged. Pilate pleads with Jesus to defend himself, but Jesus says weakly that everything has been determined by God. The crowd still calls for Jesus&#x27;s death and finally Pilate reluctantly agrees to crucify Jesus (&quot;Trial Before Pilate (Including The 39 Lashes)&quot;).

As Jesus awaits crucifixion, the spirit of Judas returns and questions why Jesus chose to arrive in the manner and time that he did, and if it was all part of a divine plan after all (&quot;Superstar&quot;). Jesus is crucified, recites his final words and dies (&quot;The Crucifixion&quot;). Jesus&#x27; body is taken down from the cross and buried (&quot;John 19:41&quot;).

==Production==

The songs were written and conceived as an album musical, before the musical was created and staged. On the original album, the part of Jesus was sung by Ian Gillan, with Murray Head as Judas, Michael d&#x27;Abo as King Herod, Yvonne Elliman as Mary Magdalene, and Barry Dennen as Pilate. In July 1971, the first authorised American production of the rock opera took place in front of an audience of 13,000 people at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania&#x27;s Civic Arena—staged as a concert, like an oratorio, rather than enacted, with Jeff Fenholt singing the role of Jesus, Carl Anderson as Judas and Elliman repeating as Mary Magdalene.

In August 1971, MCA Records executive David Skepner reported that MCA had been investigating and shutting down 21 unauthorised productions in the US to protect the rights of London-based Leeds Music, which owned the musical. The biggest violations Skepner found were a theatre troupe from Toronto that had crossed the US–Canada border to perform with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, with only a few hours prior announcement, and another big production mounted by the Las Vegas Hilton. Other American cities with unauthorised productions included Washington D.C., Boston, Kansas City, Baltimore, San Francisco, Cincinnati, Richmond, Louisville, Cleveland, St. Louis, Memphis, Atlanta, Columbus, Troy, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, New Orleans, Brooklyn in New York City, and Hollywood, Florida. Court injunctions were obtained in each of these cities to close the shows. Producer Robert Stigwood, who was assembling an authorised touring company, called these unsanctioned groups &quot;outright pirates&quot;, stressing that he would continue to protect his rights by &quot;relentlessly&quot; pursuing legal action.

=== Original Broadway production ===
The musical opened on Broadway on 12 October 1971, directed by Tom O&#x27;Horgan, at the Mark Hellinger Theatre. It starred Jeff Fenholt as Jesus, Ben Vereen as Judas and Bob Bingham as Caiaphas. Dennen and Elliman played the roles that they had sung on the album. Paul Ainsley was Herod. Carl Anderson replaced Vereen when he fell ill, and the two performers later took turns playing the role. The show closed on 30 June 1973 after 711 performances. The production received mixed reviews; the bold casting of African-Americans as Judas was lauded, but reviewer Clive Barnes from &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;the real disappointment was not in the music ... but in the conception.&quot; The show was nominated for five Tony Awards, including Best Score, but won none. Lloyd Webber won a Drama Desk Award as &quot;Most Promising Composer&quot;, and Vereen won a Theatre World Award.

=== Controversy ===
The Broadway show and subsequent productions were condemned by different religious groups. Tim Rice was quoted as saying, &quot;It happens that we don&#x27;t see Christ as God but simply the right man at the right time at the right place.&quot; Christians considered such comments to be blasphemous, the character of Judas too sympathetic, and some of his criticisms of Jesus offensive. The musical&#x27;s lack of allusion to the resurrection of Jesus has resulted in criticism similar to that of fellow musical &quot;Godspell&quot;, which also did not clearly depict a resurrection.

At the same time, some Jews claimed that it bolstered the myth of Jewish deicide by showing most of the villains as Jewish (Caiaphas and the other priests, Herod) and showing the mob in Jerusalem calling for Christ&#x27;s crucifixion.

The musical was banned in South Africa for being &quot;irreligious&quot;, and in the Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic for &quot;distribution of religious propaganda&quot;.

=== Other 1970s and 1980s productions ===

&quot;Superstar&quot; opened at the Palace Theatre in London in 1972, starring Paul Nicholas as Jesus, Stephen Tate as Judas and Dana Gillespie as Mary Magdalene. It was directed by Australian Jim Sharman. This production was much more successful than the original production on Broadway, running for eight years and becoming the United Kingdom&#x27;s longest-running musical at the time. Dmitri Shostakovich attended this production in London just before his death. He regretted that he could not have composed something like it; he lauded especially a rock band underpinning full symphonic strings, brass, and woodwind.

One of the earliest foreign productions was a five-day run in Sweden at Scandinavium in Gothenburg, opening on 18 February 1972 and playing to 74,000 people (a record at the time). Starring as Mary Magdalene was Agnetha Fältskog. On 16 March 1972 an oratorio version was performed at Memorial Drive Park in Adelaide, South Australia as part of the Adelaide Festival of the Arts. This was followed in May by the first official Australian production (A studio production was made in Australia earlier the same year, but it wasn&#x27;t officially licensed), at the Capitol Theatre, Sydney, later moving to the Palais Theatre in Melbourne. Sharman again directed, and the cast included Trevor White as Jesus, Jon English as Judas, and Michele Fawdon (1972–1973) and Marcia Hines (1973–1974) as Mary Magdalene. Hines was the first black woman to play the role.

The production also starred Tim Minchin as Judas, Melanie C as Mary Magdalene and Chris Moyles as King Herod. Lloyd Webber stated, &quot;The funny thing is that &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; [as a rock concert] is what we actually intended it to be. When it is done in a conventional proscenium theatre production it feels shoe-horned in. That is why I wanted to do this.&quot; The tour resumed in March 2013 in the UK, and an Australian leg of the tour commenced in Perth in May 2013. Andrew O&#x27;Keefe played King Herod in Australia, with Jon Stevens, who had played Judas in the 1992 Australian arena tour, as Pilate.

The production returned to Regent&#x27;s Park Open Air Theatre in a socially distanced environment in a concert staging from 14 August to 27 September 2020. The US tour resumed performances on 28 September 2021 at the Keller Auditorium. On 23 November 2021, James D. Beeks, who played Judas in the tour, was arrested for involvement in the 2021 United States Capitol attack. Beeks, performing in the show under the stage name James T. Justis, is alleged to have been one of those who forced entry into the Capitol and to have paid dues to the far right-wing anti-government militia Oath Keepers. Beeks was immediately suspended from the touring production with the role of Judas assumed by another performer in the cast. On 2 December 2021, Tyrone Huntley, who played Judas in the 2016 London production, was announced to have replaced Beeks. A UK tour began at the Palace Theatre, Manchester from September 2023 featuring comedian Julian Clary as Herod.

==Adaptations==
===Films===
A film adaptation of &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; was released in 1973. The film, directed by Norman Jewison, was shot in Israel and other Middle Eastern locations. Ted Neeley, Carl Anderson and Yvonne Elliman were each nominated for a Golden Globe Award for their portrayals of Jesus, Judas and Mary Magdalene, respectively. Bob Bingham (Caiaphas) and Barry Dennen (Pilate) also reprised their roles. A new song, called &quot;Then We Are Decided&quot; and phrased as a dialogue between Caiaphas and Annas, was written for this adaptation.

A second adaptation was filmed in 1999 and released around the world on video in 2000 and 2001. It starred Glenn Carter as Jesus, Jérôme Pradon as Judas, Reneé Castle as Mary Magdalene, and Rik Mayall as Herod, and was directed by Gale Edwards and Nick Morris.

It won the International Emmy Award for Best Performing Arts Film in November 2001.

<text>The number of languages natively spoken in Africa is variously estimated (depending on the delineation of language vs. dialect) at between 1,250 and 2,100, and by some counts at over 3,000. Nigeria alone has over 500 languages (according to SIL Ethnologue), one of the greatest concentrations of linguistic diversity in the world. The languages of Africa belong to many distinct language families, among which the largest are:

*Niger–Congo, which include the large Atlantic-Congo and Bantu branches in West, Central, Southeast and Southern Africa.
*Afroasiatic languages are spread throughout Western Asia, North Africa, the Horn of Africa and parts of the Sahel.
*Saharan, Nilotic and Central Sudanic languages (previously grouped under the hypothetical Nilo-Saharan macro-family), are present in East Africa and Sahel.
*Austronesian languages are spoken in Madagascar and parts of the Comoros.
*Khoe–Kwadi languages are spoken mostly in Namibia and Botswana.
*Indo-European languages, while not indigenous to Africa, are spoken in South Africa and Namibia (Afrikaans, English, German) and are used as lingua francas in Liberia and the former colonies of the United Kingdom (English), former colonies of France and of Belgium (French), former colonies of Portugal (Portuguese), former colonies of Italy (Italian), former colonies of Spain (Spanish) and the current Spanish territories of Ceuta, Melilla and the Canary Islands and the current French territories of Mayotte and La Réunion.

There are several other small families and language isolates, as well as creoles and languages that have yet to be classified. In addition, Africa has a wide variety of sign languages, many of which are language isolates.

Around a hundred languages are widely used for interethnic communication. These include Arabic, Swahili, Amharic, Oromo, Igbo, Somali, Hausa, Manding, Fulani and Yoruba, which are spoken as a second (or non-first) language by millions of people. Although many African languages are used on the radio, in newspapers and in primary-school education, and some of the larger ones are considered national languages, only a few are official at the national level. In Sub-Saharan Africa, most official languages at the national level tend to be colonial languages such as French, Portuguese, or English.

The African Union declared 2006 the &quot;Year of African Languages&quot;.

==Language groups==

Most languages natively spoken in Africa belong to one of the two large language families that dominate the continent: Afroasiatic, or Niger–Congo. Another hundred belong to smaller families such as Ubangian, Nilotic, Saharan, and the various families previously grouped under the umbrella term Khoisan. In addition, the languages of Africa include several unclassified languages and sign languages.

The earliest Afroasiatic languages are associated with the Capsian culture, the Saharan languages are linked with the Khartoum Mesolithic/Neolithic cultures. Niger-Congo languages are correlated with the west and central African hoe-based farming traditions and the Khoisan languages are matched with the south and southeastern Wilton culture. 

===Afroasiatic languages===

Afroasiatic languages are spoken throughout North Africa, the Horn of Africa, Western Asia and parts of the Sahel. There are approximately 375 Afroasiatic languages spoken by over 400 million people. The main subfamilies of Afroasiatic are Berber, Chadic, Cushitic, Omotic, Egyptian and Semitic. The Afroasiatic Urheimat is uncertain. The family&#x27;s most extensive branch, the Semitic languages (including Arabic, Amharic and Hebrew among others), is the only branch of Afroasiatic that is spoken outside Africa.

Some of the most widely spoken Afroasiatic languages include Arabic (a Semitic language, and a recent arrival from West Asia), Somali (Cushitic), Berber (Berber), Hausa (Chadic), Amharic (Semitic) and Oromo (Cushitic). Of the world&#x27;s surviving language families, Afroasiatic has the longest written history, as both the Akkadian language of Mesopotamia and Ancient Egyptian are members.

===Nilo-Saharan languages===
Nilo-Saharan languages are a proposed grouping of some one hundred diverse languages. Genealogical linkage between these languages has failed to be conclusively demonstrated, and support for the proposal is sparse among linguists. The languages share some unusual morphology, but if they are related, most of the branches must have undergone major restructuring since diverging from their common ancestor. 

This hypothetical family would reach an expanse that stretches from the Nile Valley to northern Tanzania and into Nigeria and DR Congo, with the Songhay languages along the middle reaches of the Niger River as a geographic outlier. The inclusion of the Songhay languages is questionable, and doubts have been raised over the Koman, Gumuz and Kadu branches.

Some of the better known Nilo-Saharan languages are Kanuri, Fur, Songhay, Nobiin and the widespread Nilotic family, which includes the Luo, Dinka and Maasai. Most Nilo-Saharan languages are tonal, as are Niger-Congo languages.

===Niger–Congo languages===
The Niger–Congo languages constitute the largest language family spoken in West Africa and perhaps the world in terms of the number of languages. One of its salient features is an elaborate noun class system with grammatical concord. A large majority of languages of this family are tonal such as Yoruba and Igbo, Akan and Ewe language. A major branch of Niger–Congo languages is the Bantu phylum, which has a wider speech area than the rest of the family (see Niger–Congo B (Bantu) in the map above).

The Niger–Kordofanian language family, joining Niger–Congo with the Kordofanian languages of south-central Sudan, was proposed in the 1950s by Joseph Greenberg. Today, linguists often use &quot;Niger–Congo&quot; to refer to this entire family, including Kordofanian as a subfamily. One reason for this is that it is not clear whether Kordofanian was the first branch to diverge from rest of Niger–Congo. Mande has been claimed to be equally or more divergent. Niger–Congo is generally accepted by linguists, though a few question the inclusion of Mande and Dogon, and there is no conclusive evidence for the inclusion of Ubangian.

===Other language families===
Several languages spoken in Africa belong to language families concentrated or originating outside the African continent.

====Austronesian====
Malagasy belongs to the Austronesian languages and is the westernmost branch of the family. It is the national and co-official language of Madagascar, and a Malagasy dialect called Bushi is also spoken in Mayotte.
The ancestors of the Malagasy people migrated to Madagascar around 1,500 years ago from Southeast Asia, more specifically the island of Borneo. The origins of how they arrived to Madagascar remains a mystery, however the Austronesians are known for their seafaring culture. Despite the geographical isolation, Malagasy still has strong resemblance to Barito languages especially the Ma&#x27;anyan language of southern Borneo. 

With more than 20 million speakers, Malagasy is one of the most widely spoken of the Austronesian languages.

====Indo-European====
Afrikaans is Indo-European, as is most of the vocabulary of most African creole languages. Afrikaans evolved from the Dutch vernacular of South Holland (Hollandic dialect) spoken by the mainly Dutch settlers of what is now South Africa, where it gradually began to develop distinguishing characteristics in the course of the 18th century, including the loss of verbal conjugation (save for 5 modal verbs), as well as grammatical case and gender. Most Afrikaans speakers live in South Africa. In Namibia it is the lingua franca. Overall 15 to 20 million people are estimated to speak Afrikaans.

Since the colonial era, Indo-European languages such as Afrikaans, English, French, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish have held official status in many countries, and are widely spoken, generally as lingua francas. (&quot;See African French and African Portuguese&quot;.) Additionally, languages like French, and Portuguese have become native languages in various countries.

French has become native in the urban areas of the DRC, and Gabon.

German was once used in Germany&#x27;s colonies there from the late 1800s until World War I, when Britain and France took over and revoked German&#x27;s official status. Despite this, German is still spoken in Namibia, mostly among the white population. Although it lost its official status in the 1990s, it has been redesignated as a national language. Indian languages such as Gujarati are spoken by South Asian expatriates exclusively. In earlier historical times, other Indo-European languages could be found in various parts of the continent, such as Old Persian and Greek in Egypt, Latin and Vandalic in North Africa and Modern Persian in the Horn of Africa.

====Small families====
The three small Khoisan families of southern Africa have not been shown to be closely related to any other major language family. In addition, there are various other families that have not been demonstrated to belong to one of these families. The classifications below follow Glottolog.
*Mande, some 70 languages, including the major languages of Mali and Guinea; these are generally thought to be divergent Niger–Congo, but debate persists
*Ubangian, some 70 languages, centered on the languages of the Central African Republic; may be Niger–Congo
*Te-Ne-Omotic, some 20 languages, previously classified under Afro-Asiatic, spoken in Ethiopia
*Khoe-Kwadi, around 10 languages, the primary family of Khoisan languages of Namibia and Botswana
*Surmic, some 11 languages, previously classified within either Sudanic or Nilo-Saharan
*Kx&#x27;a, around five languages, with various dialects, spoken in Southern Africa
*South Omotic, around five languages; previously classified within Afro-Asiatic, spoken in Ethiopia
*Tuu, or Taa-ǃKwi, two surviving languages
*Hadza, an isolate of Tanzania
*Bangime, a likely isolate of Mali
*Jalaa, a likely isolate of Nigeria
*Sandawe, an isolate of Tanzania
*Laal, a possible isolate of Chad

&quot;Khoisan&quot; is a term of convenience covering some 30 languages spoken by around 300,000–400,000 people. There are five Khoisan families that have not been shown to be related to each other: Khoe, Tuu and Kx&#x27;a, which are found mainly in Namibia and Botswana, as well as Sandawe and Hadza of Tanzania, which are language isolates. A striking feature of Khoisan languages, and the reason they are often grouped together, is their use of click consonants. Some neighbouring Bantu languages (notably Xhosa and Zulu) have clicks as well, but these were adopted from Khoisan languages. The Khoisan languages are also tonal.

====Creole languages====
Due partly to its multilingualism and its colonial past, a substantial proportion of the world&#x27;s creole languages are to be found in Africa. Some are based on Indo-European languages (e.g. Krio from English in Sierra Leone and the very similar Pidgin in Nigeria, Ghana and parts of Cameroon; Cape Verdean Creole in Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau Creole in Guinea-Bissau and Senegal, all from Portuguese; Seychellois Creole in the Seychelles and Mauritian Creole in Mauritius, both from French); some are based on Arabic (e.g. Juba Arabic in the southern Sudan, or Nubi in parts of Uganda and Kenya); some are based on local languages (e.g. Sango, the main language of the Central African Republic); while in Cameroon a creole based on French, English and local African languages known as Camfranglais has started to become popular.

====Unclassified languages====

A fair number of unclassified languages are reported in Africa. Many remain unclassified simply for lack of data; among the better-investigated ones that continue to resist easy classification are:

* possibly Afroasiatic: Ongota, Gomba
* possibly Nilo-Saharan: Shabo
* possibly Niger–Congo: Jalaa, Mbre, Bayot
* unknown: Laal, Mpre
Of these, Jalaa is perhaps the most likely to be an isolate.

Less-well investigated languages include Irimba, Luo, Mawa, Rer Bare (possibly Bantu languages), Bete (evidently Jukunoid), Bung (unclear), Kujarge (evidently Chadic), Lufu (Jukunoid), Meroitic (possibly Afroasiatic), Oropom (possibly spurious) and Weyto (evidently Cushitic). Several of these are extinct, and adequate comparative data is thus unlikely to be forthcoming. Hombert &amp; Philippson (2009) list a number of African languages that have been classified as language isolates at one point or another. Many of these are simply unclassified, but Hombert &amp; Philippson believe Africa has about twenty language families, including isolates. Beside the possibilities listed above, there are:

*Aasax or Aramanik (Tanzania) (South Cushitic? contains non-Cushitic lexicon)
*Imeraguen (Mauritania) – Hassaniyya Arabic restructured on an Azêr (Soninke) base
*Kara (Fer?) (Central African Republic)
*Oblo (Cameroon) (Adamawa? Extinct?)
Roger Blench notes a couple additional possibilities:
*Defaka (Nigeria)
*Dompo (Ghana)

Below is a list of language isolates and otherwise unclassified languages in Africa, from Vossen &amp; Dimmendaal (2020:434):

====Sign languages====

Many African countries have national sign languages, such as Algerian Sign Language, Tunisian Sign Language, Ethiopian Sign Language. Other sign languages are restricted to small areas or single villages, such as Adamorobe Sign Language in Ghana. Tanzania has seven, one for each of its schools for the Deaf, all of which are discouraged. Not much is known, since little has been published on these languages

Sign language systems extant in Africa include the Paget Gorman Sign System used in Namibia and Angola, the Sudanese Sign languages used in Sudan and South Sudan, the Arab Sign languages used across the Arab Mideast, the Francosign languages used in Francophone Africa and other areas such as Ghana and Tunisia, and the Tanzanian Sign languages used in Tanzania.

==Language in Africa==
Throughout the long multilingual history of the African continent, African languages have been subject to phenomena like language contact, language expansion, language shift and language death. A case in point is the Bantu expansion, in which Bantu-speaking peoples expanded over most of Sub-Equatorial Africa, intermingling with Khoi-San speaking peoples from much of Southeast Africa and Southern Africa and other peoples from Central Africa. Another example is the Arab expansion in the 7th century, which led to the extension of Arabic from its homeland in Asia, into much of North Africa and the Horn of Africa.

Trade languages are another age-old phenomenon in the African linguistic landscape. Cultural and linguistic innovations spread along trade routes and languages of peoples dominant in trade developed into languages of wider communication (lingua franca). Of particular importance in this respect are Berber (North and West Africa), Jula (western West Africa), Fulfulde (West Africa), Hausa (West Africa), Lingala (Congo), Swahili (Southeast Africa), Somali (Horn of Africa) and Arabic (North Africa and Horn of Africa).

After gaining independence, many African countries, in the search for national unity, selected one language, generally the former Indo-European colonial language, to be used in government and education. However, in recent years, African countries have become increasingly supportive of maintaining linguistic diversity. Language policies that are being developed nowadays are mostly aimed at multilingualism. This presents a methodological complication when collecting data in Africa and limited literature exists. An analysis of Afrobarometer public opinion survey data of 36 countries suggested that survey interviewers and respondents could engage in various linguistic behaviors, such as code-switching during the survey. Moreover, some African countries have been considering removing their official former Indo-European colonial languages, like Mali and Burkina Faso which removed French as an official language in 2024.

===Cross-border languages===
The colonial borders established by European powers following the Berlin Conference in 1884–1885 divided a great many ethnic groups and African language speaking communities. This can cause divergence of a language on either side of a border (especially when the official languages are different), for example, in orthographic standards. Some notable cross-border languages include Berber (which stretches across much of North Africa and some parts of West Africa), Kikongo (that stretches across northern Angola, western and coastal Democratic Republic of the Congo, and western and coastal Republic of the Congo), Somali (stretches across most of the Horn of Africa), Swahili (spoken in the African Great Lakes region), Fula (in the Sahel and West Africa) and Luo (in Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, South Sudan and Sudan).

Some prominent Africans such as former Malian president and former Chairman of the African Commission, Alpha Oumar Konaré, have referred to cross-border languages as a factor that can promote African unity.

===Language change and planning===
Language is not static in Africa any more than on other continents. In addition to the (likely modest) impact of borders, there are also cases of dialect levelling (such as in Igbo and probably many others), koinés (such as N&#x27;Ko and possibly Runyakitara) and emergence of new dialects (such as Sheng). In some countries, there are official efforts to develop standardized language versions.

There are also many less widely spoken languages that may be considered endangered languages.

===Demographics===

Of the 1 billion Africans (in 2009), about 17 percent speak an Arabic dialect. About 10 percent speak Swahili, the lingua franca of Southeast Africa; about 5 percent speak a Berber dialect; and about 5 percent speak Hausa, which serves as a lingua franca in much of the Sahel. Other large West African languages are Yoruba, Igbo, Akan and Fula. Major Horn of Africa languages are Somali, Amharic and Oromo. Lingala is important in Central Africa. Important South African languages are Sotho, Tswana, Pedi, Venda, Tsonga, Swazi, Southern Ndebele, Zulu, Xhosa and Afrikaans.

French, English, and Portuguese are important languages in Africa due to colonialism. About 320 million, 240 million and 35 million Africans, respectively, speak them as either native or secondary languages. Portuguese has become the national language of Angola and São Tomé and Príncipe, and Portuguese is the official language of Mozambique.

==Linguistic features==
Some linguistic features are particularly common among languages spoken in Africa, whereas others are less common. Such shared traits probably are not due to a common origin of all African languages. Instead, some may be due to language contact (resulting in borrowing) and specific idioms and phrases may be due to a similar cultural background.

===Phonological===
Some widespread phonetic features include:
* certain types of consonants, such as implosives (), ejectives (), the labiodental flap and in southern Africa, clicks (, ). True implosives are rare outside Africa, and clicks and the flap almost unheard of.
* doubly articulated labial-velar stops like and are found in places south of the Sahara.
* prenasalized consonants, like and , are widespread in Africa but not common outside it.
* sequences of stops and fricatives at the beginnings of words, such as , and .
* nasal stops which only occur with nasal vowels, such as vs. (but both and ), especially in West Africa.
* vowels contrasting an advanced or retracted tongue, commonly called &quot;tense&quot; and &quot;lax&quot;.
* simple tone systems which are used for grammatical purposes.

Sounds that are relatively uncommon in African languages include uvular consonants, diphthongs and front rounded vowels

Tonal languages are found throughout the world but are especially common in Africa - in fact, there are far more tonal than non-tonal languages in Africa. Both the Nilo-Saharan and the Khoi-San phyla are fully tonal. The large majority of the Niger–Congo languages are also tonal. Tonal languages are also found in the Omotic, Chadic and South &amp; East Cushitic branches of Afroasiatic. The most common type of tonal system opposes two tone levels, High (H) and Low (L). Contour tones do occur, and can often be analysed as two or more tones in succession on a single syllable. &quot;Tone melodies&quot; play an important role, meaning that it is often possible to state significant generalizations by separating tone sequences (&quot;melodies&quot;) from the segments that bear them. Tonal sandhi processes like tone spread, tone shift, downstep and downdrift are common in African languages.
===Syntactic===
Widespread syntactical structures include the common use of adjectival verbs and the expression of comparison by means of a verb &#x27;to surpass&#x27;. The Niger–Congo languages have large numbers of genders (noun classes) which cause agreement in verbs and other words. Case, tense and other categories may be distinguished only by tone. Auxiliary verbs are also widespread among African languages; the fusing of subject markers and TAM/polarity auxiliaries into what are known as tense pronouns are more common in auxiliary verb constructions in African languages than in most other parts of the world.

===Semantic===
Quite often, only one term is used for both animal and meat; the word &quot;nama&quot; or &quot;nyama&quot; for animal/meat is particularly widespread in otherwise widely divergent African languages.

<text>The Palau Güell (, ) is a mansion designed by the architect Antoni Gaudí for the industrial tycoon Eusebi Güell, and was built between 1886 and 1888. It is situated on the Carrer Nou de la Rambla, in the El Raval neighborhood of Barcelona in Catalonia, Spain. It is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site &quot;Works of Antoni Gaudí&quot;.

The home is centered around the main room for entertaining high society guests. Guests entered the home in horse-drawn carriages through the front iron gates, which featured a parabolic arch and intricate patterns of forged ironwork resembling seaweed and in some parts a horsewhip. Animals could be taken down a ramp and kept in the livery stable in the basement where the servants resided, while the guests went up the stairs to the receiving room. The ornate walls and ceilings of the receiving room disguised small viewing windows high on the walls where the owners of the home could view their guests from the upper floor and get a &quot;sneak peek&quot; before greeting them, in case they needed to adjust their attire accordingly.

The main party room has a tall ceiling with small holes near the top where lanterns were hung at night from the outside to give the appearance of a starlit sky.

In 2004, visits by the public were completely suspended due to renovations; some of the stone used in the original construction was weak and had cracked over the years causing structural problems within the building. It is currently completely open, with all restoration work completed in April 2011.

It was used in Antonioni&#x27;s film &quot;The Passenger&quot; as a backdrop for the first meeting between Jack Nicholson and Maria Schneider.

<text>Pierre Brissaud (23 December 1885 – 17 October 1964) was a French Art Deco illustrator, painter, and engraver. He was born in Paris and trained at the École des Beaux-Arts and Atelier Fernand Cormon in Montmartre, Paris. His father was Dr. Édouard Brissaud, a student of Dr. Jean-Martin Charcot. His fellow students at Cormon were his brother Jacques, André-Édouard Marty, Charles Martin, and Georges Lepape. Students at the workshop drew, painted and designed wallpaper, furniture and posters. Earlier, Toulouse-Lautrec, van Gogh, and Henri Matisse had studied and worked there. Pierre&#x27;s older brother Jacques Brissaud was a portrait and genre painter and his uncle Maurice Boutet de Monvel illustrated the fables of La Fontaine, songbooks for children and a life of Joan of Arc. A first cousin was the celebrated artist and celebrity portrait painter Bernard Boutet de Monvel.

Brissaud is known for his &quot;pochoir&quot; (stencil) prints for the fashion magazine &quot;Gazette du Bon Ton&quot; published by Lucien Vogel in Paris. Many of Brissaud&#x27;s illustrations are realistic leisure scenes of the well-to-do. They illustrate the designs of Paris fashion houses such as Jeanne Lanvin, Chéruit, Worth, and Doucet. Brissaud&#x27;s illustrations appeared in &quot;Vogue&quot; after it bought &quot;Bon Ton&quot; in 1925, as well as &quot;House &amp; Garden&quot; and &quot;Fortune&quot;, and in books like &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;, &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;, &quot;Mémoires de Saint-Simon&quot;, the autobiographical novels of Anatole France, &quot;Two gentlemen of Verona&quot; and many others.

In 1907 he exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants and the Salon d&#x27;Automne.

<text>(; &quot;Youth Style&quot;) was an artistic movement, particularly in the decorative arts, that was influential primarily in Germany and elsewhere in Europe to a lesser extent from about 1895 until about 1910. It was the German counterpart of Art Nouveau. The members of the movement were reacting against the historicism and neo-classicism of the official art and architecture academies. It took its name from the art journal , founded by the German artist Georg Hirth. It was especially active in the graphic arts and interior decoration.

Its major centers of activity were Munich and Weimar and the Darmstadt Artists&#x27; Colony founded in Darmstadt in 1901. Important figures of the movement included the Swiss graphic artist Hermann Obrist, Otto Eckmann, and the Belgian architect and decorator Henry van de Velde. In its earlier years, the style was influenced by the British Modern Style. It was also influenced by Japanese prints. Later, under the Secessionists&#x27; influence, it tended toward abstraction and more geometrical forms.

==History==
The movement had its origins in Munich with the founding of an association of visual artists in 1892, which broke away from the more formal historical and academic styles of the Academy. Georg Hirth chose the name Munich Secession for the association. Later, the Vienna Secession, founded in 1897 and the Berlin Secession took their own names from the Munich group. The journal of the group, &quot;Jugend&quot;, begun in 1896, along with another Munich publication, &quot;Simplicissimus&quot; and &quot;Pan&quot; in Berlin, became the most visible showcases of the new style. The leading figures of this movement, including Peter Behrens, Bernhard Pankok, and Richard Riemerschmid, as well as the majority of the founding members of the Munich Secession, all provided illustrations to &quot;Jugend&quot;.

In the beginning, the style was used primarily in illustrations and graphic arts. &quot;Jugendstil&quot; combined floral decoration and sinuous curves with more geometric lines, and soon was used for covers of novels, advertisements, and exhibition posters. Designers often created original styles of typeface that worked harmoniously with the image, such as the Arnold Böcklin typeface created in 1904.

Otto Eckmann was one of the most prominent German artists associated with both &quot;Jugend&quot; and &quot;Pan&quot;. His favourite animal was the swan, and so great was his influence that the swan came to serve as the symbol of the entire movement. Another prominent designer in the style was Richard Riemerschmid, who made furniture, pottery, and other decorative objects in a sober, geometric style that pointed forward toward Art Deco. The Swiss artist Hermann Obrist, living in Munich, made designs with sinuous double curves, modeled after plants and flowers, which were a prominent motif of the early style.

===Joseph Maria Olbrich and the Darmstadt Artists&#x27; Colony ===
The Darmstadt Artists&#x27; Colony is a remarkable collection of &quot;Jugendstil&quot; buildings created beginning in 1899 by Ernest Ludwig, Grand Duke of Hesse, a grandson of Queen Victoria, to promote both commerce and the arts. He brought together a group of designers to create his new community, including Peter Behrens, Hans Christiansen, and Joseph Maria Olbrich. The Colony architecture represented a complete break with the earlier floral style, and was much bolder in its design. Behrens and several of the other architects built their own houses there, and designed every detail, from the doorknobs to the dishes.

The most impressive building of the Colony is the Ernst-Ludwig House, named for the Grand Duke, which contained the workshops of the artists. It was designed by Olbrich, with an entrance in the form of a three-quarter circle, flanked by two statues, &quot;Force&quot; and &quot;Beauty&quot;, by Ludwig Habich (1901). 


=== Henry van de Velde and Weimar ===
The city of Weimar was another important center of the &quot;Jugendstil&quot;, thanks largely to the Belgian architect and designer Henry van de Velde. Van de Velde had played an important role in the early Belgian Art Nouveau, building his own house and decorating it in Art Nouveau style, with the strong influence of the British Arts and Crafts Movement. He was a known in Germany for his work in Belgium and Paris, and began a new career in Dresden in 1897, with a display at the Dresden Exposition of decorative arts. His work became known in Germany through decorative arts journals, and he received several commissions for interiors in Berlin, for a villa in Chemnitz, the Folkwang Museum in Hagen, and the Nietzsche House in Weimar for Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, the sister of philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. He settled in Weimar in 1899 and produced a wide variety of decorative works, including silverware and ceramics, all in strikingly original forms. His silverware was particularly unusual: each piece had its own form, with sleek curving lines, but together they formed a harmonious ensemble. In 1902, he decorated the apartment of Count Harry Kessler, a prominent patron of the Impressionist painters.

In 1905, with the patronage of the Grand Duke of Weimar, he created the Grand Ducal School of Arts and Crafts in Weimar. He created a showcase of applied arts for the Dresden Exposition of Applied Arts in 1906, decorated with paintings by Ludwig von Hofmann, intended as the main room of a new museum of decoration in Weimar. He transposed the characteristics of his silverware, dishes, and furniture into the architecture. Van de Velde left off the curling vegetal lines of Art Nouveau decoration and replaced them with much simpler, more stylized curves which were part of the structure of his buildings and decorative works.

The importance of Weimar as a cultural center of the &quot;Jugendstil&quot; was ended in 1906, when its main patron, Count Harry Kessler, commissioned Rodin to make a nude statue for the Grand Duke. The Grand Duke was scandalized, and Kessler was forced to resign. The Weimar school of design lost its importance until 1919, when it returned as the Bauhaus under Walter Gropius, and played a major part in the emergence of modern architecture.

=== Peter Behrens and the German &quot;Werkbund&quot; ===
The architect and designer Peter Behrens (1868–1940) was a key figure in the final years of the &quot;Jugendstil&quot;, and in the transition to modern architecture. Born in Hamburg, where he studied painting, Behrens moved to Munich in 1890 and worked as a painter, illustrator and bookbinder. In 1890, he was one of the founders of the Munich Secession. In 1899, he was invited to participate in the Darmstadt Artists&#x27; Colony, where he designed his own house and all of its contents, including the furniture, towels and dishes.

After 1900 he became involved in industrial design and the reform of architecture to more functional forms. In 1902, he participated in the Turin International Exposition, one of the first major Europe-wide showcases of Art Nouveau. In 1907, Behrens and a group of other notable &quot;Jugendstil&quot; artists, including (Hermann Muthesius, Theodor Fischer, Josef Hoffmann, Joseph Maria Olbrich, Bruno Paul, Richard Riemerschmid, and Fritz Schumacher, created the Deutscher Werkbund. Modeled after the Arts and Crafts movement in England, its goal was to improve and modernize the design of industrial products and everyday objects. He first major project was AEG turbine factory in Berlin (1908–1909). Behren&#x27;s assistants and students at this time included Mies van der Rohe, C. E. Jeanerette (the future Le Corbusier), and Walter Gropius, the future head of the Bauhaus. The work of Behrens and the Werkbund effectively launched the transition from the &quot;Jugendstil&quot; to modernism in Germany, and the end of the &quot;Jugendstil&quot;.

==Architecture and decoration==
In Berlin, August Endell was both editor of &quot;Pan&quot; magazine and a major figure in &quot;Jugendstil&quot; decoration, designing hotels and theaters, such as the interior of Buntes Theater in Berlin (1901), destroyed during World War II. He designed every detail of the interior down to the nails. with each room in a different color, and on a different theme. He also designed the Hackesche Höfe, a complex of buildings in the centre of Berlin, noted for the imaginative details of the decoration, in spirals and curling forms,

==Posters and graphic arts==

The most prominent graphic artist was Otto Eckmann, who produced numerous illustrations for the movement&#x27;s journal &quot;Jugend&quot;, in a sinuous, floral style that was similar to the French style. He also created a type style based upon Japanese calligraphy. Joseph Sattler was another graphic artist who contributed to the style through another artistic journal called &quot;Pan&quot;. Sattler designed a type face often used in &quot;Jugendstil&quot;.

Another important German graphic artist was Josef Rudolf Witzel (1867–1925), who produced many early covers for &quot;Jugend&quot;, with curving, floral forms which helped shape the style.

The magazine &quot;Simplicissimus&quot;, published in Munich, was also noted for its &quot;Jugendstil&quot; graphics, as well as for the modern writers it presented, including Thomas Mann and Rainer Maria Rilke. Important illustrators for the magazine included Thomas Theodor Heine.

==Furniture==
The ideal of designers of the &quot;Jugendstil&quot; was to make a house a complete work of art, with everything inside, from the furniture to the carpets and the dishware, silverware and the art, in perfect harmony. With this ideal in mind, they established their own workshops to produce furniture.

August Endell, Theodor Fischer, Bruno Paul, and especially Richard Riemerschmid were important figures in &quot;Jugendstil&quot; furniture. 


==Metalware==
Metallwarenfabrik Straub &amp; Schweizer (WMF) was, by 1900, the world&#x27;s largest producer of household metalware, mainly in the &quot;Jugendstil&quot; style, designed in the WMF Art Studio under Albert Mayer. WMF purchased Orivit, another company known for its &quot;Jugendstil&quot; pewter, in 1905.

<text>The Enterprise Objects Framework, or simply EOF, was introduced by NeXT in 1994 as a pioneering object-relational mapping product for its NeXTSTEP and OpenStep development platforms. EOF abstracts the process of interacting with a relational database by mapping database rows to Java or Objective-C objects. This largely relieves developers from writing low-level SQL code.

EOF enjoyed some niche success in the mid-1990s among financial institutions who were attracted to the rapid application development advantages of NeXT&#x27;s object-oriented platform. Since Apple Inc&#x27;s merger with NeXT in 1996, EOF has evolved into a fully integrated part of WebObjects, an application server also originally from NeXT. Many of the core concepts of EOF re-emerged as part of Core Data, which further abstracts the underlying data formats to allow it to be based on non-SQL stores.

== History ==
In the early 1990s NeXT Computer recognized that connecting to databases was essential to most businesses and yet also potentially complex. Every data source has a different data-access language (or API), driving up the costs to learn and use each vendor&#x27;s product. The NeXT engineers wanted to apply the advantages of object-oriented programming, by getting objects to &quot;talk&quot; to relational databases. As the two technologies are very different, the solution was to create an abstraction layer, insulating developers from writing the low-level procedural code (SQL) specific to each data source.

The first attempt came in 1992 with the release of Database Kit (DBKit), which wrapped an object-oriented framework around any database. Unfortunately, NEXTSTEP at the time was not powerful enough and DBKit had serious design flaws.

NeXT&#x27;s second attempt came in 1994 with the Enterprise Objects Framework (EOF) version 1, a complete rewrite that was far more modular and OpenStep compatible. EOF 1.0 was the first product released by NeXT using the Foundation Kit and introduced autoreleased objects to the developer community. The development team at the time was only four people: Jack Greenfield, Rich Williamson, Linus Upson and Dan Willhite. EOF 2.0, released in late 1995, further refined the architecture, introducing the editing context. At that point, the development team consisted of Dan Willhite, Craig Federighi, Eric Noyau and Charly Kleissner.

EOF achieved a modest level of popularity in the financial programming community in the mid-1990s, but it would come into its own with the emergence of the World Wide Web and the concept of web applications. It was clear that EOF could help companies plug their legacy databases into the Web without any rewriting of that data. With the addition of frameworks to do state management, load balancing and dynamic HTML generation, NeXT was able to launch the first object-oriented Web application server, WebObjects, in 1996, with EOF at its core.

In 2000, Apple Inc. (which had merged with NeXT) officially dropped EOF as a standalone product, meaning that developers would be unable to use it to create desktop applications for the forthcoming Mac OS X. It would, however, continue to be an integral part of a major new release of WebObjects. WebObjects 5, released in 2001, was significant for the fact that its frameworks had been ported from their native Objective-C programming language to the Java language. Critics of this change argue that most of the power of EOF was a side effect of its Objective-C roots, and that EOF lost the beauty or simplicity it once had. Third-party tools, such as EOGenerator, help fill the deficiencies introduced by Java (mainly due to the loss of categories).

The Objective-C code base was re-introduced with some modifications to desktop application developers as Core Data, part of Apple&#x27;s Cocoa API, with the release of Mac OS X Tiger in April 2005.

==How EOF works==

Enterprise Objects provides tools and frameworks for object-relational mapping. The technology specializes in providing mechanisms to retrieve data from various data sources, such as relational databases via JDBC and JNDI directories, and mechanisms to commit data back to those data sources. These mechanisms are designed in a layered, abstract approach that allows developers to think about data retrieval and commitment at a higher level than a specific data source or data source vendor.

Central to this mapping is a model file (an &quot;EOModel&quot;) that you build with a visual tool — either EOModeler, or the EOModeler plug-in to Xcode. The mapping works as follows:

* Database tables are mapped to classes.
* Database columns are mapped to class attributes.
* Database rows are mapped to objects (or class instances).

You can build data models based on existing data sources or you can build data models from scratch, which you then use to create data structures (tables, columns, joins) in a data source. The result is that database records can be transposed into Java objects.

The advantage of using data models is that applications are isolated from the idiosyncrasies of the data sources they access. This separation of an application&#x27;s business logic from database logic allows developers to change the database an application accesses without needing to change the application.

EOF provides a level of database transparency not seen in other tools and allows the same model to be used to access different vendor databases and even allows relationships across different vendor databases without changing source code. 

Its power comes from exposing the underlying data sources as managed graphs of persistent objects. In simple terms, this means that it organizes the application&#x27;s model layer into a set of defined in-memory data objects. It then tracks changes to these objects and can reverse those changes on demand, such as when a user performs an undo command. Then, when it is time to save changes to the application&#x27;s data, it archives the objects to the underlying data sources.

===Using Inheritance===

In designing Enterprise Objects developers can leverage the object-oriented feature known as inheritance. A Customer object and an Employee object, for example, might both inherit certain characteristics from a more generic Person object, such as name, address, and phone number. While this kind of thinking is inherent in object-oriented design, relational databases have no explicit support for inheritance. However, using Enterprise Objects, you can build data models that reflect object hierarchies. That is, you can design database tables to support inheritance by also designing enterprise objects that map to multiple tables or particular views of a database table.

==Enterprise Objects (EOs) ==

An Enterprise Object is analogous to what is often known in object-oriented programming as a business object — a class which models a physical or conceptual object in the business domain (e.g. a customer, an order, an item, etc.). What makes an EO different from other objects is that its instance data maps to a data store. Typically, an enterprise object contains key-value pairs that represent a row in a relational database. The key is basically the column name, and the value is what was in that row in the database. So it can be said that an EO&#x27;s properties persist beyond the life of any particular running application.

More precisely, an Enterprise Object is an instance of a class that implements the com.webobjects.eocontrol.EOEnterpriseObject interface.

An Enterprise Object has a corresponding model (called an EOModel) that defines the mapping between the class&#x27;s object model and the database schema. However, an enterprise object doesn&#x27;t explicitly know about its model. This level of abstraction means that database vendors can be switched without it affecting the developer&#x27;s code. This gives Enterprise Objects a high degree of reusability.

== EOF and Core Data ==

Despite their common origins, the two technologies diverged, with each technology retaining a subset of the features of the original Objective-C code base, while adding some new features.

=== Features Supported Only by EOF ===

EOF supports custom SQL; shared editing contexts; nested editing contexts; and pre-fetching and batch faulting of relationships, all features of the original Objective-C implementation not supported by Core Data. Core Data also does not provide the equivalent of an EOModelGroup—the NSManagedObjectModel class provides methods for merging models from existing models, and for retrieving merged models from bundles.

=== Features Supported Only by Core Data ===

Core Data supports fetched properties; multiple configurations within a managed object model; local stores; and store aggregation (the data for a given entity may be spread across multiple stores); customization and localization of property names and validation warnings; and the use of predicates for property validation. These features of the original Objective-C implementation are not supported by the Java implementation.

<text>Judicial independence is the concept that the judiciary should be independent from the other branches of government. That is, courts should not be subject to improper influence from the other branches of government or from private or partisan interests. Judicial independence is important for the idea of separation of powers.

Different countries deal with the idea of judicial independence through different means of judicial selection, or choosing judges. One method seen as promoting judicial independence is by granting life tenure or long tenure for judges, as it would ideally free them to decide cases and make rulings according to the rule of law and judicial discretion, even if those decisions are politically unpopular or opposed by powerful interests. This concept can be traced back to 18th-century England.

In some countries, the ability of the judiciary to check the legislature is enhanced by the power of judicial review. This power can be used, for example, by mandating certain action when the judiciary perceives that a branch of government is refusing to perform a constitutional duty or by declaring laws passed by the legislature unconstitutional. Other countries limit judicial independence by parliamentary sovereignty.

==Advantages==
Judicial independence serves as a safeguard for rights and privileges from a limited government and prevents executive and legislative encroachment upon those rights. It serves as a foundation for the rule of law and democracy. The rule of law means that all authority and power must come from an ultimate source of law. Under an independent judicial system, the courts and its officers are free from inappropriate intervention in the judiciary&#x27;s affairs. With this independence, the judiciary can safeguard people&#x27;s rights and freedoms which ensure equal protection for all.

The effectiveness of the law and the respect that people have for the law and the government which enacts it is dependent upon the judiciary&#x27;s independence to mete out fair decisions. Furthermore, it is a pillar of economic growth as multinational businesses and investors have confidence to invest in the economy of a nation who has a strong and stable judiciary that is independent of interference. The judiciary&#x27;s role in deciding the validity of presidential and parliamentary elections also necessitates independence of the judiciary.

===Economic ===
Constitutional economics studies issues such as the proper distribution of national wealth including government spending on the judiciary. In transitional and developing countries, spending on the judiciary may be controlled by the executive. This undermines the principle of judicial independence because it creates a financial dependence of the judiciary on the executive. It is important to distinguish between two methods of corruption of the judiciary: the state (through budget planning and privileges) being the most dangerous, and private. State corruption of the judiciary can impede the ability of businesses to optimally facilitate the growth and development of a market economy.

In some countries, the constitution also prohibits the legislative branch from reducing salaries of sitting judges.

==Criticism==
The disadvantages of having a judiciary that is seemingly too independent include possible abuse of power by judges. Self-interest, ideological dedication and even corruption may influence the decisions of judges without any checks and balances in place to prevent this abuse of power if the judiciary is completely independent. The relationship between the judiciary and the executive is a complex series of dependencies and inter-dependencies which counter-check each other and must be carefully balanced. One can be too independent of the other. Furthermore, judicial support of the executive is not as negative as it seems as the executive is the branch of government with the greatest claim to democratic legitimacy. Roger K. Warren writes that if the judiciary and executive are constantly feuding, no government can function well.

An extremely independent judiciary would also lack judicial accountability, which is the duty of a public decision-maker to explain and justify a decision and to make amendments where a decision causes injustice or problems. Judges are not required to give an entire account of their rationale behind decisions, and are shielded against public scrutiny and protected from legal repercussions. However judicial accountability can reinforce judicial independence as it could show that judges have proper reasons and rationales for arriving at a particular decision. Warren opines that while unelected judges are not democratically accountable to the people, the key is for judges to achieve equilibrium between accountability and independence to ensure that justice is upheld. Judicial supremacy could potentially promote an elitist autocracy, but this can be balanced through democracy. Judges are elected in some jurisdictions.

==Development==
The development of judicial independence has been argued to involve a cycle of national law having an impact on international law, and international law subsequently impacting national law. This is said to occur in three phases: the first phase is characterized by the domestic development of the concept of judicial independence, the second by the spread of these concepts internationally and their implementation in international law, and the third by the implementation in national law of these newly formulated international principles of judicial independence.

A notable example illustrating this cycle is the United Kingdom. The first phase occurred in England with the original conception of judicial independence in the Act of Settlement 1701. The second phase was evident when England&#x27;s concepts regarding judicial independence spread internationally, and were adopted into the domestic law of other countries; for instance, England served as the model for Montesquieu&#x27;s separation of powers doctrine, and the Founding Fathers of the US Constitution used England as their dominant model in formulating the Constitution&#x27;s Article III, which is the foundation of American judicial independence. Other common law countries, including Canada, Australia, and India, also adopted the British model of judicial independence.

In recent decades the third phase of judicial independence has been evident in the UK, as it has been significantly influenced by judicial independence principles developed by international human rights constitutional documents. The European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) has had a significant impact on the conceptual analysis of judicial independence in England and Scotland. This process began in the 1990s with the ECtHR hearing UK cases and, more significantly, in the application of the European Convention on Human Rights in British law through the Human Rights Act 1998, which came into force in the UK in 2000.

Where British national law had previously impacted the international development of judicial independence, the British Constitutional Reform Act 2005 marked a shift, with international law now impacting British domestic law. The Constitutional Reform Act dramatically reformed government control over the administration of justice in England and Wales; importantly, it discontinued the position of the Lord Chancellor, one of the country&#x27;s oldest constitutional offices, who was entrusted with a combination of legislative, executive, and judicial capacities. The Lord Chancellor served as speaker of the Upper House of Parliament, the House of Lords; as a member of the executive branch and member of the senior cabinet; and as the head of the judiciary. Historically, the appellate function had a connection with the executive branch due to the types of cases typically heard – impeachment and the hearing of felony charges against peers. The Constitutional Reform Act established new lines of demarcation between the Lord Chancellor and the judiciary, transferring all the judicial functions to the judiciary and entrusting the Lord Chancellor only with what are considered administrative and executive matters. In addition, the Constitutional Reform Act replaced the Lord Chancellor by the Lord Chief Justice as head of the judiciary, separated the judicial Appellate Committee of the House of Lords from the legislative parliament, reforming it as the Supreme Court, and creating a Judicial Appointments Commission. The creation of the Supreme Court was important, for it finally separated the highest court of appeal from the House of Lords.

Thus, the United Kingdom, where judicial independence began over three hundred years ago, illustrates the interaction over time of national and international law and jurisprudence in the area of judicial independence. In this process, concepts and ideas have become enriched as they have been implemented in successive judicial and political systems, as each system has enhanced and deepened the concepts and ideas it actualized. In addition to the UK, similar developments of conceptual cross-fertilization can be seen internationally, for example in European Union law, in civil law countries such as Austria, and in other common law jurisdictions including Canada.

In recent years, the principle of judicial independence has been described as one of the core values of the justice system.

==International standards==
The International Association of Judicial Independence and World Peace produced the Mt. Scopus International Standards of Judicial Independence between 2007 and 2012. These built on the same association&#x27;s New Delhi Minimum Standards on Judicial independence adopted in 1982 and their Montréal Universal Declaration on the Independence of Justice in 1983. Other influences they cite for the standards include the UN Basic Principles of Judicial Independence from 1985, the Burgh House Principles of Judicial Independence in International Law (for the international judiciary), Tokyo Law Asia Principles, Council of Europe Statements on judicial independence (particularly the Recommendation of the Committee of Ministers to Member States on the independence, efficiency and role of judges), the Bangalore Principles of Judicial Conduct 2002, and the American Bar Association&#x27;s revision of its ethical standards for judges.

== Judicial independence metrics ==
Judicial independence metrics allow a quantitative analysis of judicial independence for individual countries. One judicial independence metric is the high court independence index in the V-Dem Dataset, where higher values indicate higher independence, shown below for individual countries.
== Judicial independence by country ==
=== Australia ===

There was a struggle to establish judicial independence in colonial Australia, but by 1901 it was entrenched in the Australian constitution, including the separation of judicial power such that the High Court of Australia held in 2004 that all courts capable of exercising federal judicial power must be, and must appear to be, independent and impartial. Writing in 2007 Chief Justice of Australia Murray Gleeson stated that Australians largely took judicial independence for granted and the details were not matters of wide interest. No federal judge and only one supreme court judge has been removed for misconduct since 1901. Immunity from suit for judicial acts, security of tenure, and fixed remuneration are all established parts of judicial independence in Australia. The appointment of judges remains exclusively at the discretion of the executive which gives rise to concerns expressed that judicial appointments are political and made for political gain. Issues continue to arise in relation to dealing with judicial misconduct not warranting removal and incapacity of judges. In 2013 Chief Justice of NSW Tom Bathurst identified the way in which judicial and court performance was measured as one of the most substantial risks to the separation of powers in Australia.

===Canada ===
Canada has a level of judicial independence entrenched in its Constitution, awarding superior court justices various guarantees to independence under sections 96 to 100 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;. These include rights to tenure (although the Constitution has since been amended to introduce mandatory retirement at age 75) and the right to a salary determined by the Parliament of Canada (as opposed to the executive). In 1982 a measure of judicial independence was extended to inferior courts specializing in criminal law (but not civil law) by section 11 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, although in the 1986 case &quot;Valente v. The Queen&quot; it was found these rights are limited. They do, however, involve tenure, financial security and some administrative control.

The year 1997 saw a major shift towards judicial independence, as the Supreme Court of Canada in the Provincial Judges Reference found an unwritten constitutional norm guaranteeing judicial independence to all judges, including civil law inferior court judges. The unwritten norm is said to be implied by the preamble to the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;. Consequently, judicial compensation committees such as the Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission now recommend judicial salaries in Canada.
There are two types of judicial independence: institutional independence and decisional independence. Institutional independence means the judicial branch is independent from the executive and legislative branches. Decisional independence is the idea that judges should be able to decide cases solely based on the law and facts, without letting the media, politics or other concerns sway their decisions, and without fearing penalty in their careers for their decisions.

=== Hong Kong ===
In Hong Kong, independence of the judiciary has been the tradition since the territory became a British crown colony in 1842. After the 1997 transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong to the People&#x27;s Republic of China pursuant to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, an international treaty registered with the United Nations, independence of the judiciary, along with continuation of English common law, has been enshrined in the territory&#x27;s constitutional document, the Basic Law.

=== Singapore ===

Judicial independence in Singapore is protected by the Constitution of Singapore, statutes such as the State Courts Act and Supreme Court of Judicature Act, and the common law. To safeguard judicial independence, Singapore law lays down special procedures to be followed before the conduct of Supreme Court judges may be discussed in Parliament and for their removal from office for misconduct, and provides that their remuneration may not be reduced during their tenure. By statute, judicial officers of the State Courts, and the Registrar, Deputy Registrar and assistant registrars of the Supreme Court have immunity from civil suits, and are prohibited from hearing and deciding cases in which they are personally interested. The common law provides similar protections and disabilities for Supreme Court judges.

The Chief Justice and other Supreme Court judges are appointed by the President of Singapore acting on the advice of the Cabinet of Singapore. The President must consult the Chief Justice when appointing other judges, and may exercise personal discretion to refuse to make an appointment if he does not concur with the Cabinet&#x27;s advice. Supreme Court justices enjoy security of tenure up to the age of 65 years, after which they cease to hold office. However, the Constitution permits such judges to be re-appointed on a term basis.

===England and Wales===

====History====

During the Middle Ages, under the Norman monarchy of the Kingdom of England, the king and his Curia Regis held judicial power. Judicial independence began to emerge during the early modern period; more courts were created and a judicial profession grew. By the fifteenth century, the king&#x27;s role in this feature of government became small. Nevertheless, kings could still influence courts and dismiss judges. The Stuart dynasty used this power frequently in order to overpower the Parliament of England. After the Stuarts were removed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688, some advocated guarding against royal manipulation of the judiciary. King William III approved the Act of Settlement 1701, which established tenure for judges unless Parliament removed them.

=====Contemporary usage=====
Under the uncodified British Constitution, there are two important conventions which help to preserve judicial independence. The first is that the Parliament of the United Kingdom does not comment on the cases which are before the court. The second is the principle of parliamentary privilege: that Members of Parliament are protected from prosecution in certain circumstances by the courts.

Furthermore, the independence of the judiciary is guaranteed by the Constitutional Reform Act 2005. In order to try to promote the independence of the judiciary, the selection process is designed to minimize political interference. The process focuses on senior members of the judiciary rather than on politicians. Part 2 of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 aims to increase diversity among the judiciary.

The pay of judges is determined by an independent pay review body. It makes recommendations to the government after taking evidence from a variety of sources. The government accepts these recommendations and will traditionally implement them fully. As long as judges hold their positions in &quot;good order&quot;, they remain in post until they wish to retire or until they reach the mandatory retirement age of 70.

Until 1 January 2010, the legal profession was self-regulating; with responsibility for implementing and enforcing its own professional standards and disciplining its own members. The bodies which performed this function were the Bar Council and the Law Society. However, this self-regulation came to an end when approved regulators came under the regulation of the Legal Services Board, composed of non-lawyers, following the passage of the Legal Services Act 2007. This saw the establishment of the Solicitors Regulation Authority to regulate solicitors and the Bar Standards Board to regulate barristers.

===United States===
====Federal courts====
Article III of the United States Constitution establishes the federal courts as part of the federal government.

The Constitution provides that federal judges, including judges of the Supreme Court of the United States, are appointed by the President &quot;by and with the advice and consent of the Senate&quot;. Once appointed, federal judges:

Federal judges vacate office only upon death, resignation, or impeachment and removal from office by Congress; only 13 federal judges have ever been impeached. The phrase &quot;during good behavior&quot; predates the Declaration of Independence. John Adams equated it with &quot;&quot; in a letter to the Boston Gazette published on 11 January 1773, a phrase that first appeared in section 3 of the Act of Settlement 1701 in England.

The President is free to appoint any person to the federal bench, yet typically he consults with the American Bar Association, whose Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rates each nominee &quot;Well Qualified&quot;, &quot;Qualified&quot; or &quot;Not Qualified&quot;.

====State courts====
State courts deal with independence of the judiciary in many ways, and several forms of judicial selection are used for both trial courts and appellate courts (including state supreme courts), varying between states and sometimes within states. In some states, judges are elected (sometime on a partisan ballot, other times on a nonpartisan one), while in others they are appointed by the governor or state legislature.

The 2000 case of &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot;, in which a majority of the Supreme Court, including some appointees of President George H. W. Bush, overruled challenges to the election of George W. Bush then pending in the Florida Supreme Court, whose members had all been appointed by Democratic governors, is seen by many as reinforcing the need for judicial independence, both with regard to the Florida Supreme Court and the US Supreme Court. This case has increased focus and attention on judicial outcomes as opposed to the traditional focus on judicial qualifications.

<text>The judiciary (also known as the judicial system, judicature, judicial branch, judiciative branch, and court or judiciary system) is the system of courts that adjudicates legal disputes/disagreements and interprets, defends, and applies the law in legal cases.

== Meaning ==
The judiciary is the system of courts that interprets, defends, and applies the law in the name of the state. The judiciary can also be thought of as the mechanism for the resolution of disputes. Under the doctrine of the separation of powers, the judiciary generally does not make statutory law (which is the responsibility of the legislature) or enforce law (which is the responsibility of the executive), but rather interprets, defends, and applies the law to the facts of each case. However, in some countries the judiciary does make common law.

In many jurisdictions the judicial branch has the power to change laws through the process of judicial review. Courts with judicial review power may annul the laws and rules of the state when it finds them incompatible with a higher norm, such as primary legislation, the provisions of the constitution, treaties or international law. Judges constitute a critical force for interpretation and implementation of a constitution, thus in common law countries creating the body of constitutional law.

== History ==
This is a more general overview of the development of the judiciary and judicial systems over the course of history.

=== Roman judiciary ===
==== Archaic Roman Law (650–264 BC) ====
The most important part was &quot;Ius Civile&quot; (Latin for &quot;civil law&quot;). This consisted of &quot;Mos Maiorum&quot; (Latin for &quot;way of the ancestors&quot;) and &quot;Leges&quot; (Latin for &quot;laws&quot;). &quot;Mos Maiorum&quot; was a set of rules of conduct based on social norms created over the years by predecessors. In 451–449 BC, the &quot;Mos Maiorum&quot; was written down in the Twelve Tables. &quot;L&#x27; were rules set by the leaders, first the kings, later the popular assembly during the Republic. In these early years, the legal process consisted of two phases. The first phase, &quot;In Iure&quot;, was the judicial process. One would go to the head of the judicial system (at first the priests as law was part of religion) who would look at the applicable rules to the case. Parties in the case could be assisted by jurists. Then the second phase would start, the &quot;Apud Iudicem&quot;. The case would be put before the judges, which were normal Roman citizens in an uneven number. No experience was required as the applicable rules were already selected. They would merely have to judge the case.

==== Pre-classical Roman Law (264–27 BC) ====
The most important change in this period was the shift from priest to praetor as the head of the judicial system. The praetor would also make an edict in which he would declare new laws or principles for the year he was elected. This edict is also known as praetorian law.

==== Principate (27 BC – 284 AD) ====
The Principate is the first part of the Roman Empire, which started with the reign of Augustus. This time period is also known as the &quot;classical era of Roman Law&quot; In this era, the praetor&#x27;s edict was now known as &quot;edictum perpetuum&quot; which were all the edicts collected in one edict by Hadrian. Also, a new judicial process came up: &quot;cognitio extraordinaria&quot; (Latin for &quot;extraordinary process&quot;). This came into being due to the largess of the empire. This process only had one phase, where the case was presented to a professional judge who was a representative of the emperor. Appeal was possible to the immediate superior.

During this time period, legal experts started to come up. They studied the law and were advisors to the emperor. They also were allowed to give legal advice on behalf of the emperor.

==== Dominate (284–565 AD) ====
This era is also known as the &quot;post-classical era of Roman law&quot;. The most important legal event during this era was the Codification by Justinianus: the Corpus Iuris Civilis. This contained all Roman Law. It was both a collection of the work of the legal experts and commentary on it, and a collection of new laws. The &quot;Corpus Iuris Civilis&quot; consisted of four parts:

# &quot;Institutiones&quot;: This was an introduction and a summary of Roman law.
# &quot;Digesta/Pandectae&quot;: This was the collection of the edicts.
# &quot;Codex&quot;: This contained all the laws of the emperors.
# &quot;Novellae&quot;: This contained all new laws created.

=== Middle Ages ===
During the late Middle Ages, education started to grow. First education was limited to the monasteries and abbeys, but expanded to cathedrals and schools in the city in the 11th century, eventually creating universities. The universities had five faculties: arts, medicine, theology, canon law and &quot;Ius Civile&quot;, or civil law. Canon law, or ecclesiastical law are laws created by the Pope, head of the Roman Catholic Church. The last form was also called secular law, or Roman law. It was mainly based on the &quot;Corpus Iuris Civilis,&quot; which had been rediscovered in 1070. Roman law was mainly used for &quot;worldly&quot; affairs, while canon law was used for questions related to the church.

The period starting in the 11th century with the discovery of the &quot;Corpus Iuris Civilis&quot; is also called the Scholastics, which can be divided in the early and late scholastics. It is characterised with the renewed interest in the old texts.

==== &quot;Ius Civile&quot; ====
===== Early scholastics (1070–1263) =====
The rediscovery of the Digesta from the &quot;Corpus Iuris Civilis&quot; led the university of Bologna to start teaching Roman law. Professors at the university were asked to research the Roman laws and advise the Emperor and the Pope with regards to the old laws. This led to the Glossators to start translating and recreating the &quot;Corpus Iuris Civilis&quot; and create literature around it:
* &quot;Glossae&quot;: translations of the old Roman laws
* &quot;Summae&quot;: summaries
* &quot;Brocardica&quot;: short sentences that made the old laws easier to remember, a sort of mnemonic
* &quot;Quaestio Disputata&quot; (&quot;sic et non&quot;): a dialectic method of seeking the argument and refute it.

Accursius wrote the &quot;Glossa Ordinaria&quot; in 1263, ending the early scholastics.

===== Late scholastics (1263–1453) =====
The successors of the Glossators were the Post-Glossators or Commentators. They looked at a subject in a logical and systematic way by writing comments with the texts, treatises and &quot;consilia&quot;, which are advises given according to the old Roman law.

==== Canon Law ====
===== Early Scholastics (1070–1234) =====
Canon law knows a few forms of laws: the &quot;canones&quot;, decisions made by Councils, and the &quot;decreta&quot;, decisions made by the Popes. The monk Gratian, one of the well-known decretists, started to organise all of the church law, which is now known as the , or simply as &quot;Decretum&quot;. It forms the first part of the collection of six legal texts, which together became known as the &quot;Corpus Juris Canonici&quot;. It was used by canonists of the Roman Catholic Church until Pentecost (19 May) 1918, when a revised &quot;Code of Canon Law&quot; (&quot;Codex Iuris Canonici&quot;) promulgated by Pope Benedict XV on 27 May 1917 obtained legal force.

===== Late Scholastics (1234–1453) =====
The Decretalists, like the post-glossators for &quot;Ius Civile&quot;, started to write treatises, comments and advises with the texts.

==== Ius Commune ====
Around the 15th century, a process of reception and acculturation started with both laws. The final product was known as &quot;Ius Commune&quot;. It was a combination of canon law, which represented the common norms and principles, and Roman law, which were the actual rules and terms. It meant the creation of more legal texts and books and a more systematic way of going through the legal process. In the new legal process, appeal was possible. The process would be partially inquisitorial, where the judge would actively investigate all the evidence before him, but also partially adversarial, where both parties are responsible for finding the evidence to convince the judge.
After the French Revolution, lawmakers stopped interpretation of law by judges, and the legislature was the only body permitted to interpret the law; this prohibition was later overturned by the Napoleonic Code.

==Functions of the judiciary in different law systems==
In common law jurisdictions, courts interpret law; this includes constitutions, statutes, and regulations. They also make law (but in a limited sense, limited to the facts of particular cases) based upon prior case law in areas where the legislature has not made law. For instance, the tort of negligence is not derived from statute law in most common law jurisdictions. The term &quot;common law&quot; refers to this kind of law. Common law decisions set precedent for all courts to follow. This is sometimes called &quot;stare decisis&quot;.

===Country-specific functions===
In the United States court system, the Supreme Court is the final authority on the interpretation of the federal Constitution and all statutes and regulations created pursuant to it, as well as the constitutionality of the various state laws; in the US federal court system, federal cases are tried in trial courts, known as the US district courts, followed by appellate courts and then the Supreme Court. State courts, which try 98% of litigation, may have different names and organization; trial courts may be called &quot;courts of common plea&quot;, appellate courts &quot;superior courts&quot; or &quot;commonwealth courts&quot;. The judicial system, whether state or federal, begins with a court of first instance, is appealed to an appellate court, and then ends at the court of last resort.

In France, the final authority on the interpretation of the law is the Council of State for administrative cases, and the Court of Cassation for civil and criminal cases.

In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the final authority on the interpretation of the law is the National People&#x27;s Congress.

Other countries such as Argentina have mixed systems that include lower courts, appeals courts, a cassation court (for criminal law) and a Supreme Court. In this system the Supreme Court is always the final authority, but criminal cases have four stages, one more than civil law does. On the court sits a total of nine justices. This number has been changed several times.

==Judicial systems by country==

=== Japan ===
Japan&#x27;s process for selecting judges is longer and more stringent than in various countries, like the United States and in Mexico. Assistant judges are appointed from those who have completed their training at the Legal Training and Research Institute located in Wako. Once appointed, assistant judges still may not qualify to sit alone until they have served for five years, and have been appointed by the Supreme Court of Japan. Judges require ten years of experience in practical affairs, as a public prosecutor or practicing attorney. In the Japanese judicial branch there is the Supreme Court, eight high courts, fifty district courts, fifty family courts, and 438 summary courts.

=== Mexico ===
Justices of the Mexican Supreme Court are appointed by the President of Mexico, and then are approved by the Mexican Senate to serve for a fifteen-year term. Other justices are appointed by the Supreme Court and serve for six years. Federal courts consist of the 11 ministers of the Supreme Court, 32 circuit tribunals and 98 district courts. The Supreme Court of Mexico is located in Mexico City. Supreme Court Judges must be of ages 35 to 65 and hold a law degree during the five years preceding their nomination.

=== United States ===
 
United States Supreme Court justices are appointed by the President of the United States and approved by the United States Senate. The Supreme Court justices serve for life term or until retirement. The Supreme Court is located in Washington, D.C. The United States federal court system consists of 94 federal judicial districts. The 94 districts are then divided up into twelve regional circuits. The United States has five different types of courts that are considered subordinate to the Supreme Court: United States bankruptcy courts, United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, United States Court of International Trade, United States courts of appeals, and United States district courts.

Immigration courts are not part of the judicial branch; immigration judges are employees of the Executive Office for Immigration Review, part of the United States Department of Justice in the executive branch.

Each state, district and inhabited territory also has its own court system operating within the legal framework of the respective jurisdiction, responsible for hearing cases regarding state and territorial law. All these jurisdictions also have their own supreme courts (or equivalent) which serve as the highest courts of law within their respective jurisdictions.

<text>In knot theory, a figure-eight knot (also called Listing&#x27;s knot) is the unique knot with a crossing number of four. This makes it the knot with the third-smallest possible crossing number, after the unknot and the
trefoil knot. The figure-eight knot is a prime knot.

== Origin of name ==
The name is given because tying a normal figure-eight knot in a rope and then joining the ends together, in the most natural way, gives a model of the mathematical knot.

== Description ==

A simple parametric representation of the figure-eight knot is as the set of all points (&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;) where

:formula_1

for &quot;t&quot; varying over the real numbers (see 2D visual realization at bottom right).

The figure-eight knot is prime, alternating, rational with an associated value
of 5/3, and is achiral. The figure-eight knot is also a fibered knot. This follows from other, less simple (but very interesting) representations of the knot: 

(1) It is a &quot;homogeneous&quot; closed braid (namely, the closure of the 3-string braid σ1σ2−1σ1σ2−1), and a theorem of John Stallings shows that any closed homogeneous braid is fibered. 

(2) It is the link at (0,0,0,0) of an isolated critical point of a real-polynomial map F: R4→R2, so (according to a theorem of John Milnor) the Milnor map of F is actually a fibration. Bernard Perron found the first such F for this knot, namely,

: formula_2

where

: formula_3

== Mathematical properties ==

The figure-eight knot has played an important role historically (and continues to do so) in the theory of 3-manifolds. Sometime in the mid-to-late 1970s, William Thurston showed that the figure-eight was hyperbolic, by decomposing its complement into two ideal hyperbolic tetrahedra. (Robert Riley and Troels Jørgensen, working independently of each other, had earlier shown that the figure-eight knot was hyperbolic by other means.) This construction, new at the time, led him to many powerful results and methods. For example, he was able to show that all but ten Dehn surgeries on the figure-eight knot resulted in non-Haken, non-Seifert-fibered irreducible 3-manifolds; these were the first such examples. Many more have been discovered by generalizing Thurston&#x27;s construction to other knots and links.

The figure-eight knot is also the hyperbolic knot whose complement has the smallest possible volume, formula_4 , where formula_5 is the Lobachevsky function. From this perspective, the figure-eight knot can be considered the simplest hyperbolic knot. The figure eight knot complement is a double-cover of the Gieseking manifold, which has the smallest volume among non-compact hyperbolic 3-manifolds.

The figure-eight knot and the (−2,3,7) pretzel knot are the only two hyperbolic knots known to have more than 6 &quot;exceptional surgeries&quot;, Dehn surgeries resulting in a non-hyperbolic 3-manifold; they have 10 and 7, respectively. A theorem of Lackenby and Meyerhoff, whose proof relies on the geometrization conjecture and computer assistance, holds that 10 is the largest possible number of exceptional surgeries of any hyperbolic knot. However, it is not currently known whether the figure-eight knot is the only one that achieves the bound of 10. A well-known conjecture is that the bound (except for the two knots mentioned) is 6.
The figure-eight knot has genus 1 and is fibered. 
Therefore its complement fibers over the circle, the fibers being Seifert surfaces which are 2-dimensional tori with one boundary component. 
The monodromy map is then a homeomorphism of the 2-torus, which can be represented in this case by the matrix formula_6.

==Invariants==
The Alexander polynomial of the figure-eight knot is
:formula_7
the Conway polynomial is
:formula_8
and the Jones polynomial is
:formula_9
The symmetry between formula_10 and formula_11 in the Jones polynomial reflects the fact that the figure-eight knot is achiral.

<text>Lake Zurich (; ) is a lake in Switzerland, extending southeast of the city of Zurich. Depending on the context, Lake Zurich or can be used to describe the lake as a whole, or just that part of the lake downstream of the Hurden peninsula and Seedamm causeway (between Pfäffikon and Rapperswil). In the latter case, the upstream part of the lake is called &quot;Obersee&quot; (), whilst the lower part is sometimes also referred to as the Lower Lake (), respectively.

== Geography ==
Lake Zurich is a glacial lake that was formed by the . Its main tributary is the River Linth, which rises in the glaciers of the Glarus Alps. The Linth originally flew directly into Lake Zurich, but was later diverted by the Escher canal (completed in 1811) into Lake Walen () from where its waters are now carried to the east end of Lake Zurich (near Schmerikon) by means of the straightened Linth canal (completed in 1816). Until the early 16th century, there was another lake upstream of &quot;Obersee&quot;, Lake Tuggen () near Tuggen. The waters of Lake Zurich flow out of the lake at its north-west end (at the level of the Quaibrücke), passing through the city of Zurich; however, the outflow is then called the Limmat. The Limmat is a tributary of the Aare, which itself is a tributary of the High Rhine. The culminating point of the lake&#x27;s drainage basin is the Tödi at 3,614 metres above sea level.

Besides the River Linth, other tributaries are the Jona, Schmerikoner Aa, Steinenbach and Wägitaler Aa, which all flow out into &quot;Obersee&quot;, along with several creeks. The Seedamm, an artificial causeway and bridge, crosses the narrowest point of the lake at the level of the Hurden Peninsula, carrying a railway line and road from Rapperswil to Pfäffikon. The waterway is also crossed by the &quot;Holzbrücke Rapperswil-Hurden&quot;, a wooden pedestrian bridge. The eastern section of the lake is known as the &quot;Obersee&quot; (). West of the Seedamm lie the small islands of Lützelau and Ufenau, where in 1523 Ulrich von Hutten took refuge and died. Other islands include Grosser Hafner, Saffa Island and Schönenwerd (near Richterswil). A popular tourist destination is the Au peninsula at the village of Au between Wädenswil and Horgen. The lake shores are well cultivated and fertile. They include nature reserves, such as Frauenwinkel or Bätzimatt. The bay of Rapperswil and reed in Nuolen are wintering areas for birds and popular sites for bird watching.

To the east, separated by Zürichberg-Adlisberg, Forch, and Pfannenstiel, are two smaller lakes, Greifensee () and Pfäffikersee (). There are several minor lakes and ponds in the vicinity, such as Egelsee, Lützelsee or Türlersee. Zimmerberg, Etzel and Buechberg mountains lie to the west and south of the lake, respectively. Further to the east, the Speer, Chüemettler and Federispitz can be seen from the southern part of the lake.

Administratively, Lake Zurich is split between the cantons of Zurich (Horgen District), St. Gallen (See-Gaster) and Schwyz (Höfe and March districts). The lower lake, to the west of the Seedamm, is largely in the canton of Zurich, whilst the upper lake is shared between the cantons of St. Gallen and Schwyz.

===Tributaries of lower lake===
The following rivers or streams flow into lower part of Lake Zurich. From the Limmat clockwise, they are:

*Hornbach (at Zürichhorn)
*Düggelbach (at Zollikon)
*Kusenbach (at Küsnacht)
*Küsnachter Dorfbach (at Hornelanpark, Küsnacht)
*Heslibach (at Erlenbach)
*Dorfbach Erlenbach (at Erlenbach)
*Tobelbächli (at Erlenbach)
*Schipfbach (at Erlenbach)
*Rossbach (at Herrliberg)
*Meilener Dorfbach (at Meilen)
*Beugenbach (at Meilen)
*Aebletenbach (at Ländeli, Meilen)
*Uetiker Mulibach (at Meilen)
*Feldbach (at Horn)
*Sarenbach (at Freienbach)
*Krebsbach (at Bäch, Freienbach)
*Mülibach (at Richterswil)
*Zürichsee (at Wädenswil)
*Meilibach (at Wädenswil)
*Schanzengraben (Zurich)

==Coastal settlements==
Zurich, at the north-western end of the lake, is the largest city on Lake Zurich. The least populous is Hurden.

On the west shore (which gradually becomes the south shore) are Kilchberg, Rüschlikon, Thalwil, Oberrieden, Horgen, Au, Wädenswil and Richterswil in the canton of Zurich, and Freienbach, Pfäffikon, Hurden, Altendorf, Lachen, Nuolen and Tuggen in the canton of Schwyz.

On the opposite shore, which gradually becomes the northern shore towards east, are Zollikon, Küsnacht, Erlenbach, Herrliberg, Feldmeilen, Meilen, Stäfa, and Feldbach in the canton of Zurich, and Rapperswil-Jona. The latter includes the medieval town of Rapperswil, whose castle is home to the Polish museum, and the coastal villages of Kempraten, Busskirch and Bollingen. The municipalities of Rapperswil-Jona and Schmerikon, which is close to the east end of the lake, are both in the canton of St. Gallen. A little further east is the larger town of Uznach.

===Prehistoric pile dwellings and historic settlements===
Nine Prehistoric pile dwellings around Zürichsee, which are located in the cantons of Schwyz, St. Gallen and Zurich, are among the 56 Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps in Switzerland.

These nine sites on the Lake Zurich lakeshore are Freienbach–Hurden Rosshorn, Freienbach–Hurden Seefeld, Rapperswil-Jona/Hombrechtikon–Feldbach, Rapperswil-Jona–Technikum, Erlenbach–Winkel, Meilen–Rorenhaab, Wädenswil–Vorder Au, Zurich–Enge Alpenquai, and Kleiner Hafner. Because the lake has grown in size over time, the original piles are now around to under the water level of . Two other sites are not far away: Greifensee–Storen/Wildsberg at the Greifensee and Wetzikon–Robenhausen at the Pfäffikersee.

As well as being part of the 56 Swiss sites of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, each of these 11 prehistoric pile dwellings is also listed as a &quot;Class object&quot; in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance.

In Kempraten (Rapperswil-Jona municipality), there was a Roman vicus named Centum Prata. Another settlement was Turicum in Zurich.

==Transportation==
The main transportation nodes around the lake are Zurich and — given the presence of the Seedamm causeway — Pfäffikon and Rapperswil. Besides Quaibrücke in Zurich and the Seedamm, there are no bridges across the lake. In addition, the towns of Meilen and Horgen are connected by a car ferry.

===Trams and buses===
Bus routes on the western shore are operated by Zimmerberg Bus. On the eastern side, the VZO provides bus services along the lake shore and to the Zürcher Oberland. VZO also operates the urban bus routes in Rapperswil and Jona. At the northern end of the lake, in Zurich, public transport consists of trams, trolleybuses and busses of VBZ.

===Rail===
Left bank: The towns on the western and southern shores of Lake Zurich are linked by the Lake Zurich left bank railway line, which connects with . This line is served by the , , and of the Zurich S-Bahn and InterRegio (IR) trains. It is also used by EuroCity (EC), Intercity Express (ICE), Intercity (IC) and Railjet (RJX) trains but they do not call at stations along the lake. At , the line connects to the Wädenswil–Einsiedeln railway to Einsiedeln, served by the .

Right bank: Towns on the eastern shore of the lower lake (also known as the Goldcoast, or ) are connected by the Lake Zurich right bank railway line between Zürich HB and . This line is served by S-Bahn services , , and of Zurich S-Bahn.

The Rapperswil–Ziegelbrücke railway line along the northern shore of Obersee is served by St. Gallen S-Bahn services , and , and the &quot;Voralpen Express&quot;. This line connects Rapperswil with on the eastern end of the lake via . is a ghost station since 2004.

Seedamm: The Rapperswil–Pfäffikon railway line across the Seedamm and Hurden Peninsula is served by Zurich S-Bahn services and and the Voralpen Express. This short line connects Rapperswil with via .

===Shipping===
The Zürichsee-Schifffahrtsgesellschaft – – provides with its 17-passenger ships touristic services on Lake Zurich. There are a number of passenger ferry services, notably the Horgen–Meilen ferry, an auto ferry between Horgen and Meilen.

==Freeze over==

The freezing of Lake Zurich, called &quot;Seegfrörni&quot; in Swiss German, is a rare and spectacular event. The lake was frozen in the following Common Era/Anno Domini years (1963 was the last time). Years 1223 to 1963 are based on (see list at the end of the article) and, for 1435 see.
* 1223, 1259, 1262
* 1407, 1435, 1491
* 1514, 1517, 1573
* 1600, 1660, 1684, 1695
* 1709, 1716, 1718, 1740, 1755, 1763, 1789
* 1830, 1880, 1891, 1895
* 1929, 1963

==Water quality==
Lake Zurich&#x27;s water is very clean and reaches, during summer, temperatures well beyond . Swimming in the public baths and beaches is very popular. The lake&#x27;s water is purified and fed into Zurich&#x27;s water system; it is potable.

<text>Putrajaya (), officially the Federal Territory of Putrajaya (), is the administrative centre of Malaysia. The seat of the federal government of Malaysia was moved in 1999 from Kuala Lumpur to Putrajaya because of overcrowding and congestion, whilst the seat of the judiciary of Malaysia was later moved to Putrajaya in 2003. Kuala Lumpur remains as Malaysia&#x27;s national capital city per the constitution and is still the seat of the head of state (Yang di-Pertuan Agong) and the national legislature (Parliament of Malaysia), as well as being the country&#x27;s commercial and financial centre.

The establishment of Putrajaya was the idea of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. First thought of in the 1990s, Putrajaya was envisioned to be “a laboratory for a new form of electronic government&quot; that would emphasize new adoption of, investment in internet, media, and digital communications. The development of Putrajaya began in August 1995 and was completed at an estimated cost of US$8.1 billion. On 1 February 2001, Putrajaya became Malaysia&#x27;s third federal territory, after Kuala Lumpur in 1974 and Labuan in 1984. Putrajaya is also a part of MSC Malaysia, a special economic zone that covers Klang Valley.

== Etymology ==
Putrajaya was named after the first Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj. The name is derived from the Sanskrit language, which was then adopted into Malay; &quot;putra&quot; (पुत्र) means son and &quot;jaya&quot; (जया) means &quot;success&quot; or &quot;victory&quot;; hence Putrajaya means victorious men or people. The name was decided in late 1994.

== History and design ==
&quot;Prang Besar&quot; (alternately &quot;Perang Besar&quot;, which is Malay for &quot;Great War&quot;), was founded in 1921 on land that was jungle, as a rubber plantation by British veterans of World War I, hence its name. Its land area of expanded to , and was merged with surrounding estates, including Estet Raja Alang, Estet Galloway and Estet Bukit Prang.

Until 1975, what is today Putrajaya, along with adjacent Cyberjaya, was under the administration of Hulu Langat District.

The vision of a new Federal Government Administrative Centre to replace Kuala Lumpur as the administrative capital emerged in the late 1980s, during the tenure of Malaysia&#x27;s fourth prime minister, Mahathir bin Mohamad. A new city adjacent to Kuala Lumpur was envisioned, where the government would systematically locate its government offices within an efficient administrative hub; as opposed having government offices scattered across the congested Kuala Lumpur. The new city was proposed to be located between Kuala Lumpur and the new Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA). Two areas were proposed: Prang Besar and Janda Baik of Pahang. The new name was chosen for the site.

The federal government negotiated with the state of Selangor on the prospect of another federal territory. In the mid-1990s, the federal government paid a substantial amount of money to Selangor for approximately of land in Prang Besar, Selangor. As a result of this land purchase, Selangor now surrounds two federal territories: Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya.

Planned as a garden city and an intelligent city, 38% of the area is green spaces in which the natural landscape is enhanced. The plan incorporated a network of open spaces and wide boulevards. Construction began in August 1995; it was Malaysia&#x27;s biggest project and one of Southeast Asia&#x27;s largest, with an estimated final cost of US$8.1 billion. The entire project was designed and constructed by Malaysian companies, with only 10% imported materials. Most buildings in Putrajaya were built with conscious use of particular Islamic elements from the Middle East and Central Asia like those of Baghdad and Damascus, designed to reflect a cosmopolitan pan-Islamic identity emulating those regions espoused by Mahathir&#x27;s government, rather than taking from homegrown elements that had taken hold in Southeast Asia or those brought from India (like the neo-Mughal buildings of Kuala Lumpur).

The 1997 Asian financial crisis somewhat slowed the development of Putrajaya. 300 members of the Prime Minister&#x27;s office staff moved there in 1999, and the remaining government servants moved in 2005. On 1 February 2001, the city was formally transferred to the federal government and declared Malaysia&#x27;s third federal territory.

In 2002, KLIA Transit rail line was opened, linking Putrajaya to KLIA in Sepang. The construction of the Putrajaya Monorail, which was intended to be the city&#x27;s metro system, was suspended owing to high costs. One of the monorail suspension bridges in Putrajaya remains unused.

In April 2013, the Putrajaya government signed a letter of intent (LOI) with the government of Sejong City in South Korea to mark co-operation between the two cities.

==Government and politics==
Government ministries and bodies remaining in Kuala Lumpur include the Ministry of Investment, Trade and Industry (MITI), Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and Ministry of Works (KKR), as well as Bank Negara Malaysia, Royal Malaysian Police and Malayan Railways. The Parliament of Malaysia also remained in Kuala Lumpur, as well as the Yang di-Pertuan Agong (King) of Malaysia. Foreign embassies and missions except Brunei still remain in Kuala Lumpur.

The local government in Putrajaya is the responsibility of the Putrajaya Corporation (&quot;Perbadanan Putrajaya&quot;), a unique local authority. Previously it was administered by the Sepang District Council.

Putrajaya is represented in the Parliament of Malaysia by one elected MP in the Dewan Rakyat, under the seat of Putrajaya, as well as one appointed senator in the Dewan Negara.

As with the other federal territories of Malaysia, Putrajaya does not have a territorial legislature.

<text>The Strait of Malacca is a narrow stretch of water, long and from wide, between the Malay Peninsula to the northeast and the Indonesian island of Sumatra to the southwest, connecting the Andaman Sea (Indian Ocean) and the South China Sea (Pacific Ocean). As the main shipping channel between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is one of the most important shipping lanes in the world.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Malacca&quot; is traditionally associated with the Malacca tree (&quot;Phyllanthus emblica&quot;), also known as the Indian gooseberry tree, and is believed to derive from the local Malay word &quot;Melaka&quot;. According to historical traditions, Parameswara, a Sumatran prince and the founder of the Malacca Sultanate, selected the site for his new kingdom where the city of Malacca now stands. It is said that he named the location &quot;Melaka&quot; after the Malacca tree under which he had rested. Over time, the name &quot;Malacca&quot; came to refer not only to the city but also to the strategically significant waterway between the Malay Peninsula and the Indonesian island of Sumatra, known as the Malacca Strait.

==Extent==
The International Hydrographic Organization define the limits of the Strait of Malacca as follows:

==History==

Early traders from Arabia, Africa, Persia, and southern India reached Kedah before arriving at Guangzhou. Kedah served as a western port on the Malay Peninsula. They traded glassware, camphor, cotton goods, brocades, ivory, sandalwood, perfume, and precious stones. These traders sailed to Kedah via the monsoon winds between June and November. They returned between December and May. Kedah provided accommodations, porters, small vessels, bamboo rafts, elephants, as well as tax collections for goods to be transported overland toward eastern ports of the Malay Peninsula such as Langkasuka and Kelantan. After the tenth century, ships from China began to trade at these eastern trading posts and ports. Kedah and Funan were famous ports throughout the 6th century, before shipping began to use the Strait of Malacca itself as a trade route.

In the 7th century, the maritime empire of Srivijaya, based in Palembang, Sumatra, rose to power, and its influence expanded to the Malay Peninsula and Java. The empire gained effective control of two major choke points in maritime Southeast Asia: the Strait of Malacca and the Sunda Strait. By launching a series of conquests and raids on potential rival ports on both sides of the strait, Srivijaya ensured its economic and military domination in the region, which lasted about 700 years. Srivijaya gained great benefits from the lucrative spice trade, e.g. the tributary trade system with China, and trade with Indian and Arab merchants. The Strait of Malacca became an important maritime trade route between India and China. The importance of the Strait of Malacca in global trade networks continued well into later centuries with the rise of the Malacca Sultanate in the 15th century, the Johor Sultanate, the Straits Settlements, and the modern city-state of Singapore.

Since the 17th century, the strait has been the main shipping channel between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. Various major regional powers have managed the straits during different historical periods.

==Economic importance==

From an economic and strategic perspective, the Strait of Malacca is one of the most important shipping lanes in the world.

The strait is the main shipping channel between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, linking major Asian economies such as India, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Vietnam, China, Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea. The Strait of Malacca is part of the Maritime Silk Road that runs from the Chinese coast towards the southern tip of India to Mombasa, from there through the Red Sea via the Suez Canal to the Mediterranean, there to the upper Adriatic region to the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its rail connections to Central Europe and the North Sea. Over 94,000 vessels pass through the strait each year (2008) making it the busiest strait in the world, carrying about 25% of the world&#x27;s traded goods, including oil, Chinese manufactured products, coal, palm oil and Indonesian coffee. About a quarter of all oil carried by sea passes through the strait, mainly from Persian Gulf suppliers to Asian markets. In 2007, an estimated 13.7 million barrels per day were transported through the strait, increasing to an estimated 15.2 million barrels per day in 2011. In addition, it is also one of the world&#x27;s most congested shipping choke points because it narrows to only 2.8 km (1.5 nautical miles) wide at the Phillip Channel (close to southern Singapore).

The draught of some of the world&#x27;s largest ships (mostly oil tankers) exceeds the Strait&#x27;s minimum depth of . This shallow point occurs in the Singapore Strait. The maximum size of a vessel that can pass through the Strait is referred to as the Malaccamax. The next closest passageway to the east, the Sunda Strait between Sumatra and Java, is even shallower and narrower, meaning that ships exceeding the Malaccamax must detour a few thousand nautical miles and use the Lombok Strait, Makassar Strait, Sibutu Passage, and Mindoro Strait instead.

==Shipping hazards==

Piracy has been a problem in the strait. Piracy had been high in the 2000s, with additional increase after the events of September 11, 2001. After attacks rose again in the first half of 2004, regional navies stepped up their patrols of the area in July 2004. Subsequently, attacks on ships in the Strait of Malacca dropped, to 79 in 2005 and 50 in 2006. Attacks have dropped to near zero in recent years.

There are 34 shipwrecks, some dating to the 1880s, in the local TSS channel (the channel for commercial ships under the global Traffic Separation Scheme). These pose a collision hazard in the narrow and shallow strait.

On 20 August 2017, the United States Navy destroyer lost ten of its crew&#x27;s lives in a collision with the merchant ship &quot;Alnic MC&quot; a short distance east of the strait whilst full steering capabilities had been lost. The ship had made a series of errors in attempted mitigation, its external lights being changed to &quot;red over red&quot; (&quot;vessel not under command&quot;).
Another risk is the annual haze due to wildfires in Sumatra, Indonesia. It may reduce visibility to , forcing ships to slow in the busy strait. The strait is frequently used by ships longer than.

==Proposals to relieve the strait==

Thailand has developed plans to divert much of the strait&#x27;s traffic and hence some of its economic significance to a shorter route: the Thai government has several times proposed cutting a canal through the Isthmus of Kra, saving around from the journey between the two oceans. China has offered to cover the costs, according to a report leaked to &quot;The Washington Times&quot; in 2004. Nevertheless, and despite the support of several Thai politicians, the prohibitive financial and ecological costs suggest that the canal will not be built.

An alternative is to install a pipeline across the Isthmus of Kra to carry oil to ships waiting on the other side. Proponents calculate it would cut the cost of oil delivery to Asia by about $0.50/barrel ($3/m3). Myanmar has also made a similar pipeline proposal.

<text>Quidditch () is a fictional sport invented by author J. K. Rowling for her fantasy book series &quot;Harry Potter&quot;. It first appeared in the novel &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; (1997). In the series, Quidditch is portrayed as a dangerous but popular sport played by witches and wizards riding flying broomsticks.

Matches are played on a large oval pitch with three ring-shaped goals of different heights on each side, between two opposing teams of seven players each: three Chasers, two Beaters, the Keeper, and the Seeker. The Chasers and the Keeper respectively score with and defend the goals against the Quaffle; the two Beaters bat the Bludgers away from their teammates and towards their opponents; and the Seeker locates and catches the Golden Snitch, whose capture simultaneously wins the Seeker&#x27;s team 150 points and ends the game. The team with the most points at the end wins.

Harry Potter plays as Seeker for his house team at Hogwarts. Regional and international Quidditch competitions are mentioned throughout the series. Aspects of the sport&#x27;s history are revealed in &quot;Quidditch Through the Ages&quot;, published by Rowling in 2001 to benefit Comic Relief.

A real-life version of the game has been created, in which the players use brooms, but run instead of flying.

==Development==
Rowling came up with the sport in a Manchester hotel room after an argument with her then-boyfriend. She explained: &quot;I had been pondering the things that hold a society together, cause it to congregate and signify its particular character and knew I needed a sport.&quot; Rowling claims that the word &quot;Quidditch&quot; is not derived from any particular etymological root, but was the result of filling five pages of a notebook with different words beginning with &quot;Q&quot;.

Despite the sport&#x27;s popularity with fans, Rowling grew to dislike describing the matches. She commented in an interview:

The final Quidditch scene in the books appears in &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;. Rowling experienced &quot;fiendish glee&quot; writing this scene, which features memorable commentary by Luna Lovegood.

Quidditch is introduced in &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, and is a regularly recurring feature throughout the first six books. It is depicted as being played by both professionals (as in tournaments like the Quidditch World Cup) and amateurs. A major motif of five of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books is the competition among the four Hogwarts houses for the Quidditch Cup each school year; in particular, the rivalry between Gryffindor and Slytherin.

In 2014, Rowling started publishing a series of match reports from the Quidditch World Cup on Pottermore, culminating in a short story about the final featuring the return of Harry, Ron, Hermione and their friends as adults. This generated interest from several media outlets, as it was the first new writing about the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; characters since the end of the series in 2007.

Rowling published &quot;Quidditch Through the Ages&quot; in 2001 to benefit Comic Relief; &quot;Quidditch Through The Ages Illustrated Edition&quot; was published in 2020, with banners being presented to 11 towns in the UK and Ireland that in the books have Quidditch teams, including the Ballycastle Bats, Falmouth Falcons, Holyhead Harpies, Montrose Magpies, Pride of Portree and Wigtown Wanderers; two teams based in fictional places, the Chudley Cannons and Puddlemere United, were also celebrated.

===Game progression===

* Quidditch matches are played over an oval-shaped pitch, with a scoring area at each end consisting of three hooped goal posts, each at a different height. Each team is made up of seven players, consisting of three Chasers, two Beaters, one Keeper and one Seeker. 
* The job of the Chasers is to keep possession of the scarlet Quaffle, a leather ball passed between fellow chasers. They must attempt to score goals (worth 10 points) by throwing it through one of the opponents&#x27; three hoops. These hoops are defended by the opposing team&#x27;s Keeper, who ideally tries to block their goals and throw the &quot;Quaffle&quot; to fellow chasers. 
* Meanwhile, players of both teams are attacked indiscriminately by the two Bludgers. These are round, jet-black balls made of iron that fly around violently trying to knock players off their brooms. It is the Beaters&#x27; job to defend their teammates from the Bludgers; they carry short wooden clubs, which they use to knock the Bludgers away from their teammates and/or toward the opposing team. 
* Finally, the role of the Seeker is to catch the Golden Snitch. This is a small golden ball the approximate size of a walnut. The winged Snitch is enchanted to hover, dart, and fly around the pitch rapidly and indiscriminately, avoiding capture while remaining within the boundaries of the playing area. A Seeker catching the Snitch ends the game and scores the successful Seeker&#x27;s team an additional 150 points (15 goals). As the team with the most points wins, this often guarantees victory for the successful Seeker&#x27;s team. A notable exception is when Bulgaria Seeker Viktor Krum catches the Snitch for Bulgaria during the World Cup Final in &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;, while his team are still 160 points behind Ireland (their opponents), thus making his own team lose by only 10 points.

===Broomsticks===

Broomsticks are one of the forms of transportation for wizards and witches, as well as being used for playing Quidditch. The three most prominent broomsticks in the books are the Nimbus 2000, Nimbus 2001, and the Firebolt, all three of which have been produced as merchandise by Warner Bros.

The Nimbus is introduced as one of the best broomsticks in the wizarding world. Harry receives a Nimbus 2000 in &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot; so that he can play for Gryffindor house. In &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;, Lucius Malfoy buys a full set of the more advanced Nimbus 2001s for the Slytherin team as a bribe, so they would choose his son Draco as Seeker that year.

The Firebolt later supersedes the Nimbus as the fastest and one of the most expensive racing brooms in existence. Harry receives a Firebolt model from his godfather, Sirius Black, after his Nimbus 2000 is destroyed during a Quidditch match in &quot;Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;. In &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;, Harry uses his Firebolt to escape the Hungarian Horntail during the Triwizard Tournament.

===Films and video games===
Quidditch appears in five of the eight &quot;Harry Potter&quot; films. Some Quidditch subplots, such as Ron&#x27;s Keeper storyline in &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;, were cut to save time in the films. Video games that feature Quidditch include:
* Main series&#x27; video game adaptions:
** &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;
** &quot;Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&quot;
** &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot;
* &quot;Harry Potter: Quidditch&quot; series
** &quot;Harry Potter: Quidditch World Cup&quot;
** &quot;Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions&quot;
* &quot;Lego Harry Potter&quot; series
** &quot;Lego Harry Potter: Years 1–4&quot;
** &quot;Lego Harry Potter: Years 5–7&quot;

In the Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey attraction in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at the Islands of Adventure theme park, Quidditch is featured near the end where riders are flown through the Quidditch pitch. A storefront near Ollivanders Wand Shop is themed as a Quidditch supply with a Golden Snitch on the sign and a case containing animated Quaffle and Bludgers surrounded by Beaters&#x27; bats.

==Reception==
According to David K. Steege, the books &quot;follow very closely the school story tradition of making games and sports central to the boarding school experience; some of the most vivid and popular scenes in the series take place on the playing field.&quot;
However, some critics have claimed that Rowling&#x27;s presentation of Quidditch reinforces gender inequality. For example, Heilman and Donaldson argue that the female players ultimately have little impact on the outcome of the game, and it has also been noted that the female players on the Gryffindor Quidditch team have very few lines. This view has been disputed by Mimi R. Gladstein, who points to the presence of female players on the victorious Irish team at the Quidditch World Cup. She argues: &quot;The inclusion of female Quidditch players at the highest level of the sport is done without a trace of self-consciousness and their inclusion isn&#x27;t an issue within the minds of the characters.&quot; On the other hand, D. Bruno Starrs notes Quidditch&#x27;s rarity as a sport in which males and females compete against each other, and describes it as &quot;levelling&quot; the genders.

Quidditch has been criticised for its emphasis on catching the Snitch. Rowling claims that Quidditch is a sport that &quot;infuriates&quot; men in particular, who are bothered by the unrealistic scoring system. Because of the emphasis on the Snitch, legal scholar William Baude called Quidditch &quot;a really stupid game&quot;.

==Non-fictional Quidditch==

In the real world, the word &quot;Quidditch&quot;, long predating &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, occurs in some English placenames, and seems to come from Anglo-Saxon &quot;cwǣð-dīc&quot; = &quot;mud-ditch&quot;.

A street in Lower Cambourne, Cambridgeshire, England is named Quidditch Lane, supposedly after a type of nearby dry ditch called a Quidditch. Fans have been known to visit the area.

In November 2014, a plaque appeared outside the entrance of Bristol Children&#x27;s Hospital attesting that the famous hooped sculptures which stand in front of the paediatric institution are, in fact, not a interactive installation inaugurated in 2001, but instead the goalposts used in the 1998 Quidditch World Cup.

In 2017, &quot;Quidditch&quot; was defined by Oxford Dictionaries, following the inclusion of &quot;Muggle&quot; in the third (2003) edition of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;. Oxford Dictionaries associate editor Charlotte Buxton explained that Quidditch had gained recognition beyond the books, pointing to its existence as a real-life sport.

===As a real-life sport===

In 2007 the United States Quidditch Association, back then named the Intercollegiate Quidditch Association (or I.Q.A.), was founded to regulate quidditch in the United States and abroad, a very popular sport amongst college students. According to the International Quidditch Association, the current international governing body of the sport, the original rules and regulation of the popular collegiate sport known as quidditch were formed &quot;... on a sunny Sunday afternoon in 2005 by Xander Manshel and Alex Benepe, students at Middlebury College in Vermont, US&quot;. In contrast to the fictional sport, the game is played on foot while using one hand to hold a broom between the legs.

Since 2005, many American schools, such as UC Berkeley, have added Quidditch to their list of team sports. In the United States, college teams compete in their respective regions and compete in an annual national tournament, last year held in Texas and won by The University of Texas over runner-ups, The University of California, Berkeley (Cal Quidditch). The sport has since then spread across more than 25 countries and includes multiple international tournaments, including a World Cup. In 2012, the International Quidditch Association held the IQA World Cup, then named the IQA Summer Games, as the torch was passing through Oxford, UK for the Summer Olympics.

Gameplay is based on the description in the books, films, and game adaptations, though the sport has been adapted to suit real-world constraints. Quidditch is still evolving to suit safe play for the members of the teams, male and female. Apart from joining teams registered with their national governing body, individuals are also able to become an official certified referee to officiate tournaments and games throughout the year as teams compete to take part in various national and international tournaments. As the oldest national governing body, USQ has hosted a grand total of ten US Quidditch Cups as of 2017.

In the United Kingdom, the Quidditch Premier League is played between 10 teams, split between the North and South divisions. In 2017, West Midlands Revolution won the QPL.

In response to allegations of J. K. Rowling&#x27;s anti-trans positions, and Warner Bros.&#x27; ownership of the word &quot;Quidditch&quot;, US Quidditch and Major League Quidditch announced in 2022 that they were renaming the sport &quot;Quadball&quot;.
