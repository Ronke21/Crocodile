<text>Mass production, also known as flow production, series production, series manufacture, or continuous production, is the production of substantial amounts of standardized products in a constant flow, including and especially on assembly lines. Together with job production and batch production, it is one of the three main production methods.

The term &quot;mass production&quot; was popularized by a 1926 article in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; supplement that was written based on correspondence with Ford Motor Company. &quot;The New York Times&quot; used the term in the title of an article that appeared before the publication of the &quot;Britannica&quot; article.

The idea of mass production is applied to many kinds of products: from fluids and particulates handled in bulk (food, fuel, chemicals and mined minerals), to clothing, textiles, parts and assemblies of parts (household appliances and automobiles).

Some mass production techniques, such as standardized sizes and production lines, predate the Industrial Revolution by many centuries; however, it was not until the introduction of machine tools and techniques to produce interchangeable parts were developed in the mid-19th century that modern mass production was possible.

==Overview==
Mass production involves making many copies of products, very quickly, using assembly line techniques to send partially complete products to workers who each work on an individual step, rather than having a worker work on a whole product from start to finish. The emergence of mass production allowed supply to outstrip demand in many markets, forcing companies to seek new ways to become more competitive. Mass production ties into the idea of overconsumption and the idea that we as humans consume too much. 

Mass production of fluid matter typically involves piping with centrifugal pumps or screw conveyors (augers) to transfer raw materials or partially complete products between vessels. Fluid flow processes such as oil refining and bulk materials such as wood chips and pulp are automated using a system of process control which uses various instruments to measure variables such as temperature, pressure, volumetric and level, providing feedback.

Bulk materials such as coal, ores, grains and wood chips are handled by belt, chain, slat, pneumatic or screw conveyors, bucket elevators and mobile equipment such as front-end loaders. Materials on pallets are handled with forklifts. Also used for handling heavy items like reels of paper, steel or machinery are electric overhead cranes, sometimes called bridge cranes because they span large factory bays.

Mass production is capital-intensive and energy-intensive, for it uses a high proportion of machinery and energy in relation to workers. It is also usually automated while total expenditure per unit of product is decreased. However, the machinery that is needed to set up a mass production line (such as robots and machine presses) is so expensive that in order to attain profits there must be some assurance that the product will be successful.

One of the descriptions of mass production is that &quot;the skill is built into the tool&quot;, which means that the worker using the tool may not need the skill. For example, in the 19th or early 20th century, this could be expressed as &quot;the craftsmanship is in the workbench itself&quot; (not the training of the worker). Rather than having a skilled worker measure every dimension of each part of the product against the plans or the other parts as it is being formed, there were jigs ready at hand to ensure that the part was made to fit this set-up. It had already been checked that the finished part would be to specifications to fit all the other finished parts—and it would be made more quickly, with no time spent on finishing the parts to fit one another. Later, once computerized control came about (for example, CNC), jigs were obviated, but it remained true that the skill (or knowledge) was built into the tool (or process, or documentation) rather than residing in the worker&#x27;s head. This is the specialized capital required for mass production; each workbench and set of tools (or each CNC cell, or each fractionating column) is different (fine-tuned to its task).

==History==
=== Pre-industrial ===

Standardized parts and sizes and factory production techniques were developed in pre-industrial times; before the invention of machine tools the manufacture of precision parts, especially metal ones, was highly labour-intensive.

Crossbows made with bronze parts were produced in China during the Warring States period. The Qin Emperor unified China at least in part by equipping large armies with these weapons, which were fitted with a sophisticated trigger mechanism made of interchangeable parts. The Terracotta Army guarding the Emperor&#x27;s tomb is also believed to have been created through the use of standardized molds on an assembly line.

In ancient Carthage, ships of war were mass-produced on a large scale at a moderate cost, allowing them to efficiently maintain their control of the Mediterranean. Many centuries later, the Republic of Venice would follow Carthage in producing ships with prefabricated parts on an assembly line: the Venetian Arsenal produced nearly one ship every day in what was effectively the world&#x27;s first factory, which at its height employed 16,000 people.

The invention of movable type has allowed for documents such as books to be mass produced. The first movable type system was invented in China by Bi Sheng, during the reign of the Song dynasty, where it was used to, among other things, issue paper money. The oldest extant book produced using metal type is &quot;Jikji&quot;, printed in Korea in the year 1377. Johannes Gutenberg, through his invention of the printing press and production of the Gutenberg Bible, introduced movable type to Europe. Through this introduction, mass production in the European publishing industry was made commonplace, leading to a democratization of knowledge, increased literacy and education, and the beginnings of modern science. 

French artillery engineer Jean-Baptiste de Gribeauval introduced the standardization of cannon design in the late 18th century. He streamlined production and management of cannonballs and cannons by limiting them to only three calibers, and he improved their effectiveness by requiring more spherical ammunition. Redesigning these weapons to use interchangeable wheels, screws, and axles simplified mass production and repair.

===Industrial===
In the Industrial Revolution, simple mass production techniques were used at the Portsmouth Block Mills in England to make ships&#x27; pulley blocks for the Royal Navy in the Napoleonic Wars. It was achieved in 1803 by Marc Isambard Brunel in cooperation with Henry Maudslay under the management of Sir Samuel Bentham. The first unmistakable examples of manufacturing operations carefully designed to reduce production costs by specialized labour and the use of machines appeared in the 18th century in England.
The Navy was in a state of expansion that required 100,000 pulley blocks to be manufactured a year. Bentham had already achieved remarkable efficiency at the docks by introducing power-driven machinery and reorganising the dockyard system. Brunel, a pioneering engineer, and Maudslay, a pioneer of machine tool technology who had developed the first industrially practical screw-cutting lathe in 1800 which standardized screw thread sizes for the first time which in turn allowed the application of interchangeable parts, collaborated on plans to manufacture block-making machinery. By 1805, the dockyard had been fully updated with the revolutionary, purpose-built machinery at a time when products were still built individually with different components. A total of 45 machines were required to perform 22 processes on the blocks, which could be made into one of three possible sizes. The machines were almost entirely made of metal thus improving their accuracy and durability. The machines would make markings and indentations on the blocks to ensure alignment throughout the process. One of the many advantages of this new method was the increase in labour productivity due to the less labour-intensive requirements of managing the machinery. Richard Beamish, assistant to Brunel&#x27;s son and engineer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel, wrote:
So that ten men, by the aid of this machinery, can accomplish with uniformity, celerity and ease, what formerly required the uncertain labour of one hundred and ten.

By 1808, annual production from the 45 machines had reached 130,000 blocks and some of the equipment was still in operation as late as the mid-twentieth century. Mass production techniques were also used to rather limited extent to make clocks and watches, and to make small arms, though parts were usually non-interchangeable. Though produced on a very small scale, Crimean War gunboat engines designed and assembled by John Penn of Greenwich are recorded as the first instance of the application of mass production techniques (though not necessarily the assembly-line method) to marine engineering. In filling an Admiralty order for 90 sets to his high-pressure and high-revolution horizontal trunk engine design, Penn produced them all in 90 days. He also used Whitworth Standard threads throughout. Prerequisites for the wide use of mass production were interchangeable parts, machine tools and power, especially in the form of electricity.

Some of the organizational management concepts needed to create 20th-century mass production, such as scientific management, had been pioneered by other engineers (most of whom are not famous, but Frederick Winslow Taylor is one of the well-known ones), whose work would later be synthesized into fields such as industrial engineering, manufacturing engineering, operations research, and management consultancy. Although after leaving the Henry Ford Company which was rebranded as Cadillac and later was awarded the Dewar Trophy in 1908 for creating interchangeable mass-produced precision engine parts, Henry Ford downplayed the role of Taylorism in the development of mass production at his company. However, Ford management performed time studies and experiments to mechanize their factory processes, focusing on minimizing worker movements. The difference is that while Taylor focused mostly on efficiency of the worker, Ford also substituted for labor by using machines, thoughtfully arranged, wherever possible.

In 1807, Eli Terry was hired to produce 4,000 wooden movement clocks in the Porter Contract. At this time, the annual yield for wooden clocks did not exceed a few dozen on average. Terry developed a milling machine in 1795, in which he perfected Interchangeable parts. In 1807, Terry developed a spindle cutting machine, which could produce multiple parts at the same time. Terry hired Silas Hoadley and Seth Thomas to work the Assembly line at the facilities. The Porter Contract was the first contract which called for mass production of clock movements in history. In 1815, Terry began mass-producing the first shelf clock. Chauncey Jerome, an apprentice of Eli Terry mass-produced up to 20,000 brass clocks annually in 1840 when he invented the cheap 30-hour OG clock.

The United States Department of War sponsored the development of interchangeable parts for guns produced at the arsenals at Springfield, Massachusetts and Harpers Ferry, Virginia (now West Virginia) in the early decades of the 19th century, finally achieving reliable interchangeability by about 1850. This period coincided with the development of machine tools, with the armories designing and building many of their own. Some of the methods employed were a system of gauges for checking dimensions of the various parts and jigs and fixtures for guiding the machine tools and properly holding and aligning the work pieces. This system came to be known as &quot;armory practice&quot; or the &quot;American system of manufacturing&quot;, which spread throughout New England aided by skilled mechanics from the armories who were instrumental in transferring the technology to the sewing machines manufacturers and other industries such as machine tools, harvesting machines and bicycles. Singer Manufacturing Co., at one time the largest sewing machine manufacturer, did not achieve interchangeable parts until the late 1880s, around the same time Cyrus McCormick adopted modern manufacturing practices in making harvesting machines.

During World War II, The United States mass-produced many vehicles and weapons, such as ships (i.e. Liberty Ships, Higgins boats ), aircraft (i.e. North American P-51 Mustang, Consolidated B-24 Liberator, Boeing B-29 Superfortress), jeeps (i.e. Willys MB), trucks, tanks (i.e. M4 Sherman) and M2 Browning and M1919 Browning machine guns. Many vehicles, transported by ships have been shipped in parts and later assembled on-site.

For the ongoing energy transition, many wind turbine components and solar panels are being mass-produced. Wind turbines and solar panels are being used in respectively wind farms and solar farms.

In addition, in the ongoing climate change mitigation, large-scale carbon sequestration (through reforestation, blue carbon restoration, etc) has been proposed. Some projects (such as the Trillion Tree Campaign) involve planting a very large amount of trees. In order to speed up such efforts, fast propagation of trees may be useful. Some automated machines have been produced to allow for fast (vegetative) plant propagation.Also, for some plants that help to sequester carbon (such as seagrass), techniques have been developed to help speed up the process .

Mass production benefited from the development of materials such as inexpensive steel, high strength steel and plastics. Machining of metals was greatly enhanced with high-speed steel and later very hard materials such as tungsten carbide for cutting edges. Fabrication using steel components was aided by the development of electric welding and stamped steel parts, both which appeared in industry in about 1890. Plastics such as polyethylene, polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) can be easily formed into shapes by extrusion, blow molding or injection molding, resulting in very low cost manufacture of consumer products, plastic piping, containers and parts.

An influential article that helped to frame and popularize the 20th century&#x27;s definition of mass production appeared in a 1926 &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; supplement. The article was written based on correspondence with Ford Motor Company and is sometimes credited as the first use of the term.

=== Factory electrification ===
Electrification of factories began very gradually in the 1890s after the introduction of a practical DC motor by Frank J. Sprague and accelerated after the AC motor was developed by Galileo Ferraris, Nikola Tesla and Westinghouse, Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky and others. Electrification of factories was fastest between 1900 and 1930, aided by the establishment of electric utilities with central stations and the lowering of electricity prices from 1914 to 1917.

Electric motors were several times more efficient than small steam engines because central station generation were more efficient than small steam engines and because line shafts and belts had high friction losses. Electric motors also allowed more flexibility in manufacturing and required less maintenance than line shafts and belts. Many factories saw a 30% increase in output simply from changing over to electric motors.

Electrification enabled modern mass production, as with Thomas Edison&#x27;s iron ore processing plant (about 1893) that could process 20,000 tons of ore per day with two shifts, each of five men. At that time it was still common to handle bulk materials with shovels, wheelbarrows and small narrow-gauge rail cars, and for comparison, a canal digger in previous decades typically handled five tons per 12-hour day.

The biggest impact of early mass production was in manufacturing everyday items, such as at the Ball Brothers Glass Manufacturing Company, which electrified its mason jar plant in Muncie, Indiana, U.S., around 1900. The new automated process used glass-blowing machines to replace 210 craftsman glass blowers and helpers. A small electric truck was used to handle 150 dozen bottles at a time where previously a hand truck would carry six dozen. Electric mixers replaced men with shovels handling sand and other ingredients that were fed into the glass furnace. An electric overhead crane replaced 36 day laborers for moving heavy loads across the factory.

According to Henry Ford:
The provision of a whole new system of electric generation emancipated industry from the leather belt and line shaft, for it eventually became possible to provide each tool with its own electric motor. This may seem only a detail of minor importance. In fact, modern industry could not be carried out with the belt and line shaft for a number of reasons. The motor enabled machinery to be arranged in the order of the work, and that alone has probably doubled the efficiency of industry, for it has cut out a tremendous amount of useless handling and hauling. The belt and line shaft were also tremendously wasteful – so wasteful indeed that no factory could be really large, for even the longest line shaft was small according to modern requirements. Also high speed tools were impossible under the old conditions – neither the pulleys nor the belts could stand modern speeds. Without high speed tools and the finer steels which they brought about, there could be nothing of what we call modern industry.
Mass production was popularized in the late 1910s and 1920s by Henry Ford&#x27;s Ford Motor Company, which introduced electric motors to the then-well-known technique of chain or sequential production. Ford also bought or designed and built special purpose machine tools and fixtures such as multiple spindle drill presses that could drill every hole on one side of an engine block in one operation and a multiple head milling machine that could simultaneously machine 15 engine blocks held on a single fixture. All of these machine tools were arranged systematically in the production flow and some had special carriages for rolling heavy items into machining position. Production of the Ford Model T used 32,000 machine tools.

===Buildings===
The process of prefabrication, wherein parts are created separately from the finished product, is at the core of all mass-produced construction. Early examples include movable structures reportedly utilized by Akbar the Great, and the chattel houses built by emancipated slaves on Barbados. The Nissen hut, first used by the British during World War I, married prefabrication and mass production in a way that suited the needs of the military. The simple structures, which cost little and could be erected in just a couple of hours, were highly successful: over 100,000 Nissen huts were produced during World War I alone, and they would go on to serve in other conflicts and inspire a number of similar designs.

Following World War II, in the United States, William Levitt pioneered the building of standardized tract houses in 56 different locations around the country. These communities were dubbed Levittowns, and they were able to be constructed quickly and cheaply through the leveraging of economies of scale, as well as the specialization of construction tasks in a process akin to an assembly line. This era also saw the invention of the mobile home, a small prefabricated house that can be transported cheaply on a truck bed.

In the modern industrialization of construction, mass production is often used for prefabrication of house components.
Fabrics and Materials

Mass production has significantly impacted the fashion industry, particularly in the realm of fibers and materials. The advent of synthetic fibers, such as polyester and nylon, revolutionized textile manufacturing by providing cost-effective alternatives to natural fibers. This shift enabled the rapid production of inexpensive clothing, contributing to the rise of fast fashion. This reliance on mass production has raised concerns about environmental sustainability and labor conditions, spurring the need for greater ethical and sustainable practices within the fashion industry.

==The use of assembly lines==

Mass production systems for items made of numerous parts are usually organized into assembly lines. The assemblies pass by on a conveyor, or if they are heavy, hung from an overhead crane or monorail.

In a factory for a complex product, rather than one assembly line, there may be many auxiliary assembly lines feeding sub-assemblies (i.e. car engines or seats) to a backbone &quot;main&quot; assembly line. A diagram of a typical mass-production factory looks more like the skeleton of a fish than a single line.

==Vertical integration==
Vertical integration is a business practice that involves gaining complete control over a product&#x27;s production, from raw materials to final assembly.

In the age of mass production, this caused shipping and trade problems in that shipping systems were unable to transport huge volumes of finished automobiles (in Henry Ford&#x27;s case) without causing damage, and also government policies imposed trade barriers on finished units.

Ford built the Ford River Rouge Complex with the idea of making the company&#x27;s own iron and steel in the same large factory site where parts and car assembly took place. River Rouge also generated its own electricity.

Upstream vertical integration, such as to raw materials, is away from leading technology toward mature, low-return industries. Most companies chose to focus on their core business rather than vertical integration. This included buying parts from outside suppliers, who could often produce them as cheaply or cheaper.

Standard Oil, the major oil company in the 19th century, was vertically integrated partly because there was no demand for unrefined crude oil, but kerosene and some other products were in great demand. The other reason was that Standard Oil monopolized the oil industry. The major oil companies were, and many still are, vertically integrated, from production to refining and with their own retail stations, although some sold off their retail operations. Some oil companies also have chemical divisions.

Lumber and paper companies at one time owned most of their timber lands and sold some finished products such as corrugated boxes. The tendency has been to divest of timber lands to raise cash and to avoid property taxes.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
The economies of mass production come from several sources. The primary cause is a reduction of non-productive effort of all types. In craft production, the craftsman must bustle about a shop, getting parts and assembling them. He must locate and use many tools many times for varying tasks. In mass production, each worker repeats one or a few related tasks that use the same tool to perform identical or near-identical operations on a stream of products. The exact tool and parts are always at hand, having been moved down the assembly line consecutively. The worker spends little or no time retrieving and/or preparing materials and tools, and so the time taken to manufacture a product using mass production is shorter than when using traditional methods.

The probability of human error and variation is also reduced, as tasks are predominantly carried out by machinery; error in operating such machinery has more far-reaching consequences. A reduction in labour costs, as well as an increased rate of production, enables a company to produce a larger quantity of one product at a lower cost than using traditional, non-linear methods.

However, mass production is inflexible because it is difficult to alter a design or production process after a production line is implemented. Also, all products produced on one production line will be identical or very similar, and introducing variety to satisfy individual tastes is not easy. However, some variety can be achieved by applying different finishes and decorations at the end of the production line if necessary. The starter cost for the machinery can be expensive so the producer must be sure it sells or the producers will lose a lot of money.

The Ford Model T produced tremendous affordable output but was not very good at responding to demand for variety, , or design changes. As a consequence Ford eventually lost market share to General Motors, who introduced annual model changes, more accessories and a choice of colors.

With each passing decade, engineers have found ways to increase the flexibility of mass production systems, driving down the lead times on new product development and allowing greater customization and variety of products.

Compared with other production methods, mass production can create new occupational hazards for workers. This is partly due to the need for workers to operate heavy machinery while also working close together with many other workers. Preventative safety measures, such as fire drills, as well as special training is therefore necessary to minimise the occurrence of industrial accidents.

==Socioeconomic impacts==
In the 1830s, French political thinker and historian Alexis de Tocqueville identified one of the key characteristics of America that would later make it so amenable to the development of mass production: the homogeneous consumer base. De Tocqueville wrote in his &quot;Democracy in America&quot; (1835) that &quot;The absence in the United States of those vast accumulations of wealth which favor the expenditures of large sums on articles of mere luxury ... impact to the productions of American industry a character distinct from that of other countries&#x27; industries. [Production is geared toward] articles suited to the wants of the whole people&quot;.

Mass production improved productivity, which was a contributing factor to economic growth and the decline in work week hours, alongside other factors such as transportation infrastructures (canals, railroads and highways) and agricultural mechanization. These factors caused the typical work week to decline from 70 hours in the early 19th century to 60 hours late in the century, then to 50 hours in the early 20th century and finally to 40 hours in the mid-1930s.

Mass production permitted great increases in total production. Using a European crafts system into the late 19th century it was difficult to meet demand for products such as sewing machines and animal powered mechanical harvesters. By the late 1920s many previously scarce goods were in good supply. One economist has argued that this constituted &quot;overproduction&quot; and contributed to high unemployment during the Great Depression. Say&#x27;s law denies the possibility of general overproduction and for this reason classical economists deny that it had any role in the Great Depression.

Mass production allowed the evolution of consumerism by lowering the unit cost of many goods used.

Mass production has been linked to the Fast Fashion Industry, often leaving the consumer with lower quality garments for a lower cost. Most fast-fashion clothing is mass-produced, which means it is typically made of cheap fabrics, such as polyester, and constructed poorly in order to keep short turnaround times to meet the demands of consumers and shifting trends.

<doc id="63140" wikidata="Q167852" url="?curid=63140" title="Jabir ibn Hayyan">
<text>Abū Mūsā Jābir ibn Ḥayyān (Arabic: , variously called al-Ṣūfī, al-Azdī, al-Kūfī, or al-Ṭūsī), died 806−816, is the purported author of a large number of works in Arabic, often called the Jabirian corpus. The treatises that survive today mainly deal with alchemy and chemistry, magic, and Shi&#x27;ite religious philosophy. However, the original scope of the corpus was vast, covering a wide range of topics ranging from cosmology, astronomy and astrology, over medicine, pharmacology, zoology and botany, to metaphysics, logic, and grammar.

The works attributed to Jabir, which are tentatively dated to , contain the oldest known systematic classification of chemical substances, and the oldest known instructions for deriving an inorganic compound (sal ammoniac or ammonium chloride) from organic substances (such as plants, blood, and hair) by chemical means. His works also contain one of the earliest known versions of the sulfur-mercury theory of metals, a mineralogical theory that would remain dominant until the 18th century.

A significant part of Jabir&#x27;s writings deal with a philosophical theory known as &quot;the science of the balance&quot; (Arabic: &quot;ʿilm al-mīzān&quot;), which was aimed at reducing all phenomena (including material substances and their elements) to a system of measures and quantitative proportions. The Jabirian works also contain some of the earliest preserved Shi&#x27;ite imamological doctrines, which Jabir presented as deriving from his purported master, the Shi&#x27;ite Imam Jaʿfar al-Ṣādiq (died 765).

As early as the 10th century, the identity and exact corpus of works of Jabir was in dispute in Islamic scholarly circles. The authorship of all these works by a single figure, and even the existence of a historical Jabir, are also doubted by modern scholars. Instead, Jabir ibn Hayyan is generally thought to have been a pseudonym used by an anonymous school of Shi&#x27;ite alchemists writing in the late 9th and early 10th centuries.

Some Arabic Jabirian works (e.g., &quot;The Great Book of Mercy&quot;, and &quot;The Book of Seventy&quot;) were translated into Latin under the Latinized name Geber, and in 13th-century Europe an anonymous writer, usually referred to as pseudo-Geber, started to produce alchemical and metallurgical writings under this name.

== Biography ==
=== Historicity ===
It is not clear whether Jabir ibn Hayyan ever existed as a historical person. He is purported to have lived in the 8th century, and to have been a disciple of the Shi&#x27;ite Imam Jaʿfar al-Ṣādiq (died 765). However, he is not mentioned in any historical source before c. 900, and the first known author to write about Jabir from a biographical point of view was the Baghdadi bibliographer Ibn al-Nadīm (c. 932–995). In his &quot;Fihrist&quot; (&quot;The Book Catalogue&quot;, written in 987), Ibn al-Nadīm compiled a list of Jabir&#x27;s works, adding a short notice on the various claims that were then circulating about Jabir. Already in Ibn al-Nadīm&#x27;s time, there were some people who explicitly asserted that Jabir had never existed, although Ibn al-Nadīm himself disagreed with this claim. Jabir was often ignored by later medieval Islamic biographers and historians, but even early Shi&#x27;ite biographers such as Aḥmad al-Barqī (died c. 893), Abū ʿAmr al-Kashshī (first half of the 10th century), Aḥmad ibn ʿAlī al-Najāshī (983–1058), and Abū Jaʿfar al-Ṭūsī (995–1067), who wrote long volumes on the companions of the Shi&#x27;ite Imams (including the many companions of Jaʿfar al-Ṣādiq), did not mention Jabir at all.

=== Dating of the Jabirian corpus ===
Apart from outright denying his existence, there were also some who, already in Ibn al-Nadīm&#x27;s time, questioned whether the writings attributed to Jabir were really written by him. The authenticity of these writings was expressly denied by the Baghdadi philosopher Abū Sulaymān al-Sijistānī (c. 912–985) and his pupil Abū Ḥayyān al-Tawḥīdī (c. 932–1023), though this may have been related to the hostility of both these thinkers to alchemy in general. Modern scholarly analysis has tended to confirm the inauthenticity of the writings attributed to Jabir. Much of the philosophical terminology used in the Jabirian treatises was only coined around the middle of the 9th century, and some of the Greek philosophical texts cited in the Jabirian writings are known to have been translated into Arabic towards the end of the 9th century. Moreover, an important part of the corpus deals with early Shi&#x27;ite religious philosophy that is elsewhere only attested in late 9th-century and early 10th-century sources. As a result, the dating of the Jabirian corpus to c. 850–950 has been widely accepted in modern scholarship. However, it has also been noted that many Jabirian treatises show clear signs of having been redacted multiple times, and the writings as we now have them may well have been based on an earlier 8th-century core. Despite the obscurity involved, it is not impossible that some of these writings, in their earliest form, were written by a real Jabir ibn Hayyan. In any case, it is clear that Jabir&#x27;s name was used as a pseudonym by one or more anonymous Shi&#x27;ite alchemists writing in the late 9th and early 10th centuries, who also redacted the corpus as we now know it.

=== Biographical clues and legend ===
Jabir was generally known by the &quot;kunya&quot; Abū Mūsā (&quot;Father of Mūsā&quot;), or sometimes Abū ʿAbd Allāh (&quot;Father of ʿAbd Allāh&quot;), and by the &quot;nisba&quot;s (attributive names) al-Ṣūfī, al-Azdī, al-Kūfī, or al-Ṭūsī. His grandfather&#x27;s name is mentioned by Ibn al-Nadim as ʿAbd Allāh. If the attribution of the name al-Azdī to Jabir is authentic, this would point to his affiliation with the Southern-Arabian (Yemenite) tribe of the Azd. However, it is not clear whether Jabir was an Arab belonging to the Azd tribe, or a non-Arab Muslim client (&quot;mawlā&quot;) of the Azd. If he was a non-Arab Muslim client of the Azd, he is most likely to have been Persian, given his ties with eastern Iran (his &quot;nisba&quot; al-Ṭūsī also points to Tus, a city in Khurasan). According to Ibn al-Nadīm, Jabir hailed from Khurasan (eastern Iran), but spent most of his life in Kufa (Iraq), both regions where the Azd tribe was well-settled. Various late reports put his date of death between 806 (190 AH) and 816 (200 AH).

Given the lack of independent biographical sources, most of the biographical information about Jabir can be traced back to the Jabirian writings themselves. There are references throughout the Jabirian corpus to the Shi&#x27;ite Imam Jaʿfar al-Ṣādiq (died 765), whom Jabir generally calls &quot;my master&quot; (Arabic: &quot;sayyidī&quot;), and whom he represents as the original source of all his knowledge. In one work, Jabir is also represented as an associate of the Bactrian vizier family of the Barmakids, whereas Ibn al-Nadīm reports that some claimed Jabir to have been especially devoted to Jaʿfar ibn Yaḥyā al-Barmakī (767–803), the Abbasid vizier of &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; fame. Jabir&#x27;s links with the Abbasids were stressed even more by later tradition, which turned him into a favorite of the Abbasid caliph Hārūn al-Rashīd (c. 763–809, also appearing in &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;), for whom Jabir would have composed a treatise on alchemy, and who is supposed to have commanded the translation of Greek works into Arabic on Jabir&#x27;s instigation.

Given Jabir&#x27;s purported ties with both the Shi&#x27;ite Imam Jaʿfar al-Ṣādiq and the Barmakid family (who served the Abbasids as viziers), or with the Abbasid caliphs themselves, it has sometimes been thought plausible that Ḥayyān al-ʿAṭṭār (&quot;Hayyan the Druggist&quot;), a proto-Shi&#x27;ite activist who was fighting for the Abbasid cause in the early 8th century, may have been Jabir&#x27;s father (Jabir&#x27;s name &quot;Ibn Hayyan&quot; literally means &quot;The Son of Hayyan&quot;). Although there is no direct evidence supporting this hypothesis, it fits very well in the historical context, and it allows one to think of Jabir, however obscure, as a historical figure. Because Ḥayyān al-ʿAṭṭār was supposedly executed not long after 721, the hypothesis even made it possible to estimate Jabir&#x27;s date of birth at . However, it has recently been argued that Ḥayyān al-ʿAṭṭār probably lived at least until , and that as a client (&quot;mawlā&quot;) of the Nakhaʿ tribe he is highly unlikely to have been the father of Jabir (who is supposed to have been a client/member of the Azd).

== The Jabirian corpus ==
There are about 600 Arabic works attributed to Jabir ibn Hayyan that are known by name, approximately 215 of which are still extant today. Though some of these are full-length works (e.g., &quot;The Great Book on Specific Properties&quot;), most of them are relatively short treatises and belong to larger collections (&quot;The One Hundred and Twelve Books&quot;, &quot;The Five Hundred Books&quot;, etc.) in which they function rather more like chapters. When the individual chapters of some full-length works are counted as separate treatises too, the total length of the corpus may be estimated at 3000 treatises/chapters.

The overwhelming majority of Jabirian treatises that are still extant today deal with alchemy or chemistry (though these may also contain religious speculations, and discuss a wide range of other topics ranging from cosmology to grammar). Nevertheless, there are also a few extant treatises which deal with magic, i.e., &quot;the science of talismans&quot; (&quot;ʿilm al-ṭilasmāt&quot;, a form of theurgy) and &quot;the science of specific properties&quot; (&quot;ʿilm al-khawāṣṣ&quot;, the science dealing with the hidden powers of mineral, vegetable and animal substances, and with their practical applications in medical and various other pursuits). Other writings dealing with a great variety of subjects were also attributed to Jabir (this includes such subjects as engineering, medicine, pharmacology, zoology, botany, logic, metaphysics, mathematics, astronomy and astrology), but almost all of these are lost today.

=== Alchemical writings ===

Note that Paul Kraus, who first catalogued the Jabirian writings and whose numbering is followed here, conceived of his division of Jabir&#x27;s alchemical writings (Kr. nos. 5–1149) as roughly chronological in order.

* The Great Book of Mercy (&quot;Kitāb al-Raḥma al-kabīr&quot;, Kr. no. 5): This was considered by Kraus to be the oldest work in the corpus, from which it may have been relatively independent. Some 10th-century skeptics considered it to be the only authentic work written by Jabir himself. The Persian physician, alchemist and philosopher Abū Bakr al-Rāzī (c. 865–925) appears to have written a (lost) commentary on it. It was translated into Latin in the 13th century under the title &quot;Liber Misericordiae&quot;.
* The One Hundred and Twelve Books (&quot;al-Kutub al-miʾa wa-l-ithnā ʿashar&quot;, Kr. nos. 6–122): This collection consists of relatively independent treatises dealing with different practical aspects of alchemy, often framed as an explanation of the symbolic allusions of the &#x27;ancients&#x27;. An important role is played by organic alchemy. Its theoretical foundations are similar to those of &quot;The Seventy Books&quot; (i.e., the reduction of bodies to the elements fire, air, water and earth, and of the elements to the &#x27;natures&#x27; hot, cold, moist, and dry), though their exposition is less systematic. Just like in &quot;The Seventy Books&quot;, the quantitative directions in &quot;The One Hundred and Twelve Books&quot; are still of a practical and &#x27;experimental&#x27; rather than of a theoretical and speculative nature, such as will be the case in &quot;The Books of the Balances&quot;. The first four treatises in this collection, i.e., the three-part &quot;Book of the Element of the Foundation&quot; (&quot;Kitāb Usṭuqus al-uss&quot;, Kr. nos. 6–8, the second part of which contains an early version of the famous &quot;Emerald Tablet&quot; attributed to Hermes Trismegistus) and a commentary on it (&quot;Tafsīr kitāb al-usṭuqus&quot;, Kr. no. 9), have been translated into English.
* The Seventy Books (&quot;al-Kutub al-sabʿūn&quot;, Kr. nos. 123–192) (also called &quot;The Book of Seventy&quot;, &quot;Kitāb al-Sabʿīn&quot;): This contains a systematic exposition of Jabirian alchemy, in which the several treatises form a much more unified whole as compared to &quot;The One Hundred and Twelve Books&quot;. It is organized into seven parts, containing ten treatises each: three parts dealing with the preparation of the elixir from animal, vegetable, and mineral substances, respectively; two parts dealing with the four elements from a theoretical and practical point of view, respectively; one part focusing on the alchemical use of animal substances, and one part focusing on minerals and metals. It was translated into Latin by Gerard of Cremona (c. 1114–1187) under the title &quot;Liber de Septuaginta&quot;.
* Ten books added to the Seventy (&quot;ʿasharat kutub muḍāfa ilā l-sabʿīn&quot;, Kr. nos. 193–202): The sole surviving treatise from this small collection (&quot;The Book of Clarification&quot;, &quot;Kitāb al-Īḍāḥ&quot;, Kr. no. 195) briefly discusses the different methods for preparing the elixir, criticizing the philosophers who have only expounded the method of preparing the elixir starting from mineral substances, to the exclusion of vegetable and animal substances.
* The Ten Books of Rectifications (&quot;al-Muṣaḥḥaḥāt al-ʿashara&quot;, Kr. nos. 203–212): Relates the successive improvements (“rectifications”, &quot;muṣaḥḥaḥāt&quot;) brought to the art by such &#x27;alchemists&#x27; as &#x27;Pythagoras&#x27; (Kr. no. 203), &#x27;Socrates&#x27; (Kr. no. 204), &#x27;Plato&#x27; (Kr. no. 205), &#x27;Aristotle&#x27; (Kr. no. 206), &#x27;Archigenes&#x27; (Kr. nos. 207–208), &#x27;Homer&#x27; (Kr. no. 209), &#x27;Democritus&#x27; (Kr. no. 210), Ḥarbī al-Ḥimyarī (Kr. no. 211), and Jabir himself (Kr. no. 212). The only surviving treatise from this small collection (&quot;The Book of the Rectifications of Plato&quot;, &quot;Kitāb Muṣaḥḥaḥāt Iflāṭūn&quot;, Kr. no. 205) is divided into 90 chapters: 20 chapters on processes using only mercury, 10 chapters on processes using mercury and one additional &#x27;medicine&#x27; (&quot;dawāʾ&quot;), 30 chapters on processes using mercury and two additional &#x27;medicines&#x27;, and 30 chapters on processes using mercury and three additional &#x27;medicines&#x27;. All of these are preceded by an introduction describing the laboratory equipment mentioned in the treatise.
* The Twenty Books (&quot;al-Kutub al-ʿishrūn&quot;, Kr. nos. 213–232): Only one treatise (&quot;The Book of the Crystal&quot;, &quot;Kitāb al-Billawra&quot;, Kr. no. 220) and a long extract from another one (&quot;The Book of the Inner Consciousness&quot;, &quot;Kitāb al-Ḍamīr&quot;, Kr. no. 230) survive. &quot;The Book of the Inner Consciousness&quot; appears to deal with the subject of specific properties (&quot;khawāṣṣ&quot;) and with talismans (&quot;ṭilasmāt&quot;).
* The Seventeen Books (Kr. nos. 233–249); three treatises added to the Seventeen Books (Kr. nos. 250–252); thirty unnamed books (Kr. nos. 253–282); The Four Treatises and some related treatises (Kr. nos. 283–286, 287–292); The Ten Books According to the Opinion of Balīnās, the Master of Talismans (Kr. nos. 293–302): Of these, only three treatises appear to be extant, i.e., the &quot;Kitāb al-Mawāzīn&quot; (Kr. no. 242), the &quot;Kitāb al-Istiqṣāʾ&quot; (Kr. no. 248), and the &quot;Kitāb al-Kāmil&quot; (Kr. no. 291).
* The Books of the Balances (&quot;Kutub al-Mawāzīn&quot;, Kr. nos. 303–446): This collection appears to have consisted of 144 treatises of medium length, 79 of which are known by name and 44 of which are still extant. Though relatively independent from each other and devoted to a very wide range of topics (cosmology, grammar, music theory, medicine, logic, metaphysics, mathematics, astronomy, astrology, etc.), they all approach their subject matter from the perspective of &quot;the science of the balance&quot; (&quot;ʿilm al-mīzān&quot;, a theory which aims at reducing all phenomena to a system of measures and quantitative proportions). &quot;The Books of the Balances&quot; are also an important source for Jabir&#x27;s speculations regarding the apparition of the &quot;two brothers&quot; (&quot;al-akhawān&quot;), a doctrine which was later to become of great significance to the Egyptian alchemist Ibn Umayl (c. 900–960).
* The Five Hundred Books (&quot;al-Kutub al-Khamsumiʾa&quot;, Kr. nos. 447–946): Only 29 treatises in this collection are known by name, 15 of which are extant. Its contents appear to have been mainly religious in nature, with moral exhortations and alchemical allegories occupying an important place. Among the extant treatises, &quot;The Book of the Glorious&quot; (&quot;Kitāb al-Mājid&quot;, Kr. no. 706) and &quot;The Book of Explication&quot; (&quot;Kitāb al-Bayān&quot;, Kr. no. 785) are notable for containing some of the earliest preserved Shi&#x27;ite eschatological, soteriological and imamological doctrines. Intermittent extracts from &quot;The Book of Kingship&quot; (&quot;Kitāb al-Mulk&quot;, Kr. no. 454) exist in a Latin translation under the title &quot;Liber regni&quot;.
* The Books on the Seven Metals (Kr. nos. 947–956): Seven treatises which are closely related to &quot;The Books of the Balances&quot;, each one dealing with one of Jabir&#x27;s seven metals (respectively gold, silver, copper, iron, tin, lead, and &quot;khārṣīnī&quot; or &quot;chinese metal&quot;). In one manuscript, these are followed by the related three-part &quot;Book of Concision&quot; (&quot;Kitāb al-Ījāz&quot;, Kr. nos. 954–956).
* Diverse alchemical treatises (Kr. nos. 957–1149): In this category, Kraus placed a large number of named treatises which he could not with any confidence attribute to one of the alchemical collections of the corpus. According to Kraus, some of them may actually have been part of &quot;The Five Hundred Books&quot;.

=== Writings on magic (talismans, specific properties) ===
Among the surviving Jabirian treatises, there are also a number of relatively independent treatises dealing with &quot;the science of talismans&quot; (&quot;ʿilm al-ṭilasmāt&quot;, a form of theurgy) and with &quot;the science of specific properties&quot; (&quot;ʿilm al-khawāṣṣ&quot;, i.e., the science dealing with the hidden powers of mineral, vegetable and animal substances, and with their practical applications in medical and various other pursuits). These are:

* The Book of the Search (&quot;Kitāb al-Baḥth&quot;, also known as &quot;The Book of Extracts&quot;, &quot;Kitāb al-Nukhab&quot;, Kr. no. 1800): This long work deals with the philosophical foundations of theurgy or &quot;the science of talismans&quot; (&quot;ʿilm al-ṭilasmāt&quot;). It is also notable for citing a significant number of Greek authors: there are references to (the works of) Plato, Aristotle, Archimedes, Galen, Alexander of Aphrodisias, Porphyry, Themistius, (pseudo-)Apollonius of Tyana, and others.
* The Book of Fifty (&quot;Kitāb al-Khamsīn&quot;, perhaps identical to &quot;The Great Book on Talismans&quot;, &quot;Kitāb al-Ṭilasmāt al-kabīr&quot;, Kr. nos. 1825–1874): This work, only extracts of which are extant, deals with subjects such as the theoretical basis of theurgy, specific properties, astrology, and demonology.
* The Great Book on Specific Properties (&quot;Kitāb al-Khawāṣṣ al-kabīr&quot;, Kr. nos. 1900–1970): This is Jabir&#x27;s main work on &quot;the science of specific properties&quot; (&quot;ʿilm al-khawāṣṣ&quot;), i.e., the science dealing with the hidden powers of mineral, vegetable and animal substances, and with their practical applications in medical and various other pursuits. However, it also contains a number of chapters on &quot;the science of the balance&quot; (&quot;ʿilm al-mīzān&quot;, a theory which aims at reducing all phenomena to a system of measures and quantitative proportions).
* The Book of the King (&quot;Kitāb al-Malik&quot;, kr. no. 1985): Short treatise on the effectiveness of talismans.
* The Book of Black Magic (&quot;Kitāb al-Jafr al-aswad&quot;, Kr. no. 1996): This treatise is not mentioned in any other Jabirian work.

=== Other extant writings ===
Writings on a wide variety of other topics were also attributed to Jabir. Most of these are lost (see below), except for:

* The Book on Poisons and on the Repelling of their Harmful Effects (&quot;Kitāb al-Sumūm wa-dafʿ maḍārrihā&quot;, Kr. no. 2145): on pharmacology.
* The Book of Comprehensiveness (&quot;Kitāb al-Ishtimāl&quot;, Kr. no. 2715): a long extract of this philosophical treatise is preserved by the poet and alchemist al-Ṭughrāʾī (1061–c. 1121).

=== Lost writings ===
Although a significant number of the Jabirian treatises on alchemy and magic do survive, many of them are also lost. Apart from two surviving treatises (see immediately above), Jabir&#x27;s many writings on other topics are all lost:

* Catalogues (Kr. nos. 1–4): There are three catalogues which Jabir is said to have written of his own works (Kr. nos. 1–3), and one &quot;Book on the Order of Reading our Books&quot; (&quot;Kitāb Tartīb qirāʾat kutubinā&quot;, Kr. no. 4). They are all lost.
* The Books on Stratagems (&quot;Kutub al-Ḥiyal&quot;, Kr. nos. 1150–1449) and The Books on Military Stratagems and Tricks (&quot;Kutub al-Ḥiyal al-ḥurūbiyya wa-l-makāyid&quot;, Kr. nos. 1450–1749): Two large collections on &#x27;mechanical tricks&#x27; (the Arabic word &quot;ḥiyal&quot; translates Greek μηχαναί, &quot;mēchanai&quot;) and military engineering, both lost.
* Medical and pharmacological writings (Kr. nos. 2000–2499): Seven treatises are known by name, the only one extant being &quot;The Book on Poisons and on the Repelling of their Harmful Effects&quot; (&quot;Kitāb al-Sumūm wa-dafʿ maḍārrihā&quot;, Kr. no. 2145). Kraus also included into this category a lost treatise on zoology (&quot;The Book of Animals&quot;, &quot;Kitāb al-Ḥayawān&quot;, Kr. no. 2458) and a lost treatise on botany (&quot;The Book of Plants&quot; or &quot;The Book of Herbs&quot;, &quot;Kitāb al-Nabāt&quot; or &quot;Kitāb al-Ḥashāʾish&quot;, Kr. no. 2459).
* Philosophical writings (&quot;Kutub al-falsafa&quot;, Kr. nos. 2500–2799): Under this heading, Kraus mentioned 23 works, most of which appear to deal with Aristotelian philosophy (titles include, e.g., &quot;The Books of Logic According to the Opinion of Aristotle&quot;, Kr. no. 2580; &quot;The Book of Categories&quot;, Kr. no. 2582; &quot;The Book on Interpretation&quot;, Kr. no. 2583; &quot;The Book of Metaphysics&quot;, Kr. no. 2681; &quot;The Book of the Refutation of Aristotle in his Book On the Soul&quot;, Kr. no. 2734). Of one treatise (&quot;The Book of Comprehensiveness&quot;, &quot;Kitāb al-Ishtimāl&quot;, Kr. no. 2715) a long extract is preserved by the poet and alchemist al-Ṭughrāʾī (1061–c. 1121), but all other treatises in this group are lost.
* Mathematical, astronomical and astrological writings (Kr. nos. 2800–2899): Thirteen treatises in this category are known by name, all of which are lost. Notable titles include a &quot;Book of Commentary on Euclid&quot; (&quot;Kitāb Sharḥ Uqlīdiyas&quot;, Kr. no. 2813), a &quot;Commentary on the Book of the Weight of the Crown by Archimedes&quot; (&quot;Sharḥ kitāb wazn al-tāj li-Arshamīdas&quot;, Kr. no. 2821), a &quot;Book of Commentary on the Almagest&quot; (&quot;Kitāb Sharḥ al-Majisṭī&quot;, Kr. no. 2834), a &quot;Subtle Book on Astronomical Tables&quot; (&quot;Kitāb al-Zāj al-laṭīf&quot;, Kr. no. 2839), a &quot;Compendium on the Astrolabe from a Theoretical and Practical Point of View&quot; (&quot;Kitāb al-jāmiʿ fī l-asṭurlāb ʿilman wa-ʿamalan&quot;, Kr. no. 2845), and a &quot;Book of the Explanation of the Figures of the Zodiac and Their Activities&quot; (&quot;Kitāb Sharḥ ṣuwar al-burūj wa-afʿālihā&quot;, Kr. no. 2856).
* Religious writings (Kr. nos. 2900–3000): Apart from those known to belong to &quot;The Five Hundred Books&quot; (see above), there are a number of religious treatises whose exact place in the corpus is uncertain, all of which are lost. Notable titles include &quot;Books on the Shi&#x27;ite Schools of Thought&quot; (&quot;Kutub fī madhāhib al-shīʿa&quot;, Kr. no. 2914), &quot;Our Books on the Transmigration of the Soul&quot; (&quot;Kutubunā fī l-tanāsukh&quot;, Kr. no. 2947), &quot;The Book of the Imamate&quot; (&quot;Kitāb al-Imāma&quot;, Kr. no. 2958), and &quot;The Book in Which I Explained the Torah&quot; (&quot;Kitābī alladhī fassartu fīhi al-tawrāt&quot;, Kr. no. 2982).

== Historical background ==

=== Greco-Egyptian, Byzantine and Persian alchemy ===
The Jabirian writings contain a number of references to Greco-Egyptian alchemists such as pseudo-Democritus (fl. c. 60), Mary the Jewess (fl. c. 0–300), Agathodaemon (fl. c. 300), and Zosimos of Panopolis (fl. c. 300), as well as to legendary figures such as Hermes Trismegistus and Ostanes, and to scriptural figures such as Moses and Jesus (to whom a number of alchemical writings were also ascribed). However, these references may have been meant as an appeal to ancient authority rather than as an acknowledgement of any intellectual borrowing, and in any case Jabirian alchemy was very different from what is found in the extant Greek alchemical treatises: it was much more systematic and coherent, it made much less use of allegory and symbols, and a much more important place was occupied by philosophical speculations and their application to laboratory experiments. Furthermore, whereas Greek alchemical texts had been almost exclusively focused on the use of mineral substances (i.e., on &#x27;inorganic chemistry&#x27;), Jabirian alchemy pioneered the use of vegetable and animal substances, and so represented an innovative shift towards &#x27;organic chemistry&#x27;.

Nevertheless, there are some important theoretical similarities between Jabirian alchemy and contemporary Byzantine alchemy, and even though the Jabirian authors do not seem to have known Byzantine works that are extant today such as the alchemical works attributed to the Neoplatonic philosophers Olympiodorus (c. 495–570) and Stephanus of Alexandria (fl. c. 580–640), it seems that they were at least partly drawing on a parallel tradition of theoretical and philosophical alchemy. In any case, the writings actually used by the Jabirian authors appear to have mainly consisted of alchemical works falsely attributed to ancient philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Apollonius of Tyana, only some of which are still extant today, and whose philosophical content still needs to be determined.

One of the innovations in Jabirian alchemy was the addition of sal ammoniac (ammonium chloride) to the category of chemical substances known as &#x27;spirits&#x27; (i.e., strongly volatile substances). This included both naturally occurring sal ammoniac and synthetic ammonium chloride as produced from organic substances, and so the addition of sal ammoniac to the list of &#x27;spirits&#x27; is likely a product of the new focus on organic chemistry. Since the word for sal ammoniac used in the Jabirian corpus (&quot;nošāder&quot;) is Iranian in origin, it has been suggested that the direct precursors of Jabirian alchemy may have been active in the Hellenizing and Syriacizing schools of the Sassanid Empire.

== Chemical philosophy ==

=== Elements and natures ===
According to Aristotelian physics, each element is composed of two qualities: fire is hot and dry, earth is cold and dry, water is cold and moist, and air is hot and moist. In the Jabirian corpus, these qualities came to be called &quot;natures&quot; (Arabic: &quot;ṭabāʾiʿ&quot;), and elements are said to be composed of these &#x27;natures&#x27;, plus an underlying &quot;substance&quot; (&quot;jawhar&quot;). In metals two of these &#x27;natures&#x27; were interior and two were exterior. For example, lead was predominantly cold and dry and gold was predominantly hot and moist. Thus, Jabir theorized, by rearranging the natures of one metal, a different metal would result. Like Zosimos, Jabir believed this would require a catalyst, an &quot;al-iksir&quot;, the elusive elixir that would make this transformation possible – which in European alchemy became known as the philosopher&#x27;s stone.

=== The sulfur-mercury theory of metals ===

The sulfur-mercury theory of metals, though first attested in pseudo-Apollonius of Tyana&#x27;s &quot;The Secret of Creation&quot; (&quot;Sirr al-khalīqa&quot;, late 8th or early 9th century, but largely based on older sources), was also adopted by the Jabirian authors. According to the Jabirian version of this theory, metals form in the earth through the mixing of sulfur and mercury. Depending on the quality of the sulfur, different metals are formed, with gold being formed by the most subtle and well-balanced sulfur. This theory, which is ultimately based on ancient meteorological speculations such as those found in Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Meteorology&quot;, formed the basis of all theories of metallic composition until the 18th century.

<text>The Acorn Archimedes is a family of personal computers designed by Acorn Computers of Cambridge, England. The systems in this family use Acorn&#x27;s own ARM architecture processors and initially ran the Arthur operating system, with later models introducing RISC OS and, in a separate workstation range, RISC iX. The first Archimedes models were introduced in 1987, and systems in the Archimedes family were sold until the mid-1990s alongside Acorn&#x27;s newer Risc PC and A7000 models.

The first Archimedes models, featuring a 32-bit ARM2 RISC CPU running at 8 MHz, provided a significant upgrade from Acorn&#x27;s previous machines and 8-bit home computers in general. A performance rating of 4 MIPS was claimed in Acorn&#x27;s publicity for the Archimedes. Later models featured the ARM3 CPU, delivering a substantial performance improvement, and the first ARM system-on-a-chip, the ARM250.

The Archimedes preserves a degree of compatibility with Acorn&#x27;s earlier machines, offering BBC BASIC, support for running 8-bit applications, and display modes compatible with those earlier machines. Following on from Acorn&#x27;s involvement with the BBC Micro, two of the first models—the A305 and A310—were given the BBC branding.

The name &quot;Acorn Archimedes&quot; is commonly used to describe any of Acorn&#x27;s contemporary designs based on the same architecture. This architecture can be broadly characterised as involving the ARM CPU and the first generation chipset consisting of MEMC (MEMory Controller), VIDC (VIDeo and sound Controller) and IOC (Input Output Controller).

== History ==
Having introduced the BBC Micro in 1981, Acorn established itself as a major supplier to primary and secondary education in the United Kingdom. However, attempts to replicate this dominance in other sectors, such as home computing with the BBC Micro and Acorn Electron, and in other markets, including the United States and West Germany, were less successful.

As microprocessor and computing technology advanced in the early 1980s, microcomputer manufacturers had to consider evolving their product lines to offer increased capabilities and performance. Acorn&#x27;s strategy for business computing and the introduction of more capable machines involved a range of &quot;second processor&quot; expansions, including a Z80 second processor running the CP/M operating system, a commitment made by Acorn when securing the BBC Micro contract.

Meanwhile, established platforms like CP/M running on Z80 processors faced competition from the IBM PC running PC DOS and computers with a variety of operating systems on Intel processors such as the 8088 and 8086. Systems using the Motorola 68000 and other processors running the Unix operating system also became available. Apple launched the Lisa and Macintosh computers, and Digital Research introduced its own GEM graphical user interface software, building on previous work by Xerox.

Acorn&#x27;s strategy seemingly evolved to align with Torch Computers—a company that Acorn considered acquiring—which had already combined BBC Micro hardware with second processors (and modems) to produce their Communicator product line and derivatives. In 1984, Acorn introduced the Acorn Business Computer (ABC) range, based on the BBC Micro architecture, offering models with different second processors and capabilities to respond to computing trends at the time. These models received generally favorable reviews from the computing press. However, with Acorn facing financial strain due to various endeavors, the company was rescued by Olivetti in 1985, leaving the future of the ABC range uncertain in the expected restructuring process. Ultimately, only one of the variants—the Acorn Cambridge Workstation—would reach the market, in a somewhat different form than originally planned.

The demise of the Acorn Business Computer left Acorn purely with a range of 8-bit microcomputer products, leaving the company vulnerable to competitors introducing 16-bit and 32-bit machines. The increasing dominance of MS-DOS in the business market and advocacy for the use of such software in the education sector left Acorn at risk of potential exclusion from its core market. Meanwhile, competing machines attempted to offer a degree of compatibility with the BBC Micro, enticing schools to upgrade to newer, more powerful non-Acorn machines while retaining access to software developed and purchased for Acorn&#x27;s &quot;aging machine&quot;. Acorn&#x27;s ability to respond convincingly to these competitive threats was evidently constrained: the BBC Model B+ was merely a redesigned BBC Model B (with some heritage in the ABC endeavour) providing some extra memory but costing more than its predecessor, being labelled as a &quot;stop gap&quot; by Acorn User&#x27;s technical editor, expressing frustration at opportunities not taken for cost reduction and at a general lack of technological innovation in that &quot;Acorn has never shown interest in anything as exciting as the 68000&quot;. Disillusionment was sufficient for some software producers to signal a withdrawal from the Acorn market.

Other commentators in response to the B+ suggested that Acorn pursue the second processor strategy more aggressively, leveraging the existing user base of the BBC Micro while those users were still using the machine. In 1986, Acorn introduced the BBC Master series, starting with the Master 128 which re-emphasised second processors in the form of internally fitted &quot;co-processors&quot;. Although a modest evolution of the existing 6502-based platform, enthusiasm for the series was somewhat greater than that for the B+ models, with dealers and software developers citing the expansion capabilities and improved compatibility over the B+. However, the competitiveness of these co-processors proved to be constrained by hardware limitations, compatibility and pricing, with a Master 512 system featuring a Master 128 and 80186 co-processor comparing unfavourably to complete IBM PC-compatible systems. The planned Master Scientific product was never launched, leaving potential customers with the existing Cambridge Co-Processor expansion as their only available option.

Attitudes towards Acorn and its technological position changed somewhat in late 1985 as news of its RISC microprocessor development effort emerged, potentially encouraging Olivetti to continue its support for the company at &quot;a critical stage&quot; in its refinancing of Acorn. Subsequent commentary suggested the availability of this microprocessor—the Acorn RISC Machine—in future computers as well as in an evaluation board for the BBC Micro, although such a board—the ARM Evaluation System—would only be announced in mid-1986 at a cost of £4500. Having also developed the additional support chips required to make up a complete microcomputer, Acorn was regarded as having leapt ahead of its nearest competitors.

On the eve of the announcement of Acorn&#x27;s 32-bit ARM-based microcomputer products, prototypes designated A1 and A500 were demonstrated on the BBC television programme &quot;Micro Live&quot; exhibiting BASIC language performance ten times faster than a newly introduced 80386-based computer from perennial education sector rival Research Machines, with suggestions made that the machines would carry the BBC branding. Revealingly, Acorn&#x27;s managing director noted, &quot;Over the past two years we&#x27;ve paid the price of having no 16-bit micro.&quot;

== Models ==

The first available models in the family were the A305, A310 and A440, introduced in 1987, followed by the A3000, A410/1, A420/1 and A440/1 in 1989, A540 in 1990, A5000 in 1991, A4 in 1992, with the A3010, A3020 and A4000 being the final models, also introduced in 1992.

=== A300 and A400 series ===
Powered by an ARM2 (Acorn RISC Machine) processor, the Acorn Archimedes was variously described as &quot;the first RISC machine inexpensive enough for home use&quot;, and &quot;the first commercially-available RISC-based microcomputer&quot;. The first models were released in June 1987, as the 300 and 400 series. The 400 series included four expansion slots and an ST-506 controller for an internal hard drive, whereas the 300 series required the addition of a backplane to gain expansion slot capabilities. A two slot backplane could be added to the 300 series as an official upgrade, with the possibility of 4-slot backplane being available from third parties, but a hard drive expansion card was also required for these machines, occupying one slot.

Both series included the Arthur operating system (later replaced by RISC OS as a paid-for upgrade), BBC BASIC programming language, and an emulator for Acorn&#x27;s earlier BBC Micro, and were mounted in two-part cases with a small central unit, monitor on top, and a separate keyboard and three-button mouse (the middle one used for pop-up context menus of the operating system). All models featured eight-channel 8-bit stereo sound and were capable of displaying 256 colours on screen.

Three models were initially released with different amounts of memory, the A305, A310 and A440. The 400 series models were replaced in 1989 by the A410/1, the A420/1 and A440/1, these featuring an upgraded MEMC1a and RISC OS. Earlier models which shipped with Arthur could be upgraded to by replacing the ROM chip containing the operating system. Because the ROM chips contained the operating system, the computer booted instantly into its GUI system, familiar from the Atari ST.

Despite the A310 being limited to 1 MB of RAM officially, several companies made upgrades to 2 MB and 4 MB, with the smaller upgrades augmenting the built-in RAM and the larger upgrades replacing it entirely. The 400 series were officially limited to 4 MB of RAM, but several companies released 8 MB upgrades that provided an extra MEMC chip plus 4 MB of RAM to complement an existing 4 MB of fitted RAM.

=== A3000 ===


In early 1989, speculation about new machines in the Archimedes range envisaged a low-cost, cut-down model with 512 KB of RAM to replace the A305 in a fashion reminiscent of the Master Compact. This speculation evolved to more accurately predict a machine with 1 MB of RAM aimed at junior or primary schools. Other commentators correctly predicted the provision of an internal disc drive and a single &quot;special&quot; podule slot. However, any new, low-cost product providing support for up to 2 MB of RAM also raised questions about the future of the 300 series, given the limitation of the 300 series to a maximum of 1 MB at that time.

Concurrently with these rumoured product development efforts, work had commenced on a successor to the Arthur operating system, initially named Arthur 2 but renamed to RISC OS 2 for launch. In May 1989, a number of new machines were introduced along with RISC OS 2: the 300 series was phased out in favour of the new BBC A3000, and the 400 series were replaced by the improved 400/1 series models. Having been developed in a &quot;remarkably short timescale of nine months&quot;, the machine was the &quot;major learning vehicle&quot; for an integrated CAD system introduced at Acorn employing products from Valid Logic Systems, and it was reported that the A3000 was the first home microcomputer to use surface mount technology in its construction, with the machine being built at Acorn&#x27;s longstanding manufacturing partner, AB Electronics.

The A3000 used an 8 MHz ARM2 and was supplied with of RAM and RISC OS on of ROM. Unlike the previous models, the A3000 came in a single-part case similar to the BBC Micro, Amiga 500 and Atari ST computers, with the keyboard and disc drive integrated into a base unit &quot;slightly smaller than the Master 128&quot;. Despite the machine&#x27;s desktop footprint, being larger than a simple keyboard, the case was not designed to support a monitor. Acorn offered a monitor stand that attached to the machine, this being bundled with Acorn&#x27;s Learning Curve package, and PRES announced a monitor plinth and external disc drive case.

The new model sported only a single internal expansion slot, which was physically different from that of the earlier models, although electrically similar. An external connector could interface to existing expansion cards, with an external case for such cards being recommended and anticipated at the machine&#x27;s launch, and one such solution subsequently being provided by PRES&#x27;s expansion system. Acorn announced a combined user port and MIDI expansion for the internal slot at the machine&#x27;s launch, priced at £49. To enable the machine&#x27;s serial port, an upgrade costing £19 was required, and Econet support was also an optional extra.

Although only intended to be upgradeable to of RAM, third-party vendors offered upgrades to along with expansions offering additional disc drive connections and combinations of user and analogue ports, both of these helping those upgrading from Acorn&#x27;s 8-bit products, particularly in education, to make use of existing peripherals such as 5.25-inch drives, input devices and data logging equipment. Simtec Electronics even offered a RAM upgrade to 8 MB for the A3000 alongside other models. In 1996, IFEL announced a memory upgrade for the A3000 utilising a generic 72-pin SIMM module to provide 4 MB of RAM. Hard drive expansions based on ST506, SCSI and IDE technologies were also offered by a range of vendors.

With the &quot;British Broadcasting Corporation Computer System&quot; branding, the &quot;main market&quot; for the A3000 was schools and education authorities, and the educational price of £529—not considerably more expensive than the BBC Master—was considered to be competitive and persuasive in getting this particular audience to upgrade to Acorn&#x27;s 32-bit systems. The retail price of £649 plus VAT was considered an &quot;expensive alternative&quot; to the intended competition—the Commodore Amiga and Atari ST—but many times faster than similarly priced models of those ranges. The Amiga 500, it was noted, cost a &quot;not-so-bargain&quot; £550 once upgraded to of RAM.

The relative affordability of the A3000 compared to the first Archimedes machines and the release of RISC OS helped to convince educational software producers of the viability of the platform. Shortly after the A3000&#x27;s launch, one local education authority had already ordered 500 machines, aiming to introduce the A3000 to its primary schools in addition to other levels of education. Such was the success of the model that it alone had 37 percent of the UK schools market in a nine-month period in 1991 and, by the end of that year, was estimated to represent 15 percent of the 500,000 or more computers installed in the country&#x27;s schools.

The appeal of the A3000 to education may also have motivated the return of Microvitec to the Acorn market with the Cub3000 monitor: a re-engineered version of the Cub monitor that was popular amongst institutional users of the original BBC Micro. (Having been &quot;nowhere to be seen&quot; when the Archimedes was released, Microvitec had sought to introduce its own Cubpack range of IBM PC-compatible personal computers for the education market offering some BBC BASIC compatibility, building on an estimated 80 percent market share for 14-inch colour monitors in the sector, and aspiring to launch an &quot;interactive video workstation&quot;.)

The introduction of the A3000 also saw Acorn regaining a presence in mainstream retail channels, with a deal with high street retailer Dixons to sell the computer at &quot;business centre&quot; outlets, followed by agreements with the John Lewis and Alders chains. Acorn also sought to secure the interest of games publishers, hosting a conference in August 1989 for representatives of &quot;the top 30 software houses, including Ocean, Domark, US Gold, Grand Slam and Electronic Arts&quot;.

Marketing efforts towards home users continued in 1990 with the introduction of The Learning Curve: a bundle of A3000 and application software priced at £699 plus VAT, requiring a SCART capable television (and appropriate cable), or bundled with a colour monitor and Acorn&#x27;s monitor stand for £949 plus VAT. The software, having a retail value of around £200, consisted of the second, RISC OS compliant version of Acorn&#x27;s First Word Plus, the hypermedia application Genesis, and the PC Emulator software, with an introductory video presented by Fred Harris. Aiming at the &quot;pre-Christmas market&quot; in 1990, another bundle called Jet Set offered a more entertainment-focused collection of software valued at £200 including Clares&#x27; Interdictor flight simulator, Domark&#x27;s Trivial Pursuit, Superior Golf, and the Euclid 3D modelling package from Ace Computing. The price of this bundle was £747.50 which also included a television modulator developed by the bundle&#x27;s distributor, ZCL, designed for use with &quot;any TV set&quot; and offering a &quot;monitor quality&quot; picture.

Pre-launch speculation for the A3000 had suggested the inclusion of a TV modulator and a possible price of £399 for a 512 KB &quot;Archimedes 205&quot; machine aimed at the home market. Rumours about the integration of various elements of Acorn&#x27;s chipset—specifically, MEMC and VIDC—to &quot;do an Electron&quot; were regarded as logistically demanding and thus unlikely to reduce cost. Such increased integration and targeting of the home market was later pursued with the introduction of the A3010 in 1992.

=== A540 ===
The A540, introduced in late 1990, was an anticipated consequence of Acorn&#x27;s Unix workstation development, offering the same general specification as Acorn&#x27;s R260 Unix workstation (running RISC iX) but without built-in Ethernet support and running RISC OS 2 instead of Unix. It was Acorn&#x27;s first machine to be fitted with the ARM3 processor as standard, supporting up to 16 MB of RAM, and included higher speed SCSI and provision for connecting genlock devices. The memory access frequency was raised to 12 MHz in the A540, compared to 8 MHz in earlier models, thus providing enhanced system performance over earlier models upgraded with ARM3 processors. The hardware design featured memory modules, each providing their own memory controller and 4 MB of RAM, and a processor module providing the ARM3 and a slot for a floating point accelerator (FPA) chip, the latter offering the possibility (subsequently unrealised) of processor upgrades. The FPA, replacing Acorn&#x27;s previous floating point podule, was scheduled to be available in 1991. Much delayed, the FPA finally became available in 1993.

===A5000 and A4 laptop===

In late 1991, the A5000 was launched to replace the A440/1 machine in the existing product range. With the existing A400/1 series regarded as &quot;a little tired&quot;, being largely unchanged from the A400 models introduced four years previously, the A5000 was regarded (by one reviewer, at least) as &quot;the biggest leap forward for Acorn since the introduction of the Archimedes in 1987&quot;, introducing a combination of the ARM3 processor and RISC OS 3 for the first time in a new Acorn product, being &quot;the machine the A540 should have been - smaller, neater, with higher capacity drives and all the same speed for about half the cost&quot;. The A5000 initially ran RISC OS 3.0, although several bugs were identified, and most were shipped with RISC OS 3.10 or 3.11.

The A5000 featured the new 25 MHz ARM3 processor, 2 or 4 MB of RAM, either a 40 MB or an 80 MB hard drive and a more conventional pizza box-style two-part case. With IBM-compatible PCs offering increasingly better graphical capabilities, they had not merely matched the capabilities of Acorn&#x27;s machines, but in offering resolutions of in 16 or 256 colours and with 24-bit palettes, they had surpassed them. The A5000 (along with the earlier A540) supported the SVGA resolution of in 16 colours, although the observation that &quot;Archimedes machines have simply not kept pace&quot; arguably remained. Earlier models could also benefit from the video performance of the A5000 via third party upgrades such as the Computer Concepts ColourCard Gold. The A5000 was the first Acorn machine to adopt the 15-pin VGA connector.

It was the first Archimedes to feature a high density capable floppy disc drive as standard. This natively supported various formats including DOS and Atari discs with formatted capacities of 720 KB and 1.44 MB. The native ADFS floppy format had a slightly larger capacity of 800 KB for double density or 1.6 MB for high density. A later version of the A5000 featured a 33 MHz ARM3, 2 or 4 MB of RAM, and an 80 or 160 MB hard drive. Particularly useful in this revised A5000 was the use of a socket for the MEMC1a chip, meaning that memory expansions beyond 4 MB could more easily replace the single MEMC1a, plugging in a card providing the two MEMC1a devices required to support 8 MB. Earlier revisions of the A5000 required desoldering of the fitted MEMC1a to provide such a socket.
In 1992, Acorn introduced the A4 laptop computer featuring a slower 24 MHz version of the ARM3 processor (compared to the 25 MHz ARM3 in the A5000), supporting a 6 MHz power-saving mode, and providing between 2.5 and 4 hours of usage on battery power. The machine featured a 9-inch passive matrix LCD screen capable of displaying a maximum resolution of in 15 levels of grey, also featuring a monitor port which offered the same display capabilities as an A5000. No colour version of the product was planned. A notable omission from the machine was a built-in pointing device, requiring users to navigate with the cursor keys or attach a conventional Acorn three-button mouse, such as the Logitech mouse bundled with the machine.

The other expansion ports available on the A4 were serial and parallel ports, a PS/2 connector for an external keyboard, a headphone connector, and support for an Econet expansion (as opposed to an Econet port itself). No other provision for expansion was made beyond the fitting of the Econet card and a hard drive. The A4 effectively fit an A5000 into a portable case, having a motherboard &quot;roughly half the size of a sheet of A4 paper&quot;, adding extra hardware for power management and driving the LCD, the latter employing an Acorn-designed controller chip using &quot;time-domain dithering&quot; to produce the different grey levels. Just as the processor could be slowed down to save power, so the 12 MHz RAM could be slowed to 3 MHz, with various subsystems also being switched off as appropriate, and with power saving being activated after &quot;more than a second or so&quot; of user inactivity. The A4&#x27;s case itself was used by Olivetti and Triumph-Adler models, particularly the Triumph-Adler Walkstation which did integrate a built-in pointing device, this being described as an &quot;all-but-unusable touchpad mouse-controller&quot; by one reviewer.

The launch pricing of the A4 set the entry-level model with 2 MB of RAM at £1399 plus VAT, with the higher-level mode with 4 MB of RAM and 60 MB hard drive at £1699 plus VAT. Education pricing was £1099 and £1399 respectively. Acorn foresaw educational establishments taking to the machine where existing models were needing to be moved around between classrooms or taken on field trips, although review commentary noted that &quot;the A4 is too expensive for schools to afford in large numbers&quot; and that contemporary Apple and IBM PC-compatible models offered strong competition for business users.

Peripherals for the A4 were eventually produced, with Acorn providing the previously announced Econet card, and with Atomwide providing Ethernet and SCSI adapters utilising the bidirectional parallel port present on the A4 (and also the A5000 and later machines). Atomwide also offered the &quot;Hi-Point&quot; trackball peripheral modified to work as an Acorn-compatible mouse which attached to the side of the unit.

=== A3010, A3020, A4000 ===

In 1992, several new models were introduced to complement the A3000 and to replace the low-end A400 series models: the A3010, A3020 and A4000. Launched alongside the Acorn Pocket Book, a distinct product based on the Psion Series 3, the machines supposedly heralded &quot;a changed company, with new direction&quot; and the availability of Acorn products in mainstream high street stores including Dixons, John Lewis and Argos as well as mail order catalogues. Thus, a transition had begun from a range of machines of different vintages that still included the A3000 (at the low end) and the A540 (at the high end) to a range that purely featured more recently designed models including the A5000 as the high-end offering and the A4 portable.

These new models utilised the first ARM system-on-a-chip—the ARM250 microprocessor—a single-chip design including the functionality of an ARM2 (or ARM3 without cache), the IOC1, VIDC1a and MEMC1a chips all &quot;integrated into a single giant chip&quot; and fabricated using a 1 micron process. The ARM250, running at a higher 12 MHz clock frequency and used in conjunction with faster 80ns memory chips, compared to the 8 MHz of the ARM2 and the 125ns memory of the A3000, gave a potential 50% performance increase over such older systems, achieving a reported 7 MIPS.

Some early units of the A3010 did not actually utilise the ARM250, instead having a &quot;mezzanine&quot; board carrying the four separate devices comprising the complete chipset, with this board plugged into the motherboard in place of the ARM250. An Acorn representative indicated that this solution was pursued to meet retailing deadlines, whereas an ARM representative denied that any &quot;serious delays&quot; had occurred in the development of the ARM250, indicating that the mezzanine board had nevertheless been useful during the design process. Owners did not need to upgrade this board to a genuine ARM250 as it was &quot;functionally identical&quot; to the ARM250. One inadvertent advantage that the mezzanine board conferred was the ability to upgrade the ARM2 on the board to an ARM3, this being a popular upgrade for previous ARM2-based models that was incompatible with the ARM250. However, performing such an upgrade involves modifications to both the &quot;Adelaide&quot; mezzanine board and the ARM3 upgrade board employed in the upgrade. For machines fitted with an actual ARM250 processor, the closest alternative to an ARM3 upgrade in terms of performance enhancement was the Simtec &quot;Turbo RAM&quot; upgrade which provided 4 MB of faster RAM and gave a 40 percent improvement in overall system performance.

The machines were supplied with RISC OS 3.10 or 3.11. The A30x0 series had a one-piece design, similar to the A3000 but slightly more shallow, while the A4000 looked like a slightly slimmer A5000. The A3010 model was intended to be a home computing machine, featuring a TV modulator (for use with traditional PAL-standard televisions, SCART televisions already being supported by all of these models) and standard 9-pin joystick ports, while the A3020 targeted the primary and middle school educational markets, featuring an optional built-in 2.5-inch hard drive and a dedicated network interface socket, both capabilities being provided without requiring the machine&#x27;s &quot;mini-podule&quot; expansion slot. Meanwhile, the A4000 was aimed at the secondary education and office markets, offering a separate adjustable keyboard to comply with ergonomics regulations deemed applicable in these markets. Technically, the A4000 was almost functionally identical to the A3020, only differing in the supported hard disk size (3.5-inch in the A4000), this due to the machine&#x27;s different casing. Despite the resemblance to the A5000, the A4000 along with the other models only provided a single &quot;mini-podule&quot; expansion slot, just as the A3000 did. All three ARM250-based machines could be upgraded to 4 MB with plug-in chips: though the A3010 was designed for 2 MB, third party upgrades overcame this. In 1996, IFEL announced a memory upgrade for the range utilising a generic 72-pin SIMM module to provide 4 MB of RAM.

Pricing started at just under £500 including VAT for the Family Solution bundle: an unexpanded A3010 with no monitor (to be used with a television), combined with the EasiWord word processor and one game (initially Quest for Gold). The existing Learning Curve bundle, updated to incorporate the A3010 upgraded to 2 MB of RAM in place of the A3000, included an Acorn colour monitor, the PC Emulator and a suite of Genesis hypermedia applications for a price of £799. The A4000 Home Office bundle combined the A4000 with Acorn colour monitor, Icon Technology&#x27;s EasiWriter 2 &quot;professional word processor&quot; and Iota&#x27;s Desktop Database application for a price of around £1175. The retail pricing of the A3010 was notable as making it the cheapest of any Archimedes machine sold. With games consoles gaining popularity, Acorn apparently attempted to target the &quot;games machine plus&quot; market with the A3010 by appealing to &quot;the more knowledgeable, sophisticated and educationally concerned parents&quot;, this against a backdrop of established competing products having been heavily discounted: the Amiga 500 having been reduced to £299, for instance. In 1993, Commodore would subsequently offer the entry-level Amiga 600 at a price of only £199, although with Commodore &quot;losing money on a big scale&quot; while Acorn remained profitable, such discounting was not regarded as a threat to the A3010.

The pricing and bundles involving these machines was updated in late 1993, introducing a new Action Pack in place of the Family Solution, featuring the game Zool plus Icon Technology&#x27;s StartWrite word processor. This bundle effectively reduced the price of the A3010 to £399 including VAT, reportedly making it &quot;the cheapest Risc machine yet&quot;. The Learning Curve was revised to feature Acorn&#x27;s own Advance integrated suite, together with the PC Emulator and DR DOS 6, and the bundle was also made available in conjunction with the A4000. The Home Office bundle was updated with Iota&#x27;s DataPower replacing Desktop Database, and with Colton Software&#x27;s PipeDream 4 and Acorn&#x27;s PC Emulator being added to augment EasiWriter.
A variety of demonstration programs and an audio training tape were also provided with the bundles. At the time of these product revisions, the A3020 had become absent from related promotional material, even material aimed at the educational purchaser, although it remained in Acorn&#x27;s price list presumably for the interest of institutional purchasers.

Acorn&#x27;s marketing relationships with high street retailers were somewhat problematic. While outlets such as the John Lewis Partnership proved to be successful marketing partners, electrical retailer Dixons seemingly made relatively little effort to sell Acorn machines despite promising &quot;greater opportunities&quot; in 1993 after earlier criticism. In late 1994, Acorn appointed a sole distributor for the A3010 Action Pack and Learning Curve bundles, with the pricing of the former reduced to only £299. Persisting with the strategy that some purchasers might choose a product positioned between games consoles and traditional PC-compatibles, the distributor, ZCL, aimed to take advantage of the absence of Commodore during the Christmas 1994 season. As the Christmas 1995 season approached, Beebug purchased Acorn&#x27;s &quot;entire remaining inventory&quot;, offering the machine for £135 including VAT together with various &quot;value-added packs&quot;.

Production of the A3020 and A4000 ceased in 1995, with remaining stocks to be sold during 1996, due to their lack of conformance with newly introduced European Union electrical and electronics regulations. This left the A7000 as Acorn&#x27;s entry-level desktop system, and appropriate pricing adjustments were expected, particularly as faster versions of the A7000 were anticipated (and eventually delivered in the form of the A7000+).

=== Later A-series models ===
The &quot;A7000&quot;, despite its name being reminiscent of the Archimedes naming conventions, was actually more similar to the Risc PC, the line of RISC OS computers that succeeded the Archimedes in 1994. It lacked, however, the DEBI expansion slots and multi-slice case that characterized the Risc PC (though by removing the CDROM, a backplane with one slot could be fitted).

=== List of models ===
Also produced, but never sold commercially were:

* A500: 4 MB RAM, ST506 interface, Archimedes development machine
* A680 and M4: 8 MB RAM, SCSI on motherboard, RISC iX development machines

== Software ==

=== Arthur operating system ===

Reminiscent of the BBC Micro upon its release, the earliest Archimedes models were delivered with provisional versions of the Arthur operating system, for which upgrades were apparently issued free of charge, thus avoiding the controversy around early ROM upgrades for the BBC Micro. In early 1988, Arthur 1.2 was delivered in an attempt to fix the deficiencies and problems in the earlier versions of the software. However, even after Arthur 1.2 had been released, a reported 100 documented bugs regarded as &quot;mostly quite obscure&quot; persisted, with Acorn indicating that a &quot;new, enhanced version&quot; of the operating system was under development.

=== Early applications ===

Following on from the release of Arthur 1.2, Acorn itself offered a &quot;basic word processor&quot;, ArcWriter, intended for &quot;personal correspondence, notices and short articles&quot; and to demonstrate the window, menu and pointer features of the system, employing built-in printer fonts for rapid printed output. The software was issued free of charge for registered users, although Acorn indicated that it would not produce a &quot;definitive&quot; word processor for the platform, in contrast to the BBC Micro where the View word processor had been central to Acorn&#x27;s office software range. However, Acorn did also announce a port of the 1st Word package, First Word Plus, for the platform. ArcWriter was poorly received, with window repainting issues demonstrated as a particular problem, and with users complaining of &quot;serious bugs&quot;. Although taking advantage of the Arthur desktop environment and using anti-aliased fonts, complaints were made about &quot;blurred and smudged&quot; characters and slow display updates when changing fonts or styles on low-memory machines like the A305. An early competitor, Graphic Writer, was received more favourably but provided its own full-screen user interface. Neither were regarded as competitive with established products on other platforms.

Several software companies immediately promised software for the Archimedes, most notably Computer Concepts, Clares and Minerva, with Advanced Memory Systems, BBC Soft and Logotron being other familiar software publishers. Autodesk, Grafox and GST were newcomers to the Acorn market. However, in early 1988, many software developers were reportedly holding off on releasing software for the Archimedes until the release of a stable operating system, with Acorn offering to lend Arthur 1.2 to developers. Claims had been made of confusion amongst potential purchasers of the machine caused by the lack of available software, with Acorn having pursued a strategy of launching the machine first so that independent software developers might have hardware to work with. In order to make the Archimedes more attractive to certain sectors, Acorn announced a £250,000 investment in educational software and indicated a commitment to business software development. Alongside First Word Plus, the Logistix spreadsheet-based business planning package was also commissioned by Acorn from Grafox Limited as a port to the platform. Autodesk released AutoSketch for the Archimedes in 1988, having launched the product in March the same year. Priced at £79 plus VAT, it offered the precision drawing functionality familiar from AutoCad but with &quot;none of the frills&quot; that made the latter product professionally suitable for various markets at pricing that could exceed £2500. On the Archimedes, AutoSketch was reported to run at about five times the speed of a &quot;standard PC-compatible machine&quot;.

Although Acorn had restricted itself to supporting the use of its View word processor under BBC emulation on the Archimedes, View Professional—the final iteration of the View suite on Acorn&#x27;s 8-bit computers—had been advertised as a future product in June 1987 for November availability. View Professional, like the View series, had been developed for Acorn by Mark Colton, and a company—Colton Software—delivered the successor to this product as PipeDream for the Cambridge Computer Z88. In mid-1988, Colton Software announced PipeDream for the Archimedes, priced at £114, following on from the announcement of a version for MS-DOS, establishing a long history of product development for the platform, leading to PipeDream 4 in 1992, followed by PipeDream&#x27;s eventual successor, Fireworkz, in 1994.

Much early software had consisted of titles converted from the BBC Micro, taking advantage of a degree of compatibility between the different series of machines, with Computer Concepts even going as far as to produce a ROM/RAM hardware expansion for use with the company&#x27;s existing BBC Micro series products, and Acorn also offering such an expansion alongside a BBC-compatible interfacing expansion. Another element of Acorn&#x27;s early marketing strategy for the Archimedes was to emphasise the PC Emulator product which was a software-based emulator for IBM PC-compatible systems based on the 8088 processor running &quot;legal MS-DOS programs&quot;. Alongside this, plans were also made for the launch of a podule (peripheral module) hardware expansion providing its own 80186 processor, a disk controller and connector for a disk drive.

The PC Emulator in its initial form shipped with MS-DOS 3.21 and required a system with 4 MB of RAM to be able to provide the &quot;full&quot; 640 KB of RAM for DOS programs, with early versions of Arthur only providing 384 KB to DOS on 1 MB systems, but with Arthur 1.2 aiming to provide the more usable 512 KB to DOS on such systems. The emulator was described as having &quot;very few compatibility problems&quot; and was reported by diagnostic utilities as providing an 80188-based system, but the performance of the emulated system was regarded as slow. Acorn reportedly acknowledged this by indicating the imminent availability of &quot;an 80186 co-processor&quot;. The podule expansion (or &quot;co-processor&quot;) was subsequently postponed in early 1988 (and ultimately cancelled), with Acorn indicating that its price of £300 would have been uncompetitive against complete PC systems costing as little as £500, and that the hardware capabilities to be offered, such as the provision of CGA graphics, would be likely to become outdated as the industry moved to support EGA and VGA graphical standards.

Commentators were disappointed with the incoherent user interface provided by the software platform, with &quot;Logistix looking like a PC, First Word slavishly copying GEM&quot; and &quot;101 other &#x27;user interfaces&#x27;&quot; amongst the early offerings. The result was the lack of a &quot;personality&quot; for the machine which risked becoming a system that would &quot;never look as easy or as slick as the Mac&quot;. Alongside the introduction of visual and behavioural consistency between applications, personal computer user environments had also evolved from running a single application at a time, moved beyond &quot;desk accessories&quot; (or pop-up programs), normalised the practice of switching between applications, and had begun to provide the ability to run different applications at the same time, with the Macintosh having already done so with its MultiFinder enhancement. Computer Concepts, having begun development of various new applications for the Archimedes, was sufficiently frustrated with Arthur and its lack of &quot;true multi-tasking&quot; that it announced a rival operating system, Impulse, intended to host those applications on the machine.

=== RISC OS ===

Remedying various criticisms of the early operating environment, Acorn previewed RISC OS (or, more formally, RISC OS 2) in late 1988 and announced availability for April 1989. Internally at Acorn, the realisation had dawned that multitasking had become essential in any mainstream computing environment where &quot;the user is likely to use lots of small applications at once, rather than one large application alone&quot;, with other graphical environments such as Hewlett Packard&#x27;s NewWave and IBM&#x27;s Presentation Manager being considered as the contemporary competition.

Reactions to the upgraded operating system were positive and even enthusiastic, describing RISC OS as giving software developers &quot;the stable platform they have been waiting for&quot; and &quot;a viable alternative to the PC or Mac&quot;, also crediting Acorn for having improved on the original nine-month effort in developing Arthur in the following twelve months leading up to the unveiling of RISC OS. For a modest upgrade cost of £29, users received four ROM chips, three discs including several applications, and documentation.

New facilities in RISC OS included co-operative multitasking, a task manager to monitor tasks and memory, versatile file management, &quot;solid&quot; window manipulation (&quot;the whole window moves - not just the outline&quot;), and adaptive rendering of bitmaps and colours, using dithering where necessary, depending on the nature of the selected screen mode. A common printing framework was introduced, with dot-matrix and PostScript printer drivers supplied, with such drivers available for use by all desktop applications. Amongst the selection of applications and tools included with RISC OS were the Draw graphics editor, featuring vector graphics editing and rudimentary manipulation of text (using the anti-aliased fonts familiar from Arthur) and bitmaps, the Edit text editor, the Paint bitmap editor, and the Maestro music editor.

With RISC OS available, Acorn launched new and updated applications to take advantage of the improved desktop environment. One of these, deferred until after the launch of RISC OS, was Acorn Desktop Publisher, a port of Timeworks Publisher, which introduced a significant improvement to the anti-aliased font capabilities through a new outline font manager, offering scalable fonts that were anti-aliased on screen but rendered at the appropriate resolution when printed, even on dot-matrix printers. First Word Plus was also updated to support the new RISC OS desktop environment, albeit retaining its own printer drivers, being positioned as complementing Acorn Desktop Publisher whose emphasis was on page layout as opposed to textual document creation.

As part of an effort to grow the company&#x27;s share of the home market, Acorn introduced a bundle called The Learning Curve, initially featuring the A3000, optional monitor and a set of applications (First Word Plus, the PC Emulator, and Genesis). This bundle was enhanced later in 1990 to attract buyers to the A420/1, adding Acorn Desktop Publisher and some additional Genesis applications. Acorn&#x27;s document processing applications also began to see broader competition around this time, with Impression from Computer Concepts and Ovation from Beebug also providing competitive solutions for desktop publishing. Also in 1990, PipeDream 3 became the first version of the PipeDream integrated suite, descended from Acorn&#x27;s View Professional but developed and marketed by Colton Software, to be made available for the RISC OS desktop.

The launch of the A5000 in late 1991 brought a new version of RISC OS to the market: RISC OS 3. This delivered a range of enhancements to the operating system including multitasking filer operations (meaning that file copying, moving and deletion no longer took over the computer), support for reading and writing DOS format discs, the provision of various bundled applications (Alarm, Calc, Chars, Configure, Draw, Edit, Help and Paint), commonly used outline fonts, and software modules in ROM (instead of needing to be loaded from accompanying floppy discs into RAM), the removal or raising of limits on windows and tasks, the ability to &quot;iconise&quot; windows and pin them to the desktop background (or pinboard), desktop session saving and restoring, screen blanking support, and other printing and networking improvements. Providing the bundled applications and other resources in ROM saved an estimated 150 KB of workspace, thus being beneficial to users of 1 MB machines.

The bundled RISC OS 3 applications were enhanced from their RISC OS 2 versions in various general ways, such as the introduction of keyboard shortcuts, but also with new, specific features. The printing system was also updated to support multiple printers at once, but in this first version of RISC OS 3 background printing was still not supported. The &quot;most obviously improved&quot; application was Draw, acquiring new features including multiple levels of &quot;undo&quot; and &quot;redo&quot; operations, rotated text (benefiting from an updated outline font manager), graduated fills, shape interpolation (or in-betweening) support, and built-in support for converting text into paths. Edit gained improved formatting and searching support plus transparent BASIC program editing facilities. One somewhat visually obvious improvement delivered in RISC OS 3 was the use of &quot;3D window borders&quot; or, more accurately, dedicated bitmaps for window furniture, allowing different desktop styling effects. The appearance of the desktop would eventually shift towards Acorn&#x27;s &quot;NewLook&quot; desktop theme, previewed in late 1993.

In late 1992, RISC OS 3 was itself updated, becoming RISC OS 3.1 (as opposed to the initial RISC OS 3.0 provided with the A5000) and being made available for all existing Archimedes machines, although A300 series and the original A400 series machines needed a hardware modification to be able to accept the larger 2 MB ROMs, employing a special daughterboard. Various bugs in RISC OS 3.0 were fixed and various other improvements made, making it a worthwhile upgrade for A5000 users. Notably, support for background printing was introduced. VAT-inclusive introductory pricing for the upgrade was £19 for RISC OS 3.0 users and £49 for RISC OS 2.0 users, with the upgrade package including ROMs, support discs and manuals. The non-introductory price of the upgrade was stated as being £89.

The limitations of RISC OS became steadily more apparent, particularly with the appearance of the Risc PC and the demands made on applications taking advantage of its improved hardware capabilities (although merely highlighting issues that were always present), and when contrasted with the gradually evolving Windows and Macintosh System software, these competitors offering or promising new features and usability improvements over their predecessors. Two fundamental deficiencies perceived with RISC OS were a lack of virtual memory support, this permitting larger volumes of data to be handled by using hard disc storage as &quot;slow, auxiliary RAM&quot; (attempted by application-level solutions in certain cases), and the use of cooperative multitasking as opposed to preemptive multitasking to allow multiple applications to run at the same time, with the former relying on applications functioning correctly and considerately, and with the latter putting the system in control of allocating time to applications and thus preventing faulty or inconsiderate applications from hanging or dominating the system. Problems with the storage management and filing systems were also identified. In 1994, the FileCore functionality in RISC OS was still limited to accessing 512 MB of any hard drive, with this being barely larger than the largest supplied Risc PC hard drive at the time. Filing system limitations were also increasingly archaic: 77 files per directory and 10-character filenames, in contrast to more generous constraints imposed by the then-&quot;imminent&quot; Windows 95 and then-current Macintosh System 7 release.

Although an update to the FileCore functionality was delivered in 1995, initially to members of Acorn&#x27;s enthusiast community, providing support for larger storage partitions (raising the limit to 128 GB), other improvements, such as those providing support for the use of longer filenames, were still only provided by third parties. With adverse financial results and a restructuring of the company in late 1995, Acorn appeared to be considering a more responsive strategy towards customer demands, potentially offering rebadged PC and Mac products alongside Acorn&#x27;s existing computers, while cultivating a relationship with IBM whose PowerPC-based server hardware had already been featured in Acorn&#x27;s SchoolServer product running Windows NT. In the context of such a relationship, the possibility was raised of &quot;bolting a RISC OS &#x27;personality&#x27; on top of a low level IBM-developed operating system&quot; to address RISC OS&#x27;s deficiencies and to support virtual memory and long filenames. At this time, IBM was pursuing its Workplace OS strategy which emphasised a common operating system foundation supporting different system personalities.

=== PC Emulation ===

In mid-1991, the PC Emulator was eventually updated to work as a multitasking application on the RISC OS desktop, requiring 2 MB of RAM to do so, and supporting access to DOS files from the RISC OS desktop filer interface. The emulator itself permitted access to CD-ROM devices and ran MS-DOS 3.3 with a special mouse driver to permit the host machine&#x27;s mouse to behave like a Microsoft bus mouse. CGA, EGA, MDA and partial VGA graphics support was implemented, and the emulated system could run Windows 3. The product cost £99, with an upgrade costing £29 for users of previous versions. Although technically compatible with 1 MB systems, and with 2 MB of RAM considered necessary for multitasking operation, offering facilities to capture the emulated display as a bitmap or as text, 4 MB was recommended to take advantage of such features, along with a high resolution multiscan monitor and VIDC enhancer to be able to display most of the emulated screen without needing to scroll its contents. An ARM3 processor was considered essential for &quot;a workable turn of speed&quot;, this giving performance comparable with a 4.77 MHz 8086 PC-XT system.

Regarded as a &quot;programming wonder&quot;, the PC Emulator was nevertheless regarded as being &quot;too slow for intensive PC use&quot;. Shortly after the introduction of the updated PC Emulator, a hardware PC compatibility solution was announced by Aleph One, offering a 20 MHz 80386SX processor and VGA display capability, effectively delivering Acorn&#x27;s envisaged PC podule in updated form. A low-cost alternative to Acorn&#x27;s PC Emulator called FasterPC became available in 1993, priced at around £20 but with DOS not included (to be provided by the user at an estimated additional cost of £50). The software provided PC emulation outside the desktop environment, with considerable performance benefits claimed relative to Acorn&#x27;s product. Regarded as being &quot;considerably faster than the Acorn emulator when displaying graphics&quot;, with a two-times speed improvement observed for various tested programs, the product was considered appropriate for gaming, albeit at lower than VGA resolution. It was also unable to run Windows 3.1: the Aleph One PC expansion cards being the only solutions able to do so at that time.

=== Bitmap image editing ===

Having considerably improved graphical capabilities compared to those provided with Acorn&#x27;s 8-bit machines, a number of art packages were released for the Archimedes to exploit this particular area of opportunity, albeit rather cautiously at first. One of the first available packages, Clares&#x27; Artisan, supported image editing at the high resolution of but only in the 16-colour mode 12, despite the availability of the 256-colour mode 15 as standard. Favourably received as being &quot;streets ahead&quot; of art software on the BBC Micro, it was considered as barely the start of any real exploitation of the machine&#x27;s potential. Typical of software of the era, only months after the launch of the machine, Artisan provided its own graphical interface and, continuing the tradition of BBC Micro software, took over the machine entirely even to the point of editing the machine configuration and restoring it upon exiting. Clares released a successor, Artisan 2, two years later to provide compatibility with RISC OS, replacing special-purpose printer support with use of the system&#x27;s printer drivers, but not making the software a desktop application. The program&#x27;s user interface deficiencies were regarded as less forgivable with the availability of a common desktop interface that would have addressed such problems and made the program &quot;easier to use and a more powerful program as a result&quot;.

Clares also produced a 256-colour package called ProArtisan, also with its own special user interface (despite the impending arrival of RISC OS), costing considerably more than its predecessor (£170, compared to £40 for Artisan), offering a wider range of tools than Artisan including sprays, washes and path editing (using Bézier curves) to define areas of the canvas. Although regarded as powerful, the pricing was considered rather high from the perspective of those more familiar with the 8-bit software market, and the user interface was regarded as &quot;only just bearable&quot;. Competitors to ProArtisan during 1989 included Art Nouveau from Computer Assisted Learning and Atelier from Minerva. Both of these programs, like ProArtisan, ran in full-screen mode outside the desktop, used the 256-colour mode 15, and offered their own interfaces. Atelier, however, was able to multi-task, providing the ability to switch back to the desktop and find applications still running and accessible. Unlike other contemporary art programs, it also took advantage of the system&#x27;s own anti-aliased fonts. One unusual feature was the ability to wrap areas of the canvas around solid objects. Both programs also offered similar path editing facilities to ProArtisan, with it being noted that Art Nouveau&#x27;s limitations in this regard might be remedied by using the support already present in RISC OS and provided by the Draw application functionality, as ProArtisan 2 eventually demonstrated.

In 1989, RISC OS was provided with the Paint application on one of the accompanying application discs. It featured a multi-document, desktop-based interface with a range of elementary painting and drawing tools, also allowing images to be created in arbitrary sizes for any of the display modes, even permitting editing of images in display modes with different numbers of colours, albeit with limitations in the representation of image colours when the desktop mode had fewer colours available. Along with its companion applications, Paint supported the system&#x27;s anti-aliased fonts and printer driver framework, and by embracing the system&#x27;s user interface conventions, images could be exported directly to applications such as Draw by dragging an image&#x27;s file icon from the save dialogue directly to the target application.

Despite a trend of gradual adoption of desktop functionality, in 1990, Arcol from ExpLAN offered a single-tasking, full-screen, 256-colour editing experience using the lower resolution mode 13, supporting only bitmap fonts. Aimed at educational users, its strengths apparently included real-time transformation of canvas areas, rapid zooming, and the absence of limitations on tools when zooming: arguably demonstrating more a limitation of contemporary packages with their own peculiar interfaces. ExpLAN subsequently released Arcol Desktop, although the &quot;desktop&quot; label only indicated that the program would multi-task with desktop applications and offer some desktop functionality, particularly for the loading and saving of images: the program still employed a special full-screen user interface, albeit allowing other 256-colour modes to be used, with the mode of the original being the default. With expectations having evolved with regard to user interfaces and desktop compatibility, this updated product was judged less favourably, with the partitioning of functionality between the desktop and painting interface being &quot;awkward&quot; and the behavioural differences &quot;confusing&quot;, leaving the product looking &quot;rather dated&quot; when compared to its modern contemporaries.

In early 1991, in the context of remarks that, at that point in time, the Paint application bundled with RISC OS was &quot;the only true Risc OS art program&quot; operating in the desktop and not restricting users to specific display modes, Longman Logotron released Revelation, an application running in the desktop environment, providing interoperability with other applications through support for the platform&#x27;s standard Sprite and Drawfile formats, with vector graphics import being provided by a companion tool, and utilising the system&#x27;s printing framework. Apart from observations of limited functionality in some areas, one significant limitation reminiscent of earlier products was the inability to change display mode without affecting the picture being edited. This limitation was not convincingly removed in the second version, sold as Revelation 2 around a year later, with colours being redefined when selecting a 16-colour display mode while editing a 256-colour image, preserving the inability to edit 256-colour images in 16-colour modes. A further version update was delivered as the Revelation ImagePro product, being considered &quot;the best art package that I have used on the Archimedes&quot; by Acorn User&#x27;s graphics columnist in late 1992.

In response to the evolving competitive situation and market expectations, Clares released ProArtisan 2, a successor to its earlier product, in late 1993 as &quot;a completely new program&quot; with some familiar features from the company&#x27;s earlier products but offering display mode independence, 24-bit colour support (including support for ColourCard and G8/G16 graphics cards), multi-document editing, and desktop compliance. The path editing tools familiar from its predecessor were supported using functionality from Acorn&#x27;s Draw application, and the image enhancement capabilities had also &quot;undergone a major revamp&quot;. At a reduced price of £135, and with use of the RISC OS desktop contributing to overall ease of use, the package was considered by one reviewer as &quot;the best art package around at the moment for the Archimedes&quot;.

Late in the Archimedes era, this being prior to the release of the Risc PC, a consensus amongst some reviewers formed in recommending Revelation ImagePro and ProArtisan 2 as the most capable bitmap-based art packages on the platform, with Arcol Desktop and First Paint also being reviewer favourites. With the release of the Risc PC and A7000, offering improved hardware capabilities and built-in support for 24-bit colour, the art package market changed significantly. New packages supplanted older ones as recommendations, some from new entrants within the broader Acorn market (Spacetech&#x27;s Photodesk, Pineapple Software&#x27;s Studio24), others coming from established vendors (Clares&#x27; ProArt24 and Longman Logotron&#x27;s The Big Picture), and still others from beyond the Acorn market (Digital Arts&#x27; Picture). However, the platform and hardware requirements of such packages were generally beyond Archimedes era machines, demanding 8 MB of RAM or 24-bit colour display modes (using 2 MB of dedicated video RAM) in some cases. A notable exception was Studio24 which, having been significantly updated in its second version, was reportedly &quot;completely compatible&quot; with the earlier machines.

=== Vector image editing ===

RISC OS was supplied with the Draw application, offering a range of tools for creating diagrams and pictures using vector graphics primitives, also permitting the incorporation of bitmap images and text into documents, and managing the different elements of documents as a hierarchy of objects. A significant capability provided by the application (and exploited by art packages) was that of Bézier curve editing, allowing shapes with smooth curves to be created, rendered and printed.

The file format used by Draw was documented and extensible, and a range of tools emerged to manipulate Draw files for such purposes as distorting or transforming images or objects within images. Amongst them was the Draw+ (or DrawPlus) application which defined other object types and also added other editing features, such as support for multiple levels or layers in documents. DrawPlus became available in 1991 and was released &quot;at nominal cost&quot; via public domain and shareware channels. The author of DrawPlus, Jonathan Marten, subsequently developed an application called Vector, released by an educational software publisher, 4Mation, in early 1992. Described as &quot;effectively an enhanced Draw&quot;, the program improved on Draw&#x27;s text handling by allowing editing of imported text, continued DrawPlus&#x27;s support for layers and object libraries, provided efficient handling of replicated or repeated objects, and introduced masks that acted as &quot;windows&quot; onto other objects. Priced at £100, even for site-wide usage, the software was considered &quot;ideal... for technical drawing, to graphic design and even limited desktop publishing&quot;. A version of Draw was also developed for Microsoft Windows by Oak Solutions.

A significant introduction to the Archimedes&#x27; software portfolio came with the release of ArtWorks by Computer Concepts in late 1992. Described in one preview as &quot;perhaps the easiest to use, but most advanced graphic illustration package, on any personal computer today&quot;, ArtWorks provided an object-based editing paradigm reminiscent of Draw, refining the user interface, and augmenting the basic functionality with additional tools. A notable improvement over Draw was the introduction of graduated fills, permitting smooth gradients of colour within shapes, employing dithering to simulate a larger colour palette. The image rendering engine was also a distinguishing feature, offering different levels of rendering detail, with the highest level introducing anti-aliasing for individual lines. Aimed at professional use, and complementing its sibling product, the Impression desktop publishing application, 24-bit colour depths and different colour models were supported. A key selling point of the package was its rendering speed, with it being reported that redraw speeds were up to five times faster in ArtWorks on an ARM3-based machine than those experienced with CorelDRAW running on a 486-based IBM PC-compatible system. ArtWorks would have broader significance as predecessor to the Xara Studio application and subsequent Windows-based products.

=== Document processing and productivity ===

Although document processing and productivity or office software applications were addressed by a few packages released in the Arthur era of the Archimedes, bringing titles such as First Word Plus, Logistix, and PipeDream, it was not until the availability of RISC OS that the Archimedes would see the more compelling software developed for the platform being delivered, with Acorn even delaying its own Desktop Publisher to take advantage of this substantial upgrade to the operating system.

Alongside Acorn Desktop Publisher, Computer Concepts&#x27; &quot;document processor&quot; Impression and Beebug&#x27;s Ovation provided a small selection of solutions in the realm of desktop publishing. Acorn pursued the publishing industry with software and hardware system bundles, with Impression typically featuring prominently, even in the era of the Archimedes&#x27; successor, the Risc PC. Ovation was eventually succeeded by Ovation Pro in 1996, offering stronger competition to Impression Publisher—itself the professional package in the range that had developed from Impression—and to industry-favoured applications such as QuarkXPress.

Amongst a variety of word processor applications, one enduring product family for the platform was developed by Icon Technology who had already released a word processor, MacAuthor, for the Apple Macintosh. This existing product was ported to RISC OS and released as EasiWriter in 1991, fully supporting the outline fonts and printing architecture of the host system. Icon followed up to EasiWriter with an enhanced version (&quot;EasiWriter&#x27;s big brother&quot;) in 1992, TechWriter, featuring mathematical formula editing. Both products were upgraded to provide mail-merge capabilities—a noted deficiency of the first release of EasiWriter—and both provided convenient table editing, with TechWriter also offering automatic footnote handling, being promoted as &quot;a complete package for producing academic and technical documents&quot;. Upgraded &quot;Professional&quot; editions of EasiWriter and TechWriter were released in 1995, with the latter adding the notable feature of being able to save documents in TeX format.

Given the platform&#x27;s presence in education, various educational word processing and publishing applications were available. Longman Logotron supplied a &quot;cost-effective introduction to DTP&quot; in the form of FirstPage, retailing at £49 plus VAT with &quot;unlimited&quot; educational site licences costing up to £190. Targeting machines with only 1 MB of RAM, various traditional word processing features such as a spelling checker and integrated help were omitted, but as a frame-based document processor it was considered &quot;excellent value for money&quot; when compared to the pricing and capabilities of some of its competitors, even appealing to the home market. Similarly, Softease&#x27;s &quot;object-based&quot; document processor, Textease, also had potential appeal beyond the educational market, freeing the user from having to design page layouts using frames, instead permitting them to click and type at the desired position or to drag and drop graphical objects directly into the page, providing a user interface paradigm reminiscent of the Draw application provided with RISC OS. Document layout capabilities were nevertheless available, supporting multiple column layouts, as were the traditional features such as spellchecking and integrated help absent from FirstPage. Pricing was even more competitive at around £30, or £40 with spellchecking support.

Aside from the hybrid word processor and spreadsheet application, PipeDream, being released in versions 3 and 4 for the RISC OS desktop environment, Colton Software released a standalone word processor, Wordz, in 1993, with plans for companion applications and a degree of integration between them. The first of these companion applications was Resultz, and the two applications were combined to make Fireworkz, itself incorporating the editing capabilities of both applications within a single interface, offering the ability to combine textual and spreadsheet data on the same page within documents. Colton subsequently expanded the family in 1995 with the Recordz database product, combining it with the existing Fireworkz functionality to make the Fireworkz Pro product, this bringing it into direct competition with Acorn&#x27;s Advance and Minerva&#x27;s Desktop Office suites, but ostensibly offering a much deeper level of integration than those competitors. PipeDream itself was later updated to version 4.5, conforming more closely to the RISC OS look and feel, being initially offered as an upgrade for users of version 4.0.

Acorn&#x27;s own interest in developing applications led it to initiate work on the Schema spreadsheet application, only to disengage from application development and to transfer the product to Clares who, with assistance from the originally commissioned developers, brought the product to market. Despite its origins as one component in an application suite that was never delivered as envisaged, a cut-down version of Schema 2 was later incorporated into Acorn&#x27;s Advance application suite alongside variants of Computer Concepts&#x27; Impression Junior and Iota Software&#x27;s DataPower. Schema 2 itself was enhanced with a &quot;powerful macro language&quot; and released in 1994.

In the spreadsheet category, Longman Logotron&#x27;s Eureka, released in 1992, provided robust competition to Schema and PipeDream, seeking to emulate Microsoft Excel in terms of functionality and user interface conventions. The interoperability benefits of the updated product, Eureka 2, were later given as a reason for Acorn to adopt the software internally, acquiring a 300-user site licence and thus allowing its employees to convert &quot;substantial spreadsheet data which needed converting from Lotus 1-2-3&quot;. Updated again as Eureka 3, with new features remedying &quot;what was badly missing in the earlier version&quot;, but with the manual regarded as inadequate and with online help still absent from the application, the application was nevertheless regarded as the most powerful of the platform&#x27;s principal spreadsheet offerings, attempting to be &quot;the &quot;Excel&quot; of the Acorn world&quot;.

A number of database applications were made available for the Archimedes, with Minerva Software following up from its early applications on the system, DeltaBase and System Delta Plus, with the RISC OS desktop-compliant Multistore in early 1990: a relational database with a graphical &quot;record card&quot; interface and report generation functionality. A broadly similar approach, albeit without any claimed &quot;relational&quot; capabilities, was offered by Digital Services&#x27; Squirrel database manager software, emphasising customisation of the presentation of data and reporting, but also introducing a flowchart-based method of querying, this feature causing one reviewer to regard the product as &quot;the most innovative database manager on the Archimedes&quot; with its usability being comparable to FileMaker on the Apple Macintosh.

Aimed at the education market, with a focus more on &quot;computerised data handling&quot; than data management, Longman Logotron&#x27;s PinPoint framed the structuring and retention of data around a questionnaire format, with a form editor offering &quot;DTP-style facilities&quot;, and with data entry performed interactively via the on-screen questionnaire. Some analysis and graphing capabilities were also provided. A version of PinPoint would eventually be made available for Windows, ostensibly aimed at market research as opposed to education, as its producer attempted to broaden its audience and availability for different platforms. Also emphasising a desktop publishing style of presentation was Iota Software&#x27;s DataPower, employing these facilities to customise record entry to &quot;make data collection as much like form-filling as possible&quot; and in the reporting functionality of the software.

In 1993, Longman Logotron introduced S-Base, a programmable database offering the possibility of customised database application development. Described as &quot;a more disciplined, less graphical approach to database design&quot;, the software enforced a degree of discipline around data type and table definition, but it also retained various graphical techniques to design forms for interaction with the database. Building on such foundations, programs could be written in a language called S to handle user interaction, graphical user interface events, and to interact with data in the database. Being compared to the contemporary DOS-based Paradox software, it was regarded as having more of an emphasis on &quot;database applications&quot; than actual databases, also being considered as similar to the contemporary RISC OS application, Archway, as a kind of &quot;application generator&quot; tool.

DataPower, S-Base and Squirrel were all subsequently upgraded, S-Base 2 being enhanced with features to simplify the setting up of applications and consequently being regarded as &quot;without doubt the most powerful database management system available for the Archimedes&quot; due to its programmable nature, Squirrel 2 gaining relational capabilities and being recommended for its &quot;amazing flexibility&quot; and for its searching and sorting functionality, with DataPower being recommended more for &quot;the majority of users&quot; for its usability and &quot;attractive graphs and reports&quot;.

Despite spreadsheet and database applications offering graphing capabilities, dedicated applications were also available to produce a wider range of graphs and charts. Amongst these were Chartwell from Risc Developments and the Graphbox and Graphbox Professional packages from Minerva Software. Arriving somewhat later than these packages, being released by Clares in January 1994, Plot also sought to cater for mathematical and educational users by offering support for function plotting, this having been largely ignored by the existing packages which tended &quot;to be based on producing bar and pie charts from tables of figures&quot;.

=== Full-motion video ===

With the introduction of CD-ROM and the broader adoption of multimedia, Acorn announced a full-motion video system called Acorn Replay in early 1992, supporting simultaneous audio and video at up to 25 frames per second in the RISC OS desktop or in &quot;a low resolution full screen mode&quot;. Unlike certain other full-motion video technologies, Replay offered the ability to read compressed video data from mass storage in real time and to maintain a constant frame rate, all on standard computing hardware without the need for dedicated video decoding hardware. The compression techniques employed by Replay reportedly offered &quot;compression factors of between 25 and 40&quot; on the source video data, with the software decompression requiring a computer with 2 MB of RAM or more.

Given a slower access medium such as CD-ROM or floppy disk, video could be played back at up to 12.5 frames per second, with up to 25 frames per second from a hard disk. One 800 KB floppy disk could reportedly hold 12 seconds of video. In the introductory phase of the technology, support for Replay files was quickly introduced into hypermedia applications such as Genesis and Magpie, with software developers being the primary audience for the creation of content, largely due to the expense of the equipment required to capture and store large volumes of video data. Software developers would engage the services of a suitably equipped company to convert source material to digital form, with the Replay software then used to process the video frame by frame, employing image compression techniques and &quot;a form of Delta compression&quot;, ultimately producing a movie file.

Acorn&#x27;s introduction of Replay prompted comparisons with Apple&#x27;s QuickTime system which was already broadly available to users of Macintosh systems. Replay&#x27;s advantages included the efficiency of the solution on existing hardware, with even an entry-level A3000 upgraded to 2 MB of RAM being able to handle 2 MB of data per second to achieve the advertised 12.5 frames per second playback. In contrast, a Macintosh system with 2 MB of RAM was reportedly unable to sustain smooth video playback, although audio playback was unaffected by the dropped video frames, whereas a 4 MB system could achieve 15 frames per second from a CD-ROM drive, although such a system was more expensive than Acorn&#x27;s ARM3-based systems that could more readily achieve higher frame rates. QuickTime was also reported as only able to play video smoothly at 1/16th of the size of the screen, also favouring 32,000 colour display modes that were available on Macintosh systems with 68020 or faster processors. One disadvantage of Replay on the Acorn systems was the limitation of playback to 256 colours imposed by the built-in video system.

Educational software and resources providers saw the potential of Replay to deliver interactive video at a more affordable price than existing Laservision content, although it was noted that, at that time, Laservision still provided &quot;the best quality, full-screen, moving image to date&quot;. Opportunities were perceived for making compilations of video clips available on CD-ROM for multimedia authoring purposes, although educational developers felt that the true value of the technology would be realised by making video like other forms of information, permitting its use in different contexts and works and thus offering children &quot;control over the media&quot;. Educators also looked forward to more accessible authoring possibilities, with children being able to record, edit and incorporate their own video into their projects. However, the expense associated with handling video data, with the storage of one minute of video estimated at 60 MB, combined with the expense of commercial video digitisation, estimated at £100 per minute of video, meant that such possibilities would remain inaccessible for most users at that time. Indications that this situation would change were present in the QuickTime market, with it already supporting the creation of short movies in conjunction with video digitiser cards and editing tools such as Adobe Premiere.

Support for video authoring on the desktop emerged in 1993 with the Replay DIY product from Irlam Instruments: a single-width podule suitable for A540 and A5000 computers with 2 MB of RAM or more, these being the only models available at the time with the necessary performance. The podule accepted analogue video input from video cameras, recorders and laserdisc players, allowing the video to be previewed in a window on the desktop. While recording, no preview would be shown, and the hardware would digitise the audio and video input, transfer the data to the computer&#x27;s memory, and this would then be sent straight to a hard disk. At its introduction, the video quality was limited to &quot;normal Arm2 Replay, that is 256-colour, 160x128 pixels at 12.5 frames per second&quot;, although an upgrade to capture 25 frames per second was anticipated. Uncompressed video occupied around 21 MB per minute, but processing of such video using the provided Acorn Replay compression software would bring the size of the resulting video down to around 4 or 5 MB per minute. Compression was, however, relatively slow, since the compression scheme was asymmetric, meaning that decompression was fast enough to facilitate playback in real time, but compression could take &quot;a few minutes for every few seconds of video&quot;. Nevertheless, the possibilities of video capture were predicted to &quot;generate and maintain immense interest in the classroom, or even at home&quot;, and the digitiser&#x27;s low cost (at £250 plus VAT) together with low-cost editing software such as Uniqueway&#x27;s Empire (at £50 plus VAT) was regarded as surprising, possibly in light of the high cost of services previously needed to achieve similar results.

Further developments in the video authoring domain were brought to the platform by Eidos, who had developed an &quot;offline non-linear editing system&quot; around the Archimedes in 1989, involving the digitisation of source video and its storage on hard disks or magneto-optical media for use with editing software. Such software would be used to produce an &quot;edit schedule list&quot; based on editing operations performed on the digitised, &quot;offline&quot; video, and these editing details would subsequently be applied in an &quot;online&quot; editing session involving the source video, this typically residing on &quot;linear&quot; media such as tape. To support the more convenient offline editing environment, a highly efficient symmetric compression scheme known as ESCaPE (Eidos Software Compression and Playback Engine) had been devised, offering movie sizes of around 1.5 MB per minute. To remedy the time-consuming process of using Acorn&#x27;s Replay compression software with the Replay DIY product, this being a consequence of the &quot;Moving Lines&quot; compression scheme emphasised by Replay at that time, Eidos introduced its own compression software for Replay DIY based on ESCaPE and given the same name. Together with the Eidoscope software, based on Eidos&#x27; professional Optima software, it was claimed that &quot;no other computer platform has anything to match in terms of convenience and sheer usability&quot; and that these developments would &quot;encourage a lot more Archimedes users to have a go at making movies&quot;. In 1995, Computer Concepts offered a bundle featuring Eidoscope and the company&#x27;s Eagle M2 &quot;multimedia card&quot; which featured audio and video capture, improved audio playback, and MIDI ports. Aimed at non-professional applications, Eidoscope was limited to editing movies up to a resolution of and did not support time codes.

=== Development tools ===
With the introduction of the Archimedes, Acorn continued the practice established for its earlier machines of offering languages in addition to BASIC, albeit priced somewhat higher than the earlier implementations, these including Pascal, C, Prolog, Fortran and Lisp. Other vendors produced implementations of Forth, such as Silicon Vision&#x27;s RiscForth, and Logo, such as Logotron Logo. Other Acornsoft languages such as BCPL and COMAL were not ported to the new platform and had to be run under emulation. A Smalltalk-80 implementation was also made available by Smalltalk Express costing £620, offering the familiar window-based environment, but requiring a 4 MB machine and a hard drive.
====BASIC====
Acorn had always emphasised its implementation of BBC BASIC in its earlier machines, and the Archimedes was delivered with an enhanced version, BASIC V, that provided additional control-flow structures such as while loops, case statements, and multi-line if statements. Graphics primitives and operations were also accessible via special-case keywords such as codice_1, codice_2, codice_3 and codice_4, and the specification of colours was extended to access the broader colour palette supported by the hardware. Various commands were also added for sprite plotting and manipulation and to enable, confine, disable and read the position and state of the mouse pointer. Assembly language support was included, as it had been in the BASIC provided by Acorn&#x27;s 8-bit models, with the language updated to describe instructions for the ARM processor instead of the 6502 (or other processor families) familiar from the earlier machines. Access to operating system functionality was provided from BASIC, with some of the demonstration programs provided with the Arthur operating system employing the font and window manager operating system modules, including the rudimentary desktop environment.

The arrival of RISC OS brought the possibility of developing desktop, or WIMP, applications in BASIC and other languages. Being available as standard, BASIC was a natural choice for many developers of desktop applications, although &quot;the complexity of the Wimp&quot; and the need to defer to operating system functionality described in the &quot;RISC OS Programmer&#x27;s Reference Manual&quot;, this consisting of &quot;a staggering 52 Wimp calls&quot;, required some mitigation by tutorials seeking to guide programmers through the mechanisms and techniques involved. To ease the development of such applications, various products offering toolkits or libraries were announced, one of the earliest being Archway, this providing tools to define different aspects of an application, including window layout design and menu editing, along with BASIC library routines. More ambitious attempts were later made to extend BASIC to access desktop functionality. For instance, HelixBasic added extra keywords to BASIC V whilst also making it possible for traditional BASIC programs, including graphical programs, to run in the window-based environment transparently and concurrently.

Although the performance of the supplied BASIC interpreter had been regarded as competitive, various BASIC compilers were produced for the system, such as Dabs Press&#x27; Archimedes Basic Compiler (ABC) and Silicon Vision&#x27;s RiscBASIC. Both products focused on improving the performance of the input programs, but Silicon Vision subsequently introduced a separate product, WimpGEN, as an accessory for desktop application developers. This product provided window and menu editors that would generate BASIC source code implementing the functionality required to support operation in the desktop environment. Specific application functionality would then be added, and the resulting program could also be compiled using RiscBASIC before being run.

BBC BASIC on the Archimedes was considered as a vehicle for cross-platform game development by David Braben and other developers before the Archimedes was released, Braben being the author of the three-dimensional Lander game supplied with the machine. Since the BBC Micro had been used as a development host for the Commodore 64 version of Elite and reportedly by Commodore to assist Amiga development &quot;in the early days&quot;, a similar role was anticipated for the Archimedes in game development, this role also having the potential to expose games developers for established platforms (such as the Amiga, Atari ST, and the Sega and Nintendo consoles) to the Acorn machine. The ability to cross-assemble code in the BASIC assembler for processors other than the ARM was devised, and support from key individuals at Acorn was secured, but the company&#x27;s management were reluctant to incorporate support for other systems in its product, thus curtailing the effort.

====C====
Despite the use of BASIC and ARM assembly language by some software houses, notably at Computer Concepts whose developers regarded the ARM processor as having been &quot;designed to be programmed in Assembler&quot; and where Impression and ArtWorks were implemented in ARM assembly language using the BASIC assembler, the use of higher-level languages such as C became increasingly desirable for productivity and portability reasons. That Acorn had been in a position to offer its own C compiler was reportedly the consequence of &quot;a stroke of luck&quot;: this product having been originally developed by Arthur Norman and Alan Mycroft for a mainframe at Cambridge University and subsequently offered to Acorn.

Acorn&#x27;s original C compiler and assembler products were superseded by its Desktop C and Desktop Assembler products in mid-1991. These products comprised Acorn&#x27;s Desktop Development Environment, aiming to reduce the time and effort involved in developing applications and modules along with supporting such activities in the desktop environment itself. Both products provided an enhanced version of Edit known as SrcEdit for source code editing that supported &quot;throwback&quot;: navigation to locations in source code produced by other tools such as the C compiler. The Desktop Debugging Tool (DDT) was described as &quot;a rather impressive line by line debugger&quot; supporting breakpoints and watchpoints and allowing conventional application code (as opposed to modules) to be stepped through by &quot;actually stopping the desktop&quot;, with control over this activity exercised through desktop-like windows operating separately from the actual desktop. Alongside compiler, assembler and linker tools, a build utility known as Make and supporting Makefiles was provided along with an improved version of the FormEd tool used for application window design. Desktop C cost £229 plus VAT, and Desktop Assembler cost £149 plus VAT.
====C++====
Acorn&#x27;s C++ strategy was the subject of a degree of criticism. Initially, the company announced the availability of AT&amp;T&#x27;s CFront to its registered developer community, this translating C++ code for further compilation by Acorn&#x27;s Desktop C product. Acorn followed up by offering a new product, replacing Desktop C, that integrated CFront 3.0 to support C and C++ compilation, albeit without support for exceptions. Feedback from developers had been negative, however, citing poor-quality code and slow compilation times, with developers apparently wanting &quot;a true native C++ compiler with good RISC OS environment support&quot;. Despite the adoption of C++ class libraries on other platforms, Acorn chose to provide user interface component functionality using a collection of modules, known as the Toolbox, accessible at the system call level instead.
Apart from a port of the GNU C++ compiler, itself requiring at least 4 MB of RAM to run, the only significant competition to Acorn&#x27;s C and C++ products were the Easy C and Easy C++ products from Beebug, with the former being announced in late 1993 as a Risc Developments product costing £49 plus VAT. Priced significantly less than Acorn&#x27;s compiler, Easy C provided a narrower range of tools, lacking the debugger of Acorn&#x27;s product in particular, and had also not been validated as conforming to the ANSI language standard, unlike Acorn&#x27;s compiler. Nevertheless, it did provide the essential compiler, assembler, linker and build tools, aiming to be &quot;an easy to use C development system aimed at the lower end of the market&quot;. In late 1994, Beebug followed up by announcing Easy C++ in advance of the availability of Acorn&#x27;s own C++ product. Easy C++ compiled C++ source code directly to ARM object code and supported both templates and exceptions. It was priced at £99 plus VAT or £49 plus VAT as an upgrade from Easy C. The product was seemingly positively received, with the developers having &quot;achieved the target they set themselves&quot; by delivering a native C++ compiler, although the lack of updated documentation and the need for further development to improve the product were also identified.

Ultimately, the stated lack of a suitable C++ compiler and accompanying class libraries for the platform led prominent development houses to focus on products for other platforms and to abandon plans to release new software for RISC OS. In 1994, Mark Colton of Colton Software criticised Acorn for not complementing its C compiler with &quot;C toolbox&quot; libraries to assist with application development, and regarded Acorn as being &quot;at a standstill&quot; relative to broader development tool trends such as the introduction of Visual Basic and the increasing adoption of C++ together with class libraries for application development. Charles Moir of Computer Concepts justified the development of Xara Studio, a graphics application described as effectively &quot;ArtWorks for the PC&quot;, indicating that only the larger market for Windows software could make the necessary investment in such a sophisticated application worthwhile. Since Windows development could leverage C++ and platform-specific class libraries, Computer Concepts had expected Acorn to deliver comparable tools and resources to make the development of such software possible on the Acorn platform &quot;to no avail&quot;. Ben Finn of Sibelius Software indicated that Sibelius 7 had been a &quot;completely new piece of software&quot; written in C++, in contrast to earlier versions written in assembly language, primarily due to the difficulties of implementing requested features in such a low-level language. The portability of C++ software also permitted Sibelius to be made available for the PC and Mac platforms. However, with Acorn unable to provide a suitably updated C++ development suite, the company was unable to deliver its new product on RISC OS.

=== Graphical capabilities ===
The Archimedes machines (and their equivalents running RISC iX) used the VIDC1a video chip to provide a wide variety of screen resolutions, expanding on those available on the BBC Micro, including the following:

Since the video controller would not support display modes smaller than 20 KB, the lowest resolution modes were supported in the operating system by employing modes with twice the horizontal resolution and duplicating horizontally adjacent pixels.

The introduction of RISC OS brought support for a number of new display modes including the following:

The A540 and A5000 supported additional display modes:

High-resolution monochrome display modes were offered by the A440, A400/1 series and A540:

Apparent confusion about monochrome monitor support upon the launch of the Archimedes models led Acorn to clarify that the A400 series had &quot;extra circuitry&quot; offering two additional display modes &quot;of up to 1280 by 976 in monochrome, and 160 columns by 122 lines of text, but only using a special monitor&quot;, this being connected using two BNC sockets (one for signal and one for sync).

The A540 (and corresponding R-series workstations) offered three BNC sockets, adding one for a separate horizontal sync connection for certain monitors. Acorn suggested the 19-inch Taxan Viking and Philips M19P114 monitors, with the former being offered in a bundle with the R140 workstation. The Taxan Viking R140 product bundled the existing Viking product with appropriate cabling and produced a &quot;rock steady&quot; 66 Hz mode 23 display, albeit with mouse pointer corruption at the extreme right of the screen due to &quot;a bug in the VIDC chip&quot;.

The A5000 unlike its predecessor, the A540, did not support high resolution monochrome modes.

==== Graphics expansions ====

An expansion to speed up the VIDC chip in the Archimedes from 24 MHz to 36 MHz was announced by Atomwide in 1990, offering higher resolution display modes for machines connected to multisync monitors. Although resolutions up to and were supported, flicker due to a decreased refresh rate was reported as a problem, with appearing to be more comfortable in this regard. The SVGA resolution of was also supported in up to 16 colours. One side-effect of increasing the frequency of the VIDC was to also increase the frequency of generated sounds, since the VIDC was also responsible for sound generation. VIDC enhancers were supplied by some monitor vendors together with the appropriate cable for Archimedes machines, although fitting the device still required approved service work to be performed. Monitors such as the Taxan 795 Multivision were only usable in multisync modes without the VIDC enhancer whose accompanying software sought to &quot;redefine all modes&quot; to be compatible with the display as well as providing new modes.

One drawback of VIDC enhancer solutions was the increased memory bandwidth used by the VIDC at its newly elevated frequency, slowing down machines when using higher resolution modes, particularly machines with ARM2 processors and slower memory busses. Consequently, other solutions were adopted to work around the limitations of the built-in display hardware, notably &quot;graphics enhancers&quot; such as the PCATS graphics enhancer from The Serial Port, and &quot;colour cards&quot; such as Computer Concepts&#x27; ColourCard and State Machine&#x27;s G8 which provided a separate framebuffer, holding a copy of the normal screen memory, for use in generating a video signal independently of the system&#x27;s main memory. This permitted higher refresh rates (up to 70 Hz) even for higher resolution modes, although the maximum size of the screen memory imposed by the VIDC () also imposed a limit on available resolutions and colour depths, with being the highest resolution 256 colour mode that could be supported. However, such cards were also able to support more flexible palettes in 256 colour modes than the VIDC, and for lower resolutions, greater colour depths offering over 32,000 colours could be supported. The ColourCard was reported to allow an ARM2 system to use a display mode with 16 colours (occupying 480 KB) with an operating speed of &quot;160% of the speed of the considerably lower resolution Acorn mode 28&quot;, this being with 256 colours (occupying 300 KB).

State Machine, founded by former hardware designers from Computer Concepts and Watford Electronics, announced a range of colour card peripherals, starting with the G8 and G8+ in late 1992, followed by the G8 Professional, these cards being demonstrated at the BBC Acorn User show in 1992, as was the Computer Concepts ColourCard. One potentially significant difference between the different product ranges was the role of the VIDC, with the ColourCard employing a &quot;video switch&quot; that permitted the VIDC to generate an output signal independent of the card for traditional display modes, with the card only generating output for enhanced modes, whereas the State Machine cards were entirely responsible for output and thereby provided emulations of the traditional modes, this leading to a &quot;letter-box&quot; effect for some modes in early versions of the State Machine software and also causing compatibility issues with software, particularly games, that accessed VIDC registers directly to configure the display. Subsequent developments from State Machine brought the G16 card, offering application-specific support for 15 and 16 bits per pixel modes.

Alongside bandwidth constraints, a fundamental limitation to the size of VIDC framebuffers was imposed by the memory controller, limiting the size of framebuffers transferred to the VIDC through DMA to a specific 512 KB physical memory region. State Machine&#x27;s ColourBurst card, announced together with its G16 card, employed memory mapping techniques to provide 1 MB of video RAM instead of the 512 KB of earlier cards and thus supporting larger screen modes. The ColourBurst was, when reviewed in late 1993, the first 24-bit colour card available for the Archimedes, also supporting various upgrades including the &quot;video switch&quot; capability absent from earlier cards, PAL encoding, and other professional capabilities.

Coincidentally, ARM Limited announced the VIDC20—the successor to the VIDC10 in the Archimedes—at around the same time as the introduction of the Computer Concepts and State Machine product ranges in late 1992. By late 1993, rumours about Acorn&#x27;s next-generation system (eventually released as the Risc PC), particularly 24-bit colour support, led to suggestions of improved support for higher colour depths in RISC OS, accompanied by the observation in the context of State Machine&#x27;s ColourBurst card that &quot;it seems unlikely that another manufacturer will release such a powerful device before the launch of Acorn&#x27;s new baby&quot;. In late 1993, Computer Concepts announced the ColourCard Gold, developed in conjunction with Acorn to offer 15 bits per pixel support in the desktop environment. Meanwhile, State Machine announced the ClusterCard for 33 MHz A5000 models, plugging into the memory controller socket and supporting upgrades to 8 MB of RAM alongside graphics enhancements offering 1 MB or 2 MB of video RAM. The ClusterCard, employing the G335 Cluster Module was reported to be the first graphics card for the Archimedes series not requiring the use of the VIDC.

With IBM PC compatible systems leaving the Archimedes &quot;well behind the competition in the display stakes&quot;, the ClusterCard was seen as attempting a solution similar to a local bus architecture on the A5000, with the potential to &quot;transform the A5000 into a serious graphics machine, with possibly as good a display potential as the next Acorn series equipped with VIDC20s&quot;. The launch of the Risc PC in 1994 demonstrated Acorn&#x27;s successor to the Archimedes, to which State Machine responded with a product called ColourView, &quot;an all-new replacement for the original G8 and G16 State Machine graphics cards&quot;, offering 16 bits per pixel desktop-compatible screen modes, with a modular version also available for the ClusterCard without the 1 MB framebuffer. The full version of the card was reportedly available for A300 series, A400 series, A5000 and A540 machines.

Somewhat distinct from general graphics enhancements, various products were also introduced to support the broadcasting industry and other professional imaging applications. In late 1990, Millipede Electronic Graphics announced an imaging product called APEX (Archimedes P3 Expansion) featuring &quot;four P3 (pixel pipeline processor) chips, together with an Arm3 processor running at 27 MHz&quot;. With support for &quot;broadcast quality graphics at 32 bits per pixel&quot;, hardware support for windows and sprites, emphasising real-time image combination and manipulation, the product was aimed at professional users and priced accordingly, with the version providing 4 MB of RAM projected to cost £2750. Nevertheless, a licensing agreement had been reached with Acorn to &quot;enable Risc OS graphics functions to be fully emulated&quot;. Following up from this earlier product, Millipede offered an &quot;all new Apex Imager&quot; video card in early 1994 featuring the four custom chips, ARM3, FPA, and 16 MB of video RAM on a double-width podule costing £3975, this being virtually unchanged from the pricing of the original product from 1990. This product appears to make extensive use of FPGA devices and offers numerous video input and output facilities. Apex hardware was used by the Eidos video capture and compression solution, Thumper, which ran on a Risc PC and was able to process &quot;MPEG 1 resolution video at full PAL frame rate in real time&quot;, being regarded in early 1995 as &quot;the best digitiser for our needs on any platform&quot; by Eidos&#x27; managing director. Previous Eidos capture solutions used A540 machines with 8 MB of RAM.

=== Sound and audio ===

The Archimedes was capable of producing eight-channel, 8-bit, stereo sound, with the video controller chip being responsible for sound generation, it having direct memory access capabilities to independently stream audio data to the output circuitry. Some users sought to bypass the audio filtering circuitry to improve sound from the external audio connector.

=== Floating-point arithmetic ===

The Archimedes did not provide hardware support for floating-point arithmetic as standard, but the system was designed so that one might be added, with a floating-point co-processor instruction set architecture having been defined by Acorn for programs to use. As part of the system architecture, a software module provides an emulation of such a co-processor, handling floating-point instructions unsupported in hardware using software written using conventional ARM instructions. The co-processor was described as a &quot;cut-down&quot; ARM with only eight registers available instead of sixteen, offering instructions to transfer values to and from memory (supporting single, double, extended double and packed binary-coded decimal representations), to transfer values between the main CPU and co-processor, to transfer status information from the co-processor, to perform unary and binary operations on values, and to perform comparisons.

In the first generation of Archimedes 300 and 400 series machines, only the 400 series had the appropriate expansion capability to add a floating-point unit (FPU) or co-processor, although the emulator was supported on all models. The expansion capability was retained in the 400/1 series. The FPU expansion card was delivered for the R140 workstation and 400 series in 1989, priced at £599 plus VAT, and was based on the WE32206, with a &quot;protocol converter chip&quot; being used to translate between the ARM and the WE32206. The WE32206 card was also offered for Acorn&#x27;s Springboard expansion card for IBM PC compatibles. Although Acorn had expected that interfacing the ARM to an existing FPU chip would be &quot;a much quicker route&quot; to delivering a hardware-based floating-point solution than developing a new co-processor, the complexity involved in developing the custom gate array responsible for interfacing to the WE32206 was apparently greater than anticipated, taking two years to deliver.

Reviews of the FPU were generally unenthusiastic, noting that Acorn&#x27;s claims of an eight-fold speed-up were unlikely to be achieved in &quot;a practical program&quot;, nevertheless reporting that programs performing repeated floating-point operations yielded speed-ups ranging from around four to sixteen times that of a base ARM2-based system. Somewhat more applied testing demonstrated speed-ups for benchmark programs of up to eight times, aligning with Acorn&#x27;s claims, but contrasted these gains with the broader performance increases attainable from an ARM3 upgrade, these offering a more general four-fold speed improvement. Largely focusing on BASIC programming, one reviewer concluded that the FPU was &quot;all but obsolete&quot; with the availability of the ARM3 upgrade. Another conceded that some but not all C programs would benefit from the FPU since &quot;a good programmer will avoid using floating point instructions if at all possible&quot;, suggesting that Acorn&#x27;s R140 workstation would benefit more from the upgrade. However, BASIC programs compiled using the Archimedes BASIC Compiler achieved over nine-fold speed-ups for certain benchmarks, unlike those running on the standard BASIC interpreter whose floating-point routines avoided using FPU instructions, thus delivering no real performance improvements with the FPU fitted.

The Archimedes models based on the ARM3 processor supported a completely new &quot;arithmetic co-processor&quot; or &quot;floating-point accelerator&quot; known as the FPA. Released in 1993 for the R260 workstation and the A540 and A5000 machines, priced at £99 plus VAT, the FPA device—known specifically as the FPA10—was fitted in a dedicated socket on the processor card for the R260 and A540, or in a motherboard socket in the A5000. It offered a peak throughput of 5 MFLOPS at 26 MHz. The models officially supporting the FPA had been introduced some time prior to availability of the device, and various ARM3 upgrade cards for earlier models had also been made available with an FPA socket in anticipation of eventual availability. Fabrication of the device was performed by GEC Plessey Semiconductors and was reported to be in &quot;an advanced stage of production&quot; in early 1993. Availability remained unclear, with ARM releasing technical details indicating that the chip, at 134,000 transistors was reportedly &quot;Arm&#x27;s most complex IC to date&quot; and comparing its performance at &quot;around 4 MFLOPS&quot; to the MIPS R3010 floating-point co-processor, whilst claiming a substantial power consumption advantage. Further details were given upon the eventual release of the FPA10, stating a 26 MHz operating frequency and a power consumption of 250 mW. Reception from major software producers such as Computer Concepts and Colton Software was cautious, with the former&#x27;s products not making any use of floating-point instructions and thus not standing to benefit, and with the latter&#x27;s using such instructions but indicating skepticism about any significant benefits in performance.

Observations from testing the FPA10 confirmed that applications such as Resultz and PipeDream 4—both Colton Software products—and other spreadsheets, whilst ostensibly standing to benefit as number processing applications, exhibited &quot;no noticeable speed improvements&quot;, this being attributed to these applications&#x27; avoidance of unnecessary calculation and the more significant overhead of servicing a graphical user interface. Other programs such as Draw and ArtWorks—a Computer Concepts product—used their own arithmetic routines instead of the floating-point emulator (FPE) and, as anticipated, were therefore unable to take advantage of the accelerated floating-point instructions. However, various free of charge or low-cost programs ported from other systems, such as POV-Ray, plus selected native applications such as Clares&#x27; Illusionist and Oak Solutions&#x27; WorraCAD, did exhibit substantial performance gains from the FPA with speed-ups of between five and ten times. Programs compiled by Intelligent Interfaces&#x27; Fortran compiler were reported as running &quot;some routines up to 20 times faster with the FPA10&quot;. Although the FPA10 only implemented arithmetic operations, delegating trigonometric operations to the FPE, it was able to operate concurrently with the main CPU and maintained its own instruction pipeline, allowing the CPU to proceed with other instructions until a floating-point instruction result was required. Speculative execution was also employed to improve performance.

Observed BASIC program performance remained in line with experiences from the earlier FPU solution. The BASIC VI (or Basic64) interpreter bundled with RISC OS which was &quot;much slower than Basic V normally&quot;, with the former using the FPE and the latter providing its own floating-point arithmetic routines, ended up &quot;slightly faster&quot; than BASIC V due to observed speed-ups of around four to around eleven times, with non-trigonometric operations benefiting the most in one analysis. Another analysis employing benchmarks of individual arithmetic and trigonometric operations indicated a more uniform distribution of performance improvements for BASIC VI programs, also noting that BASIC VI delivered more precision than BASIC V in its floating-point representation. The product was perceived as &quot;good value&quot; but having restricted usefulness with the general lack of support in many applications, these employing their own routines and techniques to attempt to provide performant arithmetic on the base hardware platform, and a lack of incentive amongst software producers to offer support without a large enough market of users having the FPA fitted.

With the FPA10 having finally become available but only rated to run at 26 MHz, and with ARM3 upgrades being delivered at frequencies as high as 35 MHz, a higher-rated part, the FPA11, supporting 33 MHz operation was developed and apparently delivered in products such as a processor card upgrade for the A540. ARM3 upgrades were also produced with 33 MHz ARM3 processors, but unlike their 25 MHz counterparts which were available with FPA10 co-processors already fitted, these faster cards were not supplied with FPA11 co-processors, perhaps due to availability issues with the faster part.

=== ARM3 upgrades ===

In early 1990, Aleph One introduced an upgrade board for Archimedes A300 and A400 series models featuring the ARM3 processor which had been designed by Acorn but was sold independently by VLSI Technology. Although the ARM2 employed by current models could reportedly be run at 20 MHz, it was only ever run at 8 MHz due to external limitations, these being the speed of the data bus and of the &quot;relatively slow&quot;, but correspondingly relatively inexpensive, RAM devices in use. The ARM3 incorporated a 4 KB on-chip combined instruction and data cache, loosening such external constraints and thus permitting the processor to be run productively at the elevated 20 MHz frequency. With a processor running at this higher speed, the overall performance of a computer with the ARM3 upgrade was reported as double that of the machine without the upgrade (&quot;on average, execution times were halved&quot;), with programs performing input/output benefiting rather less (&quot;a worst case of 30 percent improvement&quot;). Original A300 and A400 series models, as opposed to the A400/1 series, required an upgrade to MEMC1a. One hundred percent compatibility with the ARM2 was claimed, and a facility was provided to disable the on-chip cache and to slow the clock to 8 MHz in order to handle software that ran too fast with the ARM3 running at full speed, but as originally provided, the ARM3 was not compatible with the existing hardware floating point co-processor solution due to the introduction of a different co-processor interface in the device, this interface eventually being used by the FPA device. The upgrade was introduced at a price of £684.24, with the MEMC1a costing £57.50 for those users who needed it.

By the end of 1991, an ARM3 upgrade had been offered for the A3000 by Aleph One in association with Atomwide and by Watford Electronics. Since the ARM2 was soldered directly to the motherboard in the A3000 using surface mounting techniques, the upgrade had to be performed by a fitting service, and prices included courier collection, fitting, testing and return within five working days. With the A5000 having been launched with a 25 MHz ARM3 fitted, these A3000 upgrade boards carried a processor running at this higher frequency relative to earlier upgrades. Originally, the Aleph One product had been priced at £468.83, but the announcement of a board by Watford Electronics led to a reduced price of £392.45. The Watford product had an introductory price of £274.95.

Other vendors produced ARM3 upgrades. In late 1992, Simtec Electronics announced a board with an additional socket for the FPA device, thus allowing older machines to join the A540 and A5000 in potentially taking advantage of it. By this time, prices for ARM3 upgrades had been reduced to the point that this Simtec upgrade cost only £175 plus VAT. Competitors including IFEL and CJE Micros followed Simtec&#x27;s lead and announced similar combined ARM3/FPA upgrades. In contrast, Aleph One stated that the FPA would &quot;not be available for a long time yet&quot;, indicating the pursuit of &quot;a better solution based on the newer Arm600 chip plus an FPA&quot;. Other vendors had apparently ruled out similar ARM600-based products on the basis of cost. In 1993, IFEL later announced a 35 MHz ARM3 upgrade based on a limited quantity—approximately 1500—of available suitably rated parts, these having a ceramic package whose volume ruled out its use in machines with limited internal space, making the upgrade suitable for A300, A400 or R140 machines. A combined ARM3/FPA upgrade with the faster ARM3 was under consideration, although the lack of suitably rated FPA chips meant that a switch would be provided to manually change the clock frequency between 25 MHz and 35 MHz. A target price of £199 including VAT was estimated.

Prior to the availability of the FPA, Simtec reduced the price of its combined ARM3/FPA board to £165 plus VAT. The company also released a &quot;turbo RAM&quot; upgrade for ARM250-based machines to provide similar performance benefits to an ARM3 upgrade, replacing the RAM with a faster type that then permitted the processor to be run at a higher frequency, thus pursuing the alternative approach to enhancing system performance (increasing both the processor and memory speed) to that pursued by ARM3 upgrades (introducing a faster processor with a cache). With the upgrade, performance of these machines was reported as increasing from 7 MIPS to 10 MIPS, this compared to almost 13 MIPS for a 25 MHz ARM3. By employing a 16 MHz clock signal, as envisaged by Acorn in the design of the A3010, in conjunction with dynamic RAM devices with a 70 ns access time, the upgrade provided a total of 4 MB of RAM and a 40 percent performance improvement. Unlike standard RAM upgrades, the turbo upgrade needed to be fitted at a suitable facility, and the board was priced slightly higher than a standard RAM upgrade at £129 plus VAT. A &quot;super turbo&quot; version of the board with 20 MHz crystal and 45 ns dynamic RAM devices was reviewed and apparently available subject to component availability, reportedly achieving 12.25 MIPS.

Aleph One, having founded the ARM3 upgrade industry, found that increased competition from &quot;six or eight companies making Arm3 upgrades&quot; drove down prices to the point that &quot;margins fell, and the bottom fell out of the Arm3 market&quot;. However, revenues from ARM3 upgrades allowed Aleph One to pursue the development of IBM PC-compatible podule expansions and eventually the PC processor card for the Risc PC, these having &quot;a higher intellectual content than Arm3 upgrades&quot; and being more difficult for potential competitors to make. Plans were indicated to develop a PowerPC processor card for the Risc PC. Neither the PowerPC upgrade for the Risc PC nor the earlier ARM600-based upgrade for the Archimedes series appeared, with Acorn itself abandoning plans to combine newer ARM600 or ARM700 parts with FPA devices to provide improved floating point performance.

ARM3 upgrades were produced for several years, but with the ARM3 part being &quot;officially discontinued&quot; by its manufacturer VLSI in 1996, upgrade vendors such as IFEL were predicting scarcity and unable to guarantee further supplies of such products. Demand for such upgrades, even in 1996, was reported as &quot;steady&quot; with schools still upgrading &quot;batches of old A300 and A400 machines&quot;. Later still, in 1997, Simtec announced a &quot;special batch&quot; of ARM3 upgrades for A300 and A400 series machines and the A3000, featuring a socket for the 25 MHz FPA10 or 33 MHz FPA11, with the former being supplied already fitted for a total product cost of £199 plus VAT.

=== IBM PC-compatible podules ===

Acorn initially planned to produce an IBM PC-compatible system on a podule (peripheral module), complete with 80186 processor (running at 10 MHz) and disk drive support. Subsequent pricing and competitiveness considerations led to the product being shelved. However, in late 1991, hardware supplier Aleph One announced a PC podule based on a 20 MHz Intel 80386SX processor with VGA display capability. Launched in early 1992, the podule fitted with 1 MB of RAM cost £595, whereas a 4 MB version cost £725. Known as the 386PC, the expansion was &quot;in effect, a PC within your Archimedes&quot; whose RAM could be upgraded from the minimum of 1 MB, the price of this configuration having fallen to £495 at the time of its review, to the maximum of 4 MB, with this configuration also being offered at a reduced price of £625. A socket on the board permitted the 80387 maths co-processor to be fitted for hardware floating point arithmetic support, this costing an extra £120. Integration of the PC system involved the Archimedes providing display, keyboard and disk support. In the initial version, the supplied 386PC application would put the Archimedes into dedicated display mode and thus take over the display, but subsequent versions promised operation of the PC in a window, much like the updated PC Emulator from the era. Screen memory requirements were around 256 KB for MDA and CGA, with EGA and VGA requiring another 256 KB. Separate serial and parallel ports were fitted on the expansion board due to limitations with the ports on existing Archimedes machines, but integration with those ports was also planned for subsequent versions of the product.

Watford Electronics, in association with &quot;prolific ex-Computer Concepts hardware expert&quot; Chris Honey, announced a PC podule in early 1992, this effectively delivering &quot;a stand-alone PC&quot; within the host computer and potentially allowing two independent users with their own keyboards and monitors, although the PC system would be accessible via a desktop window and have access to RISC OS hard drive partitions. This product was apparently never released, however, and its designers subsequently formed graphics expansion producer State Machine. In late 1992, Aleph One reduced the price of the 386-based card by £100, also upgrading the processor to a 25 MHz part, and introduced a card featuring a 25 MHz Cyrix 486SLC processor, with the new card retaining the maths co-processor option of the earlier product. The stated performance of this new card was approximately twice that of the 386-based card but only &quot;40 percent of the performance of a standard 33 MHz 486DX PC clone&quot;. However, upgraded Windows drivers reportedly allowed even the 386-based card to exceed the graphical performance of such a 486-based clone, effectively employing the host Archimedes as a kind of &quot;Windows accelerator&quot;. A subsequent review moderated such claims somewhat, indicating a Windows performance &quot;not noticeably better than an average un-accelerated 386SX PC clone&quot;, although acceleration support was expected to improve, with device drivers for various direct drive laser printers also expected. The product was priced at £495 for the 1 MB version and £595 for the 4 MB version, with a future revision of the product anticipated that would support up to 16 MB of RAM.

In 1993, Aleph One collaborated with Acorn to produce Acorn-branded versions of the PC cards for use with the A3020 and A4000 which used a distinct &quot;mini-podule expansion system&quot;. The 25 MHz 386SX and 486SLC cards were offered in this profile to provide DOS and Windows compatibility, branded as the PC386 and PC486, priced at £275 and £499 respectively. In late 1993, the supplied software was upgraded and discounts to the products announced, bringing the respective prices down to £225 and £425. Acorn also offered bundles of the A4000 with a hard drive and each of the cards. Coincidentally at this time, with speculation building about future Acorn computer products, Acorn&#x27;s product marketing manager had been reported as suggesting that such products &quot;would have an empty Intel socket for customers to add PC Dos and Windows compatibility&quot;. Such remarks were clarified by Acorn&#x27;s technical director, indicating that an Intel &quot;second processor&quot; was merely an option in an architecture supporting multiple processors. Ultimately, Acorn would release the Risc PC with dual processor capabilities and support for using a &quot;low cost (£99 upwards) plug-in 486 PC processor or other CPUs&quot; alongside an ARM processor.

Redesigned PC cards were released in 1994, introducing the option of a faster 50 MHz 486SLC2 processor for a reported doubling of the performance over the fastest existing cards. Up to 16 MB of SIMM-profile RAM could be fitted, and a local hard drive controller was added. The supplied software was also upgraded to support Windows in a resolution of at up to 16 colours, and optional network driver support was available to use the card as a Novell NetWare client and for Windows for Workgroups 3.11. Pricing remained similar to earlier models. Reported performance was better than the previous generation of cards but &quot;still slow compared to all but the most basic of modern PCs, but certainly usable&quot;. The Windows User benchmarks rated the performance as similar to a fast 386SX-based system or a &quot;standard&quot; 386DX-based system, with the faster processor yielding a more favourable rating, but with the hard drive and graphics tests bringing the overall rating down. Use of a hard drive fitted directly to the card, using its own dedicated IDE interface, was reported as providing up to ten times the level of hard drive performance relative to using the system&#x27;s own drive, but use of the SmartDrive caching software made any resulting performance difference marginal.

=== Parallel and data processing ===

A range of podules providing access to parallel processing capabilities using Inmos Transputer processors were announced by Gnome Computing in late 1989. Aside from a &quot;Link Adaptor&quot; podule for interfacing to external Transputer hardware, the &quot;TRAM Motherboard&quot; podule combined the Link Adaptor&#x27;s interfacing logic with the hosting of up to four &quot;TRAMs&quot; (Transputer plus RAM modules), providing a complete development system based on the Archimedes. Also offered was a &quot;Transputer Baseboard&quot; podule featuring a T425 or T800 with up to 8 MB of RAM. A single podule with four TRAMs, each employing a T800 processor, was stated as giving 40 MIPS of performance, with a hypothetical 160 MIPS available on an Archimedes with four podule slots.

Digital signal processing capabilities were provided by the Burden Neuroscience 56001 DSP Card, originally developed by the Burden Neurological Institute as in-house hardware for use in conjunction with Archimedes systems but marketed by The Serial Port. This card was fitted as a single-width podule but, unusually, needed manual configuration instead of identifying itself to the host computer. The podule itself offered a 32 MHz Motorola 56001 digital signal processor together with 192 KB of RAM, two 16-bit analogue-to-digital converters, two 16-bit digital-to-analogue converters, and serial communications capabilities. A 25-pin connector provided the means to interface the board to other hardware. An assembler was provided, although this reportedly required Acorn&#x27;s Desktop Development Environment to function, and software was also provided to interact with the board, view memory and register contents, and to visualise memory ranges in real time. Described as appropriate for &quot;high speed analogue data acquisition or output&quot; supporting real time signal processing, the product was considered &quot;a useful 56001 development test bed&quot;, requiring a certain level of expertise, but was also considered good value at a price of £449 plus VAT.

=== CD-ROM and related storage ===

CD-ROM technology was introduced to the Archimedes range in 1990 with the launch of Next Technology&#x27;s CD-ROM solution for the A3000 and earlier Archimedes models. Combining an SCSI interface and CD-ROM drive and supplied with a sample disc for a total price of £995, the solution provided a filing system so that standard CD-ROM media could be browsed and read like any other kind of disc. An application was also provided to play audio tracks on CD Audio and mixed-format discs through the drive&#x27;s headphone socket. The drive itself used a caddy to hold the discs inserted into the drive. One limitation experienced on RISC OS was with the content on various CD-ROM titles, this often being designed for MS-DOS and featuring DOS-only software to offer search and database-related functionality. Next Technology aimed to remedy this situation by offering a service to let users create their own CD-ROMs at around £300 per disc, leading to the initial conclusion that schools and institutional users would benefit from the format much more than home users.

Two years on from the introduction of CD-ROM products, adoption of the technology was still at a &quot;tentative state&quot;, with £8 million having been spent on equipment and an estimated 3,000 drives deployed in UK schools. Drive prices had fallen significantly, from around £1,000 to £300 and with a further decline to £200 anticipated. As a significant technology in the delivery of multimedia content, the focus had shifted from merely using CD-ROM as a cheap storage medium for large amounts of graphics and text to aspirations of providing &quot;high-quality, full-screen graphics coupled with hi-fi stereo sound&quot; on CD media, with the principal challenge identified as being able to deliver compressed video that either a computer or a drive could decompress without compromising video quality or introducing incompatibilities between different manufacturers&#x27; products.

Acorn&#x27;s video solution for its own computers was the Replay system, introducing compression formats and associated software for playback and authoring. However, laserdisc technology, which had been used several years earlier by Acorn for interactive video applications, notably in the BBC Domesday Project, was still seen as being a &quot;promising rival&quot; to CD-based video formats, having finally &quot;become successful in multimedia training&quot; and by then &quot;being aimed at well-heeled home video enthusiasts&quot;. Reservations about the read-only nature of CD-ROM discs was also seen as a &quot;wounding flaw&quot;, leaving users to consider alternatives for convenient bulk storage, with magneto-optical drives emerging at this time. Nevertheless, CD-ROM adoption was seen as inevitable, particularly given the format&#x27;s benefits for holding large amounts of text and making the searching of such text convenient, and with government initiatives having helped to make an estimated 100 titles available for both MS-DOS and RISC OS. The dual-function nature of the media and the ability to use drives to play audio also made such products generally attractive purchases, particularly for home users and with Photo CD also regarded as an attraction, although the introduction of Philips&#x27; CD-i and Commodore&#x27;s CDTV risked a level of confusion in this market as well as presenting another challenge in terms of compatibility for Acorn&#x27;s own products and technologies.

Acorn would go on to announce Photo CD support in its products in early 1993, with operating system and application enhancements being delivered by the end of that year. Although the video and memory capabilities of the Archimedes machines were generally unable to take advantage of the higher colour depths or the largest sizes of the scanned images on Photo CD media, the introduction of future hardware from Acorn, featuring the next generation of video controller from ARM and supporting 24-bit colour displays, was anticipated. Support for multi-session CD-ROMs entailed some upgrades to existing SCSI interfaces as well as the use of drives with the appropriate capabilities such as Acorn&#x27;s own Multimedia Expansion Unit.

=== Networking capabilities ===

The Archimedes was launched with provision for an optional Econet module to be installed, this module being the same as that used by the Master series. Acorn introduced Ethernet connectivity with the launch of the company&#x27;s R140 Unix workstation, also offering expansion cards for Archimedes models. In 1992, Atomwide also introduced Ethernet cards for the traditional Archimedes expansion bus and for the internal expansion slot in the A3000. Ethernet could be used as faster medium for existing Econet-style networking, or the TCP/IP protocol stack could be employed instead. Acorn sought to introduce Econet functionality on top of Internet protocols with its Acorn Universal Networking (AUN) suite of technologies.

Numerous vendors offered Ethernet expansion cards, such as Ant Limited (via Atomwide), Digital Services, i-cubed, Oak Solutions, and Risc Developments. Although compatible with AUN, some of the cards offered support for vendor-specific enhancements such as Oak Solutions&#x27; ClassNet and Digital Services&#x27; NetGain. Other networking approaches were available, including the sharing of hard drives using a SCSI bus, and emerging technologies such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode were deployed on the Acorn platform, notably in SJ Research&#x27;s Nexus product.

=== BBC Micro interfacing and ROM software support ===

As a way of offering continuity with the BBC Micro and the user port, 1 MHz bus port and analogue port that were provided by the earlier range of machines, Acorn announced an I/O podule at the launch of the Archimedes, this being fitted with the 6522 VIA featured in the BBC range, with the possibility of upgrading the podule to provide a MIDI port. A ROM podule was also announced with the anticipation that users upgrading from the earlier machines would choose to fit their application and language ROMs in their new machine, these running under the 6502 emulator provided with the operating system.

In early 1988, Computer Concepts announced its own ROM/RAM podule that was capable of accepting seven chips, each with a maximum capacity of 128 KB, supporting the use of installed RAM as &quot;a RAM-disc filing system&quot; with optional battery backup to retain the contents with the machine powered down. The company also announced the availability of its existing BBC Micro productivity suite for use with the board. Acorn also released its ROM and I/O podules in the first half of 1988. Other companies also offered I/O expansions, such as the Unilab I/O Box 3000 for the A3000 that provided three user ports, analogue port and 1 MHz bus port. HCCS and Morley Electronics supplied podules for the A3000 that provided user and analogue ports, with Morley&#x27;s product also offering an I2C bus connector ostensibly for the use of subsequent peripherals from the company.

== Impact ==

A mid-1987 &quot;Personal Computer World&quot; preview of the Archimedes based on the &quot;A500 Development System&quot; expressed enthusiasm about the computer&#x27;s performance, that it &quot;felt like the fastest computer I have ever used, by a considerable margin&quot;, indicating that the system deserved success in the education market and might have more success than Acorn&#x27;s earlier models in the business market, comparing favourably to the Macintosh II or IBM PS/2 Model 80. Similar enthusiasm was reflected by the same writer in a &quot;Byte&quot; magazine preview of the A310 the following month. However, dissatisfaction with the availability of essential applications, such as the lack of a word processor specifically written for the system at its launch, and the incoherent user experience presented by early applications, highlighted perceived deficiencies with the product from the perspective of users and potential users.

Acorn had predicted sales of 20,000 Archimedes machines by the end of 1987 and 120,000 by the end of 1988. However, by mid-1988 only 14,000 units had reportedly been sold. One commentator attributed such disappointing sales to the lack of software support for the system, noting that Acorn had not invested sufficiently in software availability and that few established companies in the Acorn market were delivering native applications. Acorn&#x27;s strategy of commissioning applications available for other platforms, such as First Word Plus and Logistix, was regarded as &quot;hardly innovative&quot; and that the platform needed &quot;a massive injection of native, innovative software&quot;, perhaps by a revitalised Acornsoft.

With the imminent arrival of RISC OS for the Archimedes, later coverage around the start of 1989 praised the desktop and supplied applications, noting that &quot;RISC OS is everything the Archimedes&#x27; original Desktop should have been but wasn&#x27;t&quot;, and looked forward to future applications from Acorn and third parties, only lamenting that it was &quot;a shame that this impressive environment was not in place at the Archimedes&#x27; launch, but it&#x27;s still not too late for it to turn some heads&quot;. The introduction of the A3000, launched with RISC OS fitted, delivered better than expected sales for Acorn, with an estimated total of 50,000 Archimedes and A3000 systems having been sold by the end of 1989.

By early 1991, 100,000 Archimedes machines had been sold, with the A3000 being the largest selling computer in UK schools, with Acorn&#x27;s Archimedes and Master 128 accounting for 53% of sales in an eight-month period during 1990, and with the 32-bit machines &quot;outselling the Master 128 by a factor of two to one&quot;. In this period, over two-thirds of computer sales into primary schools had been Acorn models, with Acorn&#x27;s 40% share of sales into secondary schools making the company the largest single vendor in this section of the market. By mid-1992, a reported 180,000 Archimedes machines had been sold, again due to strong A3000 sales. By 1994 and the launch of the Risc PC, over 300,000 Archimedes machines had been sold, and the A3000 had become the fourth best selling computer in the United Kingdom. By the launch of the StrongARM J233 variant of the Risc PC in 1997, over 600,000 Archimedes, A-series and Risc PC systems had been sold.

The Archimedes was distributed to varying degrees outside the UK. Enquiries about the Archimedes range were reportedly handled for the US and Canada via Olivetti Canada, with distribution and servicing in Canada being undertaken by Comspec in association with Olivetti Canada. In Italy, the Archimedes was promoted and distributed by G. Ricordi &amp; C., previously appointed as Acorn&#x27;s exclusive distributor in the country.

=== Performance ===

Acorn&#x27;s original claims for the Archimedes noted a performance of 4 million instructions per second (MIPS), these reportedly being equivalent to DEC VAX-11/750 instructions. With the VAX-11/750 rated at , Acorn&#x27;s claimed translates crudely to around . However, the initial Archimedes 310 model achieved around , delivering competitive performance against more expensive contemporary personal computers such as the Compaq Deskpro 386 (priced from $6,499 including 40 MB hard drive), with the Compaq achieving around . (A VAX-11/780 running VAX/VMS 4.2 produced the baseline Dhrystone score of 1757 corresponding to , this also being used to calculate MIPS ratings for Dhrystone 2 benchmark results.)

This level of performance made the Archimedes one of the most powerful home computers available during the late 1980s and early 1990s, with its CPU outperforming the Motorola 68000 found in both the cheaper Amiga 500 and Atari ST machines as well as the more expensive Macintosh and Amiga 2000. Although an 68000 has a performance rating of around , the 68000-based Amiga 1000 reportedly achieved around when benchmarked as a system. In comparison, systems based on the ARM2, such as the BBC A3000, benchmarked from up to , depending on the operating system version and display configuration.

Performance improvements would be delivered over time for the Archimedes and its competitors. For example, the Compaq Deskpro 386/16 model was replaced in 1988 with a 386/20 model offering somewhat improved CPU performance (around ) and in 1989 by a 386/33 model improving CPU performance still further (to around ). Upgraded Amiga models also offered steadily improving performance, with the Amiga 2500/20 appearing in 1988 and the Amiga 2500/30 appearing in 1989, these delivering approximately and respectively, with an Amiga 2000 upgraded to a 68030 processor achieving a performance rating of around . The Macintosh II series incrementally improved their performance from around in 1987 with the original 68020-based model, through to around in the 68030-based Macintosh IIfx in 1990.

The increasing performance deficit relative to the x86 architecture was somewhat reduced with the introduction of the ARM3 in 1990: an Archimedes system such as the A410/1 upgraded to use a ARM3 could achieve , with the ARM3-based A5000 achieving a reported , rising to in its variant. ARM3 upgrades were initially rather expensive but decreased significantly in price and were available for all ARM2 systems, even the relatively inexpensive A3000. Thus, Acorn&#x27;s ARM3-based machines, generally priced for business or institutional users, remained broadly competitive. Acorn&#x27;s low-end A3010, fitted with an ARM250 processor, was capable of delivering from up to , remaining competitive with upgraded Amiga models such as the Amiga 2500.

With development of ARM technologies having been transferred to ARM Limited as a separate company, the performance advantages of Acorn&#x27;s ARM-based computers, maintained by the transition from the ARM2 to ARM3, eroded somewhat in the early 1990s relative to competitors using processors from established vendors such as Intel and Motorola, as new ARM processors gradually arrived offering more modest performance gains over their predecessors. With ARM Limited focusing on embedded applications, it was noted that &quot;the large performance lead Arm2 and Arm3 once enjoyed&quot; over contemporary Intel processors was over, at least for the time being.

The introduction of the 68040, and particularly the introduction of the 80486 with its subsequent evolution, put ARM3-based Archimedes models at an increasing performance disadvantage. Successors to the Macintosh II in the form of the Quadra and Centris series improved performance two- to four-fold over earlier models. An Amiga 4000 with 68040 CPU (or a suitably upgraded Amiga 2000 and 3000) could achieve a reported , whereas Compaq Deskpro 486/25 and 486/33 models achieved a reported and with 25 MHz and 33 MHz 80486 CPUs respectively, and with the introduction of 486DX2 CPUs at 50 MHz and 66 MHz during 1992 raising this to as much as around . Against such performance ratings only Acorn&#x27;s Risc PC 600 ( to ) fitted with an ARM610 CPU could keep up. However, by the time of its introduction in 1994, two years after the reported incorporation of the ARM610 in the Apple Newton, such performance had already been surpassed by Pentium-based models such as the Compaq Deskpro 5/66M Model 510 delivering .

Although the Archimedes, emulating floating-point arithmetic instructions in software, achieved Whetstone benchmark results comparable to Acorn&#x27;s earlier Cambridge Co-Processor product based on the 6 MHz NS32016 CPU with NS32081 floating-point unit, such levels of performance were rather less impressive in comparison to contemporary systems equipped with hardware floating-point support, merely reaching a performance level &quot;within a factor of two or less&quot; of IBM PC/AT systems equipped with a 80286 CPU and 80287 floating-point co-processor. Already in 1988, a 20 MHz Compaq system with a 80386 CPU and 80387 co-processor would achieve around or around 20 times the performance of the ARM2 emulating floating-point instructions. Acorn&#x27;s WE32206-based Floating Point Unit (FPU), available for the A400 series and R140, was expected to deliver ten-fold performance benefits, and was eventually claimed to offer eight-fold speed-ups. This left FPU-equipped systems delivering around half the performance of accelerated 386-based systems.

The claimed performance of Acorn&#x27;s Floating Point Accelerator (FPA10), available for ARM3-based Archimedes systems, was originally 5 MFLOPS, subsequently revised to &quot;around 4 MFLOPS&quot;, and may ostensibly have been broadly competitive with the MIPS R3010 (as claimed by ARM) in some systems under benchmark testing, with an A5000 fitted with FPA10 reportedly achieving around 4.3 MFLOPS, compared to various R3000/R3010-based systems achieving between 5.4 and 9.7 MFLOPS. However, unlike the R3010, announced in 1988 with claimed performance ratings of 4 MFLOPS for double-precision arithmetic and 7 MFLOPS for single-precision arithmetic, and available in workstation products the same year, the FPA10 was eventually delivered in 1993, by which time numerous subsequent MIPS products had been delivered with steadily increasing performance, diminishing the relevance of comparisons with the R3010. For example, the MIPS R4400, available from 1992, achieved around when benchmarked in systems. In contrast with the declining competitive situation of the ARM3, the ARM3 and FPA10 combination did appear to rather more competitive with the 486DX2 systems introduced in late 1992, these rated at around , but a year later these would be eclipsed by the performance of Pentium-based systems starting at .

=== Education ===

Continuing Acorn&#x27;s involvement with the BBC and its computer literacy initiatives, two of the first Archimedes models bore the BBC branding, as did the later BBC A3000 model. Dissatisfaction with this arrangement was voiced by competitor Research Machines and an industry group led by a Microsoft representative, the British Micro Federation, who advocated the use of &quot;business standard&quot; operating systems such as MS-DOS. Responding to claims that the BBC branding was &quot;unethical&quot; and &quot;damaging&quot;, a BBC Enterprises representative stated that the arrangement was &quot;a continuing part of the original computer literacy project&quot; and that bringing in &quot;something totally new would be irresponsible&quot;.

The range won significant market share in the education markets of the UK, Ireland, Australia, and New Zealand. Acorn&#x27;s considerable presence in primary and secondary education had been established through the Archimedes&#x27; predecessors—the BBC Micro and BBC Master—with the Archimedes supplementing these earlier models to see Acorn&#x27;s products collectively representing over half of the installed computers in secondary schools at the start of the 1990s.

In 1992, the Tesco supermarket chain initiated its &quot;Computers for Schools&quot; scheme in association with Acorn, offering vouchers for every £25 spent in Tesco stores that were redeemable against software and hardware products including complete computer systems, with this promotional campaign taking place over a six-week period. Over 15,000 schools registered to participate in the scheme and over 22 million vouchers were issued during the campaign period, placing the estimated value of the distributed products at over , although the actual value of distributed products was later reported as . Tesco and Acorn repeated the scheme in 1993 on the basis of the response to the previous year&#x27;s campaign, distributing software and hardware at an estimated value of to over 11,000 schools including 7,000 computers, and even introducing Acorn computers to some schools for the first time.

Despite the benefit to Acorn of expanding its customer base, dissatisfaction was expressed by dealers and software companies about the effects of the scheme, with anecdotes emerging of a reluctance to buy equipment that could be obtained for free, thus harming dealer revenues, although Acorn&#x27;s education marketing manager argued that the scheme&#x27;s effect was generally positive and actually produced sales opportunities for dealers. The inclusion of software products in the scheme was regarded by one commentator as harmful to both the companies whose products were featured, these &quot;not making enough profit from the transaction&quot;, and to those whose products were not, these seeing potential customers choose their competitors&#x27; &quot;free&quot; products. Noting that the scheme was &quot;not purely philanthropic&quot;, concern was expressed about the effect on the Acorn market and that schools were needing to &quot;resort to charities and publicity stunts to get the basic tools to do the job&quot;. In response to such criticism, independent software titles were dropped from the scheme in 1994, which ultimately distributed products to over 10,000 schools including 4,000 computers, with a total of 15,000 computers having been given away over the first three years of the scheme.

With Tesco having expanded its presence in Scotland through acquisitions, the Tesco scheme was extended to Scotland for the first time in 1995. Alongside updates to the featured product selection, the possibility was introduced of saving unredeemed vouchers for redemption in the 1996 campaign. By the end of the 1996 campaign, worth of products had been distributed, with the scheme having distributed products worth a total of , including 26,000 Acorn computers in its first five years.

By the mid to late 1990s, the UK educational market began to turn away from Acorn&#x27;s products towards IBM PC compatibles, with Acorn and Apple establishing a joint venture, Xemplar, to market these companies&#x27; products in the education sector as part of a strategy to uphold their market share. Through Xemplar&#x27;s involvement in the Computers for Schools scheme, Apple products were featured for the first time in the 1996 campaign. Xemplar&#x27;s involvement continued in subsequent years, introducing information technology training for teachers in 1998, and seeking to offer Acorn products in the 1999 campaign despite the turmoil around Acorn as the company sought to move away from the desktop computing market, subsequently selling its stake in Xemplar to Apple. In 2000, Tesco changed its partner in the Computers for Schools scheme from Xemplar to RM plc.

Acorn conducted other promotional initiatives towards the education sector. The Acorn Advantage programme, launched in September 1994, offered a loyalty scheme whereby points were accrued through purchases and redeemed for &quot;curriculum resources&quot; that included non-computing items such as musical and scientific instruments as well as computer hardware. Several commercial partners were involved in the scheme such as Fina, which awarded vouchers with petrol purchases that could be exchanged for points, and the Midland Bank which would donate points to schools joining its Midbank school-based banking system. An Acorn-branded Visa credit card would also generate Advantage points for nominated schools.

== Legacy ==

The Archimedes was used by music composers and scorewriters to run the Sibelius scorewriting software.

Between 1994 and 2004 the Archimedes and Risc PC models were used for teleprompters at television studios. The hardware was easy to adapt for TV broadcast use and cheaper than other hardware available at the time. Archimedes models saw use in other commercial broadcasting applications including scheduling and CD jukebox control for the Asda supermarket chain&#x27;s in-store satellite broadcast radio channel.

The performance and adaptability of the Archimedes range led these machines to be used in various entertainment venue applications and solutions. Tecnation&#x27;s Bitbopper utilised video digitisers, genlock and MIDI cards in Archimedes 440 computers, integrating audio and video inputs under the control of a &quot;light jockey&quot; and producing audiovisual output via venue entertainment system installations, utilising projectors, displays and other effects equipment. Laser Grafx&#x27;s Prisma system employed Archimedes 440 and A5000 machines to control laser effects installations at music concerts and nightclubs. A range of Archimedes and Risc PC models were used to control various aspects of the Quasar laser tag gaming experience, being introduced in an upgrade to the systems known as Chromaburst, itself subsequently being replaced by a more conservative solution using PC compatibles.

<text>Edgar Degas (, ; born Hilaire-Germain-Edgar De Gas, ; 19 July 183427 September 1917) was a French Impressionist artist famous for his pastel drawings and oil paintings.

Degas also produced bronze sculptures, prints, and drawings. Degas is especially identified with the subject of dance; more than half of his works depict dancers. Although Degas is regarded as one of the founders of Impressionism, he rejected the term, preferring to be called a realist, and did not paint outdoors as many Impressionists did.

Degas was a superb draftsman, and particularly masterly in depicting movement, as can be seen in his rendition of dancers and bathing female nudes. In addition to ballet dancers and bathing women, Degas painted racehorses and racing jockeys, as well as portraits. His portraits are notable for their psychological complexity and their portrayal of human isolation.

At the beginning of his career, Degas wanted to be a history painter, a calling for which he was well prepared by his rigorous academic training and close study of classical Western art. In his early thirties he changed course, and by bringing the traditional methods of a history painter to bear on contemporary subject matter, he became a classical painter of modern life.

==Early life==

Degas was born in Paris, France, into a moderately wealthy family. He was the oldest of five children of Célestine Musson De Gas, a Creole from New Orleans, Louisiana, and Augustin De Gas, a banker. His maternal grandfather Germain Musson was born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, of French descent, and had settled in New Orleans in 1810.
Degas (he adopted this less grandiose spelling of his family name when he became an adult) began his schooling at age eleven, enrolling in the Lycée Louis-le-Grand. His mother died when he was thirteen, and the main influences on him for the remainder of his youth were his father and several unmarried uncles.
Degas began to paint early in life. By the time he graduated from the Lycée with a &quot;baccalauréat&quot; in literature in 1853, at age 18, he had turned a room in his home into an artist&#x27;s studio. Upon graduating, he registered as a copyist in the Louvre Museum, but his father expected him to go to law school. Degas duly enrolled at the Faculty of Law of the University of Paris in November 1853 but applied little effort to his studies.

In 1855, he met Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, whom he revered and whose advice he never forgot: &quot;Draw lines, young man, and still more lines, both from life and from memory, and you will become a good artist.&quot; In April of that year Degas was admitted to the École des Beaux-Arts. He studied drawing there with Louis Lamothe, under whose guidance he flourished, following the style of Ingres.

In July 1856, Degas traveled to Italy, where he would remain for the next three years. In 1858, while staying with his aunt&#x27;s family in Naples, he made the first studies for his early masterpiece &quot;The Bellelli Family&quot;. He also drew and painted numerous copies of works by Michelangelo, Raphael, Titian, and other Renaissance artists, but—contrary to conventional practice—he usually selected from an altarpiece a detail that had caught his attention: a secondary figure, or a head which he treated as a portrait.

==Artistic career==
Upon his return to France in 1859, Degas moved into a Paris studio large enough to permit him to begin painting &quot;The Bellelli Family&quot;—an imposing canvas he intended for exhibition in the Salon, although it remained unfinished until 1867. He also began work on several history paintings: &quot;Alexander and Bucephalus&quot; and &quot;The Daughter of Jephthah&quot; in 1859–60; &quot;Sémiramis Building Babylon&quot; in 1860; and &quot;Young Spartans Exercising&quot; around 1860. In 1861, Degas visited his childhood friend Paul Valpinçon in Ménil-Hubert-en-Exmes, and made the earliest of his many studies of horses. He exhibited at the Salon for the first time in 1865, when the jury accepted his painting &quot;Scene of War in the Middle Ages&quot;, which attracted little attention.

Although he exhibited annually in the Salon during the next five years, he submitted no more history paintings, and his &quot;Scene from the Steeplechase: The Fallen Jockey&quot; (Salon of 1866) signaled his growing commitment to contemporary subject matter. The change in his art was influenced primarily by the example of Édouard Manet, whom Degas had met in 1864 (while both were copying the same Diego Velázquez portrait in the Louvre, according to a story that may be apocryphal).

Upon the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, Degas enlisted in the National Guard, where his partaking in the defense of Paris left him little time for painting. During rifle training his eyesight was found to be defective, and for the rest of his life his eye problems were a constant worry to him.

After the war, Degas began in 1872 an extended stay in New Orleans, where his brother René and a number of other relatives lived. Staying at the home of his Creole uncle, Michel Musson, on Esplanade Avenue, Degas produced a number of works, many depicting family members. One of Degas&#x27;s New Orleans works, &quot;A Cotton Office in New Orleans&quot;, garnered favorable attention back in France, and was his only work purchased by a museum (the Pau) during his lifetime.

Degas returned to Paris in 1873 and his father died the following year, whereupon Degas learned that his brother René had amassed enormous business debts. To preserve his family&#x27;s reputation, Degas sold his house and an art collection he had inherited, and used the money to pay off his brother&#x27;s debts. Dependent for the first time in his life on sales of his artwork for income, he produced much of his greatest work during the decade beginning in 1874. Disenchanted by now with the Salon, he instead joined a group of young artists who were organizing an independent exhibiting society. The group soon became known as the Impressionists.

Between 1874 and 1886, they mounted eight art shows, known as the Impressionist Exhibitions. Degas took a leading role in organizing the exhibitions, and showed his work in all but one of them, despite his persistent conflicts with others in the group. He had little in common with Monet and the other landscape painters in the group, whom he mocked for painting outdoors. Conservative in his social attitudes, he abhorred the scandal created by the exhibitions, as well as the publicity and advertising that his colleagues sought. He also deeply disliked being associated with the term &quot;Impressionist&quot;, which the press had coined and popularized, and insisted on including non-Impressionist artists such as Jean-Louis Forain and Jean-François Raffaëlli in the group&#x27;s exhibitions. The resulting rancor within the group contributed to its disbanding in 1886.

As his financial situation improved through sales of his own work, he was able to indulge his passion for collecting works by artists he admired: old masters such as El Greco and such contemporaries as Manet, Cassatt, Pissarro, Cézanne, Gauguin, Van Gogh, and Édouard Brandon. Three artists he idolized, Ingres, Delacroix, and Daumier, were especially well represented in his collection.

In the late 1880s, Degas also developed a passion for photography. He photographed many of his friends, often by lamplight, as in his double portrait of Renoir and Mallarmé. Other photographs, depicting dancers and nudes, were used for reference in some of Degas&#x27;s drawings, and paintings.

As the years passed, Degas became isolated, due in part to his belief that a painter could have no personal life. The Dreyfus Affair controversy brought his anti-Semitic leanings to the fore and he broke with all his Jewish friends. His argumentative nature was deplored by Renoir, who said of him: &quot;What a creature he was, that Degas! All his friends had to leave him; I was one of the last to go, but even I couldn&#x27;t stay till the end.&quot;

After 1890, Degas&#x27;s eyesight, which had long troubled him, deteriorated further. Although he is known to have been working in pastel as late as the end of 1907, and is believed to have continued making sculptures as late as 1910, he apparently ceased working in 1912, when the impending demolition of his longtime residence on the rue Victor Massé forced him to move to quarters on the Boulevard de Clichy. He never married, and spent the last years of his life, nearly blind, restlessly wandering the streets of Paris before dying in September 1917.

==Artistic style==

Degas is often identified as an Impressionist, an understandable but insufficient description. Impressionism originated in the 1860s and 1870s and grew, in part, from the realism of painters such as Courbet and Corot. The Impressionists painted the realities of the world around them using bright, &quot;dazzling&quot; colors, concentrating primarily on the effects of light, and hoping to infuse their scenes with immediacy. They wanted to express their visual experience in that exact moment.

Technically, Degas differs from the Impressionists in that he continually belittled their practice of painting &quot;en plein air&quot;.

You know what I think of people who work out in the open. If I were the government I would have a special brigade of gendarmes to keep an eye on artists who paint landscapes from nature. Oh, I don&#x27;t mean to kill anyone; just a little dose of bird-shot now and then as a warning.
&quot;He was often as anti-impressionist as the critics who reviewed the shows&quot;, according to art historian Carol Armstrong; as Degas himself explained, &quot;no art was ever less spontaneous than mine. What I do is the result of reflection and of the study of the great masters; of inspiration, spontaneity, temperament, I know nothing.&quot; Nonetheless, he is described more accurately as an Impressionist than as a member of any other movement. His scenes of Parisian life, his off-center compositions, his experiments with color and form, and his friendship with several key Impressionist artists—most notably Mary Cassatt and Manet—all relate him intimately to the Impressionist movement.

Degas&#x27;s style reflects his deep respect for the old masters (he was an enthusiastic copyist well into middle age) and his great admiration for Ingres and Delacroix. He was also a collector of Japanese prints, whose compositional principles influenced his work, as did the vigorous realism of popular illustrators such as Daumier and Gavarni. Although famous for horses and dancers, Degas began with conventional historical paintings such as &quot;The Daughter of Jephthah&quot; () and &quot;Young Spartans Exercising&quot; (), in which his gradual progress toward a less idealized treatment of the figure is already apparent. During his early career, Degas also painted portraits of individuals and groups; an example of the latter is &quot;The Bellelli Family&quot; (), an ambitious and psychologically poignant portrayal of his aunt, her husband, and their children. In this painting, as in &quot;Young Spartans Exercising&quot; and many later works, Degas was drawn to the tensions present between men and women. In his early paintings, Degas already evidenced the mature style that he would later develop more fully by cropping subjects awkwardly and by choosing unusual viewpoints.
By the late 1860s, Degas had shifted from his initial forays into history painting to an original observation of contemporary life. Racecourse scenes provided an opportunity to depict horses and their riders in a modern context. He began to paint women at work, milliners and laundresses. His milliner series is interpreted as artistic self-reflection.

&quot;Mlle. Fiocre in the Ballet La Source&quot;, exhibited in the Salon of 1868, was his first major work to introduce a subject with which he would become especially identified, dancers. In many subsequent paintings, dancers were shown backstage or in rehearsal, emphasizing their status as professionals doing a job. From 1870 Degas increasingly painted ballet subjects, partly because they sold well and provided him with needed income after his brother&#x27;s debts had left the family bankrupt. Degas began to paint café life as well, in works such as and &quot;Singer with a Glove&quot;. His paintings often hinted at narrative content in a way that was highly ambiguous; for example, &quot;Interior&quot; (which has also been called &quot;The Rape&quot;) has presented a conundrum to art historians in search of a literary source—&quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot; has been suggested—but it may be a depiction of prostitution.

As his subject matter changed, so, too, did Degas&#x27;s technique. The dark palette that bore the influence of Dutch painting gave way to the use of vivid colors and bold brushstrokes. Paintings such as &quot;Place de la Concorde&quot; read as &quot;snapshots,&quot; freezing moments of time to portray them accurately, imparting a sense of movement. The lack of color in the 1874 &quot;Ballet Rehearsal on Stage&quot; and the 1876 &quot;The Ballet Instructor&quot; can be said to link with his interest in the new technique of photography. The changes to his palette, brushwork, and sense of composition all evidence the influence that both the Impressionist movement and modern photography, with its spontaneous images and off-kilter angles, had on his work.
Blurring the distinction between portraiture and genre pieces, he painted his bassoonist friend, Désiré Dihau, in &quot;The Orchestra of the Opera&quot; (c. 1870) as one of fourteen musicians in an orchestra pit, viewed as though by a member of the audience. Above the musicians can be seen only the legs and tutus of the dancers onstage, their figures cropped by the edge of the painting. Art historian Charles Stuckey has compared the viewpoint to that of a distracted spectator at a ballet, and says that &quot;it is Degas&#x27; fascination with the depiction of movement, including the movement of a spectator&#x27;s eyes as during a random glance, that is properly speaking &#x27;Impressionist&#x27;.&quot;
Degas&#x27;s mature style is distinguished by conspicuously unfinished passages, even in otherwise tightly rendered paintings. He frequently blamed his eye troubles for his inability to finish, an explanation that met with some skepticism from colleagues and collectors who reasoned, as Stuckey explains, that &quot;his pictures could hardly have been executed by anyone with inadequate vision&quot;. The artist provided another clue when he described his predilection &quot;to begin a hundred things and not finish one of them&quot;, and was in any case notoriously reluctant to consider a painting complete.

His interest in portraiture led Degas to study carefully the ways in which a person&#x27;s social stature or form of employment may be revealed by their physiognomy, posture, dress, and other attributes. In his 1879 &quot;Portraits, At the Stock Exchange&quot;, he portrayed a group of Jewish businessmen with a hint of anti-Semitism. In 1881, he exhibited two pastels, &quot;Criminal Physiognomies&quot;, that depicted juvenile gang members recently convicted of murder in the &quot;Abadie Affair&quot;. Degas had attended their trial with sketchbook in hand, and his numerous drawings of the defendants reveal his interest in the atavistic features thought by some 19th-century scientists to be evidence of innate criminality. In his paintings of dancers and laundresses, he reveals their occupations not only by their dress and activities but also by their body type: his ballerinas exhibit an athletic physicality, while his laundresses are heavy and solid.
By the later 1870s, Degas had mastered not only the traditional medium of oil on canvas, but pastel as well. The dry medium, which he applied in complex layers and textures, enabled him more easily to reconcile his facility for line with a growing interest in expressive color.

In the mid-1870s, he also returned to the medium of etching, which he had neglected for ten years. At first he was guided in this by his old friend Ludovic-Napoléon Lepic, himself an innovator in its use, and began experimenting with lithography and monotype.

He produced some 300 monotypes over two periods, from the mid-1870s to the mid-1880s and again in the early 1890s.

He was especially fascinated by the effects produced by monotype and frequently reworked the printed images with pastel. By 1880, sculpture had become one more strand to Degas&#x27;s continuing endeavor to explore different media, although the artist displayed only one sculpture publicly during his lifetime.
These changes in media engendered the paintings that Degas would produce in later life. Degas began to draw and paint women drying themselves with towels, combing their hair, and bathing (see: &quot;After the Bath, Woman drying herself&quot;). The strokes that model the form are scribbled more freely than before; backgrounds are simplified.

The meticulous naturalism of his youth gave way to an increasing abstraction of form. Except for his characteristically brilliant draftsmanship and obsession with the figure, the pictures created in this late period of his life bear little superficial resemblance to his early paintings. In point of fact, these paintings—created late in his life and after the heyday of the Impressionist movement—most vividly use the coloristic techniques of Impressionism.

For all the stylistic evolution, certain features of Degas&#x27;s work remained the same throughout his life. He always painted indoors, preferring to work in his studio from memory, photographs, or live models. The figure remained his primary subject; his few landscapes were produced from memory or imagination. It was not unusual for him to repeat a subject many times, varying the composition or treatment. He was a deliberative artist whose works, as Andrew Forge has written, &quot;were prepared, calculated, practiced, developed in stages. They were made up of parts. The adjustment of each part to the whole, their linear arrangement, was the occasion for infinite reflection and experiment.&quot; Degas explained, &quot;In art, nothing should look like chance, not even movement&quot;. He was most interested in the presentation of his paintings, patronizing Pierre Cluzel as a framer, and disliking ornate styles of the day, often insisting on his choices for the framing as a condition of purchase.

==Sculpture==


Degas&#x27;s only showing of sculpture during his life took place in 1881 when he exhibited &quot;The Little Dancer of Fourteen Years&quot;. A nearly life-size wax figure with real hair and dressed in a cloth tutu, it provoked a strong reaction from critics, most of whom found its realism extraordinary but denounced the dancer as ugly. In a review, J.-K. Huysmans wrote: &quot;The terrible reality of this statuette evidently produces uneasiness in the spectators; all their notions about sculpture, about those cold inanimate whitenesses ... are here overturned. The fact is that with his first attempt Monsieur Degas has revolutionized the traditions of sculpture as he has long since shaken the conventions of painting.&quot;

Degas created a substantial number of other sculptures during a span of four decades, but they remained unseen by the public until a posthumous exhibition in 1918. Neither &quot;The Little Dancer of Fourteen Years&quot; nor any of Degas&#x27;s other sculptures were cast in bronze during the artist&#x27;s lifetime. Degas scholars have agreed that the sculptures were not created as aids to painting, although the artist habitually explored ways of linking graphic art and oil painting, drawing and pastel, sculpture and photography. Degas assigned the same significance to sculpture as to drawing: &quot;Drawing is a way of thinking, modelling another&quot;.

After Degas&#x27;s death, his heirs found in his studio 150 wax sculptures, many in disrepair. They consulted foundry owner Adrien Hébrard, who concluded that 74 of the waxes could be cast in bronze. It is assumed that, except for the &quot;Little Dancer Aged Fourteen&quot;, all Degas bronzes worldwide are cast from &quot;&quot; (i.e., cast from bronze masters). A &quot;surmoulage&quot; bronze is a bit smaller, and shows less surface detail, than its original bronze mold. The Hébrard Foundry cast the bronzes from 1919 until 1936, and closed down in 1937, shortly before Hébrard&#x27;s death.

In 2004, a little-known group of 73 plaster casts, more or less closely resembling Degas&#x27;s original wax sculptures, was presented as having been discovered among the materials bought by the Airaindor Foundry (later known as Airaindor-Valsuani) from Hébrard&#x27;s descendants. Bronzes cast from these plasters were issued between 2004 and 2016 by Airaindor-Valsuani in editions inconsistently marked and thus of unknown size. There has been substantial controversy concerning the authenticity of these plasters as well as the circumstances and date of their creation as proposed by their promoters. While several museum and academic professionals accept them as presented, most of the recognized Degas scholars have declined to comment.

==Personality and politics==

Degas, who believed that &quot;the artist must live alone, and his private life must remain unknown&quot;, lived an outwardly uneventful life. In company he was known for his wit, which could often be cruel. He was characterized as an &quot;old curmudgeon&quot; by the novelist George Moore, and he deliberately cultivated his reputation as a misanthropic bachelor.

In the 1870s, Degas gravitated towards the republican circles of Léon Gambetta. However, his republicanism did not come untainted, and signs of the prejudice and irritability which would overtake him in old age were occasionally manifested. He fired a model upon learning she was Protestant. Although Degas painted a number of Jewish subjects from 1865 to 1870, his 1879 painting &quot;Portraits at the Stock Exchange&quot; may be a watershed in his political opinions. The painting is a portrait of the Jewish banker Ernest May—who may have commissioned the work and was its first owner—and is widely regarded as anti-Semitic by modern experts. The facial features of the banker in profile have been directly compared to those in the anti-Semitic cartoons rampant in Paris at the time, while those of the background characters have drawn comparisons to Degas&#x27; earlier work &quot;Criminal Physiognomies&quot;.

The Dreyfus Affair, which divided opinion in Paris from the 1890s to the early 1900s, intensified his anti-Semitism. By the mid-1890s, he had broken off relations with all of his Jewish friends, publicly disavowed his previous friendships with Jewish artists, and refused to use models who he believed might be Jewish. He remained an outspoken anti-Semite and member of the anti-Semitic &quot;Anti-Dreyfusards&quot; until his death.

==Reputation==

During his life, public reception of Degas&#x27;s work ranged from admiration to contempt. As a promising artist in the conventional mode, Degas had a number of paintings accepted in the Salon between 1865 and 1870. These works received praise from Pierre Puvis de Chavannes and the critic Jules-Antoine Castagnary. He soon joined forces with the Impressionists, however, and rejected the rigid rules and judgments of the Salon.

Degas&#x27;s work was controversial, but was generally admired for its draftsmanship. His &quot;La Petite Danseuse de Quatorze Ans&quot;, or &quot;Little Dancer of Fourteen Years&quot;, which he displayed at the sixth Impressionist exhibition in 1881, was probably his most controversial piece; some critics decried what they thought its &quot;appalling ugliness&quot; while others saw in it a &quot;blossoming&quot;. In part Degas&#x27; originality consisted in disregarding the smooth, full surfaces and contours of classical sculpture ... [and] in garnishing his little statue with real hair and clothing made to scale like the accoutrements for a doll. These relatively &quot;real&quot; additions heightened the illusion, but they also posed searching questions, such as what can be referred to as &quot;real&quot; when art is concerned. The suite of pastels depicting nudes that Degas exhibited in the eighth Impressionist Exhibition in 1886 produced &quot;the most concentrated body of critical writing on the artist during his lifetime ... The overall reaction was positive and laudatory&quot;.

Recognized as an important artist in his lifetime, Degas is now considered &quot;one of the founders of Impressionism&quot;. Though his work crossed many stylistic boundaries, his involvement with the other major figures of Impressionism and their exhibitions, his dynamic paintings and sketches of everyday life and activities, and his bold color experiments, served to finally tie him to the Impressionist movement as one of its greatest artists.

Although Degas had no formal pupils, he greatly influenced several important painters, most notably Jean-Louis Forain, Mary Cassatt, and Walter Sickert; his greatest admirer may have been Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.

Degas&#x27;s paintings, pastels, drawings, and sculptures are on prominent display in many museums, and have been the subject of many museum exhibitions and retrospectives. Recent exhibitions include &quot;Degas: Drawings and Sketchbooks&quot; (The Morgan Library, 2010); &quot;Picasso Looks at Degas&quot; (Museu Picasso de Barcelona, 2010); &quot;Degas and the Nude&quot; (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, 2011); &quot;Degas&#x27; Method&quot; (Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, 2013); &quot;Degas&#x27;s Little Dancer&quot; (National Gallery of Art, Washington D.C., 2014); &quot;Degas: A passion for perfection&quot; (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, 2017–2018); and &quot;Manet / Degas&quot; at the Musée d&#x27;Orsay and then the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 2023 and into 2024.

== Relationship with Mary Cassatt==

In 1877, Degas invited Mary Cassatt to exhibit in the third Impressionist exhibition. He had admired a portrait (&quot;Ida&quot;) she exhibited in the Salon of 1874, and the two formed a friendship. They had much in common: they shared similar tastes in art and literature, came from affluent backgrounds, had studied painting in Italy, and both were independent, never marrying. Both regarded themselves as figure painters, and the art historian George Shackelford suggests they were influenced by the art critic Louis Edmond Duranty&#x27;s appeal in his pamphlet &quot;The New Painting&quot; for a revitalization in figure painting: &quot;Let us take leave of the stylized human body, which is treated like a vase. What we need is the characteristic modern person in his clothes, in the midst of his social surroundings, at home or out in the street.&quot;
After Cassatt&#x27;s parents and sister Lydia joined Cassatt in Paris in 1877, Degas, Cassatt, and Lydia were often to be seen at the Louvre studying artworks together. Degas produced two prints, notable for their technical innovation, depicting Cassatt at the Louvre looking at artworks while Lydia reads a guidebook. These were destined for a prints journal planned by Degas (together with Camille Pissarro and others), which never came to fruition. Cassatt frequently posed for Degas, notably for his millinery series trying on hats.

Degas introduced Cassatt to pastel and engraving, while for her part Cassatt was instrumental in helping Degas sell his paintings and promoting his reputation in the United States. Cassatt and Degas worked most closely together in the fall and winter of 1879–80 when Cassatt was mastering her printmaking technique. Degas owned a small printing press, and by day she worked at his studio using his tools and press. However, in April 1880, Degas abruptly withdrew from the prints journal they had been collaborating on, and without his support the project folded. Although they continued to visit each other until Degas&#x27; death in 1917, she never again worked with him as closely as she had over the prints journal.

Around 1884, Degas made a portrait in oils of Cassatt, &quot;Mary Cassatt Seated, Holding Cards&quot;. Stephanie Strasnick suggests that the cards are probably &quot;cartes de visite&quot;, used by artists and dealers at the time to document their work. Cassatt thought it represented her as &quot;a repugnant person&quot; and later sold it, writing to her dealer Paul Durand-Ruel in 1912 or 1913 that &quot;I would not want it known that I posed for it.&quot;

Degas was forthright in his views, as was Cassatt. They clashed over the Dreyfus affair. Cassatt later expressed satisfaction at the irony of Lousine Havermeyer&#x27;s 1915 joint exhibition of hers and Degas&#x27; work being held in aid of women&#x27;s suffrage, equally capable of affectionately repeating Degas&#x27; antifemale comments as being estranged by them (when viewing her &quot;Two Women Picking Fruit&quot; for the first time, he had commented &quot;No woman has the right to draw like that&quot;).

== Relationship with Suzanne Valadon==
Degas was a friend and admirer of Suzanne Valadon. He was the first person to purchase her art, and he taught her soft-ground etching.

He wrote her several letters, most asking her to come see him with her drawings. For example, in an undated letter he said in response to one of her letters to him (translated from French):

Every year I see this handwriting, drawn like a saw, arriving, terrible Maria. But I never see the author arrive with a box (of drawings) under her arm. And yet I am getting very old. Happy new year.R. W. Meek’s historical fiction novel, &quot;The Dream Collector: Sabrine &amp; Sigmund Freud&quot;, imagines Edgar Degas&#x27;s friendship with Suzanne Valadon.

== Legacy with Édouard Manet ==
In 2023, The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York exhibited a two-person exhibition of Degas and Manet.

<doc id="63147" wikidata="Q4376681" url="?curid=63147" title="President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State">
<text>The president of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State () was the head of government or prime minister of the Irish Free State which existed from 1922 to 1937. He was the chairman of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, the Free State&#x27;s cabinet. The president was appointed by the governor-general, upon the nomination of Dáil Éireann (the lower house of parliament) and had to enjoy the confidence of the Dáil to remain in office. The office was succeeded by that of taoiseach, though subsequent Taoisigh are numbered from the first president of the Executive.

==Appointment==
The president of the Executive Council was nominated by the Dáil and then formally appointed by the governor-general, though the governor-general was bound by constitutional convention to honour the Dáil&#x27;s choice.

On paper, executive power was vested in the governor-general, with the Executive Council empowered to &quot;aide and advise&quot; him. However, it also stipulated that the governor-general could only exercise his powers in accordance with constitutional practice established in Canada. Thus, the governor-general was required to exercise his powers on the advice of the Executive Council, making the president of the council the Free State&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; political leader.

Once he had appointed the president, the governor-general appointed the remaining members of the Executive Council on the president&#x27;s nomination. The president had the freedom to choose any vice-president (deputy prime minister) he wished from among the members of the Dáil, but the remainder of the cabinet had to be approved by a vote of consent in the Dáil before they could assume office. If he ceased to &quot;retain the support of a majority in Dáil Éireann,&quot; the president, along with his cabinet, was obliged to resign, but could continue to serve as acting president until the appointment of a successor.

The method of appointment of the president of the Executive Council was through a commission of the monarch or governor-general, either the leader of the party with a majority of seats in the lower house of parliament or, if no party commanded an absolute majority, whichever leader he believed would be best able to avoid a vote of no confidence.

==Powers==
The office of the president of the Executive Council was less powerful than either its modern equivalent, the office of taoiseach, or the offices of most modern prime ministers in nations that follow the parliamentary system of government. In particular, the powers of the president were subject to two important limitations:

*He could not advise the governor-ceneral to dismiss a minister. Rather, the Executive Council had to be disbanded and reformed as a whole in order to replace a single minister.
*He could not request a dissolution of parliament on his own initiative. This could only be done by the Executive Council acting collectively.

The result of these restrictions was, according to Brian Farrell, that the president of the Executive Council was closer to being the Executive Council&#x27;s chairman or presiding officer, than its dominant leader. Nonetheless a strong president could exercise authority beyond the limits laid down in the 1922 constitution. The president&#x27;s weak position arose from the fact that the status of his office was modelled on that of the prime minister of the United Kingdom before 1918. Until 1918, the British prime minister&#x27;s powers had been theoretically quite limited and, as a member of the cabinet, the office-holder was regarded strictly as . Under Prime Minister David Lloyd George, however, from 1918 onwards, the powers of the office increased, as Lloyd George unilaterally arrogated to himself a number of powers that had previously belonged to the Cabinet collectively, including, most significantly, the right to seek a parliamentary dissolution.

In 1931, the Statute of Westminster 1931 removed nearly all of the UK Parliament&#x27;s authority to legislate for the Irish Free State, which effectively gave the Free State &quot;de jure&quot; independence. Soon after the Statute&#x27;s passage, the Free State sought, and was granted, the right to have an Irish minister formally advise the King in the exercise of his powers and functions in the Irish Free State, to the exclusion of British ministers. This had the effect of giving the president of the Executive Council the right to advise the king in his capacity as His Majesty&#x27;s Irish prime minister.

==History==
The office of president of the Executive Council came into being on 6 December 1922 with the establishment of the Irish Free State, replacing the previous offices of president of Dáil Éireann and chairman of the Provisional Government. Only two individuals held the office of president of the Executive Council during its existence: W. T. Cosgrave, until 1932, and Éamon de Valera thereafter. Under a constitutional amendment passed in 1936 and legislation passed in 1937 the office of governor-general was abolished, with most of his powers being transferred to the Executive Council. At the same time, the president of the Executive Council ceased to be formally appointed by the governor-general, thenceforth simply being elected by the Dáil.

The Irish Free State was reconstituted as &#x27;Ireland&#x27; on 29 December 1937, when the present-day Constitution of Ireland came into effect. The new Constitution abolished the office of president of the Executive Council, replacing it with that of taoiseach (prime minister – literally meaning &quot;Chieftain&quot; or &quot;Leader&quot;). The Taoiseach occupies a more powerful position than the president of the Executive Council did and has authority both to dismiss ministers individually and to request a dissolution of parliament on his own initiative.

<text>Vaslav or Vatslav Nijinsky (; , ; , ; 12 March 1889/18908 April 1950) was a Russian ballet dancer and choreographer of Polish ancestry. He is regarded as the greatest male dancer of the early 20th century.

Nijinsky was celebrated for his virtuosity and for the depth and intensity of his characterizations. He could dance &quot;en pointe&quot;, a rare skill among male dancers at the time, and was admired for his seemingly gravity-defying leaps.

He was introduced to dance by his parents, who were senior dancers with the travelling Setov opera company, and his early childhood was spent touring with the company. His elder brother, Stanislav, and younger sister, Bronislava Nijinska, known to intimates as Bronia, also became dancers; Bronia also became a choreographer, working closely with him for much of his career.

At age nine, Nijinsky was accepted at the Imperial Ballet School in St. Petersburg, the pre-eminent ballet school in the world. In 1907, he graduated and became a member of the Imperial Ballet, starting in the rank of coryphée instead of in the corps de ballet, and already taking starring roles.

In 1909, he joined the Ballets Russes, a new ballet company started by Sergei Diaghilev. The impresario took the Russian ballets to Paris, where high-quality productions such as those of the Imperial Ballet were not known. Nijinsky became the company&#x27;s star male dancer, causing an enormous stir amongst audiences whenever he performed. In ordinary life, he appeared unremarkable and was withdrawn in conversation.

Diaghilev and Nijinsky became lovers; the Ballets Russes gave Nijinsky the chance to expand his art and experiment with dance and choreography; he created new directions for male dancers while becoming internationally famous. 

In 1912, Nijinsky began choreographing original ballets, including &quot;L&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot; (1912) to music by Claude Debussy, &quot;Le Sacre du Printemps&quot; (1913) to music by Igor Stravinsky, &quot;Jeux&quot; (1913), and &quot;Till Eulenspiegel&quot; (1916). &quot;Faune,&quot; considered one of the first modern ballets, caused controversy because of its sexually suggestive final scene. At the premiere of &quot;Le Sacre du Printemps&quot;, fights broke out in the audience between those who loved and hated this startling new style of ballet and music. Nijinsky originally conceived &quot;Jeux&quot; as a flirtatious interaction among three males, although Diaghilev insisted it be danced by one male and two females.

In 1913, Nijinsky married Hungarian Romola de Pulszky while on tour with the company in South America. The marriage caused a break with Diaghilev, who soon dismissed Nijinsky from the company. The couple had two daughters together, Kyra and Tamara Nijinska.

With no alternative employer available, Nijinsky tried to form his own company, but this was not a success. He was interned in Budapest, Hungary, during World War I, under house arrest until 1916. After intervention by Diaghilev and several international leaders, he was allowed to go to New York for an American tour with the Ballets Russes.

Nijinsky became increasingly mentally unstable with the stresses of having to manage tours himself and deprived of opportunities to dance. After a tour of South America in 1917, and due to travel difficulties imposed by the war, the family settled in St. Moritz, Switzerland. His mental condition deteriorated; he was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1919 and committed to a mental asylum. For the next 30 years, he was in and out of institutions, never dancing in public again.

==Biography==

Vaslav Nijinsky was born in 1889 or 1890 in Kiev, Russian Empire (now Ukraine), as Wacław Niżyński, to ethnic Polish parents, touring dancers Tomasz Niżyński (b. 7 March 1862) and Eleonora Bereda (b. 28 December 1856). Nijinsky was christened in Warsaw. He identified himself as Polish although he grew up in the interior of Russia with his parents and he had difficulty speaking Polish.

Eleanora, along with her two brothers and two sisters, was orphaned while still a child. She started to earn a living as an extra in Warsaw&#x27;s Grand Theatre Ballet (Polish: &quot;Teatr Wielki&quot;), becoming a full member of the company at age thirteen. In 1868 her talent was spotted and she moved to Kiev as a solo dancer. Tomasz Niżyński also attended the Wielki Theatre school, becoming a soloist there. At age 18 he accepted a soloist contract with the Odessa Theatre. The two met, married in May 1884 and settled into a career with the traveling Setov opera company. Tomasz was &quot;premier danseur&quot;, and Eleanora a soloist. Eleanora continued to tour and dance while having three children, sons Stanislav (b. 29 December 1886 in Tiflis) and Vaslav; and daughter Bronislava (&#x27;Bronia&#x27;, b. 8 January 1891 in Minsk). She had depression, which may have been a genetic vulnerability shared in a different form by her son Vaslav. Both boys received training from their father and appeared in an amateur &quot;Hopak&quot; production in Odessa in 1894.

After Josef Setov died about 1894, the company disbanded. Thomas attempted to run his own company, but was not successful. He and his family became itinerant dancers, the children appearing in the Christmas show at Nizhny Novgorod. In 1897 Thomas and Eleanora separated after Thomas had fallen in love with another dancer, Rumiantseva, while touring in Finland. Eleanora moved to 20 Mokhovaya Street in St Petersburg with her children. She persuaded a friend from the Wielki Theatre, Victor Stanislas Gillert, who was at the time teaching at the Imperial Ballet School, to help get Vaslav into the school. He arranged for the noted teacher Enrico Cecchetti to sponsor the application. Bronia entered the school two years after Vaslav. Their elder brother Stanislav had had a fall from a window when young and seemed to have suffered some brain damage. Vaslav and Bronia, just two years apart, became very close as they grew. As he got older, Stanislav became increasingly mentally unstable and would have fierce tantrums. He was admitted to an asylum for the insane in 1902.

===Imperial Ballet School===

In 1900, Nijinsky joined the Imperial Ballet School, where he initially studied dance under Sergei Legat and his brother Nikolai. He studied mime under Pavel Gerdt; all three men were principal dancers at the Imperial Russian Ballet. At the end of the one year probationary period, his teachers agreed upon Nijinsky&#x27;s exceptional dancing ability and he was confirmed as a boarder at the school. He appeared in supporting parts in classical ballets such as &quot;Faust&quot;, as a mouse in &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, a page in &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; and &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, and won the Didelot scholarship. During his first year, his academic studies had covered work he had already done, so his relatively poor results had not been so much noted. He did well in subjects which interested him, but not otherwise.

In 1902 he was warned that only the excellence of his dancing had prevented his expulsion from the school for poor results. This laxity was compounded through his school years by Nijinsky&#x27;s frequently being chosen as an extra in various productions, forcing him to be away from classrooms for rehearsals and to spend nights at performances. He was teased for being Polish, and nicknamed &quot;Japonczek&quot; for his faintly Japanese looks at a time Russia was at war with Japan. Some classmates were envious and resented his outstanding dancing ability. In 1901 one of the class deliberately caused him to fall, leading to his concussion and being in a coma for four days.

 became his teacher in 1902, and awarded him the highest grade he had ever given to a student. He was given student parts in command performances in front of the Tsar of &quot;Paquita&quot;, &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; and &quot;The Little Humpbacked Horse&quot;. In music he studied piano, flute, balalaika and accordion, receiving good marks. He had a good ability to hear and play music on the piano, though his sight reading was relatively poor. Against this, his behaviour was sometimes boisterous and wild, resulting in his expulsion from the school in 1903 for an incident involving students shooting at the hats of passers-by with catapults while being driven to the Mariinsky Theatre in carriages. He was readmitted to the school as a non-resident after a sound beating and restored to his previous position after a month&#x27;s probation.

In 1904, at the age of 14, Nijinsky was selected by the great choreographer Marius Petipa to dance a principal role in what proved to be the choreographer&#x27;s last ballet, &quot;La Romance d&#x27;un Bouton de rose et d&#x27;un Papillon.&quot; The work was never performed due to the outbreak of the Russo-Japanese War.

On Sunday, 9 January 1905, Nijinsky was caught in the Bloody Sunday massacre in St. Petersburg, where a group of petitioners led by Father Gapon attempted to present their petition to the Czar. Soldiers fired upon the crowd, leading to an estimated 1000 casualties. Nijinsky was caught in the crowd on Nevsky Prospect and propelled toward the Winter Palace. Imperial cavalry troops charged the crowd, leaving him with a head wound. The following day, he returned to the scene with a friend whose sister was missing. She was never found.

Nijinsky became calmer and more serious as he grew older, but continued to make few friends, which continued through his life. His reserve and apparent dullness made him unappealing to others except when he danced.
The 1905 annual student show included a pas de deux from &quot;The Persian Market&quot;, danced by Nijinsky and Sofia Fedorova. Oboukhov amended the dance to show off Nijinsky&#x27;s abilities, drawing gasps and then spontaneous applause in the middle of the performance with his first jump.

In 1906, he danced in the Mariinsky production of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, in a ballet sequence choreographed by Michel Fokine. He was congratulated by the director of the Imperial Ballet and offered a place in the company although he was a year from graduation. Nijinsky chose to continue his studies. He tried his hand at choreography, with a children&#x27;s opera, &quot;Cinderella&quot;, with music by another student, Boris Asafyev. At Christmas, he played the King of the Mice in &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;. At his graduation performance in April 1907, he partnered Elizaveta Gerdt, in a pas de deux choreographed by Fokine. He was congratulated by &quot;prima ballerina&quot; Mathilde Kschessinska of the Imperial Ballet, who invited him to partner her. His future career with the Imperial Ballet was guaranteed to begin at the mid-rank level of coryphée, rather than in the corps de ballet. He graduated second in his class, with top marks in dancing, art and music.

===Early career===
Nijinsky spent his summer after graduation rehearsing and then performing at Krasnoe Selo in a makeshift theatre with an audience mainly of army officers. These performances frequently included members of the Imperial family and other nobility, whose support and interest were essential to a career. Each dancer who performed before the Tsar received a gold watch inscribed with the Imperial Eagle. Buoyed by Nijinsky&#x27;s salary, his new earnings from giving dance classes, and his sister Bronia&#x27;s employment with the ballet company, the family moved to a larger flat on Torgovaya Ulitsa. The new season at the Mariinsky theatre began in September 1907, with Nijinsky employed as coryphée on a salary of 780 roubles per year.

He appeared with Sedova, Lydia Kyasht and Karsavina. Kchessinska partnered him in &quot;La Fille Mal Gardée&quot;, where he succeeded in an atypical role for him involving humour and flirtation. Designer Alexandre Benois proposed a ballet based upon &quot;Le Pavillon d&#x27;Armide&quot;, choreographed by Fokine to music by Nikolai Tcherepnin. Nijinsky had a minor role, but it allowed him to show off his technical abilities with leaps and pirouettes. The partnership of Fokine, Benois and Nijinsky was repeated throughout his career. Shortly after, he upstaged his own performance, appearing in the &quot;Bluebird&quot; pas de deux from the &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, partnering Lydia Kyasht. The Mariinsky audience was deeply familiar with the piece, but exploded with enthusiasm for his performance and his appearing to fly, an effect he continued to have on audiences with the piece during his career.
In subsequent years, Nijinsky was given several soloist roles at the Mariinsky. In 1910, Mathilde Kschessinska selected Nijinsky to dance in a revival of Petipa&#x27;s &quot;Le Talisman.&quot; Nijinsky created a sensation in the role of the Wind God Vayou.

===Ballets Russes===
A turning point for Nijinsky was his meeting the Russian Sergei Diaghilev, a celebrated and highly innovative producer of ballet and opera, as well as art exhibitions. He concentrated on promoting Russian visual and musical art abroad, particularly in Paris. The 1908 season of colorful Russian ballets and operas, works mostly new to the West, was a great success, leading him to plan a new tour for 1909 with a new name for his company, the now famous Ballets Russes. He worked closely with choreographer Michel Fokine and artist Léon Bakst, and later with other contemporary artists and composers. Nijinsky and Diaghilev became lovers for a time, and Diaghilev was deeply involved in directing and managing Nijinsky&#x27;s career.

===1909 opening season===
During the winter of 1908/9, Diaghilev started planning for the 1909 Paris tour of opera and ballet. He collected a team including designers Alexandre Benois and Léon Bakst, painters Nicholas Roerich and Konstantin Korovin, composers Alexander Glazunov and Nikolai Tcherepnin, regisseurs and Alexander Sanine and other ballet enthusiasts. As a friend and as a leading dancer, Nijinsky was part of the group. His sister wrote that he felt intimidated by the illustrious and aristocratic company. Fokine was asked to start rehearsals for the existing &quot;Le Pavillon d&#x27;Armide&quot; and for &quot;Les Sylphides&quot;, an expanded version of his &quot;Chopiniana&quot;. Fokine favoured expanding the existing &quot;Une Nuit d&#x27;Egypte&quot; for a ballet.

Diaghilev accepted the idea of an Egyptian theme, but he required a comprehensive rewrite based on new music, by which Fokine created a new ballet &quot;Cléopâtre&quot;. To round out the program, they needed another ballet. Without sufficient time to compose a new work, they decided on a suite of popular dances, to be called &quot;Le Festin&quot;. Anna Pavlova, Karsavina and Nijinsky were chosen as principal dancers. Fokine insisted that Ida Rubenstein would appear as Cleopatra, and Nijinsky insisted that his sister should have a part. Fokine noted Nijinsky&#x27;s great ability at learning a dance and precisely what a choreographer wanted. Diaghilev departed for Paris in early 1909 to make arrangements, which were immediately complicated on the day of his return, 22 February 1909, by the death of Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovitch, who had sponsored an application by Diaghilev for an imperial subsidy of 100,000 roubles for the tour.
Rehearsals started on 2 April at the Hermitage Theatre, which the company had been granted special permission to use, along with loans of scenery. No sooner had rehearsals started that the permission was withdrawn, disappearing as had the imperial subsidy. Diaghilev managed to raise some money in Russia, but he had to rely significantly on Gabriel Astruc, who had been arranging theatres and publicity on behalf of the company in France, to also provide finance. Plans to include Opera had to be dropped because of the lack of finances, and logistical difficulties in obtaining necessary scenery at short notice and for free.

Diaghilev and Nijinsky travelled to Paris ahead of the rest of the company. Initially Nijinsky stayed at the Hôtel Daunou. He moved to the Hôtel de Hollande together with Diaghilev and his secretary, Alexis Mavrine, before the arrival of the others. Members of the company had noticed Diaghilev keeping a particularly proprietorial eye on Nijinsky during rehearsals in Russia. They took the travel arrangements and accommodation as confirmation of a relationship. Prince Lvov had visited Nijinsky&#x27;s mother in St Petersburg, telling her tearfully that he would no longer be taking a special interest in her son, but he advanced a significant sum to Diaghilev towards the tour&#x27;s expenses. Mavrine was known to have been Diaghilev&#x27;s lover, but left the tour together with Olga Pedorova shortly after it had begun.

The season of colorful Russian ballets and operas, works mostly new to the West, was a great success. The Paris seasons of the Ballets Russes were an artistic and social sensation; setting trends in art, dance, music and fashion for the next decade. Nijinsky&#x27;s unique talent showed in Fokine&#x27;s pieces such as &quot;Le Pavillon d&#x27;Armide&quot; (music by Nikolai Tcherepnin); &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (music by Anton Arensky and other Russian composers) and a divertissement &quot;La Fête&quot;. His expressive execution of a pas de deux from &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; (Tchaikovsky) was a tremendous success.

===Later seasons===
In 1910, he performed in &quot;Giselle&quot;, and Fokine&#x27;s ballets &quot;Carnaval&quot; and &quot;Scheherazade&quot; (based on the orchestral suite by Rimsky-Korsakov). His portrayal of &quot;Petrushka,&quot; the puppet with a soul, was a remarkable display of his expressive ability to portray characters. His partnership with Tamara Karsavina, also of the Mariinsky Theatre, was legendary, and they have been called the &quot;most exemplary artists of the time&quot;.

In January 1911 he danced in &quot;Giselle&quot; at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg for the Imperial Ballet, with the Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna in attendance. His costume, which had been designed by Benois and used in Paris before, caused a scandal, as he danced in tights without the then-common trousers. He refused to apologize and was dismissed from the Imperial Ballet. It is possible that he was not altogether unhappy about this development, as he was now free to concentrate on the Ballets Russes.

===Ballets choreographed by Nijinsky===
Nijinsky took the creative reins and choreographed ballets which pushed boundaries and stirred controversy. His ballets were &quot;L&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot; (&quot;The Afternoon of a Faun&quot;, based on Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Prélude à l&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot;) (1912); &quot;Jeux&quot; (1913); and &quot;Till Eulenspiegel&quot; (1916). These introduced his audiences to the new direction of modern dance. As the title character in &quot;L&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot;, in the final tableau, he mimed masturbation with the scarf of a nymph, causing a scandal; he was defended by such artists as Auguste Rodin, Odilon Redon and Marcel Proust. Nijinsky&#x27;s new trends in dance caused a riotous reaction at the Théâtre de Champs-Élysées when they premiered in Paris.

In &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; (&quot;Le Sacre du Printemps&quot;), with music by Igor Stravinsky (1913), Nijinsky created choreography that exceeded the limits of traditional ballet and propriety. The radically angular movements expressed the heart of Stravinsky&#x27;s radically modern score. Violence broke out in the audience as &quot;The Rite of Spring&quot; premiered. The theme of the ballet, based on pagan myths, was a young maiden who sacrificed herself by dancing until she died. The theme, the difficult and challenging music of Stravinsky, and Nijinsky&#x27;s choreography, led to a violent uproar; Diaghilev was pleased with the notoriety.

===Marriage===
Nijinsky&#x27;s work in choreographing ballets had proved controversial. They were time-consuming to rehearse and badly received by critics. Diaghilev asked him to begin preparing a new ballet, &quot;La Légende de Joseph,&quot; based on the Bible. Aside from Nijinsky&#x27;s difficulties, Diaghilev came under pressure from financial backers and theatre owners who wanted productions more in the style of previous successful work. Although Diaghilev had become unhappy with Fokine&#x27;s work, thinking he had lost his originality, he returned to him for two new ballets, including &quot;Joseph&quot;. Relations between Diaghilev and Nijinsky had deteriorated under the stress of Nijinsky&#x27;s becoming principal choreographer and his pivotal role in the company&#x27;s financial success. Diaghilev could not face Nijinsky to tell him personally that he would no longer be choreographing the ballet &quot;Joseph&quot;, but instead asked his sister Bronia Nijinska to deliver the bad news.

The company was to embark on a tour of South America in August 1913. Nijinska, who had always worked closely with her brother and supported him, could not accompany the tour because she had married in July 1912 and become pregnant. In October 1912 their father had died while on tour with his dance company, causing another stress for the siblings. Diaghilev did not accompany the South American tour, claiming he had been told that he would die on the ocean. Others have suggested the reason had more to do with wanting to spend time away from Nijinsky and enjoy a holiday in Venice, &quot;where perhaps adventures with pretty dark-eyed boys awaited him&quot;. Nijinsky set sail on a 21-day sea voyage in a state of turmoil and without the people who had been his closest advisers in recent years.
The tour party included Romola de Pulszky, whose father Count Charles Pulszky was a Hungarian politician, and mother Emilia Márkus was a noted actress. In March 1912 the recently engaged Romola was taken to see the Ballets Russes in Budapest by her prospective mother-in-law and was greatly impressed. Nijinsky had not been performing, but she returned the following day and saw him: &quot;An electric shock passed through the entire audience. Intoxicated, entranced, gasping for breath, we followed this superhuman being... the power, the featherweight lightness, the steel-like strength, the suppleness of his movements...&quot; Romola broke off her engagement and began following the Ballets Russes across Europe, attending every performance she could. Nijinsky was difficult to approach, being always accompanied by a &#x27;minder&#x27;. However, Romola befriended Adolf Bolm, who had previously visited her mother, thereby gaining access to the company and backstage. She and Nijinsky shared no common language; she spoke French but he knew only a little, so many of their early conversations involved an interpreter. When first introduced to her, he gained the impression she was a Hungarian prima ballerina and was friendly. Discovering his mistake, he ignored her thereafter.

Romola did not give up. She persuaded Diaghilev that her amorous interests lay with Bolm, that she was rich and interested in supporting ballet. He allowed her to take ballet lessons with Enrico Cecchetti, who accompanied the troupe coaching the dancers. Nijinsky objected to her taking class with the professionals. Cecchetti warned her against becoming involved with Nijinsky (describing him as &quot;like a sun that pours forth light but never warms&quot;), but Diaghilev&#x27;s endorsement meant that Nijinsky paid her some attention. Romola took every opportunity to be near Nijinsky, booking train compartments or cabins close to his. She was likely warned that he was homosexual by Marie Rambert, whom Romola befriended and who was also in love with Nijinsky. As a devout Catholic, she prayed for his conversion to heterosexuality. She referred to him as &quot;Le Petit&quot;, and wanted to have his child.

On board ship, Romola had a cabin in first class, which allowed her to keep a watch on Nijinsky&#x27;s door, while most of the company were exiled to second class. She befriended his masseur and was rewarded with a rundown on his musculature. Determined to take every opportunity, she succeeded in spending more and more time in his company. The unexpected friendliness was noticed by Baron de Gunsbourg, an investor in the Ballets Russes, who had been tasked with keeping an eye on the company. Instead of reporting to Diaghilev on what was occurring, Gunsbourg agreed to act on Nijinsky&#x27;s behalf in presenting a proposal of marriage to Romola. Romola thought a cruel joke was being played on her, and ran off to her cabin crying. However, Nijinsky asked her again, in broken French and mime, and she accepted. Although Gunsbourg had a financial interest in Ballets Russes, he was also interested in forming his own company, and a split between Diaghilev and his star dancer might have presented him with an opportunity.
When the ship stopped at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the couple went straight to buy wedding rings. Adolph Bolm warned Romola against proceeding, saying &quot;It will ruin your life&quot;. Gunsbourg hurried to arrange the marriage, getting permission by telegram from Romola&#x27;s mother. A quick wedding could take place once the ship arrived at Buenos Aires, Argentina; the couple were married on 10 September 1913 and the event was announced to the world&#x27;s press. Back in Europe, Diaghilev &quot;gave himself to a wild orgy of dissipation...Sobbing shamelessly in Russian despair, he bellowed accusations and recriminations; he cursed Nijinsky&#x27;s ingratitude, Romola&#x27;s treachery, and his own stupidity&quot;.

As the company was due to start performing immediately, the couple had no honeymoon. A few days after the marriage, Nijinsky tried to teach Romola some ballet, but she was not interested. &quot;I asked her to learn dancing because for me dancing was the highest thing in the world&quot;, &quot;I realized that I had made a mistake, but the mistake was irreparable. I had put myself in the hands of someone who did not love me.&quot; Romola and Nijinsky did not share accommodations until after the season was safely underway, when she was eventually invited to join him in separate bedrooms in his hotel suite. She &quot;almost cried with thankfulness&quot; that he showed no interest in making love on their wedding night.

===Dismissal from Ballets Russes===
On returning to Paris, Nijinsky anticipated returning to work on new ballets, but Diaghilev did not meet him. Eventually he sent a telegram to Nijinsky informing him that he was no longer employed by the Ballets Russes. Nijinsky had missed a performance in Rio when Romola was ill, and only in the case of a dancer&#x27;s own illness, certified by a doctor, was the dancer allowed to miss a performance. Diaghilev also usually dismissed dancers who married. This was perhaps beside the point, since Nijinsky had never had a contract, nor wages, all his expenses having been paid by Diaghilev. His mother also received an allowance of 500 francs per month (other senior dancers had received 200,000 francs for a six-month season). Fokine was re-employed by Diaghilev as choreographer and premier danseur, accepting on the condition that none of Nijinsky&#x27;s ballets would be performed. Leonide Massine joined the company as the new attractive young lead for &quot;Joseph&quot;.

The Ballets Russes had lost its most famous and crowd-pulling dancer, but Nijinsky&#x27;s position was even more difficult. He appears not to have appreciated that his marriage would result in a break with Diaghilev&#x27;s company, although many others immediately expected this would be the result. The Ballets Russes and the Imperial Russian ballet were the pre-eminent ballet companies in the world and uniquely had permanent companies of dancers staging full-scale new productions. Nijinsky now was &quot;an experimental artist. He needed roles that would extend his gifts, and above all, he needed to choreograph. For these things he did need the Ballets Russes, which at that time was the only forward-thinking ballet company in the world.&quot;

Not only had Nijinsky previously left the Imperial ballet on doubtful terms, but he had not been granted exemption from compulsory military service in Russia, something that was normally given to its dancers. He could find only two offers, one a position with the Paris Opera, which would not start for more than a year; the other to take a ballet company to London for eight weeks to perform as part of a mixed bill at the Palace Theatre. Anna Pavlova sent him a caustic telegram, reminding him that he had disapproved some years before when she had appeared there in vaudeville. On another occasion, he had told a reporter, &quot;One thing I am determined not to do, and that is to go on the music-hall stage&quot;.

Bronia was still in St Petersburg following the birth of her child, and Nijinsky asked her to be part of his new company. She was glad to do so, being concerned at how well he could cope without his customary supporters. When she arrived, there was friction between her and Romola: Bronia was critical that the new central figure in her brother&#x27;s life showed so little organisational ability; Romola resented the closeness between brother and sister both in their shared language and in ability to work together in dance. The final company had only three experienced dancers: Nijinsky and Bronia plus her husband. Scenery was late, Fokine refused to allow the use of his ballets, there was inadequate time to rehearse, and Nijinsky became &quot;more and more nervous and distraught&quot;. Diaghilev came to the opening night in March 1914.

The audience divided between those who had never seen ballet, who objected to the delays necessary for scene changes, and those who had seen Nijinsky before, who generally felt something was lacking (&quot;He no longer danced like a god&quot;). On another night, when the orchestra played music during the scene change so as to calm the audience, Nijinsky, having expressly banned this, flew into a rage and was discovered half dressed and screaming in his dressing room. He had to be calmed down enough to perform. He jumped on a stagehand who had flirted with Romola (&quot;I had never seen Vaslav like that&quot;). A new program was to be performed for the third week, but a packed house had to be told that Nijinsky was ill with a high temperature and could not perform. He missed three days, and the management had had enough. The show was cancelled, and Nijinsky was left with a considerable financial loss. Newspapers reported a nervous breakdown. His physical vulnerability had been aggravated by the great stress.

===Later life===
Romola was pregnant, so the couple returned to Budapest, Austro-Hungary, to his mother-in-law Emilia Markus&#x27; house. Their daughter Kyra was born on 19 June 1914. With the start of the Great War (World War I), Nijinsky was classified as an enemy Russian citizen. He was confined to house arrest in Budapest and could not leave the country. The war made problems for the Ballets Russes too; the company had difficulty recruiting dancers and Fokine returned to Russia.

Diaghilev started negotiations in October 1914 for Nijinsky to work again for the company, but could not obtain release of the dancer until 1916. The complex negotiations included a prisoner exchange with the United States, and agreement that Nijinsky would dance and choreograph for the Ballets Russes&#x27; tour. King Alfonso XIII of Spain, Queen Alexandra of Denmark, Dowager Russian Empress Marie Feodorovna, Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, Pope Benedict XV and President Wilson at the urging of Otto Kahn all interceded on his behalf.

Nijinsky arrived in New York on 4 April 1916. The tour had already started in January with a number of problems: &quot;Faun&quot; was considered too sexually explicit and had to be amended; &quot;Scheherazade&quot;, including an interracial orgy, did not appeal to Americans; and ballet aficionados were calling for Nijinsky. Romola took over negotiations, demanding that Diaghilev pay Nijinsky for the years he had been unpaid by the Ballets Russes before he would dance in New York. This was settled after another week&#x27;s delay by a down payment of $13,000 against the $90,000 claimed, plus a fee of $1000 for each performance in America.

Negotiations with Otto Kahn of the New York Metropolitan Opera led to an additional tour of the US being agreed to for the autumn. Kahn did not get on with Diaghilev and insisted Nijinsky should manage the tour. Massine and Diaghilev returned to Europe, leaving Nijinsky to dance and manage a company of more than 100 for a salary of $60,000. Nijinsky was also to prepare two new ballets. Rehearsals for &quot;Till Eulenspiegel&quot; did not go well; Nijinsky&#x27;s poor communication skills meant that he could not explain to dancers what he wanted. He would explode into rages. Pierre Monteux, the conductor, refused to take part in performances because he did not want to be associated with failure. Nijinsky twisted his ankle, postponing the season&#x27;s opening for a week and his own appearance by two weeks. Rehearsals for &quot;Eulenspiegel&quot; had not been completed, and it had to be improvised during its first performance. It was still well received, and Nijinsky&#x27;s performance in &quot;Faun &quot; was considered better than Massine&#x27;s. As the tour progressed, Nijinsky&#x27;s performances received steady acclaim, although his management was haphazard and contributed to the tour&#x27;s loss of $250,000.

His last professional public performance was during a South American tour, with pianist Arthur Rubinstein in a benefit in Montevideo for the Red Cross on 30 September 1917, at age twenty-eight. Rubinstein wept when he saw Nijinsky&#x27;s confusion that night. It was around this time that signs of his schizophrenia had become apparent to members of the company, including Bourman. Nijinsky and his wife moved to St. Moritz, Switzerland, where he tried to recover from the stresses of the tour. Also in 1917, Bronia and Vaslav lost their older brother Stanislav, who died in a hospital in Petrograd. Accounts vary as to the cause of death. He had been institutionalized for many years.

On Sunday, 19 January 1919, Vaslav Nijinsky made one last public appearance: a solo improvised performance at the Suvretta House in St Moritz. The crowd consisted of skiers, hotel guests, wealthy visitors from abroad, war refugees, and assorted social climbers. Bertha Asseo, a family friend, played the piano. Vaslav stood still for a good while before he finally started moving. His dance reflected a wide range of feelings, from sadness and anger to joyfulness. His strong feelings towards the devastation of the war, and people who did nothing to stop it, were also reflected in his dance.

Nijinsky&#x27;s diary, which he wrote from January to early March 1919, expressed his great fear of hospitalization and confinement. He filled it with drawings of eyes, as he felt himself under scrutiny, by his wife, a young doctor Frenkel, and others. Finally, Romola arranged a consultation in Zurich with the psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler in 1919, asking her mother and stepfather for help in getting Nijinsky there. His fears were realized; he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and committed to Burghölzli. After a few days, he was transferred to the Bellevue Sanatorium, &quot;a luxurious and humane establishment directed at that time by Ludwig Binswanger.&quot; In 1920, Nijinsky&#x27;s second daughter Tamara was born. She never saw him dance in public.

For the next 30 years, Nijinsky was in and out of psychiatric hospitals and asylums. During 1945, after the end of the war, after Romola had moved with him to Vienna, he encountered a group of Russian soldiers in an encampment, playing traditional folk tunes on a balalaika and other instruments. Inspired by the music and hearing a language from his youth, he started dancing, astounding the men with his skills. Drinking and laughing with them helped him start to speak again. He had maintained long periods of almost absolute silence during his years of illness. His wife Romola had protected them by staying for a time at the border of Hungary and Austria, trying to keep out of major areas of fighting.

From 1947, Nijinsky lived in Virginia Water, Surrey, England, with his wife. He died from kidney failure at a clinic in London on 8 April 1950 and was buried in London. In 1953, his body was moved to Montmartre Cemetery in Paris and reinterred beside the graves of Gaétan Vestris, Théophile Gautier, and Emma Livry.

==Legacy==
Nijinsky&#x27;s daughter Kyra married the Ukrainian conductor Igor Markevitch, and they had a son named Vaslav. The marriage ended in divorce.

His second daughter Tamara Nijinsky grew up with her maternal grandmother, never getting to see her father dance. Later she served as executive director of the Vaslav &amp; Romola Nijinsky Foundation, founded by her mother, to preserve art and writing associated with her parents, and her father&#x27;s dances.

Nijinsky&#x27;s &quot;Diary&quot; was written during the six weeks in 1919 he spent in Switzerland before being committed to the asylum to Zurich. It reflected the decline of his household into chaos. He elevated feeling and action in his writing. It combined elements of autobiography with appeals for compassion toward the less fortunate.
Discovering the three notebooks of the diary years later, plus another with letters to a variety of people, his wife published a bowdlerized version of the diary in 1936, translated into English by Jennifer Mattingly. She deleted about 40 per cent of the diary, especially references to bodily functions, sex, and homosexuality, recasting Nijinsky as an &quot;involuntary homosexual&quot;. She also removed some of his more unflattering references to her and others close to their household. She moved sections around, obscuring the &quot;march of events&quot; obvious in the original version and toning down some of the odder portions, including trying to distinguish between sections in which he writes as God and others as himself. (In the original all such sections are written the same.)

In 1995, the first unexpurgated edition of &quot;The Diary of Vaslav Nijinsky&quot; was published, edited by &quot;New Yorker&quot; dance critic Joan Acocella and translated by Kyril FitzLyon. Acocella notes that the diary displays three elements common to schizophrenia: &quot;delusions, disorganized language, and disorganized behavior.&quot; It also demonstrates that Nijinsky&#x27;s thought was showing a &quot;breakdown in selective attention;&quot; his associations would connect in ever-widening circles. A &quot;New York Times&quot; review said, &quot;How ironic that in erasing the real ugliness of his insanity, the old version silenced not only Nijinsky&#x27;s true voice but the magnificently gifted body from which it came. And how fortunate we are to have them both restored.&quot;

Nijinsky is immortalized in numerous still photographs, many of them by E. O. Hoppé, who photographed the Ballets Russes seasons in London extensively between 1909 and 1921. No film exists of Nijinsky dancing; Diaghilev never allowed the Ballets Russes to be filmed because he felt that the quality of film at the time could never capture the artistry of his dancers. He believed that the reputation of the company would suffer if people saw their performance only in the short, jerky films of the period.

<text>The Pastry War (; ), also known as the first French intervention in Mexico or the first Franco-Mexican war (1838–1839), began in November 1838 with the naval blockade of some Mexican ports and the capture of the fortress of San Juan de Ulúa in the port of Veracruz by French forces sent by King Louis Philippe I. It ended in March 1839 with a British-brokered peace. The intervention followed many claims by French nationals of losses due to unrest in Mexico. This would be the first of two French invasions of Mexico; a second, larger intervention would take place in the 1860s.

== Background ==
During the early years of the new Mexican republic there was widespread civil disorder as factions competed for control of the country. The fighting often resulted in the destruction or looting of private property. Average citizens had few options for claiming compensation as they had no representatives to speak on their behalf. Foreigners whose property was damaged or destroyed by rioters or bandits were usually also unable to obtain compensation from the Mexican government and they began to appeal to their own governments for help and compensation.

Commercial relationships between France and Mexico existed prior to Spain&#x27;s recognition of Mexico&#x27;s independence in 1830, and after the establishment of diplomatic relationships France rapidly became Mexico&#x27;s third largest trade partner. However, French goods were subject to higher taxes as France had yet to secure trade agreements similar to those which had been established by the United States and United Kingdom, Mexico&#x27;s two largest trade partners.

==Chronology==
In a complaint to King Louis-Philippe, a French pastry chef known only as Monsieur Remontel claimed that in 1832 Mexican officers looted his shop in Tacubaya (then a town on the outskirts of Mexico City). However, Mexican sources claim that the officers, from Santa Anna&#x27;s government, simply refused to pay their bills. Remontel demanded 60,000 pesos as reparations for the damage (his shop was valued at less than 1,000 pesos).

In view of Remontel&#x27;s complaint (which gave its name to the ensuing conflict) and of other complaints from French nationals (among them the looting in 1828 of French shops at the Parian market and the execution in 1837 of a French citizen accused of piracy), in 1838 prime minister Louis-Mathieu Molé demanded from Mexico the payment of 600,000 pesos (3 million Francs) in damages, an enormous sum for the time, when the typical daily wage in Mexico City was about one peso (8 Mexican reals).


When President Anastasio Bustamante made no payment, the French king ordered a fleet under Rear Admiral Charles Baudin to declare and carry out a blockade of all Mexican ports on the Gulf of Mexico from Yucatán to the Rio Grande, to bombard the Mexican fortress of San Juan de Ulúa, and to seize the city of Veracruz, which was the most important port on the Gulf coast. French forces captured Veracruz by December 1838 and Mexico declared war on France.

With trade cut off, the Mexicans began smuggling imports in Mexico via Corpus Christi (then part of the Republic of Texas). Fearing that France would blockade the Republic&#x27;s ports as well, a battalion of Texan forces began patrolling Corpus Christi Bay to stop Mexican smugglers. One smuggling party abandoned their cargo of about a hundred barrels of flour on the beach at the mouth of the bay, thus giving Flour Bluff its name. The United States soon sent the schooner &quot;Woodbury&quot; to help the French in their blockade. 

Meanwhile, acting without explicit government authority, Antonio López de Santa Anna, known for his military leadership, came out of retirement from his hacienda named &quot;Manga de Clavo&quot; near Xalapa and surveyed the defenses of Veracruz. He offered his services to the government, which ordered him to fight the French by any means necessary. He led Mexican forces against the French and fought at the Battle of Veracruz in 1838. In a skirmish with the rear guard of the French, Santa Anna was wounded in the leg by French grapeshot. His leg was amputated and buried with full military honors. Exploiting his wounds with eloquent propaganda, Santa Anna catapulted back to power.

==Peace restored==
The French forces withdrew on 9 March 1839 after a peace treaty was signed. As part of said treaty the Mexican government agreed to pay 600,000 pesos as damages to French citizens while France received promises for future trade commitments in place of war indemnities. However, this amount was never paid and that was later used as one of the justifications for the second French intervention in Mexico of 1861.

Following the Mexican victory in 1867 and the collapse of the Second French Empire in 1870, Mexico and France would not resume diplomatic relationships until 1880 when both countries renounced claims related to the wars.

<text>Joseph Fernand Henri Léger (; February 4, 1881 – August 17, 1955) was a French painter, sculptor, and filmmaker. In his early works he created a personal form of cubism (known as &quot;tubism&quot;) which he gradually modified into a more figurative, populist style. His boldly simplified treatment of modern subject matter has caused him to be regarded as a forerunner of pop art.

==Biography==
Léger was born in Argentan, Orne, Lower Normandy, where his father raised cattle. Fernand Léger initially trained as an architect from 1897 to 1899, before moving in 1900 to Paris, where he supported himself as an architectural draftsman. After military service in Versailles, Yvelines, in 1902–1903, he enrolled at the School of Decorative Arts after his application to the École des Beaux-Arts was rejected. He nevertheless attended the Beaux-Arts as a non-enrolled student, spending what he described as &quot;three empty and useless years&quot; studying with Gérôme and others, while also studying at the Académie Julian. He began to work seriously as a painter only at the age of 25. At this point his work showed the influence of impressionism, as seen in &quot;Le Jardin de ma mère&quot; (My Mother&#x27;s Garden) of 1905, one of the few paintings from this period that he did not later destroy. A new emphasis on drawing and geometry appeared in Léger&#x27;s work after he saw the Cézanne retrospective at the Salon d&#x27;Automne in 1907.

===1909–1914===

In 1909, he moved to Montparnasse and met Alexander Archipenko, Jacques Lipchitz, Marc Chagall, Joseph Csaky and Robert Delaunay.

In 1910, he exhibited at the Salon d&#x27;Automne in the same room (salle VIII) as Jean Metzinger and Henri Le Fauconnier. In his major painting of this period, &quot;Nudes in the Forest&quot;, Léger displays a personal form of Cubism that his critics termed &quot;Tubism&quot; for its emphasis on cylindrical forms.

In 1911, the hanging committee of the Salon des Indépendants placed together the painters identified as &#x27;Cubists&#x27;. Metzinger, Albert Gleizes, Le Fauconnier, Delaunay and Léger were responsible for revealing Cubism to the general public for the first time as an organized group.

The following year he again exhibited at the Salon d&#x27;Automne and Indépendants with the Cubists, and joined with several artists, including Le Fauconnier, Metzinger, Gleizes, Francis Picabia and the Duchamp brothers, Jacques Villon, Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Marcel Duchamp to form the Puteaux Group—also called the &quot;Section d&#x27;Or&quot; (The Golden Section).

Léger&#x27;s paintings, from then until 1914, became increasingly abstract. Their tubular, conical, and cubed forms are laconically rendered in rough patches of primary colors plus green, black and white, as seen in the series of paintings with the title &quot;Contrasting Forms&quot;. Léger made no use of the collage technique pioneered by Braque and Picasso.

===1914–1920===

Léger&#x27;s experiences in World War I had a significant effect on his work. Mobilized in August 1914 for service in the French Army, he spent two years at the front in Argonne. He produced many sketches of artillery pieces, airplanes, and fellow soldiers while in the trenches, and painted &quot;Soldier with a Pipe&quot; (1916) while on furlough. In September 1916, he almost died after a mustard gas attack by the German troops at Verdun. During a period of convalescence in Villepinte he painted &quot;The Card Players&quot; (1917), a canvas whose robot-like, monstrous figures reflect his experience of the war. As he explained:

...I was stunned by the sight of the breech of a 75 millimeter in the sunlight. It was the magic of light on the white metal. That&#x27;s all it took for me to forget the abstract art of 1912–1913. The crudeness, variety, humor, and downright perfection of certain men around me, their precise sense of utilitarian reality and its application in the midst of the life-and-death drama we were in ... made me want to paint in slang with all its color and mobility.

This work marked the beginning of his &quot;mechanical period&quot;, during which the figures and objects he painted were characterized by sleekly rendered tubular and machine-like forms. Starting in 1918, he also produced the first paintings in the &quot;Disk&quot; series, in which disks suggestive of traffic lights figure prominently. In December 1919 he married Jeanne-Augustine Lohy, and in 1920 he met Le Corbusier, who would remain a lifelong friend.

===1920s===
The &quot;mechanical&quot; works Léger painted in the 1920s, in their formal clarity as well as in their subject matter—the mother and child, the female nude, figures in an ordered landscape—are typical of the postwar &quot;return to order&quot; in the arts, and link him to the tradition of French figurative painting represented by Poussin and Corot. In his &quot;paysages animés&quot; (animated landscapes) of 1921, figures and animals exist harmoniously in landscapes made up of streamlined forms. The frontal compositions, firm contours, and smoothly blended colors of these paintings frequently recall the works of Henri Rousseau, an artist Léger greatly admired and whom he had met in 1909.

They also share traits with the work of Le Corbusier and Amédée Ozenfant who together had founded Purism, a style intended as a rational, mathematically based corrective to the impulsiveness of cubism. Combining the classical with the modern, Léger&#x27;s &quot;Nude on a Red Background&quot; (1927) depicts a monumental, expressionless woman, machinelike in form and color. His still life compositions from this period are dominated by stable, interlocking rectangular formations in vertical and horizontal orientation. &quot;The Siphon&quot; of 1924, a still life based on an advertisement in the popular press for the aperitif Campari, represents the high-water mark of the Purist aesthetic in Léger&#x27;s work. Its balanced composition and fluted shapes suggestive of classical columns are brought together with a quasi-cinematic close-up of a hand holding a bottle.
As an enthusiast of the modern, Léger was greatly attracted to cinema, and for a time he considered giving up painting for filmmaking. In 1923–24 he designed the set for the laboratory scene in Marcel L&#x27;Herbier&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Inhumaine&quot; (The Inhuman One). In 1924, in collaboration with and George Antheil and Man Ray, Léger and the filmmaker Dudley Murphy co-produced and co-directed the iconic and Futurism-influenced film &quot;Ballet Mécanique&quot; (Mechanical Ballet). Neither abstract nor narrative, it is a series of images of a woman&#x27;s lips and teeth, close-up shots of ordinary objects, and repeated images of human activities and machines in rhythmic movement.

In collaboration with Amédée Ozenfant he established the Académie Moderne, a free school where he taught from 1924, with Alexandra Exter and Marie Laurencin. He produced the first of his &quot;mural paintings&quot;, influenced by Le Corbusier&#x27;s theories, in 1925. Intended to be incorporated into polychrome architecture, they are among his most abstract paintings, featuring flat areas of color that appear to advance or recede.

===1930s===
Starting in 1927, the character of Léger&#x27;s work gradually changed as organic and irregular forms assumed greater importance. The figural style that emerged in the 1930s is fully displayed in the &quot;Two Sisters&quot; of 1935, and in several versions of &quot;Adam and Eve&quot;. With characteristic humor, he portrayed Adam in a striped bathing suit, or sporting a tattoo.

In 1931, Léger made his first visit to the United States, where he traveled to New York City and Chicago. In 1935, the Museum of Modern Art in New York presented an exhibition of his work. In 1938, Léger was commissioned to decorate Nelson Rockefeller&#x27;s apartment.

===1940s===

During World War II Léger lived in the United States. He taught at Yale University, and found inspiration for a new series of paintings in the novel sight of industrial refuse in the landscape. The shock of juxtaposed natural forms and mechanical elements, the &quot;tons of abandoned machines with flowers cropping up from within, and birds perching on top of them&quot; exemplified what he called the &quot;law of contrast&quot;. His enthusiasm for such contrasts resulted in such works as &quot;The Tree in the Ladder&quot; of 1943–44, and &quot;Romantic Landscape&quot; of 1946. Reprising a composition of 1930, he painted &quot;Three Musicians&quot; (Museum of Modern Art, New York) in 1944. Reminiscent of Rousseau in its folk-like character, the painting exploits the law of contrasts in its juxtaposition of the three men and their instruments.

During his American sojourn, Léger began making paintings in which freely arranged bands of color are juxtaposed with figures and objects outlined in black. Léger credited the neon lights of New York City as the source of this innovation: &quot;I was struck by the neon advertisements flashing all over Broadway. You are there, you talk to someone, and all of a sudden he turns blue. Then the color fades—another one comes and turns him red or yellow.&quot;

Upon his return to France in 1945, he joined the Communist Party. During this period his work became less abstract, and he produced many monumental figure compositions depicting scenes of popular life featuring acrobats, builders, divers, and country outings. Art historian Charlotta Kotik has written that Léger&#x27;s &quot;determination to depict the common man, as well as to create for him, was a result of socialist theories widespread among the avant-garde both before and after World War II. However, Léger&#x27;s social conscience was not that of a fierce Marxist, but of a passionate humanist&quot;. His varied projects included book illustrations, murals, stained-glass windows, mosaics, polychrome ceramic sculptures, and set and costume designs.

===1950s===
After the death of Leger&#x27;s wife Jeanne-Augustine Lohy in 1950, Léger married Nadia Khodossevitch in 1952. In his final years he lectured in Bern, designed mosaics and stained-glass windows for the Central University of Venezuela in Caracas, Venezuela, and painted &quot;Country Outing&quot;, &quot;The Camper&quot;, and the series &quot;The Big Parade&quot;. In 1954 he began a project for a mosaic for the São Paulo Opera, which he would not live to finish. Fernand Léger died suddenly at his home in 1955 and is buried in Gif-sur-Yvette, Essonne.

==Legacy==
Léger wrote in 1945 that &quot;the &quot;object&quot; in modern painting must become the &quot;main character&quot; and overthrow the subject. If, in turn, the human form becomes an object, it can considerably liberate possibilities for the modern artist.&quot; He elaborated on this idea in his 1949 essay, &quot;How I Conceive the Human Figure&quot;, where he wrote that &quot;abstract art came as a complete revelation, and then we were able to consider the human figure as a plastic value, not as a sentimental value. That is why the human figure has remained willfully inexpressive throughout the evolution of my work&quot;. As the first painter to take as his idiom the imagery of the machine age, and to make the objects of consumer society the subjects of his paintings, Léger has been called a progenitor of Pop Art.

He was active as a teacher for many years, first at the Académie Vassilieff in Paris, then in 1931 at the Sorbonne, and then developing his own &quot;Académie Fernand Léger&quot;, which was in Paris, then at the Yale School of Art and Architecture (1938–1939), Mills College Art Gallery in Oakland, California during 1940–1945, before he returned to France. Among his many international pupils were Nadir Afonso, Paul Georges, Charlotte Gilbertson, Hananiah Harari, Asger Jorn, Michael Loew, Beverly Pepper, Victor Reinganum, Marcel Mouly, René Margotton, Saloua Raouda Choucair and Charlotte Wankel, Peter Agostini, Lou Albert-Lasard, Tarsila do Amaral, Arie Aroch, Alma del Banco, Christian Berg, Louise Bourgeois, Marcelle Cahn, Norman Carton, Otto Gustaf Carlsund, Saloua Raouda Choucair, Robert Colescott, Lars Englund, Tsuguharu Foujita, Sam Francis, Serge Gainsbourg, Hans Hartung, Florence Henri, William Klein, Maryan, George Lovett Kingsland Morris, Marlow Moss, Aurélie Nemours, Gerhard Neumann, Jules Olitski, Erik Olson, Richard Stankiewicz, Theo Stavropoulos and Stasys Usinskas.

In 1952, a pair of Léger murals was installed in the General Assembly Hall of the United Nations headquarters in New York City.

In 1960, the Fernand Léger Museum was opened in Biot, Alpes-Maritimes, France.

Léger bequeathed his residence (at 108 Avenue du General Leclerc, Gif sur Yvette, Paris) to the French Communist Party, which later hosted negotiations of the Paris Peace Accords between the United States, Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Republic of Vietnam and the Republic of South Vietnam

In May 2008, his painting &quot;Étude pour la femme en bleu&quot; (1912–13) sold for $39,241,000 (hammer price with buyer&#x27;s premium) United States dollars.

In August 2008, one of Léger&#x27;s paintings owned by Wellesley College&#x27;s Davis Museum and Cultural Center, &quot;Mother and Child&quot;, was reported missing. It is believed to have disappeared some time between April 9, 2007, and November 19, 2007. A $100,000 reward is being offered for information that leads to the safe return of the painting.

Léger&#x27;s work was featured in the exhibition &quot;Léger: Modern Art and the Metropolis&quot; from October 14, 2013, through January 5, 2014, at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

In 2022, it was announced that a lost painting of the rooftop series was discovered on the opposite side of the painting &quot;Bastille Day&quot;.

<text>William Thomas Cosgrave (5 June 1880 – 16 November 1965) was an Irish politician who served as the President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State from 1922 to 1932, Leader of the Opposition from 1932 to 1944, Leader of Fine Gael from 1934 to 1944, founder and leader of Cumann na nGaedheal, from 1923 to 1933, Chairman of the Provisional Government from August 1922 to December 1922, the President of Dáil Éireann from September 1922 to December 1922, the Minister for Finance from 1922 to 1923 and Minister for Local Government from 1919 to 1922. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1921 to 1944. He was also a Member of parliament (MP) for the Kilkenny North constituency from 1918 to 1922.

His son, Liam, served as Taoiseach from 1973 to 1977.

==Early and private life==
William Thomas Cosgrave was born at 174 James&#x27;s Street, Dublin in 1880, to Thomas Cosgrave, grocer, and Bridget (Nixon) Cosgrave. He was educated at the Christian Brothers School at Malahide Road, Marino, before entering his father&#x27;s publican business. Cosgrave first became politically active when he attended the first Sinn Féin convention in 1905.

He was a Sinn Féin councillor on Dublin Corporation from 1909 until 1922 and joined the Irish Volunteers in 1913, although he never joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood because he didn&#x27;t believe in secret societies.

He played an active role in the Easter Rising of 1916, serving under Éamonn Ceannt as a Captain at the South Dublin Union. Following the rebellion, Cosgrave was sentenced to death, but that was later commuted to penal servitude for life and he was interned at Frongoch internment camp, Wales. While imprisoned, he won a seat for Sinn Féin in the Kilkenny City by-election of August 1917. After his victory, he made a speech on the courthouse balcony. In September 1917, he and Michael Collins addressed a crowd in Dunboyne, County Meath, urging people to join the Irish Volunteers.

Cosgrave again won an Irish seat at the 1918 general election, this time for Kilkenny North. Although he and many other Sinn Féin MPs were still in prison at the time, 27 free Sinn Féin MPs, in accordance with their party&#x27;s manifesto, refused to go to Westminster and instead formed the First Dáil, in which Cosgrave took his seat after he was released from prison in 1919. On 24 June 1919, he married Louisa Flanagan (28 August 1882 – 1959) in Dublin, daughter of Alderman Michael Flanagan, a nationalist councillor on Dublin Corporation between 1884 and 1919. During his later years, Cosgrave was cared for by his son and daughter-in-law, Liam and Vera.

==Political career==
===Minister for local government===
Although Cosgrave was one of the most politically experienced of Sinn Féin&#x27;s TDs, Cosgrave was not within the leadership of the party. However, when Éamon de Valera formed the Second Ministry of Dáil Éireann on 2 April 1919, Cosgrave was named as Secretary of Local Government. His close friendship with de Valera and his long experience on Dublin Corporation, most recently as chairman of its finance committee, were among the reasons he was selected. His chief task as Minister was the job of organising the non-cooperation of the people with the British authorities and establishing an alternative system of government.

After the 1920 local elections, elected under the new system of single transferable vote, 28 of the 33 local councils pledged loyalty to the Ministry of Local Government established by the Dáil. These councils then cut their links to the British government.

===Anglo-Irish Treaty===
Cosgrave supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty, which had been signed on 6 December 1921. At the cabinet meeting in Dublin held to consider the Treaty immediately after it had been signed, Cosgrave surprised de Valera by agreeing with Collins and with Arthur Griffith, de Valera&#x27;s predecessor as leader of Sinn Féin and the chairman of the delegation which included Collins that had negotiated the Treaty. It was narrowly supported by the cabinet in a vote of 4 to 3, and was supported by the Dáil in a vote of 64 to 57. However, de Valera voted against and resigned as president in January 1922 (which in August 1921 had been upgraded from a prime ministerial President of Dáil Éireann to a full head of state, called President of the Irish Republic). Griffith succeeded de Valera as president. Collins, following the Treaty, formed a Provisional Government; this included Cosgrave amongst its membership as Minister for Local Government. From July onward, he also became Minister for Finance.

===Chairman of the Provisional Government===
The months following the acceptance of the Treaty saw a gradual progression to civil war. The split in Sinn Féin gradually deepened, and hardened against accepting anything less than a full republic. Collins and de Valera tried desperately to find a middle course and formed a pact whereby Sinn Féin fought a general election in June with a common slate of candidates. Despite this pact, the electorate voted heavily in favour of pro-Treaty candidates. On the day of the election, the draft Constitution of the Irish Free State was published; it was rejected by the Anti-Treatyites, for it was not a republican document. Collins, forced to a decision, opted to maintain the Treaty position and the support of the British government, and moved to suppress the Republican opposition that had seized the Four Courts in Dublin. The Civil War began on 28 June 1922, and the IRA was decisively defeated in the field over the following two months, being largely pinned back to Munster. In August 1922, both Griffith and Collins died in quick succession; the former of natural causes, the latter a few days later when ambushed by Republicans at Béal na Bláth, County Cork. With de Valera now on the fringes as the nominal leader of the anti-Treaty forces in the Civil War, the new dominion (which was in the process of being created but which would not legally come into being until December 1922) had lost all its most senior figures.

Though it had the option of going for General Richard Mulcahy, Collins&#x27; successor as Commander-in-Chief of the National Army, the pro-Treaty leadership opted for Cosgrave, in part due to his democratic credentials as a long-time politician. Having previously held the Local Government and Finance portfolios, Cosgrave became Chairman of the Provisional Government on 30 August and President of Dáil Éirean on 9 September. He served in both offices simultaneously until 6 December 1922, when the Irish Free State came into being.

==President of the Executive Council (1922–1932)==
On 6 December 1922, Cosgrave was elected by the Dáil as president of the executive council. He formed the First Executive Council of the Irish Free State. Cosgrave was a small, quiet man, and at 42 was the oldest member of the Cabinet. He had not sought the leadership of the new country, but once it was his he made good use of it. One of his chief priorities was to hold the new country together and to prove that the Irish could govern themselves. 

===Domestic policy===
As head of the Free State government during the Civil War, he was ruthless in what he saw as the defence of the state against his Republican former comrades. Although he disagreed with the use of the death penalty in principle, in October 1922, he enacted a Public Safety Bill, after difficult debates, and following the offer of an amnesty, that allowed for the execution of anyone who was captured bearing arms against the state, or aiding armed attacks on state forces. He told the Dáil on 27 September 1922: &quot;Although I have always objected to the death penalty, there is no other way that I know of in which ordered conditions can be restored in this country, or any security obtained for our troops, or to give our troops any confidence in us as a government&quot;. His view was that if harsh action were not taken, a guerrilla war could drag on indefinitely, making the achievement of law and order and establishing the Free State impossible.

His army ordered courts martial on the rebels, 77 of whom were executed by firing squads by May 1923, including Erskine Childers, Liam Mellowes and Rory O&#x27;Connor, far more than the 14 IRA volunteers the British executed in the War of Independence. The Republican side, for their part, attacked pro-Treaty politicians and their homes and families. Cosgrave&#x27;s family home was burned down by anti-Treaty fighters, and one of his uncles was shot dead. (see also Destruction of country houses in the Irish revolutionary period and Executions during the Irish Civil War).

Cosgrave said &quot;I am not going to hesitate if the country is to live, and if we have to exterminate ten thousand Republicans, the three million of our people is greater than this ten thousand&quot;.

In April 1923, the pro-Treaty Sinn Féin members organised a new political party called Cumann na nGaedheal with Cosgrave as leader. The following month the Civil War was brought to an end when the remaining anti-Treaty IRA guerrillas announced a ceasefire and dumped their arms.
One of his first acts in government was to pass a Bill for the Constitution of the Irish Free State, which some TDs felt did not need to be in writing. This was done by October 1922, ahead of the establishment of the Irish Free State in December.

In the first few years in office, Cosgrave&#x27;s government faced several problems. The government attempted to reduce the size of the National Army. During the Civil War, it had grown to over 55,000 men which, now that the war was over, was far too large and costly to maintain. Some army officers challenged the authority of the government to cut the size of the Army. The officers, mostly Pro-Treaty IRA men, were angry that the government was not doing enough to help create a republic and predicted massive unemployment. 

When he and his position were challenged by the disgruntled Army officers of the Irish Republican Army Organisation, other politicians and soldiers took the important decisions.

In March 1924, more layoffs were expected, and army officers Major-General Liam Tobin and Colonel Charles Dalton sent an ultimatum to the government demanding an end to the demobilisation. Minister for Justice Kevin O&#x27;Higgins, who was also acting president for Cosgrave while the latter was in hospital, moved to resolve the so-called &quot;Army Mutiny&quot;. Richard Mulcahy, the Minister for Defence, resigned, and O&#x27;Higgins was victorious in a very public power struggle within Cumann na nGaedheal. The crisis within the army was solved but the government was divided.

In 1924, the British and Irish governments agreed to attend a Boundary Commission to redraw the border which partitioned Ireland between the Irish Free State and Northern Ireland. The Free State&#x27;s representative was Minister for Education Eoin MacNeill, a respected scholar. The Free State expected to gain much territory in heavily Catholic and republican parts of Counties Londonderry, Fermanagh, Tyrone, and Armagh, for the British government had indicated during the Treaty negotiations that the wishes of the nationalist inhabitants along the border would be taken into account. However, after months of secret negotiations, a newspaper reported that there would be little change to the border, and the Free State would lose territory in County Donegal. MacNeill resigned from the Commission and, shortly afterwards, from the government for not reporting to Cosgrave on the details of the commission. Cosgrave immediately went to London for a meeting with the British Prime Minister and the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland, where they agreed to let the border remain as it was, and in return, the Free State did not have to pay its pro-rata share of the Imperial debt. In the Dáil debate on 7 December, Cosgrave stated: &quot;I had only one figure in my mind and that was a huge nought. That was the figure I strove to get, and I got it.&quot;

Cosgrave turned down a plea for asylum in Ireland for Leon Trotsky while in exile. The request was made by the trade union leader William O&#x27;Brien in 1930. Cosgrave recorded that he: 

In June 1927, a general election was held in which de Valera&#x27;s new party, Fianna Fáil, won many seats on an abstentionist platform. In July the Minister for Justice, Kevin O&#x27;Higgins, was assassinated on his way home from Sunday Mass by the IRA. The government passed the Electoral Amendment Bill (1927) to force Fianna Fáil to take their seats in the Dáil. This proved successful with de Valera and his party entering the Dáil in August of that year. Previously, without de Valera, Cosgrave faced very little opposition, giving him considerable freedom of action. However, de Valera&#x27;s arrival significantly altered the situation. 

===Foreign policy===
Although Cosgrave and his government accepted dominion status for the Irish Free State, they did not trust the British to respect this new independence. The government embarked on fairly radical foreign initiatives. In 1923 the Irish Free State became a member of the League of Nations. The new state also became the first British Commonwealth country to have a separate or non-British representative in Washington, D.C., and exchanged diplomats with many other European nations. In January 1926, Cosgrave was honoured by Pope Pius XI by making him the first Irishman to receive the rank of Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Pope Pius IX.

The Anglo-Irish Treaty itself also gave the Irish much more independence than many other dominions. The Oath of Allegiance in the Irish Free State was much less monarchist than its equivalent in Canada or Australia. The king&#x27;s representative in Ireland was Irish, unlike the other dominions, and although the head of state was the king, power was derived from the Irish people and not him. There were also questions raised about the word &quot;treaty&quot;. The British claimed it was an internal affair while the Irish saw it as an international agreement between two independent states, a point which was accepted by the League of Nations when that body registered the Treaty as an international agreement in 1924.

Even with these advances, the Irish Free State legally remained subject to the United Kingdom until 1931, when the Statute of Westminster gave the Free State and the other dominions the right to the full independence of legislative and constitutional action. This step effectively made the Free State the internationally recognised independent, although still partitioned, Irish state, arguably fulfilling Collins&#x27; vision of the Treaty giving the Irish people &quot;the freedom to achieve freedom.&quot;

===Economic policy===

During the ten years that Cosgrave and Cumann na nGaedheal were in power, they adopted a conservative economic policy. Taxation was kept as low as possible and the budget was balanced to avoid borrowing. The Irish currency remained linked to the British currency, resulting in the overvaluation of the Irish pound. Free trade was advocated as opposed to protection, but moderate tariffs were introduced on some items.

The new government decided to concentrate on developing agriculture while doing little to help the industrial sector. Agriculture responded well with stricter quality control being introduced and the passing of a Land Act to help farmers buy their farms. Also, the Irish Sugar Company and the Agricultural Credit Corporation were established to encourage growth. However, the economic depression that hit in the 1930s soon undid the good work of Cosgrave and his ministers. Industry was seen as secondary to agriculture and little was done to improve it. The loss of the industrialised north-east of Ireland had a bad effect on the country as a whole. However, the Electricity Supply Board, with the first national grid in Europe, was established to provide employment and electricity to the new state.

===General election 1932===

A general election was not required by law until the end of 1932. However, Cosgrave called one for February of that year. There was growing unrest in the country and a fresh mandate was needed for an important Commonwealth meeting in the summer. Another reason for calling the election early was the Eucharistic Congress to be held in June, a major national and international event.

Cosgrave, like most of his cabinet a devout Catholic, had invested much time in the build-up to it and wished it to proceed without any tension from a pending general election. In the event, Éamon de Valera and Fianna Fáil were the ones to derive all the kudos from that event. Cumann na nGaedheal fought the election on its record of providing ten years of honest government and political and economic stability. Instead of developing new policies, the party played the &quot;red card&quot; by portraying the new party, Fianna Fáil, as communists. Fianna Fáil offered the electorate a fresh and popular manifesto of social reform. Unable to compete with this, Cosgrave and his party lost the election, and a minority Fianna Fáil government came to power.

==Cosgrave in opposition==
Following the general election of that year, Cosgrave assumed the role of Leader of the Opposition, as Fianna Fáil began what turned out to be sixteen years of single-party government. In 1933, three groups, Cumann na nGaedheal, the National Centre Party and the National Guard came together to form a new party, called Fine Gael. Cosgrave was named the merged party&#x27;s deputy leader, with Eoin O&#x27;Duffy as party leader. However, since O&#x27;Duffy didn&#x27;t have a seat in the Dáil, Cosgrave became Fine Gael&#x27;s parliamentary leader and thus remained Leader of the Opposition. He became party leader the following year when O&#x27;Duffy stepped down. Under his leadership, Fine Gael lost elections in 1937, 1938 and 1943. Cosgrave retired as leader of the party at the Fine Gael Ard Fheis in the Mansion House, Dublin, on 26 January 1944, and was succeeded by Richard Mulcahy.

==Legacy==
An effective and good chairman rather than a colourful or charismatic leader, he led the new state during the more turbulent period of its history, when the legislation necessary for the foundation of a stable independent Irish polity needed to be pushed through. Cosgrave&#x27;s governments in particular played a crucial role in the evolution of the British Empire into the British Commonwealth, with fundamental changes to the concept of the role of the Crown, the governor-generalship and the British Government within the Commonwealth.

In overseeing the establishment of the formal institutions of the state, his performance as its first political leader may have been undervalued. In an era when democratic governments formed in the aftermath of the First World War were moving away from democracy and towards dictatorships, the Free State, under Cosgrave, remained unambiguously democratic, a fact shown by his handing over of power to his one-time friend, then rival, Éamon de Valera, when de Valera&#x27;s Fianna Fáil won the 1932 general election, in the process killing off talk within the Irish Army of staging a coup to keep Cosgrave in power and de Valera out of government.

Perhaps the best endorsement made of Cosgrave came from his old rival Éamon de Valera, with whom he was reconciled before his death. To his son, Vivion, weeks after taking power in 1932 and reading the files on the actions of Cosgrave&#x27;s governments concerning its work in the Commonwealth, he said of Cosgrave and Cosgrave&#x27;s ministers, &quot;[W]hen we got in and saw the files … they did a magnificent job, Viv. They did a magnificent job.&quot;

==Death==

Cosgrave died on 16 November 1965, aged 85. The Fianna Fáil government under Seán Lemass awarded him the honour of a state funeral, which was attended by the cabinet, the leaders of all the main Irish political parties, and Éamon de Valera, then President of Ireland. He is buried in Goldenbridge Cemetery in Inchicore in Dublin. Richard Mulcahy said, &quot;It is in terms of the Nation and its needs and its potential that I praise God who gave us in our dangerous days the gentle but steel-like spirit of rectitude, courage and humble self-sacrifice, that was William T. Cosgrave&quot;.

Cosgrave&#x27;s son, Liam, served as a TD from 1943 to 1981 and served as leader of Fine Gael from 1965 to 1977 and Taoiseach from 1973 to 1977. W. T.&#x27;s grandson, also called Liam, also served as a TD and as Senator and his granddaughter, Louise Cosgrave, served as on Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council from 1999 to 2009.

In October 2014, his grave was vandalised, the top of a Celtic cross on the headstone being broken off. It was again vandalised in March 2016.

==Governments==
The following governments were led by Cosgrave:
* 1st provisional government (22–30 August 1922)
* 2nd provisional government (August 1922 – December 1922)
* 1st executive council of the Irish Free State (December 1922 – September 1923)

<text>Anna Pavlovna Pavlova (born Anna Matveyevna Pavlova; – 23 January 1931) was a Russian prima ballerina. She was a principal artist of the Imperial Russian Ballet and the Ballets Russes of Sergei Diaghilev, but is most recognized for creating the role of &quot;The Dying Swan&quot; and, with her own company, being the first ballerina to tour the world, including South America, India, Mexico and Australia.

==Early life==
Anna Matveyevna Pavlova was born in the Preobrazhensky Regiment hospital, Saint Petersburg where her father, Matvey Pavlovich Pavlov, served. Some sources say that her parents married just before her birth, others—years later. Her mother, Lyubov Feodorovna Pavlova, came from peasants and worked as a laundress at the house of a Russian-Jewish banker, Lazar Polyakov, for some time. When Anna rose to fame, Polyakov&#x27;s son Vladimir claimed that she was an illegitimate daughter of his father; others speculated Matvey came from Crimean Karaites (there is a monument in one of Yevpatoria&#x27;s kenesas dedicated to Pavlova), yet both legends find no historical proof. Anna Matveyevna changed her patronymic to Pavlovna when she started performing on stage.

Pavlova was a premature child, regularly felt ill and was soon sent to the Ligovo village where her grandmother looked after her. Pavlova&#x27;s passion for the art of ballet took off when her mother took her to a performance of Marius Petipa&#x27;s original production of &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; at the Imperial Maryinsky Theater in 1890. The lavish spectacle made an impression on Pavlova. When she was nine, her mother took her to audition for the Imperial Ballet School. Because of her youth and sickly appearance, she was rejected, but, at age 10, in 1891, she was accepted. She appeared for the first time on stage in Petipa&#x27;s &quot;Un conte de fées&quot; (&quot;A Fairy Tale&quot;), which the ballet master staged for the students of the school.

==Imperial Ballet School==
Young Pavlova&#x27;s years of classical ballet training were difficult. Her severely arched feet, thin ankles and long limbs clashed with the small, compact body favoured for the ballerina of the time. Her fellow students taunted her with such nicknames as &quot;The broom&quot; and &quot;La petite sauvage&quot;. Undeterred, she trained to improve her technique. She practiced repeatedly after learning a step. She said: &quot;No one can arrive from being talented alone. God gives talent, work transforms talent into genius.&quot; She took extra lessons from the noted teachers of the day—Christian Johansson, Pavel Gerdt, Nikolai Legat—and from Enrico Cecchetti, considered the greatest ballet virtuoso of the time and founder of the Cecchetti method, a very influential ballet technique used to this day. In 1898, she entered the &quot;classe de perfection&quot; of Ekaterina Vazem, former &quot;Prima ballerina&quot; of the Saint Petersburg Imperial Theatres.

During her final year at the Imperial Ballet School, Pavlova performed many roles with the principal company. She graduated in 1899 at age 18, chosen to enter the Imperial Ballet a rank ahead of &quot;corps de ballet&quot; as a &quot;coryphée&quot;. She made her official début at the Mariinsky Theatre in Pavel Gerdt&#x27;s &quot;Les Dryades prétendues&quot; (&quot;The False Dryads&quot;). Her performance drew praise from the critics, particularly Nikolai Bezobrazov.

==Career==
===St. Petersburg===
====Marius Petipa====
At the height of Petipa&#x27;s strict academicism, the public was taken aback by Pavlova&#x27;s style, a combination of a gift that paid little heed to academic rules: she frequently performed with bent knees, bad turnout, misplaced &quot;port de bras&quot; and incorrectly placed &quot;tours&quot;. Such a style, in many ways, harkened back to the time of the romantic ballet and the great ballerinas of old.

Pavlova performed in various classical variations, &quot;pas de deux&quot; and &quot;pas de trois&quot; in such ballets as &quot;La Camargo&quot;, &quot;Le Roi Candaule&quot;, &quot;Marcobomba&quot; and &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;. Her enthusiasm often led her astray: once during a performance as the River Thames in Petipa&#x27;s &quot;The Pharaoh&#x27;s Daughter&quot; her energetic double &quot;pique turns&quot; led her to lose her balance and fall into the prompter&#x27;s box. Her weak ankles led to difficulty while performing as the fairy Candide in Petipa&#x27;s &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot;, leading the ballerina to revise the fairy&#x27;s jumps &quot;en pointe&quot;, much to the surprise of the Ballet Master. She tried desperately to imitate the renowned Pierina Legnani, &quot;Prima ballerina assoluta&quot; of the Imperial Theaters. Once, during class, she attempted Legnani&#x27;s famous fouettés, causing her teacher, Pavel Gerdt, to fly into a rage. He told her,
Pavlova rose through the ranks quickly, becoming a favorite of the old maestro Petipa. From him she learned the title role in &quot;Paquita&quot;, Princess Aspicia in &quot;The Pharaoh&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, Queen Nisia in &quot;Le Roi Candaule&quot; and &quot;Giselle&quot;. She was named &quot;danseuse&quot; in 1902, &quot;première danseuse&quot; in 1905 and &quot;prima ballerina&quot; in 1906 after a resounding performance in &quot;Giselle&quot;. Petipa revised many &quot;grand pas&quot; for her, as well as many supplemental variations. She was much celebrated by the fanatical balletomanes of Tsarist Saint Petersburg, her legions of fans calling themselves the &quot;Pavlovatzi&quot;.

When the ballerina Mathilde Kschessinska was pregnant in 1901, she coached Pavlova in the role of Nikiya in &quot;La Bayadère&quot;. Kschessinska, not wanting to be upstaged, was certain Pavlova would fail in the role, as she was considered technically inferior because of her small ankles and lithe legs. Instead, audiences became enchanted with Pavlova and her frail, ethereal look, which fit the role perfectly, particularly in the scene &quot;The Kingdom of the Shades&quot;.

====Michel Fokine====

Pavlova is perhaps most renowned for creating the role of &quot;The Dying Swan&quot;, a solo choreographed for her by Michel Fokine. The ballet, created in 1905, is danced to &quot;Le cygne&quot; from &quot;The Carnival of the Animals&quot; by Camille Saint-Saëns. She also choreographed several solos herself, one of which is &quot;The Dragonfly&quot;, a short ballet set to music by Fritz Kreisler. While performing it, she wore a gossamer gown with large dragonfly wings fixed to the back.

Pavlova had a rivalry with Tamara Karsavina. According to the film &quot;A Portrait of Giselle&quot;, Karsavina recalls a wardrobe malfunction during a performance; her shoulder straps fell, exposing her breasts and Pavlova helped embarrass her to tears.

===Ballets Russes===
In the first years of the Ballets Russes, Pavlova worked briefly for Sergei Diaghilev. Originally, she was to dance the lead in Mikhail Fokine&#x27;s &quot;The Firebird&quot;, but refused the part, as she could not come to terms with Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s avant-garde score, and the role was given to Tamara Karsavina. All her life, she preferred the melodious &quot;musique dansante&quot; of the old maestros such as Cesare Pugni and Ludwig Minkus, caring little for anything else which strayed from the salon-style ballet music of the 19th century.

===Pavlova&#x27;s ballet company===
====Touring the world====

After the first Paris season of Ballets Russes, Pavlova left it to form her own company. It performed throughout the world, with a repertory primarily of abridgements of Petipa&#x27;s works and pieces choreographed specially for her. Going independent was

&quot;a very enterprising and daring act. She toured on her own... for twenty years until her death. She traveled everywhere in the world that travel was possible, and introduced the ballet to millions who had never seen any form of Western dancing.&quot;

Pavlova also performed many &#x27;ethnic&#x27; dances, some of which she learned from local teachers during her travels. In addition to the dances of her native Russia, she performed Mexican, Japanese and East Indian dances. Supported by her interest, Uday Shankar, her dance partner in &quot;Krishna Radha&quot; (1923), went on to revive the long-neglected art of the dance in his native India. She also toured China. 
In 1916, she produced a 50-minute adaptation of &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; in New York City. Members of her company were largely English girls with Russianized names. In 1918–1919, her company toured throughout South America, during which time Pavlova exerted an influence on the young American ballerina Ruth Page.

In 1915, she appeared in the film &quot;The Dumb Girl of Portici&quot;, in which she played a mute girl betrayed by an aristocrat.

====England====
After leaving Russia, Pavlova moved to London, England, settling, in 1912, at the Ivy House on North End Road, Golders Green, north of Hampstead Heath, where she lived for the rest of her life. The house had an ornamental lake where she fed her pet swans, and where now stands a statue of her by the Scots sculptor George Henry Paulin. The house was featured in the film &quot;Anna Pavlova&quot;. It used to be the London Jewish Cultural Centre, but a blue plaque marks it as a site of significant historical interest being Pavlova&#x27;s home. While in London, Pavlova was influential in the development of British ballet, most notably inspiring the career of Alicia Markova. The Gate public house (https://thegatearkley.co.uk) located on the border of Arkley and Totteridge (London Borough of Barnet), has a story, framed on its walls, describing a visit by Pavlova and her dance company.

There are at least five memorials to Pavlova in London, England: a contemporary sculpture by Tom Merrifield of Pavlova as the Dragonfly in the grounds of Ivy House, a sculpture by Scot George Henry Paulin in the middle of the Ivy House pond, a blue plaque on the front of Ivy House, a statuette sitting with the urn that holds her ashes in Golders Green Crematorium and the gilded statue atop the Victoria Palace Theatre. When the Victoria Palace Theatre in London, England, opened in 1911, a gilded statue of Pavlova had been installed above the cupola of the theatre. This was taken down for its safety during World War II and was lost. In 2006, a replica of the original statue was restored in its place.

In 1928, Anna Pavlova engaged St. Petersburg conductor Efrem Kurtz to accompany her dancing, which he did until her death in 1931. During the last five years of her life, one of her soloists, Cleo Nordi, another St Petersburg ballerina, became her dedicated assistant, having left the Paris Opera Ballet in 1926 to join her company and accompanied her on her second Australian tour to Adelaide, Brisbane and Sydney in 1929. On the way back on board ship, Nordi married Pavlova&#x27;s British musical director, Walford Hyden. Nordi kept Pavlova&#x27;s flame burning in London, well into the 1970s, where she tutored hundreds of pupils including many ballet stars.

====The United States====
Between 1912 and 1926, Pavlova made almost annual tours of the United States, traveling from coast to coast.

&quot;A generation of dancers turned to the art because of her. She roused America as no one had done since Elssler. ... America became Pavlova-conscious and therefore ballet-conscious. Dance and passion, dance and drama were fused.&quot;

;Boston
Pavlova was introduced to audiences in the United States by Max Rabinoff during his time as managing director of the Boston Grand Opera Company from 1914 to 1917 and was featured there with her Russian Ballet Company during that period.

;St. Louis
In 1914, Pavlova performed in St. Louis, Missouri, after being engaged at the last minute by Hattie B. Gooding, responsible for a series of worthy musical attractions presented to the St. Louis public during the season of 1913–14! Gooding went to New York to arrange with the musical managers for the attractions offered. Out of a long list, she selected those who represent the highest in their own special field and which she felt sure St. Louisans would enjoy. The list began with Madame Louise Homer, prima donna contralto of the Metropolitan Grand Opera Co., followed by Josef Hofmann, pianist, Pavlova with the Russian ballet. For the last, the expenses were $5,500.00 ($ in dollars) for two nights, and the receipts $7,500.00 ($ in dollars), netting a clear gain of $2,000.00 ($ in dollars); her other evenings were proportionately successful financially. The advance sales were greater than any other city in the United States. At the Pavlova concert, when Gooding engaged, at the last hour, the Russian dancer for two nights, the New York managers became dubious and anxiously rushed four special advance agents to assist her. On seeing the bookings for both nights, they quietly slipped back to New York fully convinced of her ability to attract audiences in St. Louis, which had always, heretofore, been called &quot;the worst show town&quot; in the country.
==Personal life==

Victor Dandré, her manager and companion, said he was her husband in his biography of the dancer in 1932, &quot;Anna Pavlova: In Art and Life&quot;. They had secretly married in 1914 after first meeting in 1904 (some sources say 1900). He died on 5 February 1944 and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium and his ashes placed below those of Anna.

Dandré wrote of Pavlova&#x27;s many charity dance performances and charitable efforts to support Russian orphans in post-World War I Paris

Fifteen girls were adopted into a home Pavlova purchased near Paris at Saint-Cloud, overseen by the Comtesse de Guerne and supported by her performances and funds solicited by Pavlova, including many small donations from members of the Camp Fire Girls of America, who made her an honorary member.

During her life, she had many pets, including a Siamese cat, various dogs and many birds, including swans. Dandré indicated she was a lifelong animal lover, corroborated by photographic portraits for which she sat, often with an animal she loved. A formal studio portrait was taken of her with Jack, her favorite swan.

==Death==

While travelling from Paris to The Hague, Pavlova became very ill and more ill upon arrival. She sent to Paris for her personal physician, Zalewski, to attend her. She was told that she had pneumonia and required an operation. She was also told that she would never be able to dance again if she went ahead with it. She refused to have the surgery, saying, &quot;If I can&#x27;t dance, then I&#x27;d rather be dead.&quot; She died of pleurisy in the bedroom next to the Japanese Salon of the Hotel Des Indes in The Hague twenty days short of her 50th birthday.

Victor Dandré wrote that Pavlova died a half hour past midnight on Friday, 23 January 1931, with her maid Marguerite Létienne, Zalevsky and himself at her bedside. Her last words were, &quot;Get my &#x27;Swan&#x27; costume ready.&quot; Dandré and Létienne dressed her body in her favorite beige lace dress and placed her in a coffin with a sprig of lilac. At 7 am, a Russian Orthodox priest arrived to say prayers over her body. At 7:30 am, her coffin was taken to the mortuary chapel attaching the Catholic hospital in The Hague.
In accordance with old ballet tradition, on the day she was to have next performed, the show went on, as scheduled, with a single spotlight circling an empty stage where Pavlova would have been. Memorial services were held in the Russian Orthodox Church in London. She was cremated and her ashes placed in a columbarium at Golders Green Crematorium, where her urn was adorned with her ballet shoes (which have since been stolen).

Pavlova&#x27;s ashes have been a source of much controversy, following attempts by Valentina Zhilenkova and Moscow mayor Yury Luzhkov to have them flown to Moscow for interment in the Novodevichy Cemetery. These attempts were based on claims that it was Pavlova&#x27;s dying wish that her ashes be returned to Russia following the fall of the Soviet Union. These claims were later found to be false, as there is no evidence to suggest that this was her wish at all. The only documentary evidence that suggests that such a move would be possible is in the will of Pavlova&#x27;s husband, who stipulated that, if Russian authorities agreed to such a move and treated her remains with proper reverence, then the crematorium caretakers should agree to it. Despite this clause, the will does not contain a formal request or plans for a posthumous journey to Russia.

The most recent attempt to move Pavlova&#x27;s remains to Russia came in 2001. Golders Green Crematorium had made arrangements for them to be flown to Russia for interment on 14 March 2001 in a ceremony to be attended by various Russian dignitaries. This plan was later abandoned after Russian authorities withdrew permission for the move. It was later revealed that neither Pavlova&#x27;s family nor the Russian Government had sanctioned the move and that they had agreed the remains should stay in London.

==Filmography==

==Legacy==

Pavlova inspired choreographer Frederick Ashton (1904–1988), who as a boy of 13, saw her dance in the Municipal Theater in Lima, Peru.

The Pavlova dessert is named after her.

Pavlova&#x27;s dances inspired many artworks of the Irish painter John Lavery. The critic of &quot;The Observer&quot; wrote on 16 April 1911: &quot;Mr. Lavery&#x27;s portrait of the Russian dancer Anna Pavlova, caught in a moment of graceful, weightless movement ... Her miraculous, feather-like flight, which seems to defy the law of gravitation&quot;.

The Jarabe Tapatío, known in English as the &quot;Mexican Hat Dance&quot;, gained popularity outside of Mexico when Pavlova created a staged version in pointe shoes, for which she was showered with hats by her adoring Mexican audiences. Afterward, in 1924, the Jarabe Tapatío was proclaimed Mexico&#x27;s national dance.

Pavlova appears as a character, played by Maria Tallchief, in the 1952 film &quot;Million Dollar Mermaid&quot;.

Botanist Roger William Butcher in 1952, circumscribed &quot;Pavlova&quot; which is a genus of algae, belonging to the family Pavlovaceae. This was named so, because &quot;the movement of the type species, &quot;Pavlova gyrans&quot;, is positively balletic&quot;. 

In 1980, Igor Carl Faberge licensed a collection of 8-inch full-lead crystal wine glasses to commemorate the centenary of Pavlova&#x27;s birth. The glasses were crafted in Japan under the supervision of The Franklin Mint. A frosted image of Pavlova appears in the stem of each glass. Originally each set contained 12 glasses.

Pavlova&#x27;s life was depicted in the 1983 film &quot;Anna Pavlova&quot;.

A McDonnell Douglas MD-11 of the Dutch airline KLM, with the registration PH-KCH carried her name. It was delivered on 31 August 1995.

Pavlova appears as a character in Rosario Ferre&#x27;s novel of 2001, &quot;Flight of the Swan&quot;.

Pavlova appears as a character in the fourth episode of the British series &quot;Mr Selfridge&quot; (2013), played by real-life ballerina Natalia Kremen.

Anna Pavlova was feature in a Manga called The War of Greedy Witches(2020), as a fighter and one of the 32 participants.

==Pointe shoes==
Pavlova&#x27;s feet were extremely arched, so she strengthened her pointe shoe by adding a piece of hard leather on the soles for support and flattening the box of the shoe. At the time, many considered this &quot;cheating&quot;, for a ballerina of the era was taught that she, not her shoes, must hold her weight &quot;en pointe&quot;. In Pavlova&#x27;s case, this was extremely difficult, as the shape of her feet required her to balance her weight on her big toes. Her solution became, over time, the precursor of the modern pointe shoe, as pointe work became less painful and easier for curved feet. According to Margot Fonteyn&#x27;s biography, Pavlova did not like the way her invention looked in photographs, so she would remove it or have the photographs altered so that it appeared she was using a normal pointe shoe.

==Choreographic notation==
At the turn of the 20th century, the Imperial Ballet began a project that notated much of its repertory in the Stepanov method of choreographic notation. Most of the notated choreographies were recorded while dancers were being taken through rehearsals. After the revolution of 1917, this collection of notation was taken out of Russia by the Imperial Ballet&#x27;s former &quot;régisseur&quot; Nicholas Sergeyev, who utilized these documents to stage such works as &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;, &quot;The Sleeping Beauty&quot; and &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, as well as Marius Petipa&#x27;s definitive versions of &quot;Giselle&quot; and of &quot;Coppélia&quot; for the Paris Opéra Ballet and the Vic-Wells Ballet of London (precursor of the Royal Ballet). The productions of these works formed the foundation from which all subsequent versions would be based to one extent or another. Eventually, these notations were acquired by Harvard University and are now part of the cache of materials relating to the Imperial Ballet known as the Sergeyev Collection that includes not only the notated ballets but rehearsal scores as used by the company at the turn of the 20th century.

The notations of &quot;Giselle&quot; and the full-length &quot;Paquita&quot; were recorded –1902 while Marius Petipa himself took Anna Pavlova through rehearsals. Pavlova is also included in some of the other notated choreographies when she participated in performances as a soloist. Several of the violin or piano reductions used as rehearsal scores reflect the variations that Pavlova chose to dance in a particular performance, since, at that time, classical variations were often performed ad libitum, i.e. at the dancer&#x27;s choice. One variation, in particular, was performed by Pavlova in several ballets, being composed by Riccardo Drigo for Pavlova&#x27;s performance in Petipa&#x27;s ballet &quot;Le Roi candaule&quot; that features a solo harp. This variation is still performed in modern times in the Mariinsky Ballet&#x27;s staging of the &quot;Paquita&quot; grand pas classique.

<text> () was a province of the Roman Empire in what is now the modern country of France, part of the Celtic territory of Gaul formerly known as Celtica. It is named after its capital Lugdunum (today&#x27;s Lyon), possibly Roman Europe&#x27;s major city west of Italy, and a major imperial mint. Outside Lugdunum was the Sanctuary of the Three Gauls, where representatives met to celebrate the cult of Rome and Augustus.

==History==
In describing his conquest of Gaul (58–50 BC), Julius Caesar distinguished between in the south of Gaul, which already was a Roman province in his time, and the three other parts of Gaul: the territories of the , of the , and of the also known as the . The territory of the Galli extended from the rivers Seine and Marne in the north-east, which formed the boundary with , to the river Garonne in the south-west, which formed the border with . Under Augustus, was created by reducing in size the territory of the Gauls (): the portion between the river Loire and the Garonne was given to , and central-eastern portions were given to the new province of . The map shows the extent after these reductions. The date of the creation of is under discussion, whether between 27 and 25 BC or between 16 and 13 BC, during Augustus&#x27; visits to Gaul.

It was an imperial province, deemed important enough to be governed by an imperial legate. Under the Tetrarchy (AD 296), it was first divided into two, , with its capital at Lyon, and , with its capital at Rouen. This division is recorded in the Verona List. Both new provinces belonged to the diocese of Gaul, alongside the Helvetic, Belgian and German provinces.

Constantine I () divided the provinces again. , with its capital at Sens, was split off from Prima, while , with its capital at Tours, was separated from . According to the , Prima was governed by a , while the other three were governed by a . All the provinces were gradually overrun by invading Franks and Burgundians during the 5th century. What was left of the provinces effectively ceased to exist in AD 486/487 when the Roman general Syagrius, who controlled and , was defeated by the Franks.

The cities and of the four provinces are listed in the late 4th-century by their ethnic titles. The of Mâcon is a later addition to the . They are listed here with their conventional short names (where different from the ethnic name) and their modern names:

<text>R2-D2 () or Artoo-Detoo is a fictional robot character in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise created by George Lucas. He has appeared in ten of the eleven theatrical &quot;Star Wars&quot; films to date, including every film in the &quot;Skywalker Saga&quot;, which includes the original trilogy, the prequel trilogy and the sequel trilogy. At various points throughout the course of the films, R2, an astromech droid, is a friend to C-3PO, Padmé Amidala, Anakin Skywalker, Leia Organa, Luke Skywalker, and Obi-Wan Kenobi. R2-D2 and his companion C-3PO are the only characters to appear in every theatrical &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, with the exception of &quot;&quot; (2018).

English actor Kenny Baker played R2-D2 in all three original &quot;Star Wars&quot; films and received billing credit for the character in the prequel trilogy, where Baker&#x27;s role was reduced as R2-D2 was portrayed mainly by radio controlled props and CGI models. In the sequel trilogy, Baker was credited as consultant for &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;; however, Jimmy Vee also co-performed the character in some scenes. Vee later took over the role beginning in &quot;The Last Jedi&quot;. In &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot;, puppeteers Hassan Taj and Lee Towersey perform the role of R2-D2, replacing Jimmy Vee, who had played the role in the previous two films. His sounds and vocal effects were created by sound designer Ben Burtt.

R2-D2 was designed in artwork by Ralph McQuarrie, co-developed by John Stears and built by Peteric Engineering. The revised &quot;Empire Strikes Back&quot; droids had fibreglass shells built by Tony Dyson and his White Horse Toy Company.

==Design==
George Lucas&#x27;s creation of R2-D2 was influenced by the peasant Matashichi from Akira Kurosawa&#x27;s 1958 film &quot;The Hidden Fortress&quot;. Lucas and artist Ralph McQuarrie also drew inspiration from the robots Huey, Dewey, and Louie from Douglas Trumbull&#x27;s 1972 film &quot;Silent Running&quot;.

The name derives from when Lucas was making one of his earlier films, &quot;American Graffiti&quot;. Sound editor Walter Murch states that he is responsible for the utterance which sparked the name for the droid. Murch asked for Reel 2, Dialog Track 2, in the abbreviated form &quot;R-2-D-2&quot;. Lucas, who was in the room and had dozed off while working on the script for &quot;Star Wars&quot;, momentarily woke when he heard the request and, after asking for clarification, stated that it was a &quot;great name&quot; before going back to writing his script.

R2-D2 stands for Second Generation Robotic Droid Series-2, according to a &quot;Star Wars&quot; encyclopedia published after the release of the film &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Tony Dyson, owner of the special effects studio The White Horse Toy Company, was commissioned by special effects supervisor Brian Johnson to fabricate the revised mechanical design for &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, making several units operated by remote control. A number were used by Baker, and two were stunt double models made for the scene where the droid was shot from the swamp onto the shore on Dagobah.

==Appearances==

=== Original trilogy ===

==== &quot;Star Wars&quot; ====
In &quot;Star Wars&quot;, R2-D2 and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) are both introduced on board the &quot;Tantive IV&quot;, along with Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) of Alderaan, when they are being pursued upon by Darth Vader (portrayed by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) aboard an Imperial Star Destroyer. Leia inserts into R2-D2 an information disc containing the plans for the Death Star battle station, and encodes a distress message on the droid&#x27;s holographic projector. The droids then escape in a pod that crashes on Tatooine near Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi&#x27;s (Alec Guinness) desert abode.

R2-D2 and C-3PO are then abducted by Jawas and bought by Owen (Phil Brown) and Beru Lars (Shelagh Fraser), uncle and aunt of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill). While Luke cleans the sand out of R2-D2&#x27;s gears, he discovers a fragment of Leia&#x27;s message, and removes the droid&#x27;s restraining bolt to see more; once free of the bolt, R2 claims to have no knowledge of the message. That night, R2-D2 leaves the farm to seek out Obi-Wan. When Owen and Beru are killed by Imperial stormtroopers, Luke is forced to leave Tatooine with Obi-Wan, Han Solo (Harrison Ford), and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) on board the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; to deliver R2-D2 to the Rebel Alliance. On their arrival at Alderaan&#x27;s co-ordinates, they are pulled in by the Death Star&#x27;s tractor beam and are forced to land, but eventually rescue Princess Leia. After Vader kills Obi-Wan, the rest of the group escapes and delivers the Death Star plans to the Rebel Alliance. R2 later serves as Luke&#x27;s droid during the attack on the station. R2-D2 is severely damaged during the battle, but is repaired before the ceremony at the end of the film.

==== &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; ====
In &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, R2-D2 accompanies Luke to Dagobah, and later to Cloud City, where he helps to rescue and repair a heavily damaged C-3PO and to override city security computers. He also manages to reactivate the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;″s hyperdrive, resulting in a last-minute escape from Imperial forces.

==== &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; ====
In &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, R2-D2 plays a critical role in rescuing Luke, Leia, and Han from Jabba the Hutt. He later joins the Rebel strike team on Endor. He is badly damaged during the battle between the Imperial troops and the Rebels, but is repaired in time for the celebration marking the second Death Star&#x27;s destruction and the fall of the Empire.

=== Prequel trilogy ===

==== &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; ====
In &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, set 32 years before &quot;A New Hope&quot;, R2-D2 is portrayed as belonging to the Naboo defense forces, one of three astromech droids deployed for repair duty onboard Queen Padmé Amidala&#x27;s (Natalie Portman) starship as it attempts to get past the Trade Federation blockade. The sole survivor of the three, R2-D2 repairs the deflector shields and saves the day. Having proved his worth, R2-D2 then becomes part of Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn&#x27;s (Liam Neeson) party on Tatooine where he meets nine-year-old Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) and C-3PO, whom Anakin built from scrap. Later still, he serves as the astromech droid for Anakin&#x27;s starfighter during the Battle of Naboo, helping Anakin destroy the Trade Federation&#x27;s command center and free the planet Naboo from the Federation&#x27;s grip. R2-D2, along with Anakin and the young Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), are awarded medals by Padmé and Boss Nass (Brian Blessed) at the end of the film.

==== &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; ====
In &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;, set 10 years after &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, R2-D2 again serves Obi-Wan and Anakin (Hayden Christensen), who is now Obi-Wan&#x27;s Jedi apprentice. He accompanies Anakin and Padmé to Naboo, and then to Tatooine when Anakin tries in vain to rescue his mother Shmi (Pernilla August) from a pack of Tusken Raiders. Here, he is reunited with C-3PO, and the two get into various misadventures on the planet Geonosis. He and C-3PO are later witness to Anakin and Padmé&#x27;s secret wedding.

==== &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; ====
In &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, set three years later, R2-D2 helps Anakin and Obi-Wan in their mission to rescue Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from Count Dooku&#x27;s (Christopher Lee) capital ship, the &quot;Invisible Hand&quot;. He is attacked by super battle droids, but he defeats them through ingenious tactics. After Anakin falls to the dark side of the Force and becomes Darth Vader, he takes R2-D2 with him when he goes to assassinate the Separatist council, but he tells him to stay with the ship. After Obi-Wan defeats Vader in a lightsaber duel, R2-D2 goes with him aboard Padmé&#x27;s ship, where he witnesses as Padmé dies after giving birth to her and Vader&#x27;s children, Luke and Leia.

After Palpatine and Vader overthrow the Republic and establish the Galactic Empire at the end of the film, C-3PO&#x27;s memory is erased to keep the knowledge of Luke and Leia&#x27;s locations a secret from their father. However, R2-D2&#x27;s memory is not wiped; as a result, R2-D2 is the only surviving character at the end of the saga who knows the entire story of the Skywalker family. Both R2-D2 and C-3PO end up in the possession of Captain Raymus Antilles (Rohan Nichol) onboard the &quot;Tantive IV&quot;.

=== Sequel trilogy ===

==== &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; ====
In &quot;Star Wars: The Force Awakens&quot;, set approximately 30 years after &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, R2-D2 is revealed to be kept in storage at the Resistance base on the planet D&#x27;Qar, having put himself in a low-power mode after Luke Skywalker&#x27;s disappearance. He later awakens and reveals Luke&#x27;s location by combining map data stored in his memory with that of the droid BB-8. He then travels with Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Chewbacca to the planet highlighted on the map, where they find Luke in self-imposed exile. In the credits, Kenny Baker was credited as &#x27;R2-D2 consultant,&#x27; while Jimmy Vee provided an uncredited portrayal in some scenes.

==== &quot;The Last Jedi&quot; ====
R2-D2 appeared in &quot;Star Wars: The Last Jedi&quot;, with actor Jimmy Vee taking over the role from Kenny Baker, who retired from the role due to his age and health. Baker died in August 2016.

R2-D2 has a brief but pivotal role in the film, reuniting with Luke aboard the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; and showing him Leia&#x27;s distress message from the original film in a successful attempt to convince Luke to train Rey. He is later shown interfacing with the &quot;Falcon&quot;&#x27;s computer while Rey and Chewbacca pilot the ship amid the final confrontation with the evil First Order&#x27;s forces.

==== &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot; ====
R2-D2 returns once more in &quot;Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker&quot;. Initially remaining at the Resistance base, he is shown watching Leia as she dies. He later plays an important role in restoring C-3PO&#x27;s memory after Rey, Finn (John Boyega) and Poe Dameron (Oscar Isaac) are forced to erase it so the droid can translate a Sith artifact that holds a clue to the location of the Sith homeworld, the resurrected Palpatine, and the Sith Eternal&#x27;s fleet, the Final Order. R2-D2 accompanies Poe in his X-wing for the final assault, and is later shown joining the others in celebrating the defeat of Palpatine and the Sith Eternal.

===Anthology films===
====&quot;Rogue One&quot;====

R2-D2 makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Rogue One&quot; alongside C-3PO.

===Television===
R2-D2 and C-3PO had their own animated series, &quot;Star Wars: Droids&quot;, set before they came into Luke Skywalker&#x27;s possession. This was excluded from the new canon in 2014. They also appear in both the live action and animated segments of the &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot;. In the animated segment they are rescued by a mysterious bounty hunter, Boba Fett, who offers to help them. Later R2-D2 intercepts a transmission between Darth Vader and Fett - thus confirming to him, C-3PO and the others Fett&#x27;s true allegiances.

R2-D2 makes a guest appearance with C-3PO, Luke Skywalker (and Mark Hamill) and Chewbacca in an episode of &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;.

R2-D2 appears in the 2008 animated film &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot;, and the subsequent TV series of the same name. In the film, he accompanies Anakin (voiced by Matt Lanter) and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano (voiced by Ashley Eckstein) on a mission to rescue Jabba the Hutt&#x27;s son Rotta. In the series, he helps them fight the Separatists. He previously appeared in &quot;Star Wars: Clone Wars&quot;, but this micro-series has been excluded from the new canon.

R2-D2 also appears in &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; in the episodes &quot;Droids in Distress&quot; and &quot;Blood Sisters&quot;, and in several episodes of &quot;Star Wars Forces of Destiny&quot;.

In the second season finale of the Disney+ series &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;, R2-D2 accompanies Luke Skywalker as he goes to retrieve Grogu to be trained as a Jedi.

R2-D2 appears in the sixth and seventh episodes of &quot;The Mandalorian&quot; spin-off series &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot;. After Grogu decides to abandon his Jedi training, Luke has R2-D2 fly Grogu to Tatooine in his X-wing starfighter so that he may be reunited with his guardian, Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal).

===Novels and comics===

The novelization of &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; makes it clear that R2-D2 has been in Padmé&#x27;s possession since the events of &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;.
R2-D2 appears in Marvel&#x27;s 2015 &quot;Star Wars&quot; comic series, which is set between the films of the original trilogy. He also appears briefly in the miniseries &quot;Star Wars: Shattered Empire&quot;.

====&quot;Legends&quot;====
With the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, most of the licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film &quot;Star Wars&quot; were rebranded as &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014.
* In the various &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels and comics, the droid duo have played a small but significant role. In the Expanded Universe novel &quot;The Swarm War&quot;, R2-D2 inadvertently helps Luke and Leia come to grips with their heritage when an electronic glitch unearths long-concealed images of Anakin relating his fear of losing Padmé, and of Padmé&#x27;s death.
* In issue No. 12 of &quot;Star Wars: Legacy&quot;, R2-D2 is revealed to have survived the resulting 88 years after his last appearance and has been upgraded to the latest technology. In this series, he now serves another member of the Skywalker family – reluctant Jedi Cade Skywalker.

===Other films===
Along with the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, R2-D2 makes non-canon cameo appearances in several other films, including: &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;, where he was seen flying in debris; &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, in which he is seen on the underside of the alien ship; in &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;, in which he is seen on the wall of the room containing the Ark; in &quot;Poltergeist&quot;, where he is seen in several objects on Robbie&#x27;s room; and in &quot;&quot;, where he is seen flying among rubble and debris in the sky. In &quot;Ready Player One&quot;, R2-D2 is also seen as a toy model in Wade and Samantha&#x27;s apartment. He also appears in the &quot;Wreck-It Ralph&quot; sequel, &quot;Ralph Breaks the Internet&quot;.

In an early script to 2014&#x27;s &quot;The Lego Movie&quot;, R2-D2 was set to be one of the main characters, but was written out due to the directors failing to obtain the rights to the character.

==Production==

Several R2-D2 models were built for the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; films; one that was remote controlled and rolled on three wheeled legs, and others which were worn by English actor Kenny Baker and walked on two legs. Deep Roy served as Baker&#x27;s double, in both &quot;Episodes V&quot; and &quot;VI&quot;; providing stunts and filling in when Baker was unavailable. The original props for &quot;Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope&quot; were designed by John Stears and built by Stears&#x27; team and Peteric Engineering. The revised fibreglass droids used in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; were built by Tony Dyson and the White Horse Toy Company. The radio controlled R2 was operated by John Stears in &quot;A New Hope&quot;, Brian Johnson in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and by Kit West in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;.

Kenny Baker, who portrayed R2-D2 in costume, was not involved in the &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot;. R2-D2 was portrayed entirely by a radio controlled unit, operated by Mick Garris (Lucas&#x27; receptionist at the time). In the credits, R2-D2 is credited as playing himself. Garris later went on to operate the radio controlled R2-D2 at various events, including the Oscars.

There were a total of 15 R2-D2s on the set of &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;. Eight were radio-controlled; two were worn by Baker; the remainder were stunt models that could be moved by puppet strings or towed by wires. The robotic R2-D2s were prone to failure, particularly while shooting the Tatooine scenes in Tunisia.

Radio-controlled units were extensively utilized for the Prequel trilogy due to advances in technology, though Baker was still used in some scenes. R2-D2 had three principal operators: Don Bies, Jolyon Bambridge and Grant Imahara.

The sound effects for R2-D2&#x27;s &quot;voice&quot; were created by sound designer Ben Burtt, using an ARP 2600 analog synthesizer, as well as his own vocalizations processed through other effects. Original props of R2-D2 and C-3PO are used as Audio-Animatronics in the queue area of Disneyland&#x27;s Star Tours–The Adventures Continue attraction.

Although Kenny Baker is credited, Anthony Daniels (who portrays C-3PO) has stated that Baker did not film any scenes in &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;. Baker himself has said he probably only appears in footage caught while shooting the previous two movies.

For &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, producer Kathleen Kennedy hired two fans, Lee Towersey and Oliver Steeples, to build new R2-D2 robots for the film, after being impressed by their working replicas that were brought to &quot;Star Wars&quot; Celebration Europe in 2013.
Towersey was also one of the two puppeteers, along with Hassan Taj, who operated the droid in &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot;.

Ewan McGregor, who portrayed Obi-Wan Kenobi in the Star Wars prequel trilogy, said in an interview, &quot;As soon as R2-D2 comes on the set, everyone goes a bit silly.&quot; He said &quot;there is something about him that makes you feel great affection for him&quot;. In the DVD audio commentary for &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, George Lucas says R2-D2 is his favorite character, and that it is intentional that R2-D2 saves the day at least once in every film.

==Cultural influence==

R2-D2 was inducted into the Robot Hall of Fame in 2003 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A replica can be seen at the Carnegie Science Center in Pittsburgh. The Smithsonian Institution included R2-D2 in its list of 101 Objects that Made America. In 2022 R2-D2 was surveyed as being the most popular movie robot in the United States.

R2-D2 and C-3PO guest starred in a two episodes of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in 1980. The two droids were featured as presenters at the 50th Academy Awards.

The telescope dome of Zweibrücken Observatory in Germany was repainted to resemble R2-D2 in 2018.

In the Latin American Spanish dubbing of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; films, the name R2-D2 is pronounced as &quot;Arturito&quot; (Little Arthur), which sounds similar to the English pronunciation.

In the Italian version of the original trilogy, was named &quot;C1-P8&quot;. Anglicisms were not common in the Italian language during the 1970s and 1980s, and the names of various characters were changed to be easier to pronounce and recognize for Italian speakers. Some of these changes were reverted in the dubbing of the prequel and sequel trilogies, where the original name was used instead.

Around the same time that &quot;A New Hope&quot; was being shot, Ray Harryhausen had already created &quot;Bubo&quot; for the 1981 film &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot;. In the film, Bubo is a mechanical metal owl that flies heavily and communicates through whistles and tweets. Harryhausen denied a relation.

<text>The Posse Comitatus Act is a United States federal law (, original at ) signed on June 18, 1878, by President Rutherford B. Hayes that limits the powers of the federal government in the use of federal military personnel to enforce domestic policies within the United States. Congress passed the Act as an amendment to an army appropriation bill following the end of Reconstruction and updated it in 1956, 1981 and 2021.

The Act originally applied only to the United States Army, but a subsequent amendment in 1956 expanded its scope to the United States Air Force. In 2021, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2022 further expanded the scope of the Act to cover the United States Navy, Marine Corps, and Space Force. The Act does not prevent the Army National Guard or the Air National Guard under state authority from acting in a law enforcement capacity within its home state or in an adjacent state if invited by that state&#x27;s governor. The United States Coast Guard (under the Department of Homeland Security) is not covered by the Act either, primarily because although it is an armed service, it also has a maritime law enforcement mission.

The title of the Act comes from the legal concept of &quot;posse comitatus&quot;, the authority under which a county sheriff, or another law officer, can conscript any able-bodied person to assist in keeping the peace.

==History==
The Act, § 15 of the appropriations bill for the Army for 1879 (found at ) was a response to, and subsequent prohibition of, the military occupation of the former Confederate States by the United States Army during the twelve years of Reconstruction (1865–1877) following the American Civil War (1861–1865).

The U.S. Constitution places primary responsibility for the holding of elections in the hands of the individual states. The maintenance of peace, conduct of orderly elections, and prosecution of unlawful actions are all state responsibilities, according to any state&#x27;s role of exercising police power and maintaining law and order, whether part of a wider federation or a unitary state. However, in the former Confederate States, many paramilitary groups sought to suppress, often through intimidation and violence, African-American political power and return the South to rule by the predominantly white Democratic Party. Although African Americans were initially supported by the federal government, as Reconstruction went on, that support waned. Following the bitterly disputed 1876 U.S. presidential election and Compromise of 1877, Congressmen and Senators from the former Confederate States returned to Washington and prioritized prohibiting the federal government from reimposing control over their states. After President Hayes used federal troops to end the Great Railroad Strike of 1877, there was sufficient bipartisan support to pass what became the Posse Comitatus Act.

The original Posse Comitatus Act referred exclusively to the United States Army. The Air Force, established during the 20th century initially as a branch of the Army, was added in 1956. The Navy and Marine Corps were not mentioned in the Act but were subject to the same restrictions by Department of Defense regulation until their inclusion in the act in 2021. The Space Force, established in 2020, was also included in the Act in 2021. The United States Coast Guard is not included in the act even though it is part of the six armed services as it is explicitly given federal law enforcement authority on maritime law. The modern Coast Guard did not exist at the time the Act became law in 1878. Its predecessor, the United States Revenue Cutter Service, was primarily a customs enforcement agency and part of the United States Department of the Treasury. In 1915, when the Revenue Cutter Service and the United States Lifesaving Service were amalgamated to form the Coast Guard, the service was both made a military branch and given federal law enforcement authority.

In the mid-20th century, the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower used an exception to the Posse Comitatus Act, derived from the Enforcement Acts, to send federal troops into Little Rock, Arkansas, during the 1957 school desegregation crisis. The Arkansas governor had opposed desegregation after the United States Supreme Court ruled in 1954 in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; that segregated public schools were unconstitutional. The Enforcement Acts, among other powers, allowed the president to call up military forces when state authorities were either unable or unwilling to suppress violence that was in opposition to the citizens&#x27; constitutional rights.

In the summer of 2020, the George Floyd protests in Washington, D.C. generated controversy when National Guard troops were called in to suppress protests without President Donald Trump&#x27;s invoking the Insurrection Act (though he threatened to do so). One set of troops, the District of Columbia National Guard, has historically operated as the equivalent of a state militia (under Title 32 of the United States Code) not subject to Posse Comitatus Act restrictions, even though it is a federal entity under the command of the President and the Secretary of the Army. National Guard troops from cooperative states were also called in at the request of federal agencies, some of whom were deputized as police. Attorney General William Barr cited , which says National Guard troops may engage in &quot;support of operations or missions undertaken by the member&#x27;s unit at the request of the President or Secretary of Defense.&quot; Saying the intent of §502 (titled &quot;Required drills and field exercises&quot;) was to cover training exercises only, Senator Tom Udall and U.S. Representative Jim McGovern described this as a &quot;loophole&quot; to circumvent Posse Comitatus Act restrictions, and introduced legislation to close it.

In 2020, U.S. Representative Adam Schiff introduced an amendment to the Act to expand its coverage to include the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, and Space Force. This amendment was eventually included in the 2022 National Defense Authorization Act.

==Legislation==
The original provision was enacted as Section 15 of chapter 263, of the Acts of the 2nd session of the 45th Congress.
The text of the relevant legislation is as follows:

Also notable is the following provision within Title 10 of the United States Code (which concerns generally the organization and regulation of the armed forces and Department of Defense):

===2006–2007 suspension===

In 2006, Congress modified the Insurrection Act as part of the 2007 Defense Authorization Bill (repealed as of 2008). On September 26, 2006, President George W. Bush urged Congress to consider revising federal laws so that U.S. armed forces could restore public order and enforce laws in the aftermath of a natural disaster, terrorist attack or incident, or other condition. These changes were included in the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 (), which was signed into law on October 17, 2006.

Section 1076 is titled &quot;Use of the Armed Forces in major public emergencies&quot;. It provided that:
In 2008, these changes in the Insurrection Act of 1807 were repealed in their entirety, reverting to the previous wording of the Insurrection Act. It was initially written to limit presidential power as much as possible in the event of insurrection, rebellion, or lawlessness.

==Exceptions, exclusions, and limitations==
There are several situations in which the Act does not apply. These include:

* General criminal and criminal counterintelligence investigations, when there is a nexus to a particular military branch, conducted by civilian agents of certain independent military investigative agencies, such as: Air Force Office of Special Investigations (OSI), Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS), United States Army Criminal Investigation Division (CID), and United States Army Counterintelligence (ACI). The Posse Comitatus Act (PCA) specifically states, &quot;except in cases and under circumstances expressly authorized by the Constitution or Act of Congress&quot; with the following Acts of Congress providing specific statutory law enforcement authorities to include:
** Under , civilian Special Agents of ACI and CID can execute and serve arrest and search warrants and likewise pertains to investigative activities associated with those authorities.
** Under , civilian Special Agents of NCIS can execute and serve arrest and search warrants and likewise pertains to investigative activities associated with those authorities.
** Under , civilian Special Agents of OSI can execute and serve arrest and search warrants and likewise pertains to investigative activities associated with those authorities.

* National Guard units, state defense forces, and naval militias while under the authority of the governor of a state. However, when the National Guard is under federal control via , that shifts control from the state governor to the president, making National Guard operations subject to the Posse Comitatus Act as well. Finally, under (f), the president can use the National Guard while it is not federalized in a law enforcement capacity.

* Federal troops used in accordance to the Insurrection Act, which has been invoked 23 times, .

* Under , the Attorney General may request that the Secretary of Defense provide emergency assistance if domestic law enforcement is inadequate to address specific types of threats involving the release of nuclear materials, such as potential use of a nuclear or radiological weapon. Such assistance may be by any personnel under the authority of the Department of Defense, provided such assistance does not adversely affect U.S. military preparedness. The only exemption is the deployment of nuclear materials on the part of the United States Armed Forces.

* Under , the Attorney General may request assistance from the military in enforcement of laws regarding biological, chemical, or other weapons of mass destruction (, , and ).

* Under , , and , the Attorney General may request that any other federal, state, or local agency, including the military, assist in the enforcement of laws protecting foreign diplomats and their families.

* Under , the military may assist in responding to terrorist bombings, particularly in terms of explosive ordnance disposal.

* Under , the military may provide surveillance, intelligence gathering, observation, and equipment for domestic law enforcement on operations such as drug interdiction and counter-terrorism missions. For example, Delta Force soldiers from Fort Bragg were deployed upon request by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to serve as sniper/observer teams, run communications, provide medical support, gather intelligence, and conduct assistance in explosive breaching during the 1987 Atlanta prison riots.

===Exclusion applicable to U.S. Coast Guard===
Although it is an armed service, the U.S. Coast Guard, which operates under the United States Department of Homeland Security during peacetime, is not restricted by the Posse Comitatus Act and has explicit authority to enforce federal law. This is true even when the Coast Guard operates as a service within the United States Navy during wartime.

In December 1981, the Military Cooperation with Civilian Law Enforcement Agencies Act was enacted, clarifying permissible military assistance to domestic law enforcement agencies and the Coast Guard, especially in combating drug smuggling into the United States. Posse Comitatus clarifications emphasize supportive and technical assistance (such as the use of facilities, vessels, and aircraft, as well as intelligence support, technological aid, and surveillance) while generally prohibiting direct participation of U.S. military personnel in law enforcement (such as search, seizure, and arrests). For example, a U.S. Navy vessel may be used to track, follow, and stop a vessel suspected of drug smuggling, but Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachments (LEDETs) embarked aboard the Navy vessel would perform the actual boarding and, if needed, arrest the suspect vessel&#x27;s crew.

===Advisory and support roles===
Federal troops have a long history of domestic roles, including occupying secessionist Southern states during Reconstruction and putting down major urban riots. The Posse Comitatus Act prohibits using active duty personnel to &quot;execute the laws&quot;; however, there is disagreement over whether this language may apply to troops used in an advisory, support, disaster response, or other homeland defense role, as opposed to domestic law enforcement.

On March 10, 2009, members of the U.S. Army Military Police Corps from Fort Rucker were deployed to Samson, Alabama, in response to a shooting spree. Samson officials confirmed that the soldiers assisted in traffic control and securing the crime scene. The governor of Alabama did not request military assistance, nor did President Barack Obama authorize their deployment. Subsequent investigation found that the Posse Comitatus Act was violated and several military members received &quot;administrative actions&quot;.

<doc id="63170" wikidata="Q51787" url="?curid=63170" title="C-3PO">
<text>C-3PO () or See-Threepio is a humanoid robot character in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. He is a protocol droid designed to assist in etiquette and translation, and is fluent in over six million forms of communication. The character appears in all nine films of the Skywalker Saga—which includes the original trilogy, the prequel trilogy and the sequel trilogy. Anthony Daniels portrays in all the Skywalker Saga films and the standalone film &quot;Rogue One,&quot; and voices the droid in the animated film &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;. In addition to films, appears in television series, novels, comics, and video games.

== Creation and development ==
Ralph McQuarrie, a concept artist for the original 1977 &quot;Star Wars&quot; film, based the initial design for on the female robot from the Fritz Lang film &quot;Metropolis&quot; (1927). When Anthony Daniels saw one of McQuarrie&#x27;s paintings of , he was struck by the vulnerability in the droid&#x27;s face, and he wanted the role. George Lucas, who created the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise and directed &quot;Star Wars&quot;, selected Daniels for the physical performance. He was planning to hire another actor for the droid&#x27;s voice, because he was hesitant to give the character Daniels&#x27;s British accent. According to Daniels, Lucas wanted to have a &quot;sleazy New York second-hand car dealer&quot; type of voice. Daniels recalled that thirty well-established actors auditioned for the voice role—including Richard Dreyfuss and Mel Blanc—but Daniels ultimately received the part after one of the actors suggested the idea to Lucas. With Daniels voicing him, &#x27;s persona transformed from oily used-car salesman to neurotic English butler.

For the second film, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), Lucas wanted to create audience sympathy for by having him get dismantled. He considered having the villain Darth Vader destroy the droid&#x27;s heart or &quot;turn it into an alarm clock&quot;. In the finished film, is blasted into pieces by an offscreen foe, then rescued from a scrap pile by Chewbacca. Because both and Chewbacca were likeable characters—and disliked one another—Lucas wanted them to have a bonding experience. Towards this end, the Wookiee carries and then repairs the dismantled droid.

== Portrayals ==
Anthony Daniels plays C-3PO in ten live-action films. He both physically portrays the character and provides the voice in all of these films except for &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;. For that film, a puppet was operated by Michael Lynch, with Daniels providing the voice. Although &quot;Star Wars&quot; was immensely successful, Daniels was initially hesitant to return for the first sequel, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. According to Daniels, the publicists for &quot;Star Wars&quot; wanted to give the impression that C-3PO was portrayed by a real robot, and not an actor in a costume. Although Daniels felt his acting was undervalued, he eventually agreed to return for a higher salary.

Daniels portrays C-3PO in the television series &quot;Obi-Wan Kenobi&quot; and &quot;Ahsoka&quot;, and voices the droid in the animated film &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;. He also voices the character in the &quot;Star Wars Holiday Special&quot;,&quot;&quot; the radio drama adaptations of the original trilogy, various &quot;Lego Star Wars&quot; series and specials, and the series &quot;Droids&quot;, &quot;Clone Wars&quot;, &quot;The Clone Wars&quot;, &quot;Forces of Destiny&quot;, &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; and &quot;Star Wars Resistance&quot;. In video games, C-3PO is voiced by Daniels, Tom Kane and Tony Pope. Simon Pegg voices the character in a &quot;Star Wars&quot;-themed episode of the animated television series &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;.

== Appearances ==

=== Original trilogy ===
C-3PO first appears in &quot;Star Wars&quot; (1977) aboard a Rebel ship that is boarded by the Empire. Princess Leia hides C-3PO and his companion droid R2-D2 in an escape pod, which she jettisons over the planet Tatooine. There, the droids are captured by Jawas, who sell them to Owen Lars. While cleaning R2-D2, Lars&#x27;s nephew Luke Skywalker discovers a message in the droid that Leia recorded for Obi-Wan Kenobi. After Imperial stormtroopers destroy the Lars homestead, C-3PO and R2-D2 go along with Luke and Obi-Wan on a mission to rescue Leia, transported by the smugglers Han Solo and Chewbacca on board the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;. While on the Death Star, C-3PO and R2-D2 shut down the space station&#x27;s trash compactor to save the lives of their companions. The group then escapes the station and joins the Rebels at their base. When R2-D2 is damaged during the Battle of Yavin, a grief-stricken C-3PO offers to donate his own parts to repair his counterpart.

In &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), C-3PO identifies an Imperial probe droid, which gives the Rebels advance warning of an Imperial attack on their base on Hoth. C-3PO escapes the planet with Han, Chewbacca and Leia on the &quot;Millennium Falcon.&quot; They eventually arrive in Cloud City, where C-3PO is blasted apart by a stormtrooper. After searching for the protocol droid, Chewbacca finds him dismantled on a conveyer belt. The Wookiee later tries to rebuild C-3PO, but puts his head on backwards. Chewbacca carries the partially-rebuilt droid on his back during Han&#x27;s encasement in carbonite. With the help of Lando Calrissian, C-3PO and his friends escape from Darth Vader. Onboard the &quot;Falcon&quot;, R2-D2 successfully repairs C-3PO.

At the beginning of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), Luke sends C-3PO and R2-D2 to the palace of the crime lord Jabba the Hutt, who has purchased the frozen Han from the bounty hunter Boba Fett. To C-3PO&#x27;s dismay, R2-D2 plays a recorded message in which Luke offers the droids as a goodwill gift to Jabba. Now in the service of the crime lord, C-3PO acts as a translator as Leia, Chewbacca, Lando and Luke arrive at the palace to liberate Han. Jabba foils the plan, but Luke leads a successful escape attempt and the group departs the planet. On Endor, C-3PO and his companions are captured by Ewoks, but are released after they perceive C-3PO to be a deity. Later that night, C-3PO narrates the history of the Rebellion&#x27;s fight against the Empire to the Ewok tribe, which convinces them to help the Rebels. After the second Death Star is destroyed, C-3PO and his friends celebrate the fall of the Empire.

=== Prequel trilogy ===
C-3PO returns in &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999), the first film of the prequel trilogy. The film reveals that C-3PO was built on Tatooine by the nine-year-old slave boy Anakin Skywalker. The protocol droid meets his future companion, R2-D2, along with Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn, Queen Padmé Amidala of Naboo and the Gungan Jar Jar Binks. C-3PO and R2-D2 help improve Anakin&#x27;s podracer for the Boonta Eve Classic race, and C-3PO becomes part of Anakin&#x27;s pit crew. C-3PO and Anakin part ways when Qui-Gon frees the boy from slavery and takes him off-planet. Before leaving, Anakin assures the droid that his mother Shmi will not sell him.

&quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002) is set ten years after &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;. Shmi is kidnapped by a group of Tusken Raiders. Sensing that his mother is in danger, Anakin travels with Padmé to Tatooine, where they reunite with C-3PO. He presents Anakin and Padmé to Anakin&#x27;s stepfamily: Owen Lars, Cliegg Lars and Beru Whitesun. When Anakin returns with his mother&#x27;s body, C-3PO attends her funeral. When Anakin and Padmé depart Tatooine, C-3PO accompanies them to the planet Geonosis to rescue Obi-Wan from the Sith Lord Count Dooku. Shortly afterward, he follows R2-D2 into a droid-construction factory, where his head is exchanged with that of a battle droid. Influenced by the battle droid&#x27;s programming, C-3PO reluctantly participates in the film&#x27;s climactic battle scene. After being restored by R2-D2, he leaves Geonosis with his companions. At the end of the film, he is a witness to Padmé and Anakin&#x27;s marriage on Naboo.

In &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005), C-3PO is aware of Padmé&#x27;s pregnancy. After Anakin falls to the dark side of the Force and becomes the Sith Lord Darth Vader, he takes C-3PO and R2-D2 with him as he massacres the Jedi. C-3PO rationalizes Vader&#x27;s behavior by saying he has been under a great deal of stress. The protocol droid accompanies Padmé to Mustafar, where he witnesses Vader strangle her into unconsciousness. C-3PO and R2-D2 then take her to safety. When Obi-Wan returns to their spaceship following his duel with Vader, C-3PO pilots it to Polis Massa and witnesses Padmé give birth to the Skywalker twins, Luke and Leia. C-3PO and R2-D2 become the property of Captain Raymus Antilles, who orders C-3PO&#x27;s memory erased to protect the Skywalker children from their father and the newly created Galactic Empire.

=== Sequel trilogy ===
C-3PO appears in &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; (2015), the first installment of the sequel trilogy. He has a red left arm at one point, and is now fluent in seven million forms of communication. He is first seen with Leia and a Resistance team picking up Han, Chewbacca, Finn, Rey, and BB-8 on the planet Takodana. During their adventures, C-3PO is reunited with R2-D2, who is reactivated after being shut off for years. In &quot;The Last Jedi&quot; (2017), C-3PO serves as an assistant to Leia and the Resistance pilot Poe Dameron. Daniels complained that his character was a &quot;table decoration&quot; in this film, and that C-3PO is &quot;worth more than that&quot;.

In &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019), the droid and his companions travel to Passana, where they search for a clue to the location of a Sith wayfinder. With the help of Lando, they locate the clue—a dagger with inscriptions in the Sith language. C-3PO is able to translate the runes, but his programming prevents him from sharing the translation with his friends. The group travels to Kijimi, where a black-market droid-smith extracts the message from C-3PO, erasing his memory in the process. When C-3PO returns to the Resistance camp, R2-D2 is able to restore his memory.

He also appears in the radio adaptations of the original film trilogy (1981, 1983, and 1996).

== &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; ==

Following the acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company in 2012, most of the licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels and comics produced between 1977 and 2014 were rebranded as &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; and declared non-canon to the franchise. The &quot;Legends&quot; works comprise a separate narrative universe.

=== Novels ===
In &quot;The Truce at Bakura&quot; (1994), C-3PO translates Ssi-ruuvi, the language of the Ssi-ruuk, to aid the Alliance.

In &quot;Dark Force Rising&quot; (1992), C-3PO goes to Honoghr with Leia during the Thrawn Crisis to discover what caused the plight of the Noghri. He is forced to hide with Leia and Chewbacca when Imperial forces arrive, but later returns to Coruscant, where Leia gives birth to Jaina and Jacen Solo. He cares for the twins, and later Anakin Solo as well. C-3PO accompanies Han, Lando, R2-D2, Luke, Chewbacca, and Mara Jade to Wayland in &quot;The Last Command&quot; (1993). The party recruits aid from the local population and destroys the Mount Tantiss storehouse.

In &quot;Dark Apprentice&quot; (1994), the Solo twins elude Chewbacca and C-3PO during a trip to a Coruscant zoo, and arrive in the planet&#x27;s sub-levels. C-3PO frantically searches for them, but they are found by King Onibald Daykim and reunited with their parents. C-3PO and R2-D2 accompany Leia on a diplomatic mission to Nam Chorios in &quot;Planet of Twilight&quot; (1997).

In &quot;The Crystal Star&quot; (1994), C-3PO accompanies Luke and Han to Crseih Station to investigate the possible existence of Jedi trainees, but instead find Waru, a creature from another dimension. They learn of Waru&#x27;s alliance with Lord Hethrir and of the kidnapping of the Solo children. Hethrir is destroyed following a confrontation with Leia, Han, and Luke.

In &quot;The Black Fleet Crisis&quot; trilogy, C-3PO accompanies Lando, R2-D2, and Lando&#x27;s associate Lobot to investigate the runaway alien ship &quot;Teljkon Vagabond&quot;. They eventually discover that the ship contains the last vestiges of the Quella civilization. In &quot;The New Rebellion&quot; (1997), C-3PO and several companions are instrumental in stopping Kueller from regaining power by disabling explosive devices he had placed in a large number of droids.

In the &quot;Star Wars Tales&quot; story &quot;Thank the Maker&quot;, Vader remembers finding the defunct droid in Watto&#x27;s junk heap and guessing it was several decades old. In the &quot;Star Wars: Republic&quot; story &quot;The New Face of War&quot;, Queen Jamillia appoints C-3PO to serve as a liaison to the Jedi. In 1994, Dark Horse Comics serialized a story titled &quot;Droids,&quot; which led to a 14-issue comic series continuing the adventures of and before the events of &quot;Star Wars&quot;. Lucasfilm did not require this series to align narratively with the animated series &quot;Droids&quot;. Anthony Daniels and Ryder Windham also co-wrote a 1997 one-shot comic titled &quot;The Protocol Offensive&quot;.

In &quot;Empire&#x27;s End&quot; (1997), C-3PO and R2-D2 are nearly destroyed after they spot an Imperial installing a homing beacon on the&quot; Millennium Falcon&quot;, but are saved by Han and Chewbacca.

Palpatine eventually finds them, but is mortally wounded by Han and destroyed when Empatojayos Brand sacrifices himself to save Anakin Solo. C-3PO is found partially destroyed and abandoned by two slave boys, Otalp and Remoh, in the &quot;Star Wars Tales&quot; story &quot;Storyteller&quot;, which takes place after the original film trilogy. The droid tells them stories of Luke&#x27;s adventures, and they imagine the stories played out by members of their own alien race. As he is finishing his tale, a Vindar slavedriver appears, blasts C-3PO&#x27;s head off, and kills Otalp. Later, Remoh finds hope for his people&#x27;s freedom when he discovers a lightsaber in the remains of C-3PO&#x27;s body. 

=== Animated series ===
In addition to novels and comics, some animated series are part of &quot;Star Wars&quot; &quot;Legends.&quot; In &quot;Droids&quot; (1985), which takes place between &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot;, C-3PO and R2-D2 are traded among various masters. In &quot;Clone Wars&quot; (2003), C-3PO&#x27;s outer plating is upgraded during his tenure as Padmé&#x27;s servant.

<doc id="63171" wikidata="Q51730" url="?curid=63171" title="Yoda">
<text>Yoda () is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise. He is a small, green humanoid alien who is powerful with the Force. He first appeared in the 1980 film &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, in which he is voiced and puppeteered by Frank Oz, who reprised the role in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), the prequel trilogy, the sequel trilogy, and the animated series &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;. Other actors who voice Yoda are Tom Kane, Piotr Michael, John Lithgow, Tony Pope and Peter McConnell. In addition to films and television series, Yoda appears in comics, novels, video games and commercials.

In the original trilogy, Yoda lives in solitude on the swamp planet Dagobah. He is introduced as a former mentor of Obi-Wan Kenobi, and he trains Luke Skywalker in the ways of the Force until his death at the age of 900. In the prequel films, Yoda leads the Jedi High Council and trains young Jedi until they are assigned to a master. When the Clone Wars break out, he becomes a general in the army of the Republic and leads several legions of clone troopers. Yoda is one of the few Jedi to survive the events of Order 66 at the end of the war, when he battles Darth Sidious and is forced to go into hiding. Yoda&#x27;s Force spirit appears again in the sequel trilogy, advising an older Luke on his training of Rey.

==Creation==
The &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise was created by George Lucas, who wrote and directed the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film (1977). He created the character Obi-Wan Kenobi as a mentor for Luke Skywalker, and originally planned for Obi-Wan to continue training Luke in the sequel, &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. However, Lucas ultimately decided that Obi-Wan would die in the first film. Lucas then introduced a new mentor character, who was originally a diminutive frog-like creature called &quot;Minch Yoda&quot;. The name &quot;Yoda&quot; was chosen because Lucas envisioned the character as a &quot;little Dalai Lama&quot;, and he wanted him to have an &quot;Eastern-sounding&quot; name. One of the film&#x27;s screenwriters, Lawrence Kasdan, said that Yoda was based on Shimada, the lead samurai from the 1954 Akira Kurosawa film &quot;Seven Samurai&quot;. According to Lucas, the narrative goal of Yoda&#x27;s design was to teach Luke &quot;to respect everybody and pay attention to the poorest person&quot;. Lucas wanted the Jedi Master to be the &quot;exact opposite&quot; of what audiences would expect.

The film&#x27;s visual effects art director, Joe Johnston, sketched hundreds of different versions of Yoda. The design that Lucas finally settled on was described by Johnston as a combination of a leprechaun, a troll and a gnome. Lucas gave Yoda a backward speech pattern because he felt the character needed a unique way of speaking that was more dramatic than an accent. The filmmakers considered several ways of portraying Yoda before they decided on a sophisticated puppet. These potential methods included dressing a monkey, a child or a dwarf in a Yoda costume, or using stop-motion animation.

==Portrayal==
Yoda was originally portrayed by a puppet created by Stuart Freeborn and Wendy Froud. Freeborn based Yoda&#x27;s face on his own facial features and those of Albert Einstein, hoping the latter inspiration would make the character appear intelligent. Lucas asked Jim Henson, the creator of the Muppets, to perform the puppeteering for Yoda. Henson was busy with another project, however, and recommended Frank Oz for the role. To perform Yoda in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, Oz inserted his hand into the puppet&#x27;s head to manipulate the mouth and brow. Kathryn Mullen, Wendy Froud and David Barclay operated Yoda&#x27;s eyes, ears and other body parts using cables, strings, hydraulics and electronic mechanisms. There was also a radio-controlled Yoda puppet that was used when the Jedi Master is riding on Luke&#x27;s back. Lucas had intended for a different actor to provide Yoda&#x27;s voice, but ultimately decided that Oz was the best performer for the role.

In the original 1999 release of &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;, Yoda was portrayed by a new puppet in all but two shots. In these two wide shots, the character was created using computer-generated imagery (CGI). The puppet was replaced with a digital Yoda in the 2011 Blu-ray release and the 2012 theatrical 3D release. In &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002) and &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005), Yoda is entirely computer-generated. The digital character accomplishes movements not possible with the puppet, such as fighting with a lightsaber. In &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot;, his face is shown in several close-ups, which required highly detailed CGI work.

Yoda uses the object-subject-verb word order giving him his distinctive speaking style.

==Reception==
Yoda was well-received by several prominent critics when he debuted in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; in 1980. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called him &quot;delightful&quot; and &quot;the hit of the movie&quot;, but felt he was only a success when used sparingly. Joy Gould Boyum of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; praised the &quot;exquisitely constructed&quot; Yoda puppet, and said that Oz &quot;so finely put together [the character]...as to make us wonder continually if he isn&#x27;t real.&quot; Arthur Knight of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; and Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; similarly felt that Yoda was incredibly lifelike, with Arnold comparing his face to that of a human actor. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called Yoda the highlight of the film, while &quot;People&quot; magazine called him a pivotal character. In his review of the 1997 re-release of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, Roger Ebert praised the range of emotions conveyed by Yoda, and said his acting was possibly the best in the film.

Yoda has been a popular character since his introduction more than forty years ago. Brandon Katz of &quot;Observer&quot; has called him an icon of cinema. &quot;Empire&quot; magazine claimed that after the droids C-3PO and R2-D2, Yoda is the &quot;most beloved&quot; character in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise.

==Appearances==
===Original trilogy===

Yoda was introduced in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1980), in which he is puppeteered and voiced by Frank Oz. In the film, Luke arrives on Dagobah to seek his guidance at the behest of Force spirit. At first, Yoda does not identify himself to Luke and instead tests his patience by provoking him. Luke is shocked when he discovers that this small, eccentric creature is the powerful Jedi Master he was seeking. Finding Luke to be impatient and undisciplined, Yoda is reluctant to mentor him in the ways of the Force, but agrees to the task after conferring with Obi-Wan. Before finishing his training, Luke chooses to leave Dagobah to confront Darth Vader and help his friends in Cloud City. Yoda and Obi-Wan warn that he is not ready, but Luke leaves anyway. When Obi-Wan laments that Luke is their &quot;last hope&quot;, Yoda reminds him that &quot;there is another&quot;.

Yoda appears briefly in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1983), again performed and voiced by Oz. Now sick and frail, he tells Luke that his training is complete, but that he will not be a Jedi until he confronts Darth Vader. Yoda also confirms that Vader is Luke&#x27;s father, something Vader had told Luke in the previous film. Yoda then peacefully dies at the age of 900, his body disappearing as he becomes &quot;one with the Force&quot;. He leaves Luke with the knowledge that &quot;there is another Skywalker.&quot; Soon after, Obi-Wan&#x27;s spirit helps Luke realize that the &quot;other&quot; is his twin sister, Princess Leia. In the film&#x27;s final scene, Yoda&#x27;s spirit appears on Endor alongside the spirits of Obi-Wan and Anakin Skywalker.

===Prequel trilogy===

A younger Yoda appears in the prequel trilogy, beginning with &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999). In the film—which is set 35 years before &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;—Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn brings the young Anakin Skywalker to the Jedi Council. Convinced that Anakin is the &quot;Chosen One&quot; of Jedi prophecy who will bring balance to the Force, Qui-Gon requests that the boy be trained as a Jedi. Yoda senses great fear in Anakin, especially in regards to his attachment to his mother Shmi, and foresees &quot;grave danger&quot; in his training. The Council, led by Mace Windu, rejects Qui-Gon&#x27;s request. When Qui-Gon is mortally wounded in a duel with the Sith Lord Darth Maul, his dying request is that his apprentice Obi-Wan Kenobi train Anakin. Obi-Wan tells Yoda that he will train the boy, even without the Council&#x27;s approval. Yoda reluctantly gives his blessing to Anakin&#x27;s training.&quot;Attack of the Clones&quot; (2002) is set a decade after &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;. Yoda is now the Master of the High Council in addition to his position as Grandmaster. He and many other Jedi are concerned about the emergence of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, a secessionist movement seeking independence from the Galactic Republic. After the first attempted assassination of Senator Padmé Amidala, Chancellor Palpatine suggests that she be put under the protection of Obi-Wan, who is training Anakin. At the climax of the film, Yoda saves Obi-Wan and Anakin from the Separatists and defeats his former apprentice, Count Dooku, in a lightsaber duel.

In &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; (2005), Yoda and the Jedi Council pursue the mysterious Sith Lord Darth Sidious. Palpatine has now amassed near-dictatorial emergency powers, and begins interfering in Jedi affairs. The Council orders Anakin to spy on Palpatine, whom he considers a friend and mentor. Anakin seeks Yoda&#x27;s counsel about his prophetic visions that someone close to him will die. Yoda, unaware that Anakin is referring to Padmé, tells him to train himself to let go of everything he fears to lose. Unsatisfied, Anakin turns to Palpatine, who then reveals himself as Darth Sidious. The Sith Lord manipulates the young Jedi into becoming his apprentice, suggesting that the dark side of the Force can save Padmé from dying.

Sidious transforms the Republic into the Galactic Empire, proclaiming himself emperor and ordering the clone troopers to kill their Jedi generals. Through the Force, Yoda feels the deaths of each of the Jedi as they are betrayed by their own troops. After killing the clone troopers instructed to assassinate him, he escapes with the Wookiee leaders Tarfful and Chewbacca to Coruscant, where he and Obi-Wan fight their way into the Jedi Temple. They discover that all the Jedi inside have been slaughtered, including the children. Yoda and Obi-Wan find a recording revealing that Anakin—now known as Darth Vader—was the assassin. Yoda decides to face Sidious, and sends Obi-Wan to kill Vader. When Obi-Wan protests, Yoda tells him that the Anakin he knew no longer exists. Yoda battles Sidious in a lightsaber duel in the Senate. In the end, neither is able to overcome the other and Yoda is forced to retreat. After Padmé dies in childbirth, Yoda recommends that her infant twins Luke and Leia be hidden from Vader and Sidious; he sends Leia to Alderaan and Luke to Tatooine. At the end of the film, it is revealed that Yoda has been learning the secret of immortality from Qui-Gon&#x27;s spirit and passing it on to Obi-Wan.

===Sequel trilogy===

Oz reprises the Yoda role in the sequel trilogy, both as a puppeteer and as a voice actor. The first film of the trilogy, &quot;The Force Awakens&quot; (2015), takes place thirty years after Yoda&#x27;s death in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. When the scavenger Rey has a Force vision and discovers Luke&#x27;s lightsaber, she hears Yoda&#x27;s voice. In &quot;The Last Jedi&quot; (2017), Yoda appears to Luke as a Force spirit. As Luke considers whether to burn down a tree storing sacred Jedi texts, Yoda reminds him that a Jedi must always be sure of his path. When Luke decides to burn down the tree, Yoda summons a lightning bolt and sets it ablaze. Luke is suddenly concerned about the loss of the texts, but Yoda assures him that they contained no knowledge that Rey does not already possess. Yoda&#x27;s voice is heard again in &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot; (2019) when many deceased Jedi are speaking to Rey during her battle against the resurrected Darth Sidious.

===&quot;The Clone Wars&quot;===
Yoda appears in the 2008 animated film &quot;The Clone Wars&quot; and the television series of the same name. He is voiced by Tom Kane in both productions. In the film, he assigns Anakin an apprentice, Ahsoka Tano, believing the responsibility will help him grow as a Jedi and mature as a person. Throughout most of the series, Yoda is on Coruscant with the Jedi Council, but he occasionally leaves for certain tasks, such as negotiations with King Katuunko on Rugosa and a confrontation with Asajj Ventress&#x27;s droid army. Yoda also watches over Anakin and Ahsoka, pleased that they are both maturing with each other&#x27;s influence. In season five, Ahsoka is framed for a crime she did not commit, and Yoda and the Jedi Council turn her over to the Republic military. Before a verdict is read in Ahsoka&#x27;s trial, Anakin reveals the true culprit, the fallen Jedi Barriss Offee. Yoda, Anakin, and the Council then invite Ahsoka to rejoin the Order, but she refuses.

In the sixth season, Yoda hears the voice of the deceased Qui-Gon Jinn. He travels to Dagobah to find answers. He sees cryptic visions of the fall of the Jedi, and learns that he has been chosen to manifest his consciousness after death as a Force spirit. A group of spirit priestesses then gives him various tests, including facing an illusion of the ancient Sith Lord Darth Bane. His final challenge is to resist an attempt by Sidious and Dooku to lure him to the dark side. Yoda engages in a metaphysical battle with Sidious and seemingly sacrifices himself to save Anakin, only to awaken and discover that the battle was merely a vision, and that he passed the test. The priestesses inform Yoda that his training will resume in time.

===&quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot;===
Yoda returns in the animated series &quot;Star Wars Rebels&quot; (2014–2018).&quot;&quot; In the season one episode &quot;Path of the Jedi&quot;, he telepathically communicates with the Jedi apprentice Ezra Bridger and his master Kanan Jarrus, helping the pair to understand their true motivations. In the season two episode &quot;Shroud of Darkness&quot;, Yoda appears to Ezra in a vision.

===&quot;Tales of the Jedi&quot;===
Yoda appears in two episodes of &quot;Tales of the Jedi&quot; (2022), although he has no dialogue. In the third episode, he attends the funeral of Jedi Master Katri, and in the fifth episode he observes the training of Ahsoka.

===Other===
Yoda is voiced by John Lithgow in the radio dramatizations of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; (1983) and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; (1996). He is featured in the audio drama &quot;&quot; and the novel &quot;Master and Apprentice&quot;, both released in 2019. He appears in the web series &quot;Forces of Destiny&quot; (2017–2018), the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Young Jedi Adventures&quot; (2023–present) and the 2021 comic &quot;The High Republic Adventures&quot;, which takes place 200 years before the prequel trilogy. He also makes a non-speaking cameo appearance in the final episode of the television series &quot;The Acolyte&quot; (2024). In 2012, Yoda was featured in a series of Vodafone commercials, which were broadcast in the United Kingdom. 

==&quot;Star Wars Legends&quot;==
Following the acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company in 2012, most of the licensed &quot;Star Wars&quot; novels and comics produced between 1977 and 2014 were rebranded as &quot;Star Wars Legends&quot; and declared non-canon to the franchise. The &quot;Legends&quot; works comprise a separate narrative universe.

===Novels and comics===
Yoda appears in the 2004 Sean Stewart novel &quot;Yoda: Dark Rendezvous&quot;, in which he sends an impersonator of himself to negotiate a treaty with Dooku. He is also a character in the comic series &quot;Star Wars: Republic.&quot;

===&quot;Clone Wars&quot;===
Yoda is voiced by Tom Kane in the animated television series &quot;Clone Wars&quot;, which aired on Cartoon Network from 2003 to 2005. In the series, Yoda becomes a general during the Clone Wars. While escorting Padmé on a journey, he senses a Force disturbance on the planet Ilum. After using a Jedi mind trick to convince Captain Typho to take them there, Yoda saves the lives of two Jedi. In the final episode of the series, Yoda fights alongside Mace Windu to defend Coruscant, which is under attack from the Separatists. The two Jedi Masters realize too late that the battle was intended to distract them from the kidnapping of Palpatine by the Separatist leader General Grievous. &quot;Clone Wars&quot; was removed from the official canon in 2014 and placed in the &quot;Legends&quot; universe.

<text>The Cemetery of Montmartre () is a cemetery in the 18th arrondissement of Paris, France, that dates to the early 19th century. Officially known as the Cimetière du Nord, it is the third largest necropolis in Paris, after the Père Lachaise Cemetery and the Montparnasse Cemetery.

==History==
In the mid-18th century, overcrowding in the cemeteries of Paris had created numerous problems, from impossibly high funeral costs to unsanitary living conditions in the surrounding neighborhoods. In the 1780s, the Cimetière des Innocents was officially closed and citizens were banned from burying corpses within the city limits of Paris. During the early 19th century, new cemeteries were constructed outside the precincts of the capital: Montmartre in the north, Père Lachaise Cemetery in the east, Passy Cemetery in the west and Montparnasse Cemetery in the south.

The Montmartre Cemetery was opened on 1 January 1825. It was initially known as le Cimetière des Grandes Carrières (Cemetery of the Large Quarries). The name referenced the cemetery&#x27;s unique location, in an abandoned gypsum quarry. The quarry had previously been used during the French Revolution as a mass grave. It was built below street level, in the hollow of an abandoned gypsum quarry located west of the &quot;Butte&quot; near the beginning of Rue Caulaincourt in &quot;Place de Clichy.&quot; As is still the case today, its sole entrance was constructed on Avenue Rachel under Rue Caulaincourt.

A popular tourist destination, Montmartre Cemetery is the final resting place of many famous artists who lived and worked in the Montmartre area. See the full list of notable interments below.

<text>Alfred Joyce Kilmer (December 6, 1886 – July 30, 1918) was an American writer and poet mainly remembered for a short poem titled &quot;Trees&quot; (1913), which was published in the collection &quot;Trees and Other Poems&quot; in 1914. Though a prolific poet whose works celebrated the common beauty of the natural world as well as his Catholic faith, Kilmer was also a journalist, literary critic, lecturer, and editor. At the time of his deployment to Europe during World War I, Kilmer was considered the leading American Catholic poet and lecturer of his generation, whom critics often compared to British contemporaries G. K. Chesterton (1874–1936) and Hilaire Belloc (1870–1953). He enlisted in the New York National Guard and was deployed to France with the 69th Infantry Regiment (the famous &quot;Fighting 69th&quot;) in 1917. He was killed by a sniper&#x27;s bullet at the Second Battle of the Marne in 1918 at the age of 31. He was married to Aline Murray, also an accomplished poet and author, with whom he had five children.

While most of his works are largely unknown today, a select few of his poems remain popular and are published frequently in anthologies. Several critics—including both Kilmer&#x27;s contemporaries and modern scholars—have dismissed Kilmer&#x27;s work as being too simple and overly sentimental, and suggested that his style was far too traditional, even archaic. Many writers, including notably Ogden Nash, have parodied Kilmer&#x27;s work and style—as attested by the many imitations of &quot;Trees.&quot;

==Biography==

===Early years and education: 1886–1908===

Kilmer was born December 6, 1886, in New Brunswick, New Jersey, the fourth and youngest child, of Annie Ellen Kilburn (1849–1932), a minor writer and composer, and Dr. Frederick Barnett Kilmer (1851–1934), a physician and analytical chemist employed by the Johnson and Johnson Company and inventor of the company&#x27;s baby powder. He was named Alfred Joyce Kilmer after two priests at Christ Church in New Brunswick: Alfred R. Taylor, the curate; and the Rev. Dr. Elisha Brooks Joyce (1857–1926), the rector. Christ Church is the oldest Episcopal parish in New Brunswick and the Kilmer family were parishioners. Rector Joyce, who served the parish from 1883 to 1916, baptised the young Kilmer, who remained an Episcopalian until his 1913 conversion to Catholicism. Kilmer&#x27;s birthplace in New Brunswick, where the Kilmer family lived from 1886 to 1892, is still standing and houses a small museum to Kilmer, as well as a few Middlesex County government offices.

Kilmer entered Rutgers College Grammar School (now Rutgers Preparatory School) in 1895 at the age of 8. During his years at the Grammar School, Kilmer was editor-in-chief of the school&#x27;s paper, the &quot;Argo&quot;, and loved the classics but had difficulty with Greek. He won the first Lane Classical Prize, for oratory, and obtained a scholarship to Rutgers College which he would attend the following year. Despite his difficulties with Greek and mathematics, he stood at the head of his class in preparatory school.

After graduating from Rutgers College Grammar School in 1904, he continued his education at Rutgers College (now Rutgers University) from 1904 to 1906. At Rutgers, Kilmer was associate editor of the &quot;Targum&quot;, the campus newspaper, and a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity. However, he was unable to complete the curriculum&#x27;s rigorous mathematics requirement and was asked to repeat his sophomore year. Under pressure from his mother, Kilmer transferred to Columbia University in New York City.

At Columbia, Kilmer was vice-president of the Philolexian Society (a literary society), associate editor of &quot;Columbia Spectator&quot; (the campus newspaper), and member of the Debating Union. He completed his Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) degree and graduated from Columbia on May 23, 1908. Shortly after graduation, on June 9, 1908, he married Aline Murray (1888–1941), a fellow poet to whom he had been engaged since his sophomore year at Rutgers. The Kilmers had five children: Kenton Sinclair Kilmer (1909–1995); Rose Kilburn Kilmer (1912–1917); Deborah Clanton Kilmer (1914–1999), who became a nun (&quot;Sister Michael&quot;) at the Saint Benedict Monastery, St. Joseph, Minnesota; Michael Barry Kilmer (1916–1927); and Christopher Kilmer (1917–1984).

===Years of writing and faith: 1909–1917===

In the autumn of 1908, Kilmer was employed teaching Latin at Morristown High School in Morristown, New Jersey. At this time, he began to submit essays to &quot;Red Cross Notes&quot; (including his first published piece, an essay on the &quot;Psychology of Advertising&quot;) and his early poems to literary periodicals. Kilmer also wrote book reviews for &quot;The Literary Digest&quot;, &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot;, &quot;The Nation&quot;, and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. By June 1909, Kilmer had abandoned any aspirations to continue teaching and relocated to New York City, where he focused solely on developing a career as a writer.

From 1909 to 1912, Kilmer was employed by Funk and Wagnalls, which was preparing an edition of &quot;The Standard Dictionary&quot; that would be published in 1912. According to Hillis, Kilmer&#x27;s job &quot;was to define ordinary words assigned to him at five cents for each word defined. This was a job at which one would ordinarily earn ten to twelve dollars a week, but Kilmer attacked the task with such vigor and speed that it was soon thought wisest to put him on a regular salary.&quot;

In 1911, Kilmer&#x27;s first book of verse was published, entitled &quot;Summer of Love.&quot; Kilmer later wrote, &quot;some of the poems in it, those inspired by genuine love, are not things of which to be ashamed, and you, understanding, would not be offended by the others.&quot;

In 1912, Kilmer became a special writer for the &quot;New York Times Review of Books&quot; and the &quot;New York Times Sunday Magazine&quot; and was often engaged in lecturing. He moved to Mahwah, New Jersey, where he resided until his service and death in World War I. By this time he had become established as a published poet and as a popular lecturer. According to Robert Holliday, Kilmer &quot;frequently neglected to make any preparation for his speeches, not even choosing a subject until the beginning of the dinner which was to culminate in a specimen of his oratory. His constant research for the dictionary, and, later on, for his New York Times articles, must have given him a store of knowledge at his fingertips to be produced at a moment&#x27;s notice for these emergencies.&quot;

When the Kilmers&#x27; daughter Rose (1912–1917) was stricken with poliomyelitis (also known as infantile paralysis) shortly after birth, they turned to their religious faith for comfort. A series of correspondence between Kilmer and Fr. James J. Daly led the Kilmers to convert to Catholicism, and they were received in the church in 1913. In one of these letters, Kilmer writes that he &quot;believed in the Catholic position, the Catholic view of ethics and aesthetics, for a long time,&quot; and he &quot;wanted something not intellectual, some conviction not mental – in fact I wanted Faith.&quot; Kilmer would stop &quot;every morning for months&quot; on his way &quot;to the office and prayed for faith,&quot; claiming that when &quot;faith did come, it came, I think, by way of my little paralyzed daughter. Her lifeless hands led me; I think her tiny feet know beautiful paths. You understand this and it gives me a selfish pleasure to write it down.&quot;

With the publication of &quot;Trees&quot; in the magazine &quot;Poetry&quot; in August 1913, Kilmer gained immense popularity as a poet across the United States. He had established himself as a successful lecturer—particularly one seeking to reach a Catholic audience. His close friend and editor Robert Holliday wrote that it &quot;is not an unsupported assertion to say that he was in his time and place the laureate of the Catholic Church.&quot; &quot;Trees and Other Poems&quot; (1914) was published the following year. This collection also introduced the popular poem &quot;The House With Nobody In It&quot;. Over the next few years, Kilmer was prolific in his output, managing an intense schedule of lectures, publishing a large number of essays and literary criticism, and writing poetry. In 1915 he became poetry editor of &quot;Current Literature&quot; and contributing editor of &quot;Warner&#x27;s Library of the World&#x27;s Best Literature&quot;. In 1916 and 1917, before the American entry into World War I, Kilmer would publish four books: &quot;The Circus and Other Essays&quot; (1916), a series of interviews with literary personages entitled &quot;Literature in the Making&quot; (1917), &quot;Main Street and Other Poems&quot; (1917), and &quot;Dreams and Images: An Anthology of Catholic Poets&quot; (1917). In the aftermath of the 1916 Easter Rising in Ireland, Kilmer helped organize a large memorial service in New Yorks Central Park for those who died in that conflict. 

===War years: 1917–1918===
In April 1917, a few days after the United States entered World War I, Kilmer enlisted in the Seventh Regiment of the New York National Guard. In August, Kilmer was assigned as a statistician with the 165th Infantry Regiment (better known as the re-designated &quot;Fighting 69th&quot;, the 69th New York Infantry Regiment), of the 42nd &quot;Rainbow&quot; Division, and quickly rose to the rank of sergeant. Though he was eligible for commission as an officer and often recommended for such posts during the course of the war, Kilmer refused, stating that he would rather be a sergeant in the Fighting 69th than an officer in any other regiment.

Shortly before his deployment to Europe, the Kilmers&#x27; daughter Rose died, and twelve days later their son Christopher was born. Before his departure, Kilmer had contracted with publishers to write a book about the war, deciding upon the title &quot;Here and There with the Fighting Sixty-Ninth&quot;. The regiment arrived in France in November 1917, and Kilmer wrote to his wife that he had not written &quot;anything in prose or verse since I got here—except statistics—but I&#x27;ve stored up a lot of memories to turn into copy when I get a chance.&quot; Kilmer did not write such a book; however, toward the end of the year, he did find time to write prose sketches and poetry. The most notable of his poems during this period was &quot;Rouge Bouquet&quot; (1918) which commemorated the deaths of two dozen members of his regiment in a German artillery barrage on American trench positions in the Rouge Bouquet forest north-east of the French village of Baccarat. At the time, this was a relatively quiet sector of the front, but the first battalion was struck by a German heavy artillery bombardment on the afternoon of March 7, 1918, that buried 21 men of the unit, killing 19 (of which 14 remained entombed).

Kilmer sought more hazardous duty and was transferred to the military intelligence section of his regiment, in April 1918. In a letter to his wife, Aline, he remarked: &quot;Now I&#x27;m doing work I love – and work you may be proud of. None of the drudgery of soldiering, but a double share of glory and thrills.&quot; According to Hillis, Kilmer&#x27;s fellow soldiers had accorded him much respect for his battlefield demeanour—&quot;He was worshipped by the men about him. I have heard them speak with awe of his coolness and his nerve in scouting patrols in no man&#x27;s land. This coolness and his habit of choosing, with typical enthusiasm, the most dangerous and difficult missions, led to his death.&quot;

===Death and burial===
During the Second Battle of Marne there was heavy fighting throughout the last days of July 1918. On July 30, 1918, Kilmer volunteered to accompany Major &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Donovan (later, in World War II, the founder of the Office of Strategic Services, forerunner to the Central Intelligence Agency) when Donovan&#x27;s battalion (1–165th Infantry) was sent to lead the day&#x27;s attack.

During the course of the day, Kilmer led a scouting party to find the position of a German machine gun. When his comrades found him, some time later, they thought at first that he was peering over the edge of a little hill, where he had crawled for a better view. When he did not answer their call, they ran to him and found him dead. According to Father Francis P. Duffy: &quot;A bullet had pierced his brain. His body was carried in and buried by the side of Ames. God rest his dear and gallant soul.&quot; A sniper&#x27;s bullet likely killed him instantly. According to military records, Kilmer died on the battlefield near Muercy Farm, beside the Ourcq River near the village of Seringes-et-Nesles, in France, on July 30, 1918, at the age of 31. For his valor, Kilmer was posthumously awarded the Croix de Guerre (War Cross) by the French Republic.

Kilmer was buried in the Oise-Aisne American Cemetery and Memorial, near Fere-en-Tardenois, Aisne, Picardy, France just across the road and stream from the farm where he was killed. A cenotaph erected to his memory is located on the Kilmer family plot in Elmwood Cemetery, in North Brunswick, New Jersey. A Memorial Mass was celebrated at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in New York City on October 14, 1918.

===&quot;Trees&quot;===

Joyce Kilmer&#x27;s reputation as a poet is staked largely on the widespread popularity of one poem—&quot;Trees&quot; (1913). It was first published in the August 1913 issue of &quot;Poetry: A Magazine of Verse&quot; which had begun publishing the year before in Chicago, Illinois and was included as the title poem in a collection of poems &quot;Trees and Other Poems&quot; (1914). According to Kilmer&#x27;s oldest son, Kenton, the poem was written on February 2, 1913, when the family resided in Mahwah, New Jersey.

Many locations including Rutgers University (where Kilmer attended for two years), University of Notre Dame, as well as historians in Mahwah, New Jersey and in other places, have boasted that a specific tree was the inspiration for Kilmer&#x27;s poem. However, Kenton Kilmer refutes these claims, remarking that, 

The popular appeal of this simple poem is likely the source of its endurance despite the continuing negative opinion of the poem&#x27;s merits from scholars and critics. According to Robert Holliday, Kilmer&#x27;s friend and editor, &quot;Trees&quot; speaks &quot;with authentic song to the simplest of hearts&quot; and that &quot;(t)he exquisite title poem now so universally known, made his reputation more than all the rest he had written put together. That impeccable lyric which made for immediate widespread popularity.&quot; Its popularity has also led to parodies of the poem—some by noted poets and writers. The pattern of its first lines (&quot;I think that I shall never see / A poem lovely as a tree.&quot;) is of seemingly simple rhyme and meter and easy to mimic along with the poem&#x27;s choice of metaphors. One of the best known parodies is &quot;Song of the Open Road&quot; by American humorist and poet Ogden Nash (1902–1971):

: &quot;I think that I shall never see&quot;
: &quot;A billboard lovely as a tree.&quot;
: &quot;Indeed, unless the billboards fall,&quot;
: &quot;I&#x27;ll never see a tree at all.&quot;

===Influences upon Kilmer&#x27;s verse===
Kilmer&#x27;s early works were inspired by, and were imitative of, the poetry of Algernon Charles Swinburne, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Ernest Dowson, Aubrey Beardsley, and William Butler Yeats (and the Celtic Revival). It was later through the influence of works by Coventry Patmore, Francis Thompson, and those of Alice Meynell and her children Viola Meynell and Francis Meynell, that Kilmer seems to have become interested in Catholicism. Kilmer wrote of his influences:

Because he was initially raised Episcopalian (or Anglican), Kilmer became literary editor of the Anglican weekly, &quot;The Churchman&quot;, before his conversion to Catholicism. During this time he did considerable research into 16th and 17th century Anglican poets as well as metaphysical, or mystic poets of that time, including George Herbert, Thomas Traherne, Robert Herrick, Bishop Coxe, and Robert Stephen Hawker (the eccentric vicar of the Church of Saint Morwenna and Saint John the Baptist at Morwenstow in Cornwall)—the latter whom he referred to as &quot;a coast life-guard in a cassock.&quot; These poets also had an influence on Kilmer&#x27;s writings.

Critics compared Kilmer to British Catholic writers Hilaire Belloc and G. K. Chesterton—suggesting that his reputation might have risen to the level where he would have been considered their American counterpart if not for his untimely death.

===Legacy===
Kilmer&#x27;s death at age 31 denied him the opportunity to develop into a more mature poet. Because modern critics often dismiss &quot;Trees&quot; as simple verse, much of Kilmer&#x27;s work (especially his literary criticism) has slipped into obscurity. Only a very few of his poems have appeared in anthologies, and with the exception of &quot;Trees&quot;—and to a much lesser extent &quot;Rouge Bouquet&quot; (1917–1918)—almost none have obtained lasting widespread popularity.

The entire corpus of Kilmer&#x27;s work was produced between 1909 and 1918 when Romanticism and sentimental lyric poetry fell out of favor and Modernism took root—especially with the influence of the Lost Generation. In the years after Kilmer&#x27;s death, poetry went in drastically different directions, as is seen especially in the work of T. S. Eliot and Ezra Pound. Kilmer&#x27;s verse is conservative and traditional, and does not break the formal rules of poetics—he can be considered as one of the last poets of the Romantic era. His style has been criticized for not breaking free of traditional modes of rhyme, meter, and theme, and for being too sentimental to be taken seriously.

In the 1940 film, &quot;The Fighting 69th&quot;, the role of Sergeant Joyce Kilmer was portrayed by actor Jeffrey Lynn.

<doc id="63174" wikidata="Q2908" url="?curid=63174" title="Antoine de Saint-Exupéry">
<text>Antoine Marie Jean-Baptiste Roger, vicomte de Saint-Exupéry (29 June 1900 – 31 July 1944), known simply as Antoine de Saint-Exupéry (, , ), was a French writer, poet, journalist and aviator.

Saint-Exupéry trained as a commercial pilot in the early decades of 1920s, working airmail routes across Europe, Africa, and South America. Between 1926 and 1939, four of his literary works were published: the short story &quot;The Aviator&quot;, novels &quot;Southern Mail&quot; and &quot;Night Flight&quot;, and the memoir &quot;Wind, Sand and Stars&quot;. Saint-Exupéry joined the French Air Force for World War II and flew reconnaissance missions until France&#x27;s armistice with Germany in 1940. Being demobilised by the Air Force, Saint-Exupéry lived in exile in the United States between 1941 and 1943 and helped persuade it to enter the war. During this time, his works &quot;Flight to Arras&quot; and &quot;The Little Prince&quot; were published. 

Saint-Exupéry joined the Free French Air Force in 1943, despite being past the maximum age as a war pilot and in declining health. During a reconnaissance mission over Corsica on 31 July 1944, Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s plane disappeared: it is presumed to have crashed. Debris from the wreckage was discovered off the coast of Marseille in 2000, but the cause of the crash remains unknown.

==Youth and aviation==
Saint-Exupéry was born in Lyon, into the French aristocratic Catholic family that traced its lineage back several centuries. Their surname references the 5th-century bishop Saint Exuperius. He was the third child of Viscount Jean de Saint-Exupéry (1863–1904) and his wife, Marie Boyer de Fonscolombe (1875-1972). His father, an executive of the &quot;Le Soleil&quot; (The Sun) insurance brokerage, died of a stroke in the train station of La Foux before Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s 4th birthday. His father&#x27;s death affected the entire family, transforming their status to that of &quot;impoverished aristocrats&quot;.

Saint-Exupéry had three sisters and a younger brother, François, who died at age 15 of rheumatic fever contracted while both were attending the Marianist College Villa St. Jean in Fribourg, Switzerland, during World War I. Saint-Exupéry attended to his brother, who he claimed was his closest confidant, beside his death bed, and later wrote that François &quot;remained motionless for an instant. He did not cry out. He fell as gently as a [young] tree falls&quot;, imagery later recrafted into the climactic ending of &quot;The Little Prince&quot;. At the age of 17, now the only male in the family following the death of his brother, Saint-Exupéry soon assumed the role of a protector and took to consoling his family, despite still being distraught over his father&#x27;s death.

After twice failing his final exams at a preparatory Naval Academy, Saint-Exupéry entered the École des Beaux-Arts as an auditor to study architecture for 15 months, again without graduating, and then fell into the habit of accepting odd jobs. In 1921, Saint-Exupéry began his military service as a basic-rank soldier with the &quot;2e Régiment de chasseurs à cheval&quot; (2nd Chasseurs à Cheval Regiment) and was sent to Neuhof, near Strasbourg. While there, he took private flying lessons and the following year was offered a transfer from the French Army to the French Air Force. He received his pilot&#x27;s wings after being posted to the 37th Fighter Regiment in Casablanca, Morocco.

Later, Saint-Exupéry was reposted to the 34th Aviation Regiment at Le Bourget on the outskirts of Paris, and then experienced the first of his many aircraft crashes. Saint-Exupéry, influenced by the urgings of the family of his fiancée, future novelist Louise Lévêque de Vilmorin, subsequently left the air force to take an office job. The couple ultimately broke off their engagement and he worked at several more odd jobs over the next few years.

By 1926, Saint-Exupéry was flying again. He became one of the pioneers of international postal flight, in the days when aircraft had few instruments. Later, he complained that those who flew the more advanced aircraft had become more like accountants than pilots. He worked for Aéropostale between Toulouse and Dakar, and then also became the airline stopover manager for the Cape Juby airfield in the Spanish zone of South Morocco, in the Sahara. His duties included negotiating the safe release of downed fliers taken hostage by Saharan tribes, a perilous task that earned him his first Légion d&#x27;honneur from the French Government in 1939.

In 1929, Saint-Exupéry was transferred to Argentina, where he was appointed director of the Aeroposta Argentina airline. He lived in Buenos Aires, in the Galería Güemes building. He surveyed new air routes across South America, negotiated agreements, and occasionally flew the airmail as well as search missions looking for downed fliers. This period of his life is briefly explored in &quot;Wings of Courage&quot;, an IMAX film by French director Jean-Jacques Annaud.

==Writing career==

Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s first novella, &quot;L&#x27;Aviateur&quot; (&quot;The Aviator&quot;), was published in 1926 in a short-lived literary magazine, &quot;Le Navire d&#x27;Argent&quot; (&quot;The Silver Ship&quot;). In 1929, his first book, &quot;Courrier Sud&quot; (&quot;Southern Mail&quot;) was published. It chronicled his time flying the Casablanca-Dakar mail route.

The 1931 publication of &quot;Night Flight&quot; established Saint-Exupéry as a rising star in the literary world. It was the first of his major works to gain widespread acclaim, and it won the prix Femina. The novel mirrored his experiences as a mail pilot and director of the Aeroposta Argentina. 

That same year, at Grasse, Saint-Exupéry married Consuelo Suncin (née Suncín Sandoval), a once-divorced, once-widowed Salvadoran writer and artist, who Saint-Exupéry described as having possessed a bohemian spirit and a &quot;viper&#x27;s tongue&quot;.

Saint-Exupéry left and returned to his wife many times—he saw her as both his muse, but, over the long term, the source of much of his angst. The relationship has been described as &#x27;rocky&#x27;, with Saint-Exupéry travelling frequently and indulging in numerous affairs, most notably with the Frenchwoman Hélène de Vogüé (1908–2003), known as &quot;Nelly&quot; and referred to as &quot;Madame de B.&quot; in Saint-Exupéry biographies. Vogüé became Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s literary executrix after his death and also wrote her own Saint-Exupéry biography under a pseudonym, Pierre Chevrier.

Saint-Exupéry continued to write until the spring of 1943 when he left the United States with American troops bound for North Africa in the Second World War.

==Canadian and American sojourn and &quot;The Little Prince&quot;==

Following the German invasion of France in 1940, Saint-Exupéry flew a Bloch MB.174 with the &quot;Groupe de reconnaissance II/33&quot; reconnaissance squadron of the Armée de l&#x27;Air.

After France&#x27;s armistice with Germany, Saint-Exupéry went into exile in North America, escaping through Portugal. He stayed in Estoril, at the Hotel Palácio, between 28 November and 20 December 1940. He described his impressions of his stay in Lettre à un Otage. On the same day that he checked out, he boarded the &quot;S.S. Siboney&quot; and arrived in New York City on the last day of 1940, with the intention of convincing the US to enter the conflict against Nazi Germany quickly. On 14 January 1941, at a Hotel Astor author luncheon attended by approximately 1,500, he belatedly received his National Book Award for &quot;Wind, Sand and Stars&quot;, won a year earlier while he was occupied witnessing the destruction of the French Army. Consuelo followed him to New York City several months later after a chaotic migration to the southern French town of Oppède, where she lived in an artist&#x27;s commune, the basis of her autobiography, &quot;Kingdom of the Rocks: Memories of Oppède&quot;.

Between January 1941 and April 1943, the Saint-Exupérys lived in New York City&#x27;s Central Park South in twin penthouse apartments, as well as The Bevin House mansion in Asharoken on Long Island, New York and a townhouse on Beekman Place in Manhattan.

Saint-Exupéry and Charles Lindbergh both became P-38 pilots during World War II, with Lindbergh fighting in the Pacific War, and Saint-Exupéry fighting over the Mediterranean, where he later died.

Saint-Exupéry added the hyphen to his surname after his arrival in the United States, saying that he was annoyed with Americans addressing him as &quot;Mr. Exupéry&quot;. During this period, he authored &quot;Pilote de guerre (Flight to Arras)&quot;, which earned widespread acclaim, and &quot;Lettre à un otage&quot; (&quot;Letter to a Hostage&quot;), dedicated to the 40 million French living under Nazi oppression, in addition to numerous shorter pieces in support of France. The Saint-Exupérys also resided in Quebec City, Canada for several weeks during the late spring of 1942. During their time in Quebec City, the family lived with the philosopher Charles De Koninck and his family, including his &quot;precocious&quot; 8-year-old son, Thomas.

After he returned from his stay in Québec, which had been fraught with illness and stress, the wife of one of his publishers helped persuade Saint-Exupéry to produce a children&#x27;s book, hoping to calm his nerves and also compete with the new series of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; stories by P.L. Travers. Saint-Exupéry wrote and illustrated &quot;The Little Prince&quot; in New York City and the village of Asharoken in mid-to-late 1942, with the manuscript being completed in October. It was published in early 1943 in both English and French in the United States, and only later appeared in France, posthumously, after the liberation of France, as his works had been banned by the collaborationist Vichy Regime. &quot;The Little Prince&quot; is dedicated to Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s close friend Léon Werth.

==Return to war==
In April 1943, following his 27 months in North America, Saint-Exupéry departed with an American military convoy for Algiers, to fly with the Free French Air Force and fight with the Allies in a Mediterranean-based squadron. Then 43, soon to be promoted to the rank of commandant (major), he was far older than most men in operational units. Although eight years over the age limit for such pilots, he had petitioned endlessly for an exemption which had finally been approved by General Dwight Eisenhower. However, Saint-Exupéry had been suffering pain and immobility due to his many previous crash injuries, to the extent that he could not dress himself in his own flight suit or even turn his head leftwards to check for enemy aircraft.

Saint-Exupéry was assigned with a number of other pilots to his former unit, renamed &quot;Groupe de reconnaissance 2/33 &quot;Savoie&quot;&quot;, flying P-38 Lightnings, which an officer described as &quot;war-weary, non-airworthy craft&quot;. The Lightnings were also more sophisticated than models he previously flew, requiring him to undertake seven weeks of stringent training before his first mission. After wrecking a P-38 through engine failure on his second mission, he was grounded for eight months, but was then later reinstated to flight duty on the personal intervention of General Ira Eaker, Deputy Commander of the U.S. Army Air Forces.

After Saint-Exupéry resumed flying, he also returned to his longtime habit of reading and writing while flying his single-seat Lockheed F-5B (a specially configured P-38 reconnaissance variant). His prodigious studies of literature gripped him and on occasion, he continued his readings of literary works until moments before takeoff, with mechanics having warmed up and tested his aircraft for him in preparation for his flight. On one flight, to the chagrin of his colleagues awaiting his arrival, he circled the airport for an hour after returning, so that he could finish reading a novel. Saint-Exupéry frequently flew with a lined notebook (&quot;carnet&quot;) during his long solitary flights and some of his philosophical writings were created during such periods when he could reflect on the world below him.

==Disappearance==
Before his return to flight duty with his squadron in North Africa, the collaborationist Vichy Regime unilaterally promoted Saint-Exupéry as one of its members. Saint-Exupéry was shocked and dismayed by this, in keeping with his historical harsh criticism of the Vichy Regime. Subsequently, French General (later French President) Charles de Gaulle, whom Saint-Exupéry held in low regard, made a public statement that implied that Saint-Exupéry was supporting Germany. Saint-Exupéry became depressed by these events and began to consume alcohol heavily. His physical and mental health began deteriorating. Saint-Exupéry was said, by his peers in the air force, to be intermittently subject to depression, and there was discussion about grounding him.

Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s last reconnaissance mission was to collect intelligence on German troop movements in and around the Rhone Valley preceding Operation Dragoon, the Allied invasion of southern France. Although he had been reinstated to his old squadron with the provision that he was to fly only five missions, on 31 July 1944, he took off in an unarmed P-38 on his ninth reconnaissance mission from an airbase on Corsica. To the great alarm of his squadron compatriots, he did not return, vanishing without a trace. Word of his disappearance soon spread across the literary world and then it spread into international headlines.

===Discovery at sea===

In September 1998, to the east of Riou Island (south of Marseille), a fisherman found a silver identity bracelet bearing the names of Saint-Exupéry, his wife Consuelo, and his American publisher, Reynal &amp; Hitchcock. The bracelet was hooked to a piece of fabric, presumably from his flight suit. Announcement of the discovery was an emotional event in France, where Saint-Exupéry was a national icon, and some disputed its authenticity because it was found far from his intended flight path, implying that the aircraft might not have been shot down.

In May 2000, a diver found debris from a Lockheed P-38 Lightning submerged off the coast of Marseille, near where the bracelet was found. The discovery galvanized the country, which had conducted searches for his aircraft and speculated on Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s fate for decades. After a two-year delay imposed by the French government, the remnants of the aircraft were recovered in October 2003. In 2004, French officials and investigators from the French Underwater Archaeological Department officially confirmed that the wreckage was from Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s aircraft.

No marks or holes attributable to gunfire were found, but that was not considered significant as only a small portion of the aircraft was recovered. In June 2004, the fragments were given to the &quot;Musée de l&#x27;Air et de l&#x27;Espace&quot; (Air and Space Museum) in Le Bourget, Paris, where Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s life is commemorated in a special exhibit.

===Speculations in 1948, 1972 and 2008===
In 1948, former Luftwaffe telegrapher Rev. Hermann Korth published his war logs, noting an incident that occurred at around noon on 31 July 1944 in which a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 shot down a P-38 Lightning. Korth&#x27;s account ostensibly supported a shoot-down hypothesis for Saint-Exupéry. The veracity of his log was met with skepticism, because it could have described a P-38 which was flown by Second Lieutenant Gene Meredith on 30 July, shot down south of Nice.

In 1972, the German magazine &quot;Der Landser&quot; quoted a letter from Luftwaffe reconnaissance pilot Robert Heichele, in which he purportedly claimed to have shot down a P-38 on 31 July 1944. His account, corroborated by a spotter, seemingly supported a shoot-down hypothesis of Saint-Exupéry. Heichele&#x27;s account was met with skepticism because he described flying a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 D-9, a variant which had not yet entered Luftwaffe service.

In the lists which are held by the &quot;Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv&quot;, no victory was credited to Heichele or his unit in either July or August 1944, and the decrypted report of the day&#x27;s reconnaissance does not include any flights by 2./NAG 13&#x27;s Fw 190s. Heichele was shot down on 16 August 1944 and died five days later.

In 2008, a French journalist from &quot;La Provence&quot;, who was investigating Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s death, contacted former Luftwaffe pilots who flew in the area of Marseille, eventually getting an account from Horst Rippert (1922–2013). Rippert was the older brother of the famous bass singer Ivan Rebroff, who was born in Berlin as Hans-Rolf Rippert. In his memoirs, Horst Rippert, an admirer of Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s books, expressed both fears and doubts that he was responsible, but in 2003 he stated that he became certain that he was responsible when he learned the location of Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s wreckage. Rippert claimed to have reported the kill over his radio, but there are no surviving records to verify this account.

Rippert&#x27;s account, as it is discussed in two French and German books, was met with both publicity and skepticism. Luftwaffe comrades expressed doubts in Rippert&#x27;s claim, given that he held it private for 64 years. Very little German documentation survived the war, and contemporary archival sources, consisting mostly of Allied intercepts of Luftwaffe signals, offer no evidence to verify Rippert&#x27;s claim. The entry and exit points of Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s mission were likely near Cannes, yet his wreckage was discovered south of Marseille.

Though it is possible that German fighters could have intercepted, or at least altered, Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s flight path, the cause of his death remains unknown, and Rippert&#x27;s account remains one hypothesis among many.

==Literary works==
While not precisely autobiographical, much of Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s work is inspired by his experiences as a pilot. One notable example is his novella, &quot;The Little Prince,&quot; a poetic tale self-illustrated in watercolours in which a pilot stranded in the desert meets a young prince fallen to Earth from a tiny asteroid. &quot;His most popular work, &quot;The Little Prince&quot; was partially based upon a crash he and his navigator survived in the Libyan desert. They were stranded and dehydrated for four days, nearing death when they miraculously stumbled upon a Bedouin who gave them water.&quot; Saint-Exupéry wrote in &quot;Wind, Sand and Stars&quot; that the Bedouin saved their lives and gave them &quot;charity and magnanimity [by] bearing the gift of water.&quot; &quot;The Little Prince&quot; is a philosophical story, including societal criticism, remarking on the strangeness of the adult world. One biographer wrote of his most famous work: &quot;Rarely have an author and a character been so intimately bound together as Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and his Little Prince,&quot; and remarking of their dual fates, &quot;...the two remain tangled together, twin innocents who fell from the sky.&quot;

===Other works===
During the 1930s, Saint-Exupéry led a mixed life as an aviator, journalist, author and publicist for Air France, Aéropostale&#x27;s successor. His journalistic writings for &quot;Paris-Soir&quot;, &quot;Marianne&quot; and other newspapers covered events in Indochina and the Far East (1934), the Mediterranean, Soviet Union and Moscow (1935), and the Spanish Civil War (1936–1937). Saint-Exupéry wrote a number of shorter pieces, essays and commentaries for various newspapers and magazines.

Notable among those during World War II was &quot;An Open Letter to Frenchmen Everywhere&quot;, which was highly controversial in its attempt to rally support for France against Nazi oppression at a time when the French were sharply divided between support of the Gaullists and Vichy factions. It was published in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; in November 1942, in its original French in &quot;Le Canada, de Montréal&quot; at the same time, and in &quot;Pour la Victoire&quot; the following month. Other shorter pieces include (in French except where translated by others to English):

* Preface of &quot;Destin de Le Brix&quot; by José le Boucher, Nouvelle Librairie Française, 1932.
* Preface of &quot;Grandeur et servitude de l&#x27;aviation&quot; by Maurice Bourdet, Paris: Editions Corrêa, 1933.

===Censorship and publication bans===
&quot;Pilote de guerre&quot; (&quot;Flight To Arras&quot;), which describes the German invasion of France, was slightly censored when it was released in its original French during wartime by Éditions Gallimard in his homeland in 1942, due to the removal of a derogatory remark which was made about Hitler (which Gallimard failed to reinsert in subsequent editions after World War II). Shortly after the book&#x27;s wartime release in France, Nazi appeasers and Vichy supporters objected to its praise of one of Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s squadron colleagues, Captain Jean Israël, who was portrayed as being amongst the squadron&#x27;s bravest defenders during the Battle of France.

In support of their German occupiers and masters, Vichy authorities attacked the author as a defender of Jews (in racist terms) leading to the praised book being banned in France, along with prohibitions against further printings of Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s other works. Prior to France&#x27;s liberation new printings of Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s works were made available there only by means of covert print runs, such as that of February 1943 when 1,000 copies of an underground version of &quot;Pilote de guerre&quot; were printed in Lyon.

A further complication occurred due to Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s and others&#x27; view of General Charles de Gaulle, who was held in low regard. Early in the war, de Gaulle became the leader of the Free French Forces in exile, with his headquarters in London. Even though both men were working to free France from Nazi occupation, Saint-Exupéry viewed de Gaulle with apprehension as a possible post-war dictator, and he consequently provided no public support to the General. De Gaulle retaliated by implying that the author was a supporter of Germany, and he then had his literary works banned in France&#x27;s North African colonies. Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s writings were, with irony, banned simultaneously in occupied France and the territory which was controlled by Free France.

===Extension of copyrights in France===
Due to Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s wartime death, the French government awarded his estate the civil code designation &quot;Mort pour la France&quot; (English: &quot;Died for France&quot;) in 1948. Amongst the law&#x27;s provisions is an increase of 30 years to the duration of the original copyright&#x27;s duration of 70 years; thus most of Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s creative works will not fall out of copyright status in France for an extra 30 years.

==Honours and legacy==

* Saint-Exupéry is commemorated with an inscription in the Panthéon in Paris, France&#x27;s repository of historical greats. Although his body was never identified, his name was added to the Panthéon in November 1967 by a French legislative act. The inscription reads: &quot;A LA MEMOIRE DE • ANTOINE DE SAINT EXUPERY • POETE ROMANCIER AVIATEUR • DISPARU AU COURS D&#x27;UNE MISSION • DE RECONNAISSANCE AERIENNE • LE 31 JUILLET 1944&quot; (To the memory of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, poet, novelist, aviator, missing during an aerial reconnaissance mission, 31 July 1944). Amongst other honours from France, he was named a in April 1930 and was promoted to in January 1939. He was awarded the in 1940 and was posthumously awarded the in 1944.
* From 1993 until the introduction of the euro, Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s portrait and several of his drawings from &quot;The Little Prince&quot; appeared on France&#x27;s 50-franc banknote. The French Government also later minted a 100-franc commemorative coin, with Saint-Exupéry on its obverse side, and the Little Prince on its reverse. Brass-plated souvenir &quot;Monnaie de Paris&quot; commemorative medallions were also created in his honour, depicting the pilot&#x27;s portrait over the P-38 Lightning aircraft he last flew.
* In 1999, the Government of Quebec and Quebec City added a historical marker to the family home of Charles De Koninck, head of the Department of Philosophy at Université Laval, where the Saint-Exupérys stayed while lecturing in Canada for several weeks during May and June 1942.
* In 2000, on the centenary of his birth, in the city where he was born, he was memorialised when the Lyon Satolas Airport was renamed the Lyon-Saint Exupéry Airport. Lyon&#x27;s TGV bullet train station was also renamed Gare de Lyon Saint-Exupéry. The author is additionally commemorated by a statue in Lyon, depicting a seated Saint-Exupéry with the little prince standing behind him.
* A street in Montesson, a suburb of Paris, is named after him as Rue Antoine de Saint-Exupéry.

===Museums and exhibits===


Museum exhibits, exhibitions and theme villages dedicated to both him and his diminutive Little Prince have been created in Le Bourget, Paris and other locations in France, as well as in the Republic of South Korea, Japan, Morocco, Brazil, the United States and Canada:
* The Air and Space Museum at Paris&#x27;s Le Bourget Airport, in cooperation with The Estate of Saint-Exupéry-d&#x27;Agay, has created a permanent exhibit of 300 m2 dedicated to the author, pilot, person and humanist. The &quot;Espace Saint-Exupéry&quot; exhibit, officially inaugurated in 2006 on the anniversary of the aviator&#x27;s birthday, traces each stage of his life as an airmail pioneer, eclectic intellectual artist, and military pilot. It includes artefacts from his life: photographs, his drawings, letters, some of his original notebooks (&quot;carnets&quot;) he scribbled in voluminously and which were later published posthumously, plus remnants of the unarmed P-38 he flew on his last reconnaissance mission and which were recovered from the Mediterranean Sea.
* In Tarfaya, Morocco, next to the Cape Juby airfield where Saint-Exupéry was based as an Aéropostale airmail pilot/station manager, Antoine de Saint-Exupery Museum was created honouring both him and the company. A small monument at the airfield is also dedicated to them.
* In Gyeonggi-do, South Korea, and Hakone, Japan, theme village museums have been created honouring Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s &quot;Little Prince&quot;.
* In January 1995, the Alberta Aviation Museum of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, in conjunction with the cultural organization Alliance française, presented a showing of Saint-Exupéry letters, watercolours, sketches and photographs.
* In São Paulo, Brazil, through 2009, the Oca Art Exhibition Centre presented Saint-Exupéry and The Little Prince as part of The Year of France and The Little Prince. The displays covered over 10,000 m2 on four floors, and chronicled Saint-Exupéry, &quot;The Little Prince&quot; and their philosophies, as visitors passed through theme areas of the desert, asteroids, stars, and the cosmos. The ground floor of the giant exhibition was laid out as a huge map of the routes flown by the author with Aeropostale in South America and around the world. Also included was a full-scale replica of the author&#x27;s crashed Caudron Simoun, lying wrecked on the ground of a simulated Libyan desert following his disastrous Paris-Saigon race attempt. The miraculous survival of Saint-Exupéry and his mechanic/navigator was subsequently chronicled in the award-winning memoir &quot;Wind, Sand and Stars&quot; (&quot;Terre des hommes&quot;), and also formed the introduction of his most famous work &quot;The Little Prince&quot; (&quot;Le Petit Prince&quot;).
* In 2011, the City of Toulouse, France, home of Airbus and the pioneering airmail carrier Aéropostale, in conjunction with the Estate of Saint-Exupéry-d&#x27;Agay and the Youth Foundation of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, hosted a major exposition on Saint-Exupéry and his experience with Aéropostale. The exposition, titled &quot;L&#x27;année Antoine de Saint-Exupéry à Toulouse&quot;, exhibited selected personal artefacts of the author-aviator, including gloves, photos, posters, maps, manuscripts, drawings, models of the aircraft he flew, some of the wreckage from his Sahara Desert plane crash, and the personal silver identification bracelet engraved with his and Consuelo&#x27;s name, presented by his U.S. publisher, which was recovered from his last, ultimate crash site in the Mediterranean Sea.
* A number of other prominent exhibitions were created in France and the United States, many of them in 2000, honouring the centenary of the author-aviator&#x27;s birth.
* In January 2014, New York City&#x27;s Morgan Library &amp; Museum featured a major three-month-long exhibition, &quot;The Little Prince: A New York Story&quot;. Celebrating the 70th anniversary year of the novella&#x27;s publication, its exhibits included many of Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s original manuscript pages, his story&#x27;s preliminary drawings and watercolor paintings, and also examined Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s creative writing processes.

===International===
* Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s 1939 memoir &quot;Terre des hommes&quot; (titled as &quot;Wind, Sand and Stars&quot; in English) was chosen to create the central theme (&quot;Terre des Hommes–Man and His World&quot;) of the 1967 International and Universal Exposition in Montreal, Quebec, Canada (Expo &#x27;67), the most successful world&#x27;s fair of the 20th century. The central theme, which also generated the 17 subsidiary elements used for the world&#x27;s fair, was elucidated at a 1963 Montebello, Quebec, conference held with some of Canada&#x27;s leading thinkers. At Montebello, French-Canadian author Gabrielle Roy helped choose the central theme by quoting Saint-Exupéry on mankind&#x27;s place in the universe:

: Additionally, Michèle Lalonde and André Prévost&#x27;s oratorio &quot;Terre des hommes&quot;, performed at the &quot;Place des Nations&quot; opening ceremonies and attended by the international delegates of the participating countries, strongly projected the French writer&#x27;s &#x27;idealist rhetoric&#x27;. Consuelo de Saint-Exupéry (1901–1979), his widow, was also a guest of honour at the opening ceremonies of the World&#x27;s Fair.
* Asteroid 2578 Saint-Exupéry, discovered in November 1975 by Russian astronomer Tamara Smirnova and provisionally cataloged as Asteroid 1975 VW3, was renamed in the author-aviator&#x27;s honour. Another asteroid was named as 46610 Bésixdouze (translated to and from both hexadecimal and French as &#x27;B612&#x27;). Additionally the terrestrial-asteroid protection organization B612 Foundation was named in tribute to the author&#x27;s &quot;Little Prince&quot;, who fell to Earth from Asteroid B-612.
* Philatelic tributes have been printed in at least 25 other countries . Only three years after his death, the pilot-aviator was first featured on an 8 franc French West Africa airmail stamp (Scott Catalog # C11). France followed several months later in 1948 with an 80 franc airmail stamp honouring him (CB1), and later with another stamp honouring both him and airmail pioneer Jean Mermoz, plus the supersonic Concorde passenger airliner, in 1970 (C43). In commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the writer&#x27;s death, Israel issued a stamp honouring &quot;Saint-Ex&quot; and &quot;The Little Prince&quot; in 1994.
* In Argentina and Brazil, where Saint-Exupéry became the founding director of the pioneering South American airmail airline Aeroposta Argentina:
** the Aguja Saint Exupery is a mountain peak located near the Cerro Chaltén (also known as Monte Fitz Roy) in the Los Glaciares National Park in Patagonia, Argentina, The mountain peak is named in Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s honour;
** the San Antonio Oeste municipal airport was named Aerodromo Saint Exupery. A small museum exhibit resides in the airport building;
** the small Brazilian airport serving Ocauçu, São Paulo is named after the pilot, and
** several Argentinian schools are also named after the author-aviator.
The main street of the town of Campeche on the Ilha da Santa Catarina (where Florianopolis the capital of the state is also situated), is named avenida principe pequeno because of his connection to the region.

===Institutions and schools===
* In 1960 the humanitarian organization &quot;Terre des hommes&quot;, named after Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s 1939 philosophical memoir &quot;Terre des hommes&quot; (titled as &quot;Wind, Sand and Stars&quot; in English), was founded in Lausanne, Switzerland by Edmond Kaiser. Other &quot;Terre des Hommes&quot; societies were later organized in more countries with similar social aid and humanitarian goals. The several independent groups joined to form a new umbrella organization, &quot;Terre des Hommes-Fédération Internationale&quot; (TDHFI, in English: International Federation of Terre des Hommes, or IFTDH). The national constituents first met in 1966 to formalize their new parent organization, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. eleven organizations in Canada, Denmark, Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland, and Syria belonged to the Federation. An important part of their works is their consulting role to the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).
* In June 2009, the Antoine de Saint-Exupéry Youth Foundation (FASEJ) was founded in Paris by the Saint-Exupéry–d&#x27;Agay Estate, to promote education, art, culture, health and sports for youth worldwide, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. This organization, which follows Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s philosophies and his memory, was financed in part by the sale of one of his original 1936 handwritten manuscripts at a Sotheby&#x27;s auction for €312,750.
* Numerous public schools, lycées, high schools, colleges and technical schools have been named in honour of Saint-Exupéry across France, Europe, Québec and South America, as well as at least two in Africa. The &quot;École Antoine de Saint-Exupéry de Kigali&quot;, a French international school in Rwanda, is named after him, as is École Francaise Antoine de Saint-Exupéry in Saint Louis, Senegal

<text>The Christian Union ( ; CU) is a Christian democratic political party in the Netherlands. The CU is a centrist party, maintaining more progressive stances on economic, immigration and environmental issues while holding more socially conservative positions on issues such as abortion and euthanasia. The party describes itself as &quot;social Christian&quot;.

The CU was founded in 2000 as a merger of the Reformed Political League (GPV) and Reformatory Political Federation (RPF). After doubling its seat tally in the 2006 Dutch general election, it became the smallest member of the fourth Balkenende cabinet, and since that time has been likewise part of the third Rutte cabinet and the fourth Rutte cabinet. In some elections it forms an alliance with the Calvinist Reformed Political Party (SGP), which, unlike the CU, is a testimonial party.

Primarily a Protestant party, the CU bases its policies on the Bible, and takes the theological principles of charity and stewardship as bases for its support for public expenditure and environmentalism. It seeks for government to uphold Christian morality, but supports freedom of religion under the doctrine of sphere sovereignty. The party is moderately Eurosceptic; it was formerly in the European Parliament with the European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR) and European People&#x27;s Party group (EPP). It is a member of the European Christian Political Movement.

==History==

===Precursors===

Along with the larger Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP), the Netherlands has a long tradition of small orthodox or conservative Protestant (i.e., mostly Reformed) parties in parliament, including the Reformed Political Party (SGP), founded in 1918. After a group of Reformed Churches members formed the Reformed Churches (Liberated) over a religious disagreement, the Reformed Political Alliance (GPV) split off from the ARP in 1948. It took until 1963 for the party to enter parliament. In the 1981 election, the Reformatory Political Federation (RPF) entered parliament. It had split off from the ARP six years earlier over the formation of the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA).
The RPF explicitly stated in its manifesto of principles that it sought to unite all reformed parties in the Netherlands. However, the GPV and SGP were somewhat less receptive. The GPV was only open to a specific current in reformed Protestantism, namely the Reformed Churches (Liberated), and did not wish to cooperate with non-&#x27;liberated&#x27; reformed: it had rejected on religious grounds the entry of the group that in the 1970s was to become the RPF. The SGP had rejected cooperation with these parties because they had female members; the SGP consistently rejected female suffrage until 2006. The RPF, GPV and SGP were testimonial parties, which chose to voice their concerns about government policy, while acknowledging that they were not big enough to force their opinion upon others.

In 1984, however, the three parties cooperated in the European election and presented a common list in order to enter the European Parliament. In the 1989 general election they formed an electoral alliance in order to enhance their chances of obtaining seats. In 1995 informal talks were opened between the three parties. The GPV had opened itself to non-liberated members, but the SGP not to women. The discussions with the SGP were broken off and the GPV and RPF continued together. For a long time the GPV was not willing to enter a major internal debate with the RPF, which also performed better electorally; it had won three seats in the 1998 election, while the GPV received only two. From 1998 the two parliamentary parties cooperated with each other, held common meetings and appointed common spokespersons. In 1999 a group called &quot;Transformatie&quot; (Transformation) was set up by young people from both parties in reaction to the slow cooperation process: they tried to intensify the debate about cooperation. In the same year the cooperation talks were formalised and intensified, leading to the foundation of the Christian Union.

=== Establishment ===

The Christian Union was founded in January 2000 as an alliance between the RPF and GPV. Later in that year, their youth organisations, GPJC and RPFJ, fused completely, presenting an example to their mother organisations. In 2001, they formed a common parliamentary party in both the House of Representatives and Senate. In 2002 the alliance entered the election for the first time. The party obtained four seats, one seat less than in the 1998 election when they campaigned separately. It had polled much better, with some polling stations predicting seven or eight seats. The party&#x27;s leader Kars Veling stepped down. He had been good at keeping the peace internally in a party still somewhat divided between the old GPV and RPF memberships, but had not appealed well enough to the population at large. With preference votes a woman, Tineke Huizinga (positioned seventh on the CU candidate list) was elected into parliament for the CU, becoming the first woman to enter parliament for the party or its predecessors. Because of her election, prominent party figure Eimert van Middelkoop, who was no. 4 on the candidate-list, had to leave parliament.

In the 2003 general election the party lost an additional seat, and was left with three seats. Again Huizinga (now no. 4 on the list) was elected with preference votes and this time former RPF leader Leen van Dijke (no. 3) had to leave parliament. The decline of the CU in 2003 was probably due to party supporters voting for the Christian democratic CDA, which was competing with the social democratic Labour Party (PvdA), to become the largest party. The Christian Union was heavily involved in the formation of the second cabinet Balkenende, along with the SGP. However, the liberal People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) vetoed the formation of a cabinet that included the two conservative Reformed parties, and so the progressive liberal D66 became a part of the governing alliance instead. In 2004 the two organisations RPF and GPV officially ceased to exist, making final the fusion into the CU.

=== Cabinet participation ===
In the 2006 election the party doubled its seat count and joined the fourth Balkenende cabinet. CU leader André Rouvoet became Deputy Prime Minister and minister without portfolio for family and youth, while Middelkoop became Minister of Defence and Huizinga junior minister (&quot;staatssecretaris&quot;) of Transport and Water management. Since the party has entered government, there has been some controversy about the conservative Christian ethical views of some of its members. In 2007 Yvette Lont, a CU municipal council member for Amsterdam, expressed the view that homosexuals should not be admitted to representative functions within the party. Also in 2007, municipal council member Monique Heger decided to resign from office, because she had recently discovered that she was a lesbian, and she and her (female) partner moved in together.

After the collapse of the Balkenende cabinet, the Christian Union no longer had representatives in government; Rouvoet returned to parliament as leader of the CU parliamentary group until he left politics in April/May 2011. Arie Slob succeeded him as the party leader.

In October 2013, the second Rutte cabinet (VVD and PvdA), lacking a majority in the Senate, reached a budgetary agreement with the CU, the Reformed Political Party (SGP) and the Democrats 66 (D66). This occasional coalition was nicknamed &quot;purple with the Bible&quot; (&quot;Paars met de Bijbel&quot;) as it included the secular parties VVD, PvdA and D66 plus the religiously-oriented parties Christian Union and SGP. The term &quot;purple with the Bible&quot; had already been used in February that year, when the same parties reached an agreement on modernising the housing market. Although the cabinet was quite unpopular and the VVD and PvdA lost many municipal seats during the municipal elections of 19 March 2014, the parties that provided tactical support to the government won many seats.

After the 2017 general election, the Christian Union became part of the third Rutte cabinet, as a minor coalition partner to the VVD, CDA and D66. The party has three representatives in the current cabinet: minister Carola Schouten for the Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality, Arie Slob, Minister for Primary Education, Secondary Education and Media and Paul Blokhuis, State Secretary for Health, Welfare and Sports.

Following the 2019 European Parliament election, the Christian Union left the European Conservatives and Reformists Group in the European Parliament (of which it had been a founding member) arguing that the ECR was moving too far to the right by including MEPs of far-right parties such as the Dutch Forum for Democracy and the Sweden Democrats. The party instead joined the European People&#x27;s Party Group.

In January 2023, Mirjam Bikker succeeded Segers as the party leader. During the 2023 Dutch general election the Christian Union lost two of their five seats, getting 2% of the votes.

==Ideology==
The CU describes itself as a Christian social party. The party has its roots in orthodox Protestant (i.e. mostly Reformed) parties, often referred to as the &quot;small right&quot;. It combines a conservative point of view on ethical and foreign policy issues, with more centre-left ideas on economic, asylum, social and environmental issues. Its conservative reformed ideals are reflected in its program of principles. It believes that the state is the swordmaiden of God. It bases its politics directly on the Bible. However, it sees separate duties for the state and the church in public life: the church should spread the Word of God, while the state should merely uphold public morality. The state should respect the religion of its citizens. Other Christian principles, like neighbourly love and stewardship for the Earth, however have given the CU&#x27;s political program a centre-left orientation.

Some of CU&#x27;s socially conservative policies include:
* Facilitation by government of a one-earner model, allowing one parent, usually the wife, to stay at home and take care of the children.
* Society should cherish its collective moments of rest, and preferably leave Sunday a day of rest.
* Abortion and euthanasia-practices should be reduced and eventually replaced by alternatives, such as care of women with unwanted pregnancies and palliative care.
* The Dutch policy of toleration of soft drugs should be abandoned.
* Combatting child pornography and prostitution.
* Defending the freedom of education (that is, to found religious schools), because of sphere sovereignty.
* The Netherlands should remain an independent political entity within the European Union.
* Limiting the use of genetic manipulation.

More centre-left policies include:
* Public services of education, health care and social security should remain state run, but on a smaller scale than is presently the case.
* Increased budgets for development cooperation in order to address the poverty in the global south.
* A more open policy towards asylum seekers, especially those who are persecuted for religious reasons.
* A green environmental policy. Based on its electoral promises on investment in green energy, the Dutch branch of Greenpeace termed CU the greenest political party in 2006.

=== Social issues ===
The CU describes itself as &quot;Christelijk-sociaal&quot; &quot;(Social Christian)&quot; and explicitly distance themselves from the labels Christian socialism or Christian right. &quot;Social Christian&quot; describes a Christian democracy ideology that is more right-wing than Christian socialism and more left-wing than the Christian right and social conservatism. Described as centrist and Orthodox Protestant, it has an emphasis on the community, social solidarity, support for a welfare state, and support for some regulation of market forces but is more conservative on some social issues opposition to euthanasia, embryonic stem cell research, same-sex marriage, abortion, and some elements of the EU. The party is left of centre on issues such as social policy, asylum policy, development aid, green environmental policy and the economy.

The party supports Dutch membership of the European Union to ensure peace and prosperity, and to counter the influence of Russia and China, while simultaneously being critical of several EU policies which it claims are undemocratic and &quot;mainly benefits large companies and the upper middle classes.&quot; The CU instead calls for more transparency within the EU, for domestic decision making of EU member states to be respected and wants reforms made to the Eurozone. The CU is also against the accession of Turkey to the European Union.

=== Members of the cabinet ===

From 2007 to 2010 the CU supplied two ministers and one state secretary in the fourth Balkenende cabinet:
* André Rouvoet, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister without portfolio for Youth and Family Affairs
* Eimert van Middelkoop, Minister of Defence
* Tineke Huizinga, State Secretary and Minister of Environment and Spatial Planning

Starting in 2017, the CU has once again supplied two ministers and one state secretary in the third Rutte cabinet:
* Carola Schouten, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality
* Arie Slob, Minister for Primary Education, Secondary Education and Media
* Paul Blokhuis, State Secretary for Health, Welfare and Sports

The following CU members served in the fourth Rutte cabinet between 2021 and 2024:
* Carola Schouten, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Social Affairs and Employment
* Henk Staghouwer, Minister of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality
* Piet Adema, Minister of Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality
* Maarten van Ooijen, State Secretary of Health, Welfare and Sport

===Members of the House of Representatives===
===Members of the Senate===
==Electorate==
The CU was supported by orthodox Reformed of many denominations, such as the Christian Reformed Churches, the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands, Reformed Churches in the Netherlands (Liberated) and the Dutch Reformed Church. But members of newer churches such as the Evangelical Church and the Pentecostal community also supported this party. The electorate is concentrated in the smaller rural districts in the so-called &quot;Bible Belt&quot; an area of more conservative Christian municipalities that reaches from Overijssel, through the Veluwe and the Biesbos to Zeeland. The party also draws support from Christians with an immigrant background, who are mostly located in the large cities.

The party is also drawing support from a growing number of conservative Roman Catholics, dissatisfied with the less Christian policies of the CDA. Roman Catholics are welcome to become a member of the party although one of the foundations of the party is the Heidelberg Catechism, known for its staunch anti-Catholicism. During the provincial elections of 2007 the party fielded two Roman Catholic candidates on their shortlist of the province of Limburg. This process has alerted some prominent CDA politicians. CU-senator Egbert Schuurman stated the CU would provide a shelter for everyone who actively believes in Jesus Christ but also said the CU will always be a Protestant party.

The party&#x27;s congress, held on 13 June 2015, replaced the Heidelberg Catechism with Nicean Creed.

===Organisational structure===
The highest body in the CU is the Union Congress, formed by delegates from the municipal branches. It appoints the party board and decides the order of the candidates on the lists for elections to the Senate, House of Representatives and European Parliament and has the final say over the party program. A member congress has an important role in the formation of the CU&#x27;s political direction.

===Members===
The CU currently has 25,170 members (as of 1 January 2019). They are organised in over 200 municipal branches.

===Linked organisations===
The youth organisation of the party is PerspectieF which was formed as a fusion of the two youth organisations of the CU&#x27;s predecessors the GPJC and RPFJ. The party publishes the HandSchrift (HandWriting) six times a year. The party&#x27;s scientific institute is the Mr. Groen van Prinsterer Foundation, which publishes the DenkWijzer (ThoughtWiser). The women&#x27;s organisation is Inclusief.

The CU participates in the Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy, a democracy assistance organisation of seven Dutch political parties.

===International organisations===
Internationally the CU is a member of the European Christian Political Movement. Its MEPs were seated in the European Conservatives and Reformists Group. Until 2019 when the CU joined the EPP Group

===Orthodox-Protestant (pillarised) organisations===
The CU still has ideological strong links with so-called pillarised organisations. Together with conservative Protestant schools, papers like the &quot;Nederlands Dagblad&quot; and the &quot;Reformatorisch Dagblad&quot;, the Protestant broadcaster Evangelische Omroep, several Reformed churches they constitute the conservative or orthodox Reformed pillar (Dutch &quot;zuil&quot;). While all four of the traditional Dutch pillars (socialists, liberals, Protestants and Catholics) have broken down since the 1960s, the orthodox reformed pillar has actually strengthened in reaction to the process of secularisation.

===Relationships to other parties===
The Christian Union had been in the opposition until 2006. It has good relations with the orthodox Reformed Political Party (SGP), with which it formed a single European parliamentary party CU-SGP until 2022 and the Christian Democratic Appeal, with which the ChristenUnie-SGP had an electoral alliance for the 2004 European Parliament elections. As an opposition party against the centre-right second Balkenende cabinet, the CU has gained sympathy from the left wing parties in parliament, the Labour Party, the Socialist Party, and the GroenLinks, with which it cooperates in several municipal executives after the 2006 municipal elections.

==International comparisons==
The Evangelical People&#x27;s Party of Switzerland is nearest to the Christian Union as a conservative Protestant party that is left wing in social matters, conservative in ethical matters and critical of the European Union.

<text>The Reformed Political Party ( , SGP) is a conservative Reformed Christian political party in the Netherlands. The SGP is the oldest political party in the Netherlands existing in its present form, and has been in opposition for its entire existence. Since 1925, it has won between 1.5% and 2.5% of the votes in general elections. Owing to its orthodox political ideals and its traditional role in the opposition, the party is considered a testimonial party.

== History ==

===Foundation===

The SGP was founded in 1918 by orthodox Protestants led by Yerseke pastor Gerrit Hendrik Kersten, some of which originated from the Protestant Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP). After the Pacification of 1917, compulsory voting and proportional representation was introduced in the Netherlands. The founders did not want to vote for existing parties, but saw an opportunity for a smaller party because of proportional representation. The party first participated in the 1918 general election. The hastily organised campaign focused on the ARP and its support of what SGP called state coercion, such as compulsory vaccination and insurance law. Because some might object to him combining being polician and pastor, Kersten was not a candidate, but instead Barend Lemans and Pieter Gijze. The party received over 5,000 votes, not enough for a seat.

Despite not winning a seat, the SGP continued its activities In 1919, the party board started a petition against the (Disability Act), which forced workers to pay premiums to insure against disability. It received 4,800 signatures. The party encouraged its members to send back their stamp cards which tracked their premiums. In December 1920, the Senate passed a law that would accommodate their conscientious objections. A similar petition against compulsory vaccination received 27,059 signatures in 1922, but sorted no effect.

===1922–1945===
For the 1922 general election, Kersten was lead candidate, accepting objections within his electorate. The party won one seat in the House of Representatives, which was taken by Kersten. His speeches in parliament regularly received media attention, for example when he opposed the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. In the 1925 general election, the party won another seat which was taken by Pieter Zandt.

Later that year, the anti-Catholic SGP would cause the fall of the second Ruijs de Beerenbrouck cabinet in what became known as the Night of Kersten (). During the debate on the budget of the Foreign Affairs Ministry, Kersten had proposed cutting the budget of the diplomatic mission of the Netherlands to the Holy See. The amendment received a majority, because it was supported by the Protestant Christian Historical Union (CHU), which was in cabinet together with the Catholic General League. It resulted in more publicity and a third seat in the 1929 general election, which was taken by . Kersten, Zandt and Van Dis formed the parliamentary group until the 1937 general election, when the SGP lost one seat. The SGP did not achieve much in parliament other than during the Night of Kersten, but achieved some smaller goals outside of parliament through contact with the ministers.

Kersten saw the German invasion of the Netherlands in 1940 as a punishment for its sins. He rejected resistance against the German occupation and was seen as friendly towards them. After the war, he was nominated again as lead candidate, but he was barred from the House of Representatives for his stances during the war.

===1945–present===

Kersten was succeeded by Zandt, under whose leadership the SGP was very stable, continually getting 2% of votes. In the 1956 general election, the SGP profited from the enlargement of parliament, and entered the Senate for the first time. It lost that seat in 1960 Senate election, but regained it in the 1971 Senate election.

In 1961 Zandt died and was succeeded by Van Dis sr. After ten years he stood down in favour of Reverend Hette Abma, who also stepped down after ten years, in favour of Henk van Rossum, a civil engineer. In the 1984 European Parliament election, the SGP joined the two other orthodox Protestant parties, the Reformatory Political Federation (RPF) and the Reformed Political League (GPV). They won one seat in the European Parliament, which was taken by SGP member Leen van der Waal, a mechanical engineer.
In 1986, Van Rossum was succeeded by Bas van der Vlies. In the 1994 election the party lost one seat in the House, regained it in 1998, and lost it again in 2002. During the 2003 cabinet formation, the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) and the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) held talks with the SGP — the first time that the SGP was seriously considered as a possible coalition partner. Ultimately, the Democrats 66 joined the second Balkenende cabinet instead of the SGP, mostly because of the ideological differences between the VVD and the SGP.
In 2010, Kees van der Staaij succeeded Van der Vlies. During the 2010 cabinet formation, the negotiating CDA, VVD and Party for Freedom (PVV) took into account some wishes of the SGP, so that SGP would provide confidence and supply in the Senate where the first Rutte cabinet did not have a majority.

==Ideology and political positions ==
As a Protestant fundamentalist party the SGP draws much from its ideology from the Reformed Christian tradition, specifically the ecclesiastical doctrinal standards known as the Three Forms of Unity, including an unamended version of the Belgic Confession (). It includes 21 words that were removed by the synod of the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands in 1905, which state that the government must &quot;eliminate and eradicate all idolatry and false religion, so as to destroy the kingdom of Antichrist&quot;. This contrasted with the other two Protestant parties, the Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) and the Christian Historical Union (CHU), which had accepted the change.

=== Church and state ===
The SGP does favor some, but no strict, separation of church and state. The church and state should cooperate, including the advancement of the true faith. The state should not curtail the freedom of the church, while the church similarly should not impose upon the state. Abma rejected theocracy as form of government, instead harmonizing theocracy and democracy. Over time, it has however become more realistic, accepting the religiously neutral state.

The SGP supports the freedom of conscience, but not an unconditional freedom of religion. For example, it rejects the freedom of publicly exercising religion when they consider it idolatry or false religion.

=== Women&#x27;s rights ===
The SGP generally opposes women&#x27;s suffrage, both passive and active. SGP believes it is against a &quot;woman&#x27;s calling&quot;. From the start, the party is not united on this issue. Opponents argue that the biblical argumentation is not clear or that this could hurt them electorally. In 1989 the party changed its principles, approving women voting if they can answer this to God in their conscience.

=== Trans rights ===
In 2024, the SGP tabled a motion in the House of Representatives to abolish the so-called “transgender law” which had been brought in under the previous Dutch government and would enable people under the age of 16 to legally declare their gender without requiring a medical diagnosis.

== Election results ==

=== House of Representatives ===
===European Parliament===
Between 1984 and 2019, the SGP filed joint candidate lists with the Christian Union and its predecessors. See CU-SGP for these election results.
== Representation ==

=== Leadership ===
===House of Representatives===
===Senate===
===European Parliament===
Since the 1984 European Parliament election the party has had one elected representative in the European Parliament. From 1984 to 1997 Leen van der Waal was the representative, from 1999 Bas Belder was the party&#x27;s representative, succeeded by Bert-Jan Ruissen in the 2019 European Parliament election. In European Parliament elections, the SGP formed one candidate list with the Christian Union, called CU–SGP, until the 2024 European Parliament election. Currently the SGP is a member of the European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR Group) in the European Parliament.

==Electorate==
The SGP has had a very stable electorate since first entering the States-General in 1922. Since winning a second seat in 1926, it has usually varied between two and three seats in the House of Representatives.

Most of its electorate is formed by so-called pietistic Reformed Protestants (&quot;&quot;), Reformed Protestants for whom personal religious experience is very important. Most of the Old Reformed Congregations and the Reformed Congregations are considered pietistic Reformed Protestants. Pietistic Reformed Protestants are also present in the Christian Reformed Churches, the Reformed Association in the Protestant Church in the Netherlands and the Restored Reformed Church. Not all SGP voters are however pietistic Reformed Protestants, and not all pietistic Reformed Protestants vote SGP.

=== Geographical ===

The SGP&#x27;s support is concentrated geographically in the Dutch Bible Belt, a band of strongly Reformed and mostly rural municipalities ranging from Zeeland in the South via Goeree-Overflakkee and the Alblasserwaard in South Holland and the Veluwe in Gelderland to the Western part of Overijssel, around Staphorst. Outside the Bible Belt, the SGP also performs well in Urk, Uddel and Rijssen-Holten. The geographical concentration of SGP voters has however decreased between 1956 and 2017. Its votes have shifted away from Utrecht and South Holland towards Zeeland, Gelderland, Overijssel, with a modest turnout in Drenthe and Gelderland.

=== Socio-demographic ===
Despite SGP&#x27;s opposition to women&#x27;s suffrage, it draws significant support from women. In the period 1971–1977, when the Dutch National Voter Survey started, around half of its voters were female. This declined to 34% in 1989–1998, but rose back to half in 2010–2017. In the March 2021 general election and the March 2023 provincial elections, nearly 60% of SGP voters were female.

==Organisation==

===Organisational structure===
The highest organ of the SGP is the congress, which is formed by delegates from the municipal branches. It convenes once every year. It appoints the party board and decides the order of the Senate, House of Representatives, European Parliament candidates list and has the last say over the party program. The SGP chairman is always a minister. Since 2001 this position is ceremonial, as the general chair leads the party&#x27;s organisation.

The party has 245 municipal branches and has a provincial federation in each province, except for Limburg.

=== Membership ===
==== Female membership ====

Initially, women were not allowed to be member of the party. In 1983, the first woman, W. van Donge-van Bezooijen, applied for membership, but The Hague electoral association had rejected her application because she was a woman. She then wrote to the national party board, after which she and Riet Grabijn-van Putten became member in 1985. The party board however changed its position in 1991, rejecting membership for women. This position was supported by ninety percent of electoral associations in 1993. The party was aware that this might be against the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women.

Meanwhile, public opinion in the Netherlands turned against SGP&#x27;s decision not to allow women. UN committees also recommended intervention. In 2003, the Clara Wichmann Institute and some other organisations sued the Dutch government, for subsidising SGP. The district court of The Hague ruled that the party could no longer receive subsidies from the government, while it did not force the SGP to change it statutes. Based on the verdict, the party decided to allow female membership, while still not allowing them on candidate lists. At the end of 2017, SGP had 800 female members.

Meanwhile in 2005, the Dutch government had refused the SGP&#x27;s application for subsidies. The administrative law division of the district court of The Hague supported the rejection. However, the Council of State overturned this decision in December 2007, maintaining that a party&#x27;s political philosophy takes precedence, and that women have the opportunity to join other political parties where they can obtain a leadership role. Two weeks later, The Hague courts of appeal ruled on the first case that the SGP should also allow women&#x27;s passive suffrage. The Supreme Court of the Netherlands affirmed this decision in 2010 and an appeal to the European Court of Human Rights was unsuccessful in 2012. As a result, the SGP changed its internal regulations to allow women to be candidates in elections.

Some women have been candidates starting with the 2014 municipal elections, with lead candidate becoming the first female elected representative for the SGP when she was elected municipal councilor in Vlissingen in 2014.

===Linked organisations===
The party publishes the Banner () two-weekly since 1921. Its think tank was founded in 1974, and it was renamed after Walloon theologian Guido de Brès in 1992. It publishes the quarterly magazine Zicht (Sight). The youth organisation of the SGP is called the Reformed Political Party Youth (SGPJ), which with its approximately 12,000 members is the largest political youth organization in the Netherlands.

The SGP participates in the Netherlands Institute for Multiparty Democracy, a democracy assistance organisation of seven Dutch political parties.

===Pillarised organisations===
The SGP has close links with several other orthodox Protestant organisations, such as several Reformed churches and the newspaper &quot;Reformatorisch Dagblad&quot;. Together they form a small but strong orthodox-Reformed pillar.

===Relationships to other parties===

Until 1963, the SGP was relatively isolated in parliament. The strongly antipapal SGP refused to cooperate with either the Catholic People&#x27;s Party or the secular People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and Labour Party (PvdA). The also Protestant, larger Anti-Revolutionary Party (ARP) had some sympathy for the SGP, but cooperated more tightly with the KVP and the other Protestant party, the Christian Historical Union (CHU). In 1963 another orthodox Protestant party, the Reformed Political League (GPV) entered parliament, in 1981 they were joined by the Reformatory Political Federation (RPF). Together these three parties formed the &quot;Small Christian parties&quot;. They shared the same orthodox Protestant political ideals and had the same political strategy, as testimonial parties. They cooperated in municipalities, both in municipal executives, where the parties were strong, as well as in common municipal parties, where the parties were weak. In the 1984 European Parliamentary election the parties presented a common list and they won one seat in parliament. After 1993 the cooperation between the GPV and the RPF intensified, but the SGP&#x27;s position at the time on female suffrage prevented the SGP joining this closer cooperation. However, in 2000 the GPV and RPF merged to form the ChristianUnion (CU). Traditionally the SGP and the CU worked together closely as they were both based on Protestant Christian politics. Recently however, as the CU has moved more towards the centre-left, discernible differences of philosophy between the SGP and CU have caused the parties to not join in elections. The most notable example was the 2011 Senate election where the SGP and CU did not combine their votes.

<text>Friedrich Dürrenmatt (; 5 January 1921 – 14 December 1990) was a Swiss author and dramatist. He was a proponent of epic theatre whose plays reflected the recent experiences of World War II. The politically active author&#x27;s work included avant-garde dramas, philosophical crime novels, and macabre satire. Dürrenmatt was a member of the Gruppe Olten, a group of left-wing Swiss writers who convened regularly at a restaurant in the city of Olten.

==Life==
Dürrenmatt was born in Konolfingen, canton of Bern, the son of a Protestant pastor. His grandfather, Ulrich Dürrenmatt, was a conservative politician. The family moved to Bern in 1935. Dürrenmatt began studies in philosophy, German philology, and German literature at the University of Zürich in 1941, but moved to the University of Bern after one semester where he also studied natural science. In 1943, he decided to become an author and dramatist and dropped his academic career. In 1945–46, he wrote his first play &quot;It Is Written&quot;. On 11 October 1946, he married the actress Lotti Geissler. 

Dürrenmatt traveled in 1969 to the United States, in 1974 to Israel, and in 1990 to Auschwitz in Poland.

In 1975 he played himself in the film &quot;End of the Game.&quot;

Dürrenmatt also enjoyed painting. Some of his works and his drawings were exhibited in Neuchâtel in 1976 and 1985 and in Zürich in 1978.

His wife, Lotti Geissler, died on 16 January 1983. Dürrenmatt married another actress, Charlotte Kerr, in 1984.

In 1990 he gave two famous speeches, one in honour of Václav Havel (&quot;Die Schweiz, ein Gefängnis?/Switzerland a Prison?&quot;) on discovering that he had been spied on for five decades, along with 800,000 of his left-leaning fellow citizens, by the Swiss secret service; the other in honour of Mikhail Gorbachev (&quot;Kants Hoffnung/Kant&#x27;s Hope&quot;). Dürrenmatt often compared the three Abrahamic religions and Marxism, which he also saw as a religion.

Dürrenmatt died from heart failure on 14 December 1990 in Neuchâtel.

Since 2000 his works have been exhibited in the Centre Dürrenmatt, part of the Swiss National Library.

==Dramatic works==
Like Bertolt Brecht Dürrenmatt explored the dramatic possibilities of epic theatre. Next to Brecht he has been called its &quot;most original theorist&quot;.

When he was 26 his first play, &quot;It Is Written&quot;, premiered to great controversy. The story of the play revolves around a battle between a sensation-craving cynic and a religious fanatic who takes scripture literally, all of this taking place while the city they live in is under siege. The play&#x27;s opening night in April 1947 caused fights and protests in the audience. Between 1948 and 1949 Dürrenmatt wrote several segments and sketches for the anti-Nazi Cabaret Cornichon in Zürich including the short single-act grotesque play &quot;Der Gerettete&quot; (&quot;The Rescued&quot;).

His first major success was the play &quot;Romulus the Great&quot;. Set in the year A.D. 476, the play explores the last days of the Roman Empire, presided over and brought about by its last emperor, Romulus. &quot;The Visit&quot; (&quot;Der Besuch der alten Dame&quot;, 1956) is a grotesque fusion of comedy and tragedy about a wealthy woman who offers the people of her hometown a fortune if they will avenge the wrongs done to her. The satirical drama &quot;The Physicists&quot; (&quot;Die Physiker&quot;, 1962), which deals with issues concerning science and its responsibility for dramatic and dangerous changes to the world, has also been presented in translation.

Radio plays published in English include &quot;Hercules in the Augean Stables&quot; (&quot;Herkules und der Stall des Augias&quot;, 1954), &quot;Incident at Twilight&quot; (&quot;Abendstunde im Spätherbst&quot;, 1952) and &quot;The Mission of the Vega&quot; (&quot;Das Unternehmen der Wega&quot;, 1954). The two late works &quot;Labyrinth&quot; and &quot;Turmbau zu Babel&quot; are a collection of unfinished ideas, stories and philosophical thoughts.

His novel, &quot;A Dangerous Game&quot; (also known as &quot;Die Panne&quot; (&quot;Traps&quot;)) was adapted into a Marathi play, &quot;Shantata! Court Chalu Aahe&quot; (Silence! The Court Is in Session) by Indian playwright Vijay Tendulkar in 1967. The play has since then been performed in various Indian languages, and made into a film by the same name by Satyadev Dubey.

His play &quot;The Visit&quot; has been adapted and Indianised into a play called &quot;Miss.Meena&quot; by Chennai-based theatre group &#x27;perch&#x27;. &quot;The Visit&quot; has also been adapted as a musical by Kander and Ebb.

<text>Jan Pieter&quot;Jan Peter&quot;Balkenende Jr. ( ; born 7 May 1956) is a Dutch politician of the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) party and jurist who served as Prime Minister of the Netherlands from 22 July 2002 to 14 October 2010.

Balkenende studied History and Law at the Free University Amsterdam obtaining Master of Arts and law degrees and worked as a legal counsel for the academic council of his alma mater before finishing his thesis and graduated as a PhD in governmental studies and worked as a professor of Christian theology at his alma mater from April 1993 until May 2002. After the election of 1998, Balkenende was elected as a Member of the House of Representatives on 19 May 1998 and served as a frontbencher and spokesperson for Finances and as deputy parliamentary leader. After Party Leader and Parliamentary leader, Jaap de Hoop Scheffer stepped down before an upcoming election Balkenende announced his candidacy and was selected as his successor on 1 October 2001. For the election of 2002, Balkenende served as lead candidate and after a cabinet formation with the Pim Fortuyn List and the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy formed the Cabinet Balkenende I and became Prime Minister of the Netherlands taking office 22 July 2002.

The cabinet Balkenende I fell just 87 days into its term. For the election of 2003, Balkenende again served as lead candidate and following a cabinet formation with the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy and Democrats 66, they formed the Cabinet Balkenende II and continued as prime minister. This second cabinet fell on 30 June 2006 and was replaced with the caretaker Cabinet Balkenende III on 7 July 2006. For the election of 2006, Balkenende once again served as lead candidate and following a cabinet formation with Labour Leader Wouter Bos and fellow Christian-democrats, formed the Cabinet Balkenende IV and continued as prime minister for another term. This fourth cabinet fell exactly 3 years into its term. For the election of 2010, Balkenende once again served as lead candidate but suffered a large defeat and announced his retirement and stepped down as Leader on 9 June 2010. Balkenende left office following the installation of the Cabinet Rutte I on 14 October 2010.

Balkenende retired from active politics at 54 and became active in the private sector as a corporate director and also works as a professor of Governance, Institutions and Internationalization at the Erasmus University Rotterdam since December 2010. During his premiership, his cabinets were responsible for several major reforms to the education system, immigration laws and reducing the deficit following the financial crisis of 2008. He is the fourth longest-serving Prime Minister after World War II and his premiership is consistently regarded both by scholars and the public to have been above average. Balkenende was granted the honorary title of Minister of State on 14 October 2022 exactly twelve years after leaving office.

==Early life==
Jan Pieter Balkenende Jr. was born on 7 May 1956 in Biezelinge in the province of Zeeland in a family belonging to the Reformed faith, the son of Jan Pieter Balkenende Sr. a cereal grains merchant and Thona Johanna Sandee, a teacher.

During his childhood, Balkenende was an active supporter of the Dutch football team PSV Eindhoven, along with his father he frequented many matches. He also regularly visited the local music school and theatre. Balkenende went to a Reformed Protestant primary school in Kapelle. He attended secondary school at the &quot;Christian Lyceum for Zeeland&quot; in Goes, graduating in 1974.

He studied at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam where he received an MA degree in history in 1980, subsequently an LLM degree in Dutch law in 1982, and finally a PhD in law in 1992.

Balkenende resides with his wife, Bianca Hoogendijk, and his daughter, Amelie, in Capelle aan den IJssel. During his tenure as prime minister, he did not use the Catshuis, the formal residency of the Prime Minister.

==Early political career==




He began his career on the staff of the research institute of the CDA and as a city councilman in Amstelveen. 
As a councilman, he proposed the Krokettenmotie which gave council members the right to a croquette if the council went past 23:00 and it was passed. 
In 1992, he received his PhD with a thesis on &quot;Governance regulation and social organisations&quot; (Overheidsregelgeving en maatschappelijke organisaties), which was strongly inspired by the Communitarian ideas of Amitai Etzioni. One year later in 1993, he became an extraordinary professor of Christian-Social Thought at the Free University of Amsterdam.

Balkenende first entered the House of Representatives on 19 May 1998 while the CDA was in opposition. He became the CDA&#x27;s financial spokesman and was also involved with social affairs, justice, and domestic affairs. In this role, he advocated a substantial reduction of the national debt and sound public finances.

He was elected Chairman of the CDA parliamentary fraction on 1 October 2001, succeeding Jaap de Hoop Scheffer. On 3 November 2001, he was appointed lead candidate for the CDA in the tumultuous May 2002 parliamentary elections. These elections restored the CDA&#x27;s former position as the largest political party in the House of Representatives. 

==Prime Minister of the Netherlands==
===First cabinet===

On 4 July 2002, Queen Beatrix asked Balkenende to form a new government after the general elections following the resignation of Prime Minister Wim Kok. The coalition cabinet included the Pim Fortuyn List (LPF) party, whose leader (Pim Fortuyn) was assassinated just days before the election. It collapsed after just 87 days in office because of internal conflicts within the LPF that destabilised the government.

===Second cabinet===

After early elections in 2003, Balkenende formed his second government with the Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), the liberal People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) and the progressive liberal D66. Once again leader of a centre-right coalition, Balkenende&#x27;s policies centred on reform of the Dutch public services, social security, pre-pension facilities, public health, reducing crime, a tough immigration policy and historically large cuts in public spending. The measures gave rise to large public anger and bad results in opinion polls for his CDA party. While his party remained the largest Dutch delegation in the European Parliament after the European elections, beating the general expectation of a huge loss in parliamentary seats, the party suffered strong losses during Dutch municipal elections of 2006, losing their position as the largest party in many municipalities. Despite his unpopularity among Dutch voters (polls in 2006 showed that only 26–33% of the voters had confidence in him as prime minister), his position as leader of the CDA remained stable. In the beginning of 2006, some CDA members tried to replace Balkenende as leader with Agriculture Minister Cees Veerman. Veerman did not accept the proposition and offered his support to Balkenende. Balkenende&#x27;s popularity recovered since then, surpassing that of his main competitor Wouter Bos in the autumn of 2006. By then, 53% preferred Balkenende as Prime Minister of the Netherlands while 40% preferred Bos. The switch in public opinion is sometimes explained by the steady recovery of the Dutch economy during the last year of his administration and the positive effects of the reformed policy of the Balkenende cabinet, combined with declining confidence in Bos as a good alternative for the position of prime minister.

On 1 July 2004, Balkenende took up the rotating presidency of the European Union.

===Third cabinet===

On 30 June 2006, the Democrats 66, the smallest coalition party, withdrew its support of the government over the way Immigration Minister Rita Verdonk had handled the crisis around the naturalisation of Ayaan Hirsi Ali, a member of the House of Representatives. Balkenende resigned for the second time as Prime Minister of the Netherlands, announced early elections and presented his third government a week later. This rump cabinet, formed of a minority coalition of CDA and VVD, stayed in office until the elections of 22 November 2006.

===Fourth cabinet===

Though his old coalition partners VVD and D66 fared badly in the parliamentary elections of 2006, Balkenende managed to defend the dominant position of his CDA. Needing alternative coalition partners to form a new majority government, he formed a social-Christian coalition with the Labour Party (PvdA) and the orthodox-Protestant Christian Union. The Fourth Balkenende cabinet was formed after Balkenende was appointed &quot;formateur&quot; by Queen Beatrix on 9 February 2007. His cabinet was announced on 13 February and was scheduled to be in office until 2011, but it fell in the early morning of 20 February 2010 as the result of disagreement between the majority of the parliament and the coalition partners CDA and PvdA over the extension of the Dutch ISAF-mission in Afghanistan. In contrast to the formation of a new caretaker cabinet with full responsibility (Balkenende III after the fall of Balkenende II), Balkenende IV continued as a demissionary cabinet, a caretaker cabinet with limited responsibility. Balkenende government opposed Ukraine and Georgia becoming NATO action plan members at 2008 Bucharest summit. &quot;Ukraine is seen by Russia as part of its own historic and cultural domain,&quot; Dutch politician stated.

==2010 election and resignation==
Despite serious criticism by former prime ministers from the CDA, Balkenende was the Christian Democratic Appeal lead candidate for the Dutch general election of 2010.
Balkenende raised mild controversy during his campaign for the 2010 Dutch elections. While appearing in a television show, Balkenende was asked by a female presenter what parties he would most likely form a coalition with. Balkenende first gave evasive answers, then when asked again by the presenter, responded saying &quot;U kijkt zo lief&quot; (English: &quot;You look so cute&quot;). The comment was regarded as sexist and criticised by several people, including Opzij chief-editor Margriet van der Linden and GroenLinks leader Femke Halsema (who stated that &quot;[the prime minister] deserves a knee to the groin&quot; (in Dutch: &quot;een knietje verdient&quot;)). Balkenende apologised for the comment later.

On 9 June 2010, Balkenende resigned his position as leader of the CDA as well as his seat in the newly elected parliament, taking political responsibility for the CDA&#x27;s disappointing election results in the 2010 general election.

==Other issues==
In 2004, during his second cabinet, Balkenende was diagnosed with necrotising fasciitis. He was treated through surgical debridement and made a full recovery after several weeks in hospital.

On 4 June 2005, the Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs Karel De Gucht said in the Flemish newspaper &quot;Het Laatste Nieuws&quot; (The Latest News) that &quot;Balkenende is a mix of Harry Potter and a petty rigid bourgeois mentality&quot;. This comparison caused a small diplomatic controversy, and the Belgian ambassador had to apologise to Ben Bot, the Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs. Retired deputy prime minister Hans Wiegel commented he preferred Harry Potter to the Manneken Pis.

Balkenende has a close relationship with the Dutch people from Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles. He has visited several Keti Koti celebrations in recent years.

Balkenende&#x27;s nicknames were &quot;JP&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, among others.

He was a member of the Reformed Churches in the Netherlands and since 1 May 2004, a member of the Protestant Church in the Netherlands.

<text>In folklore, crossroads may represent a location &quot;between the worlds&quot; and, as such, a site where supernatural spirits can be contacted and paranormal events can take place. Symbolically, it can mean a locality where two realms touch and therefore represents liminality, a place literally &quot;neither here nor there&quot;, &quot;betwixt and between&quot;.

==Ancient religions==

 In Greek mythology, crossroads were associated with both Hecate and Hermes, with shrines and ceremonies for both taking place there. The herm pillar associated with Hermes frequently marked these places due to the god&#x27;s association with travelers and role as a guide. Though less central to Greek mythology than Hermes, Hecate&#x27;s connection to crossroads was more cemented in ritual. &#x27;Suppers of Hecate&#x27; were left for her at crossroads at each new moon, and one of her most common titles was &#x27;goddess of the crossroads.&#x27; In her later three-fold depictions, each of the three heads or bodies is often associated with one of three crossing roads.

&quot;According to the fourth-century historian Philochorus... at Athens, offerings also were sent to the crossroads on the sixteenth of the month - i.e., half a month after the new-moon offering, at the time of the full moon.&quot; In Graeco-Roman society, rituals of protection were done at crossroads and purification ritual remains were left at the crossroads. The Greeks and Romans believed doors, gates, rivers, frontiers and crossroads held spiritual meanings regarding transitioning, leaving one area and going somewhere else, a change in directions physically and spiritually; therefore rituals of protection and rituals regarding change (transition) were done at crossroads.

An 11th-century homily called &quot;De Falsis Deis&quot; tells us that Mercury or Odin were honored on crossroads.

:53. Sum man eac wæs gehaten Mercurius on life, se wæs swyðe facenfull
:54. And, ðeah full snotorwyrde, swicol on dædum and on leasbregdum. Ðone
:55. macedon þa hæðenan be heora getæle eac heom to mæran gode and æt wega
:56. gelætum him lac offrodon oft and gelome þurh deofles lare and to heagum
:57. beorgum him brohton oft mistlice loflac.

The modern English text gives:
&quot;There once lived a man named Mercury, who was very deceitful, and, though quite wise in speech, was treacherous in actions and lies. The pagans, in their account, also made him their great god and often and frequently offered him sacrifices at crossroads, through the teachings of the devil, and to high hills they often brought various offerings of praise.&quot;

==Medieval folklore==

In Great Britain, there existed a tradition of burying criminals and suicides at the crossroads. This may have been due to the crossroads marking the boundaries of the settlement coupled with a desire to bury those outside of the law outside the settlement, or that the many roads would confuse the dead. Crossroads were also commonly used as a place of criminal punishment and execution (e.g. by gibbet or dule tree), which may have also been a reason for it being a site of suicidal burial as suicide was considered a crime. This ritual of crossroads burial dates back to Anglo-Saxon times and continued until being abolished in 1823.

While they became a place of burial for suicides and others unable to be given proper burial in the Middle Ages, the crossroads were once a burial place second only to the consecrated church for Christians.

In Western folk mythology, a crossroads can be used to summon a demon or devil in order to make a deal. This legend can be seen in many stories. For example, the 1587 &quot;Historia von D. Johann Fausten&quot;, describes the character Faust inscribing magic circles at a crossroads in order to summon the devil. The Freischütz folktales often similarly involve summoning the devil at a crossroads in order to cast magic bullets.

In the 1885 historical essay &quot;Transylvanian Superstitions&quot;, Emily Gerard describes how crossroads were often avoided as a matter of course, and describes a Romanian belief that a demon could be summoned at a crossroad by drawing a magic circle, offering copper coin as payment, and reciting an incantation.

==Hoodoo==

In conjure, rootwork, and hoodoo, a form of African magical spirituality practiced by African Americans in the United States, the crossroads in Hoodoo originates from the Kongo cosmogram in Central Africa. It represents the rising and setting of the sun, and the human life cycle of death and rebirth. The center of the crossroads is where the communication with spirits take place. During the transatlantic slave trade, the Kongo cosmogram was brought to the United States by African slaves. Archeologists unearthed representations of the Kongo cosmogram on slave plantations in South Carolina on clay pots made by enslaved Africans. The Kongo cosmogram is also called the Bakongo cosmogram and the &quot;Yowa&quot; cross. The Yowa cross (Kongo cosmogram) &quot;Is a fork in the road (or even a forked branch) can allude to this crucially important symbol of passage and communication between worlds. The &#x27;turn&#x27; in the path,&#x27; i.e., the crossroads, remains an indelible concept in the Kongo-Atlantic world, as the point of intersection between the ancestors and the living.&quot; &quot;It is at the crossroads where many Africans believe one will witness the powers of God and emerge from the waters spiritually renewed.&quot;

Other African origins of the crossroads in Hoodoo are found in West Africa among the Yoruba people. For example, the Yoruba trickster deity called Eshu-Elegba resides at the crossroads, and the Yoruba people leave offerings for Eshu-Elegba at the crossroads. In Hoodoo, there is a spirit that resides at the crossroads to give offering for; however, the word Eshu-Elegba does not exist in Hoodoo because the names of African deities were lost during slavery. Folklorist Newbell Niles Puckett, recorded a number of crossroads rituals in Hoodoo practiced among African-Americans in the South and explained its meaning. Puckett wrote...&quot;Possibly this custom of sacrificing at the crossroads is due to the idea that spirits, like men, travel the highways and would be more likely to hit upon the offering at the crossroads than elsewhere.&quot; African crossroads spirits were brought to the United States during the transatlantic slave trade. In the Vodou tradition, Papa Legba is the lwa of crossroads and a messenger to the spirit world. 

In Hoodoo, there has been a practice that is believed to be hoodoo in origin such as selling your soul to the devil at the crossroads in order to acquire facility at various manual and body skills, such as playing a musical instrument, throwing dice, or dancing. It is believed that one may attend upon a crossroads a certain number of times, either at midnight or just before dawn, and one will meet a &quot;black man,&quot; whom some call the Devil, who will bestow upon one the desired skills. This practice is believed to have originated from an African American Blues musician by the name of Robert Johnson. In the oral history of hoodoo it is said that Robert Johnson became a skilled Blues musician after he sold his soul to the devil at the crossroads, and because of this, people began going to a crossroads at midnight to sell their soul to a devil to acquire a skill or to become better at a skill. The family of Robert Johnson have come forward and said this is not true. How Johnson became a skilled Blues musician was through training under Ike Zimmerman who was a blues guitarist. In an article from the National Blues Museum it reads... &quot;In the case of Robert Johnson, many family members have come forward to dispel these rumors and have advocated that the truth be told about Robert Johnson. During the time that he was missing, Johnson returned home, where he ran into Ike Zimmerman. Zimmerman took Johnson under his wing, and from years of practicing, Johnson became the legendary Blues musician that we know today.&quot; Therefore, the idea one can sell their soul to the devil at the crossroads and acquire a skill may not be traditional in Hoodoo.

==Brazilian mythology==
Crossroads are very important both in Brazilian mythology (related to the headless mule, the devil, the Besta Fera and the Brazilian version of the werewolf) and religions (as the favourite place for the manifestation of &quot;left-hand&quot; entities such as Exus and where to place offerings to the Orishas). Eshu and Legba derive from the same African deity, although they are viewed in markedly different manners among traditions. For example, Papa Legba is considered by Haitian Vodou practitioners to be closest to Saint Peter, although in Brazilian Quimbanda it is not uncommon to see Exu closely associated with demonic entities such as Lucifer, clad in Mephistophelean attire and bearing a trident.

==In modern fiction==
===Blues songs===
Some 20th-century blues songs may be about making a deal with the devil at the crossroads. Many modern listeners believe that the premier song about soul-selling at a crossroads is &quot;Cross Road Blues&quot; by Robert Johnson. According to a legend, Johnson himself sold his soul at a crossroads in order to learn to play the guitar. This is chronicled in the Netflix documentary &quot;&quot;. However, the song&#x27;s lyrics merely describe a man trying to hitchhike; the sense of foreboding has been interpreted as the singer&#x27;s apprehension of finding himself, a young black man in the 1920s deep south, alone after dark and at the mercy of passing motorists.

<doc id="63185" wikidata="Q178577" url="?curid=63185" title="Norbert Wiener">
<text>Norbert Wiener (November 26, 1894 – March 18, 1964) was an American computer scientist, mathematician and philosopher. He became a professor of mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). A child prodigy, Wiener later became an early researcher in stochastic and mathematical noise processes, contributing work relevant to electronic engineering, electronic communication, and control systems.

Wiener is considered the originator of cybernetics, the science of communication as it relates to living things and machines, with implications for engineering, systems control, computer science, biology, neuroscience, philosophy, and the organization of society. His work heavily influenced computer pioneer John von Neumann, information theorist Claude Shannon, anthropologists Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson, and others.

Wiener is credited as being one of the first to theorize that all intelligent behavior was the result of feedback mechanisms, that could possibly be simulated by machines and was an important early step towards the development of modern artificial intelligence.

==Biography==

===Youth===
Wiener was born in Columbia, Missouri, the first child of Leo Wiener and Bertha Kahn, Jewish immigrants from Lithuania and Germany, respectively. Through his father, he was related to Maimonides, the famous rabbi, philosopher and physician from Al Andalus, as well as to Akiva Eger, chief rabbi of Posen from 1815 to 1837.

Leo had educated Norbert at home until 1903, employing teaching methods of his own invention, except for a brief interlude when Norbert was seven years of age. Earning his living teaching German and Slavic languages, Leo read widely and accumulated a personal library from which the young Norbert benefited greatly. Leo also had ample ability in mathematics and tutored his son in the subject until he left home. In his autobiography, Norbert described his father as calm and patient, unless he (Norbert) failed to give a correct answer, at which his father would lose his temper.

In &quot;The Theory of Ignorance&quot;, a paper he wrote at the age of 10, he disputed &quot;man’s presumption in declaring that his knowledge has no limits&quot;, arguing that all human knowledge &quot;is based on an approximation&quot;, and acknowledging &quot;the impossibility of being certain of anything.&quot;

He graduated from Ayer High School in 1906 at 11 years of age, and Wiener then entered Tufts College. He was awarded a BA in mathematics in 1909 at the age of 14, whereupon he began graduate studies of zoology at Harvard. In 1910 he transferred to Cornell to study philosophy. He graduated in 1911 at 17 years of age.

===Harvard and World War I===
The next year he returned to Harvard, while still continuing his philosophical studies. Back at Harvard, Wiener became influenced by Edward Vermilye Huntington, whose mathematical interests ranged from axiomatic foundations to engineering problems. Harvard awarded Wiener a PhD in June 1913, when he was only 19 years old, for a dissertation on mathematical logic (a comparison of the work of Ernst Schröder with that of Alfred North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell), supervised by Karl Schmidt, the essential results of which were published as Wiener (1914). He was one of the youngest to achieve such a feat. In that dissertation, he was the first to state publicly that ordered pairs can be defined in terms of elementary set theory. Hence relations can be defined by set theory, thus the theory of relations does not require any axioms or primitive notions distinct from those of set theory. In 1921, Kazimierz Kuratowski proposed a simplification of Wiener&#x27;s definition of ordered pairs, and that simplification has been in common use ever since. It is (x, y) = .

In 1914, Wiener traveled to Europe, to be taught by Bertrand Russell and G. H. Hardy at Cambridge University, and by David Hilbert and Edmund Landau at the University of Göttingen. At Göttingen he also attended three courses with Edmund Husserl &quot;one on Kant&#x27;s ethical writings, one on the principles of Ethics, and the seminary on Phenomenology.&quot; (Letter to Russell, c. June or July, 1914). During 1915–16, he taught philosophy at Harvard, then was an engineer for General Electric and wrote for the &quot;Encyclopedia Americana&quot;. Wiener was briefly a journalist for the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;, where he wrote a feature story on the poor labor conditions for mill workers in Lawrence, Massachusetts, but he was fired soon afterwards for his reluctance to write favorable articles about a politician the newspaper&#x27;s owners sought to promote.

Although Wiener eventually became a staunch pacifist, he eagerly contributed to the war effort in World War I. In 1916, with America&#x27;s entry into the war drawing closer, Wiener attended a training camp for potential military officers but failed to earn a commission. One year later Wiener again tried to join the military, but the government again rejected him due to his poor eyesight. In the summer of 1918, Oswald Veblen invited Wiener to work on ballistics at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. Living and working with other mathematicians strengthened his interest in mathematics. However, Wiener was still eager to serve in uniform and decided to make one more attempt to enlist, this time as a common soldier. Wiener wrote in a letter to his parents, &quot;I should consider myself a pretty cheap kind of a swine if I were willing to be an officer but unwilling to be a soldier.&quot; This time the army accepted Wiener into its ranks and assigned him, by coincidence, to a unit stationed at Aberdeen, Maryland. World War I ended just days after Wiener&#x27;s return to Aberdeen and Wiener was discharged from the military in February 1919.

===After the war===
Wiener was unable to secure a permanent position at Harvard, a situation he attributed largely to anti-Semitism at the university and in particular the antipathy of Harvard mathematician G. D. Birkhoff. He was also rejected for a position at the University of Melbourne. At W. F. Osgood&#x27;s suggestion, Wiener was hired as an instructor of mathematics at MIT, where, after his promotion to professor, he spent the remainder of his career. For many years his photograph was prominently displayed in the Infinite Corridor and often used in giving directions, but by 2017 it had been removed.

In 1926, Wiener returned to Europe as a Guggenheim scholar. He spent most of his time at Göttingen and with Hardy at Cambridge, working on Brownian motion, the Fourier integral, Dirichlet&#x27;s problem, harmonic analysis, and the Tauberian theorems.

In 1926, Wiener&#x27;s parents arranged his marriage to a German immigrant, Margaret Engemann; they had two daughters. His sister, Constance (1898–1973), married mathematician Philip Franklin. Their daughter, Janet, Wiener&#x27;s niece, married mathematician Václav E. Beneš. Norbert Wiener&#x27;s sister, Bertha (1902–1995), married the botanist Carroll William Dodge.

Many tales, perhaps apocryphal, were told of Norbert Wiener at MIT, especially concerning his absent-mindedness. It was said that he returned home once to find his house empty. He inquired of a neighborhood girl the reason, and she said that the family had moved elsewhere that day. He thanked her for the information and she replied, &quot;It&#x27;s ok, Daddy, Mommy sent me to get you&quot;.
Asked about the story, Wiener&#x27;s daughter reportedly asserted that &quot;he never forgot who his children were! The rest of it, however, was pretty close to what actually happened…&quot;

In the run-up to World War II (1939–45) Wiener became a member of the China Aid Society and the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced German Scholars.
He was interested in placing scholars such as Yuk-Wing Lee and Antoni Zygmund who had lost their positions.

===During and after World War II===
During World War II, his work on the automatic aiming and firing of anti-aircraft guns caused Wiener to investigate information theory independently of Claude Shannon and to invent the Wiener filter. (The now-standard practice of modeling an information source as a random process—in other words, as a variety of noise—is due to Wiener.) Initially his anti-aircraft work led him to write, with Arturo Rosenblueth and Julian Bigelow, the 1943 article &#x27;Behavior, Purpose and Teleology&#x27;, which was published in Philosophy of Science. Subsequently his anti-aircraft work led him to formulate cybernetics. After the war, his fame helped MIT to recruit a research team in cognitive science, composed of researchers in neuropsychology and the mathematics and biophysics of the nervous system, including Warren Sturgis McCulloch and Walter Pitts. These men later made pioneering contributions to computer science and artificial intelligence. Soon after the group was formed, Wiener suddenly ended all contact with its members, mystifying his colleagues. This emotionally traumatized Pitts, and led to his career decline. In their biography of Wiener, Conway and Siegelman suggest that Wiener&#x27;s wife Margaret, who detested McCulloch&#x27;s bohemian lifestyle, engineered the breach.

Patrick D. Wall speculated that after the publication of &quot;Cybernetics&quot;, Wiener asked McCulloch for some physiological facts about the brain that he could then theorize. McCulloch told him &quot;a mixture of what was known to be true and what McCulloch thought should be&quot;. Wiener then theorized it, went to a physiology congress, and was shot down. Wiener was convinced that McCulloch had set him up.

Wiener later helped develop the theories of cybernetics, robotics, computer control, and automation. He discussed the modeling of neurons with John von Neumann, and in a letter from November 1946 von Neumann presented his thoughts in advance of a meeting with Wiener.

Wiener always shared his theories and findings with other researchers, and credited the contributions of others. These included Soviet researchers and their findings. Wiener&#x27;s acquaintance with them caused him to be regarded with suspicion during the Cold War. He was a strong advocate of automation to improve the standard of living, and to end economic underdevelopment. His ideas became influential in India, whose government he advised during the 1950s.

After the war, Wiener became increasingly concerned with what he believed was political interference with scientific research, and the militarization of science. His article &quot;A Scientist Rebels&quot; from the January 1947 issue of &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; urged scientists to consider the ethical implications of their work. After the war, he refused to accept any government funding or to work on military projects. The way Wiener&#x27;s beliefs concerning nuclear weapons and the Cold War contrasted with those of von Neumann is the major theme of the book &quot;John Von Neumann and Norbert Wiener&quot;.

Wiener was a participant of the Macy conferences.

===Personal life===
In 1926 Wiener married Margaret Engemann, an assistant professor of modern languages at Juniata College. They had two daughters.

Wiener admitted in his autobiography &quot;I Am a Mathematician: The Later Life of a Prodigy&quot; to abusing benzadrine throughout his life without being fully aware of its dangers.

Wiener died in March 1964, aged 69, in Stockholm, from a heart attack. Wiener and his wife are buried at the Vittum Hill Cemetery in Sandwich, New Hampshire.

==Work==
Wiener was an early studier of stochastic and mathematical noise processes, contributing work relevant to electronic engineering, electronic communication, and control systems. It was Wiener&#x27;s idea to model a signal as if it were an exotic type of noise, giving it a sound mathematical basis. The example often given to students is that English text could be modeled as a random string of letters and spaces, where each letter of the alphabet (and the space) has an assigned probability. But Wiener dealt with analog signals, where such a simple example doesn&#x27;t exist. Wiener&#x27;s early work on information theory and signal processing was limited to analog signals, and was largely forgotten with the development of the digital theory.

Wiener is one of the key originators of cybernetics, a formalization of the notion of feedback, with many implications for engineering, systems control, computer science, biology, philosophy, and the organization of society. His work with cybernetics influenced Gregory Bateson and Margaret Mead, and through them, anthropology, sociology, and education.

===Wiener equation===
A simple mathematical representation of Brownian motion, the Wiener equation, named after Wiener, assumes the current velocity of a fluid particle fluctuates randomly.

===Wiener filter===
For signal processing, the Wiener filter is a filter proposed by Wiener during the 1940s and published in 1942 as a classified document. Its purpose is to reduce the amount of noise present in a signal by comparison with an estimate of the desired noiseless signal. Wiener developed the filter at the Radiation Laboratory at MIT to predict the position of German bombers from radar reflections. What emerged was a mathematical theory of great generality—a theory for predicting the future as best one can on the basis of incomplete information about the past. It was a statistical theory that included applications that did not, strictly speaking, predict the future, but only tried to remove noise. It made use of Wiener&#x27;s earlier work on integral equations and Fourier transforms.
=== Nonlinear control theory ===
Wiener studied polynomial chaos, a key piece of which is the Hermite-Laguerre expansion. This was developed in detail in &quot;Nonlinear Problems in Random Theory&quot;.

Wiener applied Hermite-Laguerre expansion to nonlinear system identification and control. Specifically, a nonlinear system can be identified by inputting a white noise process and computing the Hermite-Laguerre expansion of its output. The identified system can then be controlled.
===In mathematics ===
Wiener took a great interest in the mathematical theory of Brownian motion (named after Robert Brown) proving many results now widely known, such as the non-differentiability of the paths. Consequently, the one-dimensional version of Brownian motion was named the Wiener process. It is the best known of the Lévy processes, càdlàg stochastic processes with stationary statistically independent increments, and occurs frequently in pure and applied mathematics, physics and economics (e.g. on the stock-market).

Wiener&#x27;s tauberian theorem, a 1932 result of Wiener, developed Tauberian theorems in summability theory, on the face of it a chapter of real analysis, by showing that most of the known results could be encapsulated in a principle taken from harmonic analysis. In its present formulation, the theorem of Wiener does not have any obvious association with Tauberian theorems, which deal with infinite series; the translation from results formulated for integrals, or using the language of functional analysis and Banach algebras, is however a relatively routine process.

The Paley–Wiener theorem relates growth properties of entire functions on Cn and Fourier transformation of Schwartz distributions of compact support.

The Wiener–Khinchin theorem, (also known as the &quot;Wiener – Khintchine theorem&quot; and the &quot;Khinchin – Kolmogorov theorem&quot;), states that the power spectral density of a wide-sense-stationary random process is the Fourier transform of the corresponding autocorrelation function.

An abstract Wiener space is a mathematical object in measure theory, used to construct a &quot;decent&quot;, strictly positive and locally finite measure on an infinite-dimensional vector space. Wiener&#x27;s original construction only applied to the space of real-valued continuous paths on the unit interval, known as classical Wiener space. Leonard Gross provided the generalization to the case of a general separable Banach space.

The notion of a Banach space itself was discovered independently by both Wiener and Stefan Banach at around the same time.

==In popular culture==

A flagship named after him appears briefly in &quot;Citizen of the Galaxy&quot; by Robert Heinlein.
