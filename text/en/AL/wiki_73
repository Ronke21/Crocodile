<text>The Siamese cat (; แมวสยาม, Maeo Sayam) is one of the first distinctly recognised breeds of Asian cat. It derives from the Wichianmat landrace. The Siamese cat is one of several varieties of cats native to Thailand (known as Siam before 1939). The original Siamese became one of the most popular breeds in Europe and North America in the 19th century. Siamese cats have a distinctive colourpoint coat, resulting from a temperature-sensitive type of albinism. 

Distinct features like blue almond-shaped eyes, a triangular head shape, large ears, an elongated, slender, and muscular body, and various forms of point colouration characterise the modern-style Siamese. The modern-style Siamese&#x27;s point-colouration resembles the &quot;old-style&quot; foundation stock. The &quot;old-style&quot; Siamese have a round head and body. They have been re-established by multiple registries as the Thai cat. Siamese and Thai cats are selectively bred and pedigreed in multiple cat fancier and breeder organisations. The terms &quot;Siamese&quot; or &quot;Thai&quot; are used for cats from this specific breed, which are by definition all purebred cats with a known and formally registered ancestry. The ancestry registration is the cat&#x27;s pedigree or &quot;paperwork&quot;.

The Siamese is a part of the foundation stock for crossbreeding with other cats. The crossbreeding resulted in many different types of cats, like the Oriental Shorthair and Colourpoint Shorthair. The Oriental Shorthair and Colourpoint Shorthair were developed to expand the range of coat patterns. The breeding of the Oriental and Colourpoint Shorthairs resulted in a long-haired variant called the Himalayan. The long-haired Siamese is recognised internationally as a Balinese cat. The breeding also created the hair-mutation breeds, including the Cornish Rex, Sphynx, Peterbald, and blue-point Siamese cat.

==History==
===Origins===
====Thailand====
A description and depiction of the Wichianmat (Siamese cat) first appears in a collection of ancient manuscripts called the &quot;Tamra Maew&quot; (The Cat-Book Poems), thought to originate from the Ayutthaya Kingdom (1351 to 1767 AD). Over a dozen are now kept in the National Library of Thailand. The manuscripts have resurfaced outside of Thailand and are now in the British Library and National Library of Australia. 

At the end of the Burmese–Siamese war, the capitol was sacked on 7 April 1767. The Burmese army burned everything in sight and returned to Burma, taking Siamese noblemen and royal family members with them as captives. A Thai legend states that the King of Burma Hsinbyushin found and read the poem for the Thai cats in the Tamra Maew. The poem describes Thai cats as being as rare as gold, and anyone who owns this cat will become wealthy. He told his army to round up all the Suphalak cats and bring them back to Burma along with the other treasures. Today in Thailand, people tell this legend as a humorous explanation of the rarity of Thai cats.

====Siamese====
The pointed cat known in the West as &quot;Siamese&quot;, recognised for its distinctive markings, is one of several breeds of cats from Siam described and illustrated in manuscripts called &quot;Tamra Maew&quot; (Cat Poems). The &quot;Tamra Maew&quot; is estimated to have been written from the 14th to the 18th century. In 1878, U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes received the first documented Siamese to reach the United States. The cat, named &quot;Siam,&quot; was sent from Bangkok to the American Consul. 
 In 1884, the British Consul-General in Bangkok, Edward Blencowe Gould (1847–1916), brought a breeding pair of the cats, Pho and Mia, back to Britain as a gift for his sister, Lilian Jane Gould (who, married in 1895 as Lilian Jane Veley, went on to co-found the Siamese Cat Club in 1901). In 1885, Gould&#x27;s UK cats Pho and Mia produced three Siamese kittens—Duen Ngai, Kalohom, and Khromata—who were shown with their parents that same year at London&#x27;s Crystal Palace Show. Their appearance and behaviour attracted attention, but all three of the kittens died soon after the show, their cause of death not documented.

By 1886, four Siamese cats were imported to the UK by Eva Forestier Walker (surnamed Vyvyan after 1887 marriage) and her sister, Ada. These Siamese imports were long, had rounded heads with wedge-shaped muzzles, and large ears . The cats ranged from substantial to slender but were not either extreme. The difference in the pointed coat pattern had not been seen before in cats by Westerners. Over the next several years, fanciers imported a small number of cats, forming the base breeding pool for the entire breed in Britain. It is believed that most Siamese in Britain today are descended from about eleven of these original imports. In Britain, they were called the &quot;Royal Cat of Siam.&quot; Some reports say that they had previously been kept only by Siamese royalty. Research does not show evidence of any organised royal breeding programme in Siam. 

===Traditional Siamese versus modern development===
In the 1950s–1960s, as the Siamese was increasing in popularity, many breeders and cat show judges began to favour the more slender look. Breeders created increasingly long, fine-boned, narrow-headed cats through generations of selective breeding. Eventually, the modern show Siamese was bred to be extremely elongated, with a lean, tubular body, long, slender legs, a very long, very thin tail that tapers gradually into a point, and a long, wedge-shaped head topped by extremely large, wide-set ears.

By the mid-1980s, cats of the original style had largely disappeared from cat shows. Still, a few breeders, particularly in the UK, continued to breed and register them, resulting in today&#x27;s two types of Siamese: the modern, &quot;show-style&quot;, standardised Siamese, and the &quot;Traditional Siamese&quot;, both descended from the same distant ancestors, but with few or no recent ancestors in common, and effectively forming distinct sub-breeds, with some pressure to separate them.

In addition to the modern Siamese breed category, The International Cat Association (TICA) and the World Cat Federation (WCF) now accept Siamese cats of the less extreme type, and any &quot;wichianmat&quot; cat imported directly from Thailand, under the new breed name Thai. Other, mostly unofficial, names for the traditional variety are &quot;Old-style Siamese&quot; and &quot;Classic Siamese&quot;, with an American variation nicknamed &quot;Applehead&quot;.

==Appearance==
The breed standard of the modern Siamese calls for an elongated, tubular, and muscular body and a triangular head, forming a triangle from the tip of the nose to each tip of the ear. The eyes are almond-shaped and light blue, while the ears are large, wide-based, and positioned more towards the side of the head. The breed has a long neck, a slender tail, and fur that is short, glossy, fine and adheres to the body with no undercoat. Its pointed colour scheme and blue eyes distinguish it from the closely related Oriental Shorthair. The modern Siamese shares the pointed colour pattern with the Thai, or traditional Siamese, but they differ in head and body type.

The pointed pattern is a form of partial albinism, resulting from a mutation in tyrosinase, an enzyme involved in melanin production. The mutated tyrosinase enzyme is heat-sensitive; it fails to work at normal body temperatures but becomes active in cooler (&lt; 33 °C) areas of the skin. The heat-sensitive enzyme results in a dark colouration in the coolest parts of the cat&#x27;s body, like the extremities and the face, which are cooled by the airflow through their sinuses. Siamese kittens are cream or white at birth and develop visible points in the first few months of life in colder parts of their body. By the time a kitten is four weeks old, the points should be sufficiently distinguishable to recognise which colour they are.

Siamese cats tend to darken with age, and generally, adult Siamese living in warm climates have lighter coats than those in cool climates. Originally the vast majority of Siamese had seal (extremely dark brown, almost black) points, but occasionally Siamese was born with &quot;blue&quot; (a cool grey) points, genetically a dilution of seal point; chocolate (lighter brown) points, a genetic variation of seal point; or lilac (pale warm grey) points, genetically a diluted chocolate. These colours were considered &quot;inferior&quot; seal points and were not qualified for showing or breeding. These shades were eventually accepted by the breed associations and became more common through breeding programmes specifically aimed at producing these colours. Later, outcrosses with other breeds developed Siamese-mix cats with points in other cat colours and patterns, including red and cream points, lynx (tabby) points, and tortoise-shell (&quot;tortie&quot;) points. 

In the United Kingdom, all pointed Siamese-style cats are considered part of the Siamese breed. The Cat Fanciers&#x27; Association, considers only the four original fur colours as Siamese:
* seal point, 
* blue point, 
* the chocolate point, and
* lilac point.

Oriental Shorthair cats with colour points in colours or patterns aside from these four are considered Colourpoint Shorthair in that registry. The World Cat Federation has also adopted this classification, treating the Colourpoint Shorthair as a distinct breed.

Many Siamese cats from Thailand had a kink in their tails, but over the years, this trait has been considered a flaw. Breeders have largely eradicated it, but the kinked tail persists among street cats in Thailand.

==Temperament==
Siamese are usually very affectionate and intelligent cats, renowned for their social nature. Many enjoy being with people and are sometimes described as &quot;extroverts&quot;. Often they bond strongly with a single person. Myrna Milani describes the Siamese as being more diurnal, more likely to stay close to their owner, and less likely to hunt than other cats.

==Health==
Based on Swedish insurance data, which tracked cats only up to 12.5 years, Siamese and Siamese-derived breeds have a higher mortality rate than other breeds. 68% lived to 10 years or more and 42% to 12.5 years or more. The majority of deaths were caused by neoplasms, mainly mammary tumours. The Siamese also has a higher rate of morbidity. They are at higher risk of neoplastic and gastrointestinal problems but have a lower risk of feline lower urinary tract disease. A UK study of veterinary records found a life expectancy of 11.69 years for the Siamese compared with 11.74 years overall.

The Siamese has been found to have a predisposition to progressive retinal atrophy.

The same albino allele that produces coloured points means that Siamese cats&#x27; blue eyes lack a &quot;tapetum lucidum&quot;, a structure which amplifies dim light in the eyes of other cats. The mutation in the tyrosinase also results in abnormal neurological connections between the eye and the brain. The optic chiasm has abnormal uncrossed wiring; many early Siamese were cross-eyed to compensate, but like the kinked tails, the crossed eyes have been seen as a fault, and due to selective breeding the trait is far less common today. Still, this lack of a &quot;tapetum lucidum&quot; even in uncross-eyed cats, causes reduced vision for the cat at night. This trait makes them vulnerable to urban dangers such as night-time vehicular traffic. Unlike many other blue-eyed white cats, Siamese cats do not have reduced hearing ability.

The Siamese suffers from abnormal visual projections due to the lateral geniculate body of the eye differing from normal felines. Fibres located in the temporal retina cross over in the chiasm instead of remaining uncrossed.

The Siamese is predisposed to periocular leukotrichia, pinnal alopecia, and psychogenic alopecia.

Young Siamese cats are predisposed to histiocytic cutaneous mast cell tumours.

The Siamese is one of the more commonly affected breeds for gangliosidosis 1. An autosomal recessive mutation in the GBL1 gene is responsible for the condition in the breed.

==Breeds derived from the Siamese==



* Balinese – Natural mutation of the Siamese cat; a longhaired Siamese. In the largest US registry, the Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) is limited to the four traditional Siamese coat colours of seal point, blue point (a dilute of seal point), chocolate point, and lilac point (a dilute of the chocolate point). Other registries in the US and worldwide recognise a greater diversity of colours.
* Birman – After almost all the individuals of the breed died out during the years of World War II, French breeders reconstructed the breed through interbreeding with various other breeds, including the Siamese. Modern Birman cats have inherited their pointed coat patterns from the Siamese.
* Burmese – is a breed of domesticated cats descended from a specific cat, Wong Mau, who was found in Burma in 1930 by Joseph Cheesman Thompson. She was brought to San Francisco, where she was bred with Siamese.
* Havana Brown – resulted from crossing a chocolate-point Siamese with a black cat.
* Colourpoint Shorthair – a Siamese-type cat registered in CFA with pointed coat colours aside from the traditional CFA Siamese coat colours; originally developed by crosses with other shorthair cats. Considered part of the Siamese breed in most cat associations but considered a separate breed in CFA and WCF. Variations can include lynx points and tortie points.
* Himalayan – Longhaired breed originally derived from crosses of Persians to Siamese and pointed domestic longhair cats to introduce the point markings and the colours chocolate and lilac. After these initial crosses were used to introduce the colours, further breed development was performed by crossing these cats to the Persian breed. In Europe, they are referred to as colourpoint Persians. In CFA, they are a colour division of the Persian breed.
* Javanese – in CFA, a longhaired version of the Colourpoint Shorthair (i.e. a &quot;Colourpoint Longhair&quot;). In WCF, &quot;Javanese&quot; is an alias of the Oriental Longhair.
* Neva Masquerade – derived in Russia by naturally or selectively crossing Siberian cats with Siamese cats or related colourpoint cats. It bears the Siamese colourpoint gene, but the original foundation stock is unclear.
* Ocicat – a spotted cat originally produced by a cross between Siamese and Abyssinian.
* Oriental Shorthair – a Siamese-style cat in non-pointed coat patterns and colours, including solid, tabby, silver/smoke, and tortoise-shell.
* Oriental Longhair – a longhaired version of the Oriental Shorthair. 
* Ragdoll – selectively bred from &quot;alley cats&quot; foundation stock in the USA. It bears the Siamese colourpoint mutation gene. 
* Savannah – The Savannah is a domestic hybrid cat breed. It is a hybridisation between a serval and a domestic cat. (The first was bred with a Siamese)
* Snowshoe – a cream and white breed with blue eyes and some points that were produced through the cross-breeding of the Siamese and bi-coloured American Shorthair in the 1960s.
* Thai Cat – also called the Wichian Mat or Old-Style Siamese, the original type of Siamese imported from Thailand in the 19th century and still bred in Thailand today; and throughout the first half of the 20th century, the only type of Siamese.
* Tonkinese – originally a cross between a Siamese cat and a Burmese. Tonkinese × Tonkinese matings can produce kittens with a Burmese sepia pattern, a Siamese pointed pattern, or a Tonkinese mink pattern (which is something in between the first two, with less pattern contrast than the Siamese but greater than the Burmese); often with aqua eyes.
* Toybob – cat breed of Russian origin. It bears the Siamese colourpoint mutation gene. 
* Mekong Bobtail (Thai Bobtail)

==In media, literature and film==
Siamese cats have been protagonists in literature and film for adults and children since the 1930s. Clare Turlay Newberry&#x27;s &quot;Babette&quot; features a Siamese kitten escaping from a New York apartment in 1937. British publisher Michael Joseph recorded his relationship with his Siamese cat in &quot;Charles: The Story of a Friendship&quot; (1943). The &quot;Siamese Cat Song&quot; sequence (&quot;We are Siamese if you please&quot;) in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Lady and the Tramp&quot; (1955), features the cats &quot;Si&quot; and &quot;Am&quot;, both titled after the former name of Thailand, where the breed originated. The 1958 film adaptation of &quot;Bell, Book and Candle&quot; features Kim Novak&#x27;s Siamese cat &quot;Pyewacket&quot;, a witch&#x27;s familiar. 

&quot;The Incredible Journey&quot; (1961) by Sheila Burnford tells the story of three pets, including the Siamese cat &quot;Tao&quot;, as they travel through the Canadian wilderness searching for their beloved masters. The book was a modest success when first published but became widely known after 1963 when it was loosely adapted into a film of the same name by Walt Disney. Disney also employed the same Siamese in the role of &quot;DC&quot; for its 1965 crime caper &quot;That Darn Cat!&quot;, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; commenting &quot;The feline that plays the informant, as the F.B.I. puts it, is superb. [...] This elegant, blue-eyed creature is a paragon of suavity and grace&quot;.

<text>In finance, speculation is the purchase of an asset (a commodity, goods, or real estate) with the hope that it will become more valuable shortly. It can also refer to short sales in which the speculator hopes for a decline in value.
Many speculators pay little attention to the fundamental value of a security and instead focus purely on price movements. In principle, speculation can involve any tradable good or financial instrument. Speculators are particularly common in the markets for stocks, bonds, commodity futures, currencies, cryptocurrency, fine art, collectibles, real estate, and financial derivatives.

Speculators play one of four primary roles in financial markets, along with hedgers, who engage in transactions to offset some other pre-existing risk, arbitrageurs who seek to profit from situations where fungible instruments trade at different prices in different market segments, and investors who seek profit through long-term ownership of an instrument&#x27;s underlying attributes.

== History ==
With the appearance of the stock ticker machine in 1867, which removed the need for traders to be physically present on the stock exchange floor, stock speculation underwent a dramatic expansion through the end of the 1920s. The number of shareholders increased, perhaps, from in 1900 to in 1932.

== Speculation vs. investment ==

The view of what distinguishes investment from speculation and speculation from excessive speculation varies widely among pundits, legislators and academics. Some sources note that speculation is simply a higher-risk form of investment. Others define speculation more narrowly as positions not characterized as hedging. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission defines a speculator as &quot;a trader who does not hedge, but who trades with the objective of achieving profits through the successful anticipation of price movements&quot;. The agency emphasizes that speculators serve important market functions, but defines excessive speculation as harmful to the proper functioning of futures markets.

According to Benjamin Graham in &quot;The Intelligent Investor&quot;, the prototypical defensive investor is &quot;one interested chiefly in safety plus freedom from bother&quot;. He adds that &quot;some speculation is necessary and unavoidable, for, in many common-stock situations, there are substantial possibilities of both profit and loss, and the risks therein must be assumed by someone.&quot; Thus, many long-term investors, even those who buy and hold for decades, may be classified as speculators, excepting only the rare few who are primarily motivated by income or safety of principal and not eventually selling at a profit.

==Economic benefits==

===Sustainable consumption level===

Nicholas Kaldor has long argued for the price-stabilizing role of speculators, who tend to even out &quot;price-fluctuations due to changes in the conditions of demand or supply&quot;, by possessing &quot;better than average foresight&quot;. This view was later echoed by the speculator Victor Niederhoffer, in &quot;The Speculator as Hero&quot;, who describes the benefits of speculation:
Let&#x27;s consider some of the principles that explain the causes of shortages and surpluses and the role of speculators. When a harvest is too small to satisfy consumption at its normal rate, speculators come in, hoping to profit from the scarcity by buying. Their purchases raise the price, thereby checking consumption so that the smaller supply will last longer. Producers encouraged by the high price further lessen the shortage by growing or importing to reduce the shortage. On the other side, when the price is higher than the speculators think the facts warrant, they sell. This reduces prices, encouraging consumption and exports and helping to reduce the surplus.
Another service provided by speculators to a market is that by risking their own capital in the hope of profit, they add liquidity to the market and make it easier or even possible for others to offset risk, including those who may be classified as hedgers and arbitrageurs.

===Market liquidity and efficiency===
If any market, such as pork bellies, had no speculators, only producers (hog farmers) and consumers (butchers, etc.) would participate. With fewer players in the market, there would be a larger spread between the current bid and the asking price of pork bellies. Any new entrant in the market who wanted to trade pork bellies would be forced to accept this illiquid market and might trade at market prices with large bid–ask spreads or even face difficulty finding a co-party to buy or sell to.

By contrast, a commodity speculator may profit from the difference in the spread and, in competition with other speculators, reduce the spread. Some schools of thought argue that speculators increase the liquidity in a market, and therefore promote an efficient market. This efficiency is difficult to achieve without speculators. Speculators take information and speculate on how it affects prices, producers and consumers, who may want to hedge their risks, needing counterparties if they could find each other without markets it certainly would happen as it would be cheaper. A very beneficial by-product of speculation for the economy is price discovery.

On the other hand, as more speculators participate in a market, underlying real demand and supply can diminish compared to trading volume, and prices may become distorted.

===Bearing risks===
Speculators perform a risk-bearing role that can be beneficial to society. For example, a farmer might consider planting corn on unused farmland. However, he might not want to do so because he is concerned that the price might fall too far by harvest time. By selling his crop in advance at a fixed price to a speculator, he can now hedge the price risk and plant the corn. Thus, speculators can increase production through their willingness to take on risk (not at the loss of profit).

===Finding environmental and other risks===

Speculative hedge funds that do fundamental analysis &quot;are far more likely than other investors to try to identify a firm&#x27;s off-balance-sheet exposures&quot; including &quot;environmental or social liabilities present in a market or company but not explicitly accounted for in traditional numeric valuation or mainstream investor analysis&quot;. Hence, they make the prices better reflect the true quality of operation of the firms.

===Shorting===
Shorting may act as a &quot;canary in a coal mine&quot; to stop unsustainable practices earlier and thus reduce damages and form market bubbles.

== Economic disadvantages ==

=== Winner&#x27;s curse ===

Auctions are a method of squeezing out speculators from a transaction, but they may have their own perverse effects by the winner&#x27;s curse. The winner&#x27;s curse is, however, not very significant to markets with high liquidity for both buyers and sellers, as the auction for selling the product and the auction for buying the product occur simultaneously, and the two prices are separated only by a relatively small spread. That mechanism prevents the winner&#x27;s curse phenomenon from causing mispricing to any degree greater than the spread.

=== Economic bubbles ===
Speculation is often associated with economic bubbles. A bubble occurs when the price for an asset exceeds its intrinsic value by a significant margin, although not all bubbles occur due to speculation. Speculative bubbles are characterized by rapid market expansion driven by word-of-mouth feedback loops, as initial rises in asset price attract new buyers and generate further inflation. The growth of the bubble is followed by a precipitous collapse fueled by the same phenomenon. Speculative bubbles are essentially social epidemics whose contagion is mediated by the structure of the market. Some economists link asset price movements within a bubble to fundamental economic factors such as cash flows and discount rates.

In 1936, John Maynard Keynes wrote: &quot;Speculators may do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of enterprise. But the situation is serious when enterprise becomes the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation. (1936:159)&quot; Keynes himself enjoyed speculation to the fullest, running an early precursor of a hedge fund. As the Bursar of the Cambridge University King&#x27;s College, he managed two investment funds, one of which, called Chest Fund, invested not only in the then &#x27;emerging&#x27; market US stocks, but to a smaller extent periodically included commodity futures and foreign currencies (see Chua and Woodward, 1983). His fund was profitable almost every year, averaging 13% per year, even during the Great Depression, thanks to very modern investment strategies, which included inter-market diversification (it invested in stocks, commodities and currencies) as well as shorting (selling borrowed stocks or futures to profit from falling prices), which Keynes advocated among the principles of successful investment in his 1933 report: &quot;a balanced investment position... and if possible, opposed risks&quot;.

It is controversial whether the presence of speculators increases or decreases short-term volatility in a market. Their provision of capital and information may help stabilize prices closer to their true values. On the other hand, crowd behavior and positive feedback loops in market participants may also increase volatility.

== Government responses and regulation ==
The economic disadvantages of speculation have resulted in a number of attempts over the years to introduce regulations and restrictions to try to limit or reduce the impact of speculators. States often enact such financial regulation in response to a crisis. Note for example the Bubble Act 1720, which the British government passed at the height of the South Sea Bubble to try to stop speculation in such schemes. It remained in place for over a hundred years until repealed in 1825. The Glass–Steagall Act passed in 1933 during the Great Depression in the United States provides another example; most of the Glass-Steagall provisions were repealed during the 1980s and 1990s. The Onion Futures Act bans the trading of futures contracts on onions in the United States, after speculators successfully cornered the market in the mid-1950s; it remains in effect .

The Soviet Union regarded any form of private trade with the intent of gaining profit as speculation () and a criminal offense and punished speculators accordingly with fines, imprisonment, confiscation and/or corrective labor. Speculation was specifically defined in article 154 of the Penal Code of the USSR.

=== Food security ===

Some nations have moved to limit foreign ownership of cropland to ensure that food is available for local consumption, while others have leased food land abroad despite receiving aid from the World Food Programme.

In 1935, the Indian government passed a law allowing the government partial restriction and direct control of food production (Defence of India Act, 1935). It included the ability to restrict or ban the trading in derivatives on food commodities. After achieving independence in 1947, India in the 1950s continued to struggle with feeding its population and the government increasingly restricted trading in food commodities. Just at the time the Forward Markets Commission was established in 1953, the government felt that derivative markets increased speculation, which led to increased food costs and price instabilities. In 1953 it finally prohibited options- and futures-trading altogether. The restrictions were not lifted until the 1980s.

=== Regulations ===
In the United States, following passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has proposed regulations aimed at limiting speculation in futures markets by instituting position limits. The CFTC offers three basic elements for their regulatory framework: &quot;the size (or levels) of the limits themselves; the exemptions from the limits (for example, hedged positions) and; the policy on aggregating accounts for purposes of applying the limits&quot;. The proposed position limits would apply to 28 physical commodities traded in various exchanges across the US.

Another part of the Dodd-Frank Act established the Volcker Rule, which deals with speculative investments of banks that do not benefit their customers. Passed on 21 January 2010, it states that those investments played a key role in the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

=== Proposals ===

Proposals made in the past to try to limit speculation – but never enacted – included:
* The Tobin tax is a tax intended to reduce short-term currency speculation, ostensibly to stabilize foreign exchange.
* In May 2008, German leaders planned to propose a worldwide ban on oil trading by speculators, blaming the 2008 oil price rises on manipulation by hedge funds.
* On 3 December 2009, Representative Peter DeFazio, who blamed &quot;reckless speculation&quot; for the 2007–2008 financial crisis, proposed the introduction of a financial transaction tax, which would have specifically targeted speculators by taxing financial-market securities transactions.

<text>Piet Pieterszoon Hein (25 November 1577 – 18 June 1629) was a Dutch admiral and privateer for the Dutch Republic during the Eighty Years&#x27; War. Hein was the first and the last to capture a large part of a Spanish treasure fleet which transported huge amounts of gold and silver from Spanish America to Spain. The amount of silver taken was so large that it resulted in the rise of the price of silver worldwide and the near bankruptcy of Spain.

== Early life ==
Hein was born in Delfshaven (now part of Rotterdam), the son of a sea captain, and he became a sailor while he was still a teenager. During his first journeys he suffered from extreme motion sickness. In his twenties, he was captured by the Spanish, and served as a galley slave for about four years, probably between 1598 and 1602, when he was traded for Spanish prisoners. Between 1603 and 1607, he was again held captive by the Spanish, when captured near Cuba.

== Naval career ==

=== Dutch East India Company ===
In 1607, he joined the Dutch East India Company and left for Asia, returning with the rank of captain (of the &quot;Hollandia&quot;) five years later. He married Anneke Claesdochter de Reus and settled in Rotterdam. In 1618, when he was captain of the &quot;Neptunus&quot;, both he and his ship were pressed into service by the Republic of Venice. In 1621, he left his vessel behind and traveled overland to the Netherlands.

For a year in 1622, he was a member of the local government of Rotterdam, although he did not have citizenship of this city: the cousin of his wife, one of the three burgomasters, made this possible.

=== Dutch West India Company ===
After capital had been raised for the Dutch West India Company, the company&#x27;s directors, the Heeren XIX, devised the Groot Desseyn in October 1623. The plan was to first seize the capital of Brazil, São Salvador da Bahia (Salvador), and then the main Portuguese fort on the coast of Angola, São Paulo de Loanda (Luanda). In this way, the company would control both the lucrative sugar plantations in Brazil and the Atlantic slave trade. Control of the trade itself was necessary because of the high mortality rate from the plantations&#x27; harsh conditions and tropical diseases such as malaria.

In the same year Piet Hein became vice-admiral of the new Dutch West India Company, and sailed to the West Indies the following year. In Colonial Brazil, he briefly captured the Portuguese settlement of Salvador, personally leading the assault on the sea fortress of that town. In August with a small and undermanned fleet he sailed for the African west coast and attacked a Portuguese fleet in the strongly defended bay of Luanda, but failed to capture any ships.

=== Privateering activity ===
He then crossed the Atlantic Ocean again to try and capture merchant ships at the city of Vitória, but was defeated by resistance organized by the local citizenry with the assistance of the Portuguese garrison. After finding that Salvador had been recaptured by a large Spanish–Portuguese fleet, Hein returned home. The Dutch West India Company, pleased with Hein&#x27;s leadership, placed him in command of a new squadron in 1626. In subsequent raids during 1627 at Salvador, he attacked and captured over 30 richly laden Portuguese merchant ships before returning to the Dutch Republic.

=== Spanish treasure fleet ===
In 1628, during the eighty years-long Dutch war of liberation from Spain, Admiral Hein, with Witte de With as his flag captain, sailed out to capture a Spanish treasure fleet loaded with silver from the Spanish American colonies and the Philippines. With him was Admiral Hendrick Lonck. He was later joined by a squadron under Vice-Admiral Joost Banckert, as well as the pirate Moses Cohen Henriques. Part of the Spanish fleet in Venezuela had been warned because a Dutch cabin boy had lost his way on Blanquilla island and was captured and betrayed the plan, but the other half from Mexico continued on its voyage, unaware of the threat. Sixteen Spanish ships were intercepted and captured: one galleon was taken after a surprise encounter during the night, nine smaller merchants were talked into surrendering, two fleeing small ships were taken at sea, and four fleeing galleons were trapped on the Cuban coast in the Bay of Matanzas.

After some musket volleys from Dutch sloops, the crews of the galleons also surrendered and Hein captured 11,509,524 guilders of booty in gold, silver, and other expensive trade goods, such as indigo and cochineal, without any bloodshed. The Dutch did not take prisoners: they gave the Spanish crews ample supplies for a march to Havana. The released were surprised to hear the admiral personally giving them directions in fluent Spanish; Hein after all was well acquainted with the region as he had been confined to it during his internment after 1603.

The capture of the treasure fleet was the Dutch West India Company&#x27;s greatest victory in the Caribbean. It enabled the Dutch, at war with Spain, to fund their army for eight months (and as a direct consequence, allowing it to capture the fortress &#x27;s-Hertogenbosch), and the shareholders enjoyed a cash dividend of 50% for that year. The financial loss strategically weakened their Spanish enemy. Hein returned to the Netherlands in 1629, where he was hailed as a hero. Watching the crowds cheering him as he stood on the balcony of the town hall of Leyden, he remarked to the burgomaster: &quot;Now they praise me because I gained riches without the least danger; but earlier when I risked my life in full combat they didn&#x27;t even know I existed...&quot;. Hein was the first and the last to capture such a large part of a Spanish &quot;silver fleet&quot;.

=== Lieutenant-Admiral ===
He became, after a conflict with the Dutch West India Company about policy and payment, Lieutenant-Admiral of Holland and West Frisia on 26 March 1629, and thus factual supreme commander of the confederate Dutch fleet, taking as flag captain Maarten Tromp.

He died the same year, in a campaign against the Dunkirkers, the highly effective fleet of Habsburg commerce raiders and privateers operating from Dunkirk. His flotilla intercepted three privateers from Ostend. He sailed his flagship between two enemy ships to give them simultaneous broadsides. After half an hour, he was hit in the left shoulder by a cannonball and was killed instantly. He is buried in the Oude Kerk in Delft.

== Commemoration ==
The Piet Hein Tunnel in Amsterdam is named in his honor, as is the former Dutch , HNLMS &quot;Piet Heyn&quot;. A direct descendant of Hein was Piet Hein, a famous 20th century Danish mathematician, physicist and poet. A song praising Admiral Hein&#x27;s capture of the Spanish &quot;silver fleet&quot; written in 1844 is still sung by choirs and children at primary school in the Netherlands, as well as during traditional drinks by student unions in Belgian universities. A statue of him stands in his native Delfshaven, now a district in Rotterdam, and one in the Cuban city of Matanzas near where the silver fleet battle occurred.

== Rejection of slavery ==
Piet Hein rejected the slavery in the Spanish New World colonies, as the inhumane treatment of fellow human beings. Dutch historian Siebe Thissen suggests that he rejected slavery after his 10 years capture by the Spanish empire. During this capture, Hein served as a galley slave. It is unclear how this rejection of slavery fits in his activities for the Dutch West India Company, and his contributions to their Groot Desseyn.

There is an ongoing debate on the meaning of slavery within Dutch history, in which Piet Hein is an anachronistic figure head. On the one hand, some modern critiques attribute the evils of the Dutch Atlantic slave trade to him. On the other hand, he is still used as a hero figure, within a 19th-century expression of romantic idealism. In June 2020 his statue in Delfshaven was defaced.

<text>Piet Hein (16 December 1905 – 17 April 1996) was a Danish polymath (mathematician, inventor, designer, writer and poet), often writing under the Old Norse pseudonym Kumbel, meaning &quot;tombstone&quot;. His short poems, known as &quot;gruks&quot; or grooks (), first started to appear in the daily newspaper &quot;Politiken&quot; shortly after the German occupation of Denmark in April 1940 under the pseudonym &quot;Kumbel Kumbell&quot;. He also invented the Soma cube and the board game Hex.

==Biography==
Hein, a direct descendant of Piet Pieterszoon Hein, the 17th century Dutch naval figure, was born in Copenhagen, Denmark. He studied at the Institute for Theoretical Physics (later to become the Niels Bohr Institute) of the University of Copenhagen, and Technical University of Denmark. Yale awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1972. He died in his home on Funen, Denmark in 1996.

==Resistance==
Piet Hein, who, in his own words, &quot;played mental ping-pong&quot; with Niels Bohr in the inter-War period, found himself confronted with a dilemma when the Germans occupied Denmark. He felt that he had three choices: Do nothing, flee to neutral Sweden or join the Danish resistance movement. As he explained in 1968, &quot;Sweden was out because I am not Swedish, but Danish. I could not remain at home because, if I had, every knock at the door would have sent shivers up my spine. So, I joined the Resistance.&quot;

Taking as his first weapon the instrument with which he was most familiar, the pen, he wrote and had published his first &quot;grook&quot; (). It passed the censors who did not grasp its real meaning. The &quot;Consolation Grook&quot; reads:

&lt;poem&gt;
CONSOLATION GROOK

Losing one glove
is certainly painful,
but nothing 
 compared to the pain,
of losing one,
throwing away the other,
and finding 
 the first one again.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The Danes, however, understood its importance and soon it was found as graffiti all around the country. The deeper meaning of the grook was that even if you lose your freedom (&quot;losing one glove&quot;), do not lose your patriotism and self-respect by collaborating with the Nazis (&quot;throwing away the other&quot;), because that sense of having betrayed your country will be more painful when freedom has been found again someday.

One of Hein&#x27;s best-known grooks is &quot;A Maxim for Vikings&quot;:

&lt;poem&gt;
A MAXIM FOR VIKINGS

Here is a fact
 that should help you fight
 a bit longer:
Things that don&#x27;t act-
 ually kill you outright
 make you stronger.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Recreational mathematics==

In 1959, city planners in Stockholm, Sweden announced a design challenge for a roundabout in their city square Sergels Torg. Piet Hein&#x27;s winning proposal was based on a superellipse. He went on to use the superellipse in the design of furniture and other artifacts. He also invented a perpetual calendar called the Astro Calendar and marketed housewares based on the superellipse and its three-dimensional analog, the superegg.

He invented the Soma cube and devised the games of Hex, Tangloids, Tower, Polytaire, TacTix, Nimbi, Qrazy Qube, and Pyramystery.

Hein was a close associate of Martin Gardner and his work was frequently featured in Gardner&#x27;s Mathematical Games column in Scientific American. At the age of 95, Gardner wrote his autobiography and titled it &quot;Undiluted Hocus-Pocus&quot;. Both the title and the dedication of this book come from one of Hein&#x27;s grooks.

<doc id="63092" wikidata="Q18430" url="?curid=63092" title="Joseph Stiglitz">
<text>Joseph Eugene Stiglitz (; born February 9, 1943) is an American New Keynesian economist, a public policy analyst, political activist, and a professor at Columbia University. He is a recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (2001) and the John Bates Clark Medal (1979). He is a former senior vice president and chief economist of the World Bank. He is also a former member and chairman of the US Council of Economic Advisers. He is known for his support for the Georgist public finance theory and for his critical view of the management of globalization, of &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economists (whom he calls &quot;free-market fundamentalists&quot;), and of international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

In 2000, Stiglitz founded the Initiative for Policy Dialogue (IPD), a think tank on international development based at Columbia University. He has been a member of the Columbia faculty since 2001 and received the university&#x27;s highest academic rank (university professor) in 2003. He was the founding chair of the university&#x27;s Committee on Global Thought. He also chairs the University of Manchester&#x27;s Brooks World Poverty Institute. He was a member of the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences. In 2009, the President of the United Nations General Assembly Miguel d&#x27;Escoto Brockmann, appointed Stiglitz as the chairman of the U.N. Commission on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System, where he oversaw suggested proposals and commissioned a report on reforming the international monetary and financial system. He served as the chair of the international Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, appointed by the French President Sarkozy, which issued its report in 2010, &quot;Mismeasuring our Lives: Why GDP doesn&#x27;t add up,&quot; and currently serves as co-chair of its successor, the High Level Expert Group on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress. From 2011 to 2014, Stiglitz was the president of the International Economic Association (IEA). He presided over the organization of the IEA triennial world congress held near the Dead Sea in Jordan in June 2014.

In 2011, Stiglitz was named as one of the 100 most influential people in the world by &quot;Time&quot; magazine. Stiglitz&#x27;s work focuses on income distribution from a Georgist perspective, asset risk management, corporate governance, and international trade. He is the author of several books, the latest being &quot;The Road to Freedom (2024), People, Power, and Profits&quot; (2019), &quot;The Euro: How a Common Currency Threatens the Future of Europe&quot; (2016), &quot;The Great Divide: Unequal Societies and What We Can Do About Them&quot; (2015), &quot;Rewriting the Rules of the American Economy: An Agenda for Growth and Shared Prosperity&quot; (2015), and &quot;Creating a Learning Society: A New Approach to Growth Development and Social Progress&quot; (2014). He is also one of the 25 leading figures on the Information and Democracy Commission launched by Reporters Without Borders. According to the Open Syllabus Project, Stiglitz is the fifth most frequently cited author on college syllabi for economics courses.

==Life and career==

Stiglitz was born in Gary, Indiana into a Jewish family. His mother was Charlotte (née Fishman), a schoolteacher, and his father was Nathaniel David Stiglitz, an insurance salesman. Stiglitz attended Amherst College, where he was a National Merit Scholar, active on the debate team, and president of the student government. During his senior year at Amherst College, he studied at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he later pursued graduate work. In Summer 1965, he moved to the University of Chicago to do research under Hirofumi Uzawa who had received an NSF grant. He studied for his PhD from MIT from 1966 to 1967, during which time he also held an MIT assistant professorship. Stiglitz stated that the particular style of MIT economics suited him well, describing it as &quot;simple and concrete models, directed at answering important and relevant questions.&quot;

From 1966 to 1970 he was a research fellow at the University of Cambridge. Stiglitz initially arrived at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge as a Fulbright Scholar in 1965, and he later won a Tapp Junior Research Fellowship at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge which was instrumental in shaping his understanding of Keynes and macroeconomic theory. In subsequent years, he held academic positions at Yale, Stanford, Oxford—where he was Drummond Professor of Political Economy—and Princeton. Since 2001, Stiglitz has been a professor at Columbia University, with appointments at the Business School, the Department of Economics and the School of International and Public Affairs (SIPA), and is an editor of &quot;The Economists&#x27; Voice&quot; journal with J. Bradford DeLong and Aaron Edlin.

He teaches classes for a double-degree program between Sciences Po Paris and École Polytechnique in Economics and Public Policy. He has chaired the Brooks World Poverty Institute at the University of Manchester since 2005. Stiglitz is widely considered a New-Keynesian economist, although at least one economics journalist says his work cannot be so clearly categorized.

Stiglitz has played a number of policy roles throughout his career. He served in the Clinton administration as the chair of the President&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisers (1995–1997). At the World Bank, he served as a senior vice-president and the chief economist from 1997 to 2000. He was fired by the World Bank for expressing dissent with its policies. Stiglitz has advised American president Barack Obama, but has criticized the Obama Administration&#x27;s financial-industry rescue plan. He said whoever designed the Obama administration&#x27;s bank rescue plan is &quot;either in the pocket of the banks or they&#x27;re incompetent.&quot;

In October 2008, he was asked by the President of the United Nations General Assembly to chair a commission drafting a report on the reasons for and solutions to the 2007–2008 financial crisis. In response, the commission produced the Stiglitz Report.

On July 25, 2011, Stiglitz participated in the &quot;I Forro Social del 15M&quot; organized in Madrid, expressing his support to the 15M Movement protestors.

Stiglitz was the president of the International Economic Association from 2011 to 2014.

On September 27, 2015, the United Kingdom Labour Party announced that Stiglitz was to sit on its Economic Advisory Committee along with five other world-leading economists.

==Contributions to economics==
 After the 2018 mid-term elections in the United States, he wrote a statement about the importance of economic justice to the survival of democracy worldwide.

===Risk aversion===
After getting his Ph.D. from M.I.T. in 1967, Stiglitz co-authored one of his first papers with Michael Rothschild for the Journal of Economic Theory in 1970. Stiglitz and Rothschild built upon works by economists such as Robert Solow on the concept of risk aversion. Stiglitz and Rothschild showed three plausible definitions of a variable X being &#x27;more variable&#x27; than a variable Y were all equivalent – Y being equal to X plus noise, every risk-averse agent preferring Y to X, and Y having more weight in its tails, and that none of these were always consistent with X having a higher statistical variance than Y – a commonly used definition at the time. In a second paper, they analyzed the theoretical consequences of risk aversion in various circumstances, such as an individual&#x27;s savings decisions and a firm&#x27;s production decisions.

===Henry George theorem===
Stiglitz made early contributions to a theory of public finance stating that an optimal supply of local public goods can be funded entirely through capture of the land rents generated by those goods (when population distributions are optimal). Stiglitz dubbed this the &#x27;Henry George theorem&#x27; in reference to the radical classical economist Henry George who famously advocated for land value tax. The explanation behind Stiglitz&#x27;s finding is that rivalry for public goods takes place geographically, so competition for access to any beneficial public good will increase land values by at least as much as its outlay cost. Furthermore, Stiglitz shows that a single tax on rents is necessary to provide the optimal supply of local public investment. Stiglitz also shows how the theorem could be used to find the optimal size of a city or firm.

===Information asymmetry===
Stiglitz&#x27;s most famous research was on screening, a technique used by one economic agent to extract otherwise private information from another. It was for this contribution to the theory of information asymmetry that he shared the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics with George A. Akerlof and A. Michael Spence in 2001 &quot;for laying the foundations for the theory of markets with asymmetric information&quot;.

Much of Stiglitz&#x27;s work on information economics demonstrates situations in which incomplete information prevents markets from achieving social efficiency. His paper with Andrew Weiss showed that if banks use interest rates to infer information about borrowers&#x27; types (adverse selection effect), or to encourage their actions following borrowing (incentive effect), then credit will be rationed below the optimal level, even in a competitive market. Stiglitz and Rothschild showed that in an insurance market, firms have an incentive to undermine a &#x27;pooling equilibrium&#x27;, where all agents are offered the same full-insurance policy, by offering cheaper partial insurance that would only be attractive to the low-risk types, meaning that a competitive market can only achieve partial coverage of agents. Stiglitz and Grossman showed that trivially small information acquisition costs prevent financial markets from achieving complete informational efficiency, since agents will have an incentive to free-ride on others&#x27; information acquisition, and acquire this information indirectly by observing market prices.

=== Monopolistic competition ===

Stiglitz, together with Avinash Dixit, created a tractable model of monopolistic competition that was an alternative to traditional perfect-competition models of general equilibrium. They showed that in the presence of increasing returns to scale, the entry of firms is socially too small. The model was extended to show that when consumers have a preference for diversity, entry can be socially too large. The modeling approach was used by Paul Krugman in his analysis of the non-comparative advantage trading patterns.

===Shapiro–Stiglitz efficiency wage model===


Stiglitz also did research on efficiency wages, and helped create what became known as the &quot;Shapiro–Stiglitz model&quot; to explain why there is unemployment even in equilibrium, why wages are not bid down sufficiently by job seekers (in the absence of minimum wages) so that everyone who wants a job finds one, and to question whether the neoclassical paradigm could explain involuntary unemployment. An answer to these puzzles was proposed by Shapiro and Stiglitz in 1984: &quot;Unemployment is driven by the information structure of employment&quot;. Two basic observations undergird their analysis:

# Unlike other forms of capital, humans can choose their level of effort.
# It is costly for firms to determine how much effort workers are exerting.

Some key implications of this model are:

# Wages do not fall enough during recessions to prevent unemployment from rising. If the demand for labor falls, this lowers wages. But because wages have fallen, the probability of &#x27;shirking&#x27; (workers not exerting effort) has risen. If employment levels are to be maintained, through a sufficient lowering of wages, workers will be less productive than before through the shirking effect. As a consequence, in the model, wages do not fall enough to maintain employment levels at the previous state, because firms want to avoid excessive shirking by their workers. So, unemployment must rise during recessions, because wages are kept &#x27;too high&#x27;.
# Possible corollary: Wage sluggishness. Moving from one private cost of hiring (w∗) to another private cost of hiring (w∗∗) will require each firm to repeatedly re-optimize wages in response to shifting unemployment rate. Firms cannot cut wages until unemployment rises sufficiently (a coordination problem).

The outcome is never Pareto efficient.

# Each firm employs too few workers, because the cost of employing too many workers would be faced by the firm alone, while the cost of unemployment is shared by the firm and its competitors, indeed it is shared by all firms that pay taxes in the country. This means that firms do not &quot;internalize&quot; the &quot;external&quot; cost of unemployment they do not factor how large-scale unemployment harms society when assessing their own costs. This leads to a negative externality as marginal social cost exceeds the firm&#x27;s marginal cost (MSC = Firm&#x27;s Private Marginal Cost + Marginal External Cost of increased social unemployment)
# There are also positive externalities: each firm increases the asset value of unemployment for all other firms when they hire during recessions. By creating hypercompetitive labor markets, all firms (the winners when laborers compete) experience an increase in value. However, this effect of increased valuation is very unapparent, because the first problem (the negative externality of sub-optimal hiring) clearly dominates since the &#x27;natural rate of unemployment&#x27; is always too high.

===Practical implications of Stiglitz&#x27;s theories===
The practical implications of Stiglitz&#x27;s work in political economy and their economic policy implications have been subject to debate. Stiglitz himself has evolved his political-economic discourse over time.

As David L. Prychitko discusses in his &quot;critique&quot; to &quot;Whither Socialism?&quot;, he thought that Stiglitz seems generally correct, though it still leaves how the coercive institutions of the government should be constrained and what the relation is between the government and civil society.

==Government==
===Clinton administration===

Stiglitz joined the Clinton Administration in 1993, serving first as a member during 1993–1995, and was then appointed Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers on June 28, 1995.

Stiglitz always had a poor relationship with Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers. In 2000, Summers successfully petitioned for Stiglitz&#x27;s removal, supposedly in exchange for World Bank President James Wolfensohn&#x27;s re-appointmentan exchange that Wolfensohn denies took place. Whether Summers ever made such a blunt demand is questionable Wolfensohn claims he would &quot;have told him to *** himself&quot;.

Stiglitz resigned from the World Bank in January 2000, a month before his term expired. The Bank&#x27;s president, James Wolfensohn, announced Stiglitz&#x27;s resignation in November 1999 and also announced that Stiglitz would stay on as Special Advisor to the President, and would chair the search committee for a successor.

In this role, he continued criticism of the IMF, and, by implication, the US Treasury Department. In April 2000, in an article for &quot;The New Republic&quot;, he wrote:

Stiglitz&#x27;s protector-of-sorts at the World Bank, Wolfensohn, had privately empathized with Stiglitz&#x27;s views, but was worried for his second term, which Summers had threatened to veto. Stanley Fischer, deputy managing director of the IMF, called a special staff meeting and informed the gathering that Wolfensohn had agreed to fire Stiglitz. Meanwhile, the bank&#x27;s External Affairs department told the press that Stiglitz had not been fired; his post had merely been abolished.

In a September 19, 2008 radio interview, with Aimee Allison and Philip Maldari on Pacifica Radio&#x27;s KPFA 94.1 FM in Berkeley, United States, Stiglitz implied that President Clinton and his economic advisors would not have backed the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) had they been aware of stealth provisions, inserted by lobbyists, that they overlooked.

===Initiative for Policy Dialogue===

In July 2000, Stiglitz founded the Initiative for Policy Dialogue.

===Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress===
At the beginning of 2008, Stiglitz chaired the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, also known as the Stiglitz-Sen-Fitoussi Commission, initiated by President Sarkozy of France. The Commission held its first plenary meeting on April 22–23, 2008, in Paris. Its final report was made public on September 14, 2009.

===Commission of Experts on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System===
In 2009, Stiglitz chaired the Commission of Experts on Reforms of the International Monetary and Financial System which was convened by the President of the United Nations General Assembly &quot;to review the workings of the global financial system, including major bodies such as the World Bank and the IMF, and to suggest steps to be taken by Member States to secure a more sustainable and just global economic order&quot;. Its final report was released on September 21, 2009.

===Greek debt crisis===
In 2010, Stiglitz acted as an advisor to the Greek government during the Greek debt crisis. He appeared on Bloomberg TV for an interview on the risks of Greece defaulting, in which he stated that he was very confident that Greece would not default. He went on to say that Greece was under &quot;speculative attack&quot; and though it had &quot;short-term liquidity problems ... and would benefit from Solidarity Bonds&quot;, the country was &quot;on track to meet its obligations&quot;.

The next day, during a BBC interview, Stiglitz stated that &quot;there&#x27;s no problem of Greece or Spain meeting their interest payments&quot;. He argued nonetheless, that it would be desirable and needed for all of Europe to make a clear statement of belief in social solidarity and that they &quot;stand behind Greece&quot;. Confronted with the statement: &quot;Greece&#x27;s difficulty is that the magnitude of debt is far greater than the capacity of the economy to service&quot;, Stiglitz replied, &quot;That&#x27;s rather absurd&quot;.

In 2012, Stiglitz described the European austerity plans as a &quot;suicide-pact&quot;. In 2015, he said that the programmer of austerity in Greece had been &quot;an enormous mistake&quot;, that the International Monetary Fund, European Central Bank and the European Commission had &quot;criminal responsibility for causing a major recession&quot;. He argued that Greek debt should be written off.

===Scotland===
Since March 2012, Stiglitz has been a member of the Scottish Government&#x27;s Fiscal Commission Working Group, which oversees the work to establish a fiscal and macroeconomic framework for an independent Scotland on behalf of the Scottish Council of Economic Advisers. Together with Professors Andrew Hughes Hallett, Sir James Mirrlees and Frances Ruane, Stiglitz will &quot;advise on the establishment of a credible Fiscal Commission which entrenches financial responsibility and ensures market confidence&quot;.

===Labour Party===
In July 2015, Stiglitz endorsed Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He said: &quot;I am not surprised at all that there is a demand for a strong anti-austerity movement around increased concern about inequality. The promises of New Labour in the UK and of the Clintonites in the US have been a disappointment.&quot;

On September 27, 2015, it was announced that he had been appointed to the British Labour Party&#x27;s Economic Advisory Committee, convened by Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell and reporting to Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn, although he reportedly failed to attend the first meeting.

==Economic views==
=== Market efficiency ===
For Stiglitz, there is no such thing as an invisible hand, in the sense that free markets lead to efficiency as if guided by unseen forces. According to Stiglitz:

In an interview in 2007, Stiglitz explained further:

The preceding claim is based on Stiglitz&#x27;s 1986 paper, &quot;Externalities in Economies with Imperfect Information and Incomplete Markets&quot;, which describes a general methodology to deal with externalities and for calculating optimal corrective taxes in a general equilibrium context. In the opening remarks for his prize acceptance at Aula Magna, Stiglitz said:

===Support for anti-austerity movement in Spain===
On July 25, 2011, Stiglitz participated in the &quot;I Forro Social del 15M&quot; organized in Madrid (Spain) expressing his support for the anti-austerity movement in Spain. During an informal speech, he made a brief review of some of the problems in Europe and in the United States, the serious unemployment rate and the situation in Greece. &quot;This is an opportunity for economic contribution social measures&quot;, argued Stiglitz, who made a speech about the way authorities are handling the political exit to the crisis. He encouraged those present to respond to the ideas with good ideas. &quot;This does not work, you have to change it&quot;, he said.

===Criticism of rating agencies===
Stiglitz has been critical of rating agencies, describing them as the &quot;key culprit&quot; in the 2007–2008 financial crisis, noting &quot;they were the party that performed the alchemy that converted the securities from F-rated to A-rated. The banks could not have done what they did without the complicity of the rating agencies.&quot;

Stiglitz co-authored a paper with Peter Orszag in 2002 titled &quot;Implications of the New Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Risk-Based Capital Standard&quot; where they stated &quot;on the basis of historical experience, the risk to the government from a potential default on GSE debt is effectively zero.&quot; However, &quot;the risk-based capital standard ... may fail to reflect the probability of another Great Depression-like scenario.&quot;

===Views on risks associated with government-sponsored enterprises===
In a 2002 paper coauthored with Jonathan Orszag, and Peter R. Orszag, Stiglitz asserted &quot;the probability of default by the GSEs [Government-Sponsored Enterprises] is extremely small&quot;.

===Criticism of Trans-Pacific Partnership and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership===

Stiglitz warned that the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) presented &quot;grave risks&quot; and it &quot;serves the interests of the wealthiest.&quot;

Stiglitz also opposed the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) trade deal between the European Union (EU) and the United States, and has argued that the United Kingdom should consider its withdrawal from the EU in the 2016 referendum on the matter if TTIP passes, saying that &quot;the imposed by TTIP would be sufficiently averse to the functioning of government that it would make me think over again about whether membership of the EU was a good idea&quot;.

===Regulation===
Stiglitz argues that relying solely on business self-interest as the means of achieving the well-being of society and economic efficiency is misleading, and that instead &quot;What is needed is stronger norms, clearer understandings of what is acceptableand what is notand stronger laws and regulations to ensure that those that do not behave in ways that are consistent with these norms are held accountable&quot;.

===Land value tax (Georgism)===
Stiglitz argues that land value tax would improve the efficiency and equity of agricultural economies. Stiglitz believes that societies should rely on a generalized Henry George principle to finance public goods, protect natural resources, improve land use, and reduce the burden of rents and taxes on the poor while increasing productive capital formation. Stiglitz advocates taxing &quot;natural resource rents at as close to 100 percent as possible&quot; and that a corollary of this principle is that polluters should be taxed for &quot;activities that generate negative externalities.&quot; Stiglitz therefore asserts that land value taxation is even better than its famous advocate Henry George thought.

===Views on the eurozone===
In a September 2016 interview Stiglitz stated that &quot;the cost of keeping the Eurozone together probably exceeds the cost of breaking it up.&quot;

=== Views on free trade ===
====Advice for the eurozone countries====
In the 1990s, he wrote that &quot;countries in North America and Europe should eliminate all tariffs and quotas (protectionist measures)&quot;. He now advises the eurozone countries to control their trade balance with Germany by means of export/import certificates or &quot;trade chits&quot; (a protectionist measure).

Citing Keynesian theory, he explains that trade surpluses are harmful: &quot;John Maynard Keynes pointed out that surpluses lead to weak global aggregate demand – countries running surpluses exert a &quot;negative externality&quot; on trading partners. Indeed, Keynes believed it was surplus countries, far more than those in deficit, that posed a threat to global prosperity; he went so far as to advocate a tax on surplus countries&quot;. From the beginning of 1930, Keynes stopped believing in free trade, denounced the theory of comparative advantage (the basis of free trade) and adhered to protectionism.

Stiglitz writes: &quot;Germany&#x27;s surplus means that the rest of Europe is in deficit. And the fact that these countries import more than they export contributes to the weakness of their economies&quot;. He thinks that surplus countries are getting richer at the expense of deficit countries. He notes that the euro is the cause of this deficit and that as the trade deficit declines GDP would rise and unemployment would fall: &quot;The euro system means that Germany&#x27;s exchange rate cannot increase compared to other euro area members. If the exchange rate were to rise, Germany would have more difficulty exporting and its economic model, based on strong exports, would cease. At the same time, the rest of Europe would export more, GDP would rise, and unemployment would fall&quot;.

He also thinks that the rest of the world should impose a carbon-adjustment tax (a protectionist measure) on American exports that do not comply with global standard.

====Advice for the United States====

Contrary to Keynesian theory and these analyses on the eurozone, he argues that the United States should not rebalance the trade account, and that the country can no longer apply protectionist measures to protect or recreate the well-paying manufacturing jobs, saying: &quot;The very Americans who have been among the losers of globalization stand to be among the losers of a reversal of globalization. History cannot be put into reverse&quot;.

On the other hand, he admits that as trade deficit declines, &quot;GDP would rise and unemployment would fall&quot;, further stating: &quot;...the fact that these countries are importing more than they are exporting contributes to their weak economies.&quot; He also notes that trade deficit is correlated with loss of manufacturing jobs: the increase in the &quot;value of the dollar will lead to larger trade deficits and fewer manufacturing jobs&quot;.

Contrary to most economics historians who argue that tariffs played only a minor if any role in the Great Depression, Stiglitz, to convince the United States not to use protectionist policies, says that tariffs would be harmful to the United States economy today because it contributed to the Great Depression: &quot;Following that, U.S. exports fell by some 50 percent—contributing to our Great Depression&quot;.

He denounces the &quot;trickle-down&quot; policies of liberalism and neoliberalism (&quot;laissez-faire&quot;) However, he calls for lowering trade barriers and promoting free trade (policy of deregulation of foreign trade which is part of the &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economic model).

According to him, it is not China (which has a large trade surplus) that makes &quot;trade war&quot;, but the United States (which has a large trade deficit). He advises China to take sanctions against the United States &#x27;where it hurts economically and politically&#x27; if the US tries to raise tariffs to protect its industry, saying: &quot;For example, cutbacks in purchases by China will lead to more unemployment in congressional districts that are vulnerable, influential, or both. ... China can retaliate anywhere it chooses, such as by using trade restrictions to target jobs in the congressional districts of those who support US tariffs. ... China may be more effective in targeting its retaliation to cause acute political pain. ... It&#x27;s anybody&#x27;s guess who can stand the pain better. Will it be the US, where ordinary citizens have already suffered for so long, or China, which, despite troubled times, has managed to generate growth in excess of 6%?&quot;

Stiglitz does not want the United States to stop free trade. According to him, if China limits globalization, it will not hurt them, but if the United States stops with the process of free trade, it will be harmful. About China, according to him, if China depends less on economic globalization, it will not be negative for the country. He writes that the decline in exports from China to the U.S. may not &quot;hurt them more than it hurt us&quot; because &quot;China&#x27;s government has far more control over the country&#x27;s economy than our government has over ours; and it is moving from export dependence to a model of growth driven by domestic demand.&quot; Regarding the United States, he writes the opposite and advice to apply the opposite of the Keynesian theory of trade deficits seen earlier: &quot;Walking away from globalization may reduce our imports, but it will also reduce exports in tandem. And, almost surely, jobs will be destroyed faster than they will be created: there may even be fewer net manufacturing jobs&quot;. &quot;[The] erection of barriers to trade and the movement of people and ideas more likely than not will be one in which the U.S. almost surely will lose.&quot;

In early 2017, he wrote that &quot;the American middle class is indeed the loser of globalization&quot; (the diminution of international trade regulations as well as tariffs, taxes) and &quot;China, with its large emerging middle class, is among the big beneficiaries of globalization&quot;. &quot;Thanks to globalization, in terms of purchasing-power parity, China actually has already become the largest economy in the world in September 2015&quot;. However, contrary to what he wrote earlier, he later argued in February 2017 that the fall in wages and the disappearance of well-paid jobs in the United States, are not due to free trade or globalization, but rather are inevitable collateral damage to the march of economic progress and technological innovation: &quot;The United States can only push for advanced manufacturing, which requires higher skill sets and employs fewer people. Rising inequality, meanwhile, will continue ...&quot;. In addition, on December 5, 2017, contrary to what he wrote earlier, he wrote that the drop in wages in the United States is due to the actions of multinational companies rather than the globalization and the trade account imbalances between countries caused by free trade: &quot;It was an agenda written by and for large multinational companies, at the expense of workers&quot;.

In 2016, he said he believes that the economic situation of the United States is critical: &quot;As the economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton showed in their study published in December 2015, life expectancy among middle-age white Americans is declining, as rates of suicides, drug use, and alcoholism increase. A year later, the National Center for Health Statistics reported that life expectancy for the country as a whole has declined for the first time in more than 20 years.&quot; ... With the incomes of the bottom 90% having stagnated for close to a third of a century (and declining for a significant proportion), the health data simply confirmed that things were not going well for swaths of the country&quot;.

In June 2024, 16 Nobel Prize in Economics laureates, including Stiglitz, signed an open letter (which Stiglitz spearheaded) arguing that Donald Trump’s fiscal and trade policies coupled with efforts to limit the Federal Reserve&#x27;s independence would reignite inflation in the United States.

=== Green economy ===
Stiglitz has called for a transition to a green economy. He supported the Green New Deal. In 2019, he wrote that &quot;The Green New Deal would stimulate demand, ensuring that all available resources were used; and the transition to the green economy would likely usher in a new boom. Trump&#x27;s focus on the industries of the past, like coal, is strangling the much more sensible move to wind and solar power. More jobs by far will be created in renewable energy than will be lost in coal.&quot; Stiglitz described the climate crisis as humanity&#x27;s World War III.

=== Views on taxation ===
Stiglitz maintained the super-rich should pay taxes up to 70% to help deal with increasing inequality. Stiglitz stated a worldwide income tax rate of 70% on biggest earners &quot;would clearly make sense&quot;. Stiglitz maintained society would become more egalitarian and cohesive. Stiglitz said a wealth taxes on fortunes acquired during many generations would have a larger influence. Stiglitz maintains most billionaires acquired much of their wealth through luck. He maintains Elizabeth Warren proposing a 2% tax for people with assets of over $50 million and 3% on those with over $1 billion was &quot;very reasonable&quot; and would raise significant revenues that could improve some United States problems.

==Books==
Along with his technical economic publications (over 300 technical articles), Stiglitz is the author of books on issues from patent law to abuses in international trade.

=== &quot;Whither Socialism?&quot; (1994) ===
&quot;Whither Socialism?&quot; is based on Stiglitz&#x27;s Wicksell Lectures, presented at the Stockholm School of Economics in 1990 and presents a summary of information economics and the theory of markets with imperfect information and imperfect competition, as well as being a critique of both free market and market socialist approaches (see Roemer critique, op. cit.). Stiglitz explains how the neoclassical, or Walrasian model (&quot;Walrasian economics&quot; refers to the result of the process which has given birth to a formal representation of Adam Smith&#x27;s notion of the &quot;invisible hand&quot;, along the lines put forward by Léon Walras and encapsulated in the general equilibrium model of Arrow–Debreu), may have wrongly encouraged the belief that market socialism could work. Stiglitz proposes an alternative model, based on the information economics established by the Greenwald–Stiglitz theorems.

One of the reasons Stiglitz sees for the critical failing in the standard neoclassical model, on which market socialism was built, is its failure to consider the problems that arise from lack of perfect information and from the costs of acquiring information. He also identifies problems arising from its assumptions concerning completeness.

===&quot;Globalization and Its Discontents&quot; (2002)===
In &quot;Globalization and Its Discontents&quot;, Stiglitz argues that what are often called &quot;developing economies&quot; are, in fact, not developing at all, and puts much of the blame on the IMF.

Stiglitz stresses: &quot;Recent advances in economic theory&quot; (in part referring to his own work) &quot;have shown that whenever information is imperfect and markets are incomplete, which is to say always, and especially in developing countries, then the invisible hand works most imperfectly.&quot; As a result, Stiglitz continues, governments can improve the outcome by well-chosen interventions. Stiglitz argues that when families and firms seek to buy too little compared to what the economy can produce, governments can fight recessions and depressions by using expansionary monetary and fiscal policies to spur the demand for goods and services. At the microeconomic level, governments can regulate banks and other financial institutions to keep them sound. They can also use tax policy to steer investment into more productive industries and trade policies to allow new industries to mature to the point at which they can survive foreign competition. And governments can use a variety of devices, ranging from job creation to manpower training to welfare assistance, to put unemployed labor back to work and cushion human hardship.

Stiglitz argues that the IMF has done great damage through the economic policies it has prescribed that countries must follow in order to qualify for IMF loans, or for loans from banks and other private-sector lenders that look to the IMF to indicate whether a borrower is creditworthy. The organization and its officials, he argues, have ignored the implications of incomplete information, inadequate markets, and unworkable institutionsall of which are especially characteristic of newly developing countries. As a result, Stiglitz argues, the IMF has often called for policies that conform to textbook economics but do not make sense for the countries to which the IMF is recommending them. Stiglitz seeks to show that these policies have been disastrous for the countries that have followed them.

===&quot;The Roaring Nineties&quot; (2003)===
&quot;The Roaring Nineties&quot; is Stiglitz&#x27;s analysis of the boom and bust of the 1990s. Presented from an insider&#x27;s point of view, firstly as chair of President Clinton&#x27;s Council of Economic Advisors, and later as chief economist of the World Bank, it continues his argument on how misplaced faith in free-market ideology led to the global economic issues of today, with a perceptive focus on US policies.

===&quot;New Paradigm for Monetary Economics&quot; (2003)===
===&quot;Fair Trade for All&quot; (2005)===
In &quot;Fair Trade for All&quot;, authors Stiglitz and Andrew Charlton argue that it is important to make the trading world more development friendly. The idea is put forth that the present regime of tariffs and agricultural subsidies is dominated by the interests of former colonial powers and needs to change. The removal of the bias toward the developed world will be beneficial to both developing and developed nations. The developing world is in need of assistance, and this can only be achieved when developed nations abandon mercantilist-based priorities and work towards a more liberal world trade regime.

===&quot;Making Globalization Work&quot; (2006)===
&quot;Making Globalization Work&quot; surveys the inequities of the global economy, and the mechanisms by which developed countries exert an excessive influence over developing nations. Dr. Stiglitz argues that through tariffs, subsidies, an over-complex patent system and pollution, the world is being both economically and politically destabilized. Stiglitz argues that strong, transparent institutions are needed to address these problems. He shows how an examination of incomplete markets can make corrective government policies desirable.

Stiglitz is an exception to the general pro-globalization view of professional economists, according to economist Martin Wolf. Stiglitz argues that economic opportunities are not widely enough available, that financial crises are too costly and too frequent, and that the rich countries have done too little to address these problems. &quot;Making Globalization Work&quot; has sold more than two million copies.

===&quot;Stability with Growth&quot; (2006)===
In &quot;Stability with Growth: Macroeconomics, Liberalization and Development&quot;, Stiglitz, José Antonio Ocampo (United Nations Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, until 2007), Shari Spiegel (managing director, Initiative for Policy Dialogue IPD), Ricardo Ffrench-Davis (Main Adviser, Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean ECLAC) and Deepak Nayyar (Vice Chancellor, University of Delhi) discuss the current debates on macroeconomics, capital market liberalization and development, and develop a new framework within which one can assess alternative policies. They explain their belief that the Washington Consensus has advocated narrow goals for development (with a focus on price stability) and prescribed too few policy instruments (emphasizing monetary and fiscal policies), and places unwarranted faith in the role of markets. The new framework focuses on real stability and long-term sustainable and equitable growth, offers a variety of non-standard ways to stabilize the economy and promote growth, and accepts that market imperfections necessitate government interventions. Policy-makers have pursued stabilization goals with little concern for growth consequences, while trying to increase growth through structural reforms focused on improving economic efficiency. Moreover, structural policies, such as capital market liberalization, have had major consequences for economic stability. This book challenges these policies by arguing that stabilization policy has important consequences for long-term growth and has often been implemented with adverse consequences. The first part of the book introduces the key questions and looks at the objectives of economic policy from different perspectives. The third part presents a similar analysis for capital market liberalization.

===&quot;The Three Trillion Dollar War&quot; (2008)===
&quot;The Three Trillion Dollar War&quot; (co-authored with Linda Bilmes) examines the full cost of the Iraq War, including many hidden costs. The book also discusses the extent to which these costs will be imposed for many years to come, paying special attention to the enormous expenditures that will be required to care for very large numbers of wounded veterans. Stiglitz was openly critical of George W. Bush at the time the book was released.

===&quot;Freefall&quot; (2010)===
In &quot;Freefall: America, Free Markets, and the Sinking of the World Economy&quot;, Stiglitz discusses the causes of the 2008 recession/depression and goes on to propose reforms needed to avoid a repetition of a similar crisis, advocating government intervention and regulation in a number of areas. Among the policymakers he criticizes are George W. Bush, Larry Summers, and Barack Obama.

===&quot;The Price of Inequality&quot; (2012)===
From the jacket: As those at the top continue to enjoy the best health care, education, and benefits of wealth, they often fail to realize that, as Joseph E. Stiglitz highlights, &quot;their fate is bound up with how the other 99 percent live ... It does not have to be this way. In &quot;The Price of Inequality&quot; Stiglitz lays out a comprehensive agenda to create a more dynamic economy and fairer and more equal society&quot;

The book received the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights 2013 Book Award, given annually to the book that &quot;most faithfully and forcefully reflects Robert Kennedy&#x27;s purposes his concern for the poor and the powerless, his struggle for honest and even-handed justice, his conviction that a decent society must assure all young people a fair chance, and his faith that a free democracy can act to remedy disparities of power and opportunity.&quot;

===&quot;Creating a Learning Society: A New Approach to Growth, Development, and Social Progress&quot; (2014)===
&quot;Creating a Learning Society&quot; (co-authored with Bruce C. Greenwald) casts light on the significance of this insight for economic theory and policy. Taking as a starting point Kenneth J. Arrow&#x27;s 1962 paper &quot;Learning by Doing&quot;, they explain why the production of knowledge differs from that of other goods and why market economies alone typically do not produce and transmit knowledge efficiently. Closing knowledge gaps and helping laggards learn are central to growth and development. But creating a learning society is equally crucial if we are to sustain improved living standards in advanced countries.

===&quot;The Great Divide: Unequal Societies and What We Can Do About Them&quot; (2015)===
From the jacket: In &quot;The Great Divide&quot;, Joseph E. Stiglitz expands on the diagnosis he offered in his best-selling book &quot;The Price of Inequality&quot; and suggests ways to counter America&#x27;s growing problem. Stiglitz argues that inequality is a choice the cumulative result of unjust policies and misguided priorities.

===&quot;The Euro: How a Common Currency Threatens the Future of Europe&quot; (2016)===
From the description: &quot;Stiglitz dismantles the prevailing consensus around what ails Europe, demolishing the champions of austerity while offering a series of plans that can rescue the continent--and the world--from further devastation.&quot; According to book review aggregator Literary Hub, it received pan reviews.

===&quot;People, Power and Profits: Progressive Capitalism for an Age of Discontent&quot; (2019)===
From the jacket: Stiglitz shows how a middle-class life can once again be attainable by all. An authorities account of the predictable dangers of free market fundamentalism and the foundations of progressive capitalism, &quot;People, Power, and Profits&quot; shows us an America in crisis, but also lights a path through this challenging time.
===&quot;Measuring What Counts: The Global Movement for Well-Being&quot; (2019)===
Stiglitz and his co-authors point out that the interrelated crises of environmental degradation and human suffering of our current age demonstrate that &quot;something is fundamentally wrong with the way we assess economic performance and social progress.&quot; They argue that using GDP as the chief measure of our economic health does not provide an accurate assessment of the economy or the state of the world and the people living in it.

=== &quot;The Road to Freedom: Economics and the Good Society&quot; (2024) ===
In The Road to Freedom Stiglitz challenges the claim that neoliberalism is morally superior to its alternatives. The book is a critique of the economic theories of Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek. Stiglitz proposes that his essay is based on experimental empirical research. He is concerned that free information will reduce the production of information quality and value in our economy as artificial intelligence gathers and reproduces it.

==Papers and conferences==
Stiglitz wrote a series of papers and held a series of conferences explaining how such information uncertainties may have influence on everything from unemployment to lending shortages. As the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers during the first term of the Clinton Administration and former chief economist at the World Bank, Stiglitz was able to put some of his views into action. For example, he was an outspoken critic of quickly opening up financial markets in developing countries. These markets rely on access to good financial data and sound bankruptcy laws, but he argued that many of these countries did not have the regulatory institutions needed to ensure that the markets would operate soundly.

In July 2020, Stiglitz alongside Hamid Rashid, the chief of Global Economic Monitoring at the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, published a report, pointing out that the quantitative easing policy implemented by the US after the 2007–2008 financial crisis, had &quot;basically exported a debt bubble to developing countries&quot;.

The economic analysis of Stiglitz and Ira Regmi on the pandemic-induced inflation of 2021-2023 concluded the causes were sector supply-side disruptions and the Ukraine war effects in food and energy sectors and not from the excessive pandemic spending in the United States.

==Awards and honors==
In addition to being awarded the Nobel Memorial prize, Stiglitz has over 40 honorary doctorates and at least eight honorary professorships as well as an honorary deanship.

Stiglitz was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1983, the National Academy of Sciences in 1988, and the American Philosophical Society in 1997.

In 2009, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement presented by Awards Council member Archbishop Desmond Tutu at an awards ceremony at St. George&#x27;s Cathedral in Cape Town, South Africa.

He received the 2010 Gerald Loeb Awards for Commentary for &quot;Capitalist Fools and Wall Street&#x27;s Toxic Message&quot;.

In 2011, he was named by &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine on its list of top global thinkers. In February 2012, he was awarded the Legion of Honor, in the rank of Officer, by the French ambassador in the United States François Delattre. Stiglitz was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2009. Stiglitz was awarded the 2018 Sydney Peace Prize.

==Personal life==
Stiglitz married Jane Hannaway in 1978 but the couple later divorced. He married for the third time on October 28, 2004, to Anya Schiffrin, who works at the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University. He has four children and three grandchildren.

<text>Joan Miró i Ferrà ( , ; ; 20 April 1893 – 25 December 1983) was a Catalan Spanish painter, sculptor and ceramist. A museum dedicated to his work, the Fundació Joan Miró, was established in his native city of Barcelona in 1975, and another, the Fundació Pilar i Joan Miró, was established in his adoptive city of Palma in 1981.

Earning international acclaim, his work has been interpreted as Surrealism but with a personal style, sometimes also veering into Fauvism and Expressionism. He was notable for his interest in the unconscious or the subconscious mind, reflected in his re-creation of the childlike. His difficult-to-classify works also had a manifestation of Catalan pride. In numerous interviews dating from the 1930s onwards, Miró expressed contempt for conventional painting methods as a way of supporting bourgeois society, and declared an &quot;assassination of painting&quot; in favour of upsetting the visual elements of established painting.

==Biography==
Born into a family of a goldsmith and watchmaker, Miquel Miró Adzerias, and mother Dolores Ferrà., Miró grew up in the Barri Gòtic neighborhood of Barcelona. The &quot;Miró&quot; surname indicates some possible Jewish roots (in terms of &quot;marrano&quot; or &quot;converso&quot; Iberian Jews who converted to Christianity). He began drawing classes at the age of seven at a private school at Carrer del Regomir 13, a medieval mansion. To the dismay of his father, he enrolled at the fine art academy at La Llotja in 1907. He studied at the Cercle Artístic de Sant Lluc and he had his first solo show in 1918 at the Galeries Dalmau, where his work was ridiculed and defaced. Inspired by Fauve and Cubist exhibitions in Barcelona and abroad, Miró was drawn towards the arts community that was gathering in Montparnasse and in 1920 moved to Paris, but continued to spend his summers in Catalonia.

===Career===

Miró initially went to business school as well as art school. He began his working career as a clerk when he was a teenager, although he abandoned the business world completely for art after suffering a nervous breakdown. His early art, like that of the similarly influenced Fauves and Cubists, was inspired by Vincent van Gogh and Paul Cézanne. The resemblance of Miró&#x27;s work to that of the intermediate generation of the avant-garde has led scholars to dub this period his Catalan Fauvist period.

A few years after Miró&#x27;s 1918 Barcelona solo exhibition, he settled in Paris where he finished a number of paintings that he had begun on his parents&#x27; summer home and farm in Mont-roig del Camp. One such painting, &quot;The Farm&quot;, showed a transition to a more individual style of painting and certain nationalistic qualities. Ernest Hemingway, who later purchased the piece, described it by saying, &quot;It has in it all that you feel about Spain when you are there and all that you feel when you are away and cannot go there. No one else has been able to paint these two very opposing things.&quot; Miró annually returned to Mont-roig and developed a symbolism and nationalism that would stick with him throughout his career. Two of Miró&#x27;s first works classified as Surrealist, &quot;Catalan Landscape (The Hunter)&quot; and &quot;The Tilled Field&quot;, employ the symbolic language that was to dominate the art of the next decade.

Josep Dalmau arranged Miró&#x27;s first Parisian solo exhibition, at Galerie la Licorne in 1921.

In 1924, Miró joined the Surrealist group. The already symbolic and poetic nature of Miró&#x27;s work, as well as the dualities and contradictions inherent to it, fit well within the context of dream-like automatism espoused by the group. Much of Miró&#x27;s work lost the cluttered chaotic lack of focus that had defined his work thus far, and he experimented with collage and the process of painting within his work so as to reject the framing that traditional painting provided. This antagonistic attitude towards painting manifested itself when Miró referred to his work in 1924 ambiguously as &quot;x&quot; in a letter to poet friend Michel Leiris. The paintings that came out of this period were eventually dubbed Miró&#x27;s dream paintings.

Miró did not completely abandon subject matter, though. Despite the Surrealist automatic techniques that he employed extensively in the 1920s, sketches show that his work was often the result of a methodical process. Miró&#x27;s work rarely dipped into non-objectivity, maintaining a symbolic, schematic language. This was perhaps most prominent in the repeated &quot;Head of a Catalan Peasant&quot; series of 1924 to 1925. In 1926, he collaborated with Max Ernst on designs for ballet impresario Sergei Diaghilev.

Miró returned to a more representational form of painting with &quot;The Dutch Interiors&quot; of 1928. Crafted after works by Hendrik Martenszoon Sorgh and Jan Steen seen as postcard reproductions, the paintings reveal the influence of a trip to Holland taken by the artist. These paintings share more in common with &quot;Tilled Field&quot; or &quot;Harlequin&#x27;s Carnival&quot; than with the minimalistic dream paintings produced a few years earlier.

Miró married Pilar Juncosa in Palma (Majorca) on 12 October 1929. Their daughter, María Dolores Miró, was born on 17 July 1930. In 1931, Pierre Matisse opened an art gallery in New York City. The Pierre Matisse Gallery (which existed until Matisse&#x27;s death in 1989) became an influential part of the Modern art movement in America. From the outset Matisse represented Joan Miró and introduced his work to the United States market by frequently exhibiting Miró&#x27;s work in New York.

In 1932 he created a scenic design for Massine&#x27;s ballet &quot;&quot; at Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo.

Until the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Miró habitually returned to Spain in the summers. Once the war began, he was unable to return home. Unlike many of his surrealist contemporaries, Miró had previously preferred to stay away from explicitly political commentary in his work. Though a sense of (Catalan) nationalism pervaded his earliest surreal landscapes and &quot;Head of a Catalan Peasant&quot;, it was not until Spain&#x27;s Republican government commissioned him to paint the mural &quot;The Reaper&quot;, for the Spanish Republican Pavilion at the 1937 Paris Exhibition, that Miró&#x27;s work took on a politically charged meaning.

In 1939, with Germany&#x27;s invasion of France looming, Miró relocated to Varengeville in Normandy, and on 20 May of the following year, as Germans invaded Paris, he narrowly fled to Spain (now controlled by Francisco Franco) for the duration of the Vichy Regime&#x27;s rule. In Varengeville, Palma, and Mont-roig, between 1940 and 1941, Miró created the twenty-three gouache series &quot;Constellations&quot;. Revolving around celestial symbolism, &quot;Constellations&quot; earned the artist praise from André Breton, who seventeen years later wrote a series of poems, named after and inspired by Miró&#x27;s series. Features of this work revealed a shifting focus to the subjects of women, birds, and the moon, which would dominate his iconography for much of the rest of his career.

Shuzo Takiguchi published the first monograph on Miró in 1940. In 1948–49 Miró lived in Barcelona and made frequent visits to Paris to work on printing techniques at the Mourlot Studios and the Atelier Lacourière. He developed a close relationship with Fernand Mourlot and that resulted in the production of over one thousand different lithographic editions.

In 1959, André Breton asked Miró to represent Spain in &quot;The Homage to Surrealism&quot; exhibition alongside Enrique Tábara, Salvador Dalí, and Eugenio Granell. Miró created a series of sculptures and ceramics for the garden of the Maeght Foundation in Saint-Paul-de-Vence, France, which was completed in 1964.

In 1974, Miró created a tapestry for the World Trade Center in New York City together with the Catalan artist Josep Royo. He had initially refused to do a tapestry, then he learned the craft from Royo and the two artists produced several works together. His &quot;World Trade Center Tapestry&quot; was displayed at the building and was one of the most expensive works of art lost during the September 11 attacks.

In 1977, Miró and Royo finished a tapestry to be exhibited in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC.

In 1981, Miró&#x27;s &quot;The Sun, the Moon and One Star&quot;—later renamed &quot;Miró&#x27;s Chicago&quot;—was unveiled. This large, mixed media sculpture is situated outdoors in the downtown Loop area of Chicago, across the street from another large public sculpture, the Chicago Picasso. Miró had created a bronze model of &quot;The Sun, the Moon and One Star&quot; in 1967. The maquette now resides in the Milwaukee Art Museum.

===Late life and death===
In 1979 Miró received a doctorate &quot;honoris causa&quot; from the University of Barcelona. The artist, who suffered from heart failure, died in his home in Palma (Majorca) on 25 December 1983 at age 90. He was later interred in the Montjuïc Cemetery in Barcelona.

===Mental health ===
Miró had many episodes of depression throughout his life. He experienced his first depression when he was 18 in 1911. Miró said, &quot;I was demoralized and suffered from a serious depression. I fell really ill, and stayed three months in bed&quot;.

He used painting as a way of dealing with depression, and it supposedly made him calmer and his thoughts less dark. Miró said that without painting he became &quot;very depressed, gloomy and I get &#x27;black ideas&#x27;, and I do not know what to do with myself&quot;.

His mental state is visible in his painting &quot;Carnival of the Harlequin.&quot; He tried to paint the chaos he experienced in his mind, the desperation of wanting to leave that chaos behind and the pain created because of that. Miró painted the symbol of the ladder here which is also visible in multiple other paintings after this painting. It is supposed to symbolize escaping.

The relation between creativity and mental illness is very well studied. It has been argued that creative people have a higher chance of suffering from a manic depressive illness or schizophrenia, as well as higher chance of transmitting this genetically. Even though we know Miró suffered from episodic depression, it is uncertain whether he also experienced manic episodes, which is often referred to as bipolar disorder.

==Works==
===Early fauvist===
His early modernist works include &quot;Portrait of Vincent Nubiola&quot; (1917), &quot;Siurana (the path)&quot;, &quot;Nord-Sud&quot; (1917) and &quot;Painting of Toledo&quot;. These works show the influence of Cézanne, and fill the canvas with a colorful surface and a more painterly treatment than the hard-edge style of most of his later works. In &quot;Nord-Sud&quot;, the literary newspaper of that name appears in the still life, a compositional device common in cubist compositions, but also a reference to the literary and avant-garde interests of the painter.

===Magical realism===
Starting in 1920, Miró developed a very precise style, picking out every element in isolation and detail and arranging them in deliberate composition. These works, including &quot;House with Palm Tree&quot; (1918), &quot;Nude with a Mirror&quot; (1919), &quot;Horse, Pipe and Red Flower&quot; (1920), and &quot;The Table – Still Life with Rabbit&quot; (1920), show the clear influence of Cubism, although in a restrained way, being applied to only a portion of the subject. For example, &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1922–23), is realistic, but some sections are stylized or deformed, such as the treatment of the woman&#x27;s feet, which are enlarged and flattened.

The culmination of this style was &quot;The Farm&quot; (1921–22). The rural Catalan scene it depicts is augmented by an avant-garde French newspaper in the center, showing Miró sees this work transformed by the Modernist theories he had been exposed to in Paris. The concentration on each element as equally important was a key step towards generating a pictorial sign for each element. The background is rendered in flat or patterned in simple areas, highlighting the separation of figure and ground, which would become important in his mature style.

Miró made many attempts to promote this work, but his surrealist colleagues found it too realistic and apparently conventional, and so he soon turned to a more explicitly surrealist approach.

===Early surrealism===

In 1922, Miró explored abstracted, strongly coloured surrealism in at least one painting. From the summer of 1923 in Mont-roig, Miró began a key set of paintings where abstracted pictorial signs, rather than the realistic representations used in The Farm, are predominant. In &quot;The Tilled Field&quot;, &quot;Catalan Landscape (The Hunter)&quot; and &quot;Pastoral&quot; (1923–24), these flat shapes and lines (mostly black or strongly coloured) suggest the subjects, sometimes quite cryptically. For &quot;Catalan Landscape (The Hunter)&quot;, Miró represents the hunter with a combination of signs: a triangle for the head, curved lines for the moustache, angular lines for the body. So encoded is this work that at a later time Miró provided a precise explanation of the signs used.

===Surrealist pictorial language===
Through the mid-1920s Miró developed the pictorial sign language which would be central throughout the rest of his career.
In &quot;Harlequin&#x27;s Carnival&quot; (1924–25), there is a clear continuation of the line begun with &quot;The Tilled Field&quot;. But in subsequent works, such as &quot;The Happiness of Loving My Brunette&quot; (1925) and &quot;Painting (Fratellini)&quot; (1927), there are far fewer foreground figures, and those that remain are simplified.

Soon after, Miró also began his &quot;Spanish Dancer&quot; series of works. These simple collages, were like a conceptual counterpoint to his paintings. In &quot;Spanish Dancer&quot; (1928) he combines a cork, a feather and a hatpin onto a blank sheet of paper.

===Livres d&#x27;Artiste===
Miró created over 250 illustrated books. These were known as &quot;Livres d&#x27; Artiste.&quot; One such work was published in 1974, at the urging of the widow of the French poet Robert Desnos, titled &quot;Les pénalités de l&#x27;enfer ou les nouvelles Hébrides&quot; (&quot;The Penalties of Hell or The New Hebrides&quot;). It was a set of 25 lithographs, five in black, and the others in colors.

In 2006, the book with these collected lithos was displayed in &quot;Joan Miró, Illustrated Books&quot; at the Vero Beach Museum of Art. One critic described it as &quot;an especially powerful set, not only for the rich imagery but also for the story behind the book&#x27;s creation. The lithographs are long, narrow verticals, and while they feature Miró&#x27;s familiar shapes, there&#x27;s an unusual emphasis on texture.&quot; The critic continued, &quot;I was instantly attracted to these four prints, to an emotional lushness, that&#x27;s in contrast with the cool surfaces of so much of Miró&#x27;s work. Their poignancy is even greater, I think, when you read how they came to be. The artist met and became friends with Desnos, perhaps the most beloved and influential surrealist writer, in 1925, and before long, they made plans to collaborate on a &quot;livre d&#x27;artist[e]&quot;. Those plans were put on hold because of the Spanish civil War and World War II. Desnos&#x27; bold criticism of the latter led to his imprisonment in concentration camps [ Auschwitz ], and he died at age 45 shortly after his release in 1945.

&quot;Nearly three decades later, at the suggestion of Desnos&#x27; widow, Miró set out to illustrate the poet&#x27;s manuscript. It was his first work in prose, which was written in Morocco in 1922 but remained unpublished until this posthumous collaboration.&quot;

==Styles and development==
In Paris, under the influence of poets and writers, he developed his unique style: organic forms and flattened picture planes drawn with a sharp line. Generally thought of as a Surrealist because of his interest in automatism and the use of sexual symbols (for example, ovoids with wavy lines emanating from them), Miró&#x27;s style was influenced in varying degrees by Surrealism and Dada, yet he rejected membership in any artistic movement in the interwar European years. André Breton described him as &quot;the most Surrealist of us all.&quot; Miró confessed to creating one of his most famous works, &quot;Harlequin&#x27;s Carnival&quot;, under similar circumstances:

How did I think up my drawings and my ideas for painting? Well I&#x27;d come home to my Paris studio in Rue Blomet at night, I&#x27;d go to bed, and sometimes I hadn&#x27;t any supper. I saw things, and I jotted them down in a notebook. I saw shapes on the ceiling...

Miró&#x27;s surrealist origins evolved out of &quot;repression&quot; much like all Spanish surrealist and magic realist work, especially because of his Catalan ethnicity, which was subject to special persecution by the Franco regime. He drew on Catalan folk art such as siurells, which he claimed to &quot;observe constantly.&quot; Also, Joan Miró was well aware of Haitian Voodoo art and Cuban Santería religion through his travels before going into exile. This led to his signature style of art making.

===Experimental style===
Joan Miró was among the first artists to develop automatic drawing as a way to undo previous established techniques in painting, and thus, with André Masson, represented the beginning of Surrealism as an art movement. However, Miró chose not to become an official member of the Surrealists to be free to experiment with other artistic styles without compromising his position within the group. He pursued his own interests in the art world, ranging from automatic drawing and surrealism, to expressionism, Lyrical Abstraction, and Color Field painting. Four-dimensional painting was a theoretical type of painting Miró proposed in which painting would transcend its two-dimensionality and even the three-dimensionality of sculpture.

Miró&#x27;s oft-quoted interest in the &quot;assassination of painting&quot; is derived from a dislike of bourgeois art, which he believed was used as a way to promote propaganda and cultural identity among the wealthy. Specifically, Miró responded to Cubism in this way, which by the time of his quote had become an established art form in France. He is quoted as saying &quot;I will break their guitar,&quot; referring to Picasso&#x27;s paintings, with the intent to attack the popularity and appropriation of Picasso&#x27;s art by politics.

The spectacle of the sky overwhelms me. I&#x27;m overwhelmed when I see, in an immense sky, the crescent of the moon, or the sun. There, in my pictures, tiny forms in huge empty spaces. Empty spaces, empty horizons, empty plains – everything which is bare has always greatly impressed me. —Joan Miró, 1958, quoted in &quot;Twentieth-Century Artists on Art&quot;

In an interview with biographer Walter Erben, Miró expressed his dislike for art critics, saying, they &quot;are more concerned with being philosophers than anything else. They form a preconceived opinion, then they look at the work of art. Painting merely serves as a cloak in which to wrap their emaciated philosophical systems.&quot;

In the final decades of his life Miró accelerated his work in different media, producing hundreds of ceramics, including the &quot;Wall of the Moon&quot; and &quot;Wall of the Sun&quot; at the UNESCO building in Paris. He also made temporary window paintings (on glass) for an exhibit. In the last years of his life Miró wrote his most radical and least known ideas, exploring the possibilities of gas sculpture and four-dimensional painting.

==Exhibitions==
Throughout the 1960s, Miró was a featured artist in many salon shows assembled by the Maeght Foundation that also included works by Marc Chagall, Giacometti, Brach, Cesar, Ubac, and Tal-Coat.

The large retrospectives devoted to Miró in his old age in places like New York (1972), London (1972), Saint-Paul-de-Vence (1973) and Paris (1974) were a good indication of the international acclaim that had grown steadily over the previous half-century; further major retrospectives took place posthumously. Political changes in his native country led in 1978 to the first full exhibition of his painting and graphic work, at the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid. In 1993, the year of the hundredth anniversary of his birth, several exhibitions were held, among which the most prominent were those held in the Fundació Joan Miró, Barcelona, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía, Madrid, and the Galerie Lelong, Paris. In 2011, another retrospective was mounted by the Tate Modern, London, and travelled to Fundació Joan Miró and the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.. &quot;Joan Miró, Printmaking&quot;, Fundación Joan Miró (2013). And two exhibitions in 2014, &quot;Miró: From Earth to Sky&quot; at Albertina Museum, and &quot;Masterpieces from the Kunsthaus Zürich&quot;, National Art Center, Tokyo.

Exhibitions entitled &quot;Joan Miró: Instinct &amp; Imagination&quot; and &quot;Miró: The Experience of Seeing&quot; were held at the Denver Art Museum from 22 March – 28 June 2015 and at the McNay Art Museum from 30 September 2015 – 10 January 2016 (respectively), showing works made by Miró between 1963 and 1981, on loan from the Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofía in Madrid. In 2018, he was exhibited alongside, among others, Henri Matisse, Le Corbusier, Raymond Hains and Éric Sandillon at the Museum of Decorative Arts and Design in Riga, Latvia. This exhibition, titled &quot;Colour of Gobelins: Contemporary Gobelins from the &#x27;Mobilier national&#x27; collection in France&quot;, took place during the sixth edition of the Riga Textile Art.

In Spring 2019, the Museum of Modern Art, New York, launched &quot;Joan Miró: Birth of the World.&quot; Running until July 2019, the exhibit showcases 60 pieces of work from the inception of Miró&#x27;s career, and including the influence of the World Wars. The exhibit features 60-foot canvasses as well as smaller 8-foot paintings, and the influences range from cubism to abstraction.

==Legacy and influence==
Miró has been a significant influence on late 20th-century art, in particular the American abstract expressionist artists that include: Motherwell, Calder, Gorky, Pollock, Matta, and Rothko, while his lyrical abstractions and color field paintings were precursors of that style by artists such as Helen Frankenthaler, Olitski and Louis and others.
His work has also influenced modern designers, including Paul Rand and Lucienne Day, and influenced recent painters such as Julian Hatton.

One of Man Ray&#x27;s 1930s photographs, &quot;Miró with Rope&quot;, depicts the painter with an arranged rope pinned to a wall, and was published in the single-issue surrealist work &quot;Minotaure&quot;.

In 2002, American percussionist/composer Bobby Previte released the album &quot;The 23 Constellations of Joan Miró&quot; on Tzadik Records. Inspired by Miró&#x27;s &quot;Constellations&quot; series, Previte composed a series of short pieces (none longer than about 3 minutes) to parallel the small size of Miró&#x27;s paintings. Previte’s compositions for an ensemble of up to ten musicians was described by critics as &quot;unconventionally light, ethereal, and dreamlike&quot;.

==Recognition==
In 1954 he was given the Venice Biennale print making prize, in 1958 the Guggenheim International Award.

In 1981, the Palma City Council (Majorca) established the &quot;Fundació Pilar i Joan Miró a Mallorca&quot;, housed in the four studios that Miró had donated for the purpose.

In October 2018, the Grand Palais in Paris opened the largest retrospective devoted to the artist until this date. The exhibition included nearly 150 works and was curated by Jean Louis Prat.

==Art market==
Today, Miró&#x27;s paintings sell for between US$250,000 and US$26 million; US$17 million at a U.S. auction for the &quot;La Caresse des étoiles&quot; (1938) on 6 May 2008, at the time the highest amount paid for one of his works. In 2012, &quot;Painting-Poem (&quot;le corps de ma brune puisque je l&#x27;aime comme ma chatte habillée en vert salade comme de la grêle c&#x27;est pareil&quot;)&quot; (1925) was sold at Christie&#x27;s London for $26.6 million. Later that year at Sotheby&#x27;s in London, &quot;Peinture (Etoile Bleue)&quot; (1927) brought nearly 23.6 million pounds with fees, more than twice what it had sold for at a Paris auction in 2007 and a record price for the artist at auction. On 21 June 2017, the work &quot;Femme et Oiseaux&quot; (1940), one of his &quot;Constellations&quot;, sold at Sotheby&#x27;s London for 24,571,250 GBP.

<text>The National Book Awards (NBA) are a set of annual U.S. literary awards. At the final National Book Awards Ceremony every November, the National Book Foundation presents the National Book Awards and two lifetime achievement awards to authors. The National Book Awards were established in 1936 by the American Booksellers Association, abandoned during World War II, and re-established by three book industry organizations in 1950. Non-U.S. authors and publishers were eligible for the pre-war awards. Since then they are presented to U.S. authors for books published in the United States roughly during the award year.

The nonprofit National Book Foundation was established in 1988 to administer and enhance the National Book Awards and &quot;move beyond [them] into the fields of education and literacy&quot;, primarily by sponsoring public appearances by writers.
Its mission is &quot;to celebrate the best literature in America, expand its audience, and ensure that books have a prominent place in American culture.&quot;

In 2018, there were 1,637 books nominated for the five award categories, led by the Nonfiction category with 546 nominations. The 2018 ceremony was held on November 14 in New York City.

== Winners and finalists ==
*List of winners of the National Book Award, winners only.
*National Book Award for Fiction, winners and finalists.
*National Book Award for Nonfiction, winners and finalists.
*National Book Award for Poetry, winners and finalists.
*National Book Award for Translated Literature, winners and finalists.
*National Book Award for Young People&#x27;s Literature, winners and finalists.

== Process ==
National Book Awards are given to one book (author) annually in each of five categories: fiction, nonfiction, poetry, translation, and young people&#x27;s literature. There have previously been many other categories but they have been retired or subsumed in the existing five. The National Book Foundation also presents two lifetime achievement awards each year: the &quot;Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters&quot; and the &quot;Literarian Award for Outstanding Service to the American Literary Community&quot;.

Only publishers nominate books for the National Book Awards, but panelists may request particular nominations from publishers. Each panel comprises five judges, including writers, librarians, booksellers, and literary critics. In 2013, the judging panels were expanded to include experts in the literary field in addition to established writers.

Each panel considers hundreds of books each year in each of the five categories. In 2013, the Foundation announced the addition of a National Book Awards longlist—announced in September and consisting of ten titles per category—to precede the finalists list, announced in October and comprising five titles per category. The fifth category, the National Book Award for Translated Literature, was added in 2018, recognizing works in translation for the first time since 1983. At the National Book Awards Ceremony and Dinner held in New York City each November, the chair of each judging panel announces the winners of the year&#x27;s National Book Awards. Each finalist receives $1,000, a medal, and a citation written by the judging panel; winners get $10,000 and a bronze sculpture.

== History ==

=== Pre-war awards by booksellers ===
The first National Book Awards were presented in May 1936 at the annual convention of the American Booksellers Association, one month after &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported institution of the &quot;new annual award&quot;. The winners were authors of four 1935 books selected by a vote of ABA members. Virginia Kirkus chaired the central committee of seven including the ABA president, three bookshops, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot;, and American News Company. Three were called &quot;the most distinguished of 1935&quot; (novel, biography, and general nonfiction) and one &quot;the most original&quot; (novel).
Two of the books were advertised by their publishers as &quot;The most distinguished autobiography of 1935&quot; and &quot;The most distinguished general non-fiction book of 1935&quot; in &quot;NYTimes&quot; on May 12, the same day that the newspaper reported yesterday&#x27;s awards.

For the next six years, 1937 to 1942, the awards were announced from mid-February to early March.

The &quot;Most Distinguished&quot; Nonfiction, Biography, and Novel (for 1935 and 1936) were reduced to two and termed &quot;Favorite&quot; Nonfiction and Fiction beginning 1937. Master of ceremonies Clifton Fadiman declined to consider the Pulitzer Prizes (not yet announced in February 1938) as potential ratifications. &quot;Unlike the Pulitzer Prize committee, the booksellers merely vote for their favorite books. They do not say it is the best book or the one that will elevate the standard of manhood or womanhood. Twenty years from now we can decide which are the masterpieces. This year we can only decide which books we enjoyed reading the most.&quot;

The Bookseller Discovery officially recognized &quot;outstanding merit which failed to receive adequate sales and recognition&quot; (quoted by NYT)
Finally that award stood alone for 1941 and the &quot;New York Times&quot; frankly called it &quot;a sort of consolation prize that the booksellers hope will draw attention to his work.&quot;

The winning authors and books were selected by a nationwide poll of booksellers (ABA members); during the 1937/38 cycle, ballots were received from 319 stores, triple the number who voted in the first rendition early in 1936.
In a 1941 advertisement, the Booksellers described the &quot;significance of the awards&quot; thus:
In effect, his ballot says, &quot;Of all the books of the year these are the three I enjoyed most – &quot;in two ways&quot;! I enjoyed reading them; and I enjoyed selling them.&quot; And that to a bookseller means people who, on his recommendation, read and enjoyed – and sent in other people who also read and enjoyed.
The National Book Awards give you perhaps a greater guarantee of reading pleasure than any other literary prizes.

=== Reestablished by the book industry ===
In January 1950 three book industry organizations announced that &quot;works by Americans published here&quot; would be recognized by three awards in March (at the annual convention?). There would be three distinct panels of five judges. The fifteen judges were &quot;Elmer Davis, John Kieran, Henry Steele Commager, Fairfield Osborn and Norman Cousins for non-fiction; Mary Colum, Glenway Wescott, Max Gissin, W. G. Rogers and Malcolm Cowley for fiction; and W. H. Auden, Louise Bogan, Babett Duetsch, Horace Gregory and Louise Untermeyer for poetry.&quot;

The awards were administered by the National Book Committee from 1950 to 1974, when the Committee disbanded after publishers withdrew support.

In 1950 and 1967, at least, the prize sponsors were three book-industry organizations American Booksellers Association, the American Book Publishers Council and the Book Manufacturers Institute.

In 1973 NYTimes still called the National Book Committee a nonprofit funded &quot;by publishers and by organizations involved in the book trade&quot; A temporary Committee on Awards Policy handled 1975.

=== New categories and split awards ===
In 1964 Nonfiction was divided in three. The National Book Award for Translation was introduced in 1967 and split between two books, the first split.

Children&#x27;s literature was first recognized as one of seven categories in 1969. Two awards were split in 1973 for the first time.

Publishers dropped their support after 1974 and the National Book Committee was disbanded.
In 1975 the temporary administrator&quot;begged&quot; judges not to split awards.

Three of 27 awards were split in 1983
before the drastic cutback that also required selection of a single winner in all three categories for 1984.

The currently active Poetry category was added in 1991, followed by Young People&#x27;s Literature in 1996, and Translated Literature in 2018.

=== &quot;American Book Awards&quot; ===
In 1980 the &quot;National Book Awards&quot; were canceled and replaced by &quot;American Book Awards&quot; on the film industry model (Oscars). &quot;It will be run almost exactly the way the Academy Awards are run,&quot; a spokesman told reporters.&quot; There would be nearly 30 awards presented in an extravagant TV-friendly ceremony, to winners selected by a standing &quot;academy&quot; of more than 2,000 people in the book industry.
Implementation was poor, the episode a disaster.

Most new categories survived only one to four cycles, 1980 to 1983. There were seven awards categories in 1979, twenty-eight in 1980, nineteen in 1983 (plus graphics awards, see below), three in 1984.

In 1983 there were 30 award winners in 27 categories including 14 categories of literary achievement in writing for adults; in turn, five for hardcover editions, six for paperback editions, and three general.

1983 awards categories (27)
* 8 for graphics: Pictorial Design, Typographical Design, Illustration Collected Art, Illustration Original Art, Illustration Photographs, Cover Design, Jacket Design
* 5 for children&#x27;s literature: (Children&#x27;s) Fiction hardcover and paperback, Nonfiction, Picture Books hardcover and paperback

Late that year, the AAP Board voted to fund a new version of the Awards, which had been &quot;close to expiring from lack of support&quot;. At the time, AAP and Harper &amp; Row president Brooks Thomas anticipated &quot;probably fewer than ten&quot; categories, including some &quot;only for original paperbacks, not reprints&quot;. Edwin McDowell reported that &quot;many book-industry officials hope ... [to] rank in importance with the $15,000 Booker McConnell Prize for Fiction&quot; (British).

For 1983 publications (January to October) there would be no awards. A committee comprising American Book Awards executive director Barbara Prete and four publishers designed the new and improved program, implemented fall 1984 for a publication year beginning November 1983. They cut the roster to merely three (Nonfiction, Fiction, and First Work of Fiction), moved the ceremony from early spring to late fall, and redefined eligibility to require publication during the calendar year of the awards (roughly, see Annual eligibility). There were only fiction and nonfiction awards in 1986.

=== 1987-present day ===

In 1987 the &quot;National&quot; award returned in name. Covering the November ceremony, Edwin McDowell of &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarked upon the recurring changes in format and contrasted 1983 in particular, when there were 96 finalists in 27 awards categories (listed above).

The surviving awards for general Fiction and Nonfiction, now with precisely five finalists each, were administered by National Book Awards, Inc., whose Chairman of the Board was the president of Hearst Trade Book Group. He declaimed that &quot;Book people are really not actors, and there&#x27;s a realization now that we should not try to reward things like who did the best book blurb.&quot; The fixed number five finalists was retained through 2012, while the number of book categories has doubled with the addition of Poetry in 1991 and Young People&#x27;s Literature in 1996. Beginning with 2013, the Foundation announced there would be a &quot;longlist&quot; of 10 titles in each of the four categories in September (40 titles), followed by a &quot;finalist&quot; list of 5 titles in October (20 titles), and then the winners in November (4 titles). In 2018 a fifth award category was announced, the National Book Award for Translated Literature. It is for living translators and authors and for fiction and non-fiction. The foundation previously gave a translation award from 1967-1983, but did not require the author to be living and was for fiction only.

In 2024, the National Book Foundation announced the awards would no longer require U.S. citizenship for eligibility, following a similar decision the Pulitzer Prizes had made in 2023.

== Annual eligibility ==
A book must be published &quot;between December 1 of the previous year and November 30 of the current year&quot; to be eligible. Its publisher must complete a nomination in the spring and mail copies to the panelists. The panelists read all the valid nominees during this time, and the panels compile shortlists in September.

The pre-war awards were announced in the winter, usually February, and described with reference to the year of publication, if any; for example, &quot;National Book Awards for 1939&quot; announced February 1940. The 1950 to 1983 awards, as the National Book Foundation labeled them, were presented in the spring to works published during the preceding calendar year. Since 1984 the NBA have been presented in the fall, usually November, to books published roughly during the calendar year (December of the previous year through November).

== Medal for Distinguished Contribution (lifetime) ==
The Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters is a lifetime achievement award presented by the Foundation at the final ceremony for the Book Awards. The medal comes with a cash prize of $10,000. It recognizes someone who &quot;has enriched [American] literary heritage over a life of service, or a corpus of work.&quot;

<doc id="63098" wikidata="Q1071710" url="?curid=63098" title="Optic chiasm">
<text>In neuroanatomy, the optic chiasm, or optic chiasma (; , ), is the part of the brain where the optic nerves cross. It is located at the bottom of the brain immediately inferior to the hypothalamus. The optic chiasm is found in all vertebrates, although in cyclostomes (lampreys and hagfishes), it is located within the brain.

This article is about the optic chiasm of vertebrates, which is the best known nerve chiasm, but not every chiasm denotes a crossing of the body midline (e.g., in some invertebrates, see Chiasm (anatomy)). A midline crossing of nerves inside the brain is called a decussation (see Definition of types of crossings).

==Structure==


In all vertebrates, the optic nerves of the left and the right eye meet in the body midline, ventral to the brain. In many vertebrates the left optic nerve crosses over the right one without fusing with it.

In vertebrates with a large overlap of the visual fields of the two eyes, i.e., most mammals and birds, but also amphibians, reptiles such as chameleons, the two optic nerves merge in the optic chiasm. In such a merged optic chiasm, part of the nerve fibres do not cross the midline, but continue towards the optic tract of the ipsilateral side. By this partial decussation, the part of the visual field that is covered by both eyes is fused so that the processing of binocular depth perception by stereopsis is enabled (see Figure 2).

In the case of such partial decussation, the optic nerve fibres on the medial sides of each retina (which correspond to the lateral side of each visual hemifield, because the image is inverted) cross over to the opposite side of the body midline. The inferonasal retina are related to the anterior portion of the optic chiasm whereas superonasal retinal fibers are related to the posterior portion of the optic chiasm.

The partial crossing over of optic nerve fibres at the optic chiasm allows the visual cortex to receive the same hemispheric visual field from both eyes. Superimposing and processing these monocular visual signals allow the visual cortex to generate binocular and stereoscopic vision. The net result is that the right cerebral hemisphere processes left visual hemifield, and the left cerebral hemisphere processes the right visual hemifield.

Beyond the optic chiasm, with crossed and uncrossed fibers, the optic nerves are called optic tracts. The optic tract inserts on the optic tectum (in mammals known as superior colliculus) of the midbrain. In mammals they also branch off to the lateral geniculate body of the thalamus, in turn giving them to the occipital cortex of the cerebrum.

=== Arterial supply ===
The optic chiasma receives its arterial supply from the anterior cerebral arteries, and from branches of the internal carotid artery which ascend along the pituitary stalk (the latter supplying the midline portion of the chiasma).

==Development in mammals==

During development, the crossing of the optic nerves is guided primarily by cues such as netrin, slit, semaphorin and ephrin; and by morphogens such as sonic hedgehog (Shh) and Wnt. This navigation is mediated by the neuronal growth cone, a structure that responds to the cues by ligand-receptor signalling systems that activate downstream pathways inducing changes in the cytoskeleton. Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons leaving the eye through the optic nerve are blocked from exiting the developing pathway by Slit2 and Sema5A inhibition, expressed bordering the optic nerve pathway. Ssh expressed at the central nervous system midline inhibits crossing prior to the chiasm, where it is downregulated. The organization of RGC axons changes from retinotopic to a flat sheet-like orientation as they approach the chiasm site.

Most RGC axons cross the midline at the ventral diencephalon and continue to the contralateral superior colliculus. The number of axons that do not cross the midline and project ipsilaterally depends on the degree of binocular vision of the animal (3% in mice and 45% in humans do not cross). Ephrin-B2 is expressed at the chiasm midline by radial glia and acts as a repulsive signal to axons originating from the ventrotemporal retina expressing EphB1 receptor protein, giving rise to the ipsilateral, or uncrossed, projection. RGC axons that do cross at the optic chiasm are guided by the vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF-A, expressed at the midline, which signals through the receptor Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) expressed on RGC axons. Chiasm crossing is also promoted by Nr-CAM (Ng-CAM-related cell adhesion molecule) and Semaphorin6D (Sema6D) expressed at the midline, which form a complex that signals to Nr-CAM/Plexin-A1 receptors on crossing RGC axons.

==Other animals==

=== Mammals ===


Since all vertebrates, even the earliest fossils and modern jawless ones, possess an optic chiasm, it is not known how it evolved. A number of theories have been proposed for the function of the optic chiasm in vertebrates (see theories). According to the Axial Twist theory the optic chiasm develops as a consequence of a twist in the early embryo.

In Siamese cats with certain genotypes of the albino gene, the wiring is disrupted, with more of the nerve-crossing than normal. Since siamese cats, like albino tigers, also tend to cross their eyes (strabismus), it has been proposed that this behavior might compensate the abnormal amount of decussation.

=== Cephalopods and insects ===

In cephalopods and insects the optic tracts do not cross the body midline, so each side of the brain processes the ipsilateral eye.

== History ==
The crossing of nerve fibres, and the impact on vision that this had, was probably first identified by Persian physician &quot;Esmail Jorjani&quot;, who appears to be Zayn al-Din Gorgani (1042–1137).

<text>Ishmael is a 1992 philosophical novel by Daniel Quinn. The novel examines the hidden cultural biases driving modern civilization and explores themes of ethics, sustainability, and global catastrophe. Largely framed as a Socratic conversation between two characters, &quot;Ishmael&quot; aims to expose that several widely accepted assumptions of modern society, such as human supremacy, are actually cultural myths that produce catastrophic consequences for humankind and the environment. The novel was awarded the $500,000 Turner Tomorrow Fellowship Award in 1991, a year before its formal publication.

&quot;Ishmael&quot; is part of a loose trilogy that includes a 1996 spiritual sequel, &quot;The Story of B&quot;, and a 1997 &quot;sidequel,&quot; &quot;My Ishmael&quot;. Quinn also details how he arrived at the ideas behind &quot;Ishmael&quot; in his 1994 autobiography, &quot;&quot;. Yet another related book is Quinn&#x27;s 1999 short treatise, &quot;Beyond Civilization&quot;.

==Plot summary ==

Implicitly set in the early 1990s, &quot;Ishmael&quot; begins with a newspaper advertisement: &quot;Teacher seeks pupil. Must have an earnest desire to save the world. Apply in person&quot;. The nameless narrator and protagonist thus begins his story, telling how he first reacted to this ad with scorn because of the absurdity of &quot;wanting to save the world&quot;, a notion he feels that he once naïvely embraced himself as an adolescent during the counterculture movement of the 1960s. Feeling he must discover the ad&#x27;s publisher, he follows its address, surprisingly finding himself in a room with a live gorilla. On the wall is a sign with a double meaning: &quot;With man gone, will there be hope for gorilla?&quot; Suddenly, the gorilla, calling himself Ishmael, begins communicating to the man telepathically. At first baffled by this, the man learns the story of how the gorilla came to be here and soon accepts Ishmael as his teacher, regularly returning to Ishmael&#x27;s office. The novel continues from this point mainly as a dialogue between Ishmael and his new student.

Ishmael&#x27;s life began in the African wilderness, though he was captured at a young age and has lived mostly in a zoo and a menagerie (before living permanently in a private residence), which caused Ishmael to start thinking about ideas that he never would have thought about in the wild, including self-awareness, human language and culture, and what he refers to as the subject he specifically teaches: &quot;captivity&quot;. The narrator admits to Ishmael that he has a vague notion of living in some sort of cultural captivity and being lied to in some way by society, but he cannot articulate these feelings fully.

The man frequently visits Ishmael over the next several weeks, and Ishmael proceeds to use the Socratic method to deduce with the man what &quot;origin story&quot; and other &quot;myths&quot; modern civilization subscribes to. Before proceeding, Ishmael lays down some basic definitions for his student:

* A &quot;story&quot; is an interrelation between the gods, humans, and the earth—with a beginning, middle, and end.
* To &quot;enact&quot; is to behave in such a way to make a story (however true or not) come true.
* A &quot;culture&quot; is a people who are enacting a story.
* &quot;Takers&quot; are &quot;civilized&quot; people, particularly, members of the culture that first emerged in an Agricultural Revolution starting 10,000 years ago in the Near East that has developed into today&#x27;s globalized society (the culture of Ishmael&#x27;s pupil and, presumably, the reader).
* &quot;Leavers&quot; are people of all other non-civilized cultures existing in the past and the present; often derogatorily referred to by Takers as &quot;primitive&quot;.

At first, the narrator is certain that civilized people no longer believe in any &quot;myths&quot;, but Ishmael proceeds to gradually tease from him several hidden but widely accepted premises of &quot;mythical&quot; thinking being enacted by the Takers:
*Humans (especially Takers) are the pinnacle of evolution.
*The world was made for humans, and humans are thus destined to conquer and rule the world.
*This conquest is meant to bring about a paradise, as humans increase their mastery over controlling nature.
*However, humans are always failing in this conquest because they are flawed beings, who are unable to ever obtain the knowledge of how to live best.
*Therefore, however hard humans labor to save the world, they are just going to go on defiling and destroying it.
*Even so, civilization—the great human project of trying to control the whole world—must continue, or else humans will go extinct.

Ishmael points out to his student that when the Takers decided all of this, especially the idea that there is something fundamentally wrong with humans, they took as evidence only their own particular culture&#x27;s history: &quot;They were looking at a half of one percent of the evidence taken from a single culture. Not a reasonable sample on which to base such a sweeping conclusion&quot;. 
On the contrary, Ishmael asserts that there is nothing inherently wrong with humans and that a story that places humans in harmony with the world will cause humans to enact this harmony, while a destructive story such as this will cause humans to destroy the world, as humans are doing now. Ishmael goes on to help his student discover that, contrary to this Taker world-view, there is indeed knowledge of how humans should live: biological &quot;laws&quot; that life is subject to, discernible by studying the ecological patterns of other living things. Together, Ishmael and his student identify one set of survival strategies that appear to be true for all species (later dubbed the &quot;law of limited competition&quot;): in short, as a species, &quot;you may compete to the full extent of your capabilities, but you may not hunt down competitors or destroy their food or deny them access to food. In other words, you may compete but you may not wage war&quot;. All species inevitably follow this law, or as a consequence go extinct; the Takers, however, believe themselves to be exempt from this law and flout it at every point, which is therefore rapidly leading humanity towards extinction.

To illustrate his philosophy, Ishmael proposes a revision to the Christian myth of the Fall of Man. Ishmael&#x27;s version of why the fruit was forbidden to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden is: eating the fruit of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil provides gods with the knowledge of who shall live and who shall die—knowledge which they need to rule the world. The fruit nourishes only the gods, though. If Adam (&quot;humanity&quot;) were to eat from this tree, he might &quot;think&quot; that he gained the gods&#x27; wisdom (without this actually happening) and consequently destroy the world and himself through his arrogance. Ishmael makes the point that the myth of the Fall, which the Takers have adopted as their own, was in fact developed by Leavers to explain the origin of the Takers. If it were of Taker origin, the story would be of liberating progress instead of a sinful fall.

Ishmael and his student go on to discuss how, for the ancient herders among whom the tale originated, the Biblical story of Cain killing Abel symbolizes the Leaver being killed off and their lands taken so that it could be put under cultivation. These ancient herders realized that the Takers were acting as if they were gods themselves, with all the wisdom of what is good and evil and how to rule the world: agriculture is, in fact, an attempt to more greatly create and control life, a power that only gods can hold, not humans. To begin discerning the Leavers&#x27; story, Ishmael proposes to his student a hypothesis: the Takers&#x27; Agricultural Revolution was a revolution in trying to strenuously and destructively live &quot;above&quot; the laws of nature, against the Leavers&#x27; more ecologically peaceful story of living &quot;by&quot; the laws of nature.

The Takers, by practicing their uniquely envisioned form of agriculture (dubbed by Quinn &quot;totalitarian agriculture&quot; in a later book) produce enormous food surpluses, which consequently yields an ever-increasing population, which itself is leading to ecological imbalances and catastrophes around the world. Ishmael finishes his education with the student by saying that, in order for humanity to survive, Takers must relinquish their arrogant vision in favor of the Leaver humility in knowing that they do not possess any god-like knowledge of some &quot;one right way to live&quot;. They can adopt an alternative story that has humans as the first, not the final, fully-conscious creature. We can support evolution and diversity. Ishmael tells his student to teach a hundred people what he has learned, who can each pass this learning on to another hundred.

The student becomes busy at work, later discovering that Ishmael has fallen ill and died of pneumonia. Returning to Ishmael&#x27;s room one day, he collects Ishmael&#x27;s belongings. Among them he discovers that the sign he saw before (&quot;With man gone, will there be hope for gorilla?&quot;) has a backside with another message: &quot;With gorilla gone, will there be hope for man?&quot;

==Reinterpretation of biblical stories==
Ishmael proposes that the story of Genesis was written by the Semites and later adapted to work within Hebrew, Christian and Muslim belief structures. He proposes that Abel&#x27;s extinction metaphorically represents the nomadic Semites&#x27; losing in their conflict with agriculturalists. As they were driven further into the Arabian peninsula, the Semites became isolated from other herding cultures and, according to Ishmael, illustrated their plight through oral history, which was later adopted into the Hebrew book of Genesis.

Ishmael denies that the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil was forbidden to humans simply to test humans&#x27; self-control. Instead, he proposes that eating of the Tree would not actually give humans divine knowledge but would only make humans &quot;believe&quot; they had been given it, and that the Tree represents the choice to bear the responsibility of deciding which species live and which die. This is a decision agricultural peoples (i.e. Takers) make when deciding which organisms to cultivate, which to displace, and which to kill in protection of the first.

Ishmael explains that the Fall of Adam represents the belief that, once mankind usurps this responsibility—historically decided through natural ecology (i.e. food chains)—that humankind will perish. He cites as fulfillment of this prophecy contemporary environmental crises such as endangered or extinct species, global warming, and modern mental illnesses.

==Characters==

===Main characters===
* Ishmael is a gorilla, born in the 1930s, when he was captured from the West African wild and sent to an American zoo. After the zoo sold him to a menagerie, Walter Sokolow bought him and discovered that they could communicate telepathically. A few years after Sokolow died in 1985, Ishmael sets up an office and newspaper advertisements in search of pupils, with the help of Sokolow&#x27;s daughter, in order to begin teaching the subject of &quot;captivity&quot;. The narrator and Ishmael meet in 1991.
* The narrator and protagonist is a middle-aged white American man who sought a teacher to show him how to save the world when he was younger, during the turbulent and idealistic 1960s. Now an adult, he finds Ishmael&#x27;s ad looking for a pupil who wants to save the world. Intrigued because his childhood question may be answered, but skeptical because he has never found answers in the past, he goes and discovers this new teacher: Ishmael. The narrator never reveals his name in the novel, though it is revealed in the sequel &quot;My Ishmael&quot; to be Alan Lomax.

===Unseen characters===
*Walter Sokolow is a wealthy European Jewish merchant who is mentioned only in Ishmael&#x27;s back story but has died by the time of the main story. His family was killed in the Holocaust, during which Sokolow fled to the United States. While visiting a menagerie during World War Two, he came across a gorilla called Goliath (Ishmael&#x27;s given alias at the menagerie). After figuring out that he and Ishmael could mentally speak to each other, Sokolow renamed the gorilla &quot;Ishmael&quot; and bought him from the zoo. The two studied a vast array of subjects together and, after his death in 1985, Sokolow&#x27;s adult daughter Rachel funds Ishmael&#x27;s upkeep, though she herself dies from AIDS in 1991.

==References in popular culture==
The opening credits for the 1999 film &quot;Instinct&quot;, starring Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding Jr., indicate that it is inspired by &quot;Ishmael&quot;. Daniel Quinn did not approve of the script or movie before transferring the rights, which were transferred as part of the Turner Award, though he may have had some minor input on the script, though to a degree he personally considered trivial. The movie and book share no common story elements, and the philosophical connection to the book is reduced to some pictorial format and a few seconds of on-screen dialogue.

Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam has cited the book as an influence on their album, &quot;Yield&quot;. Quinn responds to the album&#x27;s significance in relation to the book on his website.

In Rise Against&#x27;s album &quot;The Sufferer and The Witness&quot;, &quot;Ishmael&quot; is on the album notes&#x27; recommended reading list.

The song &quot;The Taker Story&quot; on Chicano Batman&#x27;s 2017 album &quot;Freedom is Free&quot; describes the global colonization of the &quot;Taker&quot; societies based on the use of the term in &quot;Ishmael&quot;.

The name of prog metal band Animals as Leaders was inspired by the book.

<text>James Hilton (9 September 1900 – 20 December 1954) was a British-American novelist and screenwriter. He is best remembered for his novels &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;, &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; and &quot;Random Harvest&quot;, as well as co-writing screenplays for the films &quot;Camille&quot; (1936) and &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; (1942), the latter earning him an Academy Award.

== Early life and education ==
Hilton was born in Leigh, Lancashire, the son of John Hilton, the headmaster of Chapel End School in Walthamstow. He was educated at the Monoux School Walthamstow until 1914, then The Leys School, Cambridge, and then at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he wrote his first novel and was awarded an honours degree in English literature. He started work as a journalist, first for the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot;, then reviewing fiction for &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

== Career ==
Hilton&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Catherine Herself,&quot; was published in 1920 when he was still an undergraduate. The next 11 years were difficult for him, and it was not until 1931 that he had success with the novel &quot;And Now Goodbye&quot;. Following this, several of his books were international bestsellers and inspired successful film adaptations, notably &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; (1933), which won a Hawthornden Prize; &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; (1934); and &quot;Random Harvest&quot; (1941). After this, he continued to write, but the works were not regarded as of the same quality as his better-known novels.

Hilton&#x27;s books are sometimes characterised as sentimental and idealistic celebrations of English virtues. This is true of &quot;Mr. Chips&quot;, but some of his novels had a darker side. Flaws in the English society of his time—particularly narrow-mindedness and class-consciousness—were frequently his targets. His novel &quot;We Are Not Alone&quot;, despite its inspirational-sounding title, is a grim story of legally approved lynching brought on by wartime hysteria in Britain.

Sigmund Freud, an early admirer despite his tepid reaction to &quot;The Meadows of the Moon&quot;, came to conclude that Hilton had wasted his talent by being too prolific.

From 1948 to 1952, Hilton was also host of one of radio&#x27;s prestige drama anthologies, &quot;Hallmark Playhouse&quot;. He also presented six episodes of &quot;Ceiling Unlimited&quot; (1943) and hosted &quot;The Hallmark Playhouse&quot; (1948–1953) for CBS Radio.

===&quot;Lost Horizon&quot;===
First published in 1933, this novel won Hilton the Hawthornden Prize in 1934. Later, Pocket Books, which pioneered the publication of small, soft-cover, inexpensive books, picked &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; as its first title in 1939. For that reason, the novel is frequently called the book that began the &quot;paperback revolution.&quot;

Hilton is said to have been inspired to write &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;, and to invent &quot;Shangri-La&quot;, by reading the &quot;National Geographic&quot; articles of Joseph Rock, an Austrian-American botanist and ethnologist exploring the southwestern Chinese provinces and Tibetan borderlands. Still living in Britain at the time, Hilton was perhaps influenced by the Tibetan travel articles of early travelers in Tibet whose writings were found in the British Library. Christian Zeeman, the Danish father of the mathematician Christopher Zeeman, has also been claimed to be the model for the hero of the story. He disappeared while living in Japan (where his son was born in 1925), and was reputed to be living incognito in a Zen Buddhist monastery.

Some say that the isolated valley town of Weaverville, California, in far-northern Trinity County, was a source, but this is the result of a misinterpretation of a comment by Hilton in a 1941 interview, in which he said that Weaverville reminded him of Shangri-La. Coincidentally, Junction City (about 8 miles from Weaverville) now has a Tibetan Buddhist centre with the occasional Tibetan monks in saffron robes.

The name &quot;Shangri-La&quot; has become a byword for a mythical utopia, a permanently happy land, isolated from the world. After the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo, when the fact that the bombers had flown from an aircraft carrier remained highly classified, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt told the press facetiously that they had taken off from Shangri-La. The Navy subsequently gave that name to an aircraft carrier, and Roosevelt named his presidential retreat in Maryland Shangri-La. (Later, President Dwight D. Eisenhower renamed the retreat Camp David after his grandson, and that name has been used for it ever since.) Zhongdian, a mountain region in the northwest of Yunnan province China, has been renamed Shangri-La (Xianggelila), based on its claim to have inspired Hilton&#x27;s book.

===&quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot;===
W.H. Balgarnie, a master at The Leys School, Cambridge and Hilton&#x27;s father, headmaster of Chapel End School in Walthamstow, were the inspirations for the character of Mr. Chipping in &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot;, a best-seller. Hilton first sent the material to &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, and the magazine printed it as a short story in April 1934. On 8 June, it was published as a book. Four months later it appeared as a book in Britain.

== Personal life ==
Hilton wrote his two best remembered books, &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; and &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot;, while living in a house at 42 Oak Hill Gardens, in Woodford Green in northeast London. The house still stands, with a blue plaque marking Hilton&#x27;s residence. By 1938, he had moved to California, and his work became more connected with the Hollywood film industry.

He married Alice Brown, a secretary at the BBC, just before they left for the United States in 1935, but they divorced in 1937. The same year, he married actress Galina Kopernak, but they divorced eight years later. He became an American citizen in 1948.

== Death ==
A heavy smoker, Hilton had various health problems when he made a farewell visit to England in 1954, and in December he died at his home in Long Beach, California, from liver cancer, with his reconciled former wife Alice at his side. His obituary in &quot;The Times&quot; describes him as &quot;a modest and retiring man for all his success; he was a keen mountaineer and enjoyed music and travel.&quot; He was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Long Beach). After his wife Alice Brown Hilton died in 1962, his remains were reinterred at Knollkreg Memorial Park (Abingdon, Virginia).

==Adaptations and sequels of his works==

*&quot;Lost Horizon&quot; (1937, 1973)
*&quot;Knight Without Armour&quot; (1937)
*&quot;We Are Not Alone&quot; (1939) with a screenplay by Hilton

*&quot;Rage in Heaven&quot; (1941)

*&quot;The Story of Dr. Wassell&quot; (1944), starring Gary Cooper
*&quot;So Well Remembered&quot; (1947) starring John Mills and narrated by Hilton

Hilton co-wrote the book and lyrics for &quot;Shangri-La&quot;, a disastrous 1956 Broadway musical adaptation of &quot;Lost Horizon&quot;.

There is one sequel to &quot;Lost Horizon&quot; titled &quot;Shangri-La&quot; and written by Eleanor Cooney and Daniel Altieri. It was licensed by the publisher William Morrow (an imprint of HarperCollins) and approved by the heirs to the Hilton Estate, Elizabeth Hill and Mary Porterfield. &quot;Shangri-La&quot; continues James Hilton&#x27;s tale, moving it forward in time to the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and from there travelling back to the 1930s. In addition to its U.S. publication, the novel was further published in Germany, France, Spain and Portugal and Poland and (Eastern Europe) was a &quot;New York Times&quot; Notable Book.

==Memorials==
A furore was caused in the late 1990s, when Wigan Council (the Metropolitan Borough responsible for Leigh) announced that a blue plaque in honour of Hilton would be placed not on his house in Wilkinson Street, but on the town hall. This caused great debate amongst the populace of Leigh, which considered it more appropriate to have it on the house itself, which is only a few hundred yards from the town hall. Subsequently, in 2013, a blue plaque was affixed to his birthplace at 26 Wilkinson Street.

In 1997, a blue plaque was erected on the wall of 42 Oakhill Gardens, Woodford Green, the modest semi-detached house in which Hilton was living with his parents from 1921.

James Hilton should not be confused with the Leigh businessman of the same name who became chairman of Leigh Rugby League Football Club after the war and after whom the club&#x27;s former ground, Hilton Park (1947–2009), was named.

<text>Wholesaling or distributing is the sale of goods or merchandise to retailers; to industrial, commercial, institutional or other professional business users; or to other wholesalers (wholesale businesses) and related subordinated services. In general, it is the sale of goods in bulk to anyone, either a person or an organization, other than the end consumer of that merchandise. Wholesaling is buying goods in bulk quantity, usually directly from the manufacturer or source, at a discounted rate. The retailer then sells the goods to the end consumer at a higher price making a profit.

According to the United Nations Statistics Division, &quot;wholesale&quot; is the resale of new and used goods to retailers, to industrial, commercial, institutional or professional users, or to other wholesalers, or involves acting as an agent or broker in buying merchandise for, or selling merchandise to, such persons or companies. Wholesalers frequently physically assemble, sort, and grade goods in large lots, break-bulk, repack, and redistribute in smaller lots. While wholesalers of most products usually operate from independent premises, wholesale marketing for foodstuffs can take place at specific wholesale markets where all traders are congregated.

Traditionally, wholesalers were closer to the markets they supplied than the source from which they got the products. However, with the advent of the internet and e-procurement there is an increasing number of wholesalers located nearer to the manufacturers in China, Taiwan, and Southeast Asia. The profit margins of wholesalers depend largely on their ability to achieve market competitive transaction costs.

In the banking industry &quot;wholesale&quot; usually refers to wholesale banking, providing tailored services to large customers, in contrast with retail banking, providing standardized services to large numbers of smaller customers.

In real estate, wholesaling is the act of contracting to purchase real property, and assigning that contract to an investor.

==Taxes==
Often, in the United States, wholesalers are not required to charge their buyers sales tax, if the buyer has a resale license in the state the wholesaler is located. Out-of-state buyers are not charged sale tax by wholesalers.

In China, wholesalers are subject to a Value-Added Tax (VAT) of either 9% or 13% on imported goods, depending on the type of product. Additionally, consumption tax is levied on products such as tobacco, alcohol, and luxury goods. These taxes are part of China&#x27;s broader strategy to promote domestic consumption and regulate imports. On the other hand, Vietnam imposes a standard VAT rate of 10% on most goods and services, with exemptions for certain agricultural products and essential services. In Europe, Value-Added Tax (VAT) rates vary among member states, with a standard rate that cannot be less than 15%. Countries like Hungary, Croatia, Denmark, and Sweden have higher standard VAT rates, while Luxembourg, Malta, Cyprus, Germany, and Romania have lower rates. 

==Direct selling==

The alternative to selling wholesale to distributors or retailers is to sell retail either through company-owned stores or online. Advantages include receiving a larger slice of the price paid by the consumer; disadvantages include difficulty in reaching consumers. Direct selling is a business model wherein sellers sell the goods directly to the end customer.

<doc id="63105" wikidata="Q104146" url="?curid=63105" title="Deborah Kerr">
<text>Deborah Jane Trimmer CBE (30 September 192116 October 2007), known professionally as Deborah Kerr (), was a British actress. She was nominated six times for the Academy Award for Best Actress, becoming the first person from Scotland to be nominated for any acting Oscar.

During her international film career, Kerr won a Golden Globe Award for her performance as Anna Leonowens in the musical film &quot;The King and I&quot; (1956). Her other major and best known films and performances are &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot; (1943), &quot;Black Narcissus&quot; (1947), &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; (1951), &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1953), &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot; (1956), &quot;An Affair to Remember&quot; (1957), &quot;Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison&quot; (1957), &quot;Bonjour Tristesse&quot; (1958), &quot;Separate Tables&quot; (1958), &quot;The Sundowners&quot; (1960), &quot;The Grass Is Greener&quot; (1960), &quot;The Innocents&quot; (1961), and &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; (1964).

In 1994, having already received honorary awards from the Cannes Film Festival and BAFTA, Kerr received an Academy Honorary Award with a citation recognizing her as &quot;an artist of impeccable grace and beauty, a dedicated actress whose motion picture career has always stood for perfection, discipline and elegance&quot;.

== Early life ==
Deborah Jane Trimmer was born on 30 September 1921 in Hillhead, Glasgow, the only daughter of Kathleen Rose (née Smale) and Capt. Arthur Charles Kerr Trimmer, a World War I veteran and pilot who lost a leg at the Battle of the Somme and later became a naval architect and civil engineer. Trimmer and Smale married, both aged 28, on 21 August 1919 in Smale&#x27;s hometown of Lydney, Gloucestershire.

Young Deborah spent the first three years of her life in the Scottish west coast town of Helensburgh, where her parents lived with Deborah&#x27;s grandparents in a house on West King Street. Kerr had a younger brother, Edmund Charles (born 31 May 1926), who became a journalist. He died, aged 78, in a road rage incident in 2004.

Kerr was educated at the independent Northumberland House School, Henleaze in Bristol, England, and at Rossholme School, Weston-super-Mare. Kerr originally trained as a ballet dancer, first appearing on stage at Sadler&#x27;s Wells in 1938. After changing careers, she soon found success as an actress. Her first acting teacher was her aunt, Phyllis Smale, who worked at a drama school in Bristol run by Lally Cuthbert Hicks. She adopted the name Deborah Kerr on becoming a film actress (&quot;Kerr&quot; was a family name going back to the maternal grandmother of her grandfather Arthur Kerr Trimmer).

== Early career ==
===Early theatre and film===
Kerr&#x27;s first stage appearance was at Weston-super-Mare in 1937, as &quot;Harlequin&quot; in the mime play &quot;Harlequin and Columbine&quot;. She then went to the Sadler&#x27;s Wells ballet school and in 1938 made her début in the corps de ballet in &quot;Prometheus&quot;. After various walk-on parts in Shakespeare productions at the Open Air Theatre in Regent&#x27;s Park, London, she joined the Oxford Playhouse repertory company in 1940, playing, &quot;inter alia&quot;, &quot;Margaret&quot; in &quot;Dear Brutus&quot; and &quot;Patty Moss&quot; in &quot;The Two Bouquets&quot;.

Kerr&#x27;s first film role was in the British production &quot;Contraband&quot; (US: &quot;Blackout&quot;, 1940), aged 18 or 19, but her scenes were cut. She had a strong support role in &quot;Major Barbara&quot; (1941) directed by Gabriel Pascal.

===Film stardom===

Kerr became known playing the lead role in the film of &quot;Love on the Dole&quot; (1941). Critic James Agate wrote that &quot;Love on the Dole&quot; &quot;is not within a mile of Wendy Hiller&#x27;s in the theatre, but it is a charming piece of work by a very pretty and promising beginner, so pretty and so promising that there is the usual yapping about a new star&quot;.

She was the female lead in &quot;Penn of Pennsylvania&quot; (1941) which was little seen; however &quot;Hatter&#x27;s Castle&quot; (1942), in which she starred with Robert Newton and James Mason, was very successful. She played a Norwegian resistance fighter in &quot;The Day Will Dawn&quot; (1942). She was an immediate hit with the public: an American film trade paper reported in 1942 that she was the most popular British actress with Americans.

Kerr played three women in Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp&quot; (1943). During the filming, according to Powell&#x27;s autobiography, Powell and she became lovers: &quot;I realised that Deborah was both the ideal and the flesh-and-blood woman whom I had been searching for&quot;. Kerr made clear that her surname should be pronounced the same as &quot;car&quot;. To avoid confusion over pronunciation, Louis B. Mayer, head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer billed her as &quot;Kerr rhymes with Star!&quot; Although the British Army refused to co-operate with the producers—and Winston Churchill thought the film would ruin wartime morale—&quot;Colonel Blimp&quot; confounded critics when it proved to be an artistic and commercial success.

Powell hoped to reunite Kerr and lead actor Roger Livesey in his next film, &quot;A Canterbury Tale&quot; (1944), but her agent had sold her contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. According to Powell, his affair with Kerr ended when she made it clear to him that she would accept an offer to go to Hollywood if one were made.

In 1943, aged 21, Kerr made her West End début as Ellie Dunn in a revival of &quot;Heartbreak House&quot; at the Cambridge Theatre, stealing attention from stalwarts such as Edith Evans and Isabel Jeans. &quot;She has the rare gift&quot;, wrote critic Beverley Baxter, &quot;of thinking her lines, not merely remembering them. The process of development from a romantic, silly girl to a hard, disillusioned woman in three hours was moving and convincing&quot;.

Near the end of the Second World War, she also toured Holland, France, and Belgium for ENSA as Mrs Manningham in &quot;Gaslight&quot; (retitled &quot;Angel Street&quot;), and Britain (with Stewart Granger).

Alexander Korda cast her opposite Robert Donat in &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; (1945). The film was a big hit in Britain. So too was the spy comedy drama &quot;I See a Dark Stranger&quot; (1946), in which she gave a breezy, amusing performance that dominated the action and overshadowed her co-star Trevor Howard. This film was a production of the team of Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat.

Her role as a troubled nun in the Powell and Pressburger production of &quot;Black Narcissus&quot; (1947) brought her to the attention of Hollywood producers. The film was a hit in the US, as well as the UK, and Kerr won the New York Film Critics Award as Actress of the Year. British exhibitors voted her the eighth-most popular local star at the box-office in 1947. She relocated to Hollywood and was under contract to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer.

==Hollywood==
===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===

Kerr&#x27;s first film for MGM in Hollywood was a mature satire of the burgeoning advertising industry, &quot;The Hucksters&quot; (1947) with Clark Gable and Ava Gardner. She and Walter Pidgeon were cast in &quot;If Winter Comes&quot; (1947). She received the first of her Oscar nominations for &quot;Edward, My Son&quot; (1949), a drama set and filmed in England co-starring Spencer Tracy.

In Hollywood, Kerr&#x27;s British accent and manner led to a succession of roles portraying refined, reserved, and &quot;proper&quot; English ladies. Kerr, nevertheless, used any opportunity to discard her cool exterior. She had the lead in a comedy &quot;Please Believe Me&quot; (1950).

Kerr appeared in two huge hits for MGM in a row. &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; (1950) was shot on location in Africa with Stewart Granger and Richard Carlson. This was immediately followed by her appearance in the religious epic &quot;Quo Vadis&quot; (1951), shot at Cinecittà in Rome, in which she played the indomitable Lygia, a first-century Christian.

She then played Princess Flavia in a remake of &quot;The Prisoner of Zenda&quot; (1952) with Granger and Mason. In between Paramount borrowed her to appear in &quot;Thunder in the East&quot; (1951) with Alan Ladd.
In 1953, Kerr &quot;showed her theatrical mettle&quot; as Portia in Joseph Mankiewicz&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;. She made &quot;Young Bess&quot; (1953) with Granger and Jean Simmons, then appeared alongside Cary Grant in &quot;Dream Wife&quot; (1953), a flop comedy.

===&quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; and Broadway===

Kerr departed from typecasting with a performance that brought out her sensuality, as Karen Holmes, the embittered American military wife in Fred Zinnemann&#x27;s &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1953), for which she received an Oscar nomination for Best Actress. The American Film Institute acknowledged the iconic status of the scene from that film in which she and Burt Lancaster romped illicitly and passionately amidst crashing waves on a Hawaiian beach. The organisation ranked it 20th in its list of the 100 most romantic films of all time.

Having established herself as a film actress in the meantime, she made her Broadway debut in 1953, appearing in Robert Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot;, for which she received a Tony Award nomination. Kerr performed the same role in Vincente Minnelli&#x27;s film adaptation released in 1956; her stage partner John Kerr (no relation) also appeared. In 1955, Kerr won the Sarah Siddons Award for her performance in Chicago during a national tour of the play. After her Broadway début in 1953, she toured the United States with &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot;.

===Peak years of stardom===

Thereafter, Kerr&#x27;s career choices would make her known in Hollywood for her versatility as an actress. She played the repressed wife in &quot;The End of the Affair&quot; (1955), shot in England with Van Johnson. She was a widow in love with William Holden in &quot;The Proud and Profane&quot; (1956), directed by George Seaton. Neither film was much of a hit. However Kerr then played Anna Leonowens in the film version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical &quot;The King and I&quot; (1956); with Yul Brynner in the lead; it was a huge hit. Marni Nixon dubbed Kerr&#x27;s singing voice.

She played a nun in &quot;Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison&quot; (1957) opposite her long-time friend Robert Mitchum, directed by John Huston. It was very popular as was &quot;An Affair to Remember&quot; (1957) opposite Cary Grant.

Kerr starred in three films with David Niven: &quot;Bonjour Tristesse&quot; (1958), directed by Otto Preminger, &quot;Separate Tables&quot; (1958), directed by Delbert Mann, which was particularly well received, and &quot;Eye of the Devil&quot; (1966), directed by J. Lee Thompson.

She made two films at MGM: &quot;The Journey&quot; (1959) reunited her with Brynner; &quot;Count Your Blessings&quot; (1959), was a comedy. Both flopped, as did &quot;Beloved Infidel&quot; (1959) with Gregory Peck.

==Later films==

Kerr was reunited with Mitchum in &quot;The Sundowners&quot; (1960) shot in Australia, then &quot;The Grass Is Greener&quot; (1960), co-starring Cary Grant. She appeared in Gary Cooper&#x27;s last film &quot;The Naked Edge&quot; (1961) and starred in &quot;The Innocents&quot; (1961) where she plays a governess tormented by apparitions.

Kerr made her British TV debut in &quot;Three Roads to Rome&quot; (1963). She was another governess in &quot;The Chalk Garden&quot; (1964) and worked with John Huston again in &quot;The Night of the Iguana&quot; (1964).

She joined Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra in a love triangle for a romantic comedy, &quot;Marriage on the Rocks&quot; (1965).

In 1965, the producers of &quot;Carry On Screaming!&quot; offered her a fee comparable to that paid to the rest of the cast combined, but she turned it down in favour of appearing in an aborted stage version of &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot;. She replaced Kim Novak in &quot;Eye of the Devil&quot; (1966) with Niven, and was reteamed with Niven in the comedy &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967), achieving the distinction of being, at 45, the oldest &quot;Bond girl&quot; in any James Bond film, until Monica Bellucci, at the age of 50, in &quot;Spectre&quot; (2015). &quot;Casino Royale&quot; was a hit as was another movie she made with Niven, &quot;Prudence and the Pill&quot; (1968). She made &quot;The Arrangement&quot; (1969) with Elia Kazan, her director from the stage production of &quot;Tea and Sympathy&quot;. She returned to the cinema one more time in 1985&#x27;s &quot;The Assam Garden&quot;.

==Theatre==

Concern about parts offered her made her abandon film at the end of the 1960s, with one exception in 1985, in favour of television and theatre work.

Kerr returned to the London stage in many productions, including the old-fashioned, &quot;The Day After the Fair&quot; (Lyric, 1972), a Peter Ustinov comedy, &quot;Overheard&quot; (Haymarket, 1981) and a revival of Emlyn Williams&#x27;s &quot;The Corn is Green&quot;. After her first London success in 1943, she toured England and Scotland in &quot;Heartbreak House&quot;.

In 1975, she returned to Broadway, creating the role of Nancy in Edward Albee&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning play &quot;Seascape&quot;.

In 1977, she came back to the West End, playing the title role in a production of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Candida&quot;.

The theatre, despite her success in films, was always to remain Kerr&#x27;s first love, even though going on stage filled her with trepidation:
==Television==
Kerr experienced a career resurgence on television in the early 1980s when she played the role of the nurse (played by Elsa Lanchester in the 1957 film of the same name) in &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot;, with Sir Ralph Richardson. She also did &quot;A Song at Twilight&quot; (1982).

She took on the role of the older Emma Harte, a tycoon, in the adaptation of Barbara Taylor Bradford&#x27;s &quot;A Woman of Substance&quot; (1985). For this performance, Kerr was nominated for an Emmy Award.

Kerr rejoined old screen partner Mitchum in &quot;Reunion at Fairborough&quot; (1985). Other TV roles included &quot;Ann and Debbie&quot; (1986) and &quot;Hold the Dream&quot; (1986), the latter a sequel to &quot;A Woman of Substance&quot;.

== Personal life ==

Kerr&#x27;s first marriage was to Squadron Leader Anthony Bartley RAF on 29 November 1945. They had two daughters, Melanie Jane (born 27 December 1947) and Francesca Ann (born 18 December 1951, who married the actor John Shrapnel). Through Francesca they had three grandsons, actors Lex Shrapnel and Tom Shrapnel as well as the writer Joe Shrapnel. Melanie is a medical sociologist and retired academic. The marriage was troubled, owing to Bartley&#x27;s envy of his wife&#x27;s fame and financial success, and because her career often took her away from home. They divorced in 1959.

Her second marriage was to author Peter Viertel on 23 July 1960. In marrying Viertel, she became stepmother to Viertel&#x27;s daughter, Christine Viertel. Although she long resided in Klosters, Switzerland, and Marbella, Spain, Kerr moved back to Britain to be closer to her own children as her health began to deteriorate. Her husband, however, continued to live in Marbella.

Stewart Granger said in his autobiography that in 1945 she had approached him romantically in the back of his chauffeur-driven car at the time he was making &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot;. Although he was married to Elspeth March, he states that he and Kerr went on to have an affair. When asked about this revelation, Kerr&#x27;s response was, &quot;What a gallant man he is!&quot;

== Death ==

Kerr died aged 86 on 16 October 2007 at Botesdale, a village in the county of Suffolk, England, from the effects of Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

Within three weeks of her death, her husband Peter Viertel died of cancer on 4 November. At the time of Viertel&#x27;s death, director Michael Scheingraber was filming the documentary &quot;Peter Viertel: Between the Lines&quot;, which includes reminiscences concerning Kerr and the Academy Awards.

== Honours ==
Kerr was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1998, but was unable to accept the honour in person because of ill health. She was also honoured in Hollywood, where she received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1709 Vine Street for her contributions to the motion picture industry.

Although nominated six times as Best Actress, Kerr never won a competitive Oscar. In 1994, Glenn Close presented Kerr with the Honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement with a citation recognising her as &quot;an artist of impeccable grace and beauty, a dedicated actress whose motion picture career has always stood for perfection, discipline and elegance&quot;.

Kerr won a Golden Globe Award for &quot;Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy&quot; for &quot;The King and I&quot; in 1957 and a Henrietta Award for &quot;World Film Favorite – Female&quot;. She was the first performer to win the New York Film Critics Circle Award for &quot;Best Actress&quot; three times (1947, 1957 and 1960).

Although she never won a BAFTA or Cannes Film Festival award in a competitive category, both organisations gave Kerr honorary awards: a Cannes Film Festival Tribute in 1984 and a BAFTA Special Award in 1991.

In September and October 2010, Josephine Botting of the British Film Institute curated the &quot;Deborah Kerr Season&quot;, which included around twenty of her feature films and an exhibition of posters, memorabilia and personal items loaned by her family.

In September 2021, Kerr&#x27;s grandsons, Joe and Lex Shrapnel, unveiled a memorial plaque at the former family home in Weston-super-Mare.

On 30 September 2021, on what would have been Kerr&#x27;s one hundredth birthday, the Lord Provost of Glasgow, Philip Braat, unveiled a memorial plaque in Ruskin Terrace, on the site of the nursing home where Kerr was born.

<text>Modal jazz is jazz that makes use of musical modes, often modulating among them to accompany the chords instead of relying on one tonal center used across the piece.

Though exerting influence to the present, modal jazz was most popular in the 1950s and 1960s, as evidenced by the success of Miles Davis&#x27;s 1958 composition &quot;Milestones&quot; and 1959 album &quot;Kind of Blue&quot;, and John Coltrane&#x27;s quartet from 1960 to 1965. Other performers of modal jazz include Chick Corea, Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, Joe Henderson, Bobby Hutcherson, Pharoah Sanders, Woody Shaw, Wayne Shorter, McCoy Tyner, and Larry Young.

==History==
In bebop as well as in hard bop, musicians use chords to provide the background for solos. A piece starts out with a theme that introduces a series of chords for the solos. These chords repeat throughout the whole piece, while the soloists play new, improvised themes over the repeated chord progression. By the 1950s, improvising over chords had become such a dominant part of jazz that sidemen at recording dates were sometimes given nothing more than a list of chords to play from.

Mercer Ellington has stated that Juan Tizol conceived the melody to &quot;Caravan&quot; in 1936 as a result of his days studying music in Puerto Rico, where they could not afford much sheet music so the teacher would turn the music upside down after they had learned to play it right-side up. This &quot;inversion&quot; technique led to a modal sound throughout Tizol&#x27;s work.

Sun Ra reportedly rehearsed a small group consisting of Harold Ousley, Vernel Fournier, and Wilbur Ware in 1950 that played original songs that were modal in which the melody was based on a single chord or vamp – ten years before this approach became popular in jazz. 

Saxophonist Wayne Shorter has noted that the 1953 composition &quot;Glass Enclosure&quot; by pianist Bud Powell was one of the earliest jazz compositions to make use of Lydian chords, based on the Lydian mode that was not widely used in jazz until about a decade later. Powell&#x27;s 1951 Un Poco Loco uses the Lydian chords and even uses Lydian chords stacked on top of each implying a polytonality (D major 7 over C major 7: CEGBDF#AC#) with the improvisation based on alternating Lydian-ish polytonality and an altered dominant chord.

Towards the end of the 1950s, spurred by the experiments of composer and bandleader George Russell, musicians began using a modal approach. They chose not to write their pieces using conventional chord changes, but instead using modes. Musicians employing this technique include Miles Davis, Freddie Hubbard, Bill Evans, Herbie Hancock, and Wayne Shorter.
Among the significant compositions of modal jazz were &quot;So What&quot; by Miles Davis and &quot;Impressions&quot; by John Coltrane. &quot;So What&quot; and &quot;Impressions&quot; follow the same AABA structure and were in D Dorian for the A sections and modulated a half step up to E-flat Dorian for the B section. The Dorian mode is the natural minor scale with a raised sixth. Other compositions include Davis&#x27;s &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot;, Bill Evans&#x27;s &quot;Peace Piece&quot;, and Shorter&#x27;s &quot;Footprints&quot;.

Davis recorded one of the best selling jazz albums of all time in this modal framework. &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; is an exploration of the possibilities of modal jazz. Davis acknowledged the crucial role played by Bill Evans, a former member of George Russell&#x27;s ensembles, in his transition from hard bop to modal playing. Although his explorations of modal jazz were sporadic throughout the 1960s, he included several of the tunes from &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; in the repertoire of his second quintet.

Coltrane took the lead in extensively exploring the limits of modal improvisation and composition with his quartet, featuring Elvin Jones (drums), McCoy Tyner (piano), and Reggie Workman and Jimmy Garrison (bass). Several of Coltrane&#x27;s albums from the period are recognized as examples of modal jazz: &quot;Africa/Brass&quot; (1961), &quot;Live! at the Village Vanguard&quot; (1962), &quot;Crescent&quot; (1964), &quot;A Love Supreme&quot; (1964), and &quot;Meditations&quot; (1965). Coltrane&#x27;s compositions from this period such as &quot;India&quot;, &quot;Chasin&#x27; the Trane&quot;, &quot;Crescent&quot;, and &quot;Impressions&quot; have entered the jazz repertoire, along with his interpretations of standards like Richard Rodgers&#x27;s &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;, and the traditional &quot;Greensleeves&quot;.

<text>Post-rock is a subgenre of experimental rock characterized by the exploration of textures and timbres as well as non-rock styles, often with minimal or no vocals, placing less emphasis on conventional song structures or riffs than on atmosphere for musically evocative purposes. Post-rock artists can often combine rock instrumentation and rock stylings with electronics and digital production as a means of enabling the exploration of textures, timbres and different styles. The genre emerged within the indie and underground music scenes of the 1980s and 1990s, but as it abandoned rock conventions, it began to show less musical resemblance to conventional indie rock at the time. The first wave of post-rock derives inspiration from diverse sources including ambient, electronica, jazz, krautrock, psychedelia, dub, and minimalist classical, with these influences also being pivotal for the substyle of ambient pop.

Groups such as Talk Talk and Slint were credited with producing foundational works in the style in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The term &quot;post-rock&quot; was notably employed by journalist Simon Reynolds in a review of Bark Psychosis&#x27; 1994 album &quot;Hex&quot;, published in the March 1994 issue of &quot;Mojo&quot; magazine. With the release of Tortoise&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;Millions Now Living Will Never Die&quot;, post-rock became an accepted term for the associated scene of artists. The term has since developed to refer to bands oriented around dramatic and suspense-driven instrumental rock, making the term controversial among listeners and artists alike.

==Etymology==
The concept of &quot;post-rock&quot; was initially developed by Reynolds in the May 1994 issue of &quot;The Wire&quot; to describe music &quot;using rock instrumentation for non-rock purposes, using guitars as facilitators of timbre and textures rather than riffs and power chords&quot;. He further expounded on the term that 

Reynolds, in a July 2005 entry in his blog, said that he had used the concept of &quot;post-rock&quot; before using it in &quot;Mojo&quot;, previously referring to it in a feature on Insides for music newspaper &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. He also said he later found the term not to be of his own coinage, writing in his blog &quot;I discovered many years later it had been floating around for over a decade.&quot; In 2021, Reynolds reflected on the evolution of the style, saying that the term had developed in meaning during the 21st century, no longer referring to &quot;left-field UK guitar groups engaged in a gradual process of abandoning songs [and exploring] texture, effects processing, and space,&quot; but instead coming to signify &quot;epic and dramatic instrumental rock, not nearly as post- as it likes to think it is.&quot;

Earlier uses of the term include its employment in a 1975 article by American journalist James Wolcott about musician Todd Rundgren, although with a different meaning. It was also used in the &quot;Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; to name a style roughly corresponding to &quot;avant-rock&quot; or &quot;out-rock&quot;. The earliest use of the term cited by Reynolds dates back as far as September 1967. In a &quot;Time&quot; cover story feature on the Beatles, writer Christopher Porterfield hails the band and producer George Martin&#x27;s creative use of the recording studio, declaring that this is &quot;leading an evolution in which the best of current post-rock sounds are becoming something that pop music has never been before an art form.&quot; Another pre-1994 example of the term in use can be found in an April 1992 review of 1990s noise-pop band The Earthmen by Steven Walker in Melbourne music publication &quot;Juke&quot;, where he describes a &quot;post-rock noisefest&quot;.

==Characteristics==

Post-rock incorporates stylings and traits from a variety of musical genres and scenes, including krautrock, ambient, psychedelia, prog rock, space rock, math rock, tape music and other experimental recording techniques, minimalist classical, British IDM, jazz (both avant-garde and cool), and dub, as well as post-punk, free jazz, contemporary classical, and avant-garde electronica. It can also bear similarities to drone music, and usage of drones in psychedelic rock. Early post-rock groups often exhibited strong influence from the krautrock of the 1970s, particularly borrowing elements of the &quot;motorik&quot;, the characteristic krautrock rhythm.

Post-rock compositions can often make use of repetition of musical motifs and subtle changes with an extremely wide range of dynamics. In some respects, this is similar to the music of Steve Reich, Philip Glass and Brian Eno, pioneers of minimalism who were acknowledged influences on bands in the first wave of post-rock. Post-rock pieces can be lengthy and instrumental, containing repetitive build-ups of timbres, dynamics and textures. Vocals are often omitted from post-rock; however, this does not necessarily mean they are absent entirely. When vocals are included, the use is typically non-traditional: some post-rock bands employ vocals as purely instrumental efforts and incidental to the sound, rather than a more traditional use where &quot;clean&quot;, easily interpretable vocals are important for poetic and lyrical meaning. When present, post-rock vocals are often soft or droning and are typically infrequent or present in irregular intervals, and have abstract or impersonal lyrics. Sigur Rós, a band known for their distinctive vocals, fabricated a language they called &quot;Hopelandic&quot; (&quot;Vonlenska&quot; in Icelandic), which they described as &quot;a form of gibberish vocals that fits to the music and acts as another instrument.&quot;

Often, in lieu of typical rock structures like the verse-chorus form, post-rock groups make greater use of soundscapes. Simon Reynolds states in his essay &quot;Post-Rock&quot; from &quot;Audio Culture&quot; that &quot;A band&#x27;s journey through rock to post-rock usually involves a trajectory from narrative lyrics to stream-of-consciousness to voice-as-texture to purely instrumental music&quot;. Reynolds&#x27; conclusion defines the sporadic progression from rock, with its field of sound and lyrics to post-rock, where samples are manipulated, stretched and looped.

==History==
===Forerunners===
The Velvet Underground and their &quot;dronology&quot; have been referred to as &quot;a term that loosely describes fifty percent of today&#x27;s post rock activity.&quot; Other precursors include Faust, Neu! and Can, who influenced Stereolab and Mogwai. 

This Heat, which formed in 1976, are regarded as having predated the genre, while also being credited as an influence on bands in the first wave of post-rock. Their music has been compared directly to Slint, Swans and Stereolab. 

&quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; noted that David Bowie&#x27;s 1977 album &quot;Low&quot; would have been considered post-rock if released twenty years later while Louder cited the English art punk band Wire as &quot;the genre&#x27;s godfathers,&quot; highlighting their 1979 studio album &quot;154&quot; as an early precursor that signposted the beginning of post-rock.

British post-punk band Public Image Ltd (PiL) were also pioneers, described by the &quot;NME&quot; as &quot;arguably the first post-rock group&quot;. Their second album &quot;Metal Box&quot; (1979) almost completely abandoned traditional rock and roll structures in favor of dense, repetitive dub and krautrock inspired soundscapes and John Lydon&#x27;s cryptic, stream-of-consciousness lyrics. The year before &quot;Metal Box&quot; was released, PiL bassist Jah Wobble declared that &quot;rock is obsolete&quot;.

===1990s: first wave===

The term post-rock was first used to describe the eclectic, electronica-tinged rock-adjacent indie music of English bands such as Stereolab, Laika, Disco Inferno, Moonshake, Seefeel, Bark Psychosis, Pram and Insides, many of which began in post-punk and shoegaze roots; these were largely deemed post-rock as such in Reynolds&#x27; music journalism. Bands from the early 1990s such as Slint (with &quot;Spiderland&quot;) or, earlier, Talk Talk (with &quot;Laughing Stock&quot;), were recognized as influential on post-rock by later music critics. Despite marked differences between the two bands, with Talk Talk emerging from art rock and new wave and Slint emerging from post-hardcore, they both have had a driving influence on the way post-rock progressed throughout the 1990s.

Groups such as Tortoise and Cul de Sac, as well as more ambient-oriented bands from the Kranky label like Labradford, Bowery Electric, and Stars of the Lid, are often cited as foundational to the American first wave of post-rock, especially in the Chicago scene. The second Tortoise album, &quot;Millions Now Living Will Never Die&quot;, made the band a post-rock icon, with bands such as Do Make Say Think beginning to record music inspired by the &quot;Tortoise-sound&quot;.

In the late 1990s, Chicago was the home of a variety of acts associated with post-rock. John McEntire of Tortoise and Jim O&#x27;Rourke of Gastr Del Sol were important for many of these groups, with them both also producing multiple albums by Stereolab in the 1990s and 2000s. One of the most eminent post-rock locales became Montreal, where Godspeed You! Black Emperor and related groups, including Silver Mt. Zion and Fly Pan Am, released music on Constellation Records; these groups are generally characterized by a melancholy and crescendo-driven style rooted in, among other genres, chamber music, &quot;musique concrète&quot; techniques and free jazz influences. In 2000, Radiohead released the studio album &quot;Kid A&quot;, marking a significant turning point in their musical style, with Reynolds describing it and the 2001 follow-up album &quot;Amnesiac&quot; as major examples of post-rock in the style that had been established by the first wave, also showing the style making a mainstream breakthrough.

===2000s–2010s: second and third waves===

In the early 2000s, the term became divisive with both music critics and musicians, with it being seen at the time as falling out of favor. It became increasingly controversial as more critics outwardly condemned its use. Some of the bands for whom the term was most frequently assigned, including Cul de Sac, Tortoise, and Mogwai, rejected the label. The wide range of styles covered by the term, they and others have claimed, robbed it of its individuality.

As part of the second wave of post-rock, the bands Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Sigur Rós, Mogwai, Explosions in the Sky, 65daysofstatic, This Will Destroy You, Do Make Say Think, and Mono became some of the more popular post-rock acts of the new millennium. Sigur Rós, with the release of &quot;Ágætis byrjun&quot; in 1999, became among the most well known post-rock bands of the 2000s due to the use of many of their tracks, particularly their 2005 single &quot;Hoppípolla&quot;, in TV soundtracks and film trailers. These bands&#x27; popularity was attributed to a move towards a more conventional rock oriented sound with simpler song structures and increasing utilization of pop hooks, also being regarded as a new atmospheric style of indie rock.

Following a 13-year hiatus, experimental rock band Swans, who had been regarded as influencing post-rock, began releasing a number of albums that were described as post-rock, most notably &quot;To Be Kind&quot; which was acclaimed by AllMusic at the end of 2014.

Wider experimentation and blending of other genres have taken hold in the post-rock scene. Cult of Luna, Isis, Russian Circles, Palms, Deftones, and Pelican fused metal with post-rock styles, with the resulting sound being termed post-metal. More recently, sludge metal has grown and evolved to include (and in some cases fuse completely with) some elements of post-rock. This second wave of sludge metal has been pioneered by bands such as Giant Squid and Battle of Mice. This new sound is often seen on the label of Neurot Recordings. Similarly, bands such as Altar of Plagues, Lantlôs and Agalloch blend between post-rock and black metal, incorporating elements of the former while primarily using the latter. In some cases, this sort of experimentation and blending has gone beyond the fusion of post-rock with a single genre, as in the case of post-metal, in favor of an even wider embrace of disparate musical influences as it can be heard in bands like Deafheaven.

<text>David Copperfield is a novel by English author Charles Dickens, narrated by the eponymous David Copperfield, detailing his adventures in his journey from infancy to maturity. As such, it is typically categorized in the bildungsroman genre. It was published as a serial in 1849 and 1850 and then as a book in 1850.

&quot;David Copperfield&quot; is also a partially autobiographical novel: &quot;a very complicated weaving of truth and invention&quot;, with events following Dickens&#x27;s own life. Of the books he wrote, it was his favourite. Called &quot;the triumph of the art of Dickens&quot;, it marks a turning point in his work, separating the novels of youth and those of maturity.

At first glance, the work is modelled on 18th-century &quot;personal histories&quot; that were very popular, like Henry Fielding&#x27;s &quot;Joseph Andrews&quot; or &quot;Tom Jones&quot;, but &quot;David Copperfield&quot; is a more carefully structured work. It begins, like other novels by Dickens, with a bleak picture of childhood in Victorian England, followed by young Copperfield&#x27;s slow social ascent, as he painfully provides for his aunt, while continuing his studies.

Dickens wrote without an outline, unlike his previous novel, &quot;Dombey and Son&quot;. Some aspects of the story were fixed in his mind from the start, but others were undecided until the serial publications were underway. The novel has a primary theme of growth and change, but Dickens also satirises many aspects of Victorian life. These include the plight of prostitutes, the status of women in marriage, class structure, the criminal justice system, the quality of schools, and the employment of children in factories.

==Plot summary==

The story follows the life of David Copperfield from childhood to maturity. David was born in Blunderstone, Suffolk, England, six months after the death of his father. David spends his early years residing in a small house called the Rookery. His loving and childish mother and their kindly housekeeper, Clara Peggotty, bring him up him here, where they call him Davy. When he is seven years old, his mother marries Edward Murdstone without having told him they plan to marry. To get him out of the way, David is sent to visit Peggotty&#x27;s family in Yarmouth. Her brother, fisherman Mr Peggotty, lives in a beached barge, with his adopted niece and nephew Emily and Ham, and an elderly widow, Mrs Gummidge. &quot;Little Em&#x27;ly&quot; is somewhat spoiled by her fond foster father, and David is in love with her. They call him Master Copperfield.

On his return, David discovers his mother has married and is immediately given good reason to dislike his stepfather, Murdstone, who believes exclusively in stern, harsh methods of parenting, calling it &quot;firmness&quot;. David has similar feelings for Murdstone&#x27;s sister Jane, who moves into the house soon afterwards. Between them, they tyrannise David and his poor mother, making their lives miserable. When David falls behind in his studies, Murdstone thrashes him, and David bites his hand; in consequence, he is sent away to Salem House, a boarding school, under a ruthless headmaster named Mr Creakle. There he is befriended by an older boy, James Steerforth, and Tommy Traddles. He develops an impassioned admiration for Steerforth, perceiving him as someone noble, who could do great things if he would, and one who pays attention to him.

David goes home for the holidays to learn that his mother has given birth to a baby boy. Shortly after David returns to Salem House, his mother and her baby die, and David returns home immediately. Peggotty marries the local carrier, Mr Barkis. Murdstone sends David to work for a wine merchant in London – a business of which Murdstone is a joint owner. After some months, David&#x27;s friendly but spendthrift landlord, Wilkins Micawber, is arrested for debt and sent to the King&#x27;s Bench Prison, and the rest of Mr. Micawber&#x27;s family soon moves to the Prison too. David visits the Micawbers regularly at the Prison, and boards nearby. When Micawber&#x27;s release is imminent, the Micawbers decide they will soon move to Plymouth. David realises that will leave him alone in London, where no one cares about him. He makes up his mind to run away to Dover to find his only known remaining relative, his eccentric and kind-hearted great-aunt Betsey Trotwood. She had come to Blunderstone at his birth, only to depart in ire upon learning that he was not a girl. However, she takes it upon herself to raise David, despite Murdstone&#x27;s attempt to regain custody of him. She encourages him to &#x27;be as like his sister, &#x27;Betsey Trotwood&#x27; as he can be – that is, to meet the expectations she had for the girl who was never born. David&#x27;s great-aunt renames him &quot;Trotwood Copperfield&quot; and addresses him as &quot;Trot&quot;, one of several names others call David in the novel.

David&#x27;s aunt sends him to a better school than the last he attended. It is run by kind Dr. Strong, whose methods inculcate honour and self-reliance in his pupils. During term, David lodges with the lawyer Mr Wickfield and his daughter Agnes, who becomes David&#x27;s friend and confidante. Wickfield&#x27;s clerk, Uriah Heep, also lives at the house.

By devious means, Uriah Heep gradually gains a complete ascendancy over the aging and alcoholic Wickfield, to Agnes&#x27;s great sorrow. Heep, as he maliciously confides to David, aspires to marry Agnes. Ultimately with the aid of Micawber, who has been employed by Heep as a secretary, his fraudulent behaviour is revealed. (At the end of the book, David encounters him in prison, convicted of attempting to defraud the Bank of England.)

After completing school, David apprentices to be a proctor. During this time, due to Heep&#x27;s fraudulent activities, his aunt&#x27;s fortune has diminished. David toils to make a living. He works mornings and evenings for his former teacher Dr Strong as a secretary, and also starts to learn shorthand, with the help of his old school-friend Traddles, upon completion reporting parliamentary debate for a newspaper. With considerable moral support from Agnes and his own great diligence and hard work, David ultimately finds fame and fortune as an author, writing fiction.

David&#x27;s romantic but self-serving school friend, Steerforth, also re-acquainted with David, goes on to seduce and dishonour Emily, offering to marry her off to his manservant Littimer before deserting her in Europe. Her uncle Mr Peggotty manages to find her with the help of Martha, who had grown up in their part of England and then settled in London. Ham, who had been engaged to marry Emily before the tragedy, dies in a fierce storm off the coast while rescuing shipwreck victims. Steerforth was aboard the ship and also dies. Mr Peggotty takes Emily to a new life in Australia, accompanied by Mrs Gummidge and the Micawbers, where all eventually find security and happiness.

Meanwhile, David has fallen in love with Dora Spenlow, and marries her. Their marriage proves troublesome for David in the sense of everyday practical affairs, but he never stops loving her. Dora dies early in their marriage after a miscarriage. After Dora&#x27;s death, Agnes encourages David to return to normal life and his profession of writing. While living in Switzerland to dispel his grief over so many losses, David realises that he loves Agnes. Upon returning to Britain, after a failed attempt to conceal his feelings, David finds that Agnes loves him too. They quickly marry, and in this marriage he finds true happiness. David and Agnes then have at least five children, including a daughter named after his great-aunt, Betsey Trotwood.

==Characters==

*David Copperfield – The narrator and protagonist of the novel. David&#x27;s father, David Sr, dies six months before he is born, and he is raised by his mother and nursemaid Peggotty until his mother remarries. David&#x27;s stepfather, Mr Murdstone, sends David away to a boarding school. While attending school, David learns his mother has died, on his ninth birthday. He is sent to work at a factory until he runs away to find his aunt. David Copperfield is characterised in the book as trusting, goal-oriented, but as yet immature. He marries Dora Spenlow and later Agnes Wickfield.
*Clara Copperfield – David&#x27;s affectionate and beautiful mother, described as being innocently childish. She is married to David Copperfield Sr until his death, and gives birth six months later to the central character of the novel. She loves and coddles young David with the help of Peggotty. Years later she remarries Mr Murdstone. She dies a couple of months after the birth of her second son, who dies a day or so later, while David is away at Salem House boarding school.
*Clara Peggotty – The faithful servant of the Copperfield family and a lifelong companion to David – she is called by her surname Peggotty within David&#x27;s family, as her given name is Clara, the same as David&#x27;s mother; she is also referred to at times as Barkis after her marriage to Mr Barkis. After her husband&#x27;s death, Peggotty helps to put in order David&#x27;s rooms in London and then returns to Yarmouth to keep house for her nephew, Ham Peggotty. Following Ham&#x27;s death, she keeps house for David&#x27;s great-aunt, Betsey Trotwood.
*Betsey Trotwood – David&#x27;s eccentric and temperamental yet kind-hearted great-aunt; she becomes his guardian after he runs away from the Murdstone and Grinby warehouse in Blackfriars, London. She is present on the night of David&#x27;s birth but leaves after hearing that Clara Copperfield&#x27;s child is a boy instead of a girl, and is not seen again until David flees to her house in Dover from London. She is portrayed as affectionate towards David, and defends him and his late mother when Mr Murdstone arrives to take custody of David: she confronts the man and rebukes him for his abuse of David and his mother, then threatens him and drives him off the premises. Universally believed to be a widow, she conceals the existence of her ne&#x27;er-do-well husband who occasionally bleeds her for money.
*Dr Edward Chillip – A shy doctor who assists at David&#x27;s birth and faces the wrath and anger of Betsey Trotwood after he informs her that Clara&#x27;s baby is a boy instead of the girl Betsey wanted. David meets this doctor each time he returns to the neighbourhood of his birth. Mr Chillip, met in London when David Copperfield returns from Switzerland, tells David of the fate of Murdstone&#x27;s second wife, which is much the same as the fate of David&#x27;s mother.
*Mr Barkis – An aloof carter who declares his intention to marry Peggotty after eating her handmade pastries. He says to David: &quot;Tell her, &#x27;Barkis is willin&#x27;!&#x27; Just so.&quot; Peggotty marries him after Clara Copperfield&#x27;s death. He is a miser, keeping an unexpected amount of wealth in a plain box labelled &quot;Old Clothes&quot;. He bequeaths two-thirds of his money to his wife from his savings of £3,000 (about £ in present-day value (2022)) when he dies after about ten years of marriage. He leaves annuities for Mr Daniel Peggotty, Little Emily, and David from the rest.
*Edward Murdstone – The main antagonist of the first half of the novel, he is Young David&#x27;s cruel stepfather who beats him for falling behind in his studies and emotionally torments Clara. David reacts by biting Mr Murdstone, and is sent to Salem House – a private school owned by Mr Murdstone&#x27;s friend Mr Creakle – in retribution. After his mother dies, he sends David to work at his factory in London. He appears at Betsey Trotwood&#x27;s Dover house after David runs away. Mr Murdstone appears to show signs of repentance when confronted by Copperfield&#x27;s aunt about his treatment of Clara and David, but when David works at Doctors&#x27; Commons years later, he meets Murdstone taking out a marriage licence for his next young and trusting wife.
*Jane Murdstone – Mr Murdstone&#x27;s equally cruel spinster sister, who moves into the Copperfield house shortly after Mr Murdstone marries Clara Copperfield, taking over the housekeeping. Much like her brother she is domineering, mean-spirited, and petty. She is the &quot;Confidential Friend&quot; of David&#x27;s first wife, Dora Spenlow, and is the one who found David&#x27;s letters to Dora, and creates the scene between David Copperfield and Dora&#x27;s father, Mr Spenlow. Later, she rejoins her brother and his second wife in a marriage much like the one with David&#x27;s mother.
*Daniel Peggotty – Peggotty&#x27;s brother; a humble but generous Yarmouth fisherman who takes his nephew Ham and niece Emily into his custody after each of them has been orphaned. He welcomes David as a child when holidaying in Yarmouth with Peggotty. When Emily is older and runs away with David&#x27;s friend Steerforth, he travels around the world in search of her. He eventually finds her as a prostitute in London, and after that, they emigrate to Australia.

*Emily (Little Em&#x27;ly) – The niece of Daniel Peggotty and his sister Clara Peggotty. She is a childhood friend of David Copperfield, who loved her in his childhood days. She abandons Ham, her cousin and fiancé, on the eve of their wedding, disappearing abroad with Steerforth for several years. Broken by Steerforth&#x27;s desertion, she does not go back home, but she does eventually go to London. With the help of Martha, her uncle recovers her from the brink of prostitution, after Rosa Dartle rants at her. She accompanies her uncle to Australia.
*Ham Peggotty – The good-natured nephew of Mr Peggotty who is tall and strong, and becomes a skilled boat builder. He is the fiancé of Emily before she leaves him for Steerforth. His aunt, (Clara) Peggotty, looks after Ham once Emily is gone. When a fierce storm at sea off Yarmouth demasts a merchant ship from the south, Ham attempts to rescue the crew, but is drowned by the ferocity of the waves before he can reach anyone. News of his death, a day before Emily and Mr Peggotty&#x27;s emigration, is withheld from his family to enable them to leave without hesitation or remorse.
*Mrs Gummidge – The widow of Daniel Peggotty&#x27;s partner, who is taken in and supported by Daniel after his partner&#x27;s death. She is a self-described &quot;lone, lorn creetur&quot; who spends much of her time pining for &quot;the old &#x27;un&quot; (her late husband). After Emily runs away with Steerforth, she renounces her self-pity and becomes Daniel and Ham&#x27;s primary caretaker. She too emigrates to Australia with Daniel and Emily. In Australia, when she receives a marriage proposal, she responds by attacking the unlucky suitor with a bucket.
*Martha Endell – A young woman, once Little Emily&#x27;s friend, who flees to London after an unspecified disgrace. She falls into prostitution and is stopped from suicide by Daniel Peggotty and David, resolving to help them recover Emily. She emigrates with the Peggotty family to Australia, where she marries an outback farmer.
*Mr Creakle – The harsh headmaster of young David&#x27;s boarding school, Salem House, who is assisted by the one-legged Tungay. Mr Creakle is a friend of Mr Murdstone. He singles out David for extra torment at Murdstone&#x27;s request, but later treats him normally after David apologises to Murdstone. With a surprising amount of delicacy, Creakle&#x27;s wife breaks the news to David that his mother has died. Later, he becomes a Middlesex magistrate and is considered &#x27;enlightened&#x27; for his day. He runs his prison by the &quot;system&quot; and is portrayed with great sarcasm, as he thinks that his model inmates, Heep and Littimer, have changed their criminal ways because of his intervention.
*James Steerforth – A student at Creakle&#x27;s school who befriends young David, even as he takes over David&#x27;s money. He is condescending to other social classes, a snob who unhesitatingly takes advantage of his younger friends and uses his mother&#x27;s influence, going so far as to get Mr Mell dismissed from the school because Mell&#x27;s mother lives in an almshouse. Although he grows into a charming and handsome young man, he proves to be lacking in character when he seduces and later abandons Little Em&#x27;ly. He eventually drowns at Yarmouth in a fierce storm at sea, washing up on the shore after the merchant ship breaks apart.
*Tommy Traddles – David&#x27;s friend from Salem House. Traddles is one of the few boys who does not trust Steerforth and is notable for drawing skeletons on his slate. (David speculates that this is to cheer himself up with the macabre thought that his predicaments are only temporary.) He and David meet again later and become lifelong friends. Traddles works hard but faces great obstacles because of his lack of money and connections. He succeeds in making a name and a career for himself, becoming a Judge and marrying his true love, Sophy.
*Wilkins Micawber – A melodramatic, kind-hearted gentleman who has a way with words and eternal optimism. He befriends David as a young boy in London, taking him as a lodger. Micawber suffers from financial difficulty and spends time in a debtors&#x27; prison before moving his family briefly to Plymouth. Micawber meets David again, passing by the Heep household in Canterbury when David is taking tea there. Micawber takes a position at Wickfield and Heep. Thinking Micawber is weak-minded, Heep makes him an accomplice in several of his schemes, but Micawber turns the tables on his employer and is instrumental in his downfall. Micawber emigrates to Australia, where he enjoys a successful career as a sheep farmer and becomes a magistrate. He is based on Dickens&#x27;s father, John Dickens, who faced similar financial problems when Dickens was a child, but never emigrated.
*Emma Micawber – Wilkins Micawber&#x27;s wife and the mother of their five children. She comes from a wealthy family who disapprove of her husband, but she constantly protests that she will &quot;never leave Micawber!&quot;
*Mr Dick (Richard Babley) – A slightly deranged, rather childish but amiable man who lives with Betsey Trotwood; they are distant relatives. His madness is amply described; he claims to have the &quot;trouble&quot; of King Charles I in his head. He is fond of making gigantic kites and tries to write a &quot;Memorial&quot; (that is, a Petition – though on what subject is never revealed) but is unable to focus and finish it. Despite his limitations, Dick is able to see issues with a certain clarity. He proves to be not only a kind and loyal friend but also demonstrates a keen emotional intelligence, particularly when he helps Dr and Mrs Strong through a marriage crisis.
*Mr Wickfield – The widowed father of Agnes Wickfield and lawyer to Betsey Trotwood. While David attends school in Canterbury, he stays with the Wickfields until he graduates. Mr Wickfield feels guilty that, through his love, he has hurt his daughter by keeping her too close to himself. This sense of guilt leads him to drink. His apprentice Uriah Heep uses the information to lead Mr Wickfield down a slippery slope, encouraging the alcoholism and feelings of guilt, and eventually convincing him that he has committed improprieties while inebriated, and blackmailing him. He is saved by Mr Micawber, and his friends consider him to have become a better man through the experience.
*Agnes Wickfield – Mr Wickfield&#x27;s mature and lovely daughter and close friend of David since he began school at Dr Strong&#x27;s in Canterbury. Agnes nurtures an unrequited love for David for many years but never tells him, helping and advising him through his infatuation with, and marriage to Dora. After David returns to England, he realises his feelings for her, and she becomes David&#x27;s second wife and mother of their children.
*Uriah Heep – The main antagonist of the novel&#x27;s second half, Heep serves first as clerk from age 11 or 12; at age 15 he meets Copperfield and a few years later becomes partner to Mr Wickfield. He presents himself as self-deprecating and talks of being &quot;umble&quot;, but gradually reveals his wicked and twisted character. He gains power over Wickfield but is exposed by Wilkins Micawber and Traddles, who have gathered evidence that Uriah committed many acts of fraud. By forging Mr Wickfield&#x27;s signature, he misappropriates the personal wealth of the Wickfield family, together with portfolios entrusted to them by others, including funds belonging to Betsey Trotwood. He fools Wickfield into thinking he has himself committed this act while drunk, and then blackmails him. Heep is defeated but not prosecuted. He is later imprisoned for a separate fraud on the Bank of England. He nurtures a deep hatred of David Copperfield and of many others, though in some ways he is a mirror to David, wanting to get ahead and to marry the boss&#x27;s daughter.
*Mrs Heep – Uriah&#x27;s mother, who is as sycophantic as her son. She has instilled in him his lifelong tactic of pretending to be subservient to achieve his goals, and even as his schemes fall apart she begs him to save himself by &quot;being &#x27;umble&quot;.
*Dr Strong and Annie Strong – Director and assistant of the school David attends in Canterbury. Dr Strong&#x27;s main concern is to work on his dictionary, where, at the end of the novel, he has reached the letter D. The Doctor is 62 when David meets him, and married about a year to Annie, considerably younger than her husband. In this happy loving couple, each one cares more about the other than about themselves. The depth of their feeling allows them to defeat the efforts of Uriah Heep in trying to break their union.
*Jack Maldon – A cousin and childhood sweetheart of Annie Strong. He continues to bear affection for her and assumes she will leave Dr Strong for him. Instead, Dr Strong helps him financially and in finding a position. Maldon is charming, and after his time in India, he ends up in London society, in a social circle with Julia Mills. They live a life that seems empty to the adult David Copperfield.
*Julia Mills – She is a friend of Dora who supports Dora&#x27;s romance with David Copperfield; she moves to India when her father gets a new position. She marries a wealthy Scottish man, a &quot;Scotch Croesus&quot;, and lives in London in the end. She thinks of little besides money.
*Mrs Markleham – Annie&#x27;s mother, nicknamed &quot;The Old Soldier&quot; by her husband&#x27;s students for her stubbornness. She tries to take pecuniary advantage of her son-in-law Dr Strong in every way possible, to Annie&#x27;s sorrow.
*Mrs Emma Steerforth – The wealthy widowed mother of James Steerforth. She dotes on her son to the point of being completely blind to his faults. When Steerforth disgraces his family and the Peggottys by running off with Em&#x27;ly, Mrs Steerforth blames Em&#x27;ly for corrupting her son, rather than accept that James has disgraced an innocent girl. The news of her son&#x27;s death destroys her. She lives on, but she never recovers from the shock.
*Rosa Dartle – Steerforth&#x27;s cousin, a bitter, sarcastic spinster who lives with Mrs Steerforth. She is secretly in love with Steerforth and blames others such as Emily and Steerforth&#x27;s mother for corrupting him. She is described as being thin and displays a visible scar on her lip caused by Steerforth in one of his violent rages as a child.
*Francis Spenlow – A lawyer, employer of David as a proctor and the father of Dora Spenlow. He dies suddenly of a heart attack while driving his phaeton home. After his death, it is revealed that he is heavily in debt, and left no will.
*Dora Spenlow – The adorable daughter of Mr Spenlow who becomes David&#x27;s first wife after a long courtship. She is described as being impractical and has many similarities to David&#x27;s mother. In their first year of marriage, David learns their differences as to keeping a house in order. Dora does not learn firmness, but remains herself, affectionate with David and attached to her lapdog, Jip. She is not unaware of their differences, and asks David, whom she calls &quot;Doady&quot;, to think of her as a &quot;child-wife&quot;. She suffers a miscarriage, which begins a long illness from which she dies with David&#x27;s childhood friend and later second wife Agnes Wickfield at her side.
*Littimer – Steerforth&#x27;s obsequious valet (repeatedly described as being &quot;respectable&quot;), who is instrumental in aiding his seduction of Emily. Littimer is always polite and correct but his condescending manner intimidates David, who always feels as if Littimer is reminding him how young he is. He later winds up in prison for embezzlement, and his manners allow him to con his way to the stature of Model Prisoner in Creakle&#x27;s establishment.
*Miss Mowcher – a dwarf and Steerforth&#x27;s hairdresser. Though she participates in Steerforth&#x27;s circle as a witty and glib gossip, she is strong against the discomfort others might feel associated with her dwarfism. She is later instrumental in Littimer&#x27;s arrest.
*Mr Mell – A poor teacher at Salem House. He takes David to Salem House and is the only adult there who is kind to him. His mother lives in a workhouse, and Mell supports her with his wages. When Steerforth discovers this information from David, he uses it to get Creakle to fire Mell. Near the end of the novel, Copperfield discovers in an Australian newspaper that Mell has emigrated and is now Doctor Mell of Colonial Salem-House Grammar School, Port Middlebay, married with children.
*Sophy Crewler – One of a family of ten daughters, Sophy runs the household and takes care of all her sisters. She and Traddles are engaged to be married, but her family has made Sophy so indispensable that they do not want her to part from them with Traddles. The pair do eventually marry and settle down happily, and Sophy proves to be an invaluable aid in Traddles&#x27;s legal career, while still helping her sisters.
*Mr Sharp – The chief teacher of Salem House, he has more authority than Mr Mell. He looks weak, both in health and character; his head seems to be very heavy for him; he walks on one side, and has a big nose.
*Mr Jorkins – The rarely seen partner of Mr Spenlow. Spenlow uses him as a scapegoat for any unpopular decision he chooses to make, painting Jorkins as an inflexible tyrant, but Jorkins is, in fact, a meek and timid nonentity who, when confronted, takes the same track by blaming his inability to act on Mr Spenlow.

== Autobiographical novel==
===Fragments of autobiography===
Between 1845 and 1848, Dickens wrote fragments of autobiography, excerpts of which he showed to his wife and John Forster. Then in 1855 he made an attempt at revising it. This was a failure because, as he tells his first love Maria Beadnell (now Mrs Winter), when he began dealing with his youthful love for her, &quot;I lost courage and burned the rest&quot;. Paul Schlicke points out that in fact not all the pages have gone through the flames and that, as Dickens began writing &quot;David Copperfield&quot; some pages were unearthed. Proof of this is found in the eleventh chapter of the novel: &quot;I begin Life on my own Account and don&#x27;t like it&quot;, where the story of Dickens&#x27;s experience at the Warren Shoe Factory is told almost verbatim, with the only change, &quot;Mr Micawber&quot; instead of &quot;my father&quot;. John Forster also published substantial extracts relating to this period in Dickens&#x27;s biography, including a paragraph devoted to Wellington House College, which corresponds with the second stage of childhood recounted in the novel. Thus Dickens looks back on his painful past, already evoked by the martyrdom of Little Paul in &quot;Dombey and Son&quot;, though voiced by an omniscient narrator in that earlier novel. Until Forster published his biography of Dickens in 1872–1874, no one knew that Dickens had worked in a factory as a child, not even his wife, until Dickens wrote it down and gave the papers to Forster in 1847. The first generations of readers did not know this part of David Copperfield&#x27;s story began like an incident in the author&#x27;s life.

===The autobiographical dimension===
If &quot;David Copperfield&quot; has come to be Dickens&#x27;s &quot;darling&quot;, it is because it is the most autobiographical of all his novels. Some of the most painful episodes of his life are barely disguised; others appear indirectly, termed &quot;oblique revelations&quot; by Paul Davis. However, Dickens himself wrote to Forster that the book is not a pure autobiography, but &quot;a very complicated weaving of truth and invention&quot;.

==== The autobiographical material ====
The most important autobiographical material concerns the months that Dickens, still a child, spent at the Warren factory, his diligence with his first love, Maria Beadnell (see Catherine Dickens and Ellen Ternan), and finally his career as a journalist and writer. As pointed out by his biographer and friend John Forster, these episodes are essentially factual: the description of forced labour to which David is subjected at Murdstone and Grinby reproduces verbatim the autobiographical fragments entrusted to his friend; David&#x27;s fascination with Dora Spenlow is similar to that inspired by the capricious Maria; the major stages of his career, from his apprenticeship at Doctors&#x27; Commons to writing his first novel, via the shorthand reporting of parliamentary procedures, also follow those of its creator.

However, this material, like the other autobiographical aspects of the novel, is not systematically reproduced as such. The cruel Mr Murdstone is very different from the real James Lamert, cousin to Dickens, being the stepson of Mrs Dickens&#x27;s mother&#x27;s sister, who lived with the family in Chatham and Camden Town, and who had found for the young Charles the place of tagger in the shoe factory he managed for his brother-in-law George. The end of this episode looks nothing like what happens in the novel; in reality, contrary to the desire of his mother that he continue to work, it is his father who took him out of the warehouse to send him to school. Contrary to Charles&#x27;s frustrated love for Maria Beadnell, who pushed him back in front of his parents&#x27; opposition, David, in the novel, marries Dora Spenlow and, with satisfaction &quot;ex post facto&quot;, writes Paul Davis, virtually &quot;kills&quot; the recalcitrant stepfather. Finally, David&#x27;s literary career seems less agitated than that of Dickens, and his results are much less spectacular. David&#x27;s natural modesty alone does not explain all these changes; Paul Davis expresses the opinion that Dickens recounts his life as he would have liked it, and along with &quot;conscious artistry&quot;, Dickens knows how to borrow data, integrate them to his original purpose and transform them according to the novelistic necessities, so that &quot;In the end, Copperfield is David&#x27;s autobiography, not Dickens&#x27;s&quot;.

==Sources and context==
===Dickens&#x27;s past===
&quot;David Copperfield&quot; is the contemporary of two major memory-based works, William Wordsworth&#x27;s &quot;The Prelude&quot; (1850), an autobiographical poem about the formative experiences of his youth and Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;In Memoriam&quot; (1850) which eulogises the memory of his friend, Arthur Hallam. There is Wordsworth&#x27;s romantic questioning on the personal development of the individual and there is Tennyson&#x27;s Victorian confrontation with change and doubt. According to Andrew Sanders, &quot;David Copperfield&quot; reflects both types of response, which give this novel the privileged position of representing the hinge of the century.

The memories of Dickens are, according to Paul Schlicke, remarkably transmuted into fiction. The experience Dickens lived, as the son of a brazen impenitent, is celebrated through the comic figure of Wilkins Micawber. Dickens&#x27;s youthful passion for Maria Beadnell resurfaces with tenderness, in the form of David&#x27;s impractical marriage with Dora Spenlow. Dickens&#x27;s decision to make David a novelist emphasises how he used this book to re-invent himself as a man and artist, &quot;The world would not take another Pickwick from me, but we can be cheerful and merry, and with a little more purpose in us&quot;. If the preoccupation with the adventures of a hero, associated with a parade of comic or grotesque characters, looks back to Dickens&#x27;s earlier novels, the interest in personal development, the pessimistic atmosphere and the complex structure of &quot;Copperfield&quot; foreshadow other novels.

Despite never living there, Dickens knew the City of Canterbury well and includes numerous references to it. David Copperfield regularly visits the cathedral services at Canterbury Cathedral, and Mr Micawber wants his son to become a chorister. The Guildhall is mentioned when David Copperfield is asked by the barrister to visit. Dr Strong and Annie Markleham get married at St Alphege church, which is also situated prominently in Canterbury.

===Contemporaneous novels===
In 1847, &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s first-person narrative, was acclaimed as soon as it was published. Unlike Thackeray, who adored it, Dickens claims years later never to have read it. True or false, he had encountered Elizabeth Gaskell&#x27;s &quot;Mary Barton&quot;, a novel that called for understanding and sympathy in a class-eaten society. Thackeray&#x27;s &quot;Pendennis&quot; was serialised at the same time as &quot;David Copperfield&quot; and it depicts its hero&#x27;s personal and social journey from the countryside to the city. A rivalry existed between the two writers, though it preoccupied Thackeray more than Dickens. The most direct literary influence is &quot;obviously Carlyle&quot; who, in a lecture given in 1840, the year of his meeting with Dickens, on &quot;On Heroes, Hero-Worship&quot; and &quot;the Heroic in History&quot;, claims that the most important modern character is &quot;the hero as a man of letters&quot;. This is David&#x27;s destiny, through experience, perseverance and seriousness.

==Development of the novel==
===First inspirations===

On 7 January 1849, Dickens visited Norwich and Yarmouth in Norfolk, with two close friends, John Leech (1817–1864) and Mark Lemon (1809–1870). Leech was an illustrator at &quot;Punch&quot;, a satirical magazine, and the first illustrator for &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; by Dickens in 1843. Lemon was a founding editor of &quot;Punch&quot;, and soon a contributor to &quot;Household Words&quot;, the weekly magazine Dickens was starting up; he co-authored &quot;Mr Nightingale&#x27;s Diary&quot;, a farce, with Dickens in 1851. The two towns, especially the second, became important in the novel, and Dickens informed Forster that Yarmouth seemed to him to be &quot;the strangest place in the world&quot; and that he would &quot;certainly try my hand at it&quot;. During a walk in the vicinity of Yarmouth, Dickens noticed a sign indicating the small locality of Blundeston, which became in his novel the village of &quot;Blunderstone&quot; where David is born and spends his childhood.

A week after his arrival in Yarmouth, his sixth son, Henry Fielding Dickens, was named after Henry Fielding, his favourite past author. Per Forster, Dickens refers to Fielding &quot;as a kind of homage to the novel he was about to write&quot;.

As always with Dickens, when a writing project began, he was agitated, melancholic, &quot;even deeper than the customary birth pangs of other novels&quot;; as always, he hesitated about the title, and his working notes contain seventeen variants, &quot;Charles Copperfield&quot; included. After several attempts, he stopped on &quot;The Copperfield Survey of the World as it Rolled&quot;, a title that he retained until 19 April. When Forster pointed out that his hero, now called David, has his own initials transposed, Dickens was intrigued and declared that this was a manifestation of his fate. He was not yet sure of his pen: &quot;Though I know what I want to do, I am lumbering like a train wagon&quot;, he told Forster.

===No general plan, but an inspired novel===

Contrary to the method previously used for &quot;Dombey and Son&quot;, Dickens did not elaborate an overall plan and often wrote the summary of a chapter after completing it. Four character names were found at the last moment: Traddles, Barkis, Creakle and Steerforth; the profession of David remains uncertain until the eighth issue (printed in December 1849, containing Chapters 22–24, in which David chooses to be trained as a proctor); and Paul Schlicke notes that the future of Dora was still not determined on 17 May 1850 (when 37 chapters had been published in the first 12 monthly instalments). Other major aspects of the novel, however, were immediately fixed, such as David&#x27;s meeting with Aunt Betsey, Emily&#x27;s fall or Agnes&#x27;s role as the &quot;real&quot; heroine of the story.

Once launched, Dickens becomes &quot;quite confident&quot;. The most difficult thing was to insert &quot;what I know so well&quot;, his experience at the Warren factory; once the threads were woven, however, the truth mixed with fiction, he exulted and congratulated himself in a letter to Forster. From now on, he wrote in this letter, the story &quot;bore him irresistibly along&quot;. Never, it seems, was he in the grip of failures of inspiration, so &quot;ardent [is his] sympathy with the creatures of the fancy which always made real to him their sufferings or sorrows.&quot;

Changes in detail occur during the composition: on 22 August 1849, while staying on the Isle of Wight for a family vacation, he changed on the advice of Forster, the theme of the obsession of Mr Dick, a secondary character in the novel. This theme was originally &quot;a bull in a china shop&quot; and became &quot;King Charles&#x27;s head&quot; in a nod to the bicentenary of the execution of Charles I of England.

===Last incidents in the writing===
Although plunged into the writing of his novel, Dickens set out to create a new journal, &quot;Household Words&quot;, the first issue of which appeared on 31 March 1850. This daunting task, however, did not seem to slow down the writing of &quot;David Copperfield&quot;: I am &quot;busy as a bee&quot;, he writes happily to the actor William Macready.

A serious incident occurred in December: Mrs Jane Seymour Hill, chiropractor to Mrs Dickens, raised the threat of prosecution, because she recognised herself in the portrait of Miss Mowcher; Dickens did not do badly, gradually modifying the psychology of the character by making her less of a caricature and, at the very end of the novel, by making her a friend of the protagonist, whereas at the beginning she served rather contrary purposes. This was, writes Harry Stone, &quot;the only major departure from his original plans&quot;.

His third daughter was born on 16 August 1850, called Dora Annie Dickens, the same name as his character&#x27;s first wife. The baby died nine months later after the last serial was issued and the book was published.

Dickens marked the end of his manuscript on 21 October 1850 and felt both torn and happy like every time he finished a novel: &quot;Oh, my dear Forster, if I were to say half of what &quot;Copperfield&quot; makes me feel to-night, how strangely, even to you, I should be turned inside out! I seem to be sending some part of myself into the Shadowy World.&quot;

At first glance, the work is modelled in the loose and somewhat disjointed way of &quot;personal histories&quot; that was very popular in the United Kingdom of the 18th century; but in reality, &quot;David Copperfield&quot; is a carefully structured and unified novel. It begins, like other novels by Dickens, with a rather bleak painting of the conditions of childhood in Victorian England, notoriously when the troublesome children are parked in infamous boarding schools, then he strives to trace the slow social and intimate ascent of a young man who, painfully providing for the needs of his good aunt while continuing his studies, ends up becoming a writer: the story, writes Paul Davis, of &quot;a Victorian everyman seeking self-understanding&quot;.

===Publication in monthly instalments===
&quot;The Personal History, Adventures, Experience, and Observation of David Copperfield the Younger, of Blunderstone Rookery&quot; was published from 1 May 1849 to 1 November 1850 in 19 monthly one-shilling instalments, containing 32 pages of text and two illustrations by Hablot Knight Browne (&quot;Phiz&quot;), with a title cover simplified to &quot;The Personal History of David Copperfield&quot;. The last instalment was a double-number.

==Point of view==
Whatever the borrowings from Dickens&#x27;s own life, the reader knows as an essential precondition, that &quot;David Copperfield&quot; is a novel and not an autobiography; a work with fictional events and characters – including the hero-narrator – who are creations of Dickens&#x27;s imagination.

=== First person narrator ===
The use of the first person determines the point of view: the narrator Copperfield, is a recognised writer, married to Agnes for more than ten years, who has decided to speak in public about his past life. This recreation, in itself an important act, can only be partial and also biased, since, &quot;a priori&quot;, Copperfield is the only viewpoint and the only voice; not enjoying the prerogatives of the third person, omnipotence, ubiquity, clairvoyance, he relates only what he witnessed or participated in: all the characters appear in his presence or, failing that, he learns through hearsay, before being subjected to his pen through the prism of his conscience, deformed by the natural deficit of his perception and accentuated by the selective filter of memory. Story teller and teacher, Copperfield does not let the facts speak for themselves, but constantly asserts himself as master of the narrative game, and he intervenes, explains, interprets and comments. His point of view is that of the adult he has become, as he expresses himself just as he is writing. At the end of his book, he feels a writer&#x27;s pride to evoke &quot;the thread[s] in the web I have spun&quot;.

Gareth Cordery writes that &quot;if &quot;David Copperfield&quot; is the paradigmatic Bildungsroman, it is also the quintessential novel of memory&quot; and as such, according to Angus Wilson, the equal of Marcel Proust&#x27;s &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot; (&quot;À la recherche du temps perdu&quot;). The memory of the hero engages so intensely with his memories that the past seems present:

How well I recollect the kind of day it was! I smell the fog that hung about the place; I see the hoar-frost, ghostly, through it; I feel my rimy hair fall clammy on my cheek; I look along the dim perspective of the schoolroom, with a sputtering candle here and there to light up the foggy morning, and the breath of the boys wreathing and smoking in the raw cold as they blow upon their fingers, and rap their feet upon the floor.

In such passages, which punctuate the retrospective chapters, the relived moment replaces the lived, the historical present seals the collapse of the original experience and the recreation of a here and now that seizes the entire field of consciousness. Sometimes this resurrected experience is more vivid than reality; so, in Chapter 41, about Traddles&#x27;s face, he says: &quot;His honest face, he looked at me with a serio-comic shake of his head impresses me more in the remembrance than it did in the reality.&quot; These are &quot;sacred moments&quot;, writes Gareth Cordery, which Copperfield has carefully guarded in &quot;the treasure chambers&quot; of his memory, where sings &quot;the music of time&quot;: &quot;secret prose, that sense of a mind speaking to itself with no one there to listen&quot;.

=== Commentary via the illustrations ===

Without being Dickens, this narrator, Copperfield, is very like him and often becomes his spokesperson. It adds to his point of view, directly or indirectly, that of the author, without there necessarily being total match between the two. As such, Copperfield serves as &quot;medium&quot;, mirror and also screen, Dickens sometimes subverting his speech to get to the forefront or, on the contrary, hide behind this elegant delegate to the nimble pen. Dickens&#x27;s voice, however, is in general well concealed and, according to Gareth Cordery, the most difficult to detect because mostly present by implication. To help hear his voice, he adds, it is advisable to turn to Phiz, whose illustrations bring a point of view which is not always in agreement with that of Copperfield. For example, in chapter 21, the two friends arrive by surprise at the Peggotty home, and Copperfield presents Steerforth to Emily at the very moment when her betrothal with Ham has just been announced. This sudden intrusion stops the girl as she has just jumped from Ham&#x27;s arms to nestle in those of Mr Peggotty, a sign, says Cordery in passing, that the promise of marriage is as much for the uncle as for the nephew. The text remains brief but Phiz interprets, anticipates the events, denounces even the future guilt of Copperfield: all eyes are on the girl, her bonnet, emblem of her social aspirations and her next wanderings with Steerforth, is ready to be seized. Copperfield, dressed as a gentleman, stands in the doorway, one finger pointing at Steerforth who is taller by one head, the other measuring the gap between Ham and Dan Peggotty, as if offering Emily to his friend. Emily, meanwhile, still has her head turned to Ham but the body is withdrawn and the look has become both challenging and provocative. Phiz brings together in a single image a whole bunch of unwritten information, which Dickens approved and probably even suggested.

===Reader&#x27;s insight===

A third perspective is the point of view of the discerning reader who, although generally carried away by sympathy for the narrator&#x27;s self-interested pleading, does not remain blissfully ignorant and ends up recognizing the faults of the man and of the writer, just as the reader also learns to identify and gauge the covert interventions of the author.

The discerning reader listens to the adult Copperfield and hears what this adult wants or does not want them to hear. &quot;Even though this manuscript is intended for no eyes but mine&quot;, (chapter 42) the book exists, and the reader becomes &quot;ipso facto&quot; a &quot;father-confessor&quot;, knowing how to judge and even, at times, to doubt the sincerity of the emotion expressed. So, when Dora dies, the reader sees that the topic of grief is dropped in a hurry, as if Copperfield had more important things to do than to indulge in sorrow: &quot;this is not the time at which I am to enter a state of mind beneath its load of sorrow&quot;, which creates a question and an embarrassment: is Copperfield protecting himself from his confusion, or does he shed some crocodile tears for form?

Copperfield also examines some of his most culpable weaknesses, such as unconscious connivance (his &quot;own unconscious part&quot;) in the defilement of the Peggotty home by Steerforth, which he remains forever incapable of opposing: &quot;I believe that if I had been brought face to face with him, I could not have uttered one reproach.&quot;(chapter 32) The same treatment is given to his childhood love, his so much idealised Emily, who, once &quot;fallen&quot;, is expelled from his consciousness to the point where his last comment, when he stealthily sees her aboard the ship leaving for Australia, is &quot;a masterpiece of narrative duplicity&quot;: far from seeing in her what she has become, a real woman, he takes refuge behind the image of a pathetic religious icon elegantly allowing him to remove his own guilt for betraying her.

These underground currents are thus revealed in David&#x27;s psychological struggle, Gareth Cordery concludes, currents that his narrative unconsciously attempts to disguise.

==Recapitulation of plot structure==
=== The plot line===
The story is a road from which different paths leave. The road is that of David&#x27;s life, the main plot; the branches are born of meetings with him and lead to several secondary intrigues taken more or less far along. Each is represented by an important figure: Mr Micawber, Steerforth, little Emily, Uriah Heep; there are side stories, that of Martha Endell, Rosa Dartle, and, along the main road, stretch some parallel paths on which the reader is from time to time invited: the Traddles, Betsey Trotwood, the Peggotty family, Dan and Ham in particular, Peggotty herself remaining from start to finish intimately related to David. The different tracks do not move away from the main avenue, and when they do, a narrative &quot;forceps&quot; brings them together again. Hence the retrospective chapters and the ultimate recapitulation were written.

===The necessary summaries===

The narrative is linear in appearance, as is usual in traditional first-person form. It covers the narrator&#x27;s life until the day he decides to put an end to his literary endeavor. However, whole sections of his life are summarised in a few paragraphs, or sometimes just a sentence or two, indicating that three or ten years have passed, or that Dora is dead, necessary to keep the story moving along. Thus, the long stay of reflection in Switzerland which leads to the recognition of love for Agnes, or the lapse of time before the final chapter, are all blanks in the story. Besides the hero, this story concerns important secondary characters such as Mr Micawber or Uriah Heep, or Betsey Trotwood and Traddles, the few facts necessary for a believable story are parsimoniously distilled in the final chapters: an impromptu visit to a prison, the unexpected return of Dan Peggotty from the Antipodes; so many false surprises for the narrator who needs them to complete each person&#x27;s personal story. As such, the epilogue that represents the last chapter (Ch 64) is a model of the genre, a systematic review, presumably inspired by his memory, without true connection. There is the desire to finish with each one, with forced exclamations and ecstatic observations, scrolling through the lives of those who are frozen in time: Dick with his &quot;Memorial&quot; and his kite, Dr Strong and his dictionary, and as a bonus, the news of David&#x27;s &quot;least child&quot;, which implies that there have been other children between him and eldest child Agnes of whom the reader has never heard by name. So also goes the story of Dan Peggotty relating the sad tale of his niece. The four chapters called &quot;Retrospect&quot; (Chapter 18: &quot;A Retrospect&quot;, Chapter 43: &quot;Another Retrospect&quot;, Chapter 53: &quot;Another Retrospect&quot; and Chapter 64: &quot;A Last Retrospect&quot;) are placed at strategic moments of the general discourse, which play a catch-up role more than one of meditation by the narrator, without venturing into event details. Here, the narration has disappeared, it has given way to a list, an enumeration of events.

=== Restructuring &quot;a posteriori&quot; ===
Dickens&#x27;s approach, as shown in &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, does not escape what :fr:Georges Gusdorf calls &quot;the original sin of autobiography&quot;, that is to say a restructuring &quot;a posteriori&quot; and in this, paradoxically, it demonstrates its authenticity. It consists of splitting one&#x27;s life into parts, choosing decisive phases, identifying an evolution and endowing them with a direction and then a meaning, whereas, from day to day, existence has been lived as a cluster of shapeless perceptions requiring an immediate adaptation, that captures at best in the novel the use of the historical present generally adopted by Dickens. It is a succession of autonomous moments which do not end up amalgamating in a coherent whole and that connect the tenuous thread of the &quot;I&quot; recognizing each other. In this reconstruction, one part of truth and the other of poetry, the famous &quot;Dichtung und Wahrheit&quot; (&quot;From my Life: Poetry and Truth; 1811–1833&quot;), autobiography of Goethe, there is the obligatory absence of objectivity, the promotion of oblivion as an integral part of memory, the ruling power of the subjectivity of time found.

Thus, to use George Gusdorf&#x27;s words again, &quot;David Copperfield&quot; appears as a &quot;second reading of a man&#x27;s experience&quot;, in this case, Charles Dickens, when he reached the fullness of his career, tried to give &quot;a meaning to his legend&quot;.

==Themes==
This novel&#x27;s main theme arises from the fact that it is a bildungsroman, a literary genre that focuses on the psychological and moral growth of the protagonist from youth to adulthood, which is common in Dickens&#x27;s novels, and in which character change is extremely important. The changes involve David leaving past selves behind on the way to maturity. Other important themes relate especially to Dickens&#x27;s social concerns, and his desire for reform. This includes the plight of so-called &quot;fallen women&quot;, and prostitutes, as well as the attitude of middle-class society to these women; the status of women in marriage; the rigid class structure; the prison system; educational standards, and emigration to the colonies of what was becoming the British Empire. The latter was a way for individuals to escape some of the rigidity of British society and start anew. Some of these subjects are directly satirized, while others are worked into the novel in more complex ways by Dickens.

===Bildungsroman===
====Different names====

Copperfield&#x27;s path to maturity is marked by the different names assigned to him: his mother calls him &quot;Davy&quot;; Murdstone calls him as &quot;Brooks of Sheffield&quot;; for Peggotty&#x27;s family, he is &quot;Mas&#x27;r Davy&quot;; en route to boarding school from Yarmouth, he appears as &quot;Master Murdstone&quot;; at Murdstone and Grinby, he is known as &quot;Master Copperfield&quot;; Mr Micawber is content with &quot;Copperfield&quot;; for Steerforth he is &quot;Daisy&quot;; he becomes &quot;Mister Copperfield&quot; with Uriah Heep; and &quot;Trotwood&quot;, soon shortened to &quot;Trot&quot; for Aunt Betsey; Mrs Crupp deforms his name into &quot;Mr Copperfull&quot;; and for Dora he is &quot;Doady&quot;. While striving to earn his real name once and for all, this plethora of names reflects the fluidity of Copperfield&#x27;s personal and social relationships, and obscure his real identity. It is by writing his own story, and giving him his name in the title, that Copperfield can finally assert who he is.

==== A series of lives ====
David&#x27;s life can be seen as a series of lives, each one in radical disjunction from what follows, writes Paul Davis. The young boy in the warehouse differs from Blunderstone Rookery&#x27;s child, or Salem House student, and overall David strives to keep these parts of himself disconnected from each other. For example, in Chapter 17, while attending Canterbury School, he met Mr Micawber at Uriah Heep&#x27;s, and a sudden terror gripped him that Heep could connect him, such as he is today, and the abandoned child who lodged with the Micawber family in London.

So many mutations indicate the name changes, which are sometimes received with relief: &quot;Trotwood Copperfield&quot;, when he finds refuge in Dover at his Aunt Betsey&#x27;s house, so the narrator writes, &quot;Thus I began my new life, in a new name, and with everything new about me.&quot; Then, he realised &quot;that a remoteness had come upon the old Blunderstone life&quot; and &quot;that a curtain had for ever fallen on my life at Murdstone and Grinby&#x27;s&quot;.

There is a process of forgetfulness, a survival strategy developed by memory, which poses a major challenge to the narrator; his art, in fact, depends on the ultimate reconciliation of differences in order to free and preserve the unified identity of his being a man.

==== &quot;Will I be the hero of my own life?&quot; ====
David opens his story with a question: Will I be the hero of my own life? This means that he does not know where his approach will lead him, that writing itself will be the test. As Paul Davis puts it, &quot;In this Victorian quest narrative, the pen might be lighter than the sword, and the reader will be left to judge those qualities of the man and the writer that constitute heroism.

However, question implies an affirmation: it is Copperfield, and no one else, who will determine his life, the future is delusory, since the games are already played, the life has been lived, with the novel being only the story. Copperfield is not always the hero of his life, and not always the hero of his story, as some characters have a stronger role than him, Besides Steerforth, Heep, Micawber, for example, he often appears passive and lightweight. Hence, concludes Paul Davis, the need to read his life differently; it is more by refraction through other characters that the reader has a true idea of the &quot;hero&quot; of the story. What do these three men reveal to him, and also to Dora, whom he marries? Another possible yardstick is a comparison with the other two &quot;writers&quot; of the novel, Dr Strong and Mr Dick. The dictionary of Strong will never be completed and, as a story of a life, will end with the death of its author. As for Mr Dick, his autobiographical project constantly raises the question of whether he can transcend the incoherence and indecision of his subject-narrator. Will he be able to take the reins, provide a beginning, a middle, an end? Will he succeed in unifying the whole, in overcoming the trauma of the past, his obsession with the decapitated royal head, so as to make sense of the present and find a direction for the future? According to Paul Davis, only Copperfield succeeds in constructing a whole of his life, including suffering and failure, as well as successes, and that is &quot;one measure of his heroism as a writer&quot;.

==== The weight of the past ====
The past &quot;speaks&quot; especially to David, &quot;a child of close observation&quot; (chapter 2); the title of this chapter is: &quot;I observe&quot;, and as an adult he is endowed with a remarkable memory. So much so that the story of his childhood is realised so concretely that the narrator, like the reader, sometimes forgets that it is a lived past and not a present that is given to see. The past tense verb is often the &quot;preterite&quot; for the narrative, and the sentences are often short independent propositions, each one stating a fact. Admittedly, the adult narrator intervenes to qualify or provide an explanation, without, however, taking precedence over the child&#x27;s vision. And sometimes, the story is prolonged by a reflection on the functioning of the memory. So, again in chapter 2, the second and third paragraphs comment on the first memory of the two beings surrounding David, his mother, and Peggotty:

I believe I can remember these two at a little distance apart, dwarfed to my sight by stooping or kneeling on the floor, and I going unsteadily from the one to the other. I have an impression on my mind, which I cannot distinguish from actual remembrance, of the touch of Peggotty&#x27;s forefinger as she used to hold it out to me, and of its being roughened by needlework, like a pocket nutmeg-grater.
This may be fancy, though I think the memory of most of us can go further back into such times than many of us suppose; just as I believe the power of observation in numbers of very young children to be quite wonderful for its closeness and accuracy. Indeed, I think that most grown men who are remarkable in this respect may with greater propriety be said not to have lost the faculty than to have acquired it; the rather, as I generally observe such men to retain a certain freshness, and gentleness, and capacity of being pleased, which are also an inheritance they have preserved from their childhood.

David thus succeeds, as George Orwell puts it, in standing &quot;both inside and outside a child&#x27;s mind&quot;, a particularly important double vision effect in the first chapters. The perspective of the child is combined with that of the adult narrator who knows that innocence will be violated and the feeling of security broken. Thus, even before the intrusion of Mr Murdstone as step-father or Clara&#x27;s death, the boy feels &quot;intimations of mortality&quot;. In the second chapter for example, when David spends a day with Mr Murdstone, during the first episode of &quot;Brooks of Sheffield&quot; in which, first blow to his confidence, he realises little by little that Mr Murdstone and his comrade Quinion are mocking him badly:
&#x27;That&#x27;s Davy,&#x27; returned Mr Murdstone.
&#x27;Davy who?&#x27; said the gentleman. &#x27;Jones?&#x27;
&#x27;Copperfield&#x27; said Mr Murdstone.
&#x27;What! Bewitching Mrs Copperfield&#x27;s incumbrance?&#x27; cried the gentleman. &#x27;The pretty little widow?&#x27;
&#x27;Quinion,&#x27; said Mr Murdstone, &#x27;take care, if you please. Somebody&#x27;s sharp.&#x27;
&#x27;Who is?&#x27; asked the gentleman laughing.
I looked up quickly, being curious to know.
&#x27;Only Brooks of Sheffield&#x27;, said Mr Murdstone.
I was quite relieved to find that it was only Brooks of Sheffield, for, at first, I really thought it was I.
There seemed to be something very comical in the reputation of Mr Brooks of Sheffield, for both the gentlemen laughed heartily when he was mentioned, and Mr Murdstone was a good deal amused also.

The final blow, brutal and irremediable this time, is the vision, in chapter 9, of his own reflection in his little dead brother lying on the breast of his mother: &quot;The mother who lay in the grave was the mother of my infancy; the little creature in her arms was myself, as I had once been, hushed forever on her bosom&quot;.

====A series of male models for David====
David Copperfield is a posthumous child, that is, he was born after his father died. From birth, his aunt is the authority who stands in for the deceased father, and she decides Copperfield&#x27;s identity by abandoning him because he is not female. His first years are spent with women, two Claras, his mother and Peggotty, which, according to Paul Davis, &quot;undermines his sense of masculinity&quot;. Hence a sensitivity that the same critic calls &quot;feminine&quot;, made-up of a lack of confidence, naive innocence and anxiety, like that of his mother, who was herself an orphan. Steerforth is not mistaken, when from the outset he calls Copperfield &quot;Daisy&quot;–a flower of spring, symbol of innocent youth. To forge an identity as a man and learn how to survive in a world governed by masculine values, instinctively, he looks for a father figure who can replace that of the father he did not have.

Several male models will successively offer themselves to him: the adults Mr Murdstone, Mr Micawber and Uriah Heep, his comrades Steerforth and Traddles.

=====Mr Murdstone=====
Mr Murdstone darkens Copperfield&#x27;s life instead of enlightening him, because the principle of firmness which he champions, absolute novelty for the initial family unit, if he instills order and discipline, kills spontaneity and love. The resistance that Copperfield offers him is symbolic: opposing a usurper without effective legitimacy, he fails to protect his mother but escapes the straitjacket and achieves his independence. Mr Murdstone thus represents the anti-father, double negative of the one of which David was deprived, model &quot;a contrario&quot; of what it is not necessary to be.

=====Mr Micawber=====

The second surrogate father is just as ineffective, although of a diametrically opposed personality: it is Mr Micawber who, for his part, lacks firmness to the point of sinking into irresponsibility. Overflowing with imagination and love, in every way faithful and devoted, inveterate optimist, he eventually becomes, in a way, the child of David who helps him to alleviate his financial difficulties. The roles are reversed and, by the absurdity, David is forced to act as a man and to exercise adult responsibilities towards him. However, the Micawbers are not lacking in charm, the round Wilkins, of course, but also his dry wife, whose music helps her to live. Mrs Micawber has, since childhood, two songs in her repertoire, the Scottish &quot;The dashing white sergeant&quot; and the American lament &quot;The little Tafflin with the Silken Sash&quot;, whose attraction has decided her husband to &quot;win that woman or perish in the attempt&quot; In addition to the melodies that soothe and embellish, the words of the second, with her dream &quot;Should e&#x27;er the fortune be my lot to be made a wealthy bride!&quot; and her aphorism &quot;Like attracts like&quot; have become emblematic of the couple, one is the opposite of reality and the other the very definition of its harmony.

=====Uriah Heep=====
New avatar of this quest, Uriah Heep is &quot;a kind of negative mirror to David&quot;. Heep is clever at enlarging the pathos of his humble origins, for example, which ability he exploits shamelessly to attract sympathy and mask an unscrupulous ambition; while David, on the other hand, tends to suppress his modest past and camouflage his social ambitions under a veneer of worldly mistrust, prompting Paul Davis to conclude that, just as Mr Murdstone is adept at firmness, Heep, in addition to being a rascal, lacks the so-called feminine qualities of sensitivity which David does not lose.

=====Steerforth=====

For David, Steerforth represents all that Heep is not: born a gentleman, with no stated ambition or defined life plan, he has a natural presence and charisma that immediately give him scope and power. However, his failure as a model is announced well before the episode at Yarmouth where he seizes, like a thief, Little Emily before causing her loss in Italy. He already shows himself as he is, brutal, condescending, selfish and sufficient, towards Rosa Dartle, bruised by him for life, and Mr Mell who undergoes the assaults of his cruelty. The paradox is that even as he gauges his infamy, David remains from start to finish dazzled by Steerforth&#x27;s aristocratic ascendancy, even as he contemplates him drowning on Yarmouth Beach, &quot;lying with his head upon his arm, as I had often seen him at school&quot;.

=====Traddles=====
Now consider Traddles, the anti-Steerforth, the same age as the hero, not very brilliant at school, but wise enough to avoid the manipulations to which David succumbs. His attraction for moderation and reserve assures him the strength of character that David struggles to forge. Neither rich nor poor, he must also make a place for himself in the world, at which he succeeds by putting love and patience at the center of his priorities, the love that tempers the ambition and the patience that moderates the passion. His ideal is to achieve justice in his actions, which he ends up implementing in his profession practically. In the end, Traddles, in his supreme modesty, represents the best male model available to David.

There are others, Daniel Peggotty for example, all love and dedication, who goes in search of his lost niece and persists in mountains and valleys, beyond the seas and continents, to find her trace. Mr Peggotty is the anti-Murdstone par excellence, but his influence is rather marginal on David, as his absolute excellence, like the maternal perfection embodied by his sister Peggotty, makes him a character type more than an individual to refer to. There is also the carter Barkis, original, laconic and not without defects, but a man of heart. He too plays a role in the personal history of the hero, but in a fashion too episodic to be significant, especially since he dies well before the end of the story.

====The hard path to the right balance====

It is true that David&#x27;s personal story makes it more difficult for him to access the kind of equilibrium that Traddles presents, because it seems destined, according to Paul Davis, to reproduce the errors committed by his parents. So, without knowing it, he looks a lot like his late father, also named David, who, according to Aunt Betsey, had eyes only for the flower-women, and, as such, he finds himself as irresistibly attracted to Dora whose delicate and charming femininity, the sweet frivolity too, recall those of his diaphanous mother. The chapters describing their loves are among the best in the novel because Dickens manages to capture the painful ambivalence of David, both passionately infatuated with the irresistible young woman, to whom we can only pass and forgive everything, and frustrated by his weak character and his absolute ignorance of any discipline. For love, the supreme illusion of youth, he tries to change it, to &quot;form her mind&quot;, which leads him to recognize that &quot;firmness&quot; can to be a virtue which, ultimately, he needs. However, finding himself in a community of thought, even distantly, with his hateful and cruel stepfather whom he holds responsible for the death of his mother and a good deal of his own misfortunes, it was a troubling discovery.
It is his aunt Betsey who, by her character, represents the struggle to find the right balance between firmness and gentleness, rationality and empathy. Life forced Betsey Trotwood to assume the role she did not want, that of a father, and as such she became, but in her own way, adept at steadfastness and discipline. From an initially culpable intransigence, which led her to abandon the newborn by denouncing the incompetence of the parents not even capable of producing a girl, she finds herself gradually tempered by circumstances and powerfully helped by the &quot;madness&quot; of her protege, Mr Dick. He, between two flights of kites that carry away the fragments of his personal history, and without his knowing it, plays a moderating role, inflecting the rationality of his protector by his own irrationality, and his cookie-cutter judgments by considerations of seeming absurdity, but which, taken literally, prove to be innate wisdom. In truth, Aunt Betsey, despite her stiffness and bravado, does not dominate her destiny; she may say she can do it, yet she cannot get David to be a girl, or escape the machinations of Uriah Heep any more than the money demands of her mysterious husband. She also fails, in spite of her lucidity, her clear understanding, of the love blindness of her nephew, to prevent him from marrying Dora and in a parallel way, to reconcile the Strongs. In fact, in supreme irony, it is once again Mr Dick who compensates for his inadequacies, succeeding with intuition and instinctive understanding of things, to direct Mr Micawber to save Betsey from the clutches of Heep and also to dispel the misunderstandings of Dr Strong and his wife Annie.

As often in Dickens where a satellite of the main character reproduces the course in parallel, the story of the Strong couple develops in counterpoint that of David and Dora. While Dora is in agony, David, himself obsessed with his role as a husband, observes the Strongs who are busy unraveling their marital distress. Two statements made by Annie Strong impressed him: in the first, she told him why she rejected Jack Maldon and thanked her husband for saving her &quot;from the first impulse of an undisciplined heart&quot;. The second was like a flash of revelation: &quot;There can be no disparity in marriage like unsuitability of mind and purpose&quot;. At the end of chapter 45, almost entirely devoted to the epilogue of this affair, David meditates on these words which he repeats several times and whose relevance, applied to his own case, is imposed on him. He concludes that in all things, discipline tempered by kindness and kindness is necessary for the equilibrium of a successful life. Mr Murdstone preached firmness; in that, he was not wrong. Where he cruelly failed was that he matched it with selfish brutality instead of making it effective by the love of others.

==== The happiness of maturity with Agnes ====

It is because David has taken stock of his values and accepted the painful memories of Dora&#x27;s death, that he is finally ready to go beyond his emotional blindness and recognize his love for Agnes Wickfield, the one he already has called the &quot;true heroine&quot; of the novel to which he gives his name. Paul Davis writes that Agnes is surrounded by an aura of sanctity worthy of a stained glass window, that she is more a consciousness or an ideal than a person, that, certainly, she brings the loving discipline and responsibility of which the hero needs, but lacks the charm and human qualities that made Dora so attractive. Adrienne E Gavin, nuancing the point, writes that she is neither more nor less caricature than other young women in the hero&#x27;s life: if Emily is a stereotype of the &quot;lost woman&quot; and Dora of &quot;woman-child&quot;, Agnes is that of &quot;ideal Victorian woman&quot;, which necessarily limits, for her as for the others, the possibilities of evolution, the only change available from a loving and devoted daughter to a loving and devoted wife.

That said, the writer David, now David Copperfield, realised the vow expressed to Agnes (when he was newly in love with Dora, in Chapter 35. Depression): &quot;If I had a conjurer&#x27;s cap, there is no one I should have wished but for you&quot;. At the end of his story, he realises that the conjurer&#x27;s cap is on his head, that he can draw his attention to the people he loves and trusts. Thus, &quot;David Copperfield&quot; is the story of a journey through life and through oneself, but also, by the grace of the writer, the recreation of the tenuous thread uniting the child and the adult, the past and the present, in what Georges Gusdorf calls &quot;fidelity to the person&quot;. or, as Robert Ferrieux said, 

===Social questions===

Admittedly, it is not the primary interest of &quot;David Copperfield&quot; that remains above all the story of a life told by the very one who lived it, but the novel is imbued with a dominant ideology, that of the middle class, advocating moral constancy, hard work, separate spheres for men and women, and, in general, the art of knowing one&#x27;s place, indeed staying in that place. Further, some social problems and repeated abuses being topical, Dickens took the opportunity to expose them in his own way in his fiction, and Trevor Blount, in his introduction to the 1966 edition Penguin Classics, reissued in 1985, devotes several pages to this topic.

However, Gareth Cordery shows that behind the display of Victorian values, often hides a watermarked discourse that tends to question, test, and even subvert them. There are therefore two possible readings, the one that remains on the surface and another that questions below this surface, the implicit questions.

Among the social issues that &quot;David Copperfield&quot; is concerned with, are prostitution, the prison system, education, as well as society&#x27;s treatment of the insane.

Dickens&#x27;s views on education are reflected in the contrast he makes between the harsh treatment that David receives at the hands of Creakle at Salem House and Dr Strong&#x27;s school where the methods used inculcate honour and self–reliance in its pupils.

Through the character of &quot;the amiable, innocent, and wise fool&quot; Mr Dick, Dickens&#x27;s &quot;advocacy in the humane treatment of the insane&quot; can be seen. Mr Dick&#x27;s brother

::didn&#x27;t like to have him visible about his house, and sent him away to some private asylum-place: though he had been left to his particular care by their deceased father, who thought him almost a natural. And a wise man he must have been to think so! Mad himself, no doubt.

So Betsy Trotwood, continuing Mr Dick&#x27;s story in Chapter 14, stepped in to suggest that Mr Dick should be given &quot;his little income, and come and live with&quot; her: &quot;I am ready to take care of him, and shall not ill-treat him as some people (besides the asylum-folks) have done.&quot;

====Victorian child exploitation====
The employment of young children in factories and mines under harsh conditions in the early Victorian era disturbed many. There was a series of Parliamentary enquiries into the working conditions of children, and these &quot;reports shocked writers Elizabeth Barrett Browning and Charles Dickens.&quot; Dickens describes children working in factories or other workplaces in several novels, notably in &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, and in &quot;David Copperfield&quot;. Young David works in a factory for a while after his mother dies and his stepfather showed no interest in him. Such depictions contributed to the call for legislative reform.

====Prison discipline====

Dickens satirises contemporary ideas about how prisoners should be treated in Chapter 61, &#x27;I am Shown Two Interesting Penitents&#x27;. In this chapter, published in November 1850, David along with Traddles is shown around a large well-built new prison, modelled on Pentonville prison (built in 1842), where a new, supposedly more humane, system of incarceration is in operation, under the management of David&#x27;s former headmaster Creakle. A believer in firmness, Dickens denounced comically the system of isolating prisoners in separate cells, the &quot;separate system&quot;, and giving them healthy and pleasant food. His satire appeals directly to the public, already warned by the long controversy over the prison discipline in the press. Mr Creakle is very proud of this new system, but his enthusiasm is immediately undermined by the reminder of his former ferocity as a school principal. In the prison David and Traddles encounter &#x27;model prisoners&#x27; 27 and 28, who they discover are Uriah Heep and Mr Littimer. Heep is seen reading a hymn book and Littimer also &quot;walked forth, reading a good book&quot;: both have managed to convince the naïve Creakle, and his fellow magistrates, that they have seen the error of their ways. Both are questioned about the quality of the food and Creakle promises improvements.

Dickens&#x27;s ideas in this chapter were in line with Carlyle, whose pamphlet, &quot;Model Prisons&quot;, also denounced Pentonville Prison, was published in the spring of 1850. Indeed, Dickens had published anonymously, a month after Carlyle&#x27;s pamphlet on the same subject, &quot;Pet Prisonners&quot;.

====Emigration to Australia====

Dickens&#x27;s exploration of the subject of emigration in the novel has been criticised, initially by John Forster and later by G. K. Chesterton. Chesterton accused Dickens of presenting emigration in an excessively optimistic light, arguing that Dickens believed that by sending a boatload of people overseas their &#x27;souls&#x27; can be changed, while ignoring the fact that poor people like Peggotty have seen their home stained or, like Emily, their honour tarnished. Micawber has been broken by the English social system, his journey to the antipodes is paid for by a paragon of the Victorian bourgeoisie, Betsey Trotwood and he is supposed to regain control of his destiny once he has arrived in Australia. Trevor Blount points out that the word &#x27;soul&#x27; has a different meaning for Dickens than Chesterton. Dickens cares about material and psychological happiness, and is convinced that physical well-being is a comfort for life&#x27;s wounds.

Dickens sent his characters to America in &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; and &quot;Martin Chuzzlewit&quot;, but he has the Peggotty and Micawber families emigrate to Australia. This approach was part of the official policy of the 1840s, focusing on Australia as a land of welcome. It was at this time necessary to stimulate interest in the new colony and propagandists arrived in England in particular John Dunmore Lang and Caroline Chisholm from Australia. Dickens was only following this movement and, in any case, had faith in family colonisation. Moreover, the idea that redemption could be achieved by such a new start in a person&#x27;s life was a preoccupation of the author, and he saw here subject matter to charm his readers.

From the point of view of the novel&#x27;s inner logic, in order for Copperfield to complete his psychological maturation and exist independently, Dickens must expel his surrogate fathers, including Peggotty and Micawber, and emigration is an easy way to remove them.

====Visions for society====
The episode in the prison, according to novelist Angus Wilson, is more than a piece of journalism; it represents Dickens&#x27;s vision of the society in which he lives. The same can be said of the episodes concerning prostitution and emigration, which illuminate the limits of Copperfield&#x27;s moral universe and Dickens&#x27;s own uncertainties. That everything is put in order in Australia, that Martha marries a man from the bush, that Emily, in the strong arms of Dan Peggotty, becomes a lady of good works, that Micawber, who had been congenitally insolvent, suddenly acquires the management skills and becomes prosperous in dispensing justice. All these conversions are somewhat &#x27;ironic&#x27;, and tend to undermine the hypothesis of &#x27;a Dickens believing in the miracle of the antipodes&#x27;, which Jane Rogers considers in her analysis of the &#x27;fallen woman&#x27; as a plot device to gain the sympathy of Dickens&#x27;s readers for Emily.

==== The middle-class ideology ====
John Forster, Dickens&#x27;s early biographer, praises the bourgeois or middle-class values and ideology found in &quot;David Copperfield&quot;. Like him the Victorian reading public shared Copperfield&#x27;s complacent views, expressed with the assurance of success that is his, at the end, as a recognized writer who is happy in marriage and safe from need.

Gateth Cordery takes a close look at class consciousness. According to him, Copperfield&#x27;s relationship with aristocrat Steerforth and the humble Uriah Heep is &quot;crucial&quot;. From the beginning, Copperfield ranks as and is considered by his friends among the good people. The Peggotty family, in Chapter 3, treat him with respect, &quot;as a visitor of distinction&quot;; even at Murdstone and Grinby, his behaviour and clothes earned him the title of &quot;the little gentleman&quot;. When he reached adulthood, he naturally enjoyed Steerforth&#x27;s disdain for Ham as a simple &quot;joke about the poor&quot;. So he is predisposed to succumb, by what he calls in chapter 7 an &quot;inborn power of attraction&quot;, to the charm instinctively lent to beautiful people, about which David said &quot;a kind of enchantment ... to which it was a natural weakness to yield.&quot; From start to finish, David remains fascinated by Steerforth, so he aspires inwardly to his social status.

In parallel there is a contempt of the upstart, Heep, hatred of the same nature as Copperfield&#x27;s senseless adoration for Steerforth, but inverted. That &quot;&#x27;umble&quot; Heep goes from a lowly clerk to an associate at Wickfield&#x27;s, to claiming to win the hand of Agnes, daughter of his boss, is intolerable to David, though it is very similar to his own efforts to go from shorthand clerk to literary fame, with Dora Spenlow, the daughter of his employer. Heep&#x27;s innuendo that Copperfield is no better than him feeds on the disdain in which he holds Heep as of right: &quot;Copperfield, you&#x27;ve always been an upstart&quot;, an honesty of speech, comments Cordery, of which Copperfield himself is incapable.

====Marriage====

Another concern of Dickens is the institution of marriage and in particular, the unenviable place occupied by women. Whether at the home of Wickfield, Strong, or under the Peggotty boat, women are vulnerable to predators or intruders like Uriah Heep, Jack Maldon, James Steerforth; Murdstone&#x27;s firmness prevails up to the death of two wives; with David and Dora complete incompetence reigns; and at the Micawber household, love and chaos go hand in hand; while Aunt Betsey is subjected to blackmail by her mysterious husband. Dickens, according to Gareth Cordery, clearly attacks the official status of marriage, which perpetuated an inequality between the sexes, an injustice that does not end with the separation of couples.

The mid-Victorian era saw a change in gender roles for men and women, in part forced by the factories and separation of work and home, which made stereotypes of the woman at home and the man working away from home. Values, like the imperative need for women to marry and to be that ideal described as The Angel in the House (manages the home without aid and is always calm) are &quot;interrogated, tested and even subverted&quot;, for example by having one mother-figure be the character Betsey Trotwood, who is not a mother. When seeming to describe a stereotypical image in particularly the female characters, the story &quot;does so in a way that reflects the fault-lines of the image.&quot;

Anne Brontë in &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot; (1848) explores this iniquity in the status of the character Helen Graham, separated from her alcoholic husband. Dickens&#x27;s understanding of the burden on women in marriage in this novel contrasts with his treatment of his own wife Catherine, whom he expected to be an Angel in the House.

====The fallen woman====

Martha Endell and Emily Peggotty, the two friends in Yarmouth who work at the undertaker&#x27;s house, reflect Dickens&#x27;s commitment to &quot;save&quot; so-called fallen women. Dickens was co-founder with Angela Burdett-Coutts of Urania Cottage, a home for young women who had &quot;turned to a life of immorality&quot;, including theft and prostitution. On the eve of her wedding to her cousin and fiancé, Ham, Emily abandons him for Steerforth. After Steerforth deserts her, she doesn&#x27;t go back home, because she has disgraced herself and her family. Her uncle, Mr Peggotty, finds her in London on the brink of being forced into prostitution. So that she may have a fresh start away from her now degraded reputation, she and her uncle emigrate to Australia. Martha has been a prostitute and contemplated suicide but towards the end of the novel, she redeems herself by helping Daniel Peggotty find his niece after she returns to London. She goes with Emily to start a new life in Australia. There, she marries and lives happily.

Their emigration to Australia, in the wake of that of Micawber, Daniel Peggotty, and Mr Mell, emphasizes Dickens&#x27;s belief that social and moral redemption can be achieved in a distant place, where someone may create a new and healthy life. However, despite their families&#x27; forgiveness, they remain &quot;tainted&quot; and their expulsion from England is symbolic of their status: it is only at the other end of the world that these &quot;social outcasts&quot; can be reinstated. Morally, Dickens here conforms to the dominant middle-class opinion.

====The exception of Rosa Dartle====
John O. Jordan devotes two pages to this woman, also &quot;lost&quot;, though never having sinned. The sanctification of the Victorian home, he says, depends on the opposition between two stereotypes, the &quot;angel&quot; and the &quot;whore&quot;. Dickens denounced this restrictive dichotomy by portraying women &quot;in between&quot;. Such is Rosa Dartle, passionate being, with the inextinguishable resentment of having been betrayed by Steerforth, a wound that is symbolised by the vibrant scar on her lip. Never does she allow herself to be assimilated by the dominant morality, refusing tooth and nail to put on the habit of the ideal woman. Avenger to the end, she wants the death of Little Emily, both the new conquest and victim of the same predator, and has only contempt for the efforts of David to minimize the scope of his words. As virtuous as anyone else, she claims, especially that Emily, she does not recognize any ideal family, each being moulded in the manner of its social class, nor any affiliation as a woman: she is Rosa Dartle, in herself.

David&#x27;s vision, on the other hand, is marked by class consciousness: for him, Rosa, emaciated and ardent at the same time, as if there were incompatibility (chapter 20), is a being apart, half human, half animal, like the lynx, with its inquisitive forehead, always on the look out (chapter 29), which consumes an inner fire reflected in the gaunt eyes of the dead of which only this flame remains (chapter 20). In reality, says Jordan, it is impossible for David to understand or even imagine any sexual tension, especially that which governs the relationship between Rosa and Steerforth, which, in a way, reassures his own innocence and protects what he calls his &quot;candour&quot; – frankness or angelism? – his story. Also, Rosa Dartle&#x27;s irreducible and angry marginality represents a mysterious threat to his comfortable and reassuring domestic ideology.

==Dickens&#x27;s way of writing==

Dickens&#x27;s approach to the novel is influenced by various literary genres, including the picaresque novel tradition, melodrama, and the novel of sensibility. Satire and irony are central to the picaresque novel. Comedy is also an aspect of the British picaresque novel tradition of Laurence Sterne, Henry Fielding, and Tobias Smollett. Fielding&#x27;s &quot;Tom Jones&quot; was a major influence on the nineteenth century novel including Dickens, who read it in his youth, and named a son Henry Fielding Dickens in his honour. Melodrama is typically sensational and designed to appeal strongly to the emotions.

Trevor Blount comments on the fascination that Dickens has always exercised on the public. He mentions the lavishness, energy, vividness, brilliance, and tenderness of Dickens&#x27;s writing, along with the range of his imagination. Blount also refers to Dickens&#x27;s humour, and his use of the macabre and of pathos. Finally, Blount celebrates the artistic mastery of an overflowing spontaneity, which is conveyed with both delicacy and subtlety. What Blount admires, in the first place, is the vigour with which the characters &quot;rise&quot; from the page and create a &quot;phantasmagorical&quot; universe, which is seen by the reader with the intensity of an hallucination. This is best illustrated in many of Dickens&#x27;s works, by the powerful figure of a weak individual. In &quot;David Copperfield&quot; Mr Wilkins Micawber is such a figure, someone who is formidably incompetent, grandiose in his irreducible optimism, sumptuous in his verbal virtuosity, and whose grandiloquent tenderness is irresistibly comical. Micawber has been described as &quot;With the one exception of Falstaff, ... the greatest comic figure in English literature&quot;.

In this novel, one characteristic noted by Edgar Johnson is that Dickens, in the first part, &quot;makes the reader see with the eyes of a child&quot;, an innovative technique for the time, first tried in &quot;Dombey and Son&quot; with an omniscient narrator, and carried here to perfection through the use of the &#x27;I&#x27;.

Modernist novelist Virginia Woolf writes, that when we read Dickens &quot;we remodel our psychological geography ... [as he produces] characters who exist not in detail, not accurately or exactly, but abundantly in a cluster of wild yet extraordinarily revealing remarks&quot;.

===Satire and pathos===
The very principle of satire is to question, and to tear off the masks, so as to reveal the raw reality under the varnish. Dickens uses the whole arsenal of literary tools that are available to the satirist, or rather supplied by his narrator, David, who even directs satire upon himself. These tools include irony, humour, and caricature. How it is employed relates to the characters&#x27; differing personalities. Satire is thus gentler towards some characters than others; toward David the hero-narrator, it is at once indulgent and transparent.

====Types of character====

There are several different types of character: On the one hand, there are the good ones, Peggotty, Dr Strong, Traddles, Agnes etc., on the other hand, there are the bad ones, Murdstone, Steerforth, Uriah Heep, etc. A third category are characters who change over time, including Betsey Trotwood, who at first is more obstinate than nasty, it is true, and Martha Endell, and Creakle, etc. There is also a contrast drawn between ever-frozen personalities such as Micawber, Dora, Rosa Dartle, and those who evolve. The latter includes David, Mr Mell, Miss Mowcher. There is also a contrast drawn between the idiosyncrasies of Mr Dick, Barkis, Mrs Gummidge, and the subtle metamorphosis from innocence to maturity of characters like David, Traddles, Agnes.

Dickens worked intensively on developing arresting names for his characters that would reverberate with associations for his readers, and assist the development of motifs in the storyline, giving what one critic calls an &quot;allegorical impetus&quot; to a novel&#x27;s meanings. The name Mr Murdstone in &quot;David Copperfield&quot; conjures up twin allusions to &quot;murder&quot; and stony coldness; Strong is definitely not &quot;strong&quot;; Creakle &quot;squeaks and grinds&quot;. There can also be a visual dimension to Dickens&#x27;s humour. This includes Micawber&#x27;s rotundity, his wife&#x27;s dried-up body, which forever offers a sterile breast, Betsey&#x27;s steadfast stiffness, Mr Sharp&#x27;s bowed head, Daniel Peggotty&#x27;s stubborn rudeness, Clara Copperfield&#x27;s delicate silhouette, and Dora&#x27;s mischievous air. Then there are exaggerated attitudes that are constantly repeated. Dickens creates humour out of character traits, such as Mr Dick&#x27;s kite flying, James Steerforth&#x27;s insistent charm, Uriah Heep&#x27;s obsequiousness, Betsey pounding David&#x27;s room. There are in addition the employment of repetitive verbal phrases: &quot;umble&quot; of the same Heep, the &quot;willin&quot; of Barkis, the &quot;lone lorn creetur&quot; of Mrs Gummidge. Dickens also uses objects for a humorous purpose, like Traddles&#x27;s skeletons, the secret box of Barkis, the image of Heep as a snake, and the metallic rigidity of Murdstone.

====Pathos and indulgent humour====

In &quot;David Copperfield&quot; idealised characters and highly sentimental scenes are contrasted with caricatures and ugly social truths. While good characters are also satirised, a considered sentimentality replaces satirical ferocity. This is a characteristic of all of Dickens&#x27;s writing, but it is reinforced in &quot;David Copperfield&quot; by the fact that these people are the narrator&#x27;s close family members and friends, who are devoted to David and sacrificing themselves for his happiness. Hence the indulgence applied from the outset, with humour prevailing along with loving complicity. David is the first to receive such treatment, especially in the section devoted to his early childhood, when he is lost in the depths of loneliness in London, following his punishment by Mr Murdstone. Michael Hollington analyses a scene in chapter 11 that seems emblematic of the situation and how humour and sentimentality are employed by Dickens. This is the episode where the very young David orders a pitcher of the best beer in a public house, &quot;To moisten what I had for dinner&quot;. David&#x27;s memory has retained the image of the scene, which is so vivid that he sees himself as from the outside. He has forgotten the exact date (his birthday). This episode release David&#x27;s emotional pain, writes Michael Hollington, obliterating the infected part of the wound. Beyond the admiration aroused for the amazing self-confidence of the little child, in resolving this issue and taking control of his life with the assurance of someone much older, the passage &quot;testifies to the work of memory, transfiguring the moment into a true myth&quot;. The tone is nostalgic because, ultimately, the epilogue is a true moment of grace. The wife of the keeper, returning David&#x27;s money, deposits on his forehead a gift that has become extremely rare, a kiss, &quot;Half admired and half compassionate&quot;, but above all full of kindness and femininity; at least, adds David, as a tender and precious reminder, &quot;I am sure&quot;.

===Theatricality===
Dickens went to the theatre regularly from an early age and even considered becoming an actor in 1832. &quot;Many of the plays that he saw on the London stage in the 1820s and 1830s were melodramas&quot;. There is a visual, theatrical—even cinematic—element in some scenes in &quot;David Copperfield&quot;. The cry of Martha at the edge of the river belongs to the purest Victorian melodrama, as does the confrontation between Mr Peggotty and Mrs Steerforth, in chapter 32:

::I justify nothing, I make no counter-accusations. But I am sorry to repeat, it is impossible. Such a marriage would irretrievably blight my son&#x27;s career, and ruin his prospects. Nothing is more certain than that, it never can take place, and never will. If there is any other compensation.

Such language, according to Trevor Blount, is meant to be said aloud. Many other scenes employ the same method: Micawber crossing the threshold, Heep harassing David in Chapter 17, the chilling apparition of Littimer in the middle of David&#x27;s party in Chapter 27. The climax of this splendid series of scenes is the storm off Yarmouth, which is an epilogue to the menacing references to the sea previously, which shows Dicken&#x27;s most intense virtuosity (chapter 55).

Dickens made the following comment in 1858: &quot;Every good actor plays direct to every good author, and every writer of fiction, though he may not adopt the dramatic form, writes in effect for the stage&quot;.

===Setting===
Setting is a major aspect of Dickens&#x27;s &quot;narrative artistry and of his methods of characterization&quot;, so that &quot;the most memorable quality of his novels may well be their atmospheric density [... of the] descriptive writing&quot;.

In &quot;David Copperfield&quot; setting is less urban, more rustic than in other novels, and especially maritime. Besides Peggotty, who is a seaman whose home is an overturned hull, Mr Micawber goes to the naval port of Plymouth on the south coast after prison and appears finally on board a steamer. David himself is connected to Yarmouth, and Aunt Betsey settled in the Channel port of Dover. Young David notices the sea on his first day at her home; &quot;the air from the sea came blowing in again, mixed with the perfume of the flowers&quot;. The city, London, is especially the place of misfortune, where the dark warehouse of Murdstone and Grinby are found. The philosopher Alain (pseudonym of Émile-Auguste Chartier) comments as follows about Dickens&#x27;s portrayal of London (but it might also be applied to other locations), as cited by Lançon:

::The Dickensian atmosphere, unlike any other, comes from the way the distinctive nature of a dwelling is linked to the personality of its inhabitant [...] [There is there] a look that creates a sense of reality, with the remarkable connection between buildings and characters.

===Symbolism===
Important symbols include, imprisonment, the sea, flowers, animals, dreams, and Mr Dick&#x27;s kite. According to Henri Suhamy, &quot;Dickens&#x27;s symbolism consists in giving significance to physical details ... The constant repetition of these details ... contributes to deepen their emblematic significance&quot;. This may include the characters, aspects of the story, and, more prominently amongst the motifs, places or objects.

Separating realism and symbolism can be tricky, especially, for example, when it relates, to the subject of imprisonment, which is both a very real place of confinement for the Micawber family, and, more generally throughout &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, symbolic of the damage inflicted on a sick society, trapped in its inability to adapt or compromise, with many individuals walled within in themselves.

The imponderable power of the sea is almost always associated with death: it took Emily&#x27;s father; will take Ham and Steerforth, and in general is tied to David&#x27;s &quot;unrest&quot; associated with his Yarmouth experiences. In the end nothing remains but Steerforth&#x27;s body cast-up as &quot;flotsam and jetsam&quot;, that symbolises the moral emptiness of David&#x27;s adoration. The violent storm in Yarmouth coincides with the moment when the conflicts reached a critical threshold, when it is as if angry Nature called for a final resolution; as Kearney noted, &quot;The rest of the novel is something of an anti-climax after the storm chapter.&quot; Referring to the climactic storm scene in &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, the last in any Dickens novel, Kearney remarked that &quot;The symbolism of sea, sky and storm is successfully integrated to achieve what amounts to a mystical dimension in the novel, and this mystical dimension is, on the whole, more acceptable than the ones found elsewhere in Dickens&quot;.

According to Daniel L Plung, four types of animal are a particularly important aspect of the way symbolism is used: song birds symbolise innocence; &quot;lions and raptors [are] associated with the fallen but not evil&quot;; dogs, other than Jip, are associated &quot;with the malicious and self-interested&quot;; while snakes and eel represent evil. A typical example of the way that animal symbolism is used is found in the following sentence: &quot; &#x27;the influence of the Murdstones upon me [David] was like the fascination of two snakes on a wretched young bird&quot; &#x27;. When David describes Steerforth as &quot;brave as a lion&quot; this is a clue to Steerforth&#x27;s moral weakness and foreshadows subsequent events.

Flowers symbolise innocence, for example, David is called &quot;Daisy&quot; by Steerforth, because he is naive and pure, while Dora constantly paints bouquets, and when Heep was removed from Wickfield House, flowers return to the living room. Mr Dick&#x27;s kite, represents how much he is both outside and above society, immune to its hierarchical social system. Furthermore, it flies among the innocent birds, and just as this toy soothes and gives joy to him, Mr Dick heals the wounds and restore peace where the others without exception have failed.

Dreams are also an important part of the novel&#x27;s underlying symbolic structure, and are &quot;used as a transitional device to bind [its] parts together&quot; with twelve chapters ending &quot;with a dream or reverie&quot;. In the early dark period of David&#x27;s life his dreams &quot;are invariably ugly&quot;, but in later chapters they are more mixed, with some reflecting &quot;fanciful hopes&quot; that are never realised, while others are nightmares which foreshadow &quot;actual problems&quot;.

In addition physical beauty, in the form of Clara, is emblematic of moral good, while the ugliness of Uriah Heep, Mr Creakle and Mr Murdstone underlines their villainy. While David, the story&#x27;s hero, has benefited from her love and suffered from the violence of the others.

=== Dialect ===
Dickens, in preparation for this novel, went to Norwich, Lowestoft, and Yarmouth where the Peggotty family resides, but he stayed there for only five hours, on 9 January 1849. He assured his friends, that his descriptions were based on his own memories, brief as were his local experiences. However, looking to the work of K. J. Fielding reveals that the dialect of this town was taken from a book written by a local author, Major Edward Moor published in 1823. There, Dickens found &quot;a beein&quot; (a house), &quot;fisherate&quot; (officiate), &quot;dodman&quot; (snail), &quot;clickesen&quot; (gossip), and &quot;winnicking&quot; (tears) from &quot;winnick&quot; (to cry) and so on.

==Literary significance and reception==

Many view this novel as Dickens&#x27;s masterpiece, beginning with his friend and first biographer John Forster, who writes: &quot;Dickens never stood so high in reputation as at the completion of Copperfield&quot;, and the author himself calls it &quot;his favourite child&quot;. It is true, he says, that &quot;underneath the fiction lay something of the author&#x27;s life&quot;, that is, an experience of self-writing. It is therefore not surprising that the book is often placed in the category of autobiographical works. From a strictly literary point of view, however, it goes beyond this framework in the richness of its themes and the originality of its writing.

Situated in the middle of Dickens&#x27;s career, it represents, according to Paul Davis, a turning point in his work, the point of separation between the novels of youth and those of maturity. In 1850, Dickens was 38 years old and had twenty more to live, which he filled with other masterpieces, often denser, sometimes darker, that addressed most of the political, social and personal issues he faced.

===&quot;The privileged child&quot; of Dickens===
Dickens welcomed the publication of his work with intense emotion, and he continued to experience this until the end of his life. When he went through a period of personal difficulty and frustration in the 1850s, he returned to &quot;David Copperfield&quot; as to a dear friend who resembled him: &quot;Why,&quot; he wrote to Forster, &quot;Why is it, as with poor David, a sense comes always crashing on me now, when I fall into low spirits, as of one happiness I have missed in life, and one friend and companion I have never made?&quot; When Dickens begins writing &quot;Great Expectations&quot;, which was also written in the first person, he reread &quot;David Copperfield&quot; and confided his feelings to Forster: &quot;was affected by it to a degree you would hardly believe&quot;. Criticism has not always been even-handed, though over time the high importance of this novel has been recognised.

===Initial reception===
Although Dickens became a Victorian celebrity his readership was mainly the middle classes, including the so-called skilled workers, according to the French critic Fabrice Bensimon, because ordinary people could not afford it. Issues I to V of the serial version reached 25,000 copies in two years, modest sales compared to 32,000 &quot;Dombey and Son&quot; and 35,000 &quot;Bleak House&quot;, but Dickens was nevertheless happy: &quot;Everyone is cheering David on&quot;, he writes to Mrs Watson, and, according to Forster, his reputation was at the top.

The first reviews were mixed, but the great contemporaries of Dickens showed their approval: Thackeray found the novel &quot;freshly and simply simple&quot;; John Ruskin, in his &quot;Modern Painters&quot;, was of the opinion that the scene of the storm surpasses Turner&#x27;s evocations of the sea; more soberly, Matthew Arnold declared it &quot;rich in merits&quot;; and, in his autobiographical book &quot;A Small Boy and Others&quot;, Henry James evokes the memory of &quot;treasure so hoarded in the dusty chamber of youth&quot;.

===Subsequent reputation===
After Dickens&#x27;s death, &quot;David Copperfield&quot; rose to the forefront of the writer&#x27;s works, both through sales, for example, in &quot;Household Words&quot; in 1872 where sales reached 83,000, and the praise of critics. In 1871, Scottish novelist and poet Margaret Oliphant described it as &quot;the culmination of Dickens&#x27;s early comic fiction&quot;; However, in the late nineteenth-century Dickens&#x27;s critical reputation suffered a decline, though he continued to have many readers. This began when Henry James in 1865 &quot;relegated Dickens to the second division of literature on the grounds that he could not &#x27;see beneath the surface of things&#x27;&quot;. Then in 1872, two years after Dickens&#x27;s death, George Henry Lewes wondered how to &quot;reconcile [Dickens&#x27;s] immense popularity with the &#x27;critical contempt&#x27; which he attracted&quot;. However, Dickens was defended by the novelist George Gissing in 1898 in &quot;Charles Dickens: A Critical Study&quot;. G. K. Chesterton published an important defence of Dickens in his book &quot;Charles Dickens&quot; in 1906, where he describes him as this &quot;most English of our great writers&quot;. Dickens&#x27;s literary reputation grew in the 1940s and 1950s because of essays by George Orwell and Edmund Wilson (both published in 1940), and Humphrey House&#x27;s &quot;The Dickens World&quot; (1941). However, in 1948, F. R. Leavis in &quot;The Great Tradition&quot;, contentiously, excluded Dickens from his canon, characterising him as a &quot;popular entertainer&quot; without &quot;mature standards and interests&quot;.
Dickens&#x27;s reputation, however, continued to grow and K. J. Fielding (1965) and Geoffrey Thurley (1976) identify what they call &quot;David Copperfield&quot;&#x27;s &quot;centrality&quot;, and Q. D. Leavis in 1970, looked at the images he draws of marriage, of women, and of moral simplicity. In their 1970 publication &quot;Dickens the Novelist&quot;, F. R. and Q. D. Leavis called Dickens &quot;one of the greatest of creative writers&quot;, and F. R. Leavis had changed his mind about Dickens since his 1948 work, no longer finding the popularity of the novels with readers as a barrier to their seriousness or profundity. In 1968 Sylvère Monod, after having finely analyzed the structure and style of the novel, describe it as &quot;the triumph of the art of Dickens&quot;, which analysis was shared by Paul B. Davis. The central themes are explored by Richard Dunne in 1981, including the autobiographical dimension, the narrator-hero characterization process, memory and forgetting, and finally the privileged status of the novel in the interconnection between similar works of Dickens. Q. D. Leavis compares &quot;Copperfield&quot; to Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;War and Peace&quot; and looks at adult-child relationships in both novels. According to writer Paul B. Davis, Q. D. Leavis excels at dissecting David&#x27;s relationship with Dora. Gwendolyn Needham in an essay, published in 1954, analyzes the novel as a bildungsroman, as did Jerome H. Buckley twenty years later. In 1987 Alexander Welsh devoted several chapters to show that &quot;Copperfield&quot; is the culmination of Dickens&#x27;s autobiographical attempts to explore himself as a novelist in the middle of his career. Finally, J. B. Priestley was particularly interested in Mr Micawber and concludes that &quot;With the one exception of Falstaff, he is the greatest comic figure in English literature&quot;.

In 2015, the BBC Culture section polled book critics outside the UK about novels by British authors; they ranked &quot;David Copperfield&quot; eighth on the list of the 100 Greatest British Novels. The characters and their varied places in society in the novel evoked reviewer comments, for example, the novel is &quot;populated by some of the most vivid characters ever created,&quot; &quot;David himself, Steerforth, Peggotty, Mr Dick – and it climbs up and down and off the class ladder.&quot;, remarked by critic Maureen Corrigan and echoed by Wendy Lesser.

===Opinions of other writers===
&quot;David Copperfield&quot; has pleased many writers. Charlotte Brontë, for example, commented in 1849 in a letter to the reader of her publisher: &quot;I have read &quot;David Copperfield&quot;; it seems to me very good—admirable in some parts. You said it had affinity to &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;: it has—now and then—only what an advantage has Dickens in his varied knowledge of men and things!&quot; Tolstoy, for his part, considered it &quot;the best work of the best English novelist&quot; and, according to F. R. Leavis and Q. D. Leavis, was inspired by David and Dora&#x27;s love story to have Prince Andrew marry Princess Lise in &quot;War and Peace&quot;. Henry James remembered being moved to tears, while listening to the novel, hidden under a table, read aloud in the family circle. Dostoevsky enthusiastically cultivated the novel in a prison camp in Siberia. Franz Kafka wrote in his diary in 1917, that the first chapter of his novel &quot;Amerika&quot; was inspired by &quot;David Copperfield&quot;. James Joyce parodied it in &quot;Ulysses&quot;. Virginia Woolf, who was not very fond of Dickens, states that &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, along with &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, Grimm&#x27;s fairy tales, Scott&#x27;s &quot;Waverley&quot; and &quot;Pickwick&#x27;s Posthumous Papers&quot;, &quot;are not books, but stories communicated by word of mouth in those tender years when fact and fiction merge, and thus belong to the memories and myths of life, and not to its aesthetic experience.&quot; Woolf also noted in a letter to Hugh Walpole in 1936, that she is re-reading it for the sixth time: &quot;I&#x27;d forgotten how magnificent it is.&quot; It also seems that the novel was Sigmund Freud&#x27;s favourite; and Somerset Maugham sees it as a &quot;great&quot; work, although his hero seems to him rather weak, unworthy even of its author, while Mr Micawber never disappoints: &quot;The most remarkable of them is, of course, Mr Micawber. He never fails you.&quot;

==Illustrations ==
As is the custom for a regular serialised publication for a wide audience, &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, like Dickens&#x27;s earlier novels, was from the beginning a &quot;story in pictures&quot; whose many engravings are part of the novel and how the story is related.

=== Hablot Knight Browne (Phiz) ===
Phiz drew the original, the first two illustrations associated with &quot;David Copperfield&quot;: on the wrapper for the serial publication, for which he engraved the silhouette of a baby staring at a globe, probably referring to the working title (&quot;The Copperfield Survey of the World as it Rolled&quot;), and the frontispiece (later used in the published books), and the title page. The green wrapper is shown at the top of this article. Phiz drew the images around the central baby-over-the-globe with no information on the characters who would appear in the novel. He knew only that it would be a bildungsroman. The images begin at the bottom, on the left side of the tree that has leaves on the left, and is dead on the right. A woman holds a baby on her lap. The images continue clockwise, marking events of a life, but with no reference to any specific event or specific character of the novel.

When each issue was written, Phiz then worked with Dickens on the illustrations. &quot;In the monthly plates, Phiz would have to translate the memories of the protagonist-narrator into a third-person objective or dramatic point of view.&quot; Some of his illustrations contain details that are not in the text, but illuminate a character or situation, &quot;forming part of [...] of what the novel is&quot;. Dickens accepted and even encouraged these additional, sometimes subtle indications, which, commenting on the event, say more than the narrator says in print. The latter intends to stay behind, just like the author who, thus, hides behind the illustrator.

Dickens was particularly scrupulous about illustrations; he scrutinised the smallest details and sometimes demanded modifications, for example to replace for a very particular episode the coat that David wears by &quot;a little jacket&quot;. The illustration of the meeting between David and Aunt Betsey was particularly delicate, and Phiz had to do it several times, the ultimate choice being that of Dickens. Once the desired result was obtained, Dickens does not hide his satisfaction: the illustrations are &quot;capital&quot;, he writes to Phiz, and especially that which depicts Mr Micawber in chapter 16, &quot;uncommonly characteristic&quot;.

One puzzling mismatch between the text and accompanying illustrations is that of the Peggotty family&#x27;s boat-house &quot;cottage&quot; on the Yarmouth sands (pictured). It is clear from the text that the author envisaged the house as an upright boat, whereas the illustrator depicted it as an upturned hull resting on the beach with holes cut for the doors and windows. Interior illustrations of the cottage also show it as a room with curved ceiling beams implying an upturned hull. Although Dickens seemed to have had the opportunity to correct this discrepancy he never did, suggesting that he was happy with the illustrator&#x27;s depiction.

=== Other illustrators ===


&quot;David Copperfield&quot; was later illustrated by many artists later, after the serialization, including:
* Fred Barnard (1846–1896), who illustrated &quot;David Copperfield&quot; in the Household Edition by Chapman &amp; Hall in the 1870s;
* Kyd (Joseph Clayton Clarke) (1855–1937);
* Harold Copping (1863–1932), who illustrated Dickens stories for children;
* Frank Reynolds (1876–1953);
* Jessica Willcox Smith (1863–1935) who has illustrated many abbreviated editions for children.
* Charles Keeping (1924–1988) who illustrated the complete works of Dickens for the Folio Society.

Some of these works are fullsize paintings rather than illustrations included in editions of the novels. Kyd painted watercolours. Frank Reynolds provided the illustrations for a 1911 edition of David Copperfield.

Although the reputation of Dickens with literary critics went through a decline and a much later rise after he died, his popularity with readers followed a different pattern after his death. Around 1900, his novels, including &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, began an increase in popularity, and the 40-year copyrights expired for all but his latest novels, opening the door to other publishers in the UK; by 1910 all of them had expired. This created the opportunity for new illustrators in new editions of the novels, as both Fred Barnard (Household Edition) and Frank Reynolds (1911 edition of &quot;David Copperfield&quot;) provided, for example; their styles were different from that of Phiz who provided the illustrations for the first publications of the novel in 1850 and during the author&#x27;s life. As the books were read by so many (one publisher, Chapman &amp; Hall, sold 2 million copies of Dickens&#x27;s works in the period 1900–1906), the characters became more popular for use outside the novels, in jigsaw puzzles and postcards. Uriah Heep and Mr Micawber were popular figures for illustrations. As World War I approached, the illustrations on postcards and the novels, abridged or full length, continued in popularity in the UK and among the soldiers and sailors abroad.
==Major print editions of &quot;David Copperfield&quot;==
===Publishing contract===
Like &quot;Dombey and Son&quot;, &quot;David Copperfield&quot; was not the subject of a specific contract; it followed the agreement of 1 June 1844, which was still valid. In that contract, the publishing house Bradbury and Evans received a quarter of the receipts from what Dickens wrote for the next eight years. This did not prevent the novelist from criticizing his publisher, or providing an incomplete number, just &quot;to see exactly where I am&quot; and for his illustrator Phiz to have &quot;some material to work on&quot;.

===Dedication and preface===
The 1850 book, published by Bradbury and Evans, was dedicated to the honourable Mr and Mrs Richard Watson, from Rockingham, Northamptonshire, aristocratic friends met on a trip to Switzerland five years ago. A brief preface was written in 1850 by the author, already entrusted to Forster after he finished his manuscript, with the promise that a new work will follow. This text was also used for the 1859 edition, the Cheap Edition. The ultimate version of 1867, also called the Charles Dickens edition, included another preface by the author with the statement that &quot;David Copperfield&quot; is the favourite work of the author.

===Other editions===
Three volumes were published by Tauchnitz in 1849–50, in English, for distribution outside Great Britain in Europe. During Dickens&#x27;s lifetime, many other editions were released, and many since he died. According to Paul Schlicke, the most reliable edition is the 1981 edition from Clarendon Press with an introduction and notes by Nina Burgis; it serves as a reference for later editions, including those of Collins, Penguin Books and Wordsworth Classics.

==Adaptations==

===Earliest adaptations===
While it was being published, &quot;David Copperfield&quot; was the object, according to Philip Bolton&#x27;s survey, of six initial dramatisations, followed by a further twenty when the public&#x27;s interest was at its peak in the 1850s. The first adaptation, &quot;Born with a Caul&quot; by George Almar, was staged while the serial issues were not yet completed, with some changes from Dickens&#x27;s plot, having Steerforth live and marry Emily, and inventing a character to kill Mr Murdstone. The most spectacular dramatisation, however, were those of Dickens himself. Although he waited more than ten years to prepare a version for his public readings, it soon became one of his favourite performances, especially the storm scene, which he kept for the finale, &quot;the most sublime moment in all the readings&quot;.

===Fiction===

<text>Kourou (; ) is a commune in French Guiana, an overseas region and department of France in South America. Kourou is famous for being the location of the Guiana Space Centre, the main spaceport of France and the European Space Agency (ESA). It is an administrative district in French Guiana and the main town there.

==Geography==
Some northwest of the French Guianese capital Cayenne the Kourou River empties into the Atlantic Ocean. At the mouth of this river sits the town of Kourou, which is ringed by four hills: Carapa, Pariacabo, Café and Lombard, with the Singes and Condamine mountains not far behind. There are three lakes within the town&#x27;s city limits: Lake Bois Diable (where one can take lessons in jetski and other aquatic sports), Lake Marie-Claire (the smallest and calmest), and Lake Bois Chaudat (the biggest of the three; also open to sport lovers, especially canoers and kayakers). Long white sand beaches and some rocky outcrops line the town&#x27;s ocean coast, the riverbank and all points inland consisting mostly of mangrove and dense tropical rainforest.

The town had a population of 24,805 inhabitants at the 2020 census. Its inhabitants can be classified into three ethnic groups of roughly equal size:
*Indigenous peoples (mostly Kalina - also called Galibi), Creoles, Maroons (Boni and Saramaka),
*Whites (mostly French, from Metropolitan France), and
*Foreigners (Brazilians, Surinamese, Hmong, Haitians, Guyanese, etc.)

The Saramaka mostly settled in the &quot;quartier Saramaka&quot;, along the river. In 2006, a fire rendered 55 people homeless.

Guiana in general has a high level of crime compared to the rest of France&#x27;s &quot;départements&quot;; Kourou has an average of two armed robberies a day. A march protesting the high level of insecurity felt by most of the population was held in Kourou on 27 October 2006. Shopkeepers of Chinese descent in particular are often targeted by armed robbers, their cash registers emptied and some products stolen.

Kourou is the port of departure for those going to the Iles du Salut, of which the most famous is Devil&#x27;s Island. It is also common for many to go up the river in canoes on weekends to camp in the forest.

The Guiana Space Centre, where the European Space Agency starts missions, is located a little behind and outside the town. Part of the town and the islands are closed during rocket launches.

In 2010, the Kourou solar power plant was built near Kourou on Aubanèle Savannah. It is the largest solar power plant in Overseas France.

==History==

===Era of Kalini people===
Not much is known of the pre-colonial era. The area was mostly populated by Kalina, or Galibi before the arrival of the French in the late 17th century.

Not far from the town at Les Roches Gravées (The Carved Rocks), indigenous art can be seen on the rock walls.

===Early colonization===
Vicente Yáñez Pinzón sailed along most of the north coast of South America and passed by the current location of Kourou in 1500.

The Jesuits Lombard and Creuilly baptised a few Galibis at the church of Saint Nicholas in Cayenne in December 1710 and returned with them soon after to farm the land at Guatémala, across the river from Kourou. The Society of Jesus was disbanded (in Guiana) in 1762, however, and Kourou was nothing more than a small village until the arrival of the Expedition.

In 1744, La Condamine, in charge of the expedition sent to Peru in 1735 to determine the length of a degree of the meridian arc in the neighbourhood of the equator, passed by and gave his name to one of the mountains behind Kourou.

===Expedition===
The mission at Kourou being abandoned by the Jesuits, the engineers Mentelle and Tugny designed the layout of the future town. This resulted in the neighbourhood called the Bourg, around the Church of Saint Catherine and next to the port on the river.

That same year, 1763, as agreed in the Treaty of Paris, Great Britain took control of New France. Having lost their largest and richest colony, the French decided to send a large expedition to Guiana, commanded by Choiseul. Around 10,000 to 12,000 people, mostly Frenchmen, tempted by stories of an El Dorado on the other side of the ocean, settled in Kourou.

The small town, surrounded by marshes and rainforest, was unprepared for such a massive influx of people, and around 6,000 of the pioneers died within the year due to fevers and other illnesses. Those remaining fled to the îles du Salut, free of mosquitoes due to constant winds, to recover before being repatriated to Metropolitan France. Hence the name, &quot;Salvation Islands.&quot; Previously they had been known as the &quot;îles du Diable&quot; (&quot;Devil&#x27;s Islands&quot;), and one of the islands retains the name to this day.

The failure of the Expedition only served to discourage settling in Guiana. The colony earned the nickname &quot;Enfer Vert&quot; (&quot;Green Hell&quot;), which it is still trying to shake. No other project of mass colonisation was undertaken, and the population of Whites was always drastically lower than that of the slaves. The population of the colony, of all races, did not rise above 20,000 until the gold rush (starting in 1855), the second abolition of slavery in 1848 and the founding of the prisons.

===Prisons===

Kourou was formerly the home of the &quot;Kourou Prison&quot; which was one of the main prisons in French Guiana, and which was also a part of the notorious Devil&#x27;s Island Prison System. The Kourou Prison was dedicated mostly to agriculture.

In 1852 the three main islands off of Kourou&#x27;s coast, the Salut island group (which included Devil&#x27;s Island) also became prisons. These island prisons held mostly political prisoners, as well as some of France&#x27;s toughest criminals. The first prisoners arrived in 1862.

In 1938, a law was passed prohibiting the transport of any new prisoners from France to French Guiana. In 1946 eight years later, the Kourou Prison was finally shut down, while some prisoners were kept in other Guyanese prisons until as late as 1953.

After the closing of the prison, most of the prison buildings were demolished to make room for the &quot;Hôtel des Roches&quot;, but some vestiges of that period remain. One notable remnant of the prison is the Dreyfus Tower, which stands where the river meets the ocean. This tower was used in pre-radio days to communicate with the islands via Semaphore. Other prison ruins that remain are the prison bakery — now on private property, but still visible from a cul-de-sac — and an old prison fountain near the moucaya palm trees.

===CSG and the French Foreign Legion===
In 1965, the Guiana Space Centre was founded a little behind the town by the CNES. With the launch facility being used by the European Space Agency since 1975, the urbanisation of Kourou began in earnest.

The 3rd Foreign Infantry Regiment of the French Foreign Legion, whose mission is to protect the CSG, has had a base in the &quot;Forget&quot; neighbourhood since 1973. They clashed with the Creoles in 1985 and 2006.

==Demographics==
===Historical population===

===Migrations===

The places of birth of the 26,221 residents in the commune of Kourou at the 2015 census were the following:
*48.7% were born in French Guiana
*16.0% in Metropolitan France 
*2.0% in Martinique
*0.9% in Guadeloupe
*0.4% in other parts of Overseas France
*32.2% in foreign countries (notably Suriname, followed by Haiti and Brazil); among these, 30.7% were immigrants and 1.4% were children of French citizens born abroad

These were the countries of birth of the immigrants living in the commune of Kourou at the 2009 census:
* born in Suriname: 3,035
* born in Haiti: 1,857 
* born in Brazil: 1,806
* born in other countries: 1,327

==Climate==
Like most of French Guiana, Kourou has a tropical monsoon climate (Köppen &quot;Am&quot;) with a short dry season centered between the months of August and October when the Intertropical Convergence Zone is furthest north. During the remainder of the year rainfall is always heavy. Between November and July a total of can be expected in nine months, with rain on most days and very cloudy skies.

==Economy==

Kourou&#x27;s economy is largely dominated by the CSG, from which the European Ariane rockets are launched, as well as the Russian Soyuz and the Italian Vega rockets.

== Transportation ==
Kourou is served by Kourou Airport, located at the west of the city.

==Politics==

Kourou is the main town on an &quot;administrative district&quot; of French Guiana. Such a district is equivalent to a county in the United States. Kourou is represented in Paris as part of French Guiana&#x27;s 2nd constituency, which has been held by former Kourou city councilor Davy Rimane since 2022.

==Tourism==
* The &quot;Centre Spatial Guyanais (CSG)&quot; gets many visitors all year round.
* The &quot;Musée de l&#x27;Espace&quot; is a museum devoted to space and space exploration.
* The Salvation Islands: Of the three islands, only two, Île Royale and Île Saint-Joseph, can be visited. The third is Devil&#x27;s Island.
* &quot;Les Roches gravées&quot;: Indigenous rock art, not far from the small industrial zone called Pariacabo.
* There are several marked public footpaths in the jungle, of which the most well-known and used is the one on the &quot;Montagne des Singes&quot;.
* Kourou River: Many people go up the river on canoes or small boats to camp along the shore in open dwellings, or simply in hammocks.
* The ocean may not be clear (it is brown due to the Amazonian silt), but both it and the beaches are clean.

==In popular culture==
This commune is featured in the 2021 video game &quot;Battlefield 2042&quot; as the setting of multiplayer map Orbital.

<doc id="63117" wikidata="Q561724" url="?curid=63117" title="Paul Fort">
<text>Jules-Jean-Paul Fort (1 February 1872 – 20 April 1960) was a French poet associated with the Symbolist movement. At the age of 18, reacting against the Naturalistic theatre, Fort founded the Théâtre d&#x27;Art (1890–93). He also founded and edited the literary reviews &quot;Livre d&#x27;Art&quot; with Alfred Jarry and &quot;Vers et Prose&quot; (1905–14) with poet Guillaume Apollinaire, which published the work of Paul Valéry and other important Symbolist writers. Fort is notable for his enormous volume of poetry, having published more than thirty volumes of ballads and, according to Amy Lowell, for creating the polyphonic prose form in his &#x27;Ballades francaises&#x27;.

==Life and career==
Paul Fort was born in Reims, Marne &quot;département&quot;, France in 1872. His father, an insurance agent, moved the family to Paris in 1878. While attending secondary school at the Lycée Louis-le-Grand, he became a noted part of the artistic community of Montparnasse. He sought out the company of avant-garde artists and befriended André Gide and Pierre Louÿs. His work in the independent theatre movement spanned 1890 through 1892. Fort then devoted himself to poetry, publication, and advancing new writers. By 1912, his accomplishments and influence were such that he was given the title &quot;Prince of the Poets&quot; (honorific title given in France to poets, such as Verlaine and Mallarmé, after the death of their predecessor).

One of his works, &quot;La Ronde&quot;, has become famous worldwide as a plea for world friendship.

Fort died on 20 April 1960, in Montlhéry, a suburb south of Paris where he had lived since 1921, and is buried in the Cimetière de Montlhéry.

==Theater experience==

At 17, Fort frequented the Left Bank hangout of the Symbolist poets, the Café Voltaire (1, Place de l&#x27;Odéon), where the discussion included contemporary theatre. His activity there would soon cause his expulsion from high school. The group aimed to break with the reigning Naturalistic scene, including the Théâtre Libre created in 1887 by André Antoine, even though Fort admired Antoine and hoped to create a new theatre that would bring together the best of all theater forms, including naturalistic drama. Indeed, the theater Fort founded, The Mixed Theater (&quot;Le Théâtre Mixte&quot;), which debuted on 23 June 1890, announced an eclectic program of varying styles in both new works and long forgotten plays. Combining forces with Louis Germain&#x27;s Idealist Theatre (Le Théâtre Idéaliste), they presented four more plays on 5 and 12 October. These inaugural works included not only efforts by Fort and Germain but also Marc Legrand, le Sr de Chanmêlé, Charles Grandmougin, and Joseph Gayda. The critics, however, failed to find the plays in either program artistically revolutionary. Fort and Germain parted ways, leaving Fort to rename his company The Art Theatre (&quot;Le Théâtre d&#x27;Art&quot;) and to set up an office at 155, rue Montmartre. 

Fort&#x27;s two theatre ventures never had a single theatre home; instead, their programs circulated among eight rental performance spaces, mostly on the Right Bank. He engaged the leading Symbolist painters of the era to design and paint the sets and backdrops, particularly the &quot;Prophets&quot; of the Nabis group (Paul Sérusier, Emile Bernard, Maurice Denis, Paul Bonnard, Paul Ranson, Eduard Vuillard, and Henry Gabriel Ibels). Fort had appeared as an actor in the June program; Germain, the October. But an important discovery also debuted in the second program: Georgette Camée (d. 1957), a Paris Conservatory student, who became a seminal actor in the nascent avant-garde theatre movement, and would appear in 22 plays with the Théâtre d&#x27;Art. Among her rôles was Mephistopheles—a dandy with a monocle and in a smoking jacket—in their 1892 French adaptation of Christopher Marlowe&#x27;s &quot;Doctor Faustus&quot;. Although she won admiration as Geneviève in &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;, the 1893 opening event of the new Théâtre de l&#x27;Œuvre, it would be her only performance for the venture. She earned further acclaim in 1894 as Sara in the long-awaited stage presentation of Auguste de Villiers de L&#x27;Isle-Adam&#x27;s 1890 Symbolist drama &quot;Axël&quot;. She eventually married writer Maurice Pottecher and joined him in his own regional theatre endeavor, the Théâtre du Peuple, in Bussang, France.

A former actor for Antoine&#x27;s Théâtre Libre, Aurélien Lugné-Poe, who had returned from an abbreviated military service, joined the Théâtre d&#x27;Art in spring 1891, first appearing in Maurice Maeterlinck&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Intruse&quot;. For the next two years, he moved regularly between acting for the Théâtre d&#x27;Art and directing for the amateur company Le Cercle des Escholiers. Lugné-Poe performed in ten plays altogether for Fort, interpreting, most notably, the Maeterlinck rôles of the Old Man in &quot;L&#x27;Intruse&quot; (1891) and the First Blind Man in &quot;Les Aveugles&quot; (1891), as well as Satan in Jules Bois&#x27; &quot;Les Noces de Sathan&quot; (1892). He, along with Georgette Camée, forged the signature Symbolist acting style that conveys a religious reverie, with its hieratic poses and gestures, matched with solemn, psalmodized line readings. 

Under the two and a half years of Fort&#x27;s leadership, the Théâtre d&#x27;Art presented poetry recitations, older, little-seen dramatic work by Marlowe, Shelley, and Hugo, as well as new plays by Rachilde (&quot;La Voix du Sang&quot;, 1890; &quot;Madame la Mort&quot;, 1891), Théodore de Banville (&quot;Phyllis&quot;, 1891), Catulle Mendès (&quot;Le Soleil de Minuit&quot;, 1891), Paul Verlaine (&quot;Les Uns et les Autres&quot;, 1891), Remy de Gourmont (&quot;Théodat&quot;, 1891), and especially Maurice Maeterlinck (&quot;L&#x27;Intruse&quot; and Les Aveugles, both 1891) and Charles van Lerberghe&#x27;s &quot;Les Flaireurs&quot; (1892). As an artistic director, however, he proved himself ambitious but in over his head; he was often over budget, unable to deal with his creditors, and straining technically to produce difficult, opaque dramatic material. By 1892, with the Parisian critics begging him to make better choices, Fort sought in vain to produce Villiers de L&#x27;Isle-Adam&#x27;s &quot;Axël&quot; as the way to reinstate the company&#x27;s reputation. When it fell through, he tried to shepherd the Paris premiere of Maeterlinck&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; for March 1893, but Maeterlinck and co-producer Tola Dorian appear to have lost faith in him and the production was abruptly cancelled. This defeat prompted Fort to give up control of the enterprise altogether and turn his focus to poetry. Lugné-Poe took over the &quot;Pelléas and Mélisande&quot; project for its premiere in May 1893, which became the first step in launching his own Théâtre de l&#x27;Œuvre. In a relatively short time, the Théâtre d&#x27;Art had made its mark in the burgeoning avant-garde European theatre. As theatre historian Jacques Robichez has concluded, &quot;In brief, the history of the Théâtre d&#x27;Art is that of a failed but fertile experiment, and its principal—and perhaps only—merit is having engendered the Théâtre de l&#x27;Œuvre.&quot;

==Poet==

===Post-war creation===

Following the theatrical adventure he had achieved, he dedicated his life to poetry. He gave his first poems to the Mercure de France in 1896. Those poems consisted the debut of the Ballades françaises (17 volumes written entering 1922 and 1958). He begins to publish into the Le Livre d&#x27;art magazine in 1892 where it was relaunched in 1896 with Maurice Dumont. With the latter, he edited L&#x27;épreuve, Journal-Album d&#x27;art in 1894.

By 1903 he organized and held Tuesday poetic lectures at the Closerie des Lilas. In 1905, he began publishing the magazine Vers et prose with Moréas and Salmon, who notably edited the works Guillaume Apollinaire, Max Jacob, Pierre Louÿs. He edited it together with Paul Valéry. Pierre Louÿs, who wrote the prelude to the first volume of the &quot;Ballades&quot;, defines them as small poems in polymorphous form or in familiar alexandrins, but which bend towards the normal prose form, requiring the rules of rhythmic prose rather than those of verse diction.

Given the title “commandeur de la Légion d&#x27;honneur”, he helped to give the quartier du Montparnasse in Paris its artistic reputation. A poll of five literary magazines (Gil Blas, Comoedia, La Phalange, Les Loups and Les Nouvelles) gave him the title &quot;Prince of Poets&quot; in 1912. Then, 350 authors voted him as the true heir to Verlaine, Mallarmé and Léon Dierx.

In August 1913, his sixteen-year-old daughter Jeanne married futurist painter Gino Severini. Fort lead the ceremonies, Severini had as witnesses Guillaume Apollinaire, and Filippo Marinetti, the author of the Futurist Manifesto. Apollinaire wrote to Madeleine Pagès two years later: “I received the idiotic lyrical report of Paul Fort, the highfalutin prince of poets, who sings to battles in far away lands in a truly foolish language.”

==Poet Laureate of the Third Republic==

Paul Fort was a leading jury member of the Prix Jeunesse that was created in 1934. Running in 1943 for the Académie Goncourt seat left vacant by the death of Pierre Champion a year earlier, Fort lost to André Billy, though Billy was confirmed to the seat only after the Libération.

His work was banned by the CNE (National Writers&#x27; Committee of the intellectual resistance) at the end of war, but the interdiction was rescinded in a second list published in the Les Lettres françaises of 21 October 1944.

But he officially recovered when introducing an exhibition dedicated to him in 1954 at the Reims Carnegie Library.

In 1956, Paul married Germaine Pouget. His nephew married the daughter of Alfred Vallette (1858–1935), director of Mercure de France, and Marguerite Eymery (1860–1953), who wrote under the &quot;nom de plume&quot; Rachilde.

Paul Fort was buried at Montlhery on his own property, called Argenlieu.

== Legacy ==
Fort is mentioned by Ernest Hemingway as a customer of , in &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot;.

Dutch composer Marjo Tal set several of Fort&#x27;s works to music, as did British composer Eva Ruth Spalding and French composers Beatrice Siegrist, Gabriel Pierné and André Caplet.

Fort is mentioned in &quot;The Diary of Anaïs Nin&quot;, in the entry for October 1936 where Nin recounts the evening when they met at a party.

<text>The Avesta (, Book Pahlavi: (), Persian: ()) is the text corpus of religious literature of Zoroastrianism. All its texts are composed in the Avestan language and written in the Avestan alphabet. Modern editions of the Avesta are based the various manuscript traditions that have survived in India and Iran.

The individual texts of the Avesta were originally oral compositions. They were composed over a long period of several centuries during the Old Iranian period (possibly ranging from 15th century BCE - 4th century BCE). The written transmission began during the Sassanian period, with the creation of the Avestan alphabet. The resulting texts were then compiled into a comprehensive edition of the Avesta in 21 volumes. This edition was lost sometime after the 10th century CE and only a small part survived through a series of different manuscript traditions. The oldest surviving fragment of such a manuscript dates to 1323 CE.

Unlike the Sasanian Avesta, which was organized thematically, the surviving Avestan manuscripts correspond to the different ceremonies in which they are used. It is assumed that it was their regular use which ensured their survival to this day. The principal text is the &quot;Yasna&quot;, which takes its name from the corresponding ceremony, in which it is recited. The most important portion of the &quot;Yasna&quot; texts are the five Gathas, consisting of seventeen hymns attributed to Zoroaster himself. These hymns, together with five other short Old Avestan texts that are also part of the &quot;Yasna&quot;, are in the Old (or &#x27;Gathic&#x27;) Avestan language. The remainder of the &quot;Yasna&quot;&#x27;s texts are in Younger Avestan, which is not only from a later stage of the language, but also from a different geographic region.

Extensions to the Yasna ceremony include the texts of the &quot;Vendidad&quot; and the &quot;Visperad&quot;. The &quot;Visperad&quot; extensions consist mainly of additional invocations of the divinities (&quot;yazata&quot;s), while the &quot;Vendidad&quot; is a mixed collection of prose texts mostly dealing with purity laws. Even today, the &quot;Vendidad&quot; is the only liturgical text that is not recited entirely from memory. Some of the materials of the extended Yasna are from the &quot;Yashts&quot;, which are hymns to the individual &quot;yazata&quot;s. Unlike the &quot;Yasna&quot;, &quot;Visperad&quot; and &quot;Vendidad&quot;, the &quot;Yasht&quot;s and the other lesser texts of the Avesta are no longer used liturgically in high rituals. Aside from the &quot;Yasht&quot;s, these other lesser texts include the &quot;Nyayesh&quot; texts, the &quot;Gah&quot; texts, the &quot;Siroza&quot; and various other fragments. Together, these lesser texts are conventionally called &quot;Khordeh Avesta&quot; or &quot;Little Avesta&quot; texts. When the first &quot;Khordeh Avesta&quot; editions were printed in the 19th century, these texts (together with some non-Avestan language prayers) became a book of common prayer for lay people.

==Name==
The term &quot;Avesta&quot; originates from the 9th/10th-century works of Zoroastrian tradition in which the word appears as Middle Persian &quot;abestāg&quot;, Book Pahlavi &quot;ʾp(y)stʾkʼ&quot;. In that context, &quot;abestāg&quot; texts are portrayed as received knowledge and are distinguished from the exegetical commentaries (the &quot;zand&quot;) thereof. The literal meaning of the word &quot;abestāg&quot; is uncertain; it is generally acknowledged to be a learned borrowing from Avestan, but none of the suggested etymologies have been universally accepted. The widely repeated derivation from *&quot;upa-stavaka&quot; is from Christian Bartholomae (&quot;Altiranisches Wörterbuch&quot;, 1904), who interpreted &quot;abestāg&quot; as a descendant of a hypothetical reconstructed Old Iranian word for &quot;praise-song&quot; (Bartholomae: &quot;&quot;); but this word is not actually attested in any text.

==History==

===Zoroastrian tradition===
The Zoroastrian history of the Avesta, lies in the realm of legend and myth. The oldest surviving versions of these tales are found in the ninth to 11th century texts of Zoroastrian tradition (i.e. in the so-called &quot;Pahlavi books&quot;). The legends run as follows: The twenty-one &quot;nask&quot;s (&quot;books&quot;) of the Avesta were created by Ahura Mazda and brought by Zoroaster to his patron Vishtaspa (&quot;Denkard&quot; 4A, 3A). Supposedly, Vishtaspa (&quot;Dk&quot; 3A) or another Kayanian, Daray (&quot;Dk&quot; 4B), then had two copies made, one of which was stored in the treasury and the other in the royal archives (&quot;Dk&quot; 4B, 5). Following Alexander&#x27;s conquest, the Avesta was then supposedly destroyed or dispersed by the Greeks, after they had translated any scientific passages of which they could make use (&quot;AVN&quot; 7–9, &quot;Dk&quot; 3B, 8). Several centuries later, one of the Parthian emperors named Valaksh (one of the Vologases) supposedly then had the fragments collected, not only of those that had previously been written down, but also of those that had only been orally transmitted (&quot;Dk&quot; 4C).

The &quot;Denkard&quot; also records another legend related to the transmission of the Avesta. In this story, credit for collation and recension is given to the early Sasanian-era priest Tansar (high priest under Ardashir I, &quot;r.&quot; 224–242 CE, and Shapur I, 240/242–272 CE), who had the scattered works collected – of which he approved only a part as authoritative (&quot;Dk&quot; 3C, 4D, 4E). Tansar&#x27;s work was then supposedly completed by Adurbad Mahraspandan (high priest of Shapur II, &quot;r.&quot; 309–379 CE) who made a general revision of the canon and continued to ensure its orthodoxy (&quot;Dk&quot; 4F, &quot;AVN&quot; 1.12–1.16). A final revision was supposedly undertaken in the 6th century CE under Khosrow I (&quot;Dk&quot; 4G).

===Early Western scholarship===
Texts of the Avesta became available to European scholarship comparatively late, thus the study of Zoroastrianism in Western countries dates back to only the 18th century. Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron travelled to India in 1755, and discovered the texts among Indian Zoroastrian (Parsi) communities. He published a set of French translations in 1771, based on translations provided by a Parsi priest. Anquetil-Duperron&#x27;s translations were at first dismissed as a forgery in poor Sanskrit, but he was vindicated in the 1820s following Rasmus Rask&#x27;s examination of the Avestan language (&quot;A Dissertation on the Authenticity of the Zend Language&quot;, Bombay, 1821). Rask also established that Anquetil-Duperron&#x27;s manuscripts were a fragment of a much larger literature of sacred texts. Anquetil-Duperron&#x27;s manuscripts are at the (&#x27;P&#x27;-series manuscripts), while Rask&#x27;s collection now lies in the Royal Library, Denmark (&#x27;K&#x27;-series). Other large Avestan language manuscript collections are those of the British Museum (&#x27;L&#x27;-series), the K. R. Cama Oriental Library in Mumbai, the Meherji Rana library in Navsari, and at various university and national libraries in Europe.

In the early 20th century, the legend of the Parthian-era collation engendered a search for a &#x27;Parthian archetype&#x27; of the Avesta. According to the theory of Friedrich Carl Andreas (1902), the archaic nature of the Avestan texts was assumed to be due to preservation via written transmission, and unusual or unexpected spellings in the surviving texts were assumed to be reflections of errors introduced by Sasanian-era transcription from the Aramaic alphabet-derived Pahlavi scripts. The search for the &#x27;Arsacid archetype&#x27; was increasingly criticized in the 1940s and was eventually abandoned in the 1950s after Karl Hoffmann demonstrated that the inconsistencies noted by Andreas were actually due to unconscious alterations introduced by oral transmission. Hoffmann identifies these changes to be due, in part, to modifications introduced through recitation; in part to influences from other Iranian languages picked up on the route of transmission from somewhere in eastern Iran (i.e. Central Asia) via Arachosia and Sistan through to Persia; and in part due to the influence of phonetic developments in the Avestan language itself.

===Modern scholarhip===
The notion of an Arsacid-era collation and recension is generally rejected by modern scholarship. Instead, there is now a wide consensus that for most of their long history the Avesta&#x27;s various texts were handed down orally and independently of one another. Based on linguistic aspects, scholars like Kellens, Skjærvø and Hoffman have also identified a number of distinct phases, during which different parts of the Avestan corpus were composed, transmitted in either fluid or fixed form, as well as edited and redacted.

==== &quot;Oral transmission&quot; ====
The first phase comprises the creation of the Old Avestan texts, like the Gathas. Today, scholars consider a time frame between 1500 and 900 BCE to be possible, with a date close to 1000 BCE being considered likely by many. They must have crystallized early on, meaning their transmission became unchanged. During their long history, the Gathic texts seem to have been transmitted with the highest accuracy.

The second phase comprises the creation of the Young Avestan texts. These texts, which form the majority of the extant Avesta, originated in a later stage of the Avestan period separated from the Old Avestan time by several centuries. Scholars nowadays assume that this phase corresponds to a time frame from ca. 900-400 BCE. Due to a number of geographical references, there is a wide consensus that they were composed in the eastern portion of Greater Iran. While the Old Avestan material was handed down as a fixed liturgical corpus, the Young Avestan texts appear to have been transmitted during this time in an oral tradition which was still fluid. This means they were composed partly afresh with each generation of poet-priests, sometimes with the addition of new material. 

At some time, however, this fluid phase must have stopped as well and the process of transmission of the Young Avestan texts became fixed similar to the Old Avestan material. This second crystallization must have taken place during the Old Iranian period, as Young Avestan does not show any characteristics of Middle Iranian. The subsequent transmission took largely place in Western Iran as evidenced by alterations introduced by native Persian speakers. Scholars like Skjærvø and Kreyenbroek correlate this second crystallization with the adoption of Zoroastrianism by the Achaemenids. As a result, Persian- and Median-speaking priests would have become the primary group to transmit these texts. Having no longer an active command of Avestan, they would have decided to preserve both Old and Young Avestan text as faithfully as possible. Some Young Avestan texts, like the Vendidad, show non-Avestan influence and are therefore considered to have been redacted or otherwise altered by non-Avestan speakers after the main corpus became fixed. Regardless of such changes and redactions, the main Avestan corpus was now transmitted by people for whom Avestan was no longer a native but a purely liturgical languange.

==== &quot;Written transmission&quot; ====

It was not until around the 5th or 6th century CE that Avestan corpus was committed to written form, which lead to the creation of the Sasanian Avesta. This is seen as a turning point in the Avestan tradition since it separates the purely oral from the written transmission. The surviving texts of the Avesta, as they exist today, derive from a single master copy produced by that collation. That master copy, now lost, is known as the &#x27;Sassanian archetype&#x27;. The oldest surviving manuscript (&quot;K1&quot;) of an Avestan language text is dated 1323 CE.

The post-Sasanian phase saw a pronounced deterioration of the Avestan corpus. Summaries in the texts of the Zoroastrian tradition from the 9th/10th century indicate that the Sasanian Avesta was much larger than the Avesta that exists today. Only about one-quarter of the Avestan sentences or verses referred to by the 9th/10th century commentators can be found in the surviving texts. This suggests that an indeterminable number of juridical, historical and legendary texts have been lost since then. On the other hand, it appears that the most valuable portions of the canon, including all of the oldest texts, have survived. The likely reason for this is that the surviving materials represent those portions of the Avesta that were in regular liturgical use and therefore known by heart by the priests and not dependent for their preservation on the survival of particular manuscripts.

==Structure and content==
In its present form, the Avesta is a compilation from various sources, and its different parts date from different periods and vary widely in character. Both its extant as well as historical manuscripts seem to have consisted of the Avestan text jointly with translations, commentaries, glosses and instructions in Middle Persian. The term Avesta, however, only refers to the Avestan text itself, whereas the Middle Persian additions are referred to as Zend.

===The Sasanian Avesta===

According to the &quot;Denkard&quot;, the Avesta of the Sasanian period was organized into 21 &quot;nask&quot;s (volumes). This division was to mirror the structure of the 21-word-long &quot;Ahuna Vairya&quot; prayer: each of the three lines of the prayer consists of seven words. Correspondingly, the &quot;nask&quot;s are divided into three groups, of seven volumes per group. Originally, each volume had a word of the prayer as its name, which so marked a volume&#x27;s position relative to the other volumes. 
The first group of the nasks was the Gathic group. It contained the Gathas as well as long commentaries on them. It comprised the Stōd-yasn, the Sudgar, the Warshtmansr, the Bag, the Waštag, the Hadoxt and the Spand nask. Of these nasks, the Stod-yasn is extant in the Staota Yesnya, which forms the central portion of the High Liturgies like the Yasna and Visperad (see below). However, the other nasks only survive as fragments or are lost. 

The second group was the manthric group. Its content has been interpreted as connecting the first and third group. It comprised the Dāmdād, the Nāxtar, the Pāzag the Raθβištāiti, the Bariš, the Kaškaysraw and the Wištāsp-sāst nask. Only the Wištāsp-sāst nask may be extant in the Wištāsp Yasht manuscripts, which are part of several fragments collections (see below). All the other nasks are considered lost.

The third was the legal group, meaning its content covered topics of Zoroastrian jurisprudence. It comprised the Nikātum, the Duzd-sar-nizad, the Huspāram, the Sakātum, the Juddēwdād, the Čihrdād and the Bagān Yašt. The Bagān Yašt contained most of the Yashts of the extant Avesta (see below), whereas the Huspāram nask contained the Herbedestan and Nirangestan texts, which are extant in the fragments collections (see below). The Juddēwdād nask ist the only nask of the Sasanian Avesta which has survived intact as the Vendidad manuscripts (see below), meaning that both its Avestan and Middle Persian content as well as their arrangement have remained the same. Of the other nasks, only fragments may have survived.

===The extant Avesta===
The extant Avesta does no longer follow the division into nasks as described for the Sasanian Avesta. Instead, it is divided ritually (even though the organization of the &quot;nask&quot;s was not), but these are not fixed or canonical. Some scholars prefer to place the categories in two groups, one liturgical, and the other general. The following categorization is as described by Jean Kellens (see bibliography, below).

====The &quot;Yasna&quot;====
The &quot;Yasna&quot; (from &quot;yazišn&quot; &quot;worship, oblations&quot;, cognate with Sanskrit &quot;yajña&quot;), is the primary liturgical collection, named after the ceremony at which it is recited. It consists of 72 sections called the &quot;Ha-iti&quot; or &quot;Ha&quot;. The 72 threads of lamb&#x27;s wool in the &quot;Kushti&quot;, the sacred thread worn by Zoroastrians, represent these sections. The central portion of the Yasna is the &quot;Gathas&quot;, the oldest and most sacred portion of the Avesta, believed to have been composed by Zarathushtra (Zoroaster) himself. The &quot;Gathas&quot; are structurally interrupted by the &quot;Yasna Haptanghaiti&quot; (&quot;seven-chapter &quot;Yasna&quot;&quot;), which makes up chapters 35–42 of the &quot;Yasna&quot; and is almost as old as the &quot;Gathas&quot;, consists of prayers and hymns in honor of Ahura Mazda, the Yazatas, the Fravashi, Fire, Water, and Earth. The younger &quot;Yasna&quot;, though handed down in prose, may once have been metrical, as the &quot;Gathas&quot; still are.

====The &quot;Visperad&quot;====

The &quot;Visperad&quot; (from &quot;vîspe ratavo&quot;, &quot;(prayer to) all patrons&quot;) is a collection of supplements to the &quot;Yasna&quot;. The &quot;Visparad&quot; is subdivided into 23 or 24 &quot;kardo&quot; (sections) that are interleaved into the Yasna during a Visperad service (which is an extended Yasna service). The &quot;Visperad&quot; collection has no unity of its own, and is never recited separately from the Yasna.

====The &quot;Vendidad&quot;====

The &quot;Vendidad&quot; (or &quot;Vidēvdāt&quot;, a corruption of Avestan &quot;Vī-Daēvō-Dāta&quot;, &quot;Given Against the Demons&quot;) is an enumeration of various manifestations of evil spirits, and ways to confound them. The &quot;Vendidad&quot; includes all of the Juddēwdād &quot;nask&quot;, which is the only &quot;nask&quot; of the Sasanian Avesta that has survived in its entirety. The text consists of 22 &quot;Fargard&quot;s, fragments arranged as discussions between Ahura Mazda and Zoroaster. The first &quot;fargard&quot; is a dualistic creation myth, followed by the description of a destructive winter (compare Fimbulvetr) on the lines of the Flood myth. The second &quot;fargard&quot; recounts the legend of &quot;Yima&quot;. The remaining &quot;fargard&quot;s deal primarily with hygiene (care of the dead in particular) [&quot;fargard&quot; 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 16, 17, 19] as well as disease and spells to fight it [7, 10, 11, 13, 20, 21, 22]. &quot;Fargard&quot;s 4 and 15 discuss the dignity of wealth and charity, of marriage and of physical effort and the indignity of unacceptable social behaviour such as assault and breach of contract, and specify the penances required to atone for violations thereof. The &quot;Vendidad&quot; is an ecclesiastical code, not a liturgical manual, and there is a degree of moral relativism apparent in the codes of conduct. The &quot;Vendidad&quot;″s different parts vary widely in character and in age. Some parts may be comparatively recent in origin although the greater part is very old.

The Vendidad originally was one of the legal nasks of the Sasanian Avesta and therefore, unlike the Yasna and the Visparad, is a text dealing with laws rather than the record of a liturgical ceremony. However, the text is used within the so called &quot;Videvdat&quot; ceremony, in which the Yasna is recited with all the chapters of both the Visparad and the Vendidad inserted at appropriate points. This ceremony is only performed at night.

====The &quot;Yasht&quot;s====
The &quot;Yasht&quot;s (from &quot;yešti&quot;, &quot;worship by praise&quot;) are a collection of 21 hymns, each dedicated to a particular divinity or divine concept. Three hymns of the Yasna liturgy that &quot;worship by praise&quot; are—in tradition—also nominally called &quot;yasht&quot;s, but are not counted among the &quot;Yasht&quot; collection since the three are a part of the primary liturgy. The &quot;Yasht&quot;s vary greatly in style, quality and extent. In their present form, they are all in prose but analysis suggests that they may at one time have been in verse.

====The &quot;Siroza&quot;====
The &quot;Siroza&quot; (&quot;thirty days&quot;) is an enumeration and invocation of the 30 divinities presiding over the days of the month. (cf. Zoroastrian calendar). The &quot;Siroza&quot; exists in two forms, the shorter (&quot;little &quot;Siroza&quot;&quot;) is a brief enumeration of the divinities with their epithets in the genitive. The longer (&quot;great &quot;Siroza&quot;&quot;) has complete sentences and sections, with the &quot;yazata&quot;s being addressed in the accusative.

The Siroza is never recited as a whole, but is a source for individual sentences devoted to particular divinities, to be inserted at appropriate points in the liturgy depending on the day and the month.

====The &quot;Nyayesh&quot;es====
The five &quot;Nyayesh&quot;es, abbreviated &quot;Ny.&quot;, are prayers for regular recitation by both priests and laity. They are addressed to the Sun and Mithra (recited together thrice a day), to the Moon (recited thrice a month), and to the Waters and to Fire. The &quot;Nyayesh&quot;es are composite texts containing selections from the Gathas and the Yashts, as well as later material.

====The &quot;Gah&quot;s====

The five &quot;gāh&quot;s are invocations to the five divinities that watch over the five divisions (&quot;gāh&quot;s) of the day. &quot;Gāh&quot;s are similar in structure and content to the five &quot;Nyayesh&quot;es.

====The &quot;Afrinagan&quot;s====
The &quot;Afrinagan&quot;s are four &quot;blessing&quot; texts recited on a particular occasion: the first in honor of the dead, the second on the five epagomenal days that end the year, the third is recited at the six seasonal feasts, and the fourth at the beginning and end of summer.

====Fragments====
All material in the &quot;Avesta&quot; that is not already present in one of the other categories is placed in a &quot;fragments&quot; category, which – as the name suggests – includes incomplete texts. There are altogether more than 20 fragment collections, many of which have no name (and are then named after their owner/collator) or only a Middle Persian name. The more important of the fragment collections are the &quot;Nirangistan&quot; fragments (18 of which constitute the &quot;Ehrbadistan&quot;); the &quot;Wištāsp Yasht&quot; (see Sasanian Avesta), the &quot;Pursishniha&quot; &quot;questions,&quot; also known as &quot;Fragments Tahmuras&quot;; and the &quot;Hadoxt nask&quot; &quot;volume of the scriptures&quot; with two fragments of eschatological significance.

== Avesta manuscripts ==
The Avesta consists of 5 parts, which are, Yasna, Vispered, Yashts, Vendidad, Khordeh Avest, The oldest surviving fragment of a text dates to 1323 CEA. V. Williams Jackson says that no single manuscript contains the entire Avesta. The earliest passage composed in the book is the Gatha, and there is a gradual general consensus in favour of placing the Gatha, around 1000 BC. There is a now wide consensus that for most of their long history the Avesta&#x27;s various texts were handed down orally and independently of one another

<doc id="63121" wikidata="Q4290" url="?curid=63121" title="Investment">
<text>Investment is traditionally defined as the &quot;commitment of resources to achieve later benefits&quot;. If an investment involves money, then it can be defined as a &quot;commitment of money to receive more money later&quot;. From a broader viewpoint, an investment can be defined as &quot;to tailor the pattern of expenditure and receipt of resources to optimise the desirable patterns of these flows&quot;. When expenditures and receipts are defined in terms of money, then the net monetary receipt in a time period is termed cash flow, while money received in a series of several time periods is termed cash flow stream.

In finance, the purpose of investing is to generate a return on the invested asset. The return may consist of a capital gain (profit) or loss, realised if the investment is sold, unrealised capital appreciation (or depreciation) if yet unsold. It may also consist of periodic income such as dividends, interest, or rental income. The return may also include currency gains or losses due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Investors generally expect higher returns from riskier investments. When a low-risk investment is made, the return is also generally low. Similarly, high risk comes with a chance of high losses. Investors, particularly novices, are often advised to diversify their portfolio. Diversification has the statistical effect of reducing overall risk.

== Types of financial investments ==

In modern economies, traditional investments include:
* Stocks - Business ownership, known as equity, in publicly traded companies
* Bonds - loans to governments and businesses traded on public markets
* Cash - holding a particular currency, whether in anticipation of spending or to take advantage of or hedge against changes in a currency exchange rate
* Real estate, which can be rented to provide ongoing income or resold if it increases in value

Alternative investments include:
* Private equity in businesses that are not publicly traded on a stock exchange, often involving venture capital funds, angel investors, or equity crowdfunding
* Other loans, including mortgages
* Commodities, such as precious metals like gold, agricultural products like potatoes, and energy deliveries like natural gas
* Collectables, including art, coins, vintage cars, postage stamps, and wine
* Carbon offsets and credits
* Digital entities like cryptocurrency and non-fungible tokens
* Hedge funds that use sophisticated techniques like:
** Derivatives, the value of which is determined by a contract and is derived by calculation from the performance of some other sort of underlying investment; these include forwards, futures, options, swaps, collateralized debt obligations, credit default swaps, and Tax Receivable Agreements
** Leveraged investing, which is the investment of borrowed money
** Short selling, which typically uses leverage and derivatives to bet that the value of a stock will decline

== Investment and risk ==
An investor may bear a risk of loss of some or all of their capital invested. Investment differs from arbitrage, in which profit is generated without investing capital or bearing risk.

Savings bear the (normally remote) risk that the financial provider may default.

Foreign currency savings also bear foreign exchange risk: if the currency of a savings account differs from the account holder&#x27;s home currency, then there is the risk that the exchange rate between the two currencies will move unfavourably so that the value of the savings account decreases, measured in the account holder&#x27;s home currency.

Even investing in tangible assets like property has its risk. And similar to most risks, property buyers can seek to mitigate any potential risk by taking out mortgage and by borrowing at a lower loan to security ratio.

In contrast with savings, investments tend to carry more risk, in the form of both a wider variety of risk factors and a greater level of uncertainty.

Industry to industry volatility is more or less of a risk depending. In biotechnology, for example, investors look for big profits on companies that have small market capitalizations but can be worth hundreds of millions quite quickly. The risk is high because approximately 90% of biotechnology products researched do not make it to market due to regulations and the complex demands within pharmacology as the average prescription drug takes 10 years and US$2.5 billion worth of capital.

== History ==
In the medieval Islamic world, the qirad was a major financial instrument. This was an arrangement between one or more investors and an agent where the investors entrusted capital to an agent who then traded with it in hopes of making a profit. Both parties then received a previously settled portion of the profit, though the agent was not liable for any losses. Many will notice that the &quot;qirad&quot; is similar to the institution of the commenda later used in western Europe, though whether the qirad transformed into the commenda or the two institutions evolved independently cannot be stated with certainty.

In the early 1900s, purchasers of stocks, bonds, and other securities were described in media, academia, and commerce as speculators. Since the Wall Street crash of 1929, and particularly by the 1950s, the term &quot;investment&quot; had come to denote the more conservative end of the securities spectrum, while &quot;speculation&quot; was applied by financial brokers and their advertising agencies to higher risk securities much in vogue at that time. Since the last half of the 20th century, the terms &quot;speculation&quot; and &quot;speculator&quot; have specifically referred to higher risk ventures.

==Investment strategies==

=== Value investing ===

A value investor buys assets that they believe to be undervalued (and sells overvalued ones). To identify undervalued securities, a value investor uses analysis of the financial reports of the issuer to evaluate the security. Value investors employ accounting ratios, such as earnings per share and sales growth, to identify securities trading at prices below their worth.

Warren Buffett and Benjamin Graham are notable examples of value investors. Graham and Dodd&#x27;s seminal work, &quot;Security Analysis&quot;, was written in the wake of the Wall Street Crash of 1929.

The price to earnings ratio (P/E), or earnings multiple, is a particularly significant and recognized fundamental ratio, with a function of dividing the share price of the stock, by its earnings per share. This will provide the value representing the sum investors are prepared to expend for each dollar of company earnings. This ratio is an important aspect, due to its capacity as measurement for the comparison of valuations of various companies. A stock with a lower P/E ratio will cost less per share than one with a higher P/E, taking into account the same level of financial performance; therefore, it essentially means a low P/E is the preferred option.

An instance in which the price to earnings ratio has a lesser significance is when companies in different industries are compared. For example, although it is reasonable for a telecommunications stock to show a P/E in the low teens, in the case of hi-tech stock, a P/E in the 40s range is not unusual. When making comparisons, the P/E ratio can give you a refined view of a particular stock valuation.

For investors paying for each dollar of a company&#x27;s earnings, the P/E ratio is a significant indicator, but the price-to-book ratio (P/B) is also a reliable indication of how much investors are willing to spend on each dollar of company assets. In the process of the P/B ratio, the share price of a stock is divided by its net assets; any intangibles, such as goodwill, are not taken into account. It is a crucial factor of the price-to-book ratio, due to it indicating the actual payment for tangible assets and not the more difficult valuation of intangibles. Accordingly, the P/B could be considered a comparatively conservative metric.

=== Growth investing ===
Growth investors seek investments they believe are likely to have higher earnings or greater value in the future. To identify such stocks, growth investors often evaluate measures of current stock value as well as predictions of future financial performance. Growth investors seek profits through capital appreciation – the gains earned when a stock is sold at a higher price than what it was purchased for. The price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple is also used for this type of investment; growth stock are likely to have a P/E higher than others in its industry. According to Investopedia author Troy Segal and U.S. Department of State Fulbright fintech research awardee Julius Mansa, growth investing is best suited for investors who prefer relatively shorter investment horizons, higher risks, and are not seeking immediate cash flow through dividends.

Some investors attribute the introduction of the growth investing strategy to investment banker Thomas Rowe Price Jr., who tested and popularized the method in 1950 by introducing his mutual fund, the T. Rowe Price Growth Stock Fund. Price asserted that investors could reap high returns by &quot;investing in companies that are well-managed in fertile fields.&quot;

A new form of investing that seems to have caught the attention of investors is Venture Capital. Venture Capital is independently managed dedicated pools of capital that focus on equity or equity-linked investments in privately held, high growth companies.

=== Momentum investing ===
Momentum investors generally seek to buy stocks that are currently experiencing a short-term uptrend, and they usually sell them once this momentum starts to decrease. Stocks or securities purchased for momentum investing are often characterized by demonstrating consistently high returns for the past three to twelve months. However, in a bear market, momentum investing also involves short-selling securities of stocks that are experiencing a downward trend, because it is believed that these stocks will continue to decrease in value. Essentially, momentum investing generally relies on the principle that a consistently up-trending stock will continue to grow, while a consistently down-trending stock will continue to fall.

Economists and financial analysts have not reached a consensus on the effectiveness of using the momentum investing strategy. Rather than evaluating a company&#x27;s operational performance, momentum investors instead utilize trend lines, moving averages, and the Average Directional Index (ADX) to determine the existence and strength of trends.

=== Dollar cost averaging ===
Dollar cost averaging (DCA), also known in the UK as pound-cost averaging, is the process of consistently investing a certain amount of money across regular increments of time, and the method can be used in conjunction with value investing, growth investing, momentum investing, or other strategies. For example, an investor who practices dollar-cost averaging could choose to invest $200 a month for the next 3 years, regardless of the share price of their preferred stock(s), mutual funds, or exchange-traded funds.

Many investors believe that dollar-cost averaging helps minimize short-term volatility by spreading risk out across time intervals and avoiding market timing. Research also shows that DCA can help reduce the total average cost per share in an investment because the method enables the purchase of more shares when their price is lower, and less shares when the price is higher. However, dollar-cost averaging is also generally characterized by more brokerage fees, which could decrease an investor&#x27;s overall returns.

The term &quot;dollar-cost averaging&quot; is believed to have first been coined in 1949 by economist and author Benjamin Graham in his book, &quot;The Intelligent Investor.&quot; Graham asserted that investors that use DCA are &quot;likely to end up with a satisfactory overall price for all [their] holdings.&quot;

=== Micro-investing ===
Micro-investing is a type of investment strategy that is designed to make investing regular, accessible and affordable, especially for those who may not have a lot of money to invest or who are new to investing.

==Intermediaries and collective investments==
Investments are often made indirectly through intermediary financial institutions. These intermediaries include pension funds, banks, and insurance companies. They may pool money received from a number of individual end investors into funds such as investment trusts, unit trusts, and SICAVs to make large-scale investments. Each individual investor holds an indirect or direct claim on the assets purchased, subject to charges levied by the intermediary, which may be large and varied.

Approaches to investment sometimes referred to in marketing of collective investments include dollar cost averaging and market timing.

==Investment valuation==
Free cash flow measures the cash a company generates which is available to its debt and equity investors, after allowing for reinvestment in working capital and capital expenditure. High and rising free cash flow, therefore, tend to make a company more attractive to investors.

The debt-to-equity ratio is an indicator of capital structure. A high proportion of debt, reflected in a high debt-to-equity ratio, tends to make a company&#x27;s earnings, free cash flow, and ultimately the returns to its investors, riskier or volatile. Investors compare a company&#x27;s debt-to-equity ratio with those of other companies in the same industry, and examine trends in debt-to-equity ratios and free cashflow.

<text>Bon Jovi is an American rock band formed in Sayreville, New Jersey in 1983. The band consists of singer Jon Bon Jovi, keyboardist David Bryan, drummer Tico Torres, guitarists John Shanks and Phil X, percussionist Everett Bradley, and bassist Hugh McDonald. Original bassist Alec John Such left the band in 1994, and longtime guitarist and co-songwriter Richie Sambora left in 2013. 

In 1984, Bon Jovi released their self-titled debut album, and its single &quot;Runaway&quot; managed to reach the Top 40 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In 1986, the band achieved widespread success and global recognition with their third album, &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot;, which included three Top 10 singles on the Billboard Hot 100, two of which reached No. 1: &quot;You Give Love a Bad Name&quot; and &quot;Livin&#x27; on a Prayer&quot;. Their fourth album, &quot;New Jersey&quot; (1988), was also commercially successful, featuring five Top 10 singles, including the number ones &quot;Bad Medicine&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You&quot;. The band toured and recorded during the late 1980s, culminating in the 1988–90 New Jersey Syndicate Tour.

In 1992, the band returned with the double-platinum &quot;Keep the Faith&quot;, which included the hit “Bed of Roses”. This was followed by their biggest-selling and longest-charting single &quot;Always” in 1994. The album &quot;These Days&quot; (1995), proved a bigger success in Europe than in the US, producing four Top Ten singles in the UK. Following a second hiatus, their 2000 album &quot;Crush&quot;, particularly the lead single, &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot;, successfully introduced the band to a younger audience. The platinum albums &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; (2005) and &quot;Lost Highway&quot; (2007) saw the band incorporate elements of country music into some songs, including the 2006 single &quot;Who Says You Can&#x27;t Go Home&quot;, which won the band a Grammy Award and became the first single by a rock band to reach No. 1 on the country charts. &quot;The Circle&quot; (2009) marked a return to the band&#x27;s rock sound. The band further success touring, with the 2005–06 Have a Nice Day Tour and 2007–08 Lost Highway Tour ranking among the Top 20 highest-grossing concert tours of the 2000s. After releasing &quot;Because We Can&quot; in 2013, lead guitarist Richie Sambora left the band, just before a concert during the supporting tour to spend more time with family. The band released their first studio album without Sambora, &quot;Burning Bridges&quot;, in 2015 and the follow-up album &quot;This House Is Not for Sale&quot; in 2016, touring it in 2017–19. Their album &quot;2020&quot; was reworked to include songs inspired by the COVID-19 pandemic and George Floyd protests.

Bon Jovi has been credited with bridging &quot;the gap between heavy metal and pop with style and ease&quot;. The band has released 16 studio albums, five compilations and three live albums. They have sold more than 130 million records worldwide, making them one of the best-selling American rock bands, and performed 2,700 concerts in 50 countries for 34 million fans. Bon Jovi was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006, and the US Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018. The band received the Award of Merit at the American Music Awards in 2004.

==History==

===Formation and &quot;Runaway&quot; (1980–1983)===

Jon Bon Jovi began performing music live in 1975, at the age of 13, playing piano and guitar with his first band, Raze. At 16, Jon met David Bryan and formed a band called Atlantic City Expressway. Still in his teens, Bon Jovi played in the band John Bongiovi and the Wild Ones at clubs such as the Fast Lane and opening for local acts. By 1980, he had formed another band, the Rest, and opened up for New Jersey acts such as Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes. Also in 1980, Jon recorded his first single, &quot;Runaway&quot; in his cousin&#x27;s studio, backed up by studio musicians. The song was played by a local radio station on a compilation tape.

By mid-1982, out of school and working part-time at a women&#x27;s shoe store, Jon Bon Jovi took a job at the Power Station Studios, a Manhattan recording facility where his cousin Tony Bongiovi was co-owner. Jon made several demosincluding one produced by Billy Squierand sent them to record companies, though failing to make an impact. His first professional recording was as lead vocals in &quot;R2-D2 We Wish You a Merry Christmas,&quot; which was part of the &quot;Christmas in the Stars&quot; album which his cousin co-produced.

In 1983, Jon visited a local radio station WAPP 103.5FM &quot;The Apple&quot; in Lake Success, New York, to write and sing the jingles for the station. He spoke with DJ Chip Hobart and to the promotion director, John Lassman, who suggested Jon let WAPP include the song &quot;Runaway&quot; on the station&#x27;s compilation album of local homegrown talent. Jon was reluctant, but eventually gave them the song, which he had re-recorded in 1982 (following a rough early recording in 1981) with local studio musicians whom he designated The All Star Reviewguitarist Tim Pierce, keyboardist Roy Bittan (from Bruce Springsteen’s E Street Band), drummer Frankie LaRocka, and bassist Hugh McDonald.

The song began to get airplay in the New York area, then other sister stations in major markets picked up the song. In March 1983, Bon Jovi called David Bryan, who in turn called bassist Alec John Such and an experienced drummer named Tico Torres, both formerly of the band Phantom&#x27;s Opera. Tapped to play lead guitar for a short tour supporting &quot;Runaway&quot; was Bon Jovi&#x27;s friend and neighbor, Dave Sabo (&quot;The Snake&quot;), though he never officially joined the band. He and Jon promised each other that whoever made it first, would help out the other. Sabo later went on to form the group Skid Row. Jon saw and was impressed with hometown guitarist Richie Sambora who was recommended by fellow bassist Alec John Such and drummer Tico Torres. Sambora had toured with Joe Cocker, played with a group called Mercy and had been called up to audition for Kiss. He also played on the album &quot;Lessons&quot;, originally intended for release in 1982 with the band Message for which Alec John Such was the bassist. Message was originally signed to Led Zeppelin&#x27;s Swan Song Records label, although the album was never officially released at the time. Meanwhile, WAPP, the station that had first played &quot;Runaway&quot; worked with WOR-TV (now WWOR-TV) in nearby Secaucus, NJ on a music video show, Rock 9 Videos, for a short time in 1984.

Tico Torres was also an experienced musician, having recorded and played live with Phantom&#x27;s Opera, The Marvelettes, and Chuck Berry. He appeared on 26 records and had recently recorded with Franke and the Knockouts, a Jersey band with hit singles during the early 1980s.

David Bryan had quit the band that he and Bon Jovi had founded in order to study medicine. While in college, he realized that he wanted to pursue music full-time, and was accepted to Juilliard School, a New York music school. When Bon Jovi called his friend and said that he was putting together a band, and a record deal looked likely, Bryan followed Bon Jovi&#x27;s lead and gave up his studies.

===&quot;Bon Jovi&quot;, , &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; and &quot;New Jersey&quot; (1984–1989)===

Once the band began playing showcases and opening for local talent, they caught the attention of record executive Derek Shulman, who signed them to Mercury Records and who was part of the PolyGram company. Because Jon Bon Jovi wanted a group name, Pamela Maher, a friend of Richard Fischer and an employee of Doc McGhee, suggested they call themselves Bon Jovi, following the example of the other famous two-word bands such as Van Halen. This name was chosen instead of the original idea of Johnny Electric. Pamela&#x27;s suggestion of the name was met with little enthusiasm, but two years later they hit the charts under that name.

With the help of their new manager Doc McGhee they recorded the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Bon Jovi&quot;, which was released on January 21, 1984. The album included the band&#x27;s first hit single, &quot;Runaway&quot;, reaching the top forty on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The album peaked at number forty-three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. The group soon found itself opening for Scorpions in U.S. and for Kiss in Europe.

In 1985, Bon Jovi&#x27;s second album, , was released. The band released three singles: &quot;Only Lonely&quot;, &quot;In and Out of Love&quot; and the ballad &quot;Silent Night&quot;. The album peaked at number thirty-seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified Gold by RIAA. While the album did not sell as well as the band had hoped, it allowed Bon Jovi to get out on the road touring again. In May 1985, Bon Jovi headlined venues in Japan and Europe. At the end of the European tour, the band began a six-month run of U.S. tour dates supporting Ratt. In the midst of that tour, they appeared at the Texas Jam and Castle Donington&#x27;s Monsters of Rock concerts in England. The band also performed at the first Farm Aid in 1985.
After two moderately successful albums, the group changed its approach and hired professional songwriter Desmond Child as a collaborator. Bruce Fairbairn was chosen to produce and, in early 1986, Bon Jovi moved to Vancouver, Canada to spend six months recording a third album. They named it &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; after visiting a strip club in Vancouver. On August 16, 1986, &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; was released and it spent eight weeks atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The first two singles from the album, &quot;You Give Love a Bad Name&quot; and &quot;Livin&#x27; on a Prayer&quot;, both hit number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; was named 1987&#x27;s top-selling album by &quot;Billboard&quot;, and &quot;Livin&#x27; On A Prayer&quot; won an MTV Video Music Award for Best Stage Performance. The band won an award for Favorite Pop/Rock Band at the American Music Awards and an award for Favorite Rock Group at the People&#x27;s Choice Awards. When &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; was released in August 1986, Bon Jovi was the support act for 38 Special. By the end of 1986, Bon Jovi were well into six months of headline dates in arenas across America. In August 1987, they headlined England&#x27;s Monsters of Rock festival. During their set, Dee Snider, Bruce Dickinson and Paul Stanley guested to perform &quot;We&#x27;re an American Band&quot;. The band ended the year having headlined 130 shows in the &quot;Tour Without End&quot;, grossing $28,400,000. Asked what this breakthrough to worldwide fame meant, Jon Bon Jovi said, &quot;Everything is bigger, and it moves twice as fast. You&#x27;re recognized twice as often. This is bigger, the whole world gets bigger. You have to sell more records, be huger. You get smarter and you understand the business a little more, so it&#x27;s more responsibility. You understand it now, and you want to make sure everything goes right&quot;.

Determined to prove that the success of &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; was not a fluke, Bon Jovi released their fourth effort, &quot;New Jersey&quot;, in September 1988 which peaked at number one in the U.S., Canada, UK, Ireland, New Zealand and Australia. The album produced five Top 10 hits on the Billboard Hot 100, giving Bon Jovi the record for the most Top 10 singles spawned by a hard rock album. Two of the hits, &quot;Bad Medicine&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be There for You&quot;, reached number one. The album&#x27;s three other singles, &quot;Born to Be My Baby&quot;, &quot;Lay Your Hands on Me&quot;, and &quot;Living in Sin&quot;, reached the top ten. Bon Jovi made the news when the video for &quot;Living In Sin&quot; was banned by MTV for sexual content; after the video was re-edited, MTV put it in heavy rotation. Bon Jovi mounted another huge worldwide tour that continued throughout 1989 and 1990. They visited more than 22 countries and performed more than 232 shows. On June 11, 1989, the band performed a homecoming concert at Giants Stadium in New Jersey; the venue was sold out. In August 1989, the band headed to the Soviet Union for the Moscow Music Peace Festival. Bon Jovi were officially sanctioned by the Soviet government to perform in the Soviet Union, and &quot;New Jersey&quot; was legally released in the USSR.

The exhaustion of recording &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; and &quot;New Jersey&quot; back to back and going on highly paced world tours took its toll. By the end of the &quot;New Jersey&quot; tour, the band had 16 months of concerts under its belt. The bandmates were exhausted physically, mentally and emotionally. Following the final tour date in Mexico, and without any clear plans for their future, the members of the band simply went home. The band has since stated that there were few if any goodbyes between them. During the time they took off from the scene, members of the band retreated to their own projects and showed no desire to make another album.

===&quot;Keep the Faith&quot;, &quot; Cross Road&quot; and &quot;These Days&quot; (1992–1996)===
Disillusioned with the music business and unhappy with the status quo, Jon Bon Jovi fired his management, business advisers, and agents (including long-time manager Doc McGhee) in 1991. Jon took on the management responsibilities himself by closing ranks and creating &quot;Bon Jovi Management&quot;. In October 1991, the band went to a Caribbean island of St. Thomas to discuss plans for the future. They managed to resolve their differences by allowing each member to speak about his feelings without interruption from each other. Upon resolving their issues, they headed back into the Vancouver Little Mountain studios with Bob Rock to work on the band&#x27;s fifth album in January 1992.

Bon Jovi&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Keep the Faith&quot;, was released in November 1992, representing &quot;the beginning of a new chapter in the history of Bon Jovi&quot; and marking a change in the band&#x27;s sound and image. The album turned away from heavy drums and wild guitar solos, but instead introduced a more mature sound of Bon Jovi and contained more serious lyrics. The media focused considerable attention on Jon Bon Jovi&#x27;s hair. When Jon Bon Jovi cut his hair he made headlines on CNN. To promote &quot;Keep The Faith&quot; they returned to their roots playing a few dates at the small New Jersey clubs where they had started their career. The band appeared on &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; but that was different from the other episodes of MTV Unplugged series. The performance captures Bon Jovi in an intimate, &quot;in the round&quot; experience, performing acoustic and electric renditions of classic hits (Bon Jovi and non-Bon Jovi tracks) and new material from &quot;Keep the Faith&quot;. The concert was released commercially in 1993 as &quot;Keep the Faith: An Evening with Bon Jovi&quot;. The album managed to reach Double Platinum status by the RIAA and produced the Top 10 hit &quot;Bed of Roses&quot; while the title track hit number one on the Mainstream Rock Tracks. Bon Jovi embarked on an extensive international world tour for the album, visiting countries the band had never seen before and headlining stadiums in South America, Europe, Asia and Australia. They visited 37 countries, performed 177 shows and seen them play to 2.5 million fans on the Keep the Faith Tour/I&#x27;ll Sleep When I&#x27;m Dead Tour.

In October 1994, Bon Jovi released a greatest hits album titled &quot;Cross Road&quot;, with two new tracks: &quot;Always&quot; and &quot;Someday I&#x27;ll Be Saturday Night&quot;. The first single from the album, &quot;Always&quot;, became Bon Jovi&#x27;s highest selling single and stayed on top ten of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 for six months. In the UK, &quot;Cross Road&quot; became the bestselling album of 1994. That year Bon Jovi won an award for &quot;Best Selling Rock Band&quot; at the World Music Awards.

That same year, bassist Alec John Such left the band, the first lineup change since Bon Jovi began. Hugh McDonald who was the bassist on &quot;Runaway&quot;, unofficially replaced Such as bassist. Jon Bon Jovi said, regarding the departure of Such: &quot;Of course it hurts. But I learned to accept and respect it. The fact that I&#x27;m a workaholic, studio in, studio out, stage on, stage off, want to be dealing with music day and night, doesn&#x27;t mean everyone else has to adjust to that pace. Alec wanted to quit for a while now, so it didn&#x27;t come as a complete surprise.&quot;

Bon Jovi&#x27;s sixth studio album, &quot;These Days&quot;, was released in June 1995, during which time the band was on European tour. The album debuted at number one in UK and spent four consecutive weeks at the top position. The album also reached number one in Ireland, Germany, Australia, Japan and many other countries. The album&#x27;s first single was the rhythm and blues influenced ballad &quot;This Ain&#x27;t a Love Song&quot;. With a video filmed in Thailand, &quot;This Ain&#x27;t a Love Song&quot; reached top twenty on the Billboard Hot 100, and was the only significant U.S. hit from the album. However, the album produced four UK top ten hits (&quot;This Aint A Love Song&quot;, &quot;Something for the Pain&quot;, &quot;Lie to Me&quot; and &quot;These Days&quot;). That year the band earned a BRIT Award for best international band and also won a MTV Europe Music Award for Best Rock. It was followed by These Days Tour. In June 1995, Bon Jovi sold out three-nights at London&#x27;s historical &quot;Wembley Stadium&quot;. The concerts were documented for &quot;Bon Jovi: Live From London&quot;. Bon Jovi visited 43 countries and performed 126 shows on &quot;These Days Tour&quot;.

Following the overwhelming success of the &quot;These Days Tour&quot;, the members of Bon Jovi went their separate ways. But unlike the period following the New Jersey tour, tainted with uncertainty, this hiatus was a conscious group decision. The members of Bon Jovi agreed to a self-imposed two-year sabbatical from the band.

===&quot;Crush&quot;, &quot;Bounce&quot; and &quot;This Left Feels Right&quot; (1999–2003)===
Bon Jovi reunited in 1999 to record the song &quot;Real Life&quot; for the movie &quot;EdTV&quot;. David Bryan was recovering from an accident in which he nearly severed his finger.

After a nearly four-year hiatus, during which several band members worked on independent projects, Bon Jovi regrouped to begin work on their next studio album. In June 2000, &quot;Crush&quot; was released as the band&#x27;s seventh studio album and constituted something of a comeback. The first single, &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot;, was noted as one of the group&#x27;s most successful releases in a decade and most importantly, becoming a symbol of the band&#x27;s longevity as they prevailed through many different changes in the mainstream rock scene with admirable success. &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; helped introduce them to a new, younger fan base. The band received two Grammy nominations for Best Rock Album (&quot;Crush&quot;) and Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal (&quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot;). The video for &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot; won the My VH1 Music Awards for &quot;My Favorite Video&quot;.

Bon Jovi played two sold-out concerts at London&#x27;s historic Wembley Stadium on August 19–20, 2000, becoming the last concerts held at the legendary venue before its demolition. That year the band played to 1.1 million fans in 40 arena and stadium venues across North America, Europe and Japan. While on tour, Bon Jovi released a collection of live performances from throughout their career in an album titled &quot;One Wild Night Live 1985–2001&quot;. This was Bon Jovi&#x27;s first-ever live album. The songs were culled from archives of recorded material the band had been collecting from their earliest days on the road right through the current tour. The band sold out two homecoming concerts at New Jersey&#x27;s Giants Stadium on July 27–28, 2001. The broadcast broke ratings records for the VH-1 network. At the end of the year Bon Jovi awarded for &quot;Hottest Live Show&quot; at the 2001 My VH1 Music Awards.

The members of the band had anticipated a brief vacation before work would begin on the band&#x27;s 8th studio album but on September 11 the world changed. Within days of the terrorist attacks, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora had filmed Public Service Announcements for the Red Cross, recorded &quot;America The Beautiful&quot; for the NFL and performed as part of the historic &quot;&quot; live telethon. One month later, the band participated at two Monmouth County Alliance of Neighbors concerts in Red Bank, NJ to raise funds for the families close the band&#x27;s hometowns, which were affected by the World Trade Center disaster. And on October 21, 2001, Bon Jovi performed at the monumental &quot;Concert For New York&quot; at Madison Square Garden, raising relief funds and honoring those who worked to save lives during the attack.

In spring 2002, the group entered the studio to begin recording their eighth studio album. &quot;Bounce&quot; was influenced by the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, released on October 8, 2002. The album debuted at number two in both the U.S. and UK, but was the first album to sell less than 6 million units since their 1985 record &quot;&quot;. The band went on the Bounce Tour for the album, during which they made history as the last band to play at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia before it was torn down.

Following the end of the Bounce Tour in August 2003, Bon Jovi embarked on a side project; originally intending to produce an album consisting of live acoustic performances, the band ended up rewriting, re-recording and reinventing 12 of their biggest hits in a new and much different light. Bon Jovi&#x27;s compilation album &quot;This Left Feels Right&quot; was released in November 2003.

The following year, the band released a box set titled &quot;100,000,000 Bon Jovi Fans Can&#x27;t Be Wrong&quot;, with the title and cover being a homage to Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can&#x27;t Be Wrong&quot;. The set consisted of four CDs packed with 38 unreleased and 12 rare tracks, as well as a DVD. The box set marked the sales of 100 million Bon Jovi albums and also commemorated the 20th anniversary of the release of the band&#x27;s first record in 1984. In November 2004, Bon Jovi was honored with the Award for Merit at the American Music Awards.

===&quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; and &quot;Lost Highway&quot; (2005–2008)===
The band&#x27;s ninth studio album, &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot;, was released in September 2005. The album debuted at number two in both the U.S. and UK, reaching number one in fifteen countries. The title track was an international hit, reaching the top ten in the UK, Europe, Australia and Canada. The second single, &quot;Who Says You Can&#x27;t Go Home&quot;, was released in early 2006. The song reached top forty on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S. A duet version of &quot;Who Says You Can&#x27;t Go Home&quot; with country singer Jennifer Nettles of the band Sugarland, peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs and Bon Jovi became the first rock band to have a number one single on Billboard&#x27;s Country Chart. On February 11, 2007, Bon Jovi and Jennifer Nettles won the Grammy Award, for &quot;Best Country Collaboration with Vocals&quot; for &quot;Who Says You Can&#x27;t Go Home&quot;. The band also won an award for Favorite Rock Song at the People&#x27;s Choice Awards with &quot;Who Says You Can&#x27;t Go Home&quot;.

Soon after the release of &quot;Have A Nice Day&quot;, the band started gearing up for the new 2005–2006 worldwide Have A Nice Day Tour. This tour, took the band to numerous stages and stadiums throughout the world. The tour was a significant commercial success, as the group played to 2,002,000 fans, and the tour grossed a total $191 million. The tour was the third-highest-grossing tour of 2006 taking in just over $131 million, just behind The Rolling Stones&#x27; A Bigger Bang World Tour and Madonna&#x27;s Confessions Tour. On November 14, 2006, Bon Jovi were inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame alongside James Brown and Led Zeppelin.
In June 2007, Bon Jovi released their tenth studio album, &quot;Lost Highway&quot;. The album influences the band&#x27;s rock sound with that of country music following the success of a country version of the band&#x27;s 2006 single &quot;Who Says You Can&#x27;t Go Home&quot;. To promote the new album, Bon Jovi made several television appearances, including the 6th annual CMT Awards in Nashville, &quot;American Idol&quot;, and MTV Unplugged, as well as playing at the Live Earth concert at Giants Stadium. They also performed ten promotional gigs in the U.S., Canada, the UK, and Japan. As part of the &#x27;tour&#x27;, Bon Jovi were the first group to perform at London&#x27;s new O2 Arena (formerly the Millennium Dome) when it opened to the public on June 24, 2007. The 23,000-seater stadium sold out within 30 minutes of tickets being released.

The album, described by Jon Bon Jovi as a &quot;Bon Jovi album influenced by Nashville&quot;, topped the charts in U.S., Canada, Europe, and Japan. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Till We Ain&#x27;t Strangers Anymore&quot;, features LeAnn Rimes and won the CMT Music Award for the Collaborative Video of the Year in 2008. The song was also nominated for the Academy of Country Music Award for Vocal Event of the Year.

In October 2007 the band announced the Lost Highway Tour. Starting with the 10 shows to open the brand new, Newark, New Jersey Prudential Center, the band toured Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, the U.S. and then Europe, finishing in the summer of 2008. The tour was the highest-grossing tour of 2008 in Billboard&#x27;s rankings, with ticket sales of $210.6 million, reported from November 14, 2007, through Nov.11, 2008. In all, 2,157,675 tickets were sold during 2008. Combined with $16.4 million in 2007 from the Newark shows, making a combined gross of $227 million in ticket sales. In Pollstar&#x27;s calculus for North America, the Lost Highway Tour had the highest gross for 2008 at $70.4 million.

===&quot;The Circle&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; (2009–2011)===

In April 2009, Phil Griffin&#x27;s documentary on the band, &quot;When We Were Beautiful&quot;, debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival, chronicling Bon Jovi&#x27;s ups and downs over 25 years and following the band on their latest Lost Highway tour.

In June 2009, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora were inducted into Songwriters Hall of Fame. That month they also recorded a cover of the song &quot;Stand By Me&quot; with Iranian singer Andy Madadian, to show solidarity for those affected by political unrest in Iran. Parts of the song were sung in Persian.

On November 10, 2009, the band released their eleventh studio album, titled &quot;The Circle&quot;. The Circle is a return to rock n&#x27; roll after their Nashville-influenced album, &quot;Lost Highway&quot;. The album debuted at number one in the U.S., Canada, Germany and Japan. Bon Jovi headed out on the road once again on February 19, 2010, embarking on The Circle Tour. Bon Jovi kicked off the stadium leg of the Circle Tour by making history. They played the first ever show at the brand new New Meadowlands Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The three sold-out shows on May 26, 27 and 29, 2010 were a huge success. Bon Jovi&#x27;s 12 night run at London&#x27;s O2 Arena grossed $18,178,036 and seen them play to 187,696 fans. The Circle Tour was the highest-grossing concert tour of 2010 according to Billboard&#x27;s annual Top 25 concert tours. So far the tour has played to 1,909,234 fans and has grossed $201.1 million from more than 80 venues reported to Pollstar. For the second time in three years, Bon Jovi ranked as Billboard&#x27;s &amp; Pollstar&#x27;s Top Touring Act of the Year. Bon Jovi was also ranked second on &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the world&#x27;s highest paid musicians, earning an approximate $125 million income that year.

Bon Jovi released a &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; with four new songs in October 2010. The album debuted at number one in Canada, Ireland, Europe, Australia and made the top five in twenty countries. At the 2010 MTV Europe Music Awards, Bon Jovi received the Global Icon Award. In October 2010, Bon Jovi released the concert film, &quot;The Circle Tour Live From Jersey&quot; in U.S. theaters. At the same time, the band announced their upcoming tour. At the conclusion of 2011, the tour placed second on Billboard&#x27;s annual, &quot;Top 25 Tour&quot;, earning more than £790 million dollars.

===&quot;Inside Out&quot;, &quot;What About Now&quot; and Sambora&#x27;s departure (2012–2014)===
In January 2012, Jon Bon Jovi stated that they were working on a twelfth studio album, and in a live show in August 2012, Jon Bon Jovi played an acoustic version of a song that was announced to be on the upcoming album. The album, &quot;What About Now&quot;, was released on March 12, 2013, and reached number one in the U.S., Canada, Austria, Sweden, and Australia. On February 13, Bon Jovi launched Because We Can, a new world tour for 2013 in support of &quot;What About Now&quot;, and visited North America, Europe, Africa, the Far East, Australia and Latin America.

On November 27, 2012, Bon Jovi released a new live video album, called &quot;Inside Out&quot;, made up of content from shows at the O2 Arena, MetLife Stadium, and Madison Square Garden. The album was first shown at movie theaters, with screenings preceded by a question-and-answer session with Jon Bon Jovi, Richie Sambora, David Bryan and Tico Torres streamed live from a theater in New York, and was subsequently made available for purchase on iTunes.

On March 14, 2013, Bon Jovi appeared on the results show of &quot;American Idol&quot; and played one song, &quot;Because We Can&quot;, from &quot;What About Now&quot;.
On April 2, 2013, Sambora departed the band&#x27;s ongoing tour for unspecified &quot;personal reasons&quot;; Session guitarist Phil X filled in after previously replacing him for several 2011 dates. This time he stayed on for the remainder of the tour, amidst rumors that Sambora had been fired. Both Sambora and Jon Bon Jovi later denied the claim. Torres was also sidelined briefly due to emergency gallbladder surgery; he was replaced by Rich Scannella from Bon Jovi&#x27;s solo band, the Kings of Suburbia, from September 20 to October 6.

In 2014, to celebrate the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary, the band&#x27;s album &quot;New Jersey&quot; was reissued with an additional CD with the &quot;Sons of Beaches&quot; demos on it.

In June 2014, Sambora told a reporter &quot;I love Jon and I certainly still foresee the possibility of a return. There is no bad blood with me now. I&#x27;m just taking the steps that I want, no, have to take.&quot; In November 2014, Jon Bon Jovi told a reporter that Sambora had officially left the band, saying &quot;He&#x27;s quit. He&#x27;s gone. No hard feelings.&quot; That November, he also revealed that he was finishing writing songs for the band&#x27;s next studio album, their first without Sambora, who was unofficially replaced by touring guitarist Phil X.

===&quot;Burning Bridges&quot; and &quot;This House Is Not for Sale&quot; (2015–2018)===
On July 31, 2015, Bon Jovi released twin lead singles &quot;We Don&#x27;t Run&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night Gave Me Sunday Morning&quot; for the compilation album &quot;Burning Bridges&quot;. &quot;Saturday Night Gave Me Sunday Morning&quot; had its premiere at the Austrian Radio Ö3 Hitradio on July 17, 2015, and &quot;We Don&#x27;t Run&quot; premiered at the Brazilian radio Radio Rock on July 20, 2015. &quot;Burning Bridges&quot; was released August 21, 2015. According to Bon Jovi, the album serves as a &quot;fan record&quot; to tie in with an accompanying international tour: &quot;It&#x27;s songs that weren&#x27;t finished, that were finished, a couple of new ones like the one we released as a single &#x27;We Don&#x27;t Run&#x27; &quot;.

A Bon Jovi consultant confirmed that a new studio album was planned to be released in 2016 followed by a world tour. On September 30, 2015, Jon Bon Jovi announced during a press conference that the title of their upcoming album will be &quot;This House Is Not for Sale&quot;. In the article, he said the following &quot;The record is about our integrity. Integrity matters and we&#x27;re at a place in our career where we don&#x27;t have anything left to prove.&quot;

The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;This House Is Not for Sale&quot;, featuring a music video, was released August 12, 2016, which also featured the promotion of unofficial members Hugh McDonald and Phil X to full-time band members. On November 4, 2016, the band officially released their 13th studio album, &quot;This House Is Not for Sale&quot;, which debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with 129,000 album-equivalent units, of which 128,000 were pure album sales. The album was followed by their third live album, &quot;This House Is Not for Sale – Live from the London Palladium&quot;, released on December 16, 2016.
In November 2016, Island Records and Universal Music Enterprises released Bon Jovi&#x27;s studio albums in remastered versions on vinyl, spanning their 32-year career from &quot;Bon Jovi&quot; (1984) up until &quot;What About Now&quot; (2013). On February 10, 2017, a 25-LP box set titled &quot;Bon Jovi: The Albums&quot; was released. It consists of Bon Jovi&#x27;s 13 studio albums, the compilation &quot;Burning Bridges&quot; (2015), the two Jon Bon Jovi solo albums (&quot;Blaze of Glory&quot; and &quot;Destination Anywhere&quot;), and an exclusive &quot;Extras&quot; album featuring &quot;international rarities&quot;.

On December 13, 2017, it was announced that Bon Jovi would be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018, after winning the 2017 fan ballot with over 1.1 million votes. Jon Bon Jovi invited Sambora and Such to appear with the band at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony. In later February 2018, it was confirmed that Such and Sambora would perform with the band at the 2018 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony.
On April 29, 2018, the band performed at the BMO Harris Bradley Center, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as the last ticketed event at the venue before the start of demolition in the summer of 2018.

===&quot;2020&quot;, the death of Alec John Such and rumors of Sambora&#x27;s return (2019–2023)===
On March 9, 2019, Jon Bon Jovi announced via social media that the band is back in the studio recording its fifteenth studio album, which was to be released in early 2020. In August 2019, he announced that the album would be called &quot;2020&quot;. The release date was scheduled for May 15, 2020, but Jovi announced in an interview with Howard Stern that the album and its accompanying tour, Bon Jovi 2020 Tour, had been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 20, 2020, Bon Jovi announced that the Bon Jovi 2020 Tour had been canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The album ended up being released in October. On January 7, 2022, the band announced a tour in April. Critics and social media users discussed the quality of Jon Bon Jovi&#x27;s vocal performances during the tour, with many believing that it was poor.

During the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, a viral video appeared where residents in Odesa, Ukraine, prepared for a Russian attack while a drummer played to the Bon Jovi hit &quot;It&#x27;s My Life&quot;. Bon Jovi supported this video and shared it with their followers, with the comment &quot;This is for the ones who stood their ground... Odessa, Ukraine. #SlavaUkraini&quot;.

The death of founding member Alec John Such was announced by the band on June 5, 2022. It was later revealed that he had died of a heart attack.

In February 2023, former guitarist Richie Sambora noted that he was in talks about potentially rejoining the band: &quot;We&#x27;re talking about it. I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any reason not to [return] at this point. I mean, [Jon and I] we did something... there&#x27;s not a lot of bands that did what we did. [...] We have to get out there and do it for the fans really.&quot; However, in May 2024, Bon Jovi confirmed that there were no plans for Sambora to rejoin and that a reunion was unlikely.

===&quot;Thank You, Goodnight&quot; and &quot;Forever&quot; (2024–present)===
In October 2023, guitarist Phil X revealed in an interview that the band was heading to Nashville for a month to record a brand new album. On November 17, 2023, the band released a holiday themed single called &quot;Christmas Isn&#x27;t Christmas&quot;. This was the band&#x27;s first release since the 2020 album and a preparation towards the new album coming out in 2024. On March 14, 2024, the band released the single, &quot;Legendary&quot;, the lead single from their 16th album, &quot;Forever&quot;, released on June 7, 2024. The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Living Proof&quot;, was released May 17.

In April 2024, a four-part documentary series on the band, &quot;Thank You, Goodnight: The Bon Jovi Story&quot;, premiered on Hulu and Disney+. Directed by Gotham Chopra, the series chronicles the band&#x27;s entire history, with interviews with the members of the band along with those who worked with them while following the current line-up of the band on its 2022 tour as they &quot;chart out their future&quot;.

==Musical style==
Bon Jovi&#x27;s musical style has generally been characterized as hard rock, arena rock and pop rock. The band&#x27;s first four albums were described as glam metal. Their first two albums used a heavier mixture of glam metal and hard rock while their follow ups, &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; and &quot;New Jersey,&quot; featured a more commercialized mixture of glam metal and hard rock. They shed the glam metal sound by their fifth studio album, &quot;Keep the Faith&quot;, and their sixth, &quot;These Days&quot;, utilizing a more mature hard rock sound. &quot;Crush&quot; was characterized as &quot;far enough into pop/rock to actually stand a chance of getting airplay&quot;, while &quot;Bounce&quot; was described as &quot;heavy, serious rock&quot;. &quot;Have a Nice Day&quot; was also characterized as being heavier than &quot;Crush&quot;. The band altered their sound dramatically in their next release, &quot;Lost Highway&quot;, blending influences from country music and country rock, a sound Jon Bon Jovi described as &quot;a Bon Jovi album influenced by Nashville.” Bon Jovi returned to a more typical rock sound on &quot;The Circle&quot;, which was described by Allmusic as &quot;conjured by echoed, delayed guitars, shimmering keyboards, and spacious rhythms.&quot;

<text>Veracruz, formally Veracruz de Ignacio de la Llave, officially the Free and Sovereign State of Veracruz de Ignacio de la Llave, is one of the 31 states which, along with Mexico City, comprise the 32 Federal Entities of Mexico. Located in eastern Mexico, Veracruz is bordered by seven states, which are Tamaulipas, San Luis Potosí, Hidalgo, Puebla, Oaxaca, Chiapas, and Tabasco. Veracruz is divided into 212 municipalities, and its capital city is Xalapa-Enríquez.

Veracruz has a significant share of the coastline of the Gulf of Mexico on the east of the state. The state is noted for its mixed ethnic and indigenous populations. Its cuisine reflects the many cultural influences that have come through the state because of the importance of the port of Veracruz. In addition to the capital city, the state&#x27;s largest cities include Veracruz, Coatzacoalcos, Córdoba, Minatitlán, Poza Rica, Boca Del Río and Orizaba.

==Etymology==
The full name of the state is Veracruz de Ignacio de la Llave. Veracruz was named after the city of Veracruz (From Latin &quot;Vera Crux&quot;, &quot;True Cross&quot;), which was originally called the Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz. The suffix is in honor of Ignacio de la Llave y Segura Zevallos (1818–1863), who was the governor of Veracruz from 1861 to 1862. The state&#x27;s seal was authorized by the state legislature in 1954, adapting the one used for the port of Veracruz and created by the Spanish in the early colonial days of the 16th century.

==History==
===Pre-Columbian===
The history of the native peoples of the state of Veracruz is complex. In the pre-Columbian period, the modern-day state of Veracruz was inhabited primarily by four indigenous cultures. The Huastecs and Otomis occupied the north, while the Totonacs resided in the north-center. The Olmecs, one of the oldest cultures in the Americas, became dominant in the southern part of Veracruz. Remains of these past civilizations can be found in archeological sites such as Pánuco, Castillo de Teayo, El Zapotal, Las Higueras, Quiahuiztlán, El Tajín, Cempoala, Tres Zapotes and San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán.

The first major civilization in the territory of the current state was that of the Olmecs. The Olmecs lived in the Coatzacoalcos River region and it became the center of Olmec culture. The main ceremonial center here was San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán. Other major centers in the state include Tres Zapotes in the city of Veracruz and La Venta in Tabasco. The culture reached its height about 2600 years ago, with its best-known artistic expression being the colossal stone heads. These ceremonial sites were the most complex of that early time period. For this reason, many anthropologists consider the Olmec civilization to be the mother culture of the many Mesoamerican cultures that followed it. By 300 BCE, this culture was eclipsed by other emerging civilizations in Mesoamerica.

Another major group was the Totonacs, who have survived to the present day. Their region, called Totonacapan, is centered between the Cazones River and the Papaloapan River in the north of the state. Pre-Columbian Totonacs lived from hunting, fishing and agriculture, mostly of corn, beans, chili peppers and squash. This is also the native region of the vanilla bean. Clay sculptures with smiling faces are indicative of this culture. The major site is El Tajín, located near Papantla, but the culture reached its apogee in Cempoala (about inland from the current port of Veracruz), when it was conquered by the Aztecs. When the Spaniards arrived in 1519, the territory was still home to a population of about 250,000 people living in fifty population centers and speaking four Totonac dialects. 25,000 were living in Cempoala alone.

The Huastecs are in the far north of the Veracruz and extend into parts of Tamaulipas, Hidalgo, San Luis Potosí, Querétaro and Puebla. The language and agricultural techniques of these people and the Maya are similar; however, only a few buildings and ceramics remain from the early Huastec culture. This culture also reached its peak between 1200 and 1519, when it was conquered by the Spanish.

During the 15th and very early 16th century, the Aztecs came to dominate much of the state and dividing it into tributary provinces, of Tochtepec, Cuetlaxtlan, Cempoallan, Quauhtochco, Jalapa, Misantla, and Tlatlauhquitepec. The Aztecs were interested in the area&#x27;s vegetation and crops such as cedars, fruit, cotton, cacao, corn, beans and vanilla. However, the Totonacs chafed under Aztec rule, with Aztec rulers from Axayacatl to Moctezuma II having to send soldiers to quell rebellions. The Huastecs were subjugated more successfully by the Aztecs and relegated to the provinces of Atlan and Tochpan.

===Colonial period, 1519–1821===

Veracruz played an important part in the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire by Hernán Cortés and his expedition members. They founded Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz on May 18, 1519, as the first Spanish town in what is now Mexico. By doing so, Cortés threw off the authority of the Governor of Cuba, Diego Velázquez, claiming authority directly from the Spanish crown. A small contingent of the expedition remained at Veracruz, while the main body of conquerors moved inland.

The Totonacs were some of the first people with whom the Spanish had contact on the American mainland. The very first contact was with Captain Juan de Grijalva on the coastline north of the present-day city of Veracruz. Still chafing under Aztec rule, Totonac ruler Tlacochcalcatl welcomed Hernán Cortés and promised 50,000 warriors to help defeat Tenochtitlan. The Spanish helped the Totonacs expel Aztec tribute collectors and seize control of some Aztec outposts. The Spanish founded the port city of Veracruz on the coast, as the first municipality under the direct control of the king of Spain. Cortés then began his march inland to Tenochtitlan. During the Conquest, the rest of the Totonac peoples allied themselves with the Spanish, but the Huastecs, despite also being under Aztec rule, fought against them. After the fall of Tenochtitlan, Cortés sent a regiment to subdue the Huastecs.

During the early conquest era, Cortés distributed the labor of indigenous settlements to particular conquerors in an institution known as &quot;encomienda&quot;. The indigenous ruler of the settlement was charged with mobilization labor and tribute that was due to the holder of the &quot;encomienda&quot;. Veracruz had a number of encomiendas that changed hands a number of times, but early on came under the direct control of the Spanish crown rather than individual &quot;encomenderos&quot;.

During the colonial era, Veracruz was the main port of entry for immigrants from Spain, African slaves, and all types of luxury goods for import and export. The first group of Franciscans arrived in Veracruz in 1524, walking barefoot to the capital of the Spanish colony of New Spain. The route between Veracruz and the Spanish capital of Mexico City, built on the site of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlan, was the key trade route during the colonial era. Much of the history of the state is involved with the port city that Cortés founded in 1519. Veracruz became the principal and often only port to export and import goods between the colony of New Spain and Spain itself. To ensure the port&#x27;s monopoly, it came to have control over almost all of New Spain&#x27;s Gulf coastline. New Spain&#x27;s silver and cochineal red dye, were the two most important exports from the port, along with chocolate, vanilla, chili peppers, and much more were exported. Imported were livestock (sheep, cows, goats, horses), wheat and other cultivars. From the Caribbean, slaves, pineapple, and sugar cane were introduced. This made the port a highly prized target for pirates during the colonial period, with attacks and sackings frequent. This led to the building of the fort of San Juan de Ulúa, a site Juan de Grijalva visited in 1518, and the fortification of the city overall.

Much of Totonac and Huastec culture have survived the colonial period into the present day. Much of the reason for this is that the north of Veracruz is rugged with thick vegetation and relatively little of the resources the Spanish were looking for. Veracruz is considered to be where the &quot;mestizo&quot; or mixed European/indigenous ethnicities began, which is a large part of Mexican cultural identity.

Arriving with the Spanish conquerors, new diseases made their first appearance in the continent. European diseases decimated the native population of the province, prompting the importation of African slaves during the colonial period, starting in the 16th century. The Spanish imported between 500,000 and 1,000,000 West African slaves into Mexico between 1535 and 1767 (miscegenation between indigenous and African populations began almost immediately). New Spain did not have any laws prohibiting interracial marriage, hence the correct term is Afro-Mestizo, which includes all 3 ethnicities: Indigenous, African, and Spanish.

Runaway slaves (&quot;cimarrones&quot;) became problematic to public order since they frequently formed robber bands that attacked travelers on highways. Crown efforts against these groups began in earnest in the late sixteenth century, but a major rebellion broke out in 1606 in the areas of Villa Rica, Nueva Veracruz, Antón Lizardo, and the Rio Blanco area. However, the gravest of these occurred in the Orizaba area, where there were about 500 fugitive slaves. In 1609, a leader named Gaspar Yanga led an insurrection against the Spanish but was defeated in battle. Unrest continued, eventually forcing the government to sign an amnesty pact and giving the Africans the right to form their own community, exacting as a condition that bandits be suppressed. This was called San Lorenzo de Zerral but today it is known as the municipality of Yanga. This was the first time slavery was abolished in the Americas.

In the first half of the seventeenth century, cities such as Córdoba, Orizaba, and Xalapa were formed or expanded to protect the trade route between Mexico City and the port of Veracruz. During this time, the Spanish and mixed-ethnicities population increased as the purely indigenous population continued to fall to a fraction of pre-Conquest levels (due now to mixing, rather than disease). Almost all trade in and out of New Spain had to be with Spain except for some limited trade authorized with England and other Spanish colonies. This would stay in place until 1778, when &quot;the Decreto de Libre Comercio&quot;, allowing a limited free trade within Spanish-held realms, lifted many of these restrictions on trade with Europe. This would make the port more important than it had been, and led to increased prosperity for the inhabitants.

Outside of the port, in other areas of the province, the economy was based on agriculture, livestock, and commerce. In 1720, Xalapa organized the first trade fair, making it the center for trade between inland Mexican goods and those from abroad. This would lead to its eventual status as the capital of the state.

In 1746, the state was divided into the civil jurisdictions of Pánuco, Tampico, Huayacocotla, Huauchinango, Papantla, Misantla, Xalapa, Jalacingo, Veracruz, Córdoba, Orizaba, Cosamaloapan, Tuxtla, and Cotaxtla.

The port city of Veracruz, and the fort of San Juan de Ulúa, where Cortés landed three hundred years earlier, was where the loyalist soldiers of the Spanish Crown made their last stand against the independence movement in 1824.

===Independence===
During the Mexican War of Independence, there was support for the insurgents in many parts of the state, with skirmishes erupting in various parts as early as 1811. A major conspiracy against the colonial government was discovered in the port in 1812, with rebels taking Ayahualulco and Ixhuacán during the same year. This forced royalist troops to withdraw to Xalapa. Eventually, this city along with the port were cut off from Mexico City. Most of the state remained in rebel hands during the rest of the war although the commercial class of the port did not support the effort. In 1821, Juan de O&#x27;Donojú, the last viceroy of New Spain, came to the port to leave for Spain. However, until 1823, Spanish troops continued to occupy San Juan de Ulúa Fort. In 1826, the city would receive the first of its four titles of &quot;heroic city&quot; for confronting these remaining Spanish troops.

While the last of the Spanish held on in San Juan de Ulúa, Agustín de Iturbide had been declared the emperor of Mexico in 1822. However, his reign quickly encountered resistance from those favoring a republican form of government, including from Antonio López de Santa Anna from his stronghold in Veracruz state. Months later, Iturbide would go into exile and Santa Anna would eventually hold nine terms as president.

The French intervened in Mexico through Veracruz for the first time in the 1838, in what became the Pastry War. The port was blockaded. Efforts to defend the country were coordinated from Xalapa. The port was bombarded, but eventually a settlement was reached.

During the Mexican–American War, the port was blockaded again, this time by the Americans. Initial American attempts in 1847 to land in Alvarado were checked, but the Americans then made a plan to land a few miles south of Veracruz, which surrendered after a 20-day siege, defeated General Santa Anna&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Cerro Gordo, and marched inland through Xalapa towards Mexico City, led by General Winfield Scott. Mexico surrendered shortly after.

The municipalities of Tuxpan and Chicontepec belonged to Puebla until 1853, when they were annexed to Veracruz to give the state its final form. In 1855, the State Government Palace was constructed. During the Reform War, the major player was Ignacio de la Llave whose name is part of the state&#x27;s official designation. In 1858, the port became the site for the liberal government under Benito Juárez after he was forced out of Mexico City during the Reform War. Their control of this port and its customs duties allowed liberal forces to gather resources. Conservative forces attacked the state but were repelled from both the port and Xalapa.

The Reform War wrecked Mexico&#x27;s economy and it found itself unable to pay debts it owed to Europe. As a result, Juárez cancelled Mexico&#x27;s foreign debt. Spain, Britain and France, all outraged by this action, decided in October 1861 to force repayment of their loans by the occupation of the Mexican Gulf Coast. Normally, this move would have been blocked by the United States under the Monroe Doctrine, however, that nation was occupied with a Civil War at the time, and the European powers believed that the Americans could not act. In December, Spanish troops commanded by general Manuel Gasset occupied the port of Veracruz, without any local resistance, followed a month later by French and British forces. The Spanish and the British withdrew after making deals with Juárez, but the French pushed on to establish the reign of Maximilian I of Mexico. However, this was short-lived and the French were expelled through Veracruz in 1866/67.

In 1863, the state was officially named Veracruz-Llave. After the French were expelled, the state government was in the port of Veracruz. In 1878, the capital was transferred to Orizaba. It was later moved to Xalapa in 1885.

By the end of the century, many infrastructure improvements, such as roads and railways (especially the Ferrocarril Interoceánico) had been completed with the major cities being Veracruz, Orizaba, Xalapa, Córdoba, Jalacingo, Chicontepec and Tantoyuca. The discovery of oil in the north of the state attracted foreign firms, which brought machinery needed for its extraction. These companies included Huasteca Company Petroleum and El Aguila along with American and English firms. During the same time period, uprisings against the government under Porfirio Díaz in the agricultural south of the state were brutally repressed.

===20th century to the present===
Unrest against the Díaz regime continued until the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution ousted him from power. The major event leading up to this war in Veracruz was the cigar-makers strike of 1905, when more than 5,000 workers of the &quot;El Valle Nacional&quot; company walked off the job. The governor, Teodora A. Dehesa, unsuccessfully tried to negotiate a settlement. The strike went on for months until the strikers won. This victory encouraged more actions, until strikes at the factories in Rio Blanco, Nogales, Santa Rosa and Contón de Orizaba resulted in dramatic violence in January 1907.
No major battles of the Mexican Revolution were fought in the state, though there were skirmishes and attacks on the port. By 1914 rebel Cándido Agular occupied a number of municipalities in the state and in 1917, Venustiano Carranza transferred the federal government here temporarily.

On April 21, 1914, an incident involving U.S. sailors in Tampico led President Woodrow Wilson to land American troops in Veracruz, where they remained for six months. Mexico later responded by severing diplomatic relations.

After the Revolution, agrarian reform, including the redistribution of land and the creation of ejidos took place here. The oil companies in the north of the state were nationalized and consolidated into PEMEX in the 1930s by Lázaro Cárdenas. In the 1950s, more road construction, such as the Mexico City- Poza Rica, Veracruz-Alvarado- Coatzacoalco and Tinajas-Ciudad Aleman-Tlacoatalpan highways were constructed. The Universidad Veracruzana was expanded as well. In 1960, the Xalapa Museum of Anthropology was inaugurated as well as the Coatzacoalco-Salina Cruz highway. The Veracruz city international airport was opened in the 1970s.

In the ten years after 2006, at least 3,600 people have disappeared within the state. Multiple mass graves have been found within the state. This is seen as part of the over 28,000 missing individuals related to the Mexican Drug War. Within the state the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas have battled for control. Additionally, this has led to journalists being targeted and killed within the state.

==Geography==
===Political geography===
The state is a crescent-shaped strip of land wedged between the Sierra Madre Oriental to the west and the Gulf of Mexico to the east. Its total area is , accounting for about 3.7% of Mexico&#x27;s total territory. It stretches about north to south, but its width varies from between , with an average of about in width. Veracruz shares common borders with the states of Tamaulipas (to the north), Oaxaca and Chiapas (to the south), Tabasco (to the southeast), and Puebla, Hidalgo, and San Luis Potosí (on the west). Veracruz has of coastline with the Gulf of Mexico.

===Natural geography===

The natural geography can be categorized into nine regions: The Sierra de Zongolica, the Tecolutla Region, the Huayacocotla Region, the Metlac River area, the Tuxtlas Region, the Central Region, the Laguna del Castillo Region, the Pueblo Viejo-Tamiahua Region and the Laguna de Alvarado Region. The topography changes drastically, rising from the narrow coastal plains to the highlands of the eastern Sierra Madre. Elevation varies from sea level to the Pico de Orizaba, Mexico&#x27;s highest peak at above sea level. The coast consists of low sandy strips interspersed with tidewater streams and lagoons. Most of the long coastline is narrow and sandy with unstable dunes, small shifting lagoons, and points.

The mountains are of the Sierra Madre Oriental and the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. Mountain ranges include the Sierra de Topila, Sierra de Otontepec, Sierra de Huayacocotla, Sierra de Coxquihui, Sierra de Chiconquiaco, Sierra de Jalacingo, Sierra de Axocuapan, Sierra de Huatusco, Sierra de Zongolica, and the Sierra de Los Tuxtlas. Major peaks include Pico de Orizaba (), Cofre de Perote (), Cerro de Tecomates (), Cerro del Vigía Alta () and Cerro de 3 Tortas (). The Pico de Orizaba is covered in snow year round; the Cofre de Perote is covered in winter. Major valleys include the Acultzingo, Córdoba, Maltrata, Orizaba and San Andrés.

More than 40 rivers and tributaries provide water for irrigation and hydroelectric power; they also carry rich silt down from the eroding highlands, which is deposited in the valleys and coastal areas. All of the rivers and streams that cross the state begin in the Sierra Madre Oriental or in the Central Mesa, flowing east to the Gulf of Mexico. The important ones include: Actopan River, Acuatempan river, Río Blanco, Cazones River, Coatzacoalcos River, Río de La Antigua, Ayyappan River, Jamapa River, Nautla River, Pánuco River, Papaloapan River, Tecolutla River, Tonalá River, Tuxpan River and Xoloapa River. The largest in terms of water discharge are the Pánuco, Tuxpan, Papaloapan, Coazocoalcos and Uxpanapa. The Panuco, Tuxpan, Papaloapan and Coatzacoalcos are navigable. Two of Mexico&#x27;s most polluted rivers, the Coatzacoalcos and the Río Blanco are located in the state. Much of the pollution comes from industrial sources, but the discharge of sewerage and uncontrolled garbage disposal are also major contributors. The state has very few sewage treatment plants, with only 10% of sewage being treated before discharge.

The state also has ten major waterfalls and ten major coastal lagoons. There is only one significant lake, called Lake Catemaco. Off the coast are the islands of Isla de Lobos, Isla de los Burros, Isla de Sacrificios, Isla de Salmendina, Isla del Idolo, Isladel Toro, Isla Frijoles, Isla Juan A Ramirez, Isla Pajaros and Isla Terrón and the ocean reefs called Blanquilla, Medio, Tangüillo, Tuxpan, Gualleguilla, Gallega, Anegada de Adento Anegada de Afuera and Cabezo.

===Climate===

The large variation of altitude results in a large mixture of climates, from cold, snow-topped mountain peaks to hot, humid tropical areas on the coast. 32% of the state is classified as hot and humid, 52% as hot and semi humid, 9% is warm and humid, 6% as temperate and humid and 1% is classified as cold. Hot and humid and hot and semi-humid climates dominate from sea level to about above sea level. Average annual temperature ranges from with precipitation varying from to just over per year. Cooler and humid climates are found at elevations between . These have an average temperature of between with precipitation varying between . Temperate climates are found at higher altitudes, between . Temperatures here vary from with precipitation varying more, between . Cold climates are found at the highest elevations, reaching up to the Cofre de Perote and the Pico de Orizaba. There is a small semiarid region around the city of Perote and the west of the Huasteca area. This is due to a rain shadow caused by the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt and the Sierra Madre Oriental, which do not permit the flow of moist Gulf air to this region.

===Ecosystems===

Various types of forest cover the state, but evergreen tropical forest dominate. The state&#x27;s ecology is of great importance for many plant and animal species. It is a center of plant endemism and has two separate endemic bird areas.

The northern part of the state as well as the higher mountain areas, are convergence zones between lowland evergreen tropical forests and more temperate flora and fauna. It is also the northernmost occurrence of subhumid tropical forest in Mexico, although little of this remains, mostly on steep slopes. The tropical forests of the Veracruz moist forests ecoregion are situated in the northeastern coastal plain and extend into southern Tamaulipas state, on the east side of the Sierra Madre Oriental. The soils here are volcanic and shallow, but with rich organic matter. Species that predominate include Mayan breadnut (&quot;Brosimum alicastrum&quot;), sapodilla (&quot;Manilkara zapota&quot;), rosadillo (&quot;Celtis monoica&quot;), &quot;Bursera simaruba&quot;, &quot;Dendropanax arboreus&quot;, and &quot;Sideroxylon capiri&quot;. This ecoregion extends into the central part of the state, with vegetation changing to include mahogany (&quot;Swietenia macrophylla&quot;), sapodilla (&quot;Manilkara zapota&quot;), &quot;Bernoullia flammea&quot;, and &quot;Astronium graveolens&quot;. In the central part of the state, the Veracruz dry forests extend from the Sierra to the coast, south of the Sierra de Chiconquiaco. The Petén–Veracruz moist forests occupy the southern part of the state, and extend eastwards through neighboring Chiapas and Tabasco states into Guatemala.

Veracruz has been described as having one of the richest varieties of wildlife in the western hemisphere. There is an especially diverse array of endemic insects like the conspicuous &quot;Arsenura armida&quot;. As well as insects, the state is known for its many arachnids, and features over 25 species of tarantula (Theraphosidae), of which many are endemic. The state is part of Birdlife International&#x27;s Endemic Bird Area(EBA) project due to the number of endemic birds here. Some of these include green-cheeked amazon (&quot;Amazona viridigenalis&quot;), Tamaulipas crow (&quot;Corvus imparatus&quot;), Altamira yellowthroat (&quot;Geothlypis flavovelata&quot;) and crimson-collared grosbeak (&quot;Rhodothraupis celaeno&quot;). Despite much of the deterioration of the forest areas, it is still an important stopover for migratory birds as well. Many endangered mammal species can be found here including two endemic rodents (&quot;Peromyscus ochraventer&quot; and &quot;Neotoma angustapalata&quot;), the jaguar (&quot;Panthera onca&quot;), ocelot (&quot;Leopardus pardalis&quot;), jaguarundi (&quot;Herpailurus yaguarondi&quot;) and white-nosed coati (&quot;Nasua narica&quot;). The endangered Baird&#x27;s tapir may occasionally be spotted in the state&#x27;s southern jungle regions, such as Biósfera Los Tuxtlas. This region is also the northernmost extent of the primate &quot;Alouatta palliata&quot;, or mantled howler.

Most of Veracruz&#x27;s native forests have been destroyed and replaced by scrub and secondary communities of trees. From 1900 to 1987, over of forest had been logged, resulting in the loss of habitat and biodiversity. Much of the logging is due to commercial timber, search for tropical hardwoods and the clearing of land for local farmers, especially for cattle grazing. Only 20% of Veracruz&#x27;s original ecosystem remains, with 64% transformed by human exploitation. Despite some efforts at conservation and reclamation, exploitation continues to put pressure on remaining wild areas.

The state has 31 environmentally protected areas in 21 different municipalities. Nine are urban parks, three are national parks (Pico de Orizaba, Cofre de Perote and San José de los Molinos). The Cofre de Perote National Park is 11,700 hectares of pine and oyamel forest, which was created in 1937. The Los Tuxtlas Biosphere Reserve covers the municipalities of Ángel R. Cabada, Santiago Tuxtla, San Andres Tuxtla, Catemaco, Soteapan, Mecayapan, Pajapan and Tatahuicapan for a total of . It contains various volcanos such as San Martín and Santa Marta and rich biodiversity as it stretches from sea level to higher elevations, with 16 climate regions groups into four climate types. Forest types range from evergreen tropical rainforest to pine. 75% of species here are also found in Central America and there is a total of 2,368 plant species. Some, such as &quot;Costus dirzoi, Daphnopsis megacarpa, Eugenia sotoesparzae, Inga sinacae, Miconia ibarrae, Mormodes tuxtlensis&quot;, and &quot;Thelypteris rachyflexuosa&quot;, are native only to this area. Wildlife includes 102 mammal species, 49 amphibian, 109 reptilian, 561 bird species and more. Species in danger of extinction include the jaguar, spider monkey and anteater.

The Veracruz Reef System is also considered to be a national park and is mostly off the coast of Veracruz city, Boca del Río and Alvarado. The area includes coral reefs, seaweed beds and other marine vegetation, covering an area of . There are seventeen reefs in total, some of which jut above the surface to form small islands. This system links with the reef systems of Campeche and Yucatán.

==Economy==
Veracruz has one of Mexico&#x27;s leading economies, based on agriculture and petroleum. Using relatively recent night light data and electricity consumption in comparison with Gross County Product, the informal sector of the local economy in Veracruz state is shown to have grown during the period of the Fox Administration though the regional government remained PRI. The assumption that the informal economy of Mexico is a constant 30% of total economic activity is not supported at the local level. The small amount of local spatial autocorrelation that was found suggests a few clusters of high and low literacy rates amongst municipios in Veracruz but not enough to warrant including an I-statistic as a regressor. Global spatial autocorrelation is found especially literacy at the macro-regional level which is an area for further research beyond this study. Improved literacy bolsters both the informal and formal economies in Veracruz indicating policies designed to further literacy are vital for growing the regional economy. While indigenous people are relatively poor, little evidence was found that the informal economy is a higher percentage of total economic activity in a municipio with a high share of indigenous people. While the formal economy might have been expanding relative to the informal economy in 2000, by 2006 this process had been reversed with growing informality. While rural municipios have smaller economies, they are not different from urban municipios in the share of the economy that is informal. Programs in the past that might move economic activity from the informal to the formal sector have not succeeded suggesting public finance issues such as tax evasion will continue to plague the state with low government revenues.

===Agriculture===
The primary sector of the economy (agriculture, forestry and fishing) has been important since pre-Hispanic times and continues to be important both as a source of income as well as culturally. The state has abundant rainfall and extremely fertile soils, as well as a long coastline and forest containing a wide variety of trees and other plants.

There is about 1 million hectares of cultivable land, half of which is in private hands and 43% is ejido or communal land. The rest is occupied by human settlements. There are 3,620 ejidos parceled out to 270,000 ejido members. 52.5% of agricultural land is used for the growing of crops or used as pasture and 43.1% is forest or rainforest. Chief agricultural products include coffee, vanilla, sugarcane, tobacco, bananas, coconuts, and vegetables, but local farmers depend mainly on corn and beans. Two corn crops per year are generally produced, planted on 644,936 hectares with a production of 1,114,325 tons. The state is the leading national producer of coffee, sugarcane, corn, and rice. Coffee is grown on 152,993 hectares producing 400,575 tons. Export earnings from this crop are about US$232 million annually. Most coffee is grown in the mountain areas of Córdoba-Huatusco, Coatepec-Teocelo-Cosautlán and Misantla-Tlapacoyan-Atzalan. Sugarcane is cultivated on 254,000 hectares, producing 16,867,958 tons annually. Veracruz is the largest producer of rice with 24,000 hectares producing 120,000 tons. Much is this crop is protected by import bans from Asia. 

The state grows half of the country&#x27;s citrus fruit and grows the most kinds. This occupies 180,577 hectares and produces 2,575,140 tons annually. Varieties include oranges, tangerines, mandarins, limes and grapefruit. Most citrus is grown in the north of the state, and much of the lime crop is exported, supporting a packing and shipping industry. Veracruz is the largest mango producer in the country, grown on 31,640 hectares producing 287,000 tons. Most of this is the manila variety, which is preferred in Mexico. 95% of this crop is consumed fresh within Mexico although exports to Canada have begun. Vanilla beans are native to the state, which is the primary producer for Mexico. Most of this crop is grown in an area known as Totonacapan in and around Papantla.

Livestock raising is an important activity. There are over 300,000 units of production most of which raise cattle, with Veracruz being the main beef producer for the country at 14% of the total. In addition to beef cattle, dairy cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, horses, domestic fowl, and bees are raised.

From the tropical forests of the inland regions come dyewoods, hardwoods, and rubber. About 20% of the state&#x27;s territory is forested, with 220,000 of temperate forest and 1,200,000 hectares of tropical forests. Logging in the state produces 128,254 m3 of wood products per year. The most exploited species include pine, oyamel, cypress and oak. Some tropical hardwoods are harvested as well.

Veracruz&#x27;s long coastline supports a large fishing industry, producing one-fifth of Mexico&#x27;s catch. Most of the country&#x27;s mojarra, oysters and shrimp come from here. Other major fish catches include crab, sea bass and red snapper.

Agroindustry focuses on the processing of coffee and sugar products, with citrus packers holding an important position as well. 

===Natural resources===
Today, the state of Veracruz, rich in natural resources, is an important component of Mexico&#x27;s economy. Approximately 35% of Mexico&#x27;s water supply is found in Veracruz. There are a number of metallic and non-metallic mineral mining but the most important resource is oil.

The mountains contain relatively unexploited deposits of gold, silver, iron, and coal. Although Veracruz is an important source of metals such as iron and copper, a great deal of its mining involves non-metallic minerals as sulfur, silica, feldspar, calcium, kaolin and marble. The state is ranked fourth in the nation for this kind of mining production. However, mining only accounts for 1.5% of economic activity for the entire state.

Veracruz was a pioneer in both the extraction and refining of petroleum products. The state has about one-fourth of Mexico&#x27;s petroleum reserves and ranks third in petroleum production. Most of this production is concentrated in the northern part of the state. Approximately of oil are produced each year and of natural gas. Petrochemicals represent 28.1% of the state&#x27;s manufacturing and ranks first nationally. There are 22 petrochemical plants, with the most important being La Cangrejera, Jáltipan de Morelos, Poza Rica, Cosoleacaque, Pajaritos and Minatitlán.

===Golden Lane Oil Fields===
The &quot;Golden Lane&quot; (&quot;Dos Bocas-Alamo structure&quot; or The Ridge&quot;) refers to a series of oil fields aligned in an arc onshore and a symmetrical alignment offshore, forming two sides of a Cretaceous atoll 180 km long. The structure was discovered in 1908 by Weetman Pearson&#x27;s Mexican Eagle Petroleum Company San diego de la Mar No. 1 well, which flowed 2,500 bbl/day. The Golden Lane oil fields penetrate a massive elliptical reef platform, identified as the Sierra del Abra limestone (consisting of reef, backreef and lagoonal facies), which dips southeast. The site for the discovery well was selected due to the presence of petroleum seeps, just as was Edward Laurence Doheny&#x27;s La Paz No. well in the Ebano-Panuco petroleum district west of Tampico, Tamaulipas, the first Mexican discovery well in 1904. In 1908, the infamous Dos Bocas oil fire occurred after the San Diego de la Mar No. 3 blowout. This was followed by the Potrero del Llano No. 4 well, flowing 100,000 bbl per day during the three months it was out of control. Doheny&#x27;s Cerro Azul No. 4 well, located by Ezequiel Ordonez, became the largest daily production record holder in 1916 at 260,000 bbl. Geophysical studies, in particular gravimetry, starting in 1920 led to the discovery of the Poza Rica Field in 1932 and Moralillo Field in 1948, on the west flank of the Golden Lane in the Tamabra forereef facies. Refraction seismography surveys started in 1930, augemented in 1948 with reflection seismography, which led to the discovery of the southern extent of the atoll with the Ezequiel Ordonez No. 1 well in 1952 and additional discoveries through 1968. Marine seismic and magnetometer surveys starting in 1957 showed the extent of the atoll offshore and led to the first offshore well, Isla de Lobos No. 1-B, in 1963. The depths of wells are on the order of 500 m onshore and 2000 m offshore.

===Industry, transportation and commerce===
Laguna Verde Nuclear Power Plant (LVNPP) in Alto Lucero, Veracruz, produces about 4.5% of Mexico&#x27;s electrical energy.

The manufacturing industry in Veracruz accounts for between 21% and one-third of the state&#x27;s gross domestic product, and approximately 64% of the manufacturing industry GDP is generated by the chemical and petrochemical sectors. Other products produced include metals, processed foods, beverages, printing and publishing, textiles and machinery. Most of the state&#x27;s industry takes place in the municipalities of Coatzacoalcos, Minatitlán, Cosoleacaque, Poza Rica, Córdoba, Orizaba, Tuxpan and Veracruz, with over 5,000 establishments. The rest is divided among nearly 11,000 smaller establishments. There are five major industrial parks: Bruno Pagliai, Ixtac, Petroquimico Morelos, Córdoba-Amatlán and Parque 2000. The largest of these is Bruno Pagliai, which covers .

Transportation and commerce are important factors in the state, mostly linked to importing and exporting through its four deepwater ports. The focus of most of these activities is the port of Veracruz. It has the most favored position on Mexico&#x27;s Gulf coast and is extensively used for exports to the United States, Latin America and Europe. Seventy-five percent of all port activity in Mexico takes place in Veracruz. The chief exports of this state are coffee, fresh fruits, fertilizer, sugar, fish and crustaceans. Other ports include those in Tuxpan and Coatzacoalcos. Most highway, rail and air connections link to the port of Veracruz and other ports to the south. The state has 73 companies that have been classified as high-volume exporters and it is ranked sixth in the country for exports. The state contains five major food wholesale markets, 146 government sponsored markets, about 75,000 private stores and 201 supermarkets. Wholesale vendors focus on agricultural products such as wood, livestock and food products. The major focal point for international business is the World Trade Center EXPOVER in Boca del Río. Inaugurated in 1989, the center has facilities to accommodate 5,000 people in , an exhibition hall of , a business center and parking for over 800 vehicles.

In the industrial sector, relatively poor municipios are not catching up to relatively rich ones though the latter are not diverging either. A policy of encouraging much more domestic and/or foreign investment is called
for if poorer areas are to prosper and the outflow of residents is to stop.

===Handcrafts===
In the more rural and indigenous areas of the state, a number of handicrafts are still made and sold both to local buyers and to tourists. Many of these crafts are produced by communities that specialize in one or more types. Wood furniture and other items are made by the Huasteca people, mostly using cedar and palm trees. The best work comes from the towns of Ozulama and Castillo de Teayo. Teocelo and Monte Blanco are known for bamboo furniture and other items. Musical instruments of wood such as a guitar called &quot;jarana&quot; are constructed in the Los Tuxtlas area, especially in Catemaco, with flutes made in Papantla. Wooden masks are made in Teocelo, and items made with the wood of coffee plants are made in Misantla, Coatepec, Huastusco and Xico. Corn husks are used to make decorative figures, often religious, in Nautla and Naranjos de Amatlán. Palm fronds are woven into fans, shoes and baskets in Jalcomulco, Ozulama and Tlalixcoyan.

Ceramics have been made in almost all parts of Veracruz since the Olmecs. One area known for its work is Papantla which also includes life sized representations of folk dancers from the area along with more mundane items of glazed and unglazed pottery. Minatitlán is known for its production of ceramic cooking utensils which are also popular in the neighboring municipalities of Actopan and Naolinco. San Miguel Aguasuelos and Jalcomulco are known for their white clay wares which include water jars, toys, nativity scenes, bells and more.

Traditional clothing and embroidery can be most easily found in the La Huasteca area, where elaborately decorated women&#x27;s blouses can be seen, especially in the El Higo and Tlalixcoyan area. In Totonacalpan, men are still often seen in white shirts and pants with a bag to hold personal items. This dress dates back to the early colonial period and had not changed much since then. Other areas specialize in wool items such as Naranjos de Amatlán, Minatilán and the city of Veracruz where items such as dresses, skirts and jackets. These and other textiles such as tablecloths and napkins are often decorated with cross-stitch. Leather items include shoes, jackets, bags, wallets, belts and boots and are usually made in the La Huasteca region, Teocolo, Citlaltépetl and Naolinco.

==Culture==
===Gastronomy===

The gastronomy of the state is unique in Mexico and mixed Spanish, indigenous, and Caribbean influences. From the pre-Hispanic period, the cuisine of the state was unique. The staple triumvirate of corn, beans, and squash was supplemented by tropical fruits, vanilla beans, and an herb called acuyo or hoja santa. Another important native contribution is seafood, which is featured in many dishes such as, arroz a la tumbada and caldo de mariscos (seafood soup).

After the conquest and during the colonial period, many other spices and ingredients were brought and have had a greater influence in the cooking here than in other parts of the country. From Europe, the Spanish brought saffron, parsley, thyme, marjoram, bay laurel, and cilantro as well Asian spices such as cloves, cinnamon, and black pepper. The Spaniards also brought wheat, rice, almonds, olives and olive oil, garlic, and capers. The latter three are essential ingredients in what is perhaps the most famous specialty of the region, huachinango a la veracruzana, red snapper in a spicy tomato sauce. Caribbean imports such as sugar cane and pineapple were adapted as well as the peanut, brought from Africa by the Portuguese (although the peanut is originally from South America).

Veracruz cuisine divides into six regions called Sotavento, Centro Norte, Centro Sur, Sierra, Costa Norte, and Los Tuxtlas. The Sotovento area is in the south of the state, and the dishes here are heavily based on rice. Common dishes include arroz a la tumbada, which is rice cooked with seafood or meat and rice with fried bananas. Seafood dishes are also prominent based mostly on fish and shrimp. A common ingredient in dishes is a herb called &quot;hoja santa&quot; or &quot;hierba Santa&quot;, which is a plant of the family Piperaceae. The Centro Norte is centered on Xalapa. Dishes here tend to be more indigenous in nature, heavily flavored with mild chili peppers. Common dishes here include Chilehuates, similar to a tamale, stuffed chile peppers, and enchiladas. Less seafood and more pork and domestic fowl are consumed. The Centro Sur area is mostly indigenous and encompasses the area of, Huatusco, Coscomatepec, Cotaxtla, Orizaba, Amatlán, Huilango y las españolas Córdoba y Fortín de las Flores, la negra Yanga and San Lorenzo de los Negros. Dishes here are similar to Centro Norte, but chayotes appear more often as this region is a major producer of the vegetable. Meats in adobo sauce are common as well. The Sierra and Costa Norte encompass the northern part of the state, such as the Pánuco River area and Totonacapan. This area is noted for a number of unique dishes such as frijoles en achuchutl, made with black beans, pork rind, chayotes, squash seeds, and jalapeño peppers. Bocoles are a kind of filled tortilla made with corn dough, stuffed with black beans, chorizo, eggs, or seafood, which then are fried in lard. Tamales are often made with banana leaves. The area is also known for its breads, especially anise–flavored rolls. The Los Tuxtlas area is centered on the communities of Santiago, San Andrés and Catemaco, which were the center of the Olmec civilization. The cuisine in this area features yucca, &quot;chocos&quot; (a type of edible flower), fish, especially mojarra, and exotic meats such as monkey, and iguana.

===Museums===
The state capital of Xalapa is also home to a number of important museums. The Museum of Anthropology contains the second most important collection of Mesoamerican artifacts in the country. It was built beginning in 1959 over six hectares. The complex is divided into various halls and galleries by theme, focusing on the Olmec and Totonac cultures. The Patio Olmeca contains the colossal head found in 1945 and known as El Rey (The King). Other important artifacts include giant stelae and San Martin Pajapan Monument 1 (at right).
The Museum of Science and Technology is in Xalapa. It contains more than 400 exhibitions in eight halls: Life, Ecology, Space, Transportation, Sciences, Energy, Water and Earth. The Pinoteca Diega Rivera was established by the state in the former Monastery of San Francisco in Xalapa. Its primary function is to preserve and display Rivera&#x27;s works owned by the state, but it also contains early works by José María Velasco, Jorge Cuesta and Teodoro A. Dehesa. Near the city is the Hacienda del Lencero, which was the home and headquarters of President Antonio López de Santa Anna in the 19th century. It has been preserved and turned into a museum.

In Tuxpan is the Regional Museum of Anthropology with more than 400 pieces from pre-Hispanic groups in the region, displayed in four halls. Most of the pieces come from the center of the state and from the Huasteca region.On the edge of the Tuxpan River. The city also has the Mexican-Cuban Museum. It contains a collection of photographs from the Cuban Revolution as well as a statue of José Martí.

Other museums are scattered in other parts of the state. The Salvador Ferrando Museum is located in Tlacotalpan and contains many everyday items and art from the 16th to the 19th centuries. The Tuxteco Regional Museum in Santiago de Tuxtla contains Olmec and Totonac artifacts including art objects, farming implements, utensils and more. In the garden area, there are giant stone sculptures from the Tres Zapotes site. The Jardín Central (Central Garden) of the municipality of Tierra Blanca has a number of Totonac archeological pieces on display. The Archeological Museum of Córdoba is in the city of the same name with three exhibition halls containing artifacts from the Maya, Olmec, Toltec and Huastec cultures. There is also a collection of historical photographs of the city. The Veracruz State Art Museum (Museo de Arte del Estado de Veracruz) is located in Orizaba in what was the monastery associated with the Concordia Church. Its collection includes works by Diego Rivera, Ignacio Rosas and Gonzalo Argüelles. It also contains a collection of historical photographs related to Veracruz and art. The Malintzin Archeological Museum is in the municipality of Nogales. It is a small museum with one hall, with photographs and documents. It is located in the church where Malinche and Juan de Jaramillo were supposedly married.

===Fairs and festivals===
The state is noted for its quantity and variety of festivals. The most important of these is Carnival in the city of Veracruz. This city&#x27;s version of the event begins with the &quot;burning of bad humor&quot;, which is represented in effigy. A number of kings and queens are &quot;crowned&quot; including categories for children but the most important is the Rey Feo (Ugly King) and the Reina del Carnaval (Queen of the Carnival). The latter is accompanies by cadets from the Naval Academy during the parade. This celebration is repeated all along the Veracruz coastline with other significant festivities taking place in Alvarado, Coatzacoalcos, San Rafael and Villa José Cardel. Minatitlán&#x27;s celebration draws people from the nearby states of Oaxaca and Tabasco. Day of the Dead is celebrated in almost all of Mexico from Oct 31 to November 2 but there are local twists in the state. In some places, it is commemorated during the months of August and September. In Papantla, boards or tables are placed on rooftops, which have been adorned with flowers, plant matter and more. In Tantoyuca, it is commemorated with costumes and music, similar to Carnival.

The Christian celebration of Candlemas is fused with traditions associated with Chalchiuhtlicua, the goddess of water, rivers, lakes and ocean. She was replaced by the Virgin of Candlemas, the protector of fishermen, making this celebration particularly important on the coast, especially in Tlacotalpan, where it is celebrated with much pomp. In Jáltipan de Morelos, ethnic Nahuas and Popolucas dress in elaborate costumes and arrange their hair in intricate styles. In Santa María Magdalena, on July 22, bulls are set free to roam the streets. Corn harvest festivals are prominent in the Huasteca region in municipalities such as Chontla, Chicontepec, and Ixhuatlán de Madero. These generally include native dances and foods based on corn.

===Dance and music===
The state is well known in the country for its music and dance. The fandango is a dance brought over from Spanish. Today the state has two varieties: the jarocho and the huasteco. Indigenous and folk dances in the state are most often associated with rituals and religious festivals. These include one called Los Lisceres also called the Tigres from the Los Tuxtlas region. Participants wear Olmec style masks which represent the rain god Tlalóc. Another is Los Guaguas in which the participants pay homage to the sun, and Los Santiagos, which is related to the veneration of Saint James, patron saint of Hernán Cortés. One last one is called Los Negritos (The Little Black Ones) which was created by African slaves. According to tradition, the origin of this dance lies in a story about a boy who was bitten by a snake and the rituals his family held to heal him.

However, the state&#x27;s most famous dance is as much a ritual and daredevil act as movements performed to music. The Danza de los Voladores (Dance of the Flyers) is a ceremony/ritual which has its roots in the pre-Hispanic period and presently best known as associated with the town of Papantla, Veracruz. It is believed to have originated with the Nahua, Huastec and Otomi peoples in central Mexico, and then spread throughout most of Mesoamerica. The ritual consists of dance and the climbing of a 30-meter pole from which four of the five participants then launch themselves tied with ropes to descend to the ground. The fifth remains on top of the pole, dancing and playing a flute and drum. According to myth, the ritual was created to ask the gods to end a severe drought. Although the ritual did not originate with the Totonac people, today it is most strongly associated with them, especially those in and around Papantla, as the ceremony has died off in most other places. The ceremony was named an Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO in order to help the ritual survive and thrive in the modern world.

The state&#x27;s best-known musical style is called the &quot;son&quot;. A &quot;son&quot; is a musical variation which traces its origins to Spain and developed during the 17th and 18th centuries. It is the state&#x27;s most popular musical style shows influences from the many peoples who have lived here such as indigenous groups, Portuguese, Italians, Africans, French and others. The music is generally performed by harps, violins and guitars, with an occasional wind instrument. Son huasteco (also called son huapango) is a variety of son played in the north of the state mostly among the Totonacs. Son jarocho is the better known and more popular variety played in the south of the state. The famous Grammy award-winning song &quot;La Bamba&quot; by Los Lobos is said have its roots in a traditional folk song from Veracruz (hence the reference to the &quot;Marinero&quot; in that song).

The state has produced a number of musicians famous in the country. One of the best known is Francisco Gabilondo Soler. Gabilondo Soler is best known for creating a character known as &quot;Cri-cri&quot;, a singing cricket for a radio show in the first half of the 20th century. As a musician, he specialized in writing children&#x27;s songs such as &quot;Abuelito&quot;, &quot;Caminito de la escuela&quot;, &quot;El baile de los muñecos&quot;, &quot;El burrito&quot; and &quot;La negrita Cucurumbé&quot;. A number of his works have been translated into other languages. Another famous musician is Agustín Lara, who has had more international fame. Nicknamed &quot;Flaco de oro&quot; (golden skinny one), he always insisted that he was born in Tlacotalpan, Veracruz and not Mexico City as records show. Lara formed his first band in 1930 called El Son de Marabú and toured almost continuously in Mexico and abroad during his career. His most famous compositions include &quot;Veracruz&quot;, &quot;Noche de Ronda&quot; and &quot;Solamente una vez&quot;. Other prominent musicians include Toña &quot;La Negra&quot; or María Antonia del Carmen Peregino, Narcisco Serradel, Lorenzo Barcelata and María Greever.

===Art and architecture===
During the colonial era, a movement called the &quot;estilo veracruzano&quot; (Veracruz style) developed mostly focusing on landscapes in the state with a certain amount of indigenous influence although the painters themselves were &quot;criollo&quot; or Mexico-born Spanish. These paintings focus on the mountains, valles, coasts, volcanos and other natural phenomena in the state. Most of the proponents of this were born in Veracruz itself and include José Justo Montiel (1824–1899), Gonzalo Argüelles Bringas (1877–1942), Eugenio Landecio (teacher of José María Velasco), Natal Pesado and Ignacio Rosas.

However, most of Veracruz&#x27;s best-known artists are from the 19th and 20th centuries. In the 19th century, these include Miguel Mata Reyes, Salvador Ferrando, José María Jara, Enrique Guerra and Alberto Fuster. Miguel Mata Reyes is best known for his contributions to the design of the Palacio de Bellas Artes as well a portrait of Antonio López de Santa Anna. Salvador Ferrando was a portrait and landscape artist from the north of the state. Until recently, most of his work had been hidden in a museum named after him in the Tlacotalpan region. Much of it now is on display at the Museo de Arte de Veracruz in Orizaba. José María Jara is noted for his paintings of Veracruz customs, whose works include &quot;El Velorio&quot;, which was presented at the World&#x27;s Fair in Paris. Enrique Guerra was an important sculptor at the end of the 19th century. His best-known works are bas reliefs and include &quot;Asesinato de César&quot;, &quot;Coroliano&quot;, &quot;Thais&quot; and &quot;Crisálida&quot;. Alberto Fuster was most active at the end of the century and is noted for bringing symbolism painting to Mexico from his stay in Europe. His works include &quot;El progreso&quot;, &quot;Safo en el templo de Delfos&quot; and &quot;Nativa con loro&quot;.

There are three important artists from the 20th century, Carlos Bracho, Norberto Martínez and Teodoro Cano García. Active in the first half of the century, sculptor Carlos Bracho&#x27;s work has been compared to that of Juan Rulfo. His works have been done in plaster, bronze, terracotta and green onyx and include monumental works which can be found in the cities of Xalapa, Puebla, Pachuca and Mexico City. His best-known works are El abrazo, Cabeza verde and El campesino se apodera de la tierra. Norberto Martínez only lived 45 years but is considered one of the most prolific of Mexican painters who dedicated most of his works to social themes. A number of these are early murals such as El comercio in the Jáuregi de Xalapa market as well as an untitled work in a private home in Córdoba which deals with the fusion of the Spanish, indigenous and African ethnicities in Mexico. Later works include the three murals in the main stairwell of the School of Law at the University of Xalapa and El hombre y el conocimiento at the Universidad Veracruzana. Teodoro Cano García is one of Mexico&#x27;s most famous muralists of the late 20th century, famous for the promotion of the Totonac culture of his hometown of Papantla. He has created paintings, sculptures, etchings, photography and mixed media works with his murals and sculptures most acclaimed. Examples of his work can be seen in various parts of public buildings in Papantla.

Most of Veracruz&#x27;s older architecture can be found in the inland cities of Xalapa and Córdoba. Despite being the first Spanish settlement, the city of Veracruz lost most its older structures to the various invasions it has suffered. Architecture from the 16th to the 19th century includes colonial Spanish, Moorish, Neo gothic and Neoclassical. From the 20th century on, a number of names stand out. Armando Bravo Ramírez remodeled the State Government Palace and the facade of the Capillas de Ánimas, both in Xalapa. Other prominent names responsible for many projects in the state include Luis González Aparicio, Bernal Lascuraín Rangel and Luis Manuel Tello Deschamps.

===Literature===
The literary arts reached their peak in Veracruz starting in the 19th century and extends to the &quot;Generation of the 1950s&quot;. Salvador Díaz Mirón is one of Veracruz&#x27;s most-distinguished poets. Over his lifetime from the latter 19th to early 20th centuries, he worked as a professor, politician and journalist contributing to periodicals such as El Veracruzano, El Orden, and El Imparcial. His creative works include some of the first Romantic pieces produced in Mexico such as Oda a Víctor Hugo, Ojos verdes, Gloria and Voces interiores. Other works include &quot;Poesías A Tirsa&quot;, &quot;Nox&quot; (also known as &quot;Claudia&quot;) and his last works such as &quot;Al buen cura&quot; and &quot;La mujer de nieve&quot;. He became a member of the Academia Mexicana de la Lengua and is buried at the Rotonda de los Hombres Ilustres in Mexico City. María Enriqueta Camarillo was one of a number of women writers to gain prominence in Mexico at the end of the 19th century. While she wrote a number of works such as &quot;Jirón del mundo&quot;, &quot;Sorpresas de la vida&quot; and &quot;El Secreto&quot;, she is best known for &quot;Rosas de la infancia&quot;, with which many Mexicans learned to read.

Writers born at the end of the 19th century, such as Gregorio López y Fuentes, Manuel Maples Arce and Jorge Mateo Cuesta Porte-Petit were often concerned with social issues. Works of this type include El Indio by López, Metrópolis by Maples and a poem called &quot;Canto a un dios mineral&quot; by Cuesta. The following generation, born in the first decades of the 20th century, became known as the Generation of the 1950s. During this time Veracruz&#x27;s literary tradition consolidated and decided to break type. One example is Juan Hernández Ramírez&#x27;s writing of poetry in the Nahuatl spoken in the La Huasteca area of Veracruz. One important name from this generation is Emilio Carballido who wrote about 100 plays as well as scripts for radio and television. Some of his works include &quot;Rosalba y los llaveros&quot;, &quot;Felicidad&quot; and &quot;Las visitaciones del Diablo&quot;. In 1996, he won the Premio Nacional de Literatura and in 2002 he received the Ariel de Oro for his work in cinema.

===Religion===
The Catholic patron saint of Veracruz is Rafael Guízar y Valencia.

==Education==
Public education in the state is supervised by the state Dirección General de Educación Popular and the Dirección General de Educación Media Superior y Superior. The current system is the result of a number of reforms which took place in the 1980s and 1990s. In the late 1990s, 302 new school campuses were created statewide and 257 schools were remodeled. These included new schools for special education, distance learning and technological institutes, giving the state one of the highest number of school campuses in the country. There are a total of 20,479 schools, with nearly 2 million students and about 85,000 teachers. 93% of schools are in the basic education category (preschool, primary and middle schools. Preschools also include those geared towards the indigenous populations, focusing on bilingual and bicultural education in both the indigenous language/culture and Spanish. One major focus of these and other schools is to eliminate illiteracy in indigenous communities. The &quot;Medio Superior&quot; level includes vocational high school and technical colleges. These account for 6.6% of schools in the public system. The Superior level includes teachers&#x27; colleges and universities. There are 166 institutes at this level, with about 68,000 students studying 221 different majors. There are also 63 master&#x27;s degree programs and six PhDs. These institutions serve about 135,000 students accounting for about 19% of the college-aged population (19- to 24-year-olds), slightly below the national average of 24%.

The major state university is the Universidad Veracruzana, with offers 56 bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 37 masters and 5 PhDs. It is based in the capital of Xalapa and is noted for its large and varied sports programs. There are campuses in fourteen other cities.

==Demographics==

=== Largest cities===

The state of Veracruz, especially its port, has been a crossroads for various cultures since the very early colonial period. The port of Veracruz has brought cargo, sailors, seamen, and slaves from various parts of the world, especially from the Caribbean and Europe. The state has indigenous cultural influences mixed with those from Europe, Africa and the . These can be best seen in the music, the culinary traditions and in the people themselves.

The number of ethnic communities in the state has been calculated at 2,062. The most numerous include the Nahuas, Totonacs, Huastecs, Popolucs, Zapotecas, Chinantecas, Otomis, Mazatecas, Tepehuas, Mixtecas, Zoques, Mixes, Mayas and Tzotzils, all indigenous groups. The largest are Nahuas, who make up over half of the indigenous population. Most native communities can be found in 68 municipalities especially in Tehuipango, Mixtla de Altamirano, Astacinga, Soledad Atzompa, Atlahuilco, Tequila, Tlaquilpan, Los Reyes, Magdalena, San Andres Tenejapan, Tantoyuca, Zongolica, Chicontepec, Papantla, Ixhuatlán de Madero, Soteapan, Playa Vicente, Mecayapan y Coyutla, Benito Juárez, Coxquihi, Espinal, Filomeno Mata, Ixcatepec, Mecatlán and Zozocolco de Hidalgo. In 1998, about 10% of the population spoke an indigenous language; however, this does not take into account all indigenous peoples. The census of 2005 counted 605,135 as speaking an indigenous language.

There are also small immigrant communities of Spaniards, Italians, Basque and Lebanese. Africans were first brought to Mexico through slavery to the Veracruz port. At one point, they outnumbered Europeans and a significant number ran away from haciendas and plantations to form their own communities, sometimes allied with indigenous groups. One such rebellion was led by Yanga, who successfully negotiated a free African community with Spanish authorities in 1609. Like other groups, many of African descent would intermarry with other groups, with the category of &quot;mulatto&quot; existing in the old colonial caste system for those with African blood. Today, the vast majority of Afro-Mexicans in Veracruz and other parts of the country are spread out and intermixed with the rest of the population. According to the 2020 Census, 2.67% of Veracruz&#x27;s population identified as Black, Afro-Mexican, or of African descent.

With a population of 7,110,214 (2005), Veracruz is the third most populous entity in the country, after the Federal District of Mexico City and the State of Mexico. Population growth has slowed in the state in the last decades, due to lower birthrates and the exodus of migrants, mostly men. Women outnumber men. One reason for the decline in birthrates is the elevation of education levels, especially among women. Another is urbanization, with about one-third of the state&#x27;s population living in urban centers, especially Veracruz, Xalapa, Coatzacoalcos, Minatitlán and Papantla. Most (90%) of the state&#x27;s communities, outside of municipal seats have fewer than 500 people and contain only 21% of the total population. The migration of men outside the state has put more women into the state&#x27;s workforce. Approximately 75% of the population is under 45 years of age and 30% under the age of 15.

Life expectancy is just under the norm for the rest of the country. The overwhelming majority of people in the state are Catholic, however, there is a significant Protestant minority and a number who profess the Jewish faith.

==Tourism==
Tourism mostly centers on the port city of Veracruz but there are other destinations. There are over 1,000 hotels in the state, over half of which are small, family-owned enterprises. Almost all of the four and five-star establishments are in metropolitan area of Veracruz. Many of the state major historical and cultural monuments are located in the port of Veracruz. Some of these include the Aquarium, the Museum of the city (Museo de la Ciudad), The Agustín Lara Museum, the Santiago Fortress (Baluarte de Santiago) the &quot;Las Atarazanas&quot; Museum and the San Juan de Ulúa Fort.

To the north of the port city is the Sierra or Totonacalpan area of the state, home to the Totonac people. This is home to the important pre-Hispanic city of El Tajín and the present-day city of Papantla. The modern city is best known as the home of the Totonac version of the &quot;danza de voladores&quot;; there, the dancers spin from high poles. The area is also the native habitat of the vanilla bean.

To the south of the port is on the coast, is Catemaco. This is in a tropical area. The area&#x27;s two main features are Lake Catemaco, which is located in the crater of an extinct volcano and Isla Tanaxpillo just off the coast. This island is also called the island of the monkeys or baboons due to a group of feral monkeys that escaped and found refuge here.

Inland is the coffee-growing region in and around the cities of Coatepec and Xalapa. Orizaba is best known for the volcano nearby but also has a large waterfall called El Elefante and a Cañon (Canyon) de Río Blanco.

==Archeological sites==

Cempoala is an archeological site located on the coast between the modern settlements of La Antigua and Ciudad Cardel. It was occupied when Hernán Cortés arrived, and he managed to form an alliance with the Totonacs here against the Aztecs. In the center of the site, there is a large plaza surrounded by temples and the palace of the Totonac chief. The site also has a small museum.

Quiahuiztlán is on the coast on a small mountain named Bernal. It is cut into the mountain as a series of terraces. It is located very close to where Cortés founded the initial Spanish settlement of Villa Rica de la Vera-Cruz.

The largest and most important site is El Tajín, located near the city of Papantla. The name is from the Totonac language and means &quot;thunder&quot;, but no one knows what the true name of this city was. It is also unknown if the Totonac built it, but since they have dominated the region for centuries, they lay claim to it. The city developed from the end of the Classic period and the beginning of the Post Classic period, between 800 and 1150 C.E. It is divided into five zones, the Plaza del Arroyo Group, the Central Zone, the Gran Xicalcoliuhqui, Tajín Chico and the Column Complex. Its signature building is the Pyramid of the Niches, named after the 365 niches built into the levels of the structure. The site has a large number of Mesoamerican ball game courts, one with details reliefs showing the beheading of a ballplayer and his role in the afterlife.

The Tres Zapotes site is located the community of the same name. Covering 1.5 hectares, the main building has a square base, which is surrounded by gardens and trees. The most important find from his is Stele &quot;C&quot; which is on display at the Museo Nacional de Antropología in Mexico City.

El Pital is a site in the municipality of Martínez de la Torre. It consists of a mound with a pyramid base and stairs on the east side. The site&#x27;s culture is considered to be a link between the coastal and highland cultures of the region.

Los Idolos is a site in the municipal city of Misantla, and was an important ceremonial site for the Totonacapan region. It consists of four rectangular patios linked by platforms and flat-topped mounds. Many of the structures are decorated with smooth river stone, thought to have come from the Misantla River.

The Centro Ceremonial Cuajilote is located on the Bobos River. It consists of a large plaza 400 meters long lined with structures. In the center of the plaza there are three shrines, one of which contains phallic figures.

<text>The clap skate (also called clapper skates, clapskates, slap skates, slapskates, from Dutch ) is a type of ice skate used in speed skating. Unlike in traditional skates where the blade is rigidly fixed to the boot, clap skates have the blade attached to the boot by a hinge at the front. This allows the blade to remain in contact with the ice longer, as the ankle can now be extended toward the end of the stroke, as well as for more natural movement, thereby distributing the energy of the leg more effectively and efficiently.

Clap skates were developed at the Faculty of Human Movement Sciences of the Vrije Universiteit of Amsterdam, led by Gerrit Jan van Ingen Schenau, although the idea of a clap skate is much older; designs dating from around 1900 are known.

The clap skate was used first in the 1984/1985 skating season. It was, however, not until the late 1990s that the idea was taken seriously. In the 1996/1997 season, the Dutch women&#x27;s team started using the skates with great success. The rest of the skating world soon followed suit, causing a torrent of world records to be broken in the following seasons, including the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.

==History==
The idea of a hinging skate was described and patented in 1894 by Karl Hannes, from Raitenhaslach, Burghausen. It was re-invented by Gerrit Jan van Ingen Schenau, who started work on a hinged speed skate in 1979, created his first prototype in 1980 and finished his PhD thesis on the subject in 1981 on the premise that a skater would benefit from the extended movement with the skate on the ice, allowing the calf muscles to longer partake in the skate movement. The construction of the hinge was refined further in collaboration with Viking. In 1985 Ron Ket was the first to ride the clap skates in an officially timed setting, a 500-meter sprint on the Jaap Eden baan, clocking in on a promising 40.65. In February 1986 Henk Gemser who was coaching the Dutch national speedskating squad at that time expressed his intention to start training with the clap skate, though no subsequent trials were run on the new skate. In the 1986–1987 season a small number of marathon skaters intended to use the clap skate competitively, but its use was prohibited by match officials due to increased risk of physical harm to the skaters in case of a fall. The then current Dutch speed skating top professionals Ids Postma, Bart Veldkamp and Rintje Ritsma were unimpressed by the skate.

For the 1994–1995 season, 11 skaters from the South Holland 14–18 age category started using the clap skate competitively. Those 11 showed an average improvement of 6.25% on their times, compared to 2.5% of the other skaters using regular speed skates. Ten of them placed for the national championship.

In the 1996–1997 season, the use of the clap skate caught on the highest level, and in 1997 Tonny de Jong was the first European all round champion using the clap skate, leaving Gunda Niemann, the defending world champion, in second place. Niemann remarked that the skate was illegal, and should be outlawed. In the following years the clap skate started to dominate the long track speedskating landscape. The design was banned from use in short track speed skating.

Research completed in 2001 by Dutch sport scientist Han Houdijk showed that the speed gain from using the clap skate does not originate in using the calf muscle to stretch the ankle, as was assumed in the creation of the clap skate, but in the fact that the point of rotation is moved from the tip of the skate to the hinge, facilitating the transfer of power to the ice.

<text>John Francis Bongiovi Jr. (born March 2, 1962), known professionally as Jon Bon Jovi, is an American singer, songwriter, guitarist, and actor. He is best known as the founder and frontman of the rock band Bon Jovi, which was formed in 1983. He has released 16 studio albums with his band as well as two solo albums.

In the 1990s, Bon Jovi started an acting career, starring in the films &quot;Moonlight and Valentino, The Leading Man, Little City, Homegrown&quot;, &quot;Pay It Forward&quot;&quot;,&quot; &quot;U-571 and Cry Wolf&quot; and appearing on television in shows such as &quot;Sex and the City&quot;, &quot;30 Rock&quot;, &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, and &quot;The West Wing&quot;.

Bon Jovi was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2009. In 2012, he ranked number 50 on the list of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Power 100&quot;, a ranking of &quot;The Most Powerful and Influential People in the Music Business&quot;.

Bon Jovi is a founder and former majority owner of an Arena Football League team, the Philadelphia Soul.

==Early life and education==
John Francis Bongiovi Jr. was born in Perth Amboy, New Jersey. His father John Francis Bongiovi Sr. (born 1930) was a barber and a former Marine. His mother Carol (née Sharkey; 1940–2024), also a former Marine, was a florist and Playboy Bunny. His father was of Italian and Slovak ancestry; the name &quot;Bongiovi&quot; comes from Sciacca, Sicily. His mother was of German and Russian descent. 

Bon Jovi was raised Catholic. He attended St. Joseph High School in Metuchen, New Jersey, during his freshman and sophomore years. He later transferred to Sayreville War Memorial High School in Parlin, New Jersey.

==Musical career==

===Beginnings===
Bon Jovi began playing music in 1974, when he formed his first band Raze and took part in a talent contest at his school. At 16, he formed a band called Atlantic City Expressway and was joined by David Bryan, who would later become a member of the Bon Jovi band. Still in his teens, Bon Jovi played in the band John Bongiovi and the Wild Ones, performing in clubs such as the Fast Lane and opening for local acts. By 1980, he had formed his first original band, the Rest; the band opened for New Jersey acts such as Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes.

At the time, Bon Jovi ran errands between gigs at the Power Station recording studio owned by his cousin Tony Bongiovi. One day, he was sweeping the floor as Disco producer Meco was in the studio recording &quot;Christmas in the Stars: The Star Wars Christmas Album.&quot; Meco suggested that Bon Jovi sing &quot;R2-D2 We Wish You a Merry Christmas&quot;, which became his first professional recording (credited as John Bongiovi).

===Bon Jovi===
In March 1983, Bon Jovi called bassist Alec John Such and Such called experienced drummer Tico Torres and guitarist Richie Sambora. Bon Jovi, Sambora, Such, Bryan, and Torres became the founding members of the band Bon Jovi. In 1984 and 1985, Bon Jovi released its first two albums.

In 1986, the band achieved widespread success and global recognition with its third album, &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot;, which had sold 28 million copies worldwide as of 2011. &quot;Slippery When Wet&quot; included three Top 10 singles, two of which--&quot;You Give Love a Bad Name&quot; and &quot;Livin&#x27; on a Prayer&quot;--reached number one.

The song &quot;Next 100 years&quot; from the album Crush, written by him and Sambora, is a self cover. The Japanese version, with lyrics by B&#x27;z&#x27;s Koshi Inaba, was recorded first in 1999 by Johnny &amp; Associates&#x27;s special unit called J-Friends as part of the relief efforts for the 1995 Great Hanshin earthquake. The live version of the song was also included in a DVD released in April 2003, &quot;J-FRIENDS Never Ending Spirit 1997-2003&quot;. It included performances from several of the agency&#x27;s groups, as well as by the special unit.

As of 2019, Bon Jovi has released 15 studio albums, five compilations and three live albums. The band has sold more than 130 million records worldwide, making it one of the bestselling American rock bands. Bon Jovi has performed more than 2,700 concerts in over 50 countries for more than 34 million fans. Bon Jovi was inducted into the UK Music Hall of Fame in 2006, and into the U.S. Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2018.

Having been originally approached by his friend Emilio Estevez to lend &quot;Wanted Dead or Alive&quot; as the theme song for his upcoming Billy the Kid sequel, Bon Jovi ended up composing an all-new theme song for the film&#x27;s soundtrack and delivering his first solo album. The album featured guests such as Elton John, Little Richard and Jeff Beck. The title track, &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot;, peaked at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In 1991, &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot; won an award for Favorite Pop/Rock Single at the American Music Awards and won a Golden Globe as well. The song also earned Jon Bon Jovi an Academy Award nomination and a Grammy Award nomination.

He had recovered from the disease by November 12, 2021. In April 2022, Bon Jovi spoke of how much his COVID-19 experience had affected him, including in his songwriting, saying about COVID-19 that it made him realize &quot;how volatile we are and how fragile life is. It didn&#x27;t matter if you were young or old, American or Egyptian, no matter who you were or where you were from, the COVID-19 pandemic affected you. I was aware of that when I was writing the record.&quot;

On September 11, 2024, Bon Jovi helped prevent a woman from jumping off the John Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge in Nashville.

<text>Marc Chagall (born Moishe Shagal; – 28 March 1985) was a Russian and French artist. An early modernist, he was associated with the École de Paris, as well as several major artistic styles and created works in a wide range of artistic formats, including painting, drawings, book illustrations, stained glass, stage sets, ceramics, tapestries and fine art prints.

Chagall was born in 1887, into a Jewish family near Vitebsk, today in Belarus, but at that time in the Pale of Settlement of the Russian Empire. Before World War I, he travelled between Saint Petersburg, Paris, and Berlin. During that period, he created his own mixture and style of modern art, based on his ideas of Eastern European and Jewish folklore. He spent the wartime years in his native Belarus, becoming one of the country&#x27;s most distinguished artists and a member of the modernist avant-garde, founding the Vitebsk Arts College. He later worked in and near Moscow in difficult conditions during hard times in Russia following the Bolshevik Revolution, before leaving again for Paris in 1923. During World War II, he escaped occupied France to the United States, where he lived in New York City for seven years before returning to France in 1948.

Art critic Robert Hughes referred to Chagall as &quot;the quintessential Jewish artist of the twentieth century&quot;. According to art historian Michael J. Lewis, Chagall was considered to be &quot;the last survivor of the first generation of European modernists&quot;. For decades, he &quot;had also been respected as the world&#x27;s pre-eminent Jewish artist&quot;. Using the medium of stained glass, he produced windows for the cathedrals of Reims and Metz as well as the Fraumünster in Zürich, windows for the UN and the Art Institute of Chicago and the Jerusalem Windows in Israel. He also did large-scale paintings, including part of the ceiling of the Paris Opéra. He experienced modernism&#x27;s &quot;golden age&quot; in Paris, where &quot;he synthesized the art forms of Cubism, Symbolism, and Fauvism, and the influence of Fauvism gave rise to Surrealism&quot;. Yet throughout these phases of his style &quot;he remained most emphatically a Jewish artist, whose work was one long dreamy reverie of life in his native village of Vitebsk.&quot; &quot;When Matisse dies&quot;, Pablo Picasso remarked in the 1950s, &quot;Chagall will be the only painter left who understands what colour really is&quot;.

==Early life and education==

===Early life===

Marc Chagall was born Moishe Shagal in 1887, into a Jewish family in Liozna, near the city of Vitebsk, Belarus, then part of the Russian Empire. At the time of his birth, Vitebsk&#x27;s population was about 66,000. Half of the population was Jewish. A picturesque city of churches and synagogues, it was called &quot;Russian Toledo&quot; by artist Ilya Repin, after the cosmopolitan city of the former Spanish Empire. Because the city was built mostly of wood, little of it survived years of occupation and destruction during World War II.

Chagall was the eldest of nine children. The family name, Shagal, is a variant of the name Segal, which in a Jewish community was usually borne by a Levitic family. His father, Khatskl (Zachar) Shagal, was employed by a herring merchant, and his mother, Feige-Ite, sold groceries from their home. His father worked hard, carrying heavy barrels, earning 20 roubles each month (the average wages across the Russian Empire was 13 roubles a month). Chagall wrote of those early years:

One of the main sources of income for the Jewish population of the town was from the manufacture of clothing that was sold throughout the Russian Empire. They also made furniture and various agricultural tools. From the late 18th century to the First World War, the Imperial Russian government confined Jews to living within the Pale of Settlement, which included modern Ukraine, Belarus, Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia, almost exactly corresponding to the territory of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth which was taken over by Imperial Russia in the late 18th century. That led to the creation of Jewish market-villages (shtetls) throughout today&#x27;s Eastern Europe, with their own markets, schools, hospitals, and other community institutions.

Chagall wrote as a boy; &quot;I felt at every step that I was a Jew—people made me feel it&quot;. During a pogrom, Chagall wrote that: &quot;The street lamps are out. I feel panicky, especially in front of butchers&#x27; windows. There you can see calves that are still alive lying beside the butchers&#x27; hatchets and knives&quot;. When asked by some &quot;pogromniks&quot; &quot;Jew or not?&quot;, Chagall remembered thinking: &quot;My pockets are empty, my fingers sensitive, my legs weak and they are out for blood. My death would be futile. I so wanted to live&quot;. Chagall denied being a Jew, leading the &quot;pogromniks&quot; to shout &quot;All right! Get along!&quot;

Most of what is known about Chagall&#x27;s early life has come from his autobiography, &quot;My Life&quot;. In it, he described the major influence that the culture of Hasidic Judaism had on his life as an artist. Chagall related how he realised that the Jewish traditions in which he had grown up were fast disappearing and that he needed to document them. From the 1730s, Vitebsk itself had been a centre of that culture, with its teachings derived from the Kabbalah. Chagall scholar, Susan Tumarkin Goodman, describes the links and sources of his art to his early home:

===Art education===
In the Russian Empire at that time, Jewish children were not allowed to attend regular schools and universities imposed a quota on Jews. Their movement within the city was also restricted. Chagall therefore received his primary education at the local Jewish religious school, where he studied Hebrew and the Bible. At the age of 13, his mother tried to enrol him in a regular high school, and he recalled: &quot;But in that school, they don&#x27;t take Jews. Without a moment&#x27;s hesitation, my courageous mother walks up to a professor.&quot; She offered the headmaster 50 roubles to let him attend, which he accepted.

A turning point of his artistic life came when he first noticed a fellow student drawing. Baal-Teshuva writes that, for the young Chagall, watching someone draw &quot;was like a vision, a revelation in black and white&quot;. Chagall would later say that there was no art of any kind in his family&#x27;s home and the concept was totally alien to him. When Chagall asked the schoolmate how he learned to draw, his friend replied, &quot;Go and find a book in the library, idiot, choose any picture you like, and just copy it&quot;. He soon began copying images from books and found the experience so rewarding he then decided he wanted to become an artist.

Goodman writes that Chagall eventually confided to his mother, &quot;I want to be a painter&quot;, although she could not yet understand his sudden interest in art or why he would choose a vocation that &quot;seemed so impractical&quot;. The young Chagall explained: &quot;There&#x27;s a place in town; if I&#x27;m admitted and if I complete the course, I&#x27;ll come out a regular artist. I&#x27;d be so happy!&quot; It was 1906, and he had noticed the studio of Yehuda (Yuri) Pen, a realist artist who operated a drawing school in Vitebsk. At the same time, future artists El Lissitzky and Ossip Zadkine were also Pen&#x27;s students. Due to Chagall&#x27;s youth and lack of income, Pen offered to teach him free of charge. However, after a few months at the school, Chagall realized that academic portrait painting did not suit him.

===Artistic inspiration===
Goodman notes that during that period in Imperial Russia, Jews had two ways to join the art world: one was to &quot;hide or deny one&#x27;s Jewish roots&quot;, the other—the one that Chagall chose—was &quot;to cherish and publicly express one&#x27;s Jewish roots&quot; by integrating them into art. For Chagall, that was also his means of &quot;self-assertion and an expression of principle&quot;.

Chagall biographer, Franz Meyer, explains that with the connections between his art and early life &quot;the hassidic spirit is still the basis and source of nourishment for his art&quot;. Lewis adds: &quot;As cosmopolitan an artist as he would later become, his storehouse of visual imagery would never expand beyond the landscape of his childhood, with its snowy streets, wooden houses, and ubiquitous fiddlers... [with] scenes of childhood so indelibly in one&#x27;s mind and to invest them with an emotional charge so intense that it could only be discharged obliquely through an obsessive repetition of the same cryptic symbols and ideograms... &quot;

Years later, at the age of 57, while living in the United States, Chagall confirmed that when he published an open letter entitled, &quot;To My City Vitebsk&quot;:

Why? Why did I leave you many years ago? ... You thought, the boy seeks something, seeks such a special subtlety, that color descending like stars from the sky and landing, bright and transparent, like snow on our roofs. Where did he get it? How would it come to a boy like him? I don&#x27;t know why he couldn&#x27;t find it with us, in the city—in his homeland. Maybe the boy is &quot;crazy&quot;, but &quot;crazy&quot; for the sake of art. ...You thought: &quot;I can see, I am etched in the boy&#x27;s heart, but he is still &#x27;flying&#x27;, he is still striving to take off, he has &#x27;wind&#x27; in his head.&quot; ... I did not live with you, but I didn&#x27;t have one single painting that didn&#x27;t breathe with your spirit and reflection.

==Art career==

===Russian Empire (1906–1910)===
In 1906, he moved to Saint Petersburg, which was then the capital of the Russian Empire and the center of the country&#x27;s artistic life, with famous art schools. Since Jews were not permitted into the city without an internal passport, he managed to get a temporary passport from a friend. He enrolled in a prestigious art school and studied there for two years. By 1907, he had begun painting naturalistic self-portraits and landscapes. Chagall was an active member of the irregular freemasonic lodge, the Grand Orient of Russia&#x27;s Peoples. He belonged to the &quot;Vitebsk&quot; lodge.

Between 1908 and 1910, Chagall was a student of Léon Bakst at the Zvantseva School of Drawing and Painting. While in Saint Petersburg, he discovered experimental theater, and the work of such artists as Paul Gauguin. Bakst, also Jewish, was a designer of decorative art and was famous as a draftsman designer of stage sets and costumes for the Ballets Russes, and helped Chagall by acting as a role model for Jewish success. Bakst moved to Paris a year later. Art historian Raymond Cogniat writes that after living and studying art on his own for four years, &quot;Chagall entered into the mainstream of contemporary art. ...His apprenticeship over, Russia had played a memorable initial role in his life.&quot;

Chagall stayed in Saint Petersburg until 1910, often visiting Vitebsk where he met Bella Rosenfeld. In &quot;My Life&quot;, Chagall described his first meeting her: &quot;Her silence is mine, her eyes mine. It is as if she knows everything about my childhood, my present, my future, as if she can see right through me.&quot; Bella later wrote, of meeting him, &quot;When you did catch a glimpse of his eyes, they were as blue as if they&#x27;d fallen straight out of the sky. They were strange eyes … long, almond-shaped … and each seemed to sail along by itself, like a little boat.&quot;

===France (1910–1914)===

 In 1910, Chagall relocated to Paris to develop his artistic style. Art historian and curator James Sweeney notes that when Chagall first arrived in Paris, Cubism was the dominant art form, and French art was still dominated by the &quot;materialistic outlook of the 19th century&quot;. But Chagall arrived from Russia with &quot;a ripe color gift, a fresh, unashamed response to sentiment, a feeling for simple poetry and a sense of humor&quot;, he adds. These notions were alien to Paris at that time, and as a result, his first recognition came not from other painters but from poets such as Blaise Cendrars and Guillaume Apollinaire. Art historian Jean Leymarie observes that Chagall began thinking of art as &quot;emerging from the internal being outward, from the seen object to the psychic outpouring&quot;, which was the reverse of the Cubist way of creating.

He therefore developed friendships with Guillaume Apollinaire and other avant-garde artists including Robert Delaunay and Fernand Léger. Baal-Teshuva writes that &quot;Chagall&#x27;s dream of Paris, the city of light and above all, of freedom, had come true.&quot; His first days were a hardship for the 23-year-old Chagall, who was lonely in the big city and unable to speak French. Some days he &quot;felt like fleeing back to Russia, as he daydreamed while he painted, about the riches of Slavic folklore, his Hasidic experiences, his family, and especially Bella&quot;.

In Paris, he enrolled at Académie de La Palette, an avant-garde school of art where the painters Jean Metzinger, André Dunoyer de Segonzac and Henri Le Fauconnier taught, and also found work at another academy. He would spend his free hours visiting galleries and salons, especially the Louvre; artists he came to admire included Rembrandt, the Le Nain brothers, Chardin, van Gogh, Renoir, Pissarro, Matisse, Gauguin, Courbet, Millet, Manet, Monet, Delacroix, and others. It was in Paris that he learned the technique of gouache, which he used to paint Belarusian scenes. He also visited Montmartre and the Latin Quarter &quot;and was happy just breathing Parisian air&quot;. Baal-Teshuva describes this new phase in Chagall&#x27;s artistic development:


During his time in Paris, Chagall was constantly reminded of his home in Vitebsk, as Paris was also home to many painters, writers, poets, composers, dancers, and other émigrés from the Russian Empire. However, &quot;night after night he painted until dawn&quot;, only then going to bed for a few hours, and resisted the many temptations of the big city at night. &quot;My homeland exists only in my soul&quot;, he once said. He continued painting Jewish motifs and subjects from his memories of Vitebsk, although he included Parisian scenes — the Eiffel Tower in particular, along with portraits. Many of his works were updated versions of paintings he had made in Russia, transposed into Fauvist or Cubist keys.

Chagall developed a whole repertoire of quirky motifs: ghostly figures floating in the sky, ... the gigantic fiddler dancing on miniature dollhouses, the livestock and transparent wombs and, within them, tiny offspring sleeping upside down. The majority of his scenes of life in Vitebsk were painted while living in Paris, and &quot;in a sense they were dreams&quot;, notes Lewis. Their &quot;undertone of yearning and loss&quot;, with a detached and abstract appearance, caused Apollinaire to be &quot;struck by this quality&quot;, calling them &quot;surnaturel!&quot; His &quot;animal/human hybrids and airborne phantoms&quot; would later become a formative influence on Surrealism. Chagall, however, did not want his work to be associated with any school or movement and considered his own personal language of symbols to be meaningful to himself. But Sweeney notes that others often still associate his work with &quot;illogical and fantastic painting&quot;, especially when he uses &quot;curious representational juxtapositions&quot;.

Sweeney writes that &quot;This is Chagall&#x27;s contribution to contemporary art: the reawakening of a poetry of representation, avoiding factual illustration on the one hand, and non-figurative abstractions on the other&quot;. André Breton said that &quot;with him alone, the metaphor made its triumphant return to modern painting&quot;.

===Russia (1914–1922)===
Because he missed his fiancée, Bella, who was still in Vitebsk—&quot;He thought about her day and night&quot;, writes Baal-Teshuva—and was afraid of losing her, Chagall decided to accept an invitation from a noted art dealer in Berlin to exhibit his work, his intention being to continue on to Belarus, marry Bella, and then return with her to Paris. Chagall took 40 canvases and 160 gouaches, watercolors and drawings to be exhibited. The exhibit, held at Herwarth Walden&#x27;s Sturm Gallery was a huge success, &quot;The German critics positively sang his praises.&quot;
After the exhibit, he continued on to Vitebsk, where he planned to stay only long enough to marry Bella. However, after a few weeks, the First World War began, closing the Russian border for an indefinite period. A year later he married Bella Rosenfeld and they had their first child, Ida. Before the marriage, Chagall had difficulty convincing Bella&#x27;s parents that he would be a suitable husband for their daughter. They were worried about her marrying a painter from a poor family and wondered how he would support her. Becoming a successful artist now became a goal and inspiration. According to Lewis, &quot;[T]he euphoric paintings of this time, which show the young couple floating balloon-like over Vitebsk—its wooden buildings faceted in the Delaunay manner—are the most lighthearted of his career&quot;. His wedding pictures were also a subject he would return to in later years as he thought about this period of his life.
In 1915, Chagall began exhibiting his work in Moscow, first exhibiting his works at a well-known salon and in 1916 exhibiting pictures in St. Petersburg. He again showed his art at a Moscow exhibition of avant-garde artists. This exposure brought recognition, and a number of wealthy collectors began buying his art. He also began illustrating a number of Yiddish books with ink drawings. He illustrated I. L. Peretz&#x27;s &quot;The Magician&quot; in 1917. Chagall was 30 years old and had begun to become well known.

The October Revolution of 1917 was a dangerous time for Chagall although it also offered opportunity. Chagall wrote he came to fear Bolshevik orders pinned on fences, writing: &quot;The factories were stopping. The horizons opened. Space and emptiness. No more bread. The black lettering on the morning posters made me feel sick at heart&quot;. Chagall was often hungry for days, later remembering watching &quot;a bride, the beggars and the poor wretches weighted down with bundles&quot;, leading him to conclude that the new regime had turned the Russian Empire &quot;upside down the way I turn my pictures&quot;. By then he was one of Imperial Russia&#x27;s most distinguished artists and a member of the modernist avant-garde, which enjoyed special privileges and prestige as the &quot;aesthetic arm of the revolution&quot;. He was offered a notable position as a commissar of visual arts for the country, but preferred something less political, and instead accepted a job as commissar of arts for Vitebsk. This resulted in his founding the Vitebsk Arts College which, adds Lewis, became the &quot;most distinguished school of art in the Soviet Union&quot;.

It obtained for its faculty some of the most important artists in the country, such as El Lissitzky and Kazimir Malevich. He also added his first teacher, Yehuda Pen. Chagall tried to create an atmosphere of a collective of independently minded artists, each with their own unique style. However, this would soon prove to be difficult as a few of the key faculty members preferred a Suprematist art of squares and circles, and disapproved of Chagall&#x27;s attempt at creating &quot;bourgeois individualism&quot;. Chagall then resigned as commissar and moved to Moscow.

In Moscow he was offered a job as stage designer for the newly formed State Jewish Chamber Theater. It was set to begin operation in early 1921 with a number of plays by Sholem Aleichem. For its opening he created a number of large background murals using techniques he learned from Bakst, his early teacher. One of the main murals was tall by long and included images of various lively subjects such as dancers, fiddlers, acrobats, and farm animals. One critic at the time called it &quot;Hebrew jazz in paint&quot;. Chagall created it as a &quot;storehouse of symbols and devices&quot;, notes Lewis. The murals &quot;constituted a landmark&quot; in the history of the theatre, and were forerunners of his later large-scale works, including murals for the New York Metropolitan Opera and the Paris Opera.

The First World War ended in 1918, but the Russian Civil War continued, and famine spread. The Chagalls found it necessary to move to a smaller, less expensive, town near Moscow, although Chagall now had to commute to Moscow daily, using crowded trains. In 1921, he worked as an art teacher along with his friend sculptor Isaac Itkind in a Jewish boys&#x27; shelter in suburban Malakhovka, which housed young refugees orphaned by pogroms. While there, he created a series of illustrations for the Yiddish poetry cycle &quot;Grief&quot; written by David Hofstein, who was another teacher at the Malakhovka shelter.

After spending the years between 1921 and 1922 living in primitive conditions, he decided to go back to France so that he could develop his art in a more comfortable country. Numerous other artists, writers, and musicians were also planning to relocate to the West. He applied for an exit visa and while waiting for its uncertain approval, wrote his autobiography, &quot;My Life&quot;.

===France (1923–1941)===
In 1923, Chagall left Moscow to return to France. On his way he stopped in Berlin to recover the many pictures he had left there on exhibit ten years earlier, before the war began, but was unable to find or recover any of them. Nonetheless, after returning to Paris he again &quot;rediscovered the free expansion and fulfillment which were so essential to him&quot;, writes Lewis. With all his early works now lost, he began trying to paint from his memories of his earliest years in Vitebsk with sketches and oil paintings.

He formed a business relationship with French art dealer Ambroise Vollard. This inspired him to begin creating etchings for a series of illustrated books, including Gogol&#x27;s &quot;Dead Souls&quot;, the Bible, and the &quot;La Fontaine&#x27;s Fables&quot;. These illustrations would eventually come to represent his finest printmaking efforts. In 1924, he travelled to Brittany and painted &quot;La fenêtre sur l&#x27;Île-de-Bréhat&quot;. By 1926 he had his first exhibition in the United States at the Reinhardt gallery of New York which included about 100 works, although he did not travel to the opening. He instead stayed in France, &quot;painting ceaselessly&quot;, notes Baal-Teshuva. It was not until 1927 that Chagall made his name in the French art world, when art critic and historian Maurice Raynal awarded him a place in his book &quot;Modern French Painters&quot;. However, Raynal was still at a loss to accurately describe Chagall to his readers:

During this period he traveled throughout France and the Côte d&#x27;Azur, where he enjoyed the landscapes, colorful vegetation, the blue Mediterranean Sea, and the mild weather. He made repeated trips to the countryside, taking his sketchbook. He also visited nearby countries and later wrote about the impressions some of those travels left on him:

====&quot;The Bible&quot; illustrations====

After returning to Paris from one of his trips, Vollard commissioned Chagall to illustrate the Old Testament. Although he could have completed the project in France, he used the assignment as an excuse to travel to Mandatory Palestine to experience for himself the Holy Land. In 1931 Marc Chagall and his family traveled to Tel Aviv on the invitation of Meir Dizengoff. Dizengoff had previously encouraged Chagall to visit Tel Aviv in connection with Dizengoff&#x27;s plan to build a Jewish Art Museum in the new city. Chagall and his family were invited to stay at Dizengoff&#x27;s house in Tel Aviv, which later became Independence Hall of the State of Israel.

Chagall ended up staying in the Holy Land for two months. Chagall felt at home in Israel where many people spoke Yiddish and Russian. According to Jacob Baal-Teshuva, &quot;he was impressed by the pioneering spirit of the people in the kibbutzim and deeply moved by the Wailing Wall and the other holy places&quot;.

Chagall later told a friend that Israel gave him &quot;the most vivid impression he had ever received&quot;. Wullschlager notes, however, that whereas Delacroix and Matisse had found inspiration in the exoticism of North Africa, he as a Jew in Israel had different perspective. &quot;What he was really searching for there was not external stimulus but an inner authorization from the land of his ancestors, to plunge into his work on the Bible illustrations&quot;. Chagall stated that &quot;In the East I found the Bible and part of my own being.&quot;

As a result, he immersed himself in &quot;the history of the Jews, their trials, prophecies, and disasters&quot;, notes Wullschlager. She adds that beginning the assignment was an &quot;extraordinary risk&quot; for Chagall, as he had finally become well known as a leading contemporary painter, but would now end his modernist themes and delve into &quot;an ancient past&quot;. Between 1931 and 1934 he worked &quot;obsessively&quot; on &quot;The Bible&quot;, even going to Amsterdam in order to carefully study the biblical paintings of Rembrandt and El Greco, to see the extremes of religious painting. He walked the streets of the city&#x27;s Jewish quarter to again feel the earlier atmosphere. He told Franz Meyer:

Chagall saw the Old Testament as a &quot;human story, ... not with the creation of the cosmos but with the creation of man, and his figures of angels are rhymed or combined with human ones&quot;, writes Wullschlager. She points out that in one of his early Bible images, &quot;Abraham and the Three Angels&quot;, the angels sit and chat over a glass of wine &quot;as if they have just dropped by for dinner&quot;.

He returned to France and by the next year had completed 32 out of the total of 105 plates. By 1939, at the beginning of World War II, he had finished 66. However, Vollard died that same year. When the series was completed in 1956, it was published by Edition Tériade. Baal-Teshuva writes that &quot;the illustrations were stunning and met with great acclaim. Once again Chagall had shown himself to be one of the 20th century&#x27;s most important graphic artists&quot;. Leymarie has described these drawings by Chagall as &quot;monumental&quot; and,

====Nazi campaigns against modern art====
Not long after Chagall began his work on the &quot;Bible&quot;, Adolf Hitler gained power in Germany. Anti-Semitic laws were being introduced and the first concentration camp at Dachau had been established. Wullschlager describes the early effects on art:

Beginning during 1937 about twenty thousand works from German museums were confiscated as &quot;degenerate&quot; by a committee directed by Joseph Goebbels. Although the German press had once &quot;swooned over him&quot;, the new German authorities now made a mockery of Chagall&#x27;s art, describing them as &quot;green, purple, and red Jews shooting out of the earth, fiddling on violins, flying through the air ... representing [an] assault on Western civilization&quot;.

After Germany invaded and occupied France, the Chagalls remained in Vichy France, unaware that French Jews, with the help of the Vichy government, were being collected and sent to German concentration camps, from which few would return. The Vichy collaborationist government, directed by Marshal Philippe Pétain, immediately upon assuming power established a commission to &quot;redefine French citizenship&quot; with the aim of stripping &quot;undesirables&quot;, including naturalized citizens, of their French nationality. Chagall had been so involved with his art, that it was not until October 1940, after the Vichy government, at the behest of the Nazi occupying forces, began approving anti-Semitic laws, that he began to understand what was happening. Learning that Jews were being removed from public and academic positions, the Chagalls finally &quot;woke up to the danger they faced&quot;. But Wullschlager notes that &quot;by then they were trapped&quot;. Their only refuge could be the US, but &quot;they could not afford the passage to New York&quot; or the large bond that each immigrant had to provide upon entry to ensure that they would not become a financial burden to the country.

====Escaping occupied France====
According to Wullschlager, &quot;[T]he speed with which France collapsed astonished everyone: the [British-supported French army] capitulated even more quickly than Poland had done&quot; a year earlier. Shock waves crossed the Atlantic... as Paris had until then been equated with civilization throughout the non-Nazi world.&quot; Yet the attachment of the Chagalls to France &quot;blinded them to the urgency of the situation.&quot; Many other well-known Russian and Jewish artists eventually sought to escape: these included Chaïm Soutine, Max Ernst, Max Beckmann, Ludwig Fulda, author Victor Serge and prize-winning author Vladimir Nabokov, who although not Jewish himself, was married to a Jewish woman. Russian author Victor Serge described many of the people living temporarily in Marseille who were waiting to emigrate to the US:

After prodding by their daughter Ida, who &quot;perceived the need to act fast&quot;, and with help from Alfred Barr of the New York Museum of Modern Art, Chagall was saved by having his name added to the list of prominent artists whose lives were at risk and who the United States should try to extricate. Varian Fry, the US journalist, and Hiram Bingham IV, the US Vice-Consul in Marseilles, ran a rescue operation to smuggle artists and intellectuals out of Europe to the US by providing them with forged visas to the US. In April 1941, Chagall and his wife were stripped of their French citizenship. The Chagalls stayed at the Hotel Moderne in Marseille where they were arrested along with other Jews. Varian Fry managed to pressure the French police to release him, threatening them of scandal. Chagall was one of over 2,000 who were rescued by this operation. He left France in May 1941, &quot;when it was almost too late&quot;, adds Lewis. Picasso and Matisse were also invited to come to the US but they decided to remain in France. On 10 June 1941 Chagall and Bella left Lisbon aboard the Portuguese ship &quot;Mouzinho&quot;. The passengers included 119 refugee children, to whom Chagall gave drawing lessons on the voyage. The ship reached Staten Island on 21 June, the day before Germany invaded the Soviet Union. Ida and her husband Michel followed on the notorious refugee ship with a large case of Chagall&#x27;s work. A chance post-war meeting in a French café between Ida and intelligence analyst Konrad Kellen led to Kellen carrying more paintings on his return to the United States.

===United States (1941–1948)===

Even before arriving in the United States in 1941, Chagall was awarded the Carnegie Prize third prize in 1939 for &quot;Les Fiancés&quot;. After being in the US he discovered that he had already achieved &quot;international stature&quot;, writes Cogniat, although he felt ill-suited in this new role in a foreign country whose language he could not yet speak. He became a celebrity mostly against his will, feeling lost in the strange surroundings.

After a while he began to settle in New York, which was full of writers, painters, and composers who, like himself, had fled from Europe during the Nazi invasions. He lived at 4 East 74th Street. He spent time visiting galleries and museums, and befriended other artists including Piet Mondrian and André Breton.

Baal-Teshuva writes that Chagall &quot;loved&quot; going to the sections of New York where Jews lived, especially the Lower East Side. There he felt at home, enjoying the Jewish foods and being able to read the Yiddish press, which became his main source of information since he did not yet speak English.

Contemporary artists did not yet understand or even like Chagall&#x27;s art. According to Baal-Teshuva, &quot;they had little in common with a folkloristic storyteller of Russo-Jewish extraction with a propensity for mysticism.&quot; The Paris School, which was referred to as &#x27;Parisian Surrealism&#x27;, meant little to them. Those attitudes would begin to change, however, when Pierre Matisse, the son of recognized French artist Henri Matisse, became his representative and managed Chagall exhibitions in New York and Chicago in 1941. One of the earliest exhibitions included 21 of his masterpieces from 1910 to 1941. Art critic Henry McBride wrote about this exhibit for the &quot;New York Sun&quot;:

====&quot;Aleko&quot; ballet (1942)====
He was offered a commission by choreographer Léonide Massine of the Ballet Theatre of New York to design the sets and costumes for his new ballet, &quot;Aleko&quot;. This ballet would stage the words of Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s verse narrative &quot;The Gypsies&quot; with the music of Tchaikovsky. The ballet was originally planned for a New York debut, but as a cost-saving measure it was moved to Mexico where labor costs were cheaper than in New York. While Chagall had done stage settings before while in Russia, this was his first ballet, and it would give him the opportunity to visit Mexico. While there, he quickly began to appreciate the &quot;primitive ways and colorful art of the Mexicans&quot;, notes Cogniat. He found &quot;something very closely related to his own nature&quot;, and did all the color detail for the sets while there. Eventually, he created four large backdrops and had Mexican seamstresses sew the ballet costumes.

When the ballet premiered at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City on 8 September 1942 it was considered a &quot;remarkable success&quot;. In the audience were other famous mural painters who came to see Chagall&#x27;s work, including Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco. According to Baal-Teshuva, when the final bar of music ended, &quot;there was a tumultuous applause and 19 curtain calls, with Chagall himself being called back onto the stage again and again.&quot; The production then moved to New York, where it was presented four weeks later at the Metropolitan Opera and the response was repeated, &quot;again Chagall was the hero of the evening&quot;. Art critic Edwin Denby wrote of the opening for the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; that Chagall&#x27;s work:

====Coming to grips with World War II====

After Chagall returned to New York in 1943 current events began to interest him more, and this was represented by his art, where he painted subjects including the Crucifixion and scenes of war. He learned that the Germans had destroyed the town where he was raised, Vitebsk, and became greatly distressed. He also learned about the Nazi concentration camps. During a speech in February 1944, he described some of his feelings:

In the same speech he credited Soviet Russia with doing the most to save the Jews:

On 2 September 1944, Bella died suddenly due to a streptococcus infection, which could not be treated at the Mercy General Hospital as they had no penicillin due to wartime restrictions. As a result, he stopped all work for many months, and when he did resume painting his first pictures were concerned with preserving Bella&#x27;s memory. Wullschlager writes of the effect on Chagall: &quot;As news poured in through 1945 of the ongoing Holocaust at Nazi concentration camps, Bella took her place in Chagall&#x27;s mind with the millions of Jewish victims.&quot; He even considered the possibility that their &quot;exile from Europe had sapped her will to live&quot;.

After a year of living with his daughter Ida and her husband Michel Gordey, he entered into a romance with Virginia Haggard, daughter of diplomat Godfrey Haggard and great-niece of the author H. Rider Haggard; their relationship endured seven years. They had a child together, David McNeil, born 22 June 1946. Haggard recalled her &quot;seven years of plenty&quot; with Chagall in her book, &quot;My Life with Chagall&quot; (Robert Hale, 1986).

A few months after the Allies succeeded in liberating Paris from Nazi occupation, with the help of the Allied armies, Chagall published a letter in a Paris weekly, &quot;To the Paris Artists&quot;:

====Post-war years====
By 1946, his artwork was becoming more widely recognized. The Museum of Modern Art in New York had a large exhibition representing 40 years of his work which gave visitors one of the first complete impressions of the changing nature of his art over the years. The war had ended and he began making plans to return to Paris. According to Cogniat, &quot;He found he was even more deeply attached than before, not only to the atmosphere of Paris, but to the city itself, to its houses and its views.&quot; Chagall summed up his years living in the US:

He went back to France for good during the autumn of 1947, where he attended the opening of the exhibition of his works at the Musée National d&#x27;Art Moderne.

===France (1948–1985)===
After returning to France he traveled throughout Europe and chose to live in the Côte d&#x27;Azur which by that time had become somewhat of an &quot;artistic centre&quot;. Matisse lived near Saint-Paul-de-Vence, about seven miles west of Nice, while Picasso lived in Vallauris. Although they lived nearby and sometimes worked together, there was artistic rivalry between them as their work was so distinctly different, and they never became long-term friends. According to Picasso&#x27;s mistress, Françoise Gilot, Picasso still had a great deal of respect for Chagall, and once told her,

In April 1952, Virginia Haggard left Chagall for the photographer Charles Leirens; she went on to become a professional photographer herself.
Chagall&#x27;s daughter Ida married art historian Franz Meyer in January 1952, and feeling that her father missed the companionship of a woman in his home, introduced him to Valentina (Vava) Brodsky, a woman from a similar Russian Jewish background, who had run a successful millinery business in London. She became his secretary, and after a few months agreed to stay only if Chagall married her. The marriage took place in July 1952—though six years later, when there was conflict between Ida and Vava, &quot;Marc and Vava divorced and immediately remarried under an agreement more favourable to Vava&quot; (Jean-Paul Crespelle, author of &quot;Chagall, l&#x27;Amour le Reve et la Vie&quot;, quoted in &quot;Haggard: My Life with Chagall&quot;).

In 1954, he was engaged as set decorator for Robert Helpmann&#x27;s production of Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s opera &quot;Le Coq d&#x27;Or&quot; at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, but he withdrew. The Australian designer Loudon Sainthill was drafted at short notice in his place.

In the years ahead he was able to produce not just paintings and graphic art, but also numerous sculptures and ceramics, including wall tiles, painted vases, plates and jugs. He also began working in larger-scale formats, producing large murals, stained glass windows, mosaics and tapestries.

====Ceiling of the Paris Opera (1963)====

In 1963, Chagall was commissioned to paint the new ceiling for the Paris Opera (Palais Garnier), a majestic 19th-century building and national monument. André Malraux, France&#x27;s Minister of Culture wanted something unique and decided Chagall would be the ideal artist. However, this choice of artist caused controversy: some objected to having a Russian Jew decorate a French national monument; others disliked the ceiling of the historic building being painted by a modern artist. Some magazines wrote condescending articles about Chagall and Malraux, about which Chagall commented to one writer:

Nonetheless, Chagall continued the project, which took the 77-year-old artist a year to complete. The final canvas was nearly 2,400 square feet (220 sq. meters) and required of paint. It had five sections which were glued to polyester panels and hoisted up to the ceiling. The images Chagall painted on the canvas paid tribute to the composers Mozart, Wagner, Mussorgsky, Berlioz and Ravel, as well as to famous actors and dancers.

It was presented to the public on 23 September 1964 in the presence of Malraux and 2,100 invited guests. The Paris correspondent for the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;For once the best seats were in the uppermost circle: Baal-Teshuva writes:

After the new ceiling was unveiled, &quot;even the bitterest opponents of the commission seemed to fall silent&quot;, writes Baal-Teshuva. &quot;Unanimously, the press declared Chagall&#x27;s new work to be a great contribution to French culture.&quot; Malraux later said, &quot;What other living artist could have painted the ceiling of the Paris Opera in the way Chagall did?... He is above all one of the great colourists of our time... many of his canvases and the Opera ceiling represent sublime images that rank among the finest poetry of our time, just as Titian produced the finest poetry of his day.&quot; In Chagall&#x27;s speech to the audience he explained the meaning of the work:

==Art styles and techniques==

===Color===

According to Cogniat, in all Chagall&#x27;s work during all stages of his life, it was his colors which attracted and captured the viewer&#x27;s attention. During his earlier years his range was limited by his emphasis on form and his pictures never gave the impression of painted drawings. He adds, &quot;The colors are a living, integral part of the picture and are never passively flat, or banal like an afterthought. They sculpt and animate the volume of the shapes... they indulge in flights of fancy and invention which add new perspectives and graduated, blended tones... His colors do not even attempt to imitate nature but rather to suggest movements, planes and rhythms.&quot;

He was able to convey striking images using only two or three colors. Cogniat writes, &quot;Chagall is unrivalled in this ability to give a vivid impression of explosive movement with the simplest use of colors...&quot; Throughout his life his colors created a &quot;vibrant atmosphere&quot; which was based on &quot;his own personal vision.&quot;

===Subject matter===

====From life memories to fantasy====
Chagall&#x27;s early life left him with a &quot;powerful visual memory and a pictorial intelligence&quot;, writes Goodman. After living in France and experiencing the atmosphere of artistic freedom, his &quot;vision soared and he created a new reality, one that drew on both his inner and outer worlds.&quot; But it was the images and memories of his early years in Belarus that would sustain his art for more than 70 years.
According to Cogniat, there are certain elements in his art that have remained permanent and seen throughout his career. One of those was his choice of subjects and the way they were portrayed. &quot;The most obviously constant element is his gift for happiness and his instinctive compassion, which even in the most serious subjects prevents him from dramatization...&quot; Musicians have been a constant during all stages of his work. After he first got married, &quot;lovers have sought each other, embraced, caressed, floated through the air, met in wreaths of flowers, stretched, and swooped like the melodious passage of their vivid day-dreams. Acrobats contort themselves with the grace of exotic flowers on the end of their stems; flowers and foliage abound everywhere.&quot; Wullschlager explains the sources for these images:

Chagall described his love of circus people:

His early pictures were often of the town where he was born and raised, Vitebsk. Cogniat notes that they are realistic and give the impression of firsthand experience by capturing a moment in time with action, often with a dramatic image. During his later years, as for instance in the &quot;Bible series&quot;, subjects were more dramatic. He managed to blend the real with the fantastic, and combined with his use of color the pictures were always at least acceptable if not powerful. He never attempted to present pure reality but always created his atmospheres through fantasy. In all cases Chagall&#x27;s &quot;most persistent subject is life itself, in its simplicity or its hidden complexity... He presents for our study places, people, and objects from his own life&quot;.

====Jewish themes====
After absorbing the techniques of Fauvism and Cubism (under the influence of Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes) Chagall was able to blend these stylistic tendencies with his own folkish style. He gave the grim life of Hasidic Jews the &quot;romantic overtones of a charmed world&quot;, notes Goodman. It was by combining the aspects of Modernism with his &quot;unique artistic language&quot;, that he was able to catch the attention of critics and collectors throughout Europe. Generally, it was his boyhood of living in a Belarusian provincial town that gave him a continual source of imaginative stimuli. Chagall would become one of many Jewish émigrés who later became noted artists, all of them similarly having once been part of &quot;Russia&#x27;s most numerous and creative minorities&quot;, notes Goodman.

World War I, which ended in 1918, had displaced nearly a million Jews and destroyed most of what remained of the provincial shtetl culture that had defined life for most Eastern European Jews for centuries. Goodman notes, &quot;The fading of traditional Jewish society left artists like Chagall with powerful memories that could no longer be fed by a tangible reality. Instead, that culture became an emotional and intellectual source that existed solely in memory and the imagination... So rich had the experience been, it sustained him for the rest of his life.&quot; Sweeney adds that &quot;if you ask Chagall to explain his paintings, he would reply, &#x27;I don&#x27;t understand them at all. They are not literature. They are only pictorial arrangements of images that obsess me...&quot;

In 1948, after returning to France from the U.S. after the war, he saw for himself the destruction that the war had brought to Europe and the Jewish populations. In 1951, as part of a memorial book dedicated to eighty-four Jewish artists who were killed by the Nazis in France, he wrote a poem entitled &quot;For the Slaughtered Artists: 1950&quot;, which inspired paintings such as the &quot;Song of David&quot; (see photo):

Lewis writes that Chagall &quot;remains the most important visual artist to have borne witness to the world of East European Jewry... and inadvertently became the public witness of a now vanished civilization.&quot; Although Judaism has religious inhibitions about pictorial art of many religious subjects, Chagall managed to use his fantasy images as a form of visual metaphor combined with folk imagery. His &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;, for example, combines a folksy village setting with a fiddler as a way to show the Jewish love of music as important to the Jewish spirit.

Music played an important role in shaping the subjects of his work. While he later came to love the music of Bach and Mozart, during his youth he was mostly influenced by the music within the Hasidic community where he was raised. Art historian Franz Meyer points out that one of the main reasons for the unconventional nature of his work is related to the hassidism which inspired the world of his childhood and youth and had actually impressed itself on most Eastern European Jews since the 18th century. He writes, &quot;For Chagall this is one of the deepest sources, not of inspiration, but of a certain spiritual attitude... the hassidic spirit is still the basis and source of nourishment of his art.&quot; In a talk that Chagall gave in 1963 while visiting the US, he discussed some of those impressions.

However, Chagall had a complex relationship with Judaism. On the one hand, he credited his Russian Jewish cultural background as being crucial to his artistic imagination. But however ambivalent he was about his religion, he could not avoid drawing upon his Jewish past for artistic material. As an adult, he was not a practicing Jew, but through his paintings and stained glass, he continually tried to suggest a more &quot;universal message&quot;, using both Jewish and Christian themes.

He was also at pains to distance his work from a single Jewish focus. At the opening of The Chagall Museum in Nice he said &#x27;My painting represents not the dream of one people but of all humanity&#x27;.

==Other types of art==

===Stained glass windows===
One of Chagall&#x27;s major contributions to art has been his work with stained glass. This medium allowed him further to express his desire to create intense and fresh colors and had the added benefit of natural light and refraction interacting and constantly changing: everything from the position where the viewer stood to the weather outside would alter the visual effect (though this is not the case with his Hadassah windows). It was not until 1956, when he was nearly 70 years of age, that he designed windows for the Église Notre-Dame de Toute Grâce du Plateau d&#x27;Assy, his first major project. Then, from 1958 to 1960, he created windows for Metz Cathedral.

==== Jerusalem Windows (1962) ====

In 1960, he began creating stained glass windows for the synagogue of Hebrew University&#x27;s Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. Leymarie writes that &quot;in order to illuminate the synagogue both spiritually and physically&quot;, it was decided that the twelve windows, representing the twelve tribes of Israel, were to be filled with stained glass. Chagall envisaged the synagogue as &quot;a crown offered to the Jewish Queen&quot;, and the windows as &quot;jewels of translucent fire&quot;, she writes. Chagall then devoted the next two years to the task, and upon completion in 1961 the windows were exhibited in Paris and then the Museum of Modern Art in New York. They were installed permanently in Jerusalem in February 1962. Each of the twelve windows is approximately 11 feet high and wide, much larger than anything he had done before. Cogniat considers them to be &quot;his greatest work in the field of stained glass&quot;, although Virginia Haggard McNeil records Chagall&#x27;s disappointment that they were to be lit with artificial light, and so would not change according to the conditions of natural light.
French philosopher Gaston Bachelard commented that &quot;Chagall reads the Bible and suddenly the passages become light.&quot; In 1973 Israel released a 12-stamp set with images of the stained-glass windows.

The windows symbolize the twelve tribes of Israel who were blessed by Jacob and Moses in the verses which conclude Genesis and Deuteronomy. In those books, notes Leymarie, &quot;The dying Moses repeated Jacob&#x27;s solemn act and, in a somewhat different order, also blessed the twelve tribes of Israel who were about to enter the land of Canaan... In the synagogue, where the windows are distributed in the same way, the tribes form a symbolic guard of honor around the tabernacle.&quot; Leymarie describes the physical and spiritual significance of the windows:

At the dedication ceremony in 1962, Chagall described his feelings about the windows:

==== &quot;Peace&quot;, United Nations building (1964) ====

In 1964 Chagall created a stained-glass window, entitled &quot;Peace&quot;, for the UN in honor of Dag Hammarskjöld, the UN&#x27;s second secretary general who was killed in an airplane crash in Northern Rhodesia in 1961. The window is about wide and high and contains symbols of peace and love along with musical symbols. In 1967 he dedicated a stained-glass window to John D. Rockefeller in the Union Church of Pocantico Hills, New York.

==== Fraumünster in Zurich, Switzerland (1967) ====

The Fraumünster church in Zurich, Switzerland, founded in 853, is known for its five large stained glass windows created by Chagall in 1967. Each window is tall by wide. Religion historian James H. Charlesworth notes that it is &quot;surprising how Christian symbols are featured in the works of an artist who comes from a strict and Orthodox Jewish background.&quot; He surmises that Chagall, as a result of his Russian background, often used Russian icons in his paintings, with their interpretations of Christian symbols. He explains that his chosen themes were usually derived from biblical stories, and frequently portrayed the &quot;obedience and suffering of God&#x27;s chosen people.&quot; One of the panels depicts Moses receiving the Torah, with rays of light from his head. At the top of another panel is a depiction of Jesus&#x27; crucifixion.

==== St Stephan&#x27;s church in Mainz, Germany (1978) ====

In 1978 he began creating windows for St Stephan&#x27;s church in Mainz, Germany. Today, 200,000 visitors a year visit the church, and &quot;tourists from the whole world pilgrim up St Stephan&#x27;s Mount, to see the glowing blue stained glass windows by the artist Marc Chagall&quot;, states the city&#x27;s web site. &quot;St Stephan&#x27;s is the only German church for which Chagall has created windows.&quot;

The website also notes, &quot;The colours address our vital consciousness directly, because they tell of optimism, hope and delight in life&quot;, says Monsignor Klaus Mayer, who imparts Chagall&#x27;s work in mediations and books. He corresponded with Chagall during 1973, and succeeded in persuading the &quot;master of colour and the biblical message&quot; to create a sign for Jewish-Christian attachment and international understanding. Centuries earlier Mainz had been &quot;the capital of European Jewry&quot;, and contained the largest Jewish community in Europe, notes historian John Man. In 1978, at the age of 91, Chagall created the first window and eight more followed. Chagall&#x27;s collaborator Charles Marq complemented Chagall&#x27;s work by adding several stained glass windows using the typical colors of Chagall.

==== All Saints Church, Tudeley, UK (1963–1978) ====

All Saints Church, Tudeley, is the only church in the world to have all its twelve windows decorated by Chagall. The other three religious buildings with complete sets of Chagall windows are the Hadassah Medical Center synagogue, the Chapel of Le Saillant, Limousin, and the Union Church of Pocantico Hills, New York.

The windows at Tudeley were commissioned by Sir Henry and Lady Rosemary d&#x27;Avigdor-Goldsmid as a memorial tribute to their daughter Sarah, who died in 1963 aged 21 in a sailing accident off Rye. When Chagall arrived for the dedication of the east window in 1967, and saw the church for the first time, he exclaimed &quot;&quot; (&quot;It&#x27;s beautiful! I will do them all!&quot;) Over the next ten years Chagall designed the remaining eleven windows, made again in collaboration with the glassworker Charles Marq in his workshop at Reims in northern France. The last windows were installed in 1985, just before Chagall&#x27;s death.

==== Chichester Cathedral, West Sussex, UK ====

On the north side of Chichester Cathedral there is a stained glass window designed and created by Chagall at the age of 90. The window, his last commissioned work, was inspired by Psalm 150; &#x27;Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord&#x27; at the suggestion of Dean Walter Hussey. The window was unveiled by the Duchess of Kent in 1978.

==== America Windows, Chicago ====
Chagall visited Chicago in the early 1970s to install his mural &quot;The Four Seasons&quot;, and at that time was inspired to create a set of stained glass windows for the Art Institute of Chicago. After discussions with the Art Institute and further reflection, Chagall made the windows a tribute to the American Bicentennial, and in particular the commitment of the United States to cultural and religious freedom. The windows appeared prominently in the 1986 movie &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;. From 2005 to 2010, the windows were moved due to nearby construction on a new wing of the Art Institute, and for archival cleaning.

===Murals, theatre sets and costumes===
Chagall first worked on stage designs in 1914 while living in Russia, under the inspiration of the theatrical designer and artist Léon Bakst. It was during this period in the Russian theatre that formerly static ideas of stage design were, according to Cogniat, &quot;being swept away in favor of a wholly arbitrary sense of space with different dimensions, perspectives, colors and rhythms.&quot; These changes appealed to Chagall who had been experimenting with Cubism and wanted a way to enliven his images. Designing murals and stage designs, Chagall&#x27;s &quot;dreams sprang to life and became an actual movement.&quot;

As a result, Chagall played an important role in Russian artistic life during that time and &quot;was one of the most important forces in the current urge towards anti-realism&quot; which helped the new Russia invent &quot;astonishing&quot; creations. Many of his designs were done for the Jewish Theatre in Moscow which put on numerous Jewish plays by playwrights such as Gogol and Singe. Chagall&#x27;s set designs helped create illusory atmospheres which became the essence of the theatrical performances.

After leaving Russia, twenty years passed before he was again offered a chance to design theatre sets. In the years between, his paintings still included harlequins, clowns and acrobats, which Cogniat notes &quot;convey his sentimental attachment to and nostalgia for the theatre&quot;. His first assignment designing sets after Russia was for the ballet &quot;Aleko&quot; in 1942, while living in the US. In 1945 he was also commissioned to design the sets and costumes for Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Firebird&quot;. These designs contributed greatly towards his enhanced reputation in the US as a major artist and, as of 2013, are still in use by New York City Ballet.

Cogniat describes how Chagall&#x27;s designs &quot;immerse the spectator in a luminous, colored fairy-land where forms are mistily defined and the spaces themselves seem animated with whirlwinds or explosions.&quot; His technique of using theatrical color in this way reached its peak when Chagall returned to Paris and designed the sets for Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Daphnis et Chloé&quot; in 1958.

In 1964 he repainted the ceiling of the Paris Opera using of canvas. He painted two monumental murals which hang on opposite sides of the new Metropolitan Opera house at Lincoln Center in New York which opened in 1966. The pieces, &quot;The Sources of Music&quot; and &quot;The Triumph of Music&quot;, which hang from the top-most balcony level and extend down to the Grand Tier lobby level, were completed in France and shipped to New York, and are covered by a system of panels during the hours in which the opera house receives direct sunlight to prevent fading. He also designed the sets and costumes for a new production of &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; for the company which opened in February 1967 and was used through the 1981/1982 season.

===Tapestries===

Chagall also designed tapestries which were woven under the direction of Yvette Cauquil-Prince, who also collaborated with Picasso. These tapestries are much rarer than his paintings, with only 40 of them ever reaching the commercial market. Chagall designed three tapestries for the state hall of the Knesset in Israel, along with 12-floor mosaics and a wall mosaic.

===Ceramics and sculpture===
Chagall began learning about ceramics and sculpture while living in south France. Ceramics became a fashion in the Côte d&#x27;Azur with various workshops starting up at Antibes, Vence and Vallauris. He took classes along with other known artists including Picasso and Fernand Léger. At first Chagall painted existing pieces of pottery but soon expanded into designing his own, which began his work as a sculptor as a complement to his painting.

After experimenting with pottery and dishes he moved into large ceramic murals. However, he was never satisfied with the limits imposed by the square tile segments which Cogniat notes &quot;imposed on him a discipline which prevented the creation of a plastic image.&quot;

==Final years and death==
Author Serena Davies writes that &quot;By the time he died in France in 1985—the last surviving master of European modernism, outliving Joan Miró by two years—he had experienced at first hand the high hopes and crushing disappointments of the Russian Revolution, and had witnessed the end of the Pale of Settlement, the near annihilation of European Jewry, and the obliteration of Vitebsk, his home town, where only 118 of a population of 240,000 survived the Second World War.&quot;

Chagall&#x27;s final work was a commissioned piece of art for the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago. The maquette painting titled &quot;Job&quot; had been completed, but Chagall died just before the completion of the tapestry.
Yvette Cauquil-Prince was weaving the tapestry under Chagall&#x27;s supervision and was the last person to work with Chagall. She left Vava and Marc Chagall&#x27;s home at 4 pm on 28 March after discussing and matching the final colors from the maquette painting for the tapestry. He died that evening.

His relationship with his Jewish identity was &quot;unresolved and tragic&quot;, Davies states. He would have died without Jewish rites, had not a Jewish stranger stepped forward and said the kaddish, the Jewish prayer for the dead, over his coffin. Chagall is buried alongside his last wife Valentina &quot;Vava&quot; Brodsky Chagall, in the multi-denominational cemetery in the traditional artists&#x27; town of Saint-Paul-de-Vence, in the French region of Provence.&#x27;

==Gallery==

== Catalogue raisonné ==
An online catalogue raisonné of the artist, in progress, was initiated in 2019 by the Association des Amis de Marc Chagall under the direction of Ambre Gauthier, in conjunction with the Archives Marc et Ida Chagall and the Marc Chagall Committee. Its online publication began in 2023 with the 97 sculptures made by Marc Chagall, then in 2024 with the addition of his 350 ceramics.

==Legacy and influence==
Chagall biographer Jackie Wullschlager praises him as a &quot;pioneer of modern art and one of its greatest figurative painters... [who] invented a visual language that recorded the thrill and terror of the twentieth century.&quot; She adds:

Art historians Ingo Walther and Rainer Metzger refer to Chagall as a &quot;poet, dreamer, and exotic apparition.&quot; They add that throughout his long life the &quot;role of outsider and artistic eccentric&quot; came naturally to him, as he seemed to be a kind of intermediary between worlds: &quot;as a Jew with a lordly disdain for the ancient ban on image-making; as a Russian who went beyond the realm of familiar self-sufficiency; or the son of poor parents, growing up in a large and needy family.&quot; Yet he went on to establish himself in the sophisticated world of &quot;elegant artistic salons.&quot;

Through his imagination and strong memories Chagall was able to use typical motifs and subjects in most of his work: village scenes, peasant life, and intimate views of the small world of the Jewish village (shtetl). His tranquil figures and simple gestures helped produce a &quot;monumental sense of dignity&quot; by translating everyday Jewish rituals into a &quot;timeless realm of iconic peacefulness&quot;. Leymarie writes that Chagall &quot;transcended the limits of his century. He has unveiled possibilities unsuspected by an art that had lost touch with the Bible, and in doing so he has achieved a wholly new synthesis of Jewish culture long ignored by painting.&quot; He adds that although Chagall&#x27;s art cannot be confined to religion, his &quot;most moving and original contributions, what he called &#x27;his message&#x27;, are those drawn from religious or, more precisely, Biblical sources.&quot;

Walther and Metzger try to summarize Chagall&#x27;s contribution to art:

André Malraux praised him. He said: &quot;[Chagall] is the greatest image-maker of this century. He has looked at our world with the light of freedom, and seen it with the colours of love.&quot;

===Art market===
A 1928 Chagall oil painting, &quot;Les Amoureux&quot;, measuring 117.3 x 90.5 cm, depicting Bella Rosenfeld, the artist&#x27;s first wife and adopted home Paris, sold for $28.5 million (with fees) at Sotheby&#x27;s New York, 14 November 2017, almost doubling Chagall&#x27;s 27-year-old $14.85 million auction record.

In October 2010, his painting &quot;Bestiaire et Musique&quot;, depicting a bride and a fiddler floating in a night sky amid circus performers and animals, &quot;was the star lot&quot; at an auction in Hong Kong. When it sold for $4.1 million, it became the most expensive contemporary Western painting ever sold in Asia.

== Nazi-loot and restitution cases ==
The earliest court case in the United States related to Nazi-looted art involved a painting by Chagall, called variously &quot;L&#x27;Echelle de Jacob&quot; or &quot;Le Paysan et l&#x27;Echelle&quot; or &quot;The Peasant and the Ladder&quot; or &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder,&quot; which had been seized by the Einsatzstab Rosenberg (ERR) Nazi looting organisation from the Menzel apartment in Brussels in 1941 after the Jewish family fled the Nazis&quot;.&quot; In 1969 the widow Erna Menzel sued the US art collector Albert A. List, who had bought the painting from Perls Galleries in New York in 1955. In Menzel v List, the court awarded the Chagall painting to Menzel and ordered Klaus Perls to pay List the appreciated value of the painting. 

In 2013, previously unknown works by Chagall were discovered in the stash of artworks hidden away by the son of one of Hitler&#x27;s art dealers, Hildebrand Gurlitt. Chagall&#x27;s &quot;Allegorical Scene&quot; was identified as having come from the collection of Savely Blumestein.

In 2022 France restituted &quot;The Father (Le Père)&quot; to the heirs of David Cender, a Polish-Jewish violin maker and luthier who survived Auschwitz where his wife and daughter were killed. According to the French culture ministry, Chagall had repurchased his own painting after the war not knowing its provenance, before it was donated to the French national collections in 1988.

In February 2024, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that the Museum of Modern Art in New York (MoMa) had secretly restituted Chagall&#x27;s &quot;Over Vitebsk&quot; to the heirs of Franz Matthiesen in 2021, and that the restitution involved a $4 million payment to the museum. The painting had passed through the Nazi dealer Kurt Feldhausser and the Wehye Gallery and its provenance was disputed.

==Theatre==
In the 1990s, Daniel Jamieson wrote &quot;The Flying Lovers of Vitebsk&quot;, a play concerning the life of Chagall and partner Bella. It has been revived multiple times, most recently in 2020 with Emma Rice directing a production which was live-streamed from the Bristol Old Vic and then made available for on-demand viewing, in partnership with theaters around the world. This production had Marc Antolin in the role of Chagall and Audrey Brisson playing Bella Chagall; produced during the COVID epidemic, it required the entire crew to quarantine together to make the live performance and broadcast possible.

In 2022, James Sherman wrote &quot;Chagall in School&quot;, a play concerning Chagall&#x27;s leadership of the Vitebsk Art College. It premiered in Chicago at Theatre Wit with Georgette Verdin directing a production by Grippo Theatre Company. This production had John Drea in the role of Chagall and Yourtana Sulaiman playing Berta (Bella) Chagall. The production was well-received, with designer Erin Pleake winning a Non-Equity Jeff Award for Projection Design.

;1963 documentary
&quot;Chagall&quot;, a short 1963 documentary, features Chagall. It won the 1964 Academy Award for Best Short Subject Documentary.

;Postage stamp tributes
Because of the international acclaim he enjoyed and the popularity of his art, a number of countries have issued commemorative stamps in his honor depicting examples from his works. In 1963 France issued a stamp of his painting, &quot;The Married Couple of the Eiffel Tower&quot;. In 1969, Israel produced a stamp depicting his &quot;King David&quot; painting. In 1973 Israel released a 12-stamp set with images of the stained-glass windows that he created for the Hadassah Hebrew University Medical Center Synagogue; each window was made to signify one of the &quot;Twelve Tribes of Israel&quot;.

In 1987, as a tribute to recognize the centennial of his birth in Belarus, seven nations engaged in a special omnibus program and released postage stamps in his honor. The countries which issued the stamps included Antigua &amp; Barbuda, Dominica, The Gambia, Ghana, Sierra Leone and Grenada, which together produced 48 stamps and 10 souvenir sheets. Although the stamps all portray his various masterpieces, the names of the artwork are not listed on the stamps.

;Exhibitions
There were also several major exhibitions of Chagall&#x27;s work during his lifetime and following his death.
* In 1967, the Louvre in Paris exhibited 17 large-scale paintings and 38 gouaches, under the title of &quot;Message Biblique&quot;, which he donated to the nation of France on condition that a museum was to be built for them in Nice. In 1969 work began on the museum, named &quot;Musée National Message Biblique Marc Chagall&quot;. It was completed and inaugurated on 7 July 1973, on Chagall&#x27;s birthday. Today it contains monumental paintings on biblical themes, three stained-glass windows, tapestries, a large mosaic and numerous gouaches for the &quot;Bible series.&quot;
* From 1969 to 1970, the Grand Palais in Paris held the largest Chagall exhibition to date, including 474 works. The exhibition was called &quot;Hommage a Marc Chagall&quot;, was opened by the French President and &quot;proved an enormous success with the public and critics alike.&quot;
* The Dynamic Museum in Dakar, Senegal held an exhibition of his work in 1971.
* In 1973, he traveled to the Soviet Union, his first visit back since he left in 1922. The Tretiakov Gallery in Moscow had a special exhibition for the occasion of his visit. He was able to see again the murals he long ago made for the Jewish Theatre. In St. Petersburg, he was reunited with two of his sisters, whom he had not seen for more than 50 years.
* In 1982, the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, Sweden organized a retrospective exhibition which later traveled to Denmark.

<text>The picaresque novel (Spanish: &quot;picaresca&quot;, from &quot;pícaro&quot;, for &#x27;rogue&#x27; or &#x27;rascal&#x27;) is a genre of prose fiction. It depicts the adventures of a roguish but &quot;appealing hero&quot;, usually of low social class, who lives by his wits in a corrupt society. Picaresque novels typically adopt the form of &quot;an episodic prose narrative&quot; with a realistic style. There are often some elements of comedy and satire. 

Although the term &quot;picaresque novel&quot; was coined in 1810, the picaresque genre began with the Spanish novel &quot;Lazarillo de Tormes&quot; (1554), which was published anonymously during the Spanish Golden Age because of its anticlerical content. Literary works from Imperial Rome published during the 1st–2nd century AD, such as &quot;Satyricon&quot; by Petronius and &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; by Apuleius had a relevant influence on the picaresque genre and are considered predecessors. Other notable early Spanish contributors to the genre included Mateo Alemán&#x27;s &quot;Guzmán de Alfarache&quot; (1599–1604) and Francisco de Quevedo&#x27;s &quot;El Buscón&quot; (1626). Some other ancient influences of the picaresque genre include Roman playwrights such as Plautus and Terence. &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; by Apuleius nevertheless remains, according to different scholars such as F. W. Chandler, A. Marasso, T. Somerville and T. Bodenmüller, the primary antecedent influence for the picaresque genre. Subsequently, following the example of Spanish writers, the genre flourished throughout Europe for more than 200 years and it continues to have an influence on modern literature and fiction.
==Defined==
According to the traditional view of Thrall and Hibbard (first published in 1936), seven qualities distinguish the picaresque novel or narrative form, all or some of which an author may employ for effect:

* A picaresque narrative is usually written in first person as an autobiographical account. 
* The main character is often of low character or social class. They get by with wits and rarely deign to hold a job. 
* There is little or no plot. The story is told in a series of loosely connected adventures or episodes. 
* There is little if any character development in the main character. Once a pícaro, always a pícaro. Their circumstances may change but these rarely result in a change of heart. 
* The pícaro&#x27;s story is told with a plainness of language or realism. 
* Satire is sometimes a prominent element. 
* The behavior of a picaresque protagonist stops just short of criminality. Carefree or immoral rascality positions the picaresque hero as a sympathetic outsider, untouched by the false rules of society.

In the English-speaking world, the term &quot;picaresque&quot; is often used loosely to refer to novels that contain some elements of this genre; e.g. an episodic recounting of adventures on the road. The term is also sometimes used to describe works which only contain some of the genre&#x27;s elements, such as Miguel de Cervantes&#x27; &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (1605 and 1615), or Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; (1836–1837).

===Etymology===
The word &quot;&quot; first starts to appear in Spain with the current meaning in 1545, though at the time it had no association with literature. The word &quot;pícaro&quot; does not appear in &quot;Lazarillo de Tormes&quot; (1554), the novella credited by modern scholars with founding the genre. The expression &quot;picaresque novel&quot; was coined in 1810. Whether it has any validity at all as a generic label in the Spanish sixteenth and seventeenth centuries—Cervantes certainly used &quot;picaresque&quot; with a different meaning than it has today—has been called into question. There is unresolved debate within Hispanic studies about what the term means, or meant, and which works were, or should be, so called. The only work clearly called &quot;picaresque&quot; by its contemporaries was Mateo Alemán&#x27;s &quot;Guzmán de Alfarache&quot; (1599–1604), which they considered &quot;El libro del pícaro&quot; (English: &quot;The Book of the Pícaro&quot;).

==History==

===&quot;Lazarillo de Tormes&quot; and its sources===
While elements of literature by Geoffrey Chaucer and Giovanni Boccaccio have a picaresque feel and may have contributed to the style, the modern picaresque begins with &quot;Lazarillo de Tormes&quot;, which was published anonymously in 1554 in Burgos, Medina del Campo, and Alcalá de Henares in Spain, and also in Antwerp, which at the time was under Spanish rule as a major city in the Spanish Netherlands. It is variously considered either the first picaresque novel or at least the antecedent of the genre.

The protagonist, Lázaro, lives by his wits in an effort to survive and succeed in an impoverished country full of hypocrisy. As a &quot;pícaro&quot; character, he is an alienated outsider, whose ability to expose and ridicule individuals compromised within society gives him a revolutionary stance. Lázaro states that the motivation for his writing is to communicate his experiences of overcoming deception, hypocrisy, and falsehood (&quot;engaño&quot;).

The character type draws on elements of characterization already present in Roman literature, especially Petronius&#x27; &quot;Satyricon&quot;. Lázaro shares some of the traits of the central figure of Encolpius, a former gladiator, though it is unlikely that the author had access to Petronius&#x27; work. From the comedies of Plautus, &quot;Lazarillo&quot; borrows the figure of the parasite and the supple slave. Other traits are taken from Apuleius&#x27; &quot;The Golden Ass&quot;. &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; and &quot;Satyricon&quot; are rare surviving samples of the &quot;Milesian tale&quot;, a popular genre in the classical world, and were revived and widely read in Renaissance Europe.
The principal episodes of &quot;Lazarillo&quot; are based on Arabic folktales that were well known to the Moorish inhabitants of Spain. The Arabic influence may account for the negative portrayal of priests and other church officials in &quot;Lazarillo&quot;. Arabic literature, which was read widely in Spain in the time of Al-Andalus and possessed a literary tradition with similar themes, is thus another possible influence on the picaresque style. Al-Hamadhani (d.1008) of Hamadhan (Iran) is credited with inventing the literary genre of &quot;maqāmāt&quot; in which a wandering vagabond makes his living on the gifts his listeners give him following his extemporaneous displays of rhetoric, erudition, or verse, often done with a trickster&#x27;s touch. Ibn al-Astarkuwi or al-Ashtarkuni (d.1134) also wrote in the genre &quot;maqāmāt&quot;, comparable to later European picaresque.

The curious presence of Russian loanwords in the text of the &quot;Lazarillo&quot; also suggests the influence of medieval Slavic tales of tricksters, thieves, itinerant prostitutes, and brigands, who were common figures in the impoverished areas bordering on Germany to the west. When diplomatic ties to Germany and Spain were established under the emperor Charles V, these tales began to be read in Italian translations in the Iberian Peninsula.

As narrator of his own adventures, Lázaro seeks to portray himself as the victim of both his ancestry and his circumstance. This means of appealing to the compassion of the reader would be directly challenged by later picaresque novels such as &quot;Guzmán de Alfarache&quot; (1599/1604) and &quot;El Buscón&quot; (composed in the first decade of the 17th century and first published in 1626) because the idea of determinism used to cast the &quot;pícaro&quot; as a victim clashed with the Catholic Revival doctrine of free will.

===Other initial works===

An early example is Mateo Alemán&#x27;s &quot;Guzmán de Alfarache&quot; (1599), characterized by religiosity. Guzmán de Alfarache is a fictional character who lived in the city of San Juan de Aznalfarache, in Seville, Spain.

Francisco de Quevedo&#x27;s &quot;El Buscón&quot; (1604 according to Francisco Rico; the exact date is uncertain, yet it was certainly a very early work) is considered the absolute masterpiece of the genre by A. A. Parker, because of his baroque style and the study of delinquent psychology. However, a different school of thought, led by Francisco Rico, rejects Parker&#x27;s view, contending instead that the protagonist is an unrealistic character and that—as the structure of the novel is radically different from previous works in the picaresque genre—Quevedo is using the form as a mere vehicle to show off his abilities with conceit and rhetoric (rather than to actually construct a satirical critique of Spanish Golden Age society).

Miguel de Cervantes wrote several works &quot;in the picaresque manner, notably &quot;Rinconete y Cortadillo&quot; (1613) and &quot;El coloquio de los perros&quot; (1613; &quot;Colloquy of the Dogs&quot;)&quot;. &quot;Cervantes also incorporated elements of the picaresque into his greatest novel, &quot;Don Quixote&quot; (1605, 1615)&quot;, the &quot;single most important progenitor of the modern novel&quot;, that M. H. Abrams has described as a &quot;quasi-picaresque narrative&quot;. Here the hero is not a rogue but a foolish knight.

In order to understand the historical context that led to the development of these paradigmatic picaresque novels in Spain during the 16th and 17th centuries, it is essential to take into consideration the circumstances surrounding the lives of &quot;conversos,&quot; whose ancestors had been Jewish, and whose New Christian faith was subjected to close scrutiny and mistrust.

The Spanish novels were read and imitated in other European countries where their influence can be found. In Germany, Hans Jakob Christoffel von Grimmelshausen wrote &quot;Simplicius Simplicissimus&quot; (1669), considered the most important of non-Spanish picaresque novels. It describes the devastation caused by the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Grimmelshausen&#x27;s novel has been called an example of the German &quot;abenteuerroman&quot; (which literally means &quot;adventure novel&quot;). An &quot;abenteuerroman&quot; is Germany&#x27;s version of the picaresque novel; it is an &quot;entertaining story of the adventures of the hero, but there is also often a serious aspect to the story.&quot;

Alain-René Le Sage&#x27;s &quot;Gil Blas&quot; (1715) is a classic example of the genre, which in France had declined into an aristocratic adventure. In Britain, the first example is Thomas Nashe&#x27;s &quot;The Unfortunate Traveller&quot; (1594) in which a court page, Jack Wilson, exposes the underclass life in a string of European cities through lively, often brutal descriptions. The body of Tobias Smollett&#x27;s work, and Daniel Defoe&#x27;s &quot;Moll Flanders&quot; (1722) are considered picaresque, but they lack the sense of religious redemption of delinquency that was very important in Spanish and German novels. The triumph of Moll Flanders is more economic than moral. While the mores of the early 18th century wouldn&#x27;t permit Moll to be a heroine &quot;per se&quot;, Defoe hardly disguises his admiration for her resilience and resourcefulness.

====Works with some picaresque elements====
The autobiography of Benvenuto Cellini, written in Florence beginning in 1558, also has much in common with the picaresque.

The classic Chinese novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot; is considered to have considerable picaresque elements. Having been published in 1590, it is contemporary with much of the above—but is unlikely to have been directly influenced by the European genre.

===18th and 19th centuries===
Henry Fielding proved his mastery of the form in &quot;Joseph Andrews&quot; (1742), &quot;The Life and Death of Jonathan Wild, the Great&quot; (1743) and &quot;The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling&quot; (1749), though Fielding attributed his style to an &quot;imitation of the manner of Cervantes, author of &quot;Don Quixote&quot;&quot;.

William Makepeace Thackeray is the master of the 19th-century English picaresque. His best-known work, &quot;Vanity Fair: A Novel Without a Hero&quot; (1847–1848) — a title ironically derived from John Bunyan&#x27;s Puritan allegory of redemption &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; (1678) — follows the career of fortune-hunting adventuress Becky Sharp, her progress echoing the earlier &quot;Moll Flanders&quot;. His earlier novel &quot;The Luck of Barry Lyndon&quot; (1844) recounts the rise and fall of an Irish arriviste conniving his way into the 18th-century English aristocracy.

The 1880 Romanian novella Ivan Turbincă tells the story of a kind, but hedonistic and scheming ex soldier who ends up tricking God, the Devil, and the Grim Reaper so that he can sneak into Heaven to party forever. 

Aleko Konstantinov wrote the 1895 novel &quot;Bay Ganyo&quot; about the eponymous Bulgarian rogue. The character conducts business of uneven honesty around Europe before returning home to get into politics and newspaper publishing. Bay Ganyo is a well-known stereotype in Bulgaria.

====Works influenced by the picaresque====
In the English-speaking world, the term &quot;picaresque&quot; has referred more to a literary technique or model than to the precise genre that the Spanish call &quot;picaresco&quot;. The English-language term can simply refer to an episodic recounting of the adventures of an anti-hero on the road.

Laurence Sterne&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman&quot; (1761–1767) and &quot;A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy&quot; (1768) each have strong picaresque elements. Voltaire&#x27;s satirical novel &quot;Candide&quot; (1759) contains elements of the picaresque. An interesting variation on the tradition of the picaresque is &quot;The Adventures of Hajji Baba of Ispahan&quot; (1824), a satirical view on early 19th-century Persia, written by James Morier. Another novel on the same theme is &quot;A Rogue&#x27;s Life&quot; (1857) by Wilkie Collins.

Elements of the picaresque novel are found in Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; (1836–37).Nikolai Gogol occasionally used the technique, as in &quot;Dead Souls&quot; (1842–52). Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot; (1884) also has some elements of the picaresque novel.

===20th and 21st centuries===
&quot;Kvachi Kvachantiradze&quot; is a novel by Mikheil Javakhishvili published in 1924. This is, in brief, the story of a swindler, a Georgian Felix Krull, or perhaps a cynical Don Quixote, named Kvachi Kvachantiradze: womanizer, cheat, perpetrator of insurance fraud, bank-robber, associate of Rasputin, filmmaker, revolutionary, and pimp.

&quot;The Twelve Chairs&quot; (1928) and its sequel, &quot;The Little Golden Calf&quot; (1931), by Ilya Ilf and Yevgeni Petrov (together known as Ilf and Petrov) became classics of 20th-century Russian satire and the basis for numerous film adaptations.

Camilo José Cela&#x27;s &quot;The Family of Pascual Duarte&quot; (1942), Ralph Ellison&#x27;s &quot;Invisible Man&quot; (1952) and &quot;The Adventures of Augie March&quot; by Saul Bellow (1953) were also among mid-twentieth-century picaresque literature. John A. Lee&#x27;s &quot;Shining with the Shiner&quot; (1944) tells amusing tales about New Zealand folk hero Ned Slattery (1840–1927) surviving by his wits and beating the &#x27;Protestant work ethic&#x27;. So too is Thomas Mann&#x27;s &quot;Confessions of Felix Krull&quot; (1954), which like many novels emphasizes the theme of a charmingly roguish ascent in the social order. &quot;Under the Net&quot; (1954) by Iris Murdoch, Günter Grass&#x27;s &quot;The Tin Drum&quot; (1959) is a German picaresque novel. John Barth&#x27;s &quot;The Sot-Weed Factor&quot; (1960) is a picaresque novel that parodies the historical novel and uses black humor by intentionally incorrectly using literary devices.

Other examples from the 1960s and 1970s include Jerzy Kosinski&#x27;s &quot;The Painted Bird&quot; (1965), Vladimir Voinovich&#x27;s &quot;The Life and Extraordinary Adventures of Private Ivan Chonkin&quot; (1969), and Arto Paasilinna&#x27;s &quot;The Year of the Hare&quot; (1975).

Examples from the 1980s include John Kennedy Toole&#x27;s novel &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot;, which was published in 1980, eleven years after the author&#x27;s suicide, and won the 1981 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. It follows the adventures of Ignatius J. Reilly, a well-educated but lazy and obese slob, as he attempts to find stable employment in New Orleans and meets many colorful characters along the way. 

Later examples include Umberto Eco&#x27;s &quot;Baudolino&quot; (2000), and Aravind Adiga&#x27;s &quot;The White Tiger&quot; (Booker Prize 2008).

William S. Burroughs was a devoted fan of picaresque novels, and gave a series of lectures involving the topic in 1979 at Naropa University in Colorado. He says it is impossible to separate the anti-hero from the picaresque novel, that most of these are funny, and they all have protagonists who are outsiders by their nature. His list of picaresque novels includes Petronius&#x27; novel &quot;Satyricon&quot; (54–68 AD), &quot;The Unfortunate Traveller&quot; (1594) by Thomas Nashe, both &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot; (1943) and &quot;A Voice Through a Cloud&quot; (1950) by Denton Welch, &quot;Two Serious Ladies&quot; (1943) by Jane Bowles, &quot;Death on Credit&quot; (1936) by Louis-Ferdinand Céline, and even himself.

In contemporary Latin American literature, there are Manuel Rojas&#x27; &quot;Hijo de ladrón&quot; (1951), Joaquín Edwards&#x27; &quot;El roto&quot; (1968), Elena Poniatowska&#x27;s &quot;Hasta no verte Jesús mío&quot; (1969), Luis Zapata&#x27;s &quot;Las aventuras, desventuras y sueños de Adonis García, el vampiro de la colonia Roma&quot; (1978) and José Baroja&#x27;s &quot;Un hijo de perra&quot; (2017), among others.

====Works influenced by the picaresque====

* Jaroslav Hašek&#x27;s &quot;The Good Soldier Švejk&quot; (1923) is an example of a work from Central Europe that has picaresque elements.
* J. B. Priestley made use of the form in his &quot;The Good Companions&quot; (1929), which won the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Fiction.
* Fritz Leiber&#x27;s sword and sorcery series of novels, &quot;Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser&quot;, are considered to have many picaresque elements, and are sometimes described as picaresque on the whole.
* Hannah Tinti&#x27;s novel &quot;The Good Thief&quot; (2008) features a young, one-handed orphan who craves a family, and finds one in a group of rogues and misfits.

===In cinema===
In 1987 an Italian comedy film written and directed by Mario Monicelli was released under the Italian title &quot;I picari&quot;. It was co-produced with Spain, where it was released as &quot;Los alegres pícaros&quot;, and internationally as &quot;The Rogues&quot;. Starring Vittorio Gassman, Nino Manfredi, Enrico Montesano, Giuliana De Sio and Giancarlo Giannini, the film is freely inspired by the Spanish novels &quot;Lazarillo de Tormes&quot; and &quot;Guzman de Alfarache&quot;. The Disney film &quot;Aladdin&quot; (1992) can be considered a picaresque story.

===In television===
The sixth episode of Season 1 of the Spanish fantasy television series, &quot;El ministerio del tiempo&quot; (English title: &quot;The Ministry of Time&quot;), entitled &quot;Tiempo de pícaros&quot; (Time of rascals) focuses on Lazarillo de Tormes as a young boy prior to his adventures in the genre-creating novel that bears his name. The Netflix series &quot;Inventing Anna&quot; (2022) has been called &quot;somewhat anhedonic post-internet picaresque&quot;.
