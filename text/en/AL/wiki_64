<text>Lewis Milestone (born Leib Milstein (Russian: Лейб Мильштейн); September 30, 1895 – September 25, 1980) was an American film director. Milestone directed &quot;Two Arabian Knights&quot; (1927) and &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1930), both of which received the Academy Award for Best Director. He also directed &quot;The Front Page&quot; (1931), &quot;The General Died at Dawn&quot; (1936), &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; (1939), &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot; (1960), and received the directing credit for &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1962), though Marlon Brando largely appropriated his responsibilities during its production.

==Early life==

Lev or Leib Milstein was born in Kishinev, capital of Bessarabia, Russian Empire (now Chișinău, Moldova), into a wealthy, distinguished family of Jewish heritage. Milstein received his primary education at Jewish schools, reflecting his parents&#x27; liberal social and political orientation, and including a study of several languages. Milstein&#x27;s family discouraged his early love of theater and his desire to follow the dramatic arts, and dispatched him to Mittweida, Saxony, to study engineering.

After neglecting his classes to attend local theater productions, Milstein failed his coursework. He was intent on pursuing a theatrical career and bought a one-way ticket to the United States. Milstein arrived in Hoboken, New Jersey, on November 14, 1913, shortly after his eighteenth birthday.

Milstein, who found difficulty supporting himself in New York City, worked as a janitor, door-to-door salesman and lace-machine operator before finding a position as portrait-and-theater photographer in 1915. In 1917, shortly after the US entered World War I, he enlisted in the Army Signal Corps. Milstein was stationed in New York City and Washington, D.C., and was assigned to the corps&#x27; photography unit, where he trained in aerial photography, assisted on training films and edited documentary combat footage. His cohorts in the Signal Corps included future Hollywood directors Josef von Sternberg and Victor Fleming. In February 1919, Milstein was discharged from the army, immediately obtained US citizenship, and legally changed his surname to Milestone. An acquaintance from the Signal Corps Jesse D. Hampton, now an independent film producer, secured Milestone an entry-level position as an assistant editor in Hollywood.

===Hollywood apprenticeship 1919–1924===

When Milestone arrived in Hollywood, he was still in financial difficulties. He later said to sustain himself until his studio job commenced, he briefly worked as a card dealer at a Los Angeles City Oil Field gambling venue.

Milestone accepted mundane assignments from Hampton at $20 per week, and progressed from assistant editor toward director. In 1920 he was chosen as general assistant to director Henry King at Pathé Exchange. Milestone&#x27;s first credited work was as assistant on King&#x27;s film &quot;Dice of Destiny&quot; (1920).

During the next six years, Milestone &quot;took on jobs in any capacity available&quot; in the Hollywood film industry, working as editor for director-producer Thomas Ince, as general assistant and co-author on film scripts by William A. Seiter and as a gag writer for comedian Harold Lloyd. In 1923, Milestone followed Seiter to Warner Brothers studios as assistant director on Little Church Around the Corner (1923), completing most of the film-making tasks on the production. Milestone&#x27;s reputation as an effective &quot;film doctor&quot; who was skilled at salvaging movies led Warner to began offering Milestone&#x27;s services to other studios at inflated rates.

==Director: Silent era, 1925–1929==

By 1925, Milestone was writing screen treatments for films at Universal and Warner studios, among them &quot;The Mad Whirl&quot;, &quot;Dangerous Innocence&quot;, &quot;The Teaser&quot; and &quot;Bobbed Hair&quot;. The same year, Milestone approached Jack L. Warner with a proposal: Milestone would provide the producer with a story free of charge if he was allowed to direct it. Warner agreed to sponsor Milestone&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Seven Sinners&quot; (1925).

&quot;Seven Sinners&quot; is one of three films Milestone directed with Marie Prevost, Mack Sennett and a former female comedian. Jack Warner appointed Darryl F. Zanuck as screenwriter. The film is a &quot;semi-sophisticated&quot; comedy incorporating elements of slapstick, and was sufficiently successful with critics and the public to allow Milestone, now 29 years old, additional directing assignments.

Milestone&#x27;s second Prevost comedy was &quot;The Caveman&quot; (1926), which quickly earned him praise for its &quot;adroit direction&quot;. During production, Milestone broke his contract with the studio over his exploitation as a &quot;film doctor&quot;: Warners sued for damages and won, forcing Milestone to file for bankruptcy. &quot;The Caveman&quot; was his last film for Warner Bros. until &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; (1943). Undeterred, Paramount Pictures quickly acquired Milestone.

&quot;The New Klondike&quot; (1926), a sports-themed drama based on a Ring Lardner story, was filmed on location in Florida. Despite a &quot;lukewarm&quot; response from critics, Paramount was enthusiastic regarding Milestone&#x27;s prospects, showcasing him with other young studio talent in the promotional film &quot;Fascinating Youth&quot; (1926). An argument with screen star Gloria Swanson on the set of &quot;Fine Manners&quot; (1926) led Milestone to walk off the project, leaving director Richard Rosson to complete it.

&quot;Two Arabian Knights&quot; (1927), which is considered Milestones most outstanding work during the silent era, was inspired by the Anderson–Stallings stage play &quot;What Price Glory?&quot; (1924), and director Raoul Walsh&#x27;s 1924 screen adaptation of it. It was the first film in a four-year contract with Howard Hughes&#x27; The Caddo Company and is Milestone&#x27;s only film of 1927. The film garnered Milestone an Academy Award for best comedy direction in 1927, prevailing over Charlie Chaplin&#x27;s &quot;The Circus&quot; (1927). During World War I, doughboys William Boyd and Louis Wolheim, and love-object Mary Astor form a comic triangle.

&quot;The Garden of Eden&quot; (1927) was made under a Caddo releasing agreement with Universal Pictures. The film is &quot;a variation on the Cinderella story... of acidic sophistication&quot;, and was adapted by screenwriter Hans Kraly; it resembles, in both script and visual production, the works of Ernst Lubitsch. The project benefited from the lavish sets William Cameron Menzies designed and the cinematography of John Arnold. The film stars Corinne Griffith. Milestone&#x27;s cinematic rendering of &quot;Two Arabian Knights&quot; and &quot;The Garden of Eden&quot; established him as a skilled practitioner of &quot;rough and sophisticated&quot; comedy.

Milestone was wary of being stereotyped as a comedy director, and he shifted to an emerging genre director Josef von Sternberg popularized with his gangland fantasy &quot;Underworld&quot; (1927). &quot;The Racket&quot;, a &quot;taut and realistic&quot; depiction of a mobster-controlled police department, distinguished Milestone as a capable director of the genre but its reception was lessened by a flood of inferior gangster films in the late 1920s. &quot;The Racket&quot; was nominated for Best Picture at the 1928 Academy Awards.

==Early sound era: 1929–1936==

=== &quot;New York Nights&quot; (1929) ===

Milestone&#x27;s first sound production &quot;New York Nights&quot; proved inauspicious. The film was a vehicle for silent screen icon Norma Talmadge—whose spouse was producer Joseph Schenck. Milestone attempted to accommodate United Artists&#x27; desire to blend the &quot;show-biz&quot; and gangster genres in an adaptation of &quot;the justly forgotten&quot; Broadway production &quot;Tin Pan Alley&quot;. According to Chanham, &quot;New York Nights&quot; &quot;gave little indication of Milestone&#x27;s ability in adapting to sound techniques&quot;. According to film historian Joseph Millichap:

=== &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1930) ===

Milestone&#x27;s anti-war picture&quot; All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; is widely recognized as his directorial masterpiece, and as one of the most-compelling dramatizations of soldiers in combat during the Great War. The film was adapted from Erich Maria Remarque&#x27;s 1929 eponymous novel. Milestone cinematically conveyed the &quot;grim realism and anti-war themes&quot; that characterize the novel. Universal Studio&#x27;s head of production Carl Laemmle Jr., purchased the film rights to capitalize on the international success of Remarque&#x27;s book. According to Strago (2017):
&quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; presents the war from the perspective of a unit of patriotic, young, German soldiers who become disillusioned with the horrors of trench warfare. Actor Lew Ayres portrays the naïve, sensitive youth Paul Baumer. According to Thompson (2015), Milestone—who was uncredited—together with screenwriters Maxwell Anderson, Del Andrews and George Abbott, wrote a script that &quot;reproduces the terse, tough dialogue&quot; of Remarque&#x27;s novel to &quot;expose war for what it is, and not glorify it&quot;. Originally conceived as a silent film, Milestone filmed both a silent and a talkie version, shooting them together in sequence.

The most significant technical innovation of &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; is Milestone&#x27;s integration of the era&#x27;s rudimentary sound technology with the advanced visual effects developed during the late silent era. Applying post-synchronization of the sound recordings, Milestone was at liberty to &quot;shoot the way we&#x27;ve always shot... it was that simple. All the tracking shots were done with a silent camera&quot;. In one of the film&#x27;s most-disturbing sequences, Milestone used tracking shots and sound effects to graphically show the effects of artillery and machine guns on advancing troops.

The movie met with critical and popular approval, and earned Milestone Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director. &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; established Milestone as a talent in the film industry; Howard Hughes rewarded him with an adaptation of Ben Hecht&#x27;s and Charles MacArthur&#x27;s 1928 play &quot;The Front Page&quot;.

===&quot;The Front Page&quot; (1931)===

&quot;The Front Page&quot; (1931), in which Milestone depicted backroom denizens of Chicago newspaper tabloids, is considered one of the most influential films of 1931 and introduced the Hollywood archetype of the experienced, fast-talking reporter. The film&#x27;s script retains the &quot;sparkling dialogue [and] hard, fast and ruthless pace&quot; of Ben Hecht&#x27;s and Charles MacArthur&#x27;s 1928 stage production. &quot;The Front Page&quot; began the 1930s journalism genre, which other studios imitated, and a number of remakes—including Howard Hawks&#x27; &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; (1940) and Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;The Front Page&quot; (1974)—appeared.

Milestone was disappointed with the casting of Pat O&#x27;Brien as reporter &quot;Hildy&quot; Johnson; he wanted to cast James Cagney or Clark Gable in the role but producer Howard Hughes vetoed this choice in favor of O&#x27;Brien, who had performed in the Chicago stage production of &quot;The Front Page&quot;.

According to Biographer Charles Higham (1973), &quot;&quot;The Front Page&quot; surpasses &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; in being wholly a masterpiece, and one of the greatest pictures of the period. Milestone achieved a perfect marriage of film and theater. The picture has a vividness not matched in a newspaper subject until Citizen Kane&quot;

According to Joseph Millichap:
Milestone&#x27;s technique is demonstrated in the opening tracking shots of the newspaper&#x27;s printing plant, and the confrontation between Molly Malloy (Mae Clarke) and a throng of reporters. &quot;The Front Page&quot; received a Best Picture nomination at the Academy Awards and a &quot;Film Daily&quot; poll of 300 movie critics listed Milestone among &quot;The Ten Best Directors&quot;.

===1932–1936===

Milestone was troubled by film directors&#x27; declining control within the studio system and supported King Vidor&#x27;s proposal to organize a filmmakers&#x27; cooperative. Supporters for a Screen Directors Guild included Frank Borzage, Howard Hawks, Ernst Lubitsch, Rouben Mamoulian and William Wellman, among others. By 1938, the guild was incorporated, representing 600 directors and assistant directors.

In the mid-1930s, Paramount Pictures was experiencing a financial crisis that inhibited their commitments to their European film stylists such as Josef von Sternberg, Ernst Lubitsch and Milestone. Under these conditions, Milestone experienced difficulty in locating compelling literary material, production support and proper casting. The first among these films is &quot;Rain&quot; (1932).

Allied Artists assigned Milestone rising star Joan Crawford, who was known for her silent film roles as a flapper, to play prostitute Sadie Thompson. Crawford expressed disappointment with her interpretation of the role. Milestone was not yet affected by the Production Code, and his portrayal of the overwrought Puritan missionary Reverend Davidson (Walter Huston); his rape of Thompson blends violence with sexual and religious symbolism using swift cutting.
The film was termed &quot;slow and stage-bound&quot; and &quot;stiff and stagey&quot;. Milestone said of &quot;Rain&quot;:

&quot;Hallelujah, I&#x27;m a Bum&quot; (1933), which was released during the Great Depression, was an attempt by United Artists to reintroduce singer Al Jolson after his three-year hiatus from film roles. The film is based on a Ben Hecht story, with a score by Rodgers and Hart featuring &quot;rhythmic dialogue&quot; delivered in song-song; its sentimental, romantic theme of a New York City tramp was received with indifference and dismay by moviegoers. Film historian Joseph Millichap observed that &quot;the problem of this entertainment fantasy was that it brushed aside just enough reality to confuse its audience. Americans in the winter of 1933 were not in the mood to be advised that the life of a hobo was the road to true happiness, especially by a star earning $25,000 a week.&quot; Milestone&#x27;s effort to make a &quot;socially conscious&quot; musical was generally ill-received at its New York opening and he had difficulty finding a more serious film project.

Milestone attempted to make a film about the Russian Revolution (working title: &quot;Red Square&quot;) based on Stalinist Ilya Ehrenburg&#x27;s work &quot;The Life and Death of Nikolai Kourbov&quot; (1923), and an adaptation of H. G. Wells&#x27;s &quot;The Shape of Things to Come&quot; (1933) proposed by Alexander Korda, but neither project materialized. In lieu of these unrealized films, Milestone directed &quot;a string of three insignificant studio pieces&quot; from 1934 to 1936.

Milestone accepted a lucrative deal to direct a film starring John Gilbert and left United Artists for Harry Cohn&#x27;s Columbia Pictures. &quot;The Captain Hates the Sea&quot; (1934) is a spoof of the 1932 movie &quot;Grand Hotel&quot;, which stars Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford and John Barrymore. Milestone&#x27;s largely improvised film stars an ensemble of Columbia&#x27;s character actors, among them Victor McLaglen and The Three Stooges. Joseph Millichap described &quot;The Captain Hates the Sea&quot; as &quot;a very uneven, disconnected, rambling piece&quot;. Cost overruns on &quot;The Captain Hates the Sea&quot;, which were complicated by heavy drinking by the cast members—soured relations between Milestone and Cohen. The movie is notable as the final film of Gilbert&#x27;s career.

Milestone&#x27;s next two films for Paramount &quot;Paris in Spring&quot; (1935) and &quot;Anything Goes&quot; (1936), are his only musicals of his career, but are relatively undistinguished in their execution. Milestone described them as &quot;insignificant&quot;. Milestone was assigned &quot;Paris in Spring&quot;, a romantic musical farce. Leading man Tullio Carminati had just completed the operetta-like &quot;One Night of Love&quot; (1934) with Grace Moore at Columbia Studios. Paramount paired Mary Ellis with Carminati, and it was Milestone&#x27;s task to direct a film to rival Columbia&#x27;s success. Aside from a credible replica of Paris created by art directors Hans Dreier and Ernst Fegté, Milestone&#x27;s directing failed to overcome &quot;the essential flatness of the tale&quot;. &quot;Anything Goes&quot;, a musical starring Bing Crosby and Ethel Merman, and adapted from Cole Porter&#x27;s 1934 Broadway musical, includes some enduring songs, including &quot;I Get a Kick Out of You&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re the Top&quot;, and the title song. According to Canham, Milestone&#x27;s directing is conscientious but he showed little enthusiasm for the genre.

===&quot;The General Died at Dawn&quot; (1936)===
Following his two lackluster musicals, Milestone returned to form in 1936 with &quot;The General Died at Dawn&quot;, which is reminiscent in theme, setting and style of director Josef von Sternberg&#x27;s &quot;The Shanghai Express&quot; (1932).

The screenplay was written by Leftist playwright Clifford Odets and is derived from an obscure pulp-influenced manuscript by Charles G. Booth. It is set in the Far East, and has a sociopolitical theme: the &quot;tension between democracy and authoritarianism&quot;. In the opening few minutes, Milestone establishes the American mercenary O&#x27;Hara (Gary Cooper), who has republican commitments. His adversary is the complex, Chinese warlord General Yang (Akim Tamiroff). Madeleine Carroll is cast as the young missionary Judy Perrie, who is &quot;trapped between divided social forces&quot; and struggles to overcome her diffidence, and ultimately joins O&quot;Hara in supporting a peasant revolt against Yang.

Milestone&#x27;s brings to the adventure-melodrama a &quot;bravura&quot; exposition of his cinematic style and technical skills; an impressive use of tracking, a five-way split screen and a widely noted use of a match dissolve that transitions from a billiard table to a white door handle leading to an adjoining room; it is &quot;one of the most expert match shots on record&quot; according to historian John Baxter.

Though disparaged by Milestone in retrospect, &quot;The General Died at Dawn&quot; is considered one of the &quot;masterpieces&quot; of 1930s Hollywood cinema. Milestone was served by cinematographer Victor Milner, art directors Hans Dreier and Ernst Fegté, and composer Werner Janssen in, according to Baxter (1970), creating &quot;his most exquisite and exciting if not most meaningful examination of social friction in a human context&quot;.

==Directorial hiatus: 1936–1939==

After completing &quot;The General Died at Dawn&quot;, Milestone experienced a series of professional setbacks, including lawsuits, failed projects and broken contracts, that stalled his film career for three years.

During this period, Milestone pursued a number of serious projects, including direction of a film version of Vincent Sheean&#x27;s memoir &quot;Personal History&quot; (1935), which Alfred Hitchcock later directed as &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot; (1940), went unfulfilled. Another failed project was a screenplay Milestone and Clifford Odets wrote for an adaptation of the Sidney Kingsley Broadway hit &quot;Dead End&quot; (1935) for Sam Goldwyn that went to William Wyler, a director of literary texts, like Milestone.

To remain employed, Milestone accepted Paramount&#x27;s offer to direct Pat O&#x27;Brien in show-business drama &quot;The Night of Nights&quot; (1939), a &quot;second-line&quot; studio production. According to Millichap (1981), the film&#x27;s best feature is its sets, which Hans Dreier designed.

After signing a contract with Hal Roach in late 1937 to direct an adaptation of Eric S. Hatch&#x27;s novel &quot;Road Show&quot; (1934), the producer dismissed Milestone for straying from the novel&#x27;s comedic elements. Litigation ensued, and the matter was resolved when Roach presented Milestone with another project: to adapt to film John Steinbeck&#x27;s novella &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; (1937).

===&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; (1939)===
Milestone had been impressed with Steinbeck&#x27;s novella &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; and its 1938 stage production, a morality play set during the Dust Bowl, and he was enthusiastic about the film project. Producer Hal Roach hoped to emulate the anticipated success of director John Ford&#x27;s adaptation of another Steinbeck work The Grapes of Wrath (1940). Both films drew upon the political and creative developments that emerged in the Great Depression rather than the approaching 1940s and the impending conflict in Europe. Milestone solicited Steinbeck&#x27;s support for the film; Steinbeck &quot;essentially approved the script&quot;, as did the Hays Office, which made only &quot;minor&quot; changes to the scenario.

According to Millichap (1981), Milestone maintains the &quot;anti-omniscient&quot; detachment Steinbeck applied to his novella with a cinematic viewpoint that matches the author&#x27;s literary realism. Milestone placed great emphasis on visual and sound motifs that develop the characters and themes. As such, he carefully conferred on image motifs with art director Nicolai Remisoff and cameraman Norbert Brodine, and persuaded composer Aaron Copland to provide the musical score. Critic Kingley Canham noted the importance Milestone placed on his sound motifs:

The film was a critical success and garnered Copland Academy Award nominations for Best Musical Score and Best Original Score.

Milestone, who preferred to cast &quot;relative unknowns&quot;—in this case influenced by budgetary restraints—cast Lon Chaney Jr. to play the childlike Lennie Small and Burgess Meredith as his keeper George Milton. Betty Field, in her first important feature, plays Mae, the faithless spouse of straw boss Curly (Bob Steele).

&quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture of 1939 but competing with the year&#x27;s other major films, including &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (Victor Fleming), &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (John Ford), &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; (Sam Wood), &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot; (Frank Capra), &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (William Wyler), and the winner, &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (Victor Fleming).

Despite critical accolades for &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;, the tragic narrative that ends in the mercy-killing of the doomed Lennie at the hands of his comrade George was less than gratifying to audiences, and it failed at the box office.

===Early 1940s===

Milestone&#x27;s reputation as a director was undiminished among Hollywood executives after &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;, and RKO signed him to direct two light comedies, both of which star Ronald Colman. Milestone was provided with his own production unit, and quickly satisfied his contractual obligations, directing Ginger Rogers in &quot;Lucky Partners&quot; (1940) and Anna Lee in the &quot;totally disarming frolic&quot; &quot;My Life with Caroline&quot; (1941). According to Milestone:

==World War II Hollywood propaganda: 1942–1945==

Milestone&#x27;s reputation as the director of &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1930), though an emphatically pacifist and anti-war film, positioned him as an asset in Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;patriotic and profitable&quot; production of anti-fascist war films. Film curator Charles Silver noted Milestone&#x27;s &quot;facility for capturing battle&#x27;s intrinsic spectacle... there is an inevitable pageantry to cinematic warfare that works against whatever pacifist intentions the filmmaker may have&quot;. Milestone said, &quot;how can you make a pacifist film without showing the violence of war?&quot; Responding to the &quot;general climate of opinion in wartime Hollywood&quot;, Milestone abandoned any reservations about his commitments to the US war effort and offered his services to the film industry&#x27;s propaganda units.

=== &quot;Our Russian Front&quot; (1942) ===
&quot;Our Russian Front&quot; is a 1942 war documentary assembled from of newsreel footage taken on the Russian front by Soviet citizen-journalists during the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941. In collaboration with Dutch filmmaker Joris Ivens, working with The Government Film Service in 1940, Milestone depicted the struggle of Russian villagers to resist the German invasion. Actor Walter Huston narrated the documentary and composer Dimitri Tiomkin provided the film score.

=== &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; (1943) ===
Seventeen years after directing &quot;The Caveman&quot; (1926) for Warner Brothers, Milestone returned to Warner in a one-film contract. &quot;Edge of Darkness&quot; is the first of three successful films he made in collaboration with screenwriter Robert Rossen. The film stars Errol Flynn and Ann Sheridan as Norwegian freedom fighters, and Helmut Dantine as a sociopathic Nazi commandant; it signals a change in Milestone&#x27;s professional and personal attitude toward his war films. Milestone said:

&quot;Edge of Darkness&quot;, a melodramatic film fantasy, is set in a remote Norwegian village whose inhabitants are brutalized by Nazi occupiers, inspiring resistance among the townspeople, who rebel and eliminate the Nazi occupiers. Milestone employs an &quot;anti-suspense&quot; device that shows the carnage suffered by the inhabitants then reveals the story in flashback. Milestone&#x27;s &quot;thematic oversimplification&quot; reflected Hollywood&#x27;s penchant for melodramatic propaganda.

=== &quot;The North Star&quot; (1943) ===
Milestone&#x27;s next project was the propaganda film &quot;The North Star&quot;, which dramatizes the damage caused by the German invasion of the Soviet Union to the inhabitants of a Ukrainian farming collective. US President Franklin D. Roosevelt dispatched Lowell Mellett, chief of the Bureau of Motion Pictures of the Office of War Information to enlist producer Sam Goldwyn to make a film celebrating America&#x27;s wartime alliance with Russia. Milestone&#x27;s production staff included playwright-screenwriter Lillian Hellman, cinematographer James Wong Howe, set designer William Cameron Menzies, composer Aaron Copland, lyricist Ira Gershwin and a competent cast.

Hellman&#x27;s script and Milestone&#x27;s cinematic compositions establish the bucolic settings and social unity that characterize the collective&#x27;s inhabitants. Milestone uses a tracking shot to follow the aged comic figure Karp (Walter Brennan) as he rides his cart through the village, a device Milestone used to introduce the film&#x27;s key characters. An extended sequence portrays the villagers celebrating the harvest with food, song and dance, resembling an ethnic operetta. Milestone used an overhead camera to record the circular symmetry of the happy revelers. Milestone displays his &quot;technical mastery&quot; as villagers discern the approach of German bombers. Portions of this sequence resemble documentary war footage, recalling Milestone&#x27;s work in &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1930) and Joris Ivens &quot;The Spanish Earth&quot; (1937).

&quot;The North Star&quot; received positive reviews from the mainstream press, and only Hearst-owned papers interpreted the film&#x27;s pro-Russian themes as pro-Communist propaganda. The Academy of Arts and Sciences nominated &quot;The North Star&quot; for Academy Awards for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography, Best Special Effects, Best Musical Score, Best Sound and Best Original Screenplay. The film was largely ignored at the box office.

In the post-war years, Sam Goldwyn&#x27;s &quot;The North Star&quot;, Warner Brothers&#x27; &quot;Mission to Moscow&quot; (1943) and M-G-M&#x27;s &quot;Song of Russia&quot; (1944) came under scrutiny by the anti-communist House Un-American Activities Committee.

In 1957, &quot;The North Star&quot; was reissued as &quot;Armored Attack&quot; in a heavily edited form; sequences that celebrate life under the Stalinist regime were removed. The setting is represented as Hungary during its 1956 uprising with a voice-over condemning communism.

=== &quot;The Purple Heart&quot; (1944) ===
&quot;The Purple Heart&quot; (1944), which is set in the Pacific War, is about captured American airmen who are prosecuted by Imperial Japan with violating the Geneva Conventions by participating in the July 18, 1942, Doolittle Raid over Japan by B-25 bombers.

The film is based on a real-life incident. Milestone&#x27;s technical skill in presenting the airmen&#x27;s ordeal was potent propaganda but it risked rationalizing the US bombing and anti-Japanese jingoism. The Purple Heart award which the captured men are ultimately bestowed is earned through wounds inflicted by torture to extract military secrets and not through combat. According to Millichap (1981), it is a cinematically superior war film; Milestone said of his commitment to supply propaganda for the American war effort: &quot;We didn&#x27;t hesitate to make this kind of film during the war&quot;.

=== &quot;Guest in the House&quot; (1944) ===
Milestone&#x27;s next project, the United Artists production &quot;Guest in the House&quot;, is a psychological thriller in the style of Alfred Hitchcock. Milestone was removed from the project when he underwent an emergency appendectomy during filming. Milestone contributed some scenes but John Brahm was credited with directing the film, which prepared Anne Baxter for her starring role in Joseph L. Mankiewicz&#x27;s 1950 feature &quot;All About Eve&quot;.

=== &quot;A Walk in the Sun&quot; (1945) ===
Milestone&#x27;s second collaboration with screenwriter Robert Rossen &quot;A Walk in the Sun&quot; (1945) is based on Harry Joe Brown&#x27;s 1944 eponymous novel. Milestone invested $30,000 of his own savings, a measure of his enthusiasm for the novel and its cinematic potential. &quot;A Walk in the Sun&quot; takes place during the 1943 Allied invasion of Italy; a platoon of American soldiers are tasked with advancing inland from Salerno to take a German-held bridge and farmhouse. Milestone&#x27;s perspective on war as depicted in &quot;A Walk in the Sun&quot; differs with that of &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, a moving indictment of war. According to biographer Joseph Millichap:

According to Millichap (1981), despite these limitations, Milestone avoided the &quot;set hero and mock heroics&quot; typical of Hollywood war movies, allowing for a measure of genuine realism reminiscent of his 1930 masterwork [&quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;]. Milestone&#x27;s trademark handling of tracking shots is evident in the action scenes.

==Red Scare and the Hollywood blacklist==

At the onset of the Cold War, Hollywood studios, in alliance with the US Congress, sought to expose communist-inspired content in American films. Milestone&#x27;s pro-Soviet Union film &quot;The North Star&quot; (1943), which was made at the behest of the US government to encourage American support for its wartime alliance with the USSR against the Axis powers, became a target. Other pro-Soviet Union wartime films, such as Michael Curtiz&#x27;s &quot;Mission to Moscow&quot; (1943), Gregory Ratoff&#x27;s &quot;Song of Russia&quot; (1944) and Jacques Tourneur&#x27;s &quot;Days of Glory&quot; (1944), were &quot;to haunt their creators in the McCarthy era&quot; when any hint of sympathy for the Soviet Union was considered subversive to American ideals.

Milestone&#x27;s alignment with liberal causes such as the Committee for the First Amendment compounded suspicions he harbored pro-communist sentiments during the Red Scare. The House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) summoned Milestone and other filmmakers for questioning. According to Joseph Millichap:

The effect of the Hollywood blacklist on Milestone&#x27;s creative output is unclear. Unlike many of his colleagues, he continued to find work but, according to film critic Michael Barson, the quantity and quality of his work may have been limited through industry &quot;greylisting&quot;. Millichap said, &quot;Milestone refused to comment on this side of his life: evidently he found it very painful&quot;.

==Post-war films: 1946–1951==
===&quot;The Strange Love of Martha Ivers&quot; (1946)===

The movies Milestone directed in the late 1940s represent &quot;the last distinctive period&quot; in his creative output. His first post-war project was the Hal B. Wallis production &quot;The Strange Love of Martha Ivers&quot; (1946), which is based on the story &quot;Love Lies Bleeding&quot; by John Patrick. The film, which was made In collaboration with screenwriter Robert Rossen, is, according to Higham and Greenberg (1968), a &quot;striking addition&quot; to the post-war Hollywood film genre &quot;film noir&quot;, combining a grim, 19th-century romanticism with the cinematic methods of German Expressionism.

Rossen&#x27;s and Milestone&#x27;s script provided the cast, which features Barbara Stanwyck, Van Heflin and Kirk Douglas in his first screen appearance with a &quot;taut, harsh&quot; narrative that critiques post-war, urban America as corrupt and irredeemable. Cinematographer Victor Milner supplied the &quot;film noir&quot; effects and musical director Miklós Rózsa integrated sound motifs with Milestone&#x27;s visual elements.

===&quot;Arch of Triumph&quot; (1948)===

Following &quot;The Strange Love of Martha Ivers&quot;, Milestone left Paramount and moved to the independent Enterprise Productions. His first film for Enterprise was &quot;Arch of Triumph&quot;, which is based on Erich Maria Remarque&#x27;s 1945 eponymous novel.

&quot;Arch of Triumph&quot; was highly anticipated by moviegoers, and by Enterprise Productions, which committed huge capital investments to the project. The novel is set in Paris in 1939; Remarque&#x27;s autobiographical work examines the personal devastation of two displaced persons: surgeon Dr. Ravic (Charles Boyer), who is fleeing Nazis persecution, and the &quot;demimonde&quot; courtesan Joan Modau (Ingrid Bergman); the pair fall in love and suffer a tragic fate.

Remarque&#x27;s depictions of the Paris underworld, which describe a revenge murder and a mercy killing, was at odds with the strictures of the Production Code Administration. Milestone excised &quot;the bars, brothels and operating rooms&quot;, and the sordid ending from the screenplay. Enterprise Productions executives, who wanted a film that would rival Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s recently re-released &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939), had procured Charles Boyer and Ingrid Bergman. The miscasting of screen stars Boyer and Bergman as Dr. Ravic and Joan Madou, respectively, impaired Milestone&#x27;s development of these characters with respect to the literary source. Milestone said:

Milestone delivered a four-hour version of &quot;Arch of Triumph&quot; Enterprise Productions had approved. Executives reversed that decision shortly before its release, cutting the movie to the more usual two hours. Entire scenes and characters were removed, undermining the clarity and continuity of Milestone&#x27;s work. Milestone&#x27;s overall disaffection for the project is evident in his indifferent application of cinematic technique, contributing to the failure of his film adaptation. According to Millichap (1981):

Millichap added: &quot;Wherever the blame is placed, &quot;Arch of Triumph&quot; is a clear failure, a bad film made from a good book&quot;.

&quot;Arch of Triumph&quot; was a failure at the box office and Enterprise Productions took a significant loss. Milestone continued working with the studio, accepting an offer to produce and direct a Dana Andrews and Lilli Palmer comedy, &quot;No Minor Vices&quot; (1948).
&quot;No Minor Vices&quot;, a &quot;semi-sophisticated&quot; film that is reminiscent of Milestone&#x27;s 1941 comedy &quot;My Life with Caroline&quot;, added little to Milestone&#x27;s oeuvre. After this film, Milestone departed Enterprise.

===&quot;The Red Pony&quot; (1949)===

Milestone&#x27;s next project, in collaboration with novelist John Steinbeck at Republic Pictures, was to direct a film version of &quot;The Red Pony&quot; (1937), a short story cycle set in California&#x27;s rural Salinas Valley in the early 20th century. Milestone and Steinbeck had considered adapting these coming-of-age stories about a boy and his pony since 1940. In 1946, they partnered with Republic Pictures, an amalgamation of &quot;Poverty Row&quot; studios known for low-budget westerns but now prepared to invest in a major production.

Steinbeck served as sole screenwriter on &quot;The Red Pony&quot;. His novella, composed of four short stories, is &quot;unified only by continuities of character, setting theme&quot;. Identifying a market for the film was a key concern for Republic, which insisted on a movie aimed at young audiences. In the interests of crafting a sequential, coherent narrative, Steinbeck mostly limited the film adaptation to the stories &quot;The Gift&quot; and &quot;The Leader of the People&quot;, omitting some of the novella&#x27;s harsher episodes. Steinbeck willingly provided a more upbeat ending to the film, an accommodation that according to Millichap (1981), &quot;completely distorts... the thematic thrust of Steinbeck&#x27;s story sequence&quot;.

Casting for &quot;The Red Pony&quot; presented for Milestone difficulties developing Steinbeck&#x27;s characters and themes, which explore a child&#x27;s &quot;initiation into the realities of adult life&quot;. The aging ranch hand Billy Buck is portrayed by the youthful and virile Robert Mitchum, whose character effectively displaces the father Fred Tiflin (Shepperd Strudwick) as male mentor to the nine-year-old Tom Tiflin (Peter Miles). The boy&#x27;s mother is played by Myrna Loy. According to Millichap, &quot;The major casting problem is the [young] protagonist. Perhaps no child star could capture the complexity of this role, as it is much easier for an adult to write about sensitive children than for a child to play one.&quot;

According to Millichap (1981), Milestone&#x27;s cinematic effort fails to do justice to the literary source but several of the visual and aural elements are impressive. The opening sequence resembles the prologue of his 1939 adaptation of Steinbeck&#x27;s novel &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;, introducing the natural world that will dominate and inform the characters&#x27; lives.

&quot;The Red Pony&quot; is Milestone&#x27;s first technicolor film; according to Canham (1974), his &quot;graceful visual touch&quot; is enhanced by cameraman Tony Gaudio&#x27;s painterly renderings of the rural landscape. According to Barson (2020), composer Aaron Copland&#x27;s highly regarded film score perhaps surpasses Milestone&#x27;s visual rendering of Steinbeck&#x27;s story.

&quot;The Red Pony&quot; provided Enterprise with a satisfactory &quot;prestige&quot; property, generating critical praise and respectable box office returns.

===Move to 20th Century Fox===
Milestone moved to 20th Century Fox where he made three films: &quot;Halls of Montezuma&quot; (1951), &quot;Kangaroo&quot; (1952) and &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1952).

&quot;Halls of Montezuma&quot;, which was released in January 1951, reflects the Cold War imperatives that informed Hollywood films during the Korean War. The story, which was written by Michael Blankfort with Milestone as uncredited co-screenwriter, concerns an attack by US Marines on a Japanese-held island during World War II, and focuses on the heroic suffering experienced by one patrol in its effort to locate a Japanese rocket-launching bunker. Milestone&#x27;s dual themes celebrate both Marine combat heroics, juxtaposed with an examination of psychological damage to the soldiers who participate in the &quot;horrors&quot; of modern warfare, including the torture of enemy combatants. Milestone denied &quot;Halls of Montezuma&quot; addressed his &quot;personal beliefs&quot; on the nature of war; he agreed to direct the movie as a financial expedient.

&quot;Halls of Montezuma&quot; recalls some elements of Milestone&#x27;s 1930 anti-war classic &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;. The film&#x27;s cast, like the earlier film, was selected from relatively unknown actors, their &quot;complex and believable&quot; characterizations revealing the contrasts between hardened veterans and green recruits. The cinematic handling of battle scenes is also reminiscent of the 1930 movie, where Marines deploy from their landing crafts and advance on open terrain under enemy fire. Milestone reverts to the formulaic war movie with a standard &quot;Give &#x27;em Hell&quot; climax, accompanied by the strains of the Marine Hymn. The film is commonly cited as representing the onset of a purported decline in his talents or his exploitation by the studios.

After completing &quot;Halls of Montezuma&quot;, 20th Century Fox, the studio sent Milestone to Australia to use funds limited to reinvestment in that country. Based on this consideration, Milestone filmed &quot;Kangaroo&quot; (1952), which film critic Bosley Crowther termed an &quot;antipodal Western&quot;. According to film critic Joseph Millichap (1981), Milestone struggled with the studio was over &quot;the utterly ridiculous script, a collection of Western &quot;clichés&quot; transposed from the American plains to the Australian outback&quot;. Milestone attempted to evade the poor literary vehicle by concentrating on &quot;the landscape, flora and fauna&quot; of the Australian outback at the expense of dialogue. The Technicolor cinematography by Charles G. Clarke achieved a documentary-like quality, incorporating Milestone&#x27;s hallmark panning and tracking methods. It has been argued that Milestone&#x27;s changes to the script hurt the film.

For the last of his three pictures at 20th Century Fox, Milestone delivered &quot;Les Misérables&quot; (1952), a 104-minute version of Victor Hugo&#x27;s eponymous romance novel (1862). Fox producers provided the project with their contracted actors including Michael Rennie, Debra Paget, Robert Newton and Sylvia Sidney, and lavish production support. According to Canham (1974), the script by Richard Murphy &quot;telescopes all the novel&#x27;s famous set-pieces into this cliché-ridden&quot; abbreviated adaptation. In a 1968 interview with film historians Charles Higham and Joel Greenberg, Milestone said of his approach during the filming of &quot;Les Miserables,&quot; &quot;Oh, for Chrissake, it was just a job; I&#x27;ll do it and get it over with&quot;. According to Millichap (1981), &quot;that he did little with [Hugo&#x27;s] literary classic... seems to indicate the waning of Milestone&#x27;s creative energies&quot;.

==Late career, 1952–1962==

Milestone&#x27;s final years as a filmmaker correspond to the decline of the Hollywood movie empire; his final eight films reflect these historic developments. By 1962, shortly before the release of his last Hollywood film &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;, &quot;Films and Filming&quot; (December 1962) wrote: &quot;In common with so many of the Old Guard directors, Lewis Milestone&#x27;s reputation has somewhat tarnished over the last decade. His films no longer have that stamp of individuality which distinguished his early work.&quot;

During the last stage of his career, Milestone&#x27;s films are, according to Joseph Millichap (1981), &quot;less a reprise of the director&#x27;s earlier achievements than several desperate efforts to keep working. Even more markedly than in his earlier career, Milestone moved frenetically between pictures which varied widely in setting, style and accomplishment.&quot;

=== Sojourn in Europe, 1953–1954 ===
In the early 1950s, Milestone traveled to England and Italy seeking work. He directed a biography of a diva, a World War II action drama and an international romance-melodrama.

&quot;Melba&quot; (1953), which was filmed at Horizon Pictures, is a biopic of Australian coloratura soprano singer Dame Nellie Melba. The film was an effort by producer Sam Spiegel to capitalize on the popularity of contemporaneous film biographies of Enrico Caruso and Gilbert and Sullivan. Metropolitan Opera star Patrice Munsel made her screen debut playing Melba. Aside from Munsel&#x27;s performance, Milestone was forced to work with a &quot;worthless script&quot; and an &quot;insipid cast&quot;, and failed to deliver a compelling rendering of Melba&#x27;s life. According to Kingsley Canham, &quot;Melba&quot; &quot;turned out to be a disastrous flop&quot; at the box office. Milestone remained in England during 1953 to film &quot;They Who Dare&quot;, a wartime adventure, for Mayflower Productions–British Lion Films, starring Dirk Bogarde. The film is a dramatization of an account of a British-and-Greek commando unit that was assigned to destroy a German airfield on Rhodes. The film is based on a script by Robert Westerby; Milestone delivered an action-packed climax in the final minutes of the film that recalls his early work in this genre but the film had a poor reception from critics and audiences. According to Canham (1974), Milestone&#x27;s consecutive box-office failures &quot;was not a good omen for an established director, especially in the Fifties&quot;.

Milestones next movie &quot;The Widow (La Vedova)&quot; (1955) was filmed in Italy for Ventruini/Express in 1954, and adapted by Milestone from a novel by Susan York. The film is a &quot;soap opera-ish love triangle&quot;, and stars Patricia Roc, Massimo Serato and Anna Maria Ferrero. According to Canham (1974), &quot;The triangle and its consequences are predictable, and Milestone&#x27;s part in the proceedings seems simply to record the inevitable tragedy on film&quot;.

===&quot;Pork Chop Hill&quot; (1959)===

According to Millichap (1981), &quot;Pork Chop Hill&quot; (1959), which was produced by Sy Bartlett for the Melville Company, represents the third work in &quot;an informal war trilogy&quot;, along with &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1930) and &quot;A Walk in the Sun&quot; (1945). The film is based on a recounting a Korean War battle by combat veteran S. L. A. Marshall and a screenplay by James R. Webb. According to Millichap (1981), Milestone was provided with a realistic literary platform from which to develop his final cinematic treatment of men at war.

The film&#x27;s plot involves a strategically pointless assault by a company of U.S. infantrymen to secure and defend a nondescript hill against a much larger Chinese battalion. According to Canham (1974), the plot involves &quot;The story of a battle for a strategic point of little military value, but of great moral value, during the last days of the Korean War&quot;.

Milestone, and actor and financial investor in the project Gregory Peck, who plays company commander Lieutenant Joe Clemons, argued over the presentation of the film&#x27;s themes. Rather than emphasize the pointlessness of the military operation, Peck favored a more politicized message, equating the taking of &quot;Pork Chop Hill&quot; as an equivalent to the battles of Bunker Hill and Gettysburg. According to McGee (2003) the studio&#x27;s final edit of the director&#x27;s cut blunted Milestone message concerning the futility of war, perhaps his most anti-war statement since &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1930). According to Millichap (1981):

Milestone distanced himself from the final cut of the film, saying, &quot;Pork Chop Hill became a film I am not proud of... [merely] one more war movie&quot;. In addition to Peck, Milestone cast primarily unknown actors as the officers and the rank-and-file characters, among them Woody Strode, Harry Guardino, Robert Blake in his first adult role, George Peppard, Norman Fell, Abel Fernandez, Gavin MacLeod, Harry Dean Stanton, and Clarence Williams III.

===&quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot; (1960)===
Milestone accepted an offer from Warner Bros. to produce and direct comedy-heist film &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot; (1960) for Dorchester Studios. The story by George Clayton Johnson concerns of group of ex-military comrades who orchestrate an elaborate burglary of Las Vegas&#x27;s biggest casinos. The movie stars the Rat Pack led by Frank Sinatra, who like the director, had been a supporter of the Committee for the First Amendment during the Red Scare. Milestone&#x27;s earlier success with comedy films and combat sagas may have influenced Warner&#x27;s decision to choose Milestone for the film.

The film&#x27;s screenplay, which Millichap (1981) called &quot;preposterous&quot;, was written by Harry Brown and Charles Lederer. Millichap (1981) said Milestone delivered a film that equivocates between a pure satire of American acquisitiveness or its celebration. The film was a box-office success but critics have widely dismissed it as unworthy of Milestone&#x27;s talents. According to film critic David Walsh:

===&quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1962)===

Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s remake of Frank Lloyd&#x27;s 1935 film &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; starring Clark Gable and Charles Laughton was consistent with Hollywood&#x27;s resort to blockbuster productions during the late Fifties. The studio risked over $20 million on the &quot;ill-starred&quot; 1962 &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; and recovered less than half of it.

In February 1961, the 65-year-old Milestone took over directorial duties from Carol Reed, who became disillusioned with the project due to inadequate scripting, inclement weather on location in Tahiti and disputes with leading man Marlon Brando. Milestone was tasked with bringing good order and discipline to the production, and with curbing Brando. Rather than inheriting a largely completed film, Milestone discovered only a few scenes had been filmed.

According to Miller (2010), the production history of the 1962 &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; is a record of personal and professional recriminations registered by Milestone and Brando rather than a coherent cinematic endeavor. To assert creative control over his character mutineer Fletcher Christian, Brando collaborated with screenwriters and off the set, independently of Milestone, leading Milestone to withdraw from some scenes and sequences, and effectively relinquish control to Brando. Millichap refers to the film as &quot;the Brando-Milestone&quot; &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;, noting &quot;the story of this Hollywood disaster is long and complex, but the central figure in every sense is Marlon Brando, not Lewis Milestone&quot;.

&quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; is the final completed film for which Milestone was credited but according to Canham (1974), it is not considered representative of Milestone&#x27;s &quot;oeuvre&quot;.

==Television and unrealized film projects: 1955–1965==

After completing &quot;The Widow (La Vedova)&quot; (1955), Milestone returned to the United States in search of film projects. With the Hollywood studio system in decline, Milestone resorted to television to keep working. Five years elapsed before he completed another feature film. In 1956–1957, Milestone partnered with actor-producer Kirk Douglas, who had debuted in Milestone&#x27;s &quot;The Strange Love of Martha Ivers&quot; (1946), to make a movie about a &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;-like tycoon but the project, which was titled &quot;King Kelly&quot;, was abandoned after a year.

In 1957, Milestone directed episodes of television drama series, including &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; (two episodes), &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot; (two episodes) and &quot;Suspicion&quot; (one episode). In 1958, Milestone directed actor Richard Boone, who debuted in Milestone&#x27;s&quot;Kangaroo&quot; (1952), in two episodes of the television western &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;. Milestone embarked upon the filming of Warner Bros.&#x27;s &quot;PT 109&quot; (1963), a biography of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s experiences as a torpedo boat commander in the Pacific War. After several weeks of filming, Jack L. Warner removed Milestone from the project and replaced him with director Leslie H. Martinson, who received the screen credit.

Milestone found television productions unappealing but returned to that medium after completing &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot; (1962), directing one episode of the series &quot;Arrest and Trial&quot; and one episode of &quot;The Richard Boone Show&quot;, both in 1963. Milestone&#x27;s final film work was for a multinational joint venture with American International Pictures&#x27; &quot;La Guea Seno- The Dirty Game&quot; (1965), for which he directed one episode before being replaced by Terence Young due to failing health.

Several of Milestone&#x27;s films—&quot;Seven Sinners&quot;, &quot;The Front Page&quot;, &quot;The Racket&quot;, and &quot;Two Arabian Knights&quot;—were preserved by the Academy Film Archive in 2016 and 2017.

==Personal life and death==

In 1935, Milestone and actor Kendall Lee, whose full name was Kendall Lee Glaezner, were married. Lee and Milestone had met on the set of his 1932 film &quot;Rain&quot;, in which Lee had played Mrs. MacPhail. They had no children and remained married until Lee&#x27;s death in 1978. According to biographer Joseph Millichap; &quot;over the years the Milestones were the most gracious of Hollywood hosts, giving parties that attracted the cream of the film community&quot;.

Milestone experienced declining health in the 1960s and suffered a stroke in 1978, shortly after the death of Kendall Lee, his wife of 43 years.

After further illnesses, Milestone died on September 25, 1980, at UCLA Medical Center, five days before his 85th birthday. Milestone&#x27;s final request before he died was for Universal Studios to restore &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1930) to its original length. The Library of Congress&#x27; Motion Picture Division released a fully-restored version of the film in 1998. Milestone is interred in the Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles.

==Critical appraisal==
Lewis Milestone&#x27;s &quot;oeuvre&quot; spans thirty-seven years (1925–1962) and consists of 38 feature films. As such, according to Millichap (1981), he was one of the major contributors to screen art and entertainment during the Hollywood Golden Age. Like most of his contemporary American filmmakers, Milestone&#x27;s work includes the silent and sound eras, which is evident in his style, which blends the visual elements of Expressionism with the Realism that evolved with naturalistic sound. According to Sarris in &quot;American Cinema&quot; (1968) quoted in Walsh (2001), Milestone was &quot;a formalist of the Left&quot; who was &quot;hailed as the American [Sergei] Eisenstein after &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1930) and &quot;The Front Page&quot; (1931)&quot;.

At the outset of talking pictures, the 29-year-old Milestone used his skill for an adaptation of Erich Maria Remarque&#x27;s anti-war novel &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot;, which is regarded as Milestone&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot; and the peak of his career; according to Baxter (1970), Milestone&#x27;s subsequent work never achieved the same artistic or critical success. Biographer Kingsley Canham wrote: &quot;The problem of making a classic film early in a career is that it sets a standard of comparison for all future work that is in some instances unfair&quot;. Milestone&#x27;s films occasionally exhibit the technical inventiveness and bravura of &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; but lack Milestone&#x27;s commitments to a literary source or screenplay that informed that film.

According to Millichap (1981), Milestone&#x27;s subsequent work in Hollywood includes outstanding and mediocre films that are characterized by their eclecticism but often lack any clear artistic purpose. The most predictable feature may have been an application of his technical talents. Film critic Andrew Sarris said: &quot;Milestone&#x27;s fluid camera style has always been dissociated from any personal viewpoint. He is almost the classic example of the uncommitted director... his professionalism is as unyielding as it is meaningless.&quot; Kingsley Canham said, &quot;time and again Milestone&#x27;s career has been written off because of his lack of commitment or to involvement in his work&quot;. Millichap links Milestone&#x27;s &quot;profuse, eclectic, and uneven body of work&quot; to the imperatives of the Hollywood film industry, saying:

Film critic and biographer Richard Koszarski considers Milestone &quot;one of the [1930s] more independent spirits... but like many of the pioneer directors... his relation to the studio system at the height of its [executive] powers was not a productive one&quot;. Koszarski offers a metaphor Milestone had applied to his own final works: &quot;the latter part of [Milestone]&#x27;s career was marked by only sporadic flashes of creativity, a veritable forest of saplings graced by only one or two solitary oaks&quot;.

<text>Macaws are a group of New World parrots that are long-tailed and often colorful, in the tribe Arini. They are popular in aviculture or as companion parrots, although there are conservation concerns about several species in the wild.

== Biology ==
Of the many different Psittacidae (true parrots) genera, six are classified as macaws: &quot;Ara&quot;, &quot;Anodorhynchus&quot;, &quot;Cyanopsitta&quot;, &quot;Primolius&quot;, &quot;Orthopsittaca&quot;, and &quot;Diopsittaca&quot;. Previously, the members of the genus &quot;Primolius&quot; were placed in &quot;Propyrrhura&quot;, but the former is correct in accordance with ICZN rules. In addition, the related macaw-like thick-billed parrot is sometimes referred to as a &quot;macaw&quot;, although it is not phylogenetically considered to be a macaw species. Macaws are native to Central America and North America (only Mexico), South America, and formerly the Caribbean. Most species are associated with forests, but others prefer woodland or savannah-like habitats.

Proportionately larger beaks, long tails, and relatively bare, light-coloured medial (facial patch) areas distinguish macaws from other parrots. Sometimes the facial patch is smaller in some species and limited to a yellow patch around the eyes and a second patch near the base of the beak in the members of the genus &quot;Anodorhynchus&quot;. A macaw&#x27;s facial feather pattern is as unique as a fingerprint.

The largest macaws are the hyacinth, Buffon&#x27;s (great green) and green-winged macaws. While still relatively large parrots, mini-macaws of the genera &quot;Cyanopsitta&quot;, &quot;Orthopsittaca&quot; and &quot;Primolius&quot; are significantly smaller than the members of &quot;Anodorhynchus&quot; and &quot;Ara&quot;. The smallest member of the family, the red-shouldered macaw, is no larger than some parakeets of the genus &quot;Aratinga&quot;.

Macaws, like other parrots, toucans and woodpeckers, are zygodactyl, having their first and fourth toes pointing backward.

== Species in taxonomic order ==

There are 19 species of macaws, including extinct and critically endangered species. In addition, there are several hypothetical extinct species that have been proposed based on very little evidence.
* &quot;Anodorhynchus&quot;
** Glaucous macaw, &quot;Anodorhynchus glaucus&quot; (critically endangered or extinct)
** Hyacinth macaw, &quot;Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus&quot;
** Indigo macaw or Lear&#x27;s macaw, &quot;Anodorhynchus leari&quot;
* &quot;Cyanopsitta&quot;
** Little blue macaw or Spix&#x27;s macaw, &quot;Cyanopsitta spixii&quot; (probably extinct in the wild)
* &quot;Ara&quot;
**Blue-and-yellow macaw or blue-and-gold macaw, &quot;Ara ararauna&quot;
** Blue-throated macaw, &quot;Ara glaucogularis&quot;
** Military macaw, &quot;Ara militaris&quot;
** Great green macaw or Buffon&#x27;s macaw, &quot;Ara ambiguus&quot;
** Scarlet macaw or Aracanga, &quot;Ara macao&quot;
** Red-and-green macaw or green-winged macaw, &quot;Ara chloropterus&quot;
** Red-fronted macaw, &quot;Ara rubrogenys&quot;
** Chestnut-fronted macaw or severe macaw, &quot;Ara severus&quot;
** †Cuban red macaw, &quot;Ara tricolor&quot; (extinct)
** †Saint Croix macaw, &quot;Ara autochthones&quot; (extinct)
* &quot;Orthopsittaca&quot;
** Red-bellied macaw, &quot;Orthopsittaca manilatus&quot;
* &quot;Primolius &quot;
** Blue-headed macaw, &quot;Primolius couloni&quot;
** Blue-winged macaw or Illiger&#x27;s macaw, &quot;Primolius maracana&quot;
** Golden-collared macaw, &quot;Primolius auricollis&quot;
* &quot;Diopsittaca&quot;
**Red-shouldered macaw or Hahn&#x27;s macaw, &quot;Diopsittaca nobilis&quot;

=== Hypothetical extinct species ===
Several hypothetical extinct species of macaws have been postulated based on little evidence, and they may have been subspecies, or familiar parrots that were imported onto an island and later wrongly presumed to have a separate identity.
* Martinique macaw, &quot;Ara martinica&quot;, Rothschild 1905
* Lesser Antillean macaw, &quot;Ara guadeloupensis&quot;, Clark, 1905
* Jamaican green-and-yellow macaw, &quot;Ara erythrocephala&quot;, Rothschild 1905
* Jamaican red macaw, &quot;Ara gossei&quot;, Rothschild 1905
* Dominican green-and-yellow macaw, &quot;Ara atwoodi&quot;, Clark, 1905

== Extinctions and conservation status ==

The majority of macaws are now endangered in the wild and a few are extinct. The Spix&#x27;s macaw is now probably extinct in the wild. The glaucous macaw is also probably extinct, with only two reliable records of sightings in the 20th century. The greatest problems threatening the macaw population are the rapid rate of deforestation and illegal trapping for the bird trade. Prehistoric Native Americans in the American Southwest farmed macaws in establishments known as &quot;feather factories&quot;.

International trade of all macaw species is regulated by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES). Some species of macaws—the scarlet macaw (&quot;Ara macao&quot;) as an example—are listed in the CITES Appendix I and may not be lawfully traded for commercial purposes. Other species, such as the red-shouldered macaw (&quot;Diopsittaca nobilis&quot;), are listed in Appendix II and may legally be traded commercially provided that certain controls are in place, including a non-detriment finding, establishment of an export quota, and issuing of export permits.

== Hybrids ==

Sometimes macaws are hybridized for the pet trade.

Aviculturists have reported an over-abundance of female blue-and-yellow macaws in captivity, which differs from the general rule with captive macaws and other parrots, where the males are more abundant. This would explain why the blue and gold is the most commonly hybridised macaw, and why the hybridising trend took hold among macaws. Common macaw hybrids include the harlequin (&quot;Ara ararauna&quot; × &quot;Ara chloroptera&quot;), miligold macaw (&quot;Ara ararauna&quot; × &quot;Ara militaris&quot;) and the Catalina (known as the rainbow in Australia, &quot;Ara ararauna&quot; × &quot;Ara macao&quot;). In addition, unusual but apparently healthy intergeneric hybrids between the hyacinth macaw and several of the larger &quot;Ara&quot; macaws have also occasionally been seen in captivity. Another, much rarer, occurrence of a second-generation hybrid (F2) is the miliquin macaw (harlequin and military macaws).

== Diet and clay licks ==
Macaws eat a variety of foods including seeds, nuts, fruits, palm fruits, leaves, flowers, and stems. Safe vegetables include asparagus, beets, bell peppers, broccoli, butternut, carrots, corn on the cob, dandelion greens, collard greens, hot peppers, spinach, sweet potatoes, tomatoes and zucchini. Wild species may forage widely, over for some of the larger species such as &quot;Ara araurana&quot; (blue and yellow macaw) and &quot;Ara ambigua&quot; (great green macaw), in search of seasonally available foods.

Some foods eaten by macaws in certain regions in the wild are said to contain toxic or caustic substances which they are able to digest. It has been suggested that parrots and macaws in the Amazon Basin eat clay from exposed river banks to neutralize these toxins. In the western Amazon hundreds of macaws and other parrots descend to exposed river banks to consume clay on an almost daily basis – except on rainy days. Donald Brightsmith, the principal investigator of The Macaw Society, located at the Tambopata Research Center (TRC) in Peru, has studied the clay eating behaviour of parrots at clay licks in Peru. He and fellow investigators found that the soils macaws choose to consume at the clay licks do not have higher levels of cation-exchange capacity (ability to absorb toxins) than that of unused areas of the clay licks and thus the parrots could not be using the clay to neutralize ingested food toxins. Rather, the macaws and other bird and animal species prefer clays with higher levels of sodium. Sodium is a vital element that is scarce in environments greater than 100 kilometres from the ocean. The distribution of clay licks across South America further supports this hypothesis – as the largest and most species-rich clay licks are found on the western side of the Amazon Basin far from oceanic influences. Salt-enriched (NaCl) oceanic aerosols are the main source of environmental sodium near coasts and this decreases drastically farther inland.

Clay-eating behaviour by macaws is not seen outside the western Amazon region, even though macaws in these areas consume some toxic foods such as the seeds of &quot;Hura crepitans&quot;, or sandbox tree, which have toxic sap. Species of parrot that consume more seeds, which potentially have more toxins, do not use clay licks more than species that eat a greater proportion of flowers or fruit in their diets.

Studies at TRC have shown a correlation between clay-lick use and the breeding season. Contents of nestling crop samples show a high percentage of clay fed to them by their parents. Calcium for egg development – another hypothesis – does not appear to be a reason for geophagy during this period as peak usage is after the hatching of eggs.

Another theory is that the birds, as well as other herbivorous animals, use the clay licks as a source of cobalamin, otherwise known as vitamin B12.

== Relationship with humans ==
Macaws and their feathers have attracted the attention of people throughout history, most notably in pre-Columbian civilizations such as the Inca, Wari&#x27;, and Nazca. Macaw feathers were highly desired for their bright colors and acquired through hunting and trade. Feathers were often used as adornment and were found at both ceremonial and burial sites. South American weavers have used their feathers to create a number of textiles, most notably feathered panels and tabards. Due to the fragile nature of the feathers, many of these pieces have begun to deteriorate over time.

<doc id="62264" wikidata="Q783010" url="?curid=62264" title="Australian cuisine">
<text>Australian cuisine is the food and cooking practices of Australia and its inhabitants. Australia has absorbed culinary contributions and adaptations from various cultures around the world, including British, European, Asian and Middle Eastern.

Indigenous Australians have occupied Australia for some 65,000 years, during which they developed a unique hunter-gatherer diet, known as bush tucker, drawn from regional Australian plants and animals. Australia became a collection of British colonies from 1788 to 1900, during which time culinary tastes were strongly influenced by British and Irish migrants, with agricultural products such as beef cattle, sheep and wheat becoming staples in the local diet. The Australian gold rushes introduced more varied immigrants and cuisines, mainly Chinese, whilst post-war immigration programs led to a large-scale diversification of local food, mainly due to the influence of migrants from the Mediterranean, East Asia and South Asia.

Australian cuisine in the 21st century reflects the influence of globalisation, with many fast-food restaurants and international trends becoming influential. Organic and biodynamic foods have also become widely available alongside a revival of interest in bush tucker. Australia exports many agricultural products, including cattle, sheep, poultry, milk, vegetables, fruit, nuts, wheat, barley and canola. Australia also produces wine, beer and soft drinks.

While fast food chains are abundant, Australia&#x27;s metropolitan areas have restaurants that offer both local and international foods. Restaurants which include contemporary adaptations, interpretations or fusions of exotic influences are frequently termed Modern Australian.

==History==
===Indigenous Australian bush food===
Indigenous Australians have lived off native flora and fauna of the Australian bush for over 60,000 years. In modern times, this collection of foods and customs has become known as bush tucker.

It is understood that up to 5,000 species of Australian flora and fauna were eaten by Indigenous Australians. Hunting of kangaroo, wallaby and emu was common, with other foods widely consumed including bogong moths, witchetty grubs, lizards and snakes. Bush berries, fruits, and nuts were also used, including the now widely cultivated macadamia nut, and wild honeys were also exploited. Fish were caught using tools such as spears, hooks and traps; in some areas, the construction of complex weir systems allowed the development of forms of aquaculture.

Resource availability and dietary make-up varied from region to region and scientific theories of bush tucker plants being spread by hand have recently emerged. Food preparation techniques also varied; however, a common cooking technique was for the carcass to be thrown directly on a campfire to be roasted.

Native food sources were used to supplement the colonists&#x27; diet following the arrival of the First Fleet in Botany Bay in 1788.

===Development of Australian cuisine===

Following the pre-colonial period, European colonisers began arriving with the First Fleet at Sydney harbour in 1788. The diet consisted of &quot;bread, salted meat and tea with lashings of rum (initially from the West Indies but later made from the waste cane of the sugar industry in Queensland).&quot; The British found familiar game in Australia including swan, goose, pigeon and fish, but the new settlers often had difficulty adjusting to the prospect of native fauna as a staple diet. Meat constituted a large proportion of the Australian diet during the colonial era and into the 20th century.

After initial difficulties, Australian agriculture became a major global producer and supplied fresh produce for the local market. Stock grazing (mostly sheep and cattle) is prevalent throughout the continent. Queensland and New South Wales became Australia&#x27;s main beef cattle producers, while dairy cattle farming is found in the southern states, predominantly in Victoria. Wheat and other grain crops are spread fairly evenly throughout the mainland states. Sugar cane is also a major crop in Queensland and New South Wales. Fruit and vegetables are grown throughout Australia and wheat is a main component of the Australian diet. Today there are over 85,681 farm businesses in Australia, 99 percent of which are locally owned and operated.

Barbecued meat is almost synonymous with Australian cuisine, though it is estimated that more than 10% of Australians are now vegetarian.

===Modern Australian cuisine===
After World War II, subsequent waves of multicultural immigration, with a majority drawn from Asia and the Mediterranean region, and the strong, sophisticated food cultures these ethnic communities have brought with them influenced the development of Australian cuisine. This blending of &quot;European techniques and Asian flavours&quot; came to be known as Modern Australian cuisine.

Arguably the first Modern Australian restaurant was Sydney&#x27;s Bayswater Brasserie (est. 1982), which offered Mediterranean dishes with Asian and Middle Eastern influences and &quot;showed Sydney [...] that food can be adventurous without being expensive&quot;. The term itself was first used in print in the 1993 edition of the Sydney Morning Herald &quot;Good Food Guide&quot;, which placed 34 restaurants under this heading, and was quickly adopted to describe the burgeoning food scene in Sydney in the 1990s. Leading exponents of the style include Tetsuya Wakuda, Neil Perry and Peter Gilmore.

As of 2014, the term is considered somewhat dated, with many restaurants preferring to call their style &quot;contemporary Australian cuisine&quot; instead.

==Fruit and vegetables==
===Fruit===
There are many species of Australian native fruits, such as quandong (native peach), wattleseed, muntries/munthari berry, Illawarra plums, riberry, native raspberries, and lilli pillies, as well as a range of native citrus species including the desert lime and finger lime. These usually fall under the category of bush tucker, which is used in some restaurants and in commercial preserves and pickles but not generally well known among Australians due to its low availability.

Australia also has large fruit-growing regions in most states for tropical fruits in the north, and stone fruits and temperate fruits in the south which has a mediterranean or temperate climate. The Granny Smith variety of apples originated in Sydney in 1868. Another well-known Western Australian apple variety is the Cripps Pink, known locally and internationally as &quot;Pink Lady&quot; apples, which was first cultivated in 1973.

Fruits cultivated and consumed in Australia include apples, banana, kiwifruit, oranges and other citrus, mangoes (seasonally), mandarin, stonefruit, avocado, watermelons, rockmelons, lychees, pears, nectarines, plums, apricots, grapes, melons, papaya (also called pawpaw), pineapple, passionfruit and berries (strawberries, raspberries, etc.).

===Vegetables===
In the temperate regions of Australia vegetables are traditionally eaten seasonally, especially in regional areas, although in urban areas there is large-scale importation of fresh produce sourced from around the world by supermarkets and wholesalers for grocery stores, to meet demands for year-round availability. Spring vegetables include artichoke, asparagus, bean shoots, beetroot, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, cucumber, leek, lettuce, mushrooms, peas, rhubarb, and spinach; summer vegetables include capsicum, cucumber, eggplant, squash, tomato, and zucchini.

==Meat and poultry==

Chicken is the most commonly consumed of all meats or poultry by weight, with approximately 47 kilograms of chicken consumed by the average Australian per year.

 Australians ate around 25 kilograms of beef per person with beef having a 35% share of fresh meat sales by value, the highest of any fresh meat in 2018–19.

Lamb is very popular in Australia, with roasting cuts (legs and shoulders), chops, and shanks being the most common cuts. Lamb will often form part of either a Sunday roast or a barbecue. It is also commonly found as an ingredient in gyros and doner kebabs, brought by Greek and Turkish immigrants in the 1960s and 1970s. Australia consumes more lamb and mutton than any other country listed by the OECD-FAO (with Kazakhstan in second place). In 2017, Australians consumed an average of per person. By way of comparison, New Zealanders average and Americans just .

Lunch at an Australian pub is called a &quot;counter lunch&quot;, while the term &quot;counter meal&quot; is used for either lunch or dinner. Common dishes served at counter lunches and counter meals are steak and chips, chicken parmigiana and chips, a mixed grill (an assortment of grilled meats), and roast lamb or beef with roast vegetables.

=== Game===
Kangaroo meat is available as game in Australia, although it is not among the most commonly eaten meats. In colonial-era recipes, kangaroo was treated much like ox tail, and braised until tender forming a rich gravy. It is available today in various cuts and sausages. Kangaroo is, however, a common commercial dog food in Australia.

Other less commonly eaten forms of game are emu and crocodile.

==Fish and seafood==
Seafood consumption is increasing, but it is less common in the Australian diet than poultry and beef. 
Australian cuisine features Australian seafood such as southern bluefin tuna, King George whiting, Moreton Bay bugs, mud crab, jewfish, dhufish (Western Australia) and yabby. Australia is one of the largest producers of abalone and rock lobster.

Fish and chips is a take-away food that originated in the United Kingdom and remains popular in Australia. It generally consists of battered deep-fried fish with deep-fried chipped (slab-cut) potatoes. Rather than cod which is more common in the UK, the most popular fish at Australian fish and chips shops, at least in southern Australian states, is flake, a fillet of gummy shark (&quot;Mustelus antarcticus&quot;).

Flathead is also a popular sport and table fish found in all parts of Australia. Barramundi is a fish found in northern Australian river systems. Bay lobsters, better known in Australia as Moreton Bay bugs, are common in seafood restaurants, or may be served with steak as &quot;surf and turf&quot;.

The most common species of the aquaculture industry are salmon, tuna, oysters, and prawns. Other food species include abalone, freshwater finfish (such as barramundi, Murray cod, silver perch), brackish water or marine finfish (such as barramundi, snapper, yellowtail kingfish, mulloway, groupers), mussels, mud crabs and sea cucumbers.

While inland river and lake systems are relatively sparse, they nevertheless provide freshwater game fish and crustacea suitable for dining. Fishing and aquaculture constitute Australia&#x27;s fifth most valuable agricultural industry after wool, beef, wheat and dairy. Approximately 600 varieties of marine and freshwater seafood species are caught and sold in Australia for both local and overseas consumption. European carp, common in the Murray River as an invasive species, is not considered edible by most Australians despite being common in cuisines across Europe.

==Dairy==

Ever since the first British settlement of 1788, Australia has had a dairy industry. Today, the Australian dairy industry produces a wide variety of milk, cream, butter, cheese and yoghurt products.

Australians are high consumers of dairy products, consuming on average some of milk per person a year, of cheese, of butter (a small reduction from previous year, largely for dietary purposes) and of yoghurt products.

==Beverages==

===Tea===
For most of Australia&#x27;s history following the arrival of British settlers, black tea was the most commonly consumed hot beverage; however, in the 1980s, coffee overtook tea in popularity. Since the 19th century, billy tea was a staple drink for those out in the Australian bush, such as those working on the land or travelling overland. Boiling water for tea in a billy over a camp fire and adding a gum leaf for flavouring remains an iconic traditional Australian method for preparing tea. Famously, it was prepared by the ill-fated swagman in the Australian folksong &quot;Waltzing Matilda&quot;.

Tea and biscuits or freshly home-baked scones are common for afternoon tea between friends and family.

===Coffee===

Today&#x27;s Australia has a distinct coffee culture. The coffee industry has grown from independent cafes since the early 20th century. The flat white became popular in Australia some time after 1985, and its invention is claimed by a Sydneysider (although this claim is disputed by a New Zealand-based barista). The iconic Greek cafés of Sydney and Melbourne were the first to introduce locally roasted coffees in 1910. US military personnel stationed in Australia during the Second World War helped to spread the habit of coffee drinking, initially in the form of instant coffee.

In 1952, the first espresso machines began to appear in Australia and a plethora of fine Italian coffee houses were emerging in Melbourne and Sydney. Pellegrini&#x27;s Espresso Bar and Legend Café often lay claim to being Melbourne&#x27;s first &#x27;real&#x27; espresso bars, opening their doors in 1954 and 1956 respectively. This decade also saw the establishment of one of Australia&#x27;s most iconic coffee brands, Vittoria, which remains the country&#x27;s largest coffee maker and distributor. The brand has existed in Australia since 1958, well before it moved to the US.

To this day, international coffee chains such as Starbucks have very little market share in Australia, with Australia&#x27;s long established independent cafés existing along with homegrown franchises such as The Coffee Club, Michel&#x27;s Patisserie, Dôme in WA, and Zarraffas Coffee in Queensland. One reason for this is that unlike with the United States and Asia, Australia for many decades had already had an established culture of independent cafés before coffee chains tried to enter the market.

===Other hot beverages===
The chocolate and malt powder Milo, which was developed by Thomas Mayne in Sydney in 1934 in response to the Great Depression, is mixed with cold or hot milk to produce a popular beverage. In recent years, Milo has been exported and is also commonly consumed in Southeast Asia even becoming a major ingredient in some desserts produced in the region.

===Alcohol===
Beer in Australia has been popular since colonial times. James Squire is considered to have founded Australia&#x27;s first commercial brewery in 1798 and the Cascade Brewery in Hobart, Tasmania, has been operating since the early 19th century. Since the 1970s, Australian beers have become increasingly popular globally – with Foster&#x27;s Lager being an iconic export brand. However, Fosters is not a large seller on the local market, with alternatives such as Victoria Bitter and Carlton Draught outselling the popular export. Craft beer is popular, as well as distinctive products from smaller breweries such as Coopers and Little Creatures.

The Australian wine industry is the fifth largest exporter of wine around the world, with 760 million litres a year to a large international export market and contributes $5.5 billion per annum to the nation&#x27;s economy. Australians consume over 530 million litres annually with a per capita consumption of about 30 litres – 50% white table wine, 35% red table wine. Wine is produced in every state, with more than 60 designated wine regions totalling approximately 160,000 hectares. Australia&#x27;s wine regions are mainly in the southern, cooler parts of the country, in New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria and Western Australia. Amongst the most famous wine districts are the Barossa Valley, Hunter Valley, Margaret River and Yarra Valley, and among the best known wine producers are Lindeman&#x27;s, Penfolds, Rosemount Estate, Wynns Coonawarra Estate. In Australia&#x27;s tropical regions, wine is produced from exotic fruits such as mango, passion fruit and lychees.

In modern times, South Australia has also become known for its growing number of premium spirits producers, with the South Australian Spirits industry quickly emerging as a world leader with producers being recognised globally such as Seppeltsfield Road Distillers, Never Never Distilling, Adelaide Hills Distilling and many more.

Rum served as a currency during the late 18th and early 19th centuries in Australia when metallic currency was in short supply.

== Take-away and convenience foods ==

The traditional places to buy take-away food in Australia has long been at a local milk bar, fish and chip shop, or bakery, though these have met with stiff competition from fast food chains and convenience stores in recent decades.

Iconic Australian take-away food (i.e. fast food) includes meat pies, sausage rolls, pasties, Chiko Rolls, and dim sims. Meat pies, sausage rolls, and pasties are often found at milk bars, bakeries, and petrol stations, often kept hot in a pie warmer or needing to be microwaved; meat pies are also a staple at AFL football matches. Chiko Rolls, dim sims and other foods needing to be deep-fried are to be found at fish and chip shops, which have the necessary deep fryers in which to cook them.

Bread rolls, with a variety of fillings, are a common alternative to sandwiches, with double-cut rolls (effectively two sandwiches) a South Australian specialty.

The Australian hamburgers and steak sandwiches are also found at fish and chip shops. Australian hamburgers consist of a fried beef patty, served with shredded lettuce and sliced tomato in a (usually toasted) round bread roll or bun. Tomato sauce or barbecue sauce are almost always included. Bacon, cheese and fried onions are also common additions, as is a slice of beetroot and/or a fried egg, with other options including sliced pineapple. Pickles are rarely included, except in burgers from American chains. Steak sandwiches come with the same options, but instead of a beef patty they consist of a thin steak and are served in two slices of toast, not buns.

Pizza has also become a popular take-away food item in Australia.

Commonly found at community and fundraising events are sausage sizzle stalls – a stall with a barbecue hot plate on which sausages are cooked. At a sausage sizzle the sausage is served in a slice of white bread, with or without tomato sauce and with the option of adding fried onions, and eaten as a snack or as a light lunch. A sausage sizzle at a polling station on any Australian state or Federal election day has humorously become known as a Democracy sausage. Similar stalls are held in the car parks of most Bunnings hardware stores on weekends, by volunteers fund-raising for service clubs, charities, societies or sporting groups. The company supplies the infrastructure and enforces standards, including prices.

The halal snack pack (&quot;HSP&quot;, also known in South Australia as an AB) originated in Australia as a fusion of Middle Eastern and European flavours, common at kebab shops around Australia. It consists of doner kebab meat served over hot chips and covered in sauces (such as chilli, garlic, or barbecue sauce).

== Baked goods and desserts ==
Damper is a traditional Australian bread prepared by swagmen, drovers and other travellers. It is a wheat-flour-based bread, traditionally baked in the coals of a campfire. Toast is commonly eaten at breakfast. An iconic commercial spread is Vegemite, a salty, B vitamin-rich savoury spread made from brewers yeast eaten on buttered toast, commonly at breakfast, or in sandwiches. A common children&#x27;s treat dating back to the 1920s is fairy bread, appearing around the same time as the Boston bun.

A classic Australian biscuit is the ANZAC biscuit, which are often homemade and so-called as they were sent by families and friends to Australian soldiers fighting in Europe and the Dardanelles in the First World War. A popular commercial brand of biscuit are Arnott&#x27;s Tim Tams.

A classic Australian cake is the lamington, made from two squares of butter cake or sponge cake coated in an outer layer of chocolate sauce and rolled in desiccated coconut. Another popular cake and dessert dish is the pavlova, a meringue-based dessert; however, the origins of this are contested as New Zealand also lays claim to its invention.

The mango pancake, a stable of Yum Cha restaurants in Sydney and elsewhere in Australia, is believed to have originated in Sydney in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

===Regional foods===
As well as national icons there are many regional iconic foods.

South Australia has FruChocs, King George whiting, and a range of foods of German origin including mettwurst, Bienenstich (beesting), streuselkuchen (German cake) and fritz. The state has its own iconic brands such as Farmers Union Iced Coffee, YoYo biscuits and Balfours frog cakes. Jubilee cake is a specialty of South Australia. In Adelaide, a variant on the meat pie is the pie floater, which is a meat pie served in a bowl of pea soup.

Victoria is famous for its home-grown Melbourne invention, the dim sim. Melbourne is also the home of the hot jam donut. Tasmania has leatherwood honey, abalone, and savoury toast. Queensland has Weis Fruit Bar and claims the lamington.

==Cities==
===Brisbane===
The cuisine of Brisbane derives from mainstream Australian cuisine, as well as many cuisines of international origin. Major native foods of the Brisbane region and commonly used in local cuisine include the macadamia, lemon-scented myrtle, Australian finger lime, bunya nut, and Moreton Bay bug. The city&#x27;s cuisine culture is often described as casual with an emphasis on outdoor dining. Roof-top dining has become an iconic part of the culinary landscape, as well as a large street food scene with food trucks and pop-up bars common. Brisbane also lays claim to several foods including &quot;smashed avo&quot;; although popularised in Sydney in the 1990s, smashed avocado was a common dish in Brisbane and Queensland dating back to the 1920s. Brisbane also claims the lamington and the Conut.

<text>William Wyler (; born Willi Wyler (); July 1, 1902 – July 27, 1981) was a German-born American film director and producer. Known for his work in numerous genres over five decades, he received numerous awards and accolades, including three Academy Awards. He holds the record of twelve nominations for the Academy Award for Best Director. For his oeuvre of work, Wyler was awarded the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award, the Directors Guild of America Lifetime Achievement Award, and the American Film Institute Life Achievement Award.

Wyler immigrated to the United States in 1921 where he worked first for Universal Studios in New York before moving to Los Angeles. By 1925, he was the youngest director at Universal, and in 1929 he directed &quot;Hell&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, Universal&#x27;s first sound production filmed entirely on location. Wyler went on to win the Academy Award for Best Director three times, for &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; (1942), &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; (1946), and &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959), all of which also won for Best Picture. He was Oscar-nominated for &quot;Dodsworth&quot; (1936), &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1939), &quot;The Letter&quot; (1940), &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; (1941), &quot;The Heiress&quot; (1949), &quot;Detective Story&quot; (1952), &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; (1953), &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; (1956), and &quot;The Collector&quot; (1965).

Film historian Ian Freer calls Wyler a &quot;bona fide perfectionist&quot;, whose penchant for retakes and an attempt to hone every last nuance &quot;became the stuff of legend.&quot; His ability to direct a string of classic literary adaptations into huge box-office and critical successes made him one of &quot;Hollywood&#x27;s most bankable moviemakers&quot; from the 1930s to the 1960s. Through his talent for staging, editing, and camera movement, he turned dynamic theatrical spaces into cinematic ones. Wyler is also known for his work as an actors&#x27; director, often propelling them to stardom.

==Early life==

Wyler was born to a Jewish family in Mulhouse, Alsace-Lorraine (then part of the German Empire) (now France). His Swiss-born father, Leopold, started as a traveling salesman but later became a thriving haberdasher in Mulhouse. His mother, Melanie (née Auerbach; died February 13, 1955, Los Angeles, aged 77), was German-born, and a cousin of Carl Laemmle, founder of Universal Pictures. During Wyler&#x27;s childhood, he attended a number of schools and developed a reputation as &quot;something of a hellraiser&quot;, being expelled more than once for misbehavior. His mother often took him and his older brother Robert to concerts, opera, and the theatre, as well as the early cinema. Sometimes at home his family and their friends would stage amateur theatricals for personal enjoyment.

Wyler was supposed to inherit the family haberdashery business in Mulhouse, France. After World War I, he spent a dismal year working in Paris at &quot;100.000 Chemises&quot; selling shirts and ties. He was so poor that he often spent his time wandering around the Pigalle district. After realizing that Willy was not interested in the haberdashery business, his mother, Melanie, contacted her distant cousin, Carl Laemmle, who owned Universal Studios, about opportunities for him.

Laemmle was in the habit of coming to Europe each year, searching for promising young men who would work in America. In 1921, Wyler, while traveling as a Swiss citizen (his father&#x27;s status automatically conferred Swiss citizenship on his sons), met Laemmle who hired him to work at Universal Studios in New York. As Wyler said: &quot;America seemed as far away as the moon.&quot; Booked onto a ship to New York with Laemmle for his return voyage, Wyler met a young Czech man, Paul Kohner (later the famous independent agent), aboard the same ship. Their enjoyment of the first class trip was short-lived, however, as they found they had to repay the cost of the passage out of their $25 weekly income as messengers to Universal Pictures. After working in New York for several years, and even serving in the New York Army National Guard for a year, Wyler moved to Hollywood to become a director.

==Career==

===1923–1929: Early work and silent films ===

Around 1923, Wyler arrived in Los Angeles and began work on the Universal Studios lot in the swing gang, cleaning the stages and moving the sets. His break came when he was hired as a second assistant editor. But his work ethic was uneven, and he would often sneak off and play billiards in a pool hall across the street from the studio, or organize card games during working hours. After some ups and downs (including getting fired), Wyler put all his efforts into becoming a director. He started as a third assistant director and by 1925 he became the youngest director on the Universal lot directing the westerns that Universal was famed for turning out. Wyler was so engrossed in his work that he would dream about &quot;different ways (for an actor) to get on a horse&quot;. In several of the one-reelers, he would join the posse in the inevitable chase of the &#x27;bad man&#x27;.

He directed his first non-Western, the lost &quot;Anybody Here Seen Kelly?&quot;, in 1928. This was followed by his first part-talkie films, &quot;The Shakedown&quot; and &quot;The Love Trap&quot;. He proved himself an able craftsman. In 1928 he became a naturalized United States citizen. His first all-talking film, and Universal&#x27;s first sound production to be filmed entirely on location, was &quot;Hell&#x27;s Heroes&quot;, filmed in the Mojave Desert in 1929.

===1930–1949: Career acclaim and stardom ===

In the early 1930s Wyler directed a wide variety of films at Universal, ranging from high-profile dramas such as &quot;The Storm&quot; with Bebe Daniels, &quot;A House Divided&quot; with Walter Huston, and &quot;Counsellor at Law&quot; with John Barrymore, to comedies like &quot;Her First Mate&quot; with Zasu Pitts and &quot;The Good Fairy&quot; with Margaret Sullavan. He became well known for his insistence on multiple retakes, resulting in often award-winning and critically acclaimed performances from his actors. After leaving Universal he began a long collaboration with Samuel Goldwyn for whom he directed such classics as &quot;Dodsworth&quot; (1936) where he earned his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director. The film starred Walter Huston, Ruth Chatterton and Mary Astor, &quot;sparking a 20-year run of almost unbroken greatness.&quot; He also directed &quot;These Three&quot; (1936) with Miriam Hopkins and Merle Oberon, &quot;Dead End&quot; (1937) with Humphrey Bogart, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1939) with Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon, &quot;The Westerner&quot; (1940) with Gary Cooper and Walter Brennan, &quot;The Little Foxes&quot; (1941) with Bette Davis, and &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; (1946) with Myrna Loy and Fredric March.

Wyler&#x27;s visual style pioneered long, uncut takes in what has come to be called deep-focus cinematography - the use of lenses which can take in the entire depth of a room, keeping everything in focus, i.e. depth of field, and thus can contain dramatic changes in lighting and characters&#x27; movements in the same shot. In this, he collaborated with the pathbreaking young cinematographer of 1940&#x27;s &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, Gregg Toland. Gregg Toland shot three of the director&#x27;s most celebrated films: &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1939), where Toland&#x27;s use of low angles, dark shadows and diffusion won him the Oscar for best cinematography; next in Lillian Hellman&#x27;s adaptation of her searing stage play, &quot;The Little Foxes&quot;, into Wyler&#x27;s 1941 film, which had Wyler and Toland working closely together to bring the hard-edged deep focus from Citizen Kane to bear on another tale of soul-destroying family wealth - including inventing a totally white make-up scheme for its star, Bette Davis, conveying her soullessness. Third, and most famously, is Toland&#x27;s work in one of the cinematographer&#x27;s last films, Wyler&#x27;s heart-wrenching masterpiece, &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; (1946). This story of three American servicemen struggling to adjust to civilian life after fighting in World War 2 hit a chord with postwar audiences. Memorable examples of deep focus here include the complex scene in which the three men wind up at the same bar, unable to stay at home, and, in its powerful closing shot, a crowded family wedding disperses, leaving only two young lovers staring at one another across the expanse of an empty living room, as stunned in place, seemingly, as the camera. All three films were decorated with multiple Oscars (see the following section).

Bette Davis received three Oscar nominations for her screen work under Wyler, and won her second Oscar for her performance in Wyler&#x27;s 1938 film &quot;Jezebel&quot;. She told Merv Griffin in 1972 that Wyler trained her with that film to be a &quot;far, far better actress&quot; than she had been. She recalled a scene that was only a bare paragraph in the script, but &quot;without a word of dialog, Willy created a scene of power and tension. This was moviemaking on the highest plane,&quot; she said. &quot;A scene of such suspense that I never have not marveled at the direction of it.&quot; During her acceptance speech when she received the AFI Life Achievement Award in 1977, she thanked him.

Laurence Olivier, whom Wyler directed in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1939) for his first Oscar nomination, credited Wyler with teaching him how to act for the screen, despite clashing with Wyler on multiple occasions. Olivier would go on to hold the record for the most nominations in the Best Actor category at nine, tied with Spencer Tracy. Critic Frank S. Nugent wrote in the &quot;New York Times&quot;, &quot;William Wyler has directed it magnificently. It is, unquestionably, one of the most distinguished pictures of the year.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; described Olivier&#x27;s performance as &quot;fantastic... he not only brings conviction to his portrayal but translates intelligently its mystical quality.&quot;

Five years later, in 1944, while visiting London, Wyler met with Olivier and his actress wife, Vivien Leigh. She invited him to see her performance in &quot;The Doctor&#x27;s Dilemma&quot;, and Olivier asked him to direct him in his planned film, &quot;Henry V&quot;. But Wyler said he was &quot;not a Shakespearian&quot; and turned down the offer.

In 1950, Wyler and Olivier made a second film together, &quot;Carrie&quot;, which was not a commercial success. However, some critics state that it nonetheless contains Olivier&#x27;s finest film performance, but because of its old-fashioned story, the film was very under-appreciated: In critic Michael Billington&#x27;s opinion:

Director and screenwriter John Huston had been a close friend of Wyler during his career. When he was twenty-eight and penniless, sleeping in parks in London, Huston returned to Hollywood to see if he could find work. Wyler, four years his senior, had met Huston when he was directing his father, Walter Huston, in &quot;A House Divided&quot; in 1931, and they got along well. Wyler read dialogue suggestions that Huston had given to his father Walter and hired John to work on the dialogue for the script. He later inspired Huston to become a director and became his &quot;early mentor.&quot; When America entered World War II in 1941, Wyler, Huston, Anatole Litvak and Frank Capra, by then all directors, enlisted at the same time. Later in his career, Huston recalled his friendship with Wyler during an interview:

====Wyler and the Second World War====

In 1941, Wyler directed &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot;, based on the 1940 novel; it was the story of a middle-class English family adjusting to the war in Europe and the bombing blitz in London. It starred Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon. Pidgeon originally had doubts about taking on the role, until fellow actor Paul Lukas told him, &quot;You will find working with Wyler to be the most delightful experience you ever had, and that&#x27;s the way it turned out.&quot; Pidgeon recalled: &quot;One thing that would have been a terrific regret in my life is if I had succeeded in getting out of doing &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot;&quot; He received his first Oscar nomination for his role, while his co-star, Greer Garson, won her first and only Academy Award for her performance.

The film idea was controversial because it was intended to cause the United States to be less isolationist. It was thought that by seeing the suffering of British citizens depicted in fiction story, Americans might be made more willing to aid Britain during their war effort. The film succeeded in its propagandistic aims, eliciting sympathy for the British people by showing Britain during its darkest days of the war. Years later, having been in the war himself, Wyler said that the film &quot;only scratched the surface of war... It was incomplete.&quot;

U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom Joseph Kennedy told the studios to stop making pro-British and anti-German films, because he believed that British defeat was imminent. But MGM producer Eddie Mannix disagreed, saying that &quot;someone should salute England. And even if we lose $100,000, that&#x27;ll be okay.&quot; &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; went on to win six Academy Awards, becoming the top box office hit of 1942. It was Wyler&#x27;s first Academy Award for Best Director.

President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill both loved the film, said historian Emily Yellin, and Roosevelt wanted prints rushed to theaters nationwide. The Voice of America radio network broadcast the minister&#x27;s speech from the film, magazines reprinted it, and it was copied onto leaflets and dropped over German-occupied countries. Churchill sent MGM chief Louis B. Mayer a telegram claiming that &quot;&quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; is propaganda worth 100 battleships.&quot; Bosley Crowther wrote in his &quot;New York Times&quot; review that &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; was the finest film yet made about the war, &quot;and a most exalting tribute to the British.&quot;

Between 1942 and 1945, Wyler volunteered to serve as a major in the United States Army Air Forces and directed a pair of documentaries: &quot;The Memphis Belle: A Story of a Flying Fortress&quot; (1944), about a Boeing B-17 and its U.S. Army Air Force crew; and &quot;Thunderbolt!&quot; (1947), highlighting a P-47 fighter-bomber squadron in the Mediterranean. Wyler filmed &quot;The Memphis Belle&quot; at great personal risk, flying over enemy territory on actual bombing missions in 1943; on one flight, Wyler lost consciousness from lack of oxygen. Wyler&#x27;s associate, cinematographer Harold J. Tannenbaum, a First Lieutenant, was shot down and perished during the filming. Director Steven Spielberg describes Wyler&#x27;s filming of &quot;Memphis Belle&quot; in the 2017 Netflix series, &quot;Five Came Back&quot;. Before being assigned to the Air Force, Wyler was hired to direct the documentary &quot;The Negro Soldier&quot; on African-Americans in the United States Armed Forces.

Working on &quot;Thunderbolt!&quot; Wyler was exposed to such loud noise that he passed out. When he awoke, he found he was deaf in one ear. Partial hearing with the aid of a hearing aid eventually came back years later. Wyler returned from the War a lieutenant colonel and a disabled veteran.

Returning from the War and unsure whether he could work again, Wyler turned to a subject that he knew well and directed a film which captured the mood of the nation as it turned to peace after the war, &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; (1946). This story of the homecoming of three veterans from World War II dramatized the problems of returning veterans in their adjustment back to civilian life. Arguably his most personal film, &quot;Best Years&quot; drew on Wyler&#x27;s own experience returning home to his family after three years at the front. &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; won the Academy Award for Best Director (Wyler&#x27;s second) and Academy Award for Best Picture, as well as six other Academy Awards including one Academy Honorary Award.

In 1949, Wyler directed &quot;The Heiress&quot;, which earned Olivia de Havilland her second Oscar and garnered additional Oscars for Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, and Best Music. The film is considered by some to be a highlight in her career, &quot;that could strike envy even in the most versatile and successful actress,&quot; according to one critic.

De Havilland had seen the play in New York and felt she could play the lead perfectly. She then called Wyler to convince him to have Paramount buy the film rights. He flew to New York to see the play and moved by the story,persuaded the studio to buy it. Along with de Havilland, he managed to get Montgomery Clift and Ralph Richardson to co-star.

===1950–1959: Established director ===

In 1951, Wyler produced and directed Kirk Douglas and Eleanor Parker in &quot;Detective Story&quot;, portraying a day in the lives of the various people in a detective squad. Lee Grant and Joseph Wiseman made their screen debuts in the film, which was nominated for four Academy Awards, including one for Grant. Critic Bosley Crowther lauded the film, describing it as &quot;a brisk, absorbing film by producer-director William Wyler, with the help of a fine, responsive cast.&quot;

&quot;Carrie&quot; was released in 1952 starring Jennifer Jones in the title role and Laurence Olivier as Hurstwood. Eddie Albert played Charles Drouet. Carrie received two Academy Award nominations: Costume Design (Edith Head), and Best Art Direction (Hal Pereira, Roland Anderson, Emile Kuri). Wyler was reluctant to cast Jennifer Jones, and the filming was subsequently plagued by a variety of troubles. Jones had not revealed that she was pregnant; Wyler was mourning the death of his year-old son; Olivier had a painful leg ailment, and he developed a dislike for Jones. Hollywood was reeling under the effects of McCarthyism, and the studio was afraid to distribute a film that could be attacked as immoral. Ultimately, the ending was changed and the film was cut to make it more positive in tone.

During the immediate postwar period, Wyler directed a handful of critically acclaimed and influential films. &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; (1953) introduced Audrey Hepburn to U.S. audiences in her first starring role, winning her an Academy Award for Best Actress. Wyler said of Hepburn years later, when describing truly great actresses, &quot;In that league there&#x27;s only ever been Garbo, and the other Hepburn, and maybe Bergman. It&#x27;s a rare quality, but boy, do you know when you&#x27;ve found it.&quot; The film was an instant hit, also winning for Best Costume Design (Edith Head), and Best Writing (Dalton Trumbo). Hepburn would eventually do three movies with Wyler, who her son said was one of the most important directors in her career.

&quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; (1956) was awarded the Palme d&#x27;Or (Golden Palm) at the Cannes Film Festival. And in 1959, Wyler directed &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, which won 11 Oscars, a feat unequaled until &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1997 and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; in 2003. He had also assisted in the production of the 1925 version.

Wyler and its star, Charlton Heston, both knew what the film meant for MGM, which had massive investments in its outcome, with the film&#x27;s budget having gone from $7 million to $15 million, and the fact that MGM was already in dire financial straits. They were aware that if it failed at the box office, MGM might go bankrupt.

The film, like many epics, was difficult to make. When Heston was asked which scene he enjoyed doing most, he said &quot;I didn&#x27;t enjoy any of it. It was hard work.&quot; Part of the reason for that was the financial stress placed on making the film a success. With a cast of fifteen thousand extras, a leading star, and shot on 70mm film with stereophonic tracks, it was the most expensive film ever made at that time. The nine-minute chariot race, for example, took six months to film.

&quot;Ben-Hur&quot; became a great box office success. Wyler won his third Academy Award for Best Director and Charlton Heston his first and only Academy Award as its star. Heston recalled in his autobiography that at first he had doubts about playing the role. But his agent advised him otherwise: &quot;Don&#x27;t you know that actors take parts with Wyler without even reading the damn script? I&#x27;m telling you, you &quot;have&quot; to do this picture!&quot;

Kirk Douglas had lobbied Wyler, who directed him in &quot;Detective Story&quot; in 1951, for the title role, but only after Wyler had already decided on Heston. He offered him instead the role of Messala, which Douglas rejected. Douglas then went on to star in &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1960).

&quot;Ben-Hur&quot; cost $15 million to produce but earned $47 million by the end of 1961 and $90 million worldwide. Audiences mobbed movie theaters in the months after it opened. Critic Pauline Kael praised Wyler&#x27;s achievement:

In 1961, he became a director for 20th Century Fox and also cast James Garner in &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; with Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine. Garner had beaten Warner Bros. in a lawsuit, enabling him to leave the television series &quot;Maverick&quot;, and had been briefly graylisted as a result but Wyler broke the graylist by casting him; the following year, Garner played a leading role in four major motion pictures.

In 1968, he directed Barbra Streisand in her debut film, &quot;Funny Girl&quot;, costarring Omar Sharif, which became a huge financial success. It was nominated for eight Academy Awards, and like Audrey Hepburn in her first starring role, Streisand won as Best Actress, becoming the thirteenth actor to win an Oscar under his direction.

Streisand had already starred in the Broadway musical of &quot;Funny Girl&quot;, with seven hundred performances. And although she knew the part well, Wyler still had to mold her stage role for the screen. She naturally wanted to be involved in the film&#x27;s production, often asking Wyler questions, but they got along well. &quot;Things were ironed out when she discovered some of us knew what we were doing,&quot; kidded Wyler.

What originally attracted him to direct Streisand was similar to what attracted him to Audrey Hepburn, who had also been new to film audiences. He met with Streisand during her musical run and became excited at the prospect of guiding another new star into an award-winning performance. He sensed and admired that Streisand had the same kind of dedication to being an actress as did Bette Davis, early in her career. &quot;It just needed to be controlled and toned down for the movie camera.&quot; Wyler said afterwards, &quot;I&#x27;m terribly fond of her. She was very professional, very good, a hard worker, too hard at times. She would work day and night if you would let her. She is absolutely tireless&quot;.

Wyler was hired to direct &quot;Patton&quot; (1970), but quit before the beginning of production in 1969. The last film Wyler directed was &quot;The Liberation of L.B. Jones&quot;, released in 1970.

==Style and technique ==

=== Visual style ===

Wyler had worked with cinematographer Gregg Toland for six of his films, mostly in the 1930s. Toland used deep focus photographic technique for most of them, whereby he could keep all objects on the screen, whether foreground or background, in sharp focus at the same time. The technique gives the illusion of depth and therefore makes the scene more true to life.

A perfectionist, Wyler earned the nickname &quot;40-take Wyler&quot;. On the set of &quot;Jezebel&quot;, Wyler forced Henry Fonda through 40 takes of one particular scene, his only guidance being &quot;Again!&quot; after each take. When Fonda asked for more direction, Wyler responded, &quot;It stinks.&quot; Similarly, when Charlton Heston quizzed the director about the supposed shortcomings of his performance in &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, Wyler simply told Heston &quot;Be better!&quot; However, Heston notes that by the time a scene is done, regardless of how hard it was to do, it always came off well:

=== Actors&#x27; director ===

He helped propel a number of actors to stardom, including finding and directing Audrey Hepburn in her debut starring role, &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; (1953), and directing Barbra Streisand in her debut film, &quot;Funny Girl&quot; (1968), with both actresses winning Academy Awards. Olivia de Havilland and Bette Davis both won their second Oscars in Wyler films, de Havilland for &quot;The Heiress&quot; (1949) and Davis for &quot;Jezebel&quot; (1938). Davis said Wyler made her a &quot;far, far better actress&quot; than she had ever been, while Laurence Olivier, who received his first Oscar nomination for Wyler&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1939), credited Wyler with teaching him how to act for the screen. Wyler&#x27;s three Best Picture-winning films each featured a Best Actress or Actor Oscar winner – Greer Garson in &quot;Mrs Miniver&quot;, Fredric March in &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;, and Charlton Heston in &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;. Other popular Wyler films include: &quot;The Westerner&quot; (1940) with Gary Cooper, &quot;The Letter&quot; (1940) again with Davis, &quot;Detective Story&quot; (1951) with Kirk Douglas, &quot;Friendly Persuasion&quot; (1956) with Cooper and Dorothy McGuire, &quot;The Big Country&quot; (1958) with Gregory Peck and Heston, &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; (1961) with Hepburn, Shirley MacLaine and James Garner, and &quot;How to Steal a Million&quot; (1966) with Hepburn and Peter O&#x27;Toole.

==Legacy==

Fourteen actors won Oscars under Wyler&#x27;s direction, including Bette Davis in &quot;Jezebel&quot; (1938) and her nomination for &quot;The Letter&quot; (1940). Davis summed up their work together: &quot;It was &quot;he&quot; who helped me to realize my full potential as an actress. I met my match in this exceptionally creative and talented director.&quot;

Other Oscar winners were Olivia de Havilland in &quot;The Heiress&quot; (1949), Audrey Hepburn in her debut film, &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; (1953), Charlton Heston in &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959), and Barbra Streisand in her debut film, &quot;Funny Girl&quot; (1968).

Wyler&#x27;s films garnered more awards for participating artists and actors than any other director in the history of Hollywood. He received 12 Oscar nominations for Best Director, while dozens of his collaborators and actors won Oscars or were nominated. In 1965, Wyler won the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for career achievement. Eleven years later, he received the American Film Institute Life Achievement Award. In addition to his Best Picture and Best Director Oscar wins, 13 of Wyler&#x27;s films earned Best Picture nominations. Other late Wyler films include &quot;The Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; (1961), which was nominated for five Academy Awards. Later films included &quot;The Collector&quot; (1963), &quot;Funny Girl&quot; (1968), and his final film, &quot;The Liberation of L.B. Jones&quot; (1970).

Many of Wyler&#x27;s home movies are held by the Academy Film Archive; the archive preserved a number of them in 2017.

== Personal life and death ==

Wyler was briefly married to actress Margaret Sullavan (from November 25, 1934 – March 13, 1936) and married actress Margaret &quot;Talli&quot; Tallichet on October 23, 1938. The couple remained together until his death. They had five children: Catherine, Judith, William Jr., Melanie and David. Catherine said during an interview that her mother played an important part in his career, often being his &quot;gatekeeper&quot; and his reader of scripts presented to him.

On July 24, 1981, Wyler gave an interview with his daughter, Catherine, for &quot;Directed by William Wyler&quot;, a PBS documentary about his life and career. Three days later, he died of a heart attack. He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial-Park in Glendale, California.

Wyler was a Freemason.

He fluently spoke German, Alsatian, French and English.

==Filmography==

==Honors and awards==

Wyler is the most nominated director in Academy Awards history with twelve nominations. He won the Academy Award for Best Director on three occasions, for &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; (1942), &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot; (1946), and &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; (1959). He is tied with Frank Capra and behind John Ford, who won four Oscars in this category. He is also the only director in Academy history to direct three Best Picture-winning films (the three for which he won Best Director), and shares with Steven Spielberg the record for directing the greatest number of Best Picture nominees (thirteen).

He has the distinction of having directed more actors to Oscar-nominated performances than any other director in history: thirty-six. Out of these nominees, fourteen went on to win Oscars, also a record. He received the fourth AFI Life Achievement Award in 1976. Among those who thanked him for directing her in her debut film, was Barbra Streisand. For his contributions to the motion picture industry, on February 8, 1960, Wyler has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1731 Vine Street. In 1961, Wyler was chosen as one of 50 outstanding Americans of meritorious performance in the fields of endeavor, to be honored as a Guest of Honor to the first annual Banquet of the Golden Plate in Monterey, California. The honor was awarded by vote of the National Panel of Distinguished Americans of the Academy of Achievement.

<text>The family Psittacidae or holotropical parrots is one of three families of true parrots. It comprises the 12 species of subfamily Psittacinae (the Afrotropical parrots) and 167 of subfamily Arinae (the New World or Neotropical parrots) including several species that have gone extinct in recent centuries. Some of the most iconic birds in the world are represented here, such as the blue-and-yellow macaw among the New World parrots and the grey parrot among the Afrotropical parrots.

== Distribution ==
All of the parrot species in this family are found in tropical and subtropical zones and inhabit Mexico, Central and South America, the Caribbean islands, sub-Saharan Africa, the island of Madagascar, the Arabian Peninsula, Southeast Asia, Australia and Oceania. Three parrots, one extinct and another extirpated, once inhabited the United States.

== Evolutionary history ==
This family probably had its origin early in the Paleogene period, 66–23 million years ago (Mya), after the western half of Gondwana had separated into the continents of Africa and South America, before the divergence of African and New World lineages around 30–35 Mya. The New World parrots, and by implication Old World parrots, last shared a common ancestor with the Australian cockatoos in the family the Cacatuidae approximately 33 Mya.

The data place most of the diversification of psittaciformes around 40 Mya, after the separation of Australia from West Antarctica and South America. Divergence of the Psittacidae from the ancestral parrots resulted from a common radiation event from what was then West Antarctica into South America, then Africa, via late Cretaceous land bridges that survived through the Paleogene.

== Taxonomy ==
The family Psittacidae was introduced (as Psittacea) by French polymath Constantine Samuel Rafinesque in 1815. The recently revised taxonomy of the family Psittacidae, based on molecular studies, recognizes the sister clade relationship of the Old World Psittacini and New World Arini tribes of subfamily Psittacinae, which have been raised to subfamily ranking and renamed Psittacinae and Arinae. Subfamily Loriinae and the other tribes of subfamily Psittacinae are now placed in superfamily Psittacoidea of all true parrots, which includes family Psittacidae.

The following phylogeny shows how the family Psittacidae relates to the three other families in the order Psittaciformes. The tree is based on the work by Leo Joseph and collaborators published in 2012 but with the choice of families and the number of species in each family taken from the list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC), now the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union.
The family contains 179 species and is divided into 37 genera. Included are four species that have become extinct in historical times: the glaucous macaw, the Carolina parakeet, the Cuban macaw and the Puerto Rican parakeet. The following cladogram is based on a phylogenetic study by Brian Smith and collaborators that was published in 2023. In the analysis the genera &quot;Nannopsittaca&quot;, &quot;Bolborhynchus&quot; and &quot;Psilopsiagon&quot; were found not to be monophyletic. The number of species in each genus is taken from the IOC list.

<text>Mesotardigrada is one of three classes of tardigrades, consisting of a single species, Thermozodium esakii. The animal reportedly has six claws of equal length at each foot. This species was described in 1937 by German zoologist Gilbert Rahm from a hot spring near Nagasaki, Japan. The inability of taxonomists to replicate Rahm&#x27;s finding has cast doubt on the accuracy of the description, making &quot;T. esakii&quot;, and by extension the entire class Mesotardigrada, a &quot;taxon inquirendum&quot;.

== Taxonomic ambiguity ==

The type specimen Rahm used as the basis of his description has either been lost or it was never preserved in the first place, which Grothman &quot;et al&quot;. (2017) suggest is consistent with the lax taxonomic standards of the 1930s. Thus, re-examination of the original specimen is not possible. Complicating matters further, the type locality from which Rahm collected his specimen may have been destroyed by an earthquake and subsequent searches for additional specimens matching the original description have been unsuccessful.

Grothman &quot;et al.&quot; (2017) suggest that Rahm might have observed and misinterpreted a species in the class Heterotardigrada, possibly belonging to the genus &quot;Carphania&quot; or &quot;Oreella.&quot;

<text>The monarchy of Belgium is the constitutional and hereditary institution of the monarchical head of state of Belgium. As a popular monarchy, the Belgian monarch uses the title king/queen of the Belgians and serves as the country&#x27;s head of state and commander-in-chief of the Belgian Armed Forces. 

There have been seven Belgian monarchs since independence in 1830. The incumbent, Philippe, ascended the throne on 21 July 2013, following the abdication of his father Albert II.

==Origins==

When Belgium gained independence from the United Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1830, the National Congress chose a constitutional monarchy as the form of government. The Congress voted on the question on 22 November 1830, supporting monarchy by 174 votes to 13. In February 1831, the Congress nominated Louis, Duke of Nemours, the son of the French king Louis-Philippe, but international considerations deterred Louis-Philippe from accepting the honour for his son.

Following this refusal, the National Congress appointed Erasme-Louis, Baron Surlet de Chokier to be the Regent of Belgium on 25 February 1831. Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, since 1826 also called &quot;Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha&quot;, was designated as King of the Belgians by the National Congress and swore allegiance to the Belgian constitution in front of Saint James&#x27;s Church at Coudenberg Palace in Brussels on 21 July. This day has since become a national holiday for Belgium and its citizens.

==Hereditary and constitutional==
As a hereditary constitutional monarchy system, the role and operation of Belgium&#x27;s monarchy are governed by the Constitution. The royal office of King is designated solely for a descendant of the first King of the Belgians, Leopold I.

Since he is bound by the Constitution (above all other ideological and religious considerations, political opinions and debates and economic interests) the King is intended to act as an arbiter and guardian of Belgian national unity and independence. Belgium&#x27;s monarchs are inaugurated in a purely civil swearing-in ceremony.

=== Leopold I, Leopold II and Albert I ===
King Leopold I was head of Foreign Affairs &quot;as an &quot;ancien régime&quot; monarch&quot;, the foreign ministers having the authority to act only as ministers of the king. Leopold I quickly became one of the most important shareholders of the &quot;Société Générale de Belgique&quot;.

Leopold&#x27;s son, King Leopold II, is chiefly remembered for the founding and capitalization of the Congo Free State as a personal fiefdom. There was scandal when the atrocities in the Congo Free State were made public, causing the Free State to be taken over by the Belgian Government. Many Congolese were killed as a result of Leopold&#x27;s policies in the Congo before the reforms of direct Belgian rule. The Free State scandal is discussed at the Museum of the Congo at Tervuren in Belgium.

On several occasions Leopold II publicly expressed disagreement with the ruling government (e.g. on 15 August 1887, and in 1905, against Prime Minister Auguste Beernaert) and was accused by Yvon Gouet of noncompliance with the country&#x27;s parliamentary system.

Leopold II died without surviving legitimate sons. The line now descends from his nephew and successor, Albert I of Belgium, who ruled while 90% of Belgium was overrun by the forces of Kaiser Wilhelm II and is notable for his forays into colonial rule of the Belgian Congo and later, abeyant Wilhelm, the League of Nations mandate in Ruanda-Urundi. In 1934, Albert died under mysterious circumstances as he climbed solo on the Roche du Vieux Bon Dieu at Marche-les-Dames.

=== Leopold III and Baudouin ===
Louis Wodon (the of Leopold III from 1934 to 1940), thought the King&#x27;s oath to the Constitution implied a royal position &quot;over and above the Constitution&quot;. He compared the King to a father, the head of a family: &quot;Regarding the moral mission of the king, it is permissible to point to a certain analogy between his role and that of a father, or more generally, of parents in a family. The family is, of course, a legal institution as is the state. But what would a family be where everything was limited among those who compose it to simply legal relationships? In a family when one considers only legal relationships one comes very close to a breakdown in the moral ties founded on reciprocal affection without which a family would be like any other fragile association&quot; According to Arango, Leopold III of Belgium shared these views about the Belgian monarchy.

In 1991, towards the end of the reign of Baudouin, Senator Yves de Wasseige, a former member of the Belgian Constitutional Court, cited four points at which the Belgian Constitution lacks democracy:
# the King chooses the ministers,
# the King is able to influence the ministers when he speaks with them about bills, projects and nominations,
# the King promulgates bills, and,
# the King must agree to any change of the Constitution

=== Constitutional, political, and historical consequences ===
The Belgian monarchy was from the beginning a constitutional monarchy, patterned after that of the United Kingdom. Raymond Fusilier wrote the Belgian regime of 1830 was also inspired by the French Constitution of the Kingdom of France (1791–1792), the United States Declaration of Independence of 1776, and the old political traditions of both Walloon and Flemish provinces. &quot;It should be observed that all monarchies have suffered periods of change as a result of which the power of the sovereign was reduced, but for the most part those periods occurred before the development of the system of constitutional monarchy and were steps leading to its establishment.&quot; The characteristic evidence of this is in Great Britain where there was an evolution from the time when kings ruled through the agency of ministers to that time when ministers began to govern through the instrumentality of the Crown.

Unlike the British constitutional system, in Belgium &quot;the monarchy underwent a belated evolution&quot; which came &quot;after the establishment of the constitutional monarchical system&quot; because, in 1830–1831, an independent state, parliamentary system and monarchy were established simultaneously. Hans Daalder, professor of political science at the Rijksuniversiteit Leiden wrote: &quot;Did such simultaneous developments not result in a possible failure to lay down the limits of the royal prerogatives with some precision—which implied that the view of the King as the Keeper of the Nation, with rights and duties of its own, retained legitimacy?&quot;

For Raymond Fusilier, the Belgian monarchy had to be placed—at least in the beginning—between the regimes where the king rules and those in which the king does not rule but only reigns. The Belgian monarchy is closer to the principle &quot;the King does not rule&quot;, but the Belgian kings were not only &quot;at the head of the dignified part of the Constitution&quot;. The Belgian monarchy is not merely symbolic, because it participates in directing affairs of state insofar as the King&#x27;s will coincides with that of the ministers, who alone bear responsibility for the policy of government. For Francis Delpérée, to reign does not only mean to preside over ceremonies but also to take a part in the running of the State. The Belgian historian Jean Stengers wrote that &quot;some foreigners believe the monarchy is indispensable to national unity. That is very naive. He is only a piece on the chessboard, but a piece which matters&quot;.

==List of kings of the Belgians==

The monarchs of Belgium originally belonged to the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. The family name was changed by Albert I in 1920, to the House of Belgium and the armorial bearings of Saxony from the House of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha were removed from the Belgian royal coat of arms.

In 2019, the King Phillippe codified the coats of arms of himself and those of his family through a Royal Decree. The personal arms of the reigning monarch was modified to include the Saxonian escutcheon. The arms of other members of the royal family was similarly modified. The reinstatement of the shield of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha into the royal arms occurred shortly after the visit of the king and queen to the ancestral Friedenstein Castle. The latest royal decree therefore reverses previous changes made to the Royal versions of the coat arms which removed the armorial bearings of Saxony during the First World War. By including the three official languages in the motto it reflects his wish &quot;to be the King of the whole Kingdom and of all Belgians&quot;.;. The national Coat of arms of Belgium remains unchanged, i.e. it does not incorporate the Saxon arms.

Since the 2017, Carnet Mondain, the title &quot;Saxe-Cobourg-Gotha&quot;, along with &quot;of Belgium&quot; is again in use for all the descendants of Leopold I, with the exception of King Philippe, his wife, his sister and his brother who keep their title &quot;of Belgium&quot;; therefore the descendants of Astrid of Belgium do not bear this title, but that of &quot;of Austria-Este&quot; of their father.

For completeness, the family tree should include Princess Delphine of Belgium (born 1968). Princess Delphine is the legally acknowledged half-sibling of King Philippe of Belgium, and her children are also recognised as members of the royal family. 
==Title==
The proper title of the Belgian monarch is &quot;King of the &quot;Belgians&quot;&quot; rather than &quot;King of &quot;Belgium&quot;&quot; as is common for other monarchies throughout Europe. The title is linked to a concept of &quot;popular monarchy&quot; as defined by Kingsley Martin in his work &quot;The Evolution of Popular Monarchy&quot;, published in 1936. According to Martin, the term is meant to emphasize the bond and connection to the people of the land over the territory the state controls. His work further implies that such a monarch is &quot;de facto&quot; appointed by the people as a nominal figurehead rather than being an authoritarian ruler.

Belgium is the only extant European monarchy in which the heir to the throne does not ascend immediately upon the death or abdication of his or her predecessor. According to Article 91 of the Belgian constitution, the heir accedes to the throne only upon taking a constitutional oath before a joint session of the two Houses of Parliament. The joint session has to be held within ten days of the death or abdication of the previous monarch. The new Belgian monarch is required to take the Belgian constitutional oath, &quot;I swear to observe the Constitution and the laws of the Belgian people, to maintain the national independence and the integrity of the territory,&quot; which is uttered in the three official languages: French, Dutch, and German.

Members of the Belgian royal family are often known by two names: a Dutch and a French one. For example, the current monarch is called &#x27;Philippe&#x27; in French and &#x27;Filip&#x27; in Dutch; the fifth King of the Belgians was &#x27;Baudouin&#x27; in French and &#x27;Boudewijn&#x27; in Dutch.

In contrast to King Philippe&#x27;s title of &quot;King of the Belgians&quot;, Princess Elisabeth is called &quot;Princess &quot;of Belgium&quot;&quot; as the title &quot;Prince of the Belgians&quot; does not exist. She is also Duchess of Brabant, the traditional title of the heir apparent to the Belgian throne. This title precedes the title &quot;Princess of Belgium&quot;.

In the other official language of German, monarchs are usually referred to by their French names. The same is true for English with the exception of Leopold, where the accent is removed for the purpose of simplicity.

Because of the First World War and the resultant strong anti-German sentiment, the family name was changed in 1920, from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to &quot;van België, de Belgique&quot;, or &quot;von Belgien&quot; (&quot;of Belgium&quot;), depending upon which of the country&#x27;s three official languages (Dutch, French, and German) is in use. It is this family name which is used on the identity cards and in all official documents by Belgium&#x27;s royalty (e.g. marriage licenses). In addition to this change of name, the armorial bearings of Saxony were removed from the Belgian royal coat of arms (see above). Other Coburgers from the multi-branched Saxe-Coburg family have also changed their name, such as George V, who adopted the family name of Windsor after the British royal family&#x27;s place of residence. Only Simeon Sakskoburggotski kept his Saxony-Coburg family name, but he was ousted from the Bulgarian throne in 1946 at the age of nine.

Nevertheless, the Royal Decree published on 19 July and signed on 12 July 2019 by King Philip, reinstated the Saxonian escutcheon in the all royal versions of the family&#x27;s coat of arms. The reinstatement of the Saxe-Coburg-Gotha main royal arms occurred shortly after the visit of King Philip and Queen Mathilde to the ancestral Friedenstein Castle.

==Constitutional role==
The Belgian monarchy symbolises and maintains a feeling of national unity by representing the country in public functions and international meetings.

In addition, the monarch has a number of responsibilities in the process of the formation of the Government. The procedure usually begins with the nomination of the &quot;Informateur&quot; by the monarch. After the general election the Informateur officially informs the monarch of the main political formations which may be available for governance. After this phase, the monarch can appoint another &quot;informateur&quot; or appoint a &quot;Formateur&quot;, who will have the charge of forming a new government, of which he or she generally becomes the Prime Minister.

Article 37 of the Constitution of Belgium vests the &quot;federal executive power&quot; in the monarch. Under Section III, this power includes the appointment and dismissal of ministers, the implementation of the laws passed by the Federal Parliament, the submission of bills to the Federal Parliament and the management of international relations. The monarch sanctions and promulgates all laws passed by Parliament. In accordance with Article 106 of the Belgian Constitution, the monarch is required to exercise his powers through the ministers. His acts are not valid without the countersignature of the responsible minister, who in doing so assumes political responsibility for the act in question. This means that federal executive power is exercised in practice by the Federal Government, which is accountable to the Chamber of Representatives in accordance with Article 101 of the Constitution.

The monarch receives the prime minister at the Palace of Brussels at least once a week, and also regularly calls other members of the government to the palace in order to discuss political matters. During these meetings, the monarch has the right to be informed of proposed governmental policies, the right to advise, and the right to warn on any matter as the monarch sees fit. The monarch also holds meetings with the leaders of all the major political parties and regular members of parliament. All of these meetings are organised by the monarch&#x27;s personal political cabinet which is part of the Royal Household.

The monarch is the Commander-in-Chief of the Belgian Armed Forces and makes appointments to the higher positions. The names of the nominees are sent to the monarch by the Ministry of Defence. The monarch&#x27;s military duties are carried out with the help of the Military Household which is headed by a General office. Belgians may write to the monarch when they meet difficulties with administrative powers.

The monarch is also one of the three components of the federal legislative power, in accordance with the Belgian Constitution, together with the two chambers of the Federal Parliament: the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate. All laws passed by the Federal Parliament must be signed and promulgated by the monarch.

Previously, children of the King were entitled to a seat in the senate (Senator by right) when they were 18. This right was abolished in 2014 as part of the Sixth Belgian state reform.

===Inviolability===

The Inviolability of Monarchy is a legal principle in Belgium that protects the King or Queen from legal prosecution, civil or criminal, during their reign. This principle is enshrined in Article 88 of the Belgian Constitution.

According to this principle, the King or Queen cannot be held responsible for their actions as monarch, nor can they be subjected to legal proceedings during their reign. This is intended to ensure that the monarch can perform their duties without fear of political interference or retribution.

However, it is important to note that the principle of inviolability does not extend to the actions of the monarch outside of their official duties. If a monarch commits a crime or engages in unlawful activities outside of their role as head of state, they can still be held legally accountable for their actions.

In Belgium, the principle of inviolability is seen as an important safeguard for the constitutional monarchy, which is a key component of the country&#x27;s political system. It is also seen as a way to ensure that the monarch can act as a unifying figure for the country, representing all Belgians regardless of political affiliation or ideology.

Overall, the principle of inviolability of the monarchy in Belgium is a key feature of the country&#x27;s political system, designed to protect the monarch and preserve the stability of the constitutional monarchy.

=== Traditions ===
The Court still keeps some old traditions, most famous is the tradition that the Reigning King of the Belgians becomes the godfather of a seventh son and the Queen the godmother of a seventh daughter. The child is then given the name of the Sovereign and receives a gift from the palace and Burgomaster of the city.
Similar traditions are attached to the Russian Tsar and the President of Argentina.
Another tradition is the centuries-old ceremonial welcome the new king receives in the country during the Joyous Entry; this tradition apparently dates back to the Dukes of Brabant.

==Popular support==
Popular support for the monarchy had historically been higher in Flanders and lower in Wallonia. The generally pro-monarchy Catholic Party and later Christian Social Party dominated in Flanders, while the more industrialised Wallonia had more support for the Belgian Labour Party and later Socialist Party. For example, the 1950 referendum saw Flanders voting strongly in favour of King Leopold III returning, whereas Wallonia was largely against. However, in recent decades these roles have reversed, as religiosity in Flanders has decreased and the King is seen as protecting the country against (Flemish) separatism and the country&#x27;s partition.

==Royal Household==

The King&#x27;s Household (, , ) was reorganised in 2006, and consists of seven autonomous departments and the Court&#x27;s Steering Committee. Each Head of Department is responsible for his department and is accountable to the King.

The following departments currently make up the King&#x27;s Household:
*the Department for Economic, Social and Cultural Affairs
*the King&#x27;s Cabinet
*the King&#x27;s Military Household
*the King&#x27;s Civil List
*the Department for Foreign Relations
*the Department of the Protocol of the Court
*the Department of Petitions

The King&#x27;s Chief of Cabinet is responsible for dealing with political and administrative matters and for maintaining the relations with the government, trade unions and industrial circles. In relation to the King, the Chief assists in keeping track of current events; informs regarding all aspects of Belgian life; proposes and prepares audiences; assists in preparing speeches and informs the King about developments in international affairs. The Chief of Cabinet is assisted by the Deputy and Legal Adviser, the Press Adviser and the Archivist. The incumbent Chief of Cabinet is Baron Frans Van Daele, former Chief of Cabinet of President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy.

The Head of the King&#x27;s Military Household assists the King in fulfilling his duties in the field of defence. He informs the King about all matters of security, defence policy, the views of Belgium&#x27;s main partner countries and all aspects of the Belgian Armed Forces. He organises the King&#x27;s contacts with the Armed Forces, advises in the fields of scientific research and police and coordinates matters with patriotic associations and former service personnel. The Military Household is also responsible for managing the Palace&#x27;s computer system. The Head of the Military Household is a General Officer, currently General Jef Van den put and assisted by an adviser, currently Lieutenant-Colonel Aviator Serge Vassart. The King&#x27;s Aides-de-Camp and the King&#x27;s Equerries are also attached to the Military Household.

The King&#x27;s &quot;aides-de-camp&quot; are senior officers chosen by the monarch and charged with carrying out certain tasks on his behalf, such as representing him at events. The King&#x27;s Equerries are young officers who take turns preparing the King&#x27;s activities, informing him about all the aspects that may be important to him and providing any other useful services such as announcing visitors. The equerry accompanies the King on his trips except for those of a strictly private nature.

The Intendant of the King&#x27;s Civil List is responsible for managing the material, financial and human resources of the King&#x27;s Household. He is assisted by the Commandant of the Royal Palaces, the Treasurer of the King&#x27;s Civil List and the Civil List Adviser. The Intendant of the Civil List also advises the King in the field of energy, sciences and culture and administers the King&#x27;s hunting rights. The Commandant of the Royal Palaces is mainly in charge, in close cooperation with the Chief of Protocol, of the logistic support of activities and the maintenance and cleaning of the Palaces, Castles and Residences. He is also Director of the Royal Hunts.

The Chief of Protocol is charged with organising the public engagements of the King and the Queen, such as audiences, receptions and official banquets at the Palace, as well as formal activities outside of the Palace. He is assisted by the Queen&#x27;s Secretary, who is mainly responsible for proposing and preparing the Queen&#x27;s audiences and visits.

The Head of the Department for Economic, Social and Cultural Affairs advises the King in the economic, social and cultural fields. He is also responsible for providing coordination between the various Households and Services and for organising and minuting the meetings of the Steering Committee. The Head of the Department for Foreign Relations informs the King of developments in international policy, assists the King from a diplomatic viewpoint on royal visits abroad and prepares the King&#x27;s audiences in the international field. He is also responsible for maintaining contacts with foreign diplomatic missions. The Head of the Department of Petitions is charged with processing petitions and requests for social aid addressed the King, the Queen or other members of the royal family. He is also responsible for the analysis and coordination of royal favours and activities relating to jubilees, and advises the King in the fields for which he is responsible.

For the personal protection of the King and the royal family, as well as for the surveillance of the royal estates, the Belgian Federal Police at all times provides a security detail to the Royal Palace, commanded by a chief police commissioner. The other members of the royal family have a service at their disposal.

==Royal family ==

Members of the Belgian royal family, other than the monarch, hold the title of Prince or Princess of Belgium, with the style of Royal Highness. Prior to the First World War, they used the additional titles of Prince or Princess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Duke or Duchess of Saxony, as members of the House of Wettin.

The title Prince or Princess of Belgium is a specific noble title within the Belgian nobility reserved for members of the Belgian royal family. Originally the Royal Decree of 14 March 1891, reserved this title for all persons descending in the direct male line from king Leopold I. The royal decree also automatically granted the title to the princesses who joined the Belgian royal family by their marriage to a Prince of Belgium. This royal decree was amended by the Royal Decree of 2 December 1991, which reserved the title for the direct male and female descendants of Albert II and abolished the Salic Law with regards to its granting. The Royal Decree of 12 November 2015, published in the Belgian official journal on 24 November 2015, abolished the aforementioned Royal Decree of 1991, and restricts new grants of this title to the children and grandchildren of the reigning monarch, and to the children and grandchildren of the crownprince(ss). The spouse of a Prince or Princess of Belgium is no longer automatically granted the title but he or she can still be granted the title by royal decree on an individual basis. Prior to this, all descendants of Albert II were entitled to the title of prince or princess.

King Philippe (born 15 April 1960) is King of the Belgians. He married, on 4 December 1999, &quot;Jonkvrouwe&quot; Mathilde d&#x27;Udekem d&#x27;Acoz, who was created Princess Mathilde of Belgium a day before their wedding, after which she also took the title Duchess of Brabant as the wife of the Duke of Brabant, and became, from 21 July 2013, Queen Mathilde of the Belgians. She is a daughter of Patrick d&#x27;Udekem d&#x27;Acoz (made a count prior to the wedding) and his wife, Countess Anna Maria Komorowska. They have four children:
*Princess Elisabeth, Duchess of Brabant, who will inherit the throne after her father due to a 1991 act of succession which established absolute (gender-neutral) primogeniture, altering the order of succession from &quot;eldest son&quot; to &quot;eldest child&quot;.

<text>Ben Hecht (; February 28, 1894 – April 18, 1964) was an American screenwriter, director, producer, playwright, journalist, and novelist. A journalist in his youth, he went on to write 35 books and some of the most enjoyed screenplays and plays in America. He received screen credits, alone or in collaboration, for the stories or screenplays of some seventy films.

After graduating from high school in 1910, Hecht ran away to Chicago, where, in his own words, he &quot;haunted streets, whorehouses, police stations, courtrooms, theater stages, jails, saloons, slums, madhouses, fires, murders, riots, banquet halls, and bookshops.&quot; In the 1910s and 1920s, Hecht became a noted journalist, foreign correspondent, and literary figure. In the late 1920s, his co-authored, reporter-themed play, &quot;The Front Page&quot;, became a Broadway hit.
The &quot;Dictionary of Literary Biography – American Screenwriters&quot; calls him &quot;one of the most successful screenwriters in the history of motion pictures&quot;. Hecht received the first Academy Award for Best Story for &quot;Underworld&quot; (1927). Many of the screenplays he worked on are now considered classics. He also provided story ideas for such films as &quot;Stagecoach&quot; (1939). Film historian Richard Corliss called him &quot;&quot;the&quot; Hollywood screenwriter&quot;, someone who &quot;personified Hollywood itself&quot;. In 1940, he wrote, produced, and directed &quot;Angels Over Broadway&quot;, which was nominated for Best Screenplay. In total, six of his movie screenplays were nominated for Academy Awards, with two winning.

Hecht became an active Zionist after meeting Peter Bergson, who came to the United States near the start of World War II. Motivated by what became the Holocaust—the mass-murder of Jews in Europe—Hecht wrote articles and plays, such as &quot;We Will Never Die&quot; in 1943 and &quot;A Flag is Born&quot; in 1946. Thereafter, he wrote many screenplays anonymously to avoid a British boycott of his work in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The boycott was a response to Hecht&#x27;s active support of paramilitary action against British Mandate for Palestine forces, during which time a Zionist force&#x27;s supply ship to Palestine was named the S.S. &quot;Ben Hecht&quot; (nl)(he).

In 1954, Hecht published his highly regarded autobiography, &quot;A Child of the Century&quot;. According to it, he did not hold screenwriting (in contrast to journalism) in high esteem, and never spent more than eight weeks on a script. In 1983, 19 years after his death, Ben Hecht was posthumously inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame.

==Early years==
Hecht was born in New York City, the son of Belarusian-Jewish immigrants. His father, Joseph Hecht, worked in the garment industry. His father and mother, Sarah Swernofsky Hecht, had emigrated to New York from Minsk, Russian Empire. The Hechts married in 1892.

The family moved to Racine, Wisconsin, where Ben attended high school. For his bar mitzvah, his parents bought him four crates full of the works of Shakespeare, Dickens and Twain. When Hecht was in his early teens, he would spend the summers with an uncle in Chicago. On the road much of the time, his father did not have much effect on Hecht&#x27;s childhood, and his mother was busy managing a store in downtown Racine. Film author Scott Siegal wrote, &quot;He was considered a child prodigy at age ten, seemingly on his way to a career as a concert violinist, but two years later was performing as a circus acrobat&quot;.

After graduating from Racine High School in 1910, Hecht attended the University of Wisconsin for three days before leaving for Chicago at the age of 16 or 17. He lived with relatives, and started a career in journalism. He won a job with the &quot;Chicago Daily Journal&quot; after writing a profane poem for publisher John C. Eastman to entertain guests at a party. By age seventeen Hecht was a full-time reporter, first with the &quot;Daily Journal&quot;, and later with the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;. He was an excellent reporter who worked on several Chicago papers. In the aftermath of World War I, Hecht was sent to cover Berlin for the &quot;Daily News&quot;. While there he also wrote his first and most successful novel, &quot;Erik Dorn&quot; (1921). It was a sensational debut for Hecht as a serious writer.

The 1969 movie, &quot;Gaily, Gaily&quot;, directed by Norman Jewison and starring Beau Bridges as &quot;Ben Harvey&quot;, was based on Hecht&#x27;s life during his early years working as a reporter in Chicago. The film was nominated for three Oscars. The story was taken from a portion of his autobiography, &quot;A Child of the Century&quot;.

==Writing career==

===Journalist===

From 1918 to 1919, Hecht served as war correspondent in Berlin for the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;. According to Barbara and Scott Siegel, &quot;Besides being a war reporter, he was noted for being a tough crime reporter while also becoming known in Chicago literary circles&quot;.

In 1921, Hecht inaugurated a &quot;Daily News&quot; column, &quot;One Thousand and One Afternoons in Chicago&quot;. While it lasted, the column was enormously influential. His editor, Henry Justin Smith, later said it represented a new concept in journalism: 
While at the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;, Hecht famously broke the 1921 &quot;Ragged Stranger Murder Case&quot; story, about the murder of Carl Wanderer&#x27;s wife, which led to the trial and execution of war hero Carl Wanderer. In Chicago, he also met and befriended Maxwell Bodenheim, an American poet and novelist, later known as the King of Greenwich Village Bohemians, and with whom he became a lifelong friend.

After concluding &quot;One Thousand and One Afternoons&quot;, Hecht went on to produce novels, plays, screenplays, and memoirs, but for him, none of these eclipsed his early success in finding the stuff of literature in city life. Recalling that period, Hecht wrote, &quot;I haunted streets, whorehouses, police stations, courtrooms, theater stages, jails, saloons, slums, madhouses, fires, murders, riots, banquet halls, and bookshops. I ran everywhere in the city like a fly buzzing in the works of a clock, tasted more than any fit belly could hold, learned not to sleep, and buried myself in a tick-tock of whirling hours that still echo in me&quot;.

===Novelist and short-story writer===

Besides working as reporter in Chicago, &quot;he also contributed to literary magazines including the [his friend, Margaret C. Anderson&#x27;s] &quot;Little Review&quot;. After World War I he was sent by the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot; to Berlin to witness the revolutionary movements, which gave him the material for his first novel, &quot;Erik Dorn&quot; (1921). ... A daily column he wrote, &quot;1001 Afternoons in Chicago&quot;, was later collected into a book, and brought Hecht fame&quot;. These works enhanced his reputation in the literary scene as a reporter, columnist, short story writer, and novelist. After leaving the &quot;News&quot; in 1923, he started his own newspaper, The &quot;Chicago Literary Times&quot;.
According to biographer Eddy Applegate, &quot;Hecht read voraciously the works of Gautier, Baudelaire, Mallarmé, and Verlaine, and developed a style that was extraordinary and imaginative. The use of metaphor, imagery, and vivid phrases made his writing distinct ... again and again Hecht showed an uncanny ability to picture the strange jumble of events in strokes as vivid and touching as the brushmarks of a novelist&quot;.

&quot;Ben Hecht was the enfant terrible of American letters in the first half of the twentieth century&quot;, wrote author Sanford Sternlicht. &quot;If Hecht was consistently opposed to anything, it was to censorship of literature, art, and film by either the government or self-appointed guardians of public morality&quot;. He adds, &quot;Even though he never attended college, Hecht became a successful novelist, playwright, journalist, and screenwriter. His star has sunk below the horizon now, but in his own lifetime Hecht became one of the most famous American literary and entertainment figures&quot;.

Eventually Hecht became associated with the writers Sherwood Anderson, Theodore Dreiser, Maxwell Bodenheim, Carl Sandburg, and Pascal Covici. He knew Margaret Anderson, and contributed to her &quot;Little Review&quot;, the magazine of the Chicago &quot;literary renaissance&quot;, and to &quot;Smart Set&quot;.

;&quot;A Child of the Century&quot;
In 1954, Hecht published his autobiography, &quot;A Child of the Century&quot;, which, according to literary critic Robert Schmuhl, &quot;received such extensive critical acclaim that his literary reputation improved markedly during the last decade of his life ... Hecht&#x27;s vibrant and candid memoir of more than six hundred pages restored him to the stature of a serious and significant American writer&quot;. Novelist Saul Bellow reviewed the book for &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;His manners are not always nice, but then nice manners do not always make interesting autobiographies, and this autobiography has the merit of being intensely interesting ... If he is occasionally slick, he is also independent, forthright, and original. Among the pussycats who write of social issues today, he roars like an old-fashioned lion.&quot; In 2011, Richard Corliss, announced the &quot;Time&quot; editorial board named Hecht&#x27;s autobiography to the &quot;Time&quot; 100 best non-fiction books list (books published since the founding of the magazine in 1923).

&quot;New Yorker&quot; film critic David Denby begins a discussion of Hecht&#x27;s screenwriting by recounting a long story from his autobiography. He then asks, &quot;How many of these details are true? It&#x27;s impossible to say, but truth, in this case, may not be the point. As Norman Mailer noted in 1973, Hecht &#x27;was never a writer to tell the truth when a concoction could put life in his prose. Denby calls this Hecht&#x27;s &quot;gift for confabulated anecdote&quot;. Near the end of the article, Denby returns to &quot;A Child of the Century&quot;, &quot;that vast compendium of period evocation, juiced anecdotes, and dubious philosophy&quot;.

;Ghostwriting Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s biography
Besides working on novels and short stories (see book list), he has been credited with ghostwriting books, including Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s autobiography &quot;My Story&quot;. &quot;The reprint of Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s memoir, &quot;My Story&quot;, in 2000, by Cooper Square Press, correctly credits Hecht as an author, ending a period of almost fifty years in which Hecht&#x27;s role was denied ... Hecht himself, however, kept denying it publicly&quot;.

According to her biographer, Sarah Churchwell, Monroe was &quot;persuaded to capitalize on her newfound celebrity by beginning an autobiography. It was born out of a collaboration with journalist and screenwriter Ben Hecht, hired as a ghostwriter&quot;. Churchwell adds that the facts in her story were highly selective. &quot;Hecht reported to his editor during the interviews that he was sometimes sure Marilyn was fabricating. He explained, &#x27;When I say lying, I mean she isn&#x27;t telling the truth. I don&#x27;t think so much that she is trying to deceive me as that she is a fantasizer.

===Playwright===
Beginning with a series of one-acts in 1914, he began writing plays. His first full-length play was &quot;The Egotist&quot;, and it was produced in New York in 1922. While living in Chicago, he met fellow reporter Charles MacArthur and together they moved to New York to collaborate on their Chicago-crime-reporter themed play, &quot;The Front Page&quot;. It was widely acclaimed and had a successful run on Broadway of 281 performances, beginning August 1928. In 1931, it was turned into a successful film, which was nominated for three Oscars.

===Screenwriter===

Film historian Richard Corliss writes, &quot;Ben Hecht was &quot;the&quot; Hollywood screenwriter ... [and] it can be said without too much exaggeration that Hecht personifies Hollywood itself.&quot; Movie columnist Pauline Kael says, &quot;between them, Hecht and Jules Furthman wrote most of the best American talkies&quot;. His movie career can be defined by about twenty credited screenplays he wrote for Hawks, Hitchcock, Hathaway, Lubitsch, Wellman, Sternberg, and himself. He wrote many of those with his two regular collaborators, Charles MacArthur and Charles Lederer.

While living in New York in 1926, he received a telegram from screenwriter friend Herman J. Mankiewicz, who had recently moved to Los Angeles. &quot;Will you accept three hundred per week to work for Paramount Pictures. All expenses paid. The three hundred is peanuts. Millions are to be grabbed out here, and your only competition is idiots&quot;, it read. &quot;Don&#x27;t let this get around.&quot; As a writer in need of money, he traveled to Hollywood as Mankiewicz suggested.

;Working in Hollywood
He arrived in Los Angeles and began his career at the beginning of the sound era by writing the story for Josef von Sternberg&#x27;s gangster movie &quot;Underworld&quot; in 1927. For that first screenplay and story, he won an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay in Hollywood&#x27;s first Academy award ceremony. Soon afterward, he became the &quot;most prolific and highest paid screenwriter in Hollywood&quot;.

Hecht spent from two to twelve weeks in Hollywood each year, &quot;during which he earned enough money (his record was $100,000 in one month, for two screenplays) to live on for the rest of the year in New York, where he did what he considered his serious writing&quot;, writes film historian Carol Easton. Nonetheless, later in his career, &quot;he was a writer who liked to think that his genius had been stifled by Hollywood and by its dreadful habit of giving him so much money&quot;.

Yet his income was as much a result of his skill as a writer as well as his early jobs with newspapers. As film historians Mast and Kawin wrote, &quot;The newspaper reporters often seemed like gangsters who had accidentally ended up behind a typewriter rather than a tommy gun; they talked and acted as rough as the crooks their assignments forced them to cover ... It is no accident that Ben Hecht, the greatest screenwriter of rapid-fire, flavorful tough talk, as well as a major comic playwright, wrote gangster pictures, prison pictures, and newspaper pictures.&quot;

Hecht became one of Hollywood&#x27;s most prolific screenwriters, able to write a full screenplay in two to eight weeks. According to Samuel Goldwyn biographer, Carol Easton, in 1931, with his writing partner Charles MacArthur, he &quot;knocked out &quot;The Unholy Garden&quot; in twelve hours. Hecht subsequently received a fan letter from producer Arthur Hornblow, Jr.:

It was produced exactly as written, and &#x27;became one of the biggest, yet funniest, bombs ever made by a studio&#x27;.&quot;

;Censorship, profit, and art
Despite his monetary success, however, Hecht always kept Hollywood at arms&#x27; length. According to film historian Gregory Black, &quot;he did not consider his work for the movies serious art; it was more a means of replenishing his bank account. When his work was finished, he retreated to New York.&quot;

At least part of the reason for this was due to the industry&#x27;s system of censorship. Black writes, &quot;as Mankiewicz, Selznick, and Hecht knew all too well, much of the blame for the failure of the movies to deal more frankly and honestly with life, lay with a rigid censorship imposed on the industry ... [and] on the content of films during its golden era of studio production.&quot; Because the costs of production and distribution were so high, the primary &quot;goal of the studios was profit, not art ... [and] fearful of losing any segment of their audiences, the studios either carefully avoided controversial topics or presented them in a way that evaded larger issues&quot;, thereby creating only &quot;harmless entertainment&quot;.

According to historian David Thomson, &quot;to their own minds, Herman Mankiewicz and Ben Hecht both died morose and frustrated. Neither of them had written the great books they believed possible.&quot;

;with Howard Hawks
In an interview with director Howard Hawks, with whom Hecht worked on many films, Scott Breivold elicited comments on the way they often worked:

;with David O. Selznick
According to film historian Virginia Wexman,

&quot;Nothing Sacred&quot; is probably the &quot;most famous of all the Carole Lombard films next to &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot;&quot;, wrote movie historian James Harvey. And it impressed people at the time with its evident ambition &quot;and Selznick determined to make the classiest of all screwball comedies, turned to Lombard as a necessity, but also to Ben Hecht, nearly the hottest screenwriter in Hollywood at the time, especially for comedy. ... it was also the first screwball comedy to lay apparent claim to larger satiric meanings, to make scathing observations about American life and society.&quot;

In an interview with Irene Selznick, ex-wife of producer David O. Selznick, she discussed the other leading screenwriters of that time:

;with Ernst Lubitsch
According to James Harvey, Ernst Lubitsch felt uneasy in the world of playwright Noël Coward.

===Styles of writing===
According to Siegel, &quot;The talkie era put writers like Hecht at a premium because they could write dialogue in the quirky, idiosyncratic style of the common man. Hecht, in particular, was wonderful with slang, and he peppered his films with the argot of the streets. He also had a lively sense of humor and an uncanny ability to ground even the most outrageous stories successfully with credible, fast-paced plots.&quot; Hecht, his friend Budd Schulberg wrote many years ago, &quot;seemed the personification of the writer at the top of his game, the top of his world, not gnawing at doubting himself as great writers were said to do, but with every word and every gesture indicating the animal pleasure he took in writing well&quot;.

&quot;Movies&quot;, Hecht was to recall, &quot;were seldom written. In 1927, they were yelled into existence in conferences that kept going in saloons, brothels, and all-night poker games. Movie sets roared with arguments and organ music.&quot;

He was best known for two specific and contrasting types of film: crime thrillers and screwball comedies. Among crime thrillers, Hecht was responsible for such films as &quot;The Unholy Night&quot; (1929), the classic &quot;Scarface&quot; (1932), and Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Notorious&quot;. Among his comedies, there were &quot;The Front Page&quot;, which led to many remakes, Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Design for Living&quot; (1933), &quot;Twentieth Century&quot;, &quot;Nothing Sacred&quot;, and Howard Hawks&#x27;s &quot;Monkey Business&quot; (1952).

Film historian Richard Corliss wrote, &quot;it is his crisp, frenetic, sensational prose and dialogue style that elevates his work above that of the dozens of other reporters who streamed west to cover and exploit Hollywood&#x27;s biggest &#x27;story&#x27;: the talkie revolution.&quot;

==Personal life==

===Married life===
He married Marie Armstrong (1892–1956), a gentile, in 1915, when he was 21, and they had a daughter, Edwina (1916–1991), who would grow up to be an actress. He later met Rose Caylor, a writer, and together they left Chicago (and his family) in 1924, moving to New York. He was divorced from Armstrong in 1925. He married Caylor that same year, and they remained married until Hecht&#x27;s death in 1964.

On July 30, 1943, Ben and Rose had a daughter, Jenny Hecht, who became an actress at the age of 8. She died of a drug overdose on March 25, 1971, at the age of 27, shortly after completing her third movie appearance. A play about Jenny&#x27;s brief life, &quot;The Screenwriter&#x27;s Daughter&quot; by Larry Mollin, was staged in London in October 2015.

===Civil rights activism===
According to Hecht historian Florice Whyte Kovan, he became active in promoting civil rights early in his career.

===Supporting allies during World War II===
Hecht was among a number of signers of a formal statement, issued in July 1941, calling for the &quot;utmost material assistance by our government to England, the Soviet Union, and China&quot;. Among those who signed were former Nobel Prize winners in science and other people eminent in education, literature, and the arts. It advocated

Later that year, he had his first large-scale musical collaboration with symphonic composer Ferde Grofe on their patriotic cantata, &quot;Uncle Sam Stands Up&quot;.

===Jewish activism===
Hecht claimed that he had never experienced anti-Semitism in his life, and claimed to have had little to do with Judaism, but &quot;was drawn back to the Lower East Side late in life and lived for a while on Henry Street, where he could absorb the energy and social consciousness of the ghetto&quot;, wrote author Sanford Sternlicht. In 1931, he published a novel, &quot;A Jew in Love&quot;, for which he was called, a &quot;self-hating Jew&quot;, and which has been analysed as a product of a generation of Jewish writers seeking to escape their parent&#x27;s immigrant past. 

His indifference to Jewish issues changed when he met Peter Bergson, who was drumming up American assistance for the Zionist group Irgun. Hecht wrote in his book, &quot;Perfidy&quot;, that he used to be a scriptwriter until his meeting with Bergson, when he accidentally bumped into history: that is, the burning need to do anything possible to save the doomed Jews of Europe (paraphrase from &quot;Perfidy&quot;). As Hecht relates it in &quot;A Child of the Century&quot;, he didn&#x27;t feel particularly Jewish in his daily life until Bergson shook him out of his assimilated complacency: Bergson invited Hecht to ask three close friends whether, in their opinion, Hecht was an American or a Jew. All three replied that he was a Jew. (This is incorrect; in his book, &quot;A Child of the Century&quot;, Hecht says that he used that line to convince David Selznick to sponsor a mass meeting at the Hollywood canteen.)

Like many stories Hecht told about his life, that tale may be apocryphal, but after meeting Bergson, Hecht quickly became a member of his inner circle and dedicated himself to some goals of the group, particularly the rescue of Europe&#x27;s Jews.

Hecht &quot;took on a ten-year commitment to publicize the atrocities befalling his own religious minority, the Jews of Europe, and the quest for survivors to find a permanent home in the Middle East&quot;. In 1943, during the midst of the Holocaust, he predicted, in a widely published article in &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; magazine,

Also in 1943, &quot;out of frustration over American policy, and outrage at Hollywood&#x27;s fear of offending its European markets&quot;, he organized and wrote a pageant, &quot;We Will Never Die&quot;, which was produced by Billy Rose and Ernst Lubitsch, with the help of composer Kurt Weill and staging by Moss Hart. The pageant was performed at Madison Square Garden for two shows in front of 40,000 people in March 1943. It then traveled nationwide, including a performance at the Hollywood Bowl. Hecht was disappointed nonetheless. As Weill noted afterward, &quot;The pageant has accomplished nothing. Actually, all we have done is make a lot of Jews cry, which is not a unique accomplishment.&quot;


Following the war, Hecht openly supported the Jewish insurgency in Palestine, a campaign of violence being waged by underground Zionist groups (the Haganah, Irgun, and Lehi) in Palestine. Hecht was a member of the Bergson Group, an Irgun front group in the United States run by Peter Bergson, which was active in raising money for the Irgun&#x27;s activities and disseminating Irgun propaganda.

Hecht wrote the script for the Bergson Group&#x27;s production of &quot;A Flag is Born&quot;, which opened on September 5, 1946, at the Alvin Playhouse in New York City. The play, which compared the Zionist underground&#x27;s campaign in Palestine to the American Revolution, was intended to increase public support for the Zionist cause in the United States. The play starred Marlon Brando and Paul Muni during its various productions. The proceeds from the play were used to purchase a ship that was renamed the MS &quot;Ben Hecht&quot;, which carried 900 Holocaust survivors to Palestine in March 1947. The Royal Navy captured the ship after it docked, and 600 of its passengers were detained as illegal immigrants and sent to the Cyprus internment camps. The SS &quot;Ben Hecht&quot; later became the flagship of the Israeli Navy. The crew was imprisoned by the British authorities in Acre Prison, and assisted in the preparations for the Acre Prison break.

Hecht&#x27;s most controversial action during this period was writing an open letter to the Jewish insurgents in May 1947 which openly praised underground violence against the British. It included the highly controversial passage:

Six months after the establishment of Israel, the Bergson Group was dissolved, followed by a dinner in New York City where former Irgun commander Menachem Begin appeared, saying,

Thanks to his fundraising, speeches, and jawboning, Sternlicht writes,

In October 1948, the Cinematograph Exhibitors&#x27; Association, a trade union representing about 4,700 British film theaters, announced a ban on all films in which Hecht had a role. This was a result of &quot;his intemperate utterances on the Palestine problem&quot;, according to one source. As a result, filmmakers, concerned with jeopardizing the British market, became more reluctant to hire Hecht. Hecht cut his fee in half and wrote screenplays under pseudonyms or completely anonymously to evade the boycott, which was lifted in 1952.

==Notable screenplays==
;&quot;Underworld&quot; (1927)
&quot;Underworld&quot; was the story of a petty hoodlum with political pull; it was based on a real Chicago gangster Hecht knew. &quot;The film began the gangster film genre that became popular in the early 1930s.&quot;. It and &quot;Scarface&quot; were &quot;the alpha and omega of Hollywood&#x27;s first gangster craze&quot;. In it, he &quot;manages both to congratulate journalism for its importance and to chastise it for its chicanery, by underlining the newspapers&#x27; complicity in promoting the underworld image&quot;.
 
Hecht was noted for confronting producers and directors when he wasn&#x27;t satisfied with the way they used his scripts. For this film, at one point he demanded that its director, Josef von Sternberg, remove his name from the credits since Sternberg unilaterally changed one scene. Afterward, however, he relented and took credit for the film&#x27;s story, which went on to win the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay – the first year the awards were presented.

;&quot;The Front Page&quot; (1931)
After contributing to the original stories for a number of films, he worked without credit on the first film version of his original 1928 play &quot;The Front Page&quot;. It was produced by Howard Hughes and directed by Lewis Milestone in 1931. James Harvey writes,

Of the original play, theater producer and writer Jed Harris writes,

;&quot;Scarface&quot; (1932)
After ushering in the beginning of the gangster films with &quot;Underworld&quot;, his next film became one of the best films of that genre. &quot;Scarface&quot; was directed by Howard Hawks, with &quot;Hecht the wordsmith and Hawks the engineer&quot;, who became &quot;one of the few directors with whom Hecht enjoyed working&quot;. It starred Paul Muni playing the role of an Al Capone-like gangster. &quot;&quot;Scarface&#x27;s&quot; all-but-suffocating vitality is a kind of cinematic version of tabloid prose at its best.&quot;

The story of how &quot;Scarface&quot; came to be written represents Hecht&#x27;s writing style in those days. Film historian Max Wilk interviewed Leyland Hayward, an independent literary agent, who, in 1931, managed to convince Hecht that a young oil tycoon in Texas named Howard Hughes wanted him to write the screenplay to his first book. Hayward wrote about that period:

;&quot;Twentieth Century&quot; (1934)
For his next film, &quot;Twentieth Century&quot;, he wrote the screenplay in collaboration with Charles MacArthur as an adaptation of their original play from 1932. It was directed by Howard Hawks, and starred John Barrymore and Carole Lombard. It is a comedy about a Broadway producer who was losing his leading lady to the seductive Hollywood film industry, and will do anything to win her back.

It is &quot;a fast-paced, witty film that contains the rapid-fire dialogue for which Hecht became famous. It is one of the first, and finest, of the screwball comedies of the 1930s.&quot;

;&quot;Viva Villa!&quot; (1934)
This was the story about Mexican rebel, Pancho Villa, who takes to the hills after killing an overseer in revenge for his father&#x27;s death. It was directed by Howard Hawks and starred Wallace Beery. Although the movie took liberties with the facts, it became a great success, and Hecht received an Academy Award nomination for his screenplay adaptation.

In a letter from the film&#x27;s producer, David O. Selznick, to studio head Louis B. Mayer, Selznick discussed the need for a script rewrite:

;&quot;Barbary Coast&quot; (1935)
&quot;Barbary Coast&quot; was also directed by Howard Hawks and starred Miriam Hopkins and Edward G. Robinson. The film takes place in late nineteenth century San Francisco with Hopkins playing the role of a dance-hall girl up against Robinson, who runs the town.

;The Scoundrel (1935)
Hecht and Macarthur left Hollywood and went back to New York where they wrote produced and co-directed &quot;The Scoundrel&quot; marking the American film debut of Noël Coward. Reminiscent of Molnar&#x27;s &quot;Liliom&quot;, the movie won the Academy Award for Best Original Story.

;&quot;Nothing Sacred&quot; (1938)
&quot;Nothing Sacred&quot; became Hecht&#x27;s first project after he and Charles MacArthur closed their failing film company, which they started in 1934. The film was adapted from his play, &quot;Hazel Flagg&quot;, and starred Carole Lombard as a small-town girl diagnosed with radium poisoning. &quot;A reporter makes her case a cause for his newspaper.&quot; The story &quot;allowed Hecht to work with one of his favorite themes, hypocrisy (especially among journalists); he took the themes of lying, decadence, and immorality, and made them into a sophisticated screwball comedy&quot;.

;&quot;Gunga Din&quot; (1939)
&quot;Gunga Din&quot; was co-written with Charles MacArthur, and became &quot;one of Hollywood&#x27;s greatest action-adventure films&quot;. The screenplay was based on the poem by Rudyard Kipling, directed by George Stevens and starred Cary Grant and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. In 1999, the film was deemed &quot;culturally significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress.

;&quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1939)
After working without credit on &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; in 1939, he co-wrote (with Charles MacArthur) an adaptation of Emily Brontë&#x27;s novel, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. Although the screenplay was cut off at the story&#x27;s half-way point, as it was considered too long, it was nominated for an Academy Award.

;&quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful World&quot; (1939)
Movie historian James Harvey notes that in some respects &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful World&quot; is an even more accomplished film – the comedy counterpart to the supremely assured and high-spirited work Van Dyke had accomplished with &quot;San Francisco&quot; (1936). &quot;Ben Hecht, another speed specialist, wrote the screenplay (from a story by Hecht and Herman Mankiewicz); it&#x27;s in his &quot;Front Page&quot; vein, with admixtures of &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; and &quot;Bringing Up Baby&quot;, as well as surprising adumbrations of the nineteen-forties private-eye film.&quot;

;&quot;Angels Over Broadway&quot; (1940)
&quot;Angels Over Broadway&quot; was one of only two movies he directed, produced, and wrote originally for film, the other was &quot;Specter of the Rose&quot; (1946). Angels Over Broadway was considered &quot;one of his most personal works&quot;. It starred Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and Rita Hayworth and was nominated for an Academy Award. &quot;The dialogue as well as the script&#x27;s descriptive passages are chock full of brittle Hechtian similes that sparkle on the page, but turn leaden when delivered. Hecht was an endlessly articulate raconteur. In his novels and memoirs, articulation dominates&quot;.

In the script, he experimented with &quot;reflections of life – as if a ghost were drifting in the rain&quot;. These &quot;reflections&quot; of sidewalks, bridges, glass, and neon make the film a visual prototype of the nineteen-forties &quot;film noir&quot;.

;Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Spellbound&quot; (1945) and &quot;Notorious&quot; (1946)
For Alfred Hitchcock he wrote a number of his best psycho-dramas and received his final Academy Award nomination for &quot;Notorious&quot;. He also worked without credit on Hitchcock&#x27;s next two films, &quot;The Paradine Case&quot; (1947) and &quot;Rope&quot; (1948). &quot;Spellbound&quot;, the first time Hitchcock worked with Hecht, is notable for being one of the first Hollywood movies to deal seriously with the subject of psychoanalysis.

;&quot;Monkey Business&quot; (1952)
In 1947, he teamed up with Charles Lederer, and co-wrote three films: &quot;Her Husband&#x27;s Affairs&quot;, &quot;Kiss of Death&quot;, and &quot;Ride the Pink Horse&quot;. In 1950, he co-wrote &quot;The Thing&quot; without credit. They again teamed up to write the 1952 screwball comedy, &quot;Monkey Business&quot;, which became Hecht&#x27;s last true success as a screenwriter.

===Uncredited films===
Among the better-known films he helped write without being credited are &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, &quot;The Shop Around the Corner&quot;, &quot;&quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot;&quot;, &quot;His Girl Friday&quot; (the second film version of his play &quot;The Front Page&quot;), &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;, &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;, &quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967), and &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;. According to Edward White, Hecht&#x27;s last minute script rewrite for &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (Hecht had never read the novel), likely saved it from box office disaster, lending credence to Hecht&#x27;s nickname as the &quot;Shakespeare of Hollywood&quot;, even though Hecht saw it as an example of how bad Hollywood&#x27;s movies really are.

Often, the only evidence of Hecht&#x27;s involvement in a movie screenplay has come from letters.

The following are snippets of letters discussing &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;, based on the novel by Ernest Hemingway:

:Letter by David O. Selznick to Hecht, December 19, 1956:


:Letter by Selznick to John Huston, April 3, 1957:

The following letter discusses &quot;Portrait of Jennie&quot; (1948):
:Letter by Selznick to Hecht, November 24, 1948:

;&quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939)
For original screenplay writer Sidney Howard, film historian Joanne Yeck writes,

Producer David O. Selznick replaced the film&#x27;s director three weeks into filming and then had the script rewritten. He sought out director Victor Fleming, who, at the time, was directing &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;. Fleming was dissatisfied with the script, so Selznick brought in famed writer Ben Hecht to rewrite the entire screenplay within five days.

Hecht was not credited, however, for his contribution, and Sidney Howard received the Academy Award for Best Screenplay.

In a letter from Selznick to film editor O&#x27;Shea [October 19, 1939], Selznick discussed how the writing credits should appear, taking into consideration that Sidney Howard had died a few months earlier after a farm-tractor accident at his home in Massachusetts:


In a letter [September 25, 1939] from Selznick to Hecht, regarding writing introductory sequences and titles, which were used to set the scene and condense the narrative throughout the movie, Selznick wrote,

;&quot;His Girl Friday&quot; (1940)
&quot;&quot;His Girl Friday&quot; remains not just the fastest-talking romantic comedy ever made, but a very tricky inquiry into love&#x27;s need for a chase (or a dream) and the sharpest pointer to uncertain gender roles.&quot;

The &quot;D.C. Examiner&quot; writes,

;&quot;Casino Royale&quot; (1967)
Hecht wrote the first screenplay for Ian Fleming&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;. Although the final screenplay and film was made into a comedy spoof, Hecht&#x27;s version was written as a straight Bond adventure, states spy novelist Jeremy Duns, who recently discovered the original lost scripts. According to Duns, Hecht&#x27;s version included elements hard to imagine in a film adaptation, adding that &quot;these drafts are a master-class in thriller-writing, from the man who arguably perfected the form with &quot;Notorious&quot;.&quot; Hecht wrote that he has &quot;never had more fun writing a movie&quot;, and felt the James Bond character was cinema&#x27;s first &quot;gentleman superman&quot; in a long time, as opposed to Hammett and Chandler&#x27;s &quot;roughneck supermen&quot;.

A few days before the final screenplay was announced to the press, Hecht died of a heart attack at his home.

Duns compares Hecht&#x27;s unpublished screenplay with the final rewritten film:

===Musical contributions===
* In 1937, lyricist Hecht collaborated with composer Louis Armstrong on &quot;Red Cap&quot;, a song about the hard life of a railway porter. That summer, Louis Armstrong and his Orchestra recorded it for Decca Records, as did Erskine Hawkins&#x27;s Orchestra for Vocalion. This may be Ben Hecht&#x27;s only &quot;popular&quot; song.
* &quot;Uncle Sam Stands Up&quot; (1941) Hecht contributed the lyrics and poetry to this patriotic cantata for baritone solo, chorus, and orchestra composed by Ferde Grofe, written during the height of World War II.
* &quot;We Will Never Die&quot; (1943) a pageant he composed with Kurt Weill, with staging by Moss Hart, written partly because of Hecht&#x27;s consternation with American foreign policy in Europe concerning the Holocaust and Hollywood&#x27;s fear of offending the European (Axis) market

<text>Naxos (; , ) is a Greek island belonging to the Cyclades island group. It is the largest island in the group. It was an important centre during the Bronze Age Cycladic Culture and in the Ancient Greek Archaic Period. The island is famous as a source of emery, a rock rich in corundum, which until modern times was one of the best abrasives available.

The largest town and capital of the island is Chora or Naxos City, with 8,897 inhabitants (2021 census). The main villages are Filoti, Apiranthos, Vivlos, Agios Arsenios, Koronos and Glynado.

== History ==
=== Mythic Naxos ===

According to Greek mythology, the young Zeus was raised in a cave on Mt. Zas (&quot;&quot;Zas&quot; meaning &quot;Zeus&quot;&quot;). Homer mentions &quot;Dia&quot;; literally the sacred island &quot;of the Goddess&quot;. Károly Kerényi explains:

One legend has it that in the Heroic Age before the Trojan War, Theseus abandoned Ariadne on this island after she helped him kill the Minotaur and escape from the Labyrinth. Dionysus (god of wine, festivities, and the primal energy of life) who was the protector of the island, met Ariadne and fell in love with her. But eventually Ariadne, unable to bear her separation from Theseus, either killed herself (according to the Athenians), or ascended to heaven (as the older versions had it). The Naxos portion of the Ariadne myth is also told in the Richard Strauss opera &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot;.

The giant brothers Otus and Ephialtes figure in at least two Naxos myths: in one, Artemis bought the abandonment of a siege they laid against the gods, by offering to live on Naxos as Otus&#x27;s lover; in another, the brothers had actually settled Naxos.

It is also said that the sea god Poseidon was passing by Naxos whilst driving his chariot on the sea surface and is where he first laid eyes on his future wife, the nereid Amphitrite as she was dancing there.
=== Middle Paleolithic era ===
Stelida quarry, south-west of Chora, contains Mousterian tools dating back to the Middle Paleolithic era, which indicates that Neanderthal activity on the island spanned almost 200,000 years ago. The extinct dwarf elephant species &quot;Palaeoloxodon lomolinoi&quot; lived on Naxos at some point during the Late Pleistocene.

=== Cycladic civilisation ===
Zas Cave, inhabited during the Neolithic era, contained objects of stone from Melos and copper objects including a dagger and gold sheet. The presence of gold and other objects within the cave indicated to researchers the status of the inhabitant.

Emery was exported to other islands during that time.

=== Classical era and Greco-Persian Wars ===
During the 8th and 7th centuries BC, Naxos dominated commerce in the Cyclades. 

Herodotus describes Naxos circa 500 BC as the most prosperous Greek island.

In 499 BC, an unsuccessful attack on Naxos by Persian forces led several prominent men in the Greek cities of Ionia to rebel against the Persian Empire in the Ionian Revolt, and then to the Persian War between Greece and Persia.

Naxos was the first Greek city-state to attempt to leave the Delian League circa 469 BC; Athens quickly quashed the notion and forcibly removed all military naval vessels from the island&#x27;s control. Athens then demanded all future payments from Naxos in the form of gold rather than military aid.

=== Byzantine era ===

In Late Antiquity, the island was part of the province of the Islands.

Pope Martin I was detained on the island of Naxos for almost a year after he was arrested by Byzantine authorities in Rome due to his holding of a synod that condemned monotheletism. He was held on the island prior to being taken to Constantinople for trial. While detained on the island, he wrote to a certain Theodore living in Constantinople. 

Under the Byzantine Empire, Naxos was part of the thema of the Aegean Sea, which was established in the mid-9th century.

In Byzantine times, the island&#x27;s capital was on the southern fortress of Apalyres. During this time, it suffered from Saracen raids, particular during the existence of the Emirate of Crete (824–961), to which the island occasionally paid tribute. Traces of Muslim artistic influence are visible in frescoes from the 10th century. Nevertheless, as in Antiquity, Naxos was celebrated for its agriculture and animal husbandry; the 12th-century geographer al-Idrisi records extensive cattle raising on the island.

In the late 12th century, it may have been the capital of a short-lived thema of the &quot;Dodekanesos&quot;.

=== Duchy of Naxos ===

In the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, with a Latin Empire under the influence of the Venetians established at Constantinople, the Venetian Marco Sanudo conquered Naxos and most of the other Cyclades in 1205–1207. Of all the islands, only on Naxos was there any opposition to Sanudo: a group of Genoese pirates had occupied the castle between the end of Byzantine rule and Sanudo&#x27;s arrival. To steel his band&#x27;s resolve, Sanudo burnt his galleys &quot;and bade his companions to conquer or die&quot;. The pirates surrendered the castle after a five weeks&#x27; siege.

Naxos became the seat of Sanudo&#x27;s realm, known as the &quot;Duchy of Naxos&quot; or &quot;Duchy of the Archipelago&quot;. Twenty-one dukes in two dynasties ruled the Archipelago, until 1566; Venetian rule continued in scattered islands of the Aegean until 1714. Under Venetian rule, the island was called by its Italian name, &quot;Nasso&quot;.

The Sanudi introduced Western feudal law to the island, based on the &quot;Assizes of Romania&quot;. However, the native Greek population continued to use Byzantine law for civil matters at least until the late 16th century.

In the 13th century, following the capture of Antalya and Alanya on the southern Anatolian coast by the Seljuk Turks, refugees from these areas settled in Naxos. In the 14th century, the island was once more exposed to raids, this time from the Anatolian Turkish beyliks, chiefly the Aydınids. In turn, the Sanudi assisted the Genoese in capturing Chios in 1304 and the Knights Hospitaller in their conquest of Rhodes in 1309, in order to stop these islands being used as Turkish pirate base. Nevertheless, raids against Naxos are recorded in 1324 and 1326, and in 1341, Umur of Aydın carried off 6,000 people from the island and imposed a payment of tribute. Two years later, however, the Smyrniote crusade captured his main port, Smyrna. 
The relief was temporary, however, as Turkish raids recommenced later in the century. The island was so depopulated that Cristoforo Buondelmonti in claimed that there were not enough men to wed the Naxiot women. The rising Ottoman Empire first attacked the island in 1416, but the Sultans recognized Venetian overlordship over the Duchy in successive treaties, in exchange for an annual tribute.

=== Ottoman era (1566–1821) ===
The Ottoman administration remained essentially in the hands of the Venetians; the Porte&#x27;s concern was satisfied by the returns of taxes. Very few Turks ever settled on Naxos, and Turkish influence on the island was insignificant. Under Ottoman rule the island was known in Turkish as . Ottoman sovereignty lasted until 1821, when the islands revolted; Naxos finally became part of the Greek state in 1832.

== Early commentators ==
Early commentators in English on the island include: 

Bernard Randolph, in &quot;The Present State of the Islands in the Archipelago&quot; (1687, Oxford, pp. 20-21).

Jean de Thévenot, in &quot;Travels into the Levant&quot; (1687, London, pp. 103–105).

Joseph Pitton de Tournefort, in &quot;A Voyage Into the Levant&quot; (1718, London, pp. 161–176).

Thomas Bankes et al., in &quot;A new royal authentic and complete system of universal geography antient and modern...&quot; (1787, London, p. 943).

Edward Daniel Clarke, in &quot;Travels in Various Countries&quot; (1814, vol. 3, section 2, London, pp. 377–400).

William Martin Leake, in &quot;Travels in Northern Greece&quot; (1835, vol. 3, London, pp. 93-95).

Theodore Bent, in &quot;The Cyclades, or Life Among the Insular Greeks&quot; (1885, London, pp. 329–371).

== Geography ==
=== Climate ===
Naxos experiences both a Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) and a hot semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;BSh&quot;) depending on the location. According to the stations of the National Observatory of Athens, various locations in Naxos have a hot semi-arid climate. 
 Inland areas of the island are much wetter and cooler in winter, owing to their higher elevation.

==Economy==
===Historical population===

=== Tourism ===
Naxos is a popular tourist destination, with several places of touristic interest, including beaches, villages and old ruins. Beaches on the island include Agia Anna, Agios Prokopios, Aliko, Kastraki, Mikri Vigla, Plaka, and Agios Georgios, most of them on the western side of the island, near Chora.
As other cycladic islands, Naxos is considered a windy place perfect for windsurfing, as well as kitesurfing. There are seven sports clubs in the island that offer both of these sports and other water activities.
=== Agriculture ===
Naxos is the most fertile island of the Cyclades. It has a good supply of water in a region where water is usually inadequate. Mount Zeus () is the highest peak in the Cyclades, and tends to trap the clouds, permitting greater rainfall. This has made agriculture an important economic sector with various vegetable and fruit crops as well as cattle breeding, making Naxos the most self-sufficient island in the Cyclades. Naxos is well known within Greece for its &quot;Arseniko Naxou&quot; cheese, potatoes, Kitron (a local lemon-citrus spirit), and Naxian honey (which is largely derived from the nectar of thyme).

===Marble===
The quarrying of marble on Naxos began before 550 BCE. Naxian marble was used for the creation of the roof tiles at ancient Olympia and on the Athenian Acropolis, As of 2016, about 5,000 m³ of high value Naxian marble was being exported annually.

<doc id="62283" wikidata="Q7530055" url="?curid=62283" title="Sircam">
<text>Sircam is a computer worm that first propagated in 2001 by e-mail in Microsoft Windows systems. It affected computers running Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows Me (Millennium). It began with one of the following lines of text and had an attachment consisting of the worm&#x27;s executable with some file from the infected computer appended:

*I send you this file in order to have your advice
*I hope you like the file that I sent you

*I hope you can help me with this file that I send
*This is the file with the information you ask for
*Te mando este archivo para que me des tu punto de vista 
*Espero te guste este archivo que te mando
*Espero me puedas ayudar con el archivo que te mando
*Este es el archivo con la informacion que me pediste

Due to an error in the worm, the message was rarely sent in any form other than &quot;I send you this file in order to have your advice.&quot; This subsequently became an in-joke among those who were using the Internet at the time, and were spammed with e-mails containing this string sent by the worm.

Sircam was notable during its outbreak for the way it distributed itself. Document files (usually .doc or .xls) on the infected computer were chosen at random, infected with the virus and emailed out to email addresses in the host&#x27;s address book. Opening the infected file resulted in infection of the target computer. During the outbreak, many personal or private files were emailed to people who otherwise should not have received them.

It could also spread via open shares on a network. Sircam scanned the network for computers with shared drives and copied itself to a machine with an open (non-password protected) drive or directory. A simple RPC (Remote Procedure Call) was then executed to start the process on the target machine, usually unknown to the owner of the now-compromised computer.

Over a year after the initial 2001 outbreak, Sircam was still in the top 10 on virus charts.

<text>Eutardigrada are a class of tardigrades (Tardigrada) without lateral appendages. Primarily freshwater bound, some species have secondarily gained the ability to live in marine environments (&quot;Halobiotus&quot;). By cryptobiosis many species are able to live temporarily in very dry environments. More than 700 species have been described.

The order Apochela consists of only one family, Milnesiidae, with two genera: &quot;Milnesium&quot; and &quot;Limmenius&quot;. &quot;Milnesium tardigradum&quot; can be found worldwide and is one of the biggest species among tardigrades (up to 1.4 mm); similar-looking species have been found in Cretaceous amber. The mouth of this predator has a wide opening, so the animal can eat rotifers and larger protists. Other eutardigrades belong to the order Parachela.

<text>In Egyptian hieroglyphs, a cartouche ( ) is an oval with a line at one end tangent to it, indicating that the text enclosed is a royal name. The first examples of the cartouche are associated with pharaohs at the end of the Third Dynasty, but the feature did not come into common use until the beginning of the Fourth Dynasty under Pharaoh Sneferu. While the cartouche is usually vertical with a horizontal line, if it makes the name fit better it can be horizontal, with a vertical line at the end (in the direction of reading). The ancient Egyptian word for cartouche was (compare with Coptic &quot;šne&quot; yielding eventual sound changes), and the cartouche was essentially an expanded shen ring. Demotic script reduced the cartouche to a pair of brackets and a vertical line.
Of the five royal titularies it was the &quot;prenomen&quot; (the throne name), and the &quot;Son of Ra&quot; titulary (the so-called &quot;nomen&quot; name given at birth), which were enclosed by a cartouche.

At times amulets took the form of a cartouche displaying the name of a king and placed in tombs. Archaeologists often find such items important for dating a tomb and its contents. Cartouches were formerly only worn by pharaohs. The oval surrounding their name was meant to protect them from evil spirits in life and after death. The cartouche has become a symbol representing good luck and protection from evil.

The term &quot;cartouche&quot; was first applied by French soldiers who fancied that the symbol they saw so frequently repeated on the pharaonic ruins they encountered resembled a muzzle-loading firearm&#x27;s paper powder cartridge ( in French).
As a hieroglyph, a cartouche can represent the Egyptian-language word for &quot;name&quot;. It is listed as no. V10 in Gardiner&#x27;s Sign List.
The cartouche in half-section, Gardiner no. V11 (as seen below) has a separate meaning in the Egyptian language as a determinative for actions and nouns dealing with items: &quot;to divide&quot;, &quot;to exclude&quot;. V11
The cartouche hieroglyph is used as a determinative for Egyptian language &quot;šn&quot;-(sh)n, for &quot;circuit&quot;, or &quot;ring&quot;-(like the shen ring or the cartouche). Later it was used for &quot;rn&quot;, the word &quot;name&quot;. The word can also be spelled as &quot;r&quot; with &quot;n&quot;, the mouth over the horizontal n. V10 D21:N35

<doc id="62289" wikidata="Q179678" url="?curid=62289" title="Monosodium glutamate">
<text>Monosodium glutamate (MSG), also known as sodium glutamate, is a sodium salt of glutamic acid. MSG is found naturally in some foods including tomatoes and cheese in this glutamic acid form. MSG is used in cooking as a flavor enhancer with a savory taste that intensifies the umami flavor of food, as naturally occurring glutamate does in foods such as stews and meat soups.

MSG was first prepared in 1908 by Japanese biochemist Kikunae Ikeda, who tried to isolate and duplicate the savory taste of &quot;kombu&quot;, an edible seaweed used as a broth (&quot;dashi&quot;) for Japanese cuisine. MSG balances, blends, and rounds the perception of other tastes. MSG, along with disodium ribonucleotides, is commonly used and found in stock (bouillon) cubes, soups, ramen, gravy, stews, condiments, savory snacks, etc.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has given MSG its generally recognized as safe (GRAS) designation. It is a popular misconception that MSG can cause headaches and other feelings of discomfort, known as &quot;Chinese restaurant syndrome&quot;. Several blinded studies show no such effects when MSG is combined with food in normal concentrations, and are inconclusive when MSG is added to broth in large concentrations. The European Union classifies it as a food additive permitted in certain foods and subject to quantitative limits. MSG has the HS code 2922.42 and the E number E621.
==Use==
Pure MSG is reported not to have a highly pleasant taste until it is combined with a savory aroma. The basic sensory function of MSG is attributed to its ability to enhance savory taste-active compounds when added in the proper concentration. The optimal concentration varies by food; in clear soup, the &quot;pleasure score&quot; rapidly falls with the addition of more than one gram of MSG per 100mL.

The sodium content (in mass percent) of MSG, 12.28%, is about one-third of that in sodium chloride (39.34%), due to the greater mass of the glutamate counterion. Although other salts of glutamate have been used in low-salt soups, they are less palatable than MSG. Food scientist Steve Witherly noted in 2017 that MSG may promote healthy eating by enhancing the flavor of food such as kale while reducing the use of salt.

The ribonucleotide food additives disodium inosinate (E631) and disodium guanylate (E627), as well as conventional salt, are usually used with monosodium glutamate-containing ingredients as they seem to have a synergistic effect. &quot;Super salt&quot; is a mixture of 9 parts salt, to one part MSG and 0.1 parts disodium ribonucleotides (a mixture of disodium inosinate and disodium guanylate).

==Safety==
MSG is generally recognized as safe to eat. A popular belief is that MSG can cause headaches and other feelings of discomfort, but blinded tests have not provided strong evidence of this. International bodies governing food additives currently consider MSG safe for human consumption as a flavor enhancer. Under normal conditions, humans can metabolize relatively large quantities of glutamate, which is naturally produced in the gut in the course of protein hydrolysis. The median lethal dose (LD50) is between 15 and 18 g/kg body weight in rats and mice, respectively, five times the LD50 of table salt (3 g/kg in rats). The use of MSG as a food additive and the natural levels of glutamic acid in foods are not of toxic concern in humans. Specifically MSG in the diet does not increase glutamate in the brain or affect brain function.

A 1995 report from the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB) for the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) concluded that MSG is safe when &quot;eaten at customary levels&quot; and, although a subgroup of otherwise-healthy individuals develop an MSG symptom complex when exposed to 3 g of MSG in the absence of food, MSG as a cause has not been established because the symptom reports are anecdotal.

According to the report, no data supports the role of glutamate in chronic disease. High quality evidence has failed to demonstrate a relationship between the MSG symptom complex and actual MSG consumption. No association has been demonstrated, and the few responses were inconsistent. No symptoms were observed when MSG was used in food.

Adequately controlling for experimental bias includes a blinded, placebo-controlled experimental design and administration by capsule, because of the unique aftertaste of glutamates. In a 1993 study, 71 fasting participants were given 5 g of MSG and then a standard breakfast. One reaction (to the placebo, in a self-identified MSG-sensitive individual) occurred. A study in 2000 tested the reaction of 130 subjects with a reported sensitivity to MSG. Multiple trials were performed, with subjects exhibiting at least two symptoms continuing. Two people out of the 130 responded to all four challenges. Because of the low prevalence, the researchers concluded that a response to MSG was not reproducible.

Studies exploring MSG&#x27;s role in obesity have yielded mixed results.

Although several studies have investigated anecdotal links between MSG and asthma, current evidence does not support a causal association.

Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) MSG technical report concludes, &quot;There is no convincing evidence that MSG is a significant factor in causing systemic reactions resulting in severe illness or mortality. The studies conducted to date on Chinese restaurant syndrome (CRS) have largely failed to demonstrate a causal association with MSG. Symptoms resembling those of CRS may be provoked in a clinical setting in small numbers of individuals by the administration of large doses of MSG without food. However, such effects are neither persistent nor serious and are likely to be attenuated when MSG is consumed with food. In terms of more serious adverse effects such as the triggering of bronchospasm in asthmatic individuals, the evidence does not indicate that MSG is a significant trigger factor.&quot;

However, the FSANZ MSG report says that although no data is available on average MSG consumption in Australia and New Zealand, &quot;data from the United Kingdom indicates an average intake of 590mg/day, with extreme users (97.5th percentile consumers) consuming 2,330mg/day&quot; (Rhodes et al. 1991). In a highly seasoned restaurant meal, intakes as high as 5,000 mg or more may be possible (Yang et al. 1997). When very large doses of MSG (&gt;5 g MSG in a bolus dose) are ingested, plasma glutamate concentration will significantly increase. However, the concentration typically returns to normal within two hours. In general, foods providing metabolizable carbohydrates significantly attenuate peak plasma glutamate levels at doses up to 150mg/kg body weight. Two earlier studiesthe 1987 Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) and the 1995 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology (FASEB)concluded, &quot;there may be a small number of unstable asthmatics who respond to doses of 1.5–2.5 g of MSG in the absence of food&quot;. The FASEB evaluation concluded, &quot;sufficient evidence exists to indicate some individuals may experience manifestations of CRS when exposed to a ≥3 g bolus dose of MSG in the absence of food&quot;.

==Production==
MSG has been produced by three methods: hydrolysis of vegetable proteins with hydrochloric acid to disrupt peptide bonds (1909–1962); direct chemical synthesis with acrylonitrile (1962–1973), and bacterial fermentation (the current method). Wheat gluten was originally used for hydrolysis because it contains more than 30 g of glutamate and glutamine per 100 g of protein. As demand for MSG increased, chemical synthesis and fermentation were studied. The polyacrylic fiber industry began in Japan during the mid-1950s, and acrylonitrile was adopted as a base material to synthesize MSG.

As of 2016, most MSG worldwide is produced by bacterial fermentation in a process similar to making vinegar or yogurt. Sodium is added later, for neutralization. During fermentation, &quot;Corynebacterium&quot; species, cultured with ammonia and carbohydrates from sugar beets, sugarcane, tapioca or molasses, excrete amino acids into a culture broth from which L-glutamate is isolated. Kyowa Hakko Kogyo (currently Kyowa Kirin) developed industrial fermentation to produce L-glutamate.

The conversion yield and production rate (from sugars to glutamate) continues to improve in the industrial production of MSG, keeping up with demand. The product, after filtration, concentration, acidification, and crystallization, is glutamate, sodium ions, and water.

==Chemical properties==
The compound is usually available as the monohydrate, a white, odorless, crystalline powder. The solid contains separate sodium cations and glutamate anions in zwitterionic form, −OOC-CH()-()2-COO−. In solution it dissociates into glutamate and sodium ions.

MSG is freely soluble in water, but it is not hygroscopic and is insoluble in common organic solvents (such as ether). It is generally stable under food-processing conditions. MSG does not break down during cooking and, like other amino acids, will exhibit a Maillard reaction (browning) in the presence of sugars at very high temperatures.

==History==
Glutamic acid was discovered and identified in 1866 by the German chemist Karl Heinrich Ritthausen, who treated wheat gluten (for which it was named) with sulfuric acid. Kikunae Ikeda of Tokyo Imperial University isolated glutamic acid as a taste substance in 1908 from the seaweed &quot;Laminaria japonica&quot; (&quot;kombu&quot;) by aqueous extraction and crystallization, calling its taste &quot;umami&quot; (&quot;delicious taste&quot;). Ikeda noticed that &quot;dashi&quot;, the Japanese broth of &quot;katsuobushi&quot; and &quot;kombu&quot;, had a unique taste not yet scientifically described (not sweet, salty, sour, or bitter). To determine which glutamate could result in the taste of &quot;umami&quot;, he studied the taste properties of numerous glutamate salts such as calcium, potassium, ammonium, and magnesium glutamate. Of these salts, monosodium glutamate was the most soluble and palatable, as well as the easiest to crystallize. Ikeda called his product &quot;monosodium glutamate&quot; and submitted a patent to produce MSG; the Suzuki brothers began commercial production of MSG in 1909 using the term Ajinomoto (&quot;essence of taste&quot;).

==Society and culture==

===Regulations===
====United States====
MSG is one of several forms of glutamic acid found in foods, in large part because glutamic acid (an amino acid) is pervasive in nature. Glutamic acid and its salts may be present in a variety of other additives, including hydrolyzed vegetable protein, autolyzed yeast, hydrolyzed yeast, yeast extract, soy extracts, and protein isolate, which must be specifically labeled. Since 1998, MSG cannot be included in the term &quot;spices and flavorings&quot;. However, the term &quot;&quot;natural flavor/s&quot; is used by the food industry for glutamic acid (chemically similar to MSG, lacking only the sodium ion). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) does not require disclosure of components and amounts of &quot;natural flavor/s&quot;.&quot;

====Australia and New Zealand====
Standard 1.2.4 of the Australia and New Zealand Food Standards Code requires MSG to be labeled in packaged foods. The label must have the food-additive class name (e.g. &quot;flavour enhancer&quot;), followed by the name of the additive (&quot;MSG&quot;) or its International Numbering System (INS) number, 621.

====Pakistan====
The Punjab Food Authority banned Ajinomoto, commonly known as Chinese salt, which contains MSG, from being used in food products in the Punjab Province of Pakistan in January 2018. 

The prohibition against the import and manufacture of MSG was enforced on 28 February 2018, following an order by the Supreme Court on 10 February 2018.

In 2024, the federal government lifted the ban on MSG, following objections from Japan and a review of scientific evidence by an expert committee. The committee comprising experts from various institutions—including the Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, National Agricultural Research Centre, and Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority—confirmed MSG as a safe food additive.

===Stigma in cuisine===
====Origin====
The controversy surrounding the safety of MSG started with the publication of Robert Ho Man Kwok&#x27;s correspondence letter titled &quot;Chinese-Restaurant Syndrome&quot; in the &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; on 4 April 1968. In his letter, Kwok suggested several possible causes before he nominated MSG for his symptoms. This letter was initially met with insider satirical responses, often using race as prop for humorous effect, within the medical community. During the discursive uptake in media, the conversations were recontextualized as legitimate while the race-based motivations of the humor were not parsed, which replicated historical racial prejudices.

Despite the resulting public backlash, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did not remove MSG from their Generally Recognized as Safe list. In 1970, a National Research Council under the National Academy of Science, on behalf of the FDA, investigated MSG but concluded that MSG was safe for consumption.

====Reactions====
The controversy about MSG is tied to racial stereotypes against East Asian societies. Herein, specifically East Asian cuisine was targeted, whereas the widespread usage of MSG in Western processed food does not generate the same stigma. These kind of perceptions, such as the rhetoric of the so-called Chinese restaurant syndrome, have been attributed to xenophobic or racist biases.

Food historian Ian Mosby wrote that fear of MSG in Chinese food is part of the US&#x27;s long history of viewing the &quot;exotic&quot; cuisine of Asia as dangerous and dirty. In 2016, Anthony Bourdain stated in &quot;Parts Unknown&quot; that &quot;I think MSG is good stuff ... You know what causes Chinese restaurant syndrome? Racism.&quot;

In 2020, Ajinomoto, the leading manufacturer of MSG, and others launched the #RedefineCRS campaign, in reference to the term &quot;Chinese restaurant syndrome&quot;, to combat the misconceptions about MSG, saying they intended to highlight the xenophobic prejudice against East Asian cuisine and the scientific evidence. Following the campaign, Merriam-Webster announced it would review the term.

<text>The Dinoflagellates (), also called Dinophytes, are a monophyletic group of single-celled eukaryotes constituting the phylum Dinoflagellata and are usually considered protists. Dinoflagellates are mostly marine plankton, but they are also common in freshwater habitats. Their populations vary with sea surface temperature, salinity, and depth. Many dinoflagellates are photosynthetic, but a large fraction of these are in fact mixotrophic, combining photosynthesis with ingestion of prey (phagotrophy and myzocytosis).

In terms of number of species, dinoflagellates are one of the largest groups of marine eukaryotes, although substantially smaller than diatoms. Some species are endosymbionts of marine animals and play an important part in the biology of coral reefs. Other dinoflagellates are unpigmented predators on other protozoa, and a few forms are parasitic (for example, &quot;Oodinium&quot; and &quot;Pfiesteria&quot;). Some dinoflagellates produce resting stages, called dinoflagellate cysts or dinocysts, as part of their lifecycles; this occurs in 84 of the 350 described freshwater species and a little more than 10% of the known marine species. Dinoflagellates are alveolates possessing two flagella, the ancestral condition of bikonts.

About 1,555 species of free-living marine dinoflagellates are currently described. Another estimate suggests about 2,000 living species, of which more than 1,700 are marine (free-living, as well as benthic) and about 220 are from fresh water. The latest estimates suggest a total of 2,294 living dinoflagellate species, which includes marine, freshwater, and parasitic dinoflagellates.

A rapid accumulation of certain dinoflagellates can result in a visible coloration of the water, colloquially known as red tide (a harmful algal bloom), which can cause shellfish poisoning if humans eat contaminated shellfish. Some dinoflagellates also exhibit bioluminescence, primarily emitting blue-green light, which may be visible in oceanic areas under certain conditions.

==Etymology==

The term &quot;dinoflagellate&quot; is a combination of the Greek &quot;dinos&quot; and the Latin &quot;flagellum&quot;. &quot;Dinos&quot; means &quot;whirling&quot; and signifies the distinctive way in which dinoflagellates were observed to swim. &quot;Flagellum&quot; means &quot;whip&quot; and this refers to their flagella.

==History==

In 1753, the first modern dinoflagellates were described by Henry Baker as &quot;Animalcules which cause the Sparkling Light in Sea Water&quot;, and named by Otto Friedrich Müller in 1773. The term derives from the Greek word δῖνος (&quot;dînos&quot;), meaning whirling, and Latin &quot;flagellum&quot;, a diminutive term for a whip or scourge.

In the 1830s, the German microscopist Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg examined many water and plankton samples and proposed several dinoflagellate genera that are still used today including &quot;Peridinium, Prorocentrum&quot;, and &quot;Dinophysis&quot;.

These same dinoflagellates were first defined by Otto Bütschli in 1885 as the flagellate order Dinoflagellida. Botanists treated them as a division of algae, named Pyrrophyta or Pyrrhophyta (&quot;fire algae&quot;; Greek &quot;pyrr(h)os&quot;, fire) after the bioluminescent forms, or Dinophyta. At various times, the cryptomonads, ebriids, and ellobiopsids have been included here, but only the last are now considered close relatives. Dinoflagellates have a known ability to transform from noncyst to cyst-forming strategies, which makes recreating their evolutionary history extremely difficult.

==Morphology==
Dinoflagellates are unicellular and possess two dissimilar flagella arising from the ventral cell side (dinokont flagellation). They have a ribbon-like transverse flagellum with multiple waves that beats to the cell&#x27;s left, and a more conventional one, the longitudinal flagellum, that beats posteriorly. The transverse flagellum is a wavy ribbon in which only the outer edge undulates from base to tip, due to the action of the axoneme which runs along it. The axonemal edge has simple hairs that can be of varying lengths. The flagellar movement produces forward propulsion and also a turning force. The longitudinal flagellum is relatively conventional in appearance, with few or no hairs. It beats with only one or two periods to its wave. The flagella lie in surface grooves: the transverse one in the cingulum and the longitudinal one in the sulcus, although its distal portion projects freely behind the cell. In dinoflagellate species with desmokont flagellation (e.g., &quot;Prorocentrum&quot;), the two flagella are differentiated as in dinokonts, but they are not associated with grooves.

Dinoflagellates have a complex cell covering called an amphiesma or cortex, composed of a series of membranes, flattened vesicles called alveoli (= amphiesmal vesicles) and related structures. In thecate (&quot;armoured&quot;) dinoflagellates, these support overlapping cellulose plates to create a sort of armor called the theca or lorica, as opposed to athecate (&quot;nude&quot;) dinoflagellates. These occur in various shapes and arrangements, depending on the species and sometimes on the stage of the dinoflagellate. Conventionally, the term tabulation has been used to refer to this arrangement of thecal plates. The plate configuration can be denoted with the plate formula or tabulation formula. Fibrous extrusomes are also found in many forms.

A transverse groove, the so-called cingulum (or cigulum) runs around the cell, thus dividing it into an anterior (episoma) and posterior (hyposoma). If and only if a theca is present, the parts are called epitheca and hypotheca, respectively. Posteriorly, starting from the transverse groove, there is a longitudinal furrow called the sulcus. The transverse flagellum strikes in the cingulum, the longitudinal flagellum in the sulcus.

Together with various other structural and genetic details, this organization indicates a close relationship between the dinoflagellates, the Apicomplexa, and ciliates, collectively referred to as the alveolates.

Dinoflagellate tabulations can be grouped into six &quot;tabulation types&quot;: gymnodinoid, suessoid, gonyaulacoid–peridinioid, nannoceratopsioid, dinophysioid, and prorocentroid.

Most Dinoflagellates have a plastid derived from secondary endosymbiosis of red algae, however dinoflagellates with plastids derived from green algae and tertiary endosymbiosis of diatoms have also been discovered. Similar to other photosynthetic organisms, dinoflagellates contain chlorophylls &quot;a&quot; and c2 and the carotenoid beta-carotene. Dinoflagellates also produce the xanthophylls including peridinin, dinoxanthin, and diadinoxanthin. These pigments give many dinoflagellates their typical golden brown color. However, the dinoflagellates &quot;Karenia brevis, Karenia mikimotoi,&quot; and &quot;Karlodinium micrum&quot; have acquired other pigments through endosymbiosis, including fucoxanthin. 
This suggests their chloroplasts were incorporated by several endosymbiotic events involving already colored or secondarily colorless forms. The discovery of plastids in the Apicomplexa has led some to suggest they were inherited from an ancestor common to the two groups, but none of the more basal lines has them. 
All the same, the dinoflagellate cell consists of the more common organelles such as rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, lipid and starch grains, and food vacuoles. Some have even been found with a light-sensitive organelle, the eyespot or stigma, or a larger nucleus containing a prominent nucleolus. The dinoflagellate &quot;Erythropsidinium&quot; has the smallest known eye.

Some athecate species have an internal skeleton consisting of two star-like siliceous elements that has an unknown function, and can be found as microfossils. Tappan gave a survey of dinoflagellates with internal skeletons. This included the first detailed description of the pentasters in &quot;Actiniscus pentasterias&quot;, based on scanning electron microscopy. They are placed within the order Gymnodiniales, suborder Actiniscineae.

===Theca structure and formation===
The formation of thecal plates has been studied in detail through ultrastructural studies.

===The dinoflagellate nucleus: dinokaryon===

&#x27;Core dinoflagellates&#x27; (dinokaryotes) have a peculiar form of nucleus, called a dinokaryon, in which the chromosomes are attached to the nuclear membrane. These carry reduced number of histones. In place of histones, dinoflagellate nuclei contain a novel, dominant family of nuclear proteins that appear to be of viral origin, thus are called Dinoflagellate viral nucleoproteins (DVNPs) which are highly basic, bind DNA with similar affinity to histones, and occur in multiple posttranslationally modified forms. Dinoflagellate nuclei remain condensed throughout interphase rather than just during mitosis, which is closed and involves a uniquely extranuclear mitotic spindle. This sort of nucleus was once considered to be an intermediate between the nucleoid region of prokaryotes and the true nuclei of eukaryotes, so were termed &quot;mesokaryotic&quot;, but now are considered derived rather than primitive traits (i. e. ancestors of dinoflagellates had typical eukaryotic nuclei). In addition to dinokaryotes, DVNPs can be found in a group of basal dinoflagellates (known as Marine Alveolates, &quot;MALVs&quot;) that branch as sister to dinokaryotes (Syndiniales).

==Classification==
===Generality===

Dinoflagellates are protists and have been classified using both the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN, now renamed as ICN) and the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN). About half of living dinoflagellate species are autotrophs possessing chloroplasts and half are nonphotosynthesising heterotrophs.

The peridinin dinoflagellates, named after their peridinin plastids, appear to be ancestral for the dinoflagellate lineage. Almost half of all known species have chloroplasts, which are either the original peridinin plastids or new plastids acquired from other lineages of unicellular algae through endosymbiosis. The remaining species have lost their photosynthetic abilities and have adapted to a heterotrophic, parasitic or kleptoplastic lifestyle.

Most (but not all) dinoflagellates have a dinokaryon, described below (see: Life cycle, below). Dinoflagellates with a dinokaryon are classified under Dinokaryota, while dinoflagellates without a dinokaryon are classified under Syndiniales.

Although classified as eukaryotes, the dinoflagellate nuclei are not characteristically eukaryotic, as some of them lack histones and nucleosomes, and maintain continually condensed chromosomes during mitosis. The dinoflagellate nucleus was termed &#x27;mesokaryotic&#x27; by Dodge (1966), due to its possession of intermediate characteristics between the coiled DNA areas of prokaryotic bacteria and the well-defined eukaryotic nucleus. This group, however, does contain typically eukaryotic organelles, such as Golgi bodies, mitochondria, and chloroplasts.

Jakob Schiller (1931–1937) provided a description of all the species, both marine and freshwater, known at that time. Later, Alain Sournia (1973, 1978, 1982, 1990, 1993) listed the new taxonomic entries published after Schiller (1931–1937). Sournia (1986) gave descriptions and illustrations of the marine genera of dinoflagellates, excluding information at the species level. The latest index is written by Gómez.

===Identification===
English-language taxonomic monographs covering large numbers of species are published for the Gulf of Mexico, the Indian Ocean, the British Isles, the Mediterranean and the North Sea.

The main source for identification of freshwater dinoflagellates is the &quot;Süsswasser Flora&quot;.

Calcofluor-white can be used to stain thecal plates in armoured dinoflagellates.

==Ecology and physiology==
===Habitats===
Dinoflagellates are found in all aquatic environments: marine, brackish, and fresh water, including in snow or ice. They are also common in benthic environments and sea ice.

===Endosymbionts===
All Zooxanthellae are dinoflagellates and most of them are members within Symbiodiniaceae (e.g. the genus &quot;Symbiodinium&quot;). The association between &quot;Symbiodinium&quot; and reef-building corals is widely known. However, endosymbiontic Zooxanthellae inhabit a great number of other invertebrates and protists, for example many sea anemones, jellyfish, nudibranchs, the giant clam &quot;Tridacna&quot;, and several species of radiolarians and foraminiferans. Many extant dinoflagellates are parasites (here defined as organisms that eat their prey from the inside, i.e. endoparasites, or that remain attached to their prey for longer periods of time, i.e. ectoparasites). They can parasitize animal or protist hosts. &quot;Protoodinium, Crepidoodinium, Piscinoodinium&quot;, and &quot;Blastodinium&quot; retain their plastids while feeding on their zooplanktonic or fish hosts. In most parasitic dinoflagellates, the infective stage resembles a typical motile dinoflagellate cell.

===Nutritional strategies===
Three nutritional strategies are seen in dinoflagellates: phototrophy, mixotrophy, and heterotrophy. Phototrophs can be photoautotrophs or auxotrophs. Mixotrophic dinoflagellates are photosynthetically active, but are also heterotrophic. Facultative mixotrophs, in which autotrophy or heterotrophy is sufficient for nutrition, are classified as amphitrophic. If both forms are required, the organisms are mixotrophic &quot;sensu stricto&quot;. Some free-living dinoflagellates do not have chloroplasts, but host a phototrophic endosymbiont. A few dinoflagellates may use alien chloroplasts (cleptochloroplasts), obtained from food (kleptoplasty). Some dinoflagellates may feed on other organisms as predators or parasites.

Food inclusions contain bacteria, bluegreen algae, diatoms, ciliates, and other dinoflagellates.

Mechanisms of capture and ingestion in dinoflagellates are quite diverse. Several dinoflagellates, both thecate (e.g. &quot;Ceratium hirundinella&quot;, &quot;Peridinium globulus&quot;) and nonthecate (e.g. &quot;Oxyrrhis marina&quot;, &quot;Gymnodinium&quot; sp. and &quot;Kofoidinium&quot; spp.), draw prey to the sulcal region of the cell (either via water currents set up by the flagella or via pseudopodial extensions) and ingest the prey through the sulcus. In several &quot;Protoperidinium&quot; spp., e.g. &quot;P. conicum&quot;, a large feeding veil—a pseudopod called the pallium—is extruded to capture prey which is subsequently digested extracellularly (= pallium-feeding). &quot;Oblea&quot;, &quot;Zygabikodinium&quot;, and &quot;Diplopsalis&quot; are the only other dinoflagellate genera known to use this particular feeding mechanism.
&quot;Gymnodinium fungiforme&quot;, commonly found as a contaminant in algal or ciliate cultures, feeds by attaching to its prey and ingesting prey cytoplasm through an extensible peduncle. Two related genera, &quot;Polykrikos&quot; and &quot;Neatodinium&quot;, shoot out a harpoon-like organelle to capture prey.

Some mixotrophic dinoflagellates are able to produce neurotoxins that have anti-grazing effects on larger copepods and enhance the ability of the dinoflagellate to prey upon larger copepods. Toxic strains of &quot;Karlodinium veneficum&quot; produce karlotoxin that kills predators who ingest them, thus reducing predatory populations and allowing blooms of both toxic and non-toxic strains of &quot;K. veneficum&quot;. Further, the production of karlotoxin enhances the predatory ability of &quot;K. veneficum&quot; by immobilizing its larger prey. &quot;K. armiger&quot; are more inclined to prey upon copepods by releasing a potent neurotoxin that immobilizes its prey upon contact. When &quot;K. armiger&quot; are present in large enough quantities, they are able to cull whole populations of their copepod prey.

The feeding mechanisms of the oceanic dinoflagellates remain unknown, although pseudopodial extensions were observed in &quot;Podolampas bipes&quot;.

=== Pigments in dinoflagellates ===
Dinoflagellates possess a distinctive suite of photosynthetic pigments that allow them to survive and grow in a variety of aquatic environments. Like other phytoplankton, many dinoflagellates contain chlorophyll a and chlorophyll c, which are essential for photosynthesis and light energy capture. However, unlike green algae and higher plants, they lack chlorophyll b. Instead, they utilize chlorophyll c2, which is more efficient for absorbing blue-green light, making them well adapted to low-light or deeper water conditions. These pigments, along with carotenoids, contribute to the characteristic coloration of dinoflagellates, which can range from golden-brown to red.

A unique pigment in dinoflagellates is peridinin, a specialized carotenoid that plays a key role in light harvesting and energy transfer to chlorophyll a. Peridinin is highly efficient in capturing blue light, which penetrates deeper into the water column, giving many dinoflagellates a competitive advantage in stratified or turbid environments. Additionally, dinoflagellates contain other carotenoids such as diadinoxanthin and dinoxanthin, which play important roles in photoprotection by dissipating excess light energy and preventing oxidative stress under high irradiance. These pigments are necessary for photoacclimation, allowing dinoflagellates to survive under fluctuating light conditions.

Not all dinoflagellates rely solely on photosynthetic pigments for energy. Many species are heterotrophic or mixotrophic, meaning they can acquire nutrients through both photosynthesis and predation. Symbiotic dinoflagellates, such as Symbiodinium, play a important ecological role by forming mutualistic relationships with corals, where their pigments drive photosynthesis and energy production that sustain coral reef ecosystems. The unique pigment composition of dinoflagellates also contributes to large-scale phenomena such as harmful algal blooms and red tides, where high concentrations of pigmented cells cause dramatic discoloration of coastal waters and can produce toxic effects.

===Blooms===
====Introduction====
Dinoflagellate blooms are generally unpredictable, short, with low species diversity, and with little species succession. The low species diversity can be due to multiple factors. One way a lack of diversity may occur in a bloom is through a reduction in predation and a decreased competition. The first may be achieved by having predators reject the dinoflagellate, by, for example, decreasing the amount of food it can eat. This additionally helps prevent a future increase in predation pressure by causing predators that reject it to lack the energy to breed. A species can then inhibit the growth of its competitors, thus achieving dominance.

====Harmful algal blooms====

Dinoflagellates sometimes bloom in concentrations of more than a million cells per millilitre. Under such circumstances, they can produce toxins (generally called dinotoxins) in quantities capable of killing fish and accumulating in filter feeders such as shellfish, which in turn may be passed on to people who eat them. This phenomenon is called a red tide, from the color the bloom imparts to the water. Some colorless dinoflagellates may also form toxic blooms, such as &quot;Pfiesteria&quot;. Some dinoflagellate blooms are not dangerous. Bluish flickers visible in ocean water at night often come from blooms of bioluminescent dinoflagellates, which emit short flashes of light when disturbed.

A red tide occurs because dinoflagellates are able to reproduce rapidly and copiously as a result of the abundant nutrients in the water. Although the resulting red waves are an interesting visual phenomenon, they contain toxins that not only affect all marine life in the ocean, but the people who consume them as well. A specific carrier is shellfish. This can introduce both nonfatal and fatal illnesses. One such poison is saxitoxin, a powerful paralytic neurotoxin.

Human inputs of phosphate further encourage these red tides, so strong interest exists in learning more about dinoflagellates, from both medical and economic perspectives. Dinoflagellates are known to be particularly capable of scavenging dissolved organic phosphorus for P-nutrient, several HAS species have been found to be highly versatile and mechanistically diversified in utilizing different types of DOPs. The ecology of harmful algal blooms is extensively studied.

===Bioluminescence===
At night, water can have an appearance of sparkling light due to the bioluminescence of dinoflagellates. More than 18 genera of dinoflagellates are bioluminescent, and the majority of them emit a blue-green light. These species contain scintillons, individual cytoplasmic bodies (about 0.5 μm in diameter) distributed mainly in the cortical region of the cell, outpockets of the main cell vacuole. They contain dinoflagellate luciferase, the main enzyme involved in dinoflagellate bioluminescence, and luciferin, a chlorophyll-derived tetrapyrrole ring that acts as the substrate to the light-producing reaction. The luminescence occurs as a brief (0.1 sec) blue flash (max 476 nm) when stimulated, usually by mechanical disturbance. Therefore, when mechanically stimulated—by boat, swimming, or waves, for example—a blue sparkling light can be seen emanating from the sea surface.

Dinoflagellate bioluminescence is controlled by a circadian clock and only occurs at night. Luminescent and nonluminescent strains can occur in the same species. The number of scintillons is higher during night than during day, and breaks down during the end of the night, at the time of maximal bioluminescence.

The luciferin-luciferase reaction responsible for the bioluminescence is pH sensitive. When the pH drops, luciferase changes its shape, allowing luciferin, more specifically tetrapyrrole, to bind. Dinoflagellates can use bioluminescence as a defense mechanism. They can startle their predators by their flashing light or they can ward off potential predators by an indirect effect such as the &quot;burglar alarm&quot;. The bioluminescence attracts attention to the dinoflagellate and its attacker, making the predator more vulnerable to predation from higher trophic levels.

Bioluminescent dinoflagellate ecosystem bays are among the rarest and most fragile, with the most famous ones being the Bioluminescent Bay in La Parguera, Lajas, Puerto Rico; Mosquito Bay in Vieques, Puerto Rico; and Las Cabezas de San Juan Reserva Natural Fajardo, Puerto Rico. Also, a bioluminescent lagoon is near Montego Bay, Jamaica, and bioluminescent harbors surround Castine, Maine. Within the United States, Central Florida is home to the Indian River Lagoon which is abundant with dinoflagellates in the summer and bioluminescent ctenophore in the winter.

===Lipid and sterol production===
Dinoflagellates produce characteristic lipids and sterols. One of these sterols is typical of dinoflagellates and is called dinosterol.

===Transport===

Dinoflagellate theca can sink rapidly to the seafloor in marine snow.

==Life cycle==
===Introduction===
Dinoflagellates have a haplontic life cycle, with the possible exception of &quot;Noctiluca&quot; and its relatives. 
The life cycle usually involves asexual reproduction by means of mitosis, either through desmoschisis or eleuteroschisis. More complex life cycles occur, more particularly with parasitic dinoflagellates. Sexual reproduction also occurs, though this mode of reproduction is only known in a small percentage of dinoflagellates. This takes place by fusion of two individuals to form a zygote, which may remain mobile in typical dinoflagellate fashion and is then called a planozygote. This zygote may later form a resting stage or hypnozygote, which is called a dinoflagellate cyst or dinocyst. After (or before) germination of the cyst, the hatchling undergoes meiosis to produce new haploid cells. Dinoflagellates appear to be capable of carrying out several DNA repair processes that can deal with different types of DNA damage.



===Dinoflagellate cysts===
The life cycle of many dinoflagellates includes at least one nonflagellated benthic stage as a cyst. Different types of dinoflagellate cysts are mainly defined based on morphological (number and type of layers in the cell wall) and functional (long- or short-term endurance) differences. These characteristics were initially thought to clearly distinguish pellicle (thin-walled) cysts from resting (double-walled) dinoflagellate cysts. The former were considered short-term (temporal) and the latter long-term (resting) cysts. However, during the last two decades further knowledge has highlighted the great intricacy of dinoflagellate life histories.

More than 10% of the approximately 2000 known marine dinoflagellate species produce cysts as part of their life cycle (see diagram on the right). These benthic phases play an important role in the ecology of the species, as part of a planktonic-benthic link in which the cysts remain in the sediment layer during conditions unfavorable for vegetative growth and, from there, reinoculate the water column when favorable conditions are restored.

Indeed, during dinoflagellate evolution the need to adapt to fluctuating environments and/or to seasonality is thought to have driven the development of this life cycle stage. Most protists form dormant cysts in order to withstand starvation and UV damage. However, there are enormous differences in the main phenotypic, physiological and resistance properties of each dinoflagellate species cysts. Unlike in higher plants most of this variability, for example in dormancy periods, has not been proven yet to be attributed to latitude adaptation or to depend on other life cycle traits. Thus, despite recent advances in the understanding of the life histories of many dinoflagellate species, including the role of cyst stages, many gaps remain in knowledge about their origin and functionality.

Recognition of the capacity of dinoflagellates to encyst dates back to the early 20th century, in biostratigraphic studies of fossil dinoflagellate cysts. Paul Reinsch was the first to identify cysts as the fossilized remains of dinoflagellates. Later, cyst formation from gamete fusion was reported, which led to the conclusion that encystment is associated with sexual reproduction. These observations also gave credence to the idea that microalgal encystment is essentially a process whereby zygotes prepare themselves for a dormant period. Because the resting cysts studied until that time came from sexual processes, dormancy was associated with sexuality, a presumption that was maintained for many years. This attribution was coincident with evolutionary theories about the origin of eukaryotic cell fusion and sexuality, which postulated advantages for species with diploid resting stages, in their ability to withstand nutrient stress and mutational UV radiation through recombinational repair, and for those with haploid vegetative stages, as asexual division doubles the number of cells. Nonetheless, certain environmental conditions may limit the advantages of recombination and sexuality, such that in fungi, for example, complex combinations of haploid and diploid cycles have evolved that include asexual and sexual resting stages.

However, in the general life cycle of cyst-producing dinoflagellates as outlined in the 1960s and 1970s, resting cysts were assumed to be the fate of sexuality, which itself was regarded as a response to stress or unfavorable conditions. Sexuality involves the fusion of haploid gametes from motile planktonic vegetative stages to produce diploid planozygotes that eventually form cysts, or hypnozygotes, whose germination is subject to both endogenous and exogenous controls. Endogenously, a species-specific physiological maturation minimum period (dormancy) is mandatory before germination can occur. Thus, hypnozygotes were also referred to as &quot;resting&quot; or &quot;resistant&quot; cysts, in reference to this physiological trait and their capacity following dormancy to remain viable in the sediments for long periods of time. Exogenously, germination is only possible within a window of favorable environmental conditions.

Yet, with the discovery that planozygotes were also able to divide it became apparent that the complexity of dinoflagellate life cycles was greater than originally thought. Following corroboration of this behavior in several species, the capacity of dinoflagellate sexual phases to restore the vegetative phase, bypassing cyst formation, became well accepted. Further, in 2006 Kremp and Parrow showed the dormant resting cysts of the Baltic cold water dinoflagellates &quot;Scrippsiella hangoei&quot; and &quot;Gymnodinium&quot; sp. were formed by the direct encystment of haploid vegetative cells, i.e., asexually. In addition, for the zygotic cysts of &quot;Pfiesteria piscicida&quot; dormancy was not essential.

==Genomics==

One of the most striking features of dinoflagellates is the large amount of cellular DNA that they contain. Most eukaryotic algae contain on average about 0.54 pg DNA/cell, whereas estimates of dinoflagellate DNA content range from 3–250 pg/cell, corresponding to roughly 3000–215 000 Mb (in comparison, the haploid human genome is 3180 Mb and hexaploid &quot;Triticum&quot; wheat is 16 000 Mb). Polyploidy or polyteny may account for this large cellular DNA content, but earlier studies of DNA reassociation kinetics and recent genome analyses do not support this hypothesis. Rather, this has been attributed, hypothetically, to the rampant retroposition found in dinoflagellate genomes.

In addition to their disproportionately large genomes, dinoflagellate nuclei are unique in their morphology, regulation, and composition. Their DNA is so tightly packed that exactly how many chromosomes they have is still uncertain.

The dinoflagellates share an unusual mitochondrial genome organisation with their relatives, the Apicomplexa. Both groups have very reduced mitochondrial genomes (around 6 kilobases (kb) in the Apicomplexa vs ~16kb for human mitochondria). One species, &quot;Amoebophrya ceratii&quot;, has lost its mitochondrial genome completely, yet still has functional mitochondria. The genes on the dinoflagellate genomes have undergone a number of reorganisations, including massive genome amplification and recombination which have resulted in multiple copies of each gene and gene fragments linked in numerous combinations. Loss of the standard stop codons, trans-splicing of mRNAs for the mRNA of cox3, and extensive RNA editing recoding of most genes has occurred. The reasons for this transformation are unknown. In a small group of dinoflagellates, called &#x27;dinotoms&#x27; (Durinskia and Kryptoperidinium), the endosymbionts (diatoms) still have mitochondria, making them the only organisms with two evolutionarily distinct mitochondria.

In most of the species, the plastid genome consist of just 14 genes.

The DNA of the plastid in the peridinin-containing dinoflagellates is contained in a series of small circles called minicircles. Each circle contains one or two polypeptide genes. The genes for these polypeptides are chloroplast-specific because their homologs from other photosynthetic eukaryotes are exclusively encoded in the chloroplast genome. Within each circle is a distinguishable &#x27;core&#x27; region. Genes are always in the same orientation with respect to this core region.

In terms of DNA barcoding, ITS sequences can be used to identify species, where a genetic distance of p≥0.04 can be used to delimit species, which has been successfully applied to resolve long-standing taxonomic confusion as in the case of resolving the Alexandrium tamarense complex into five species. A recent study revealed a substantial proportion of dinoflagellate genes encode for unknown functions, and that these genes could be conserved and lineage-specific.

==Evolutionary history==

Dinoflagellates are mainly represented as fossils by dinocysts, which have a long geological record with lowest occurrences during the mid-Triassic, whilst geochemical markers suggest a presence to the Early Cambrian. Some evidence indicates dinosteroids in many Paleozoic and Precambrian rocks might be the product of ancestral dinoflagellates (protodinoflagellates). Dinoflagellates show a classic radiation of morphologies during the Late Triassic through the Middle Jurassic. More modern-looking forms proliferate during the later Jurassic and Cretaceous. This trend continues into the Cenozoic, albeit with some loss of diversity.

Molecular phylogenetics show that dinoflagellates are grouped with ciliates and apicomplexans (=Sporozoa) in a well-supported clade, the alveolates. The closest relatives to dinokaryotic dinoflagellates appear to be apicomplexans, &quot;Perkinsus, Parvilucifera&quot;, syndinians, and &quot;Oxyrrhis&quot;. Molecular phylogenies are similar to phylogenies based on morphology.

The earliest stages of dinoflagellate evolution appear to be dominated by parasitic lineages, such as perkinsids and syndinians (e.g. &quot;Amoebophrya&quot; and &quot;Hematodinium&quot;).

All dinoflagellates contain red algal plastids or remnant (nonphotosynthetic) organelles of red algal origin. The parasitic dinoflagellate &quot;Hematodinium&quot; however lacks a plastid entirely. Some groups that have lost the photosynthetic properties of their original red algae plastids has obtained new photosynthetic plastids (chloroplasts) through so-called serial endosymbiosis, both secondary and tertiary:
* &quot;Lepidodinium&quot; unusually possesses a green algae-derived plastid (all other serially-acquired plastids can be traced back to red algae). The plastid is most related to free-living &quot;Pedinomonas&quot; (hence likely secondary). Two previously undescribed dinoflagellates (&quot;MGD&quot; and &quot;TGD&quot;) contain a closely-related plastid.
* &quot;Karenia&quot;, &quot;Karlodinium&quot;, and &quot;Takayama&quot; possess plastids of haptophyte origin, produced in three separate events.
* &quot;Dinotoms&quot; (&quot;Durinskia&quot; and &quot;Kryptoperidinium&quot;) have plastids derived from diatoms.
Some species also perform kleptoplasty:
* &quot;Dinophysis&quot; have plastids from a cryptomonad, due to kleptoplasty from a cilate prey.
* The Kareniaceae (which contains the three haptophyte-having genera) contains two separate cases of kleptoplasty.

Dinoflagellate evolution has been summarized into five principal organizational types: prorocentroid, dinophysoid, gonyaulacoid, peridinioid, and gymnodinoid.
The transitions of marine species into fresh water have been frequent events during the diversification of dinoflagellates and have occurred recently.

Many dinoflagellates also have a symbiotic relationship with cyanobacteria, called cyanobionts, which have a reduced genome and has not been found outside their hosts. The Dinophysoid dinoflagellates have two genera, Amphisolenia and Triposolenia, that contain intracellular cyanobionts, and four genera; Citharistes, Histioneis, Parahistioneis, and Ornithocercus, that contain extracellular cyanobionts. Most of the cyanobionts are used for nitrogen fixation, not for photosynthesis, but some don&#x27;t have the ability to fix nitrogen. The dinoflagellate &quot;Ornithocercus magnificus&quot; is host for symbionts which resides in an extracellular chamber. While it is not fully known how the dinoflagellate benefit from it, it has been suggested it is farming the cyanobacteria in specialized chambers and regularly digest some of them.

Recently, the living fossil &quot;Dapsilidinium pastielsii&quot; was found inhabiting the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool, which served as a refugium for thermophilic dinoflagellates, and others such as &quot;Calciodinellum operosum&quot; and &quot;Posoniella tricarinelloides&quot; were also described from fossils before later being found alive.

<text>The alveolates (meaning &quot;pitted like a honeycomb&quot;) are a group of protists, considered a major clade and superphylum within Eukarya. They are currently grouped with the stramenopiles and Rhizaria among the protists with tubulocristate mitochondria into the SAR supergroup.

==Characteristics==
The most notable shared characteristic is the presence of cortical (near the surface) alveoli (sacs). These are flattened vesicles (sacs) arranged as a layer just under the membrane and supporting it, typically contributing to a flexible pellicle (thin skin). In armored dinoflagellates they may contain stiff plates. Alveolates have mitochondria with tubular cristae (invaginations), and cells often have pore-like intrusions through the cell surface. The group contains free-living and parasitic organisms, predatory flagellates, and photosynthetic organisms.

Almost all sequenced mitochondrial genomes of ciliates and apicomplexa are linear. The mitochondria almost all carry mtDNA of their own but with greatly reduced genome sizes. Exceptions are &quot;Cryptosporidium&quot; which are left with only a mitosome, the circular mitochondrial genomes of &quot;Acavomonas&quot; and &quot;Babesia microti&quot;, and &quot;Toxoplasma&quot;&#x27;s highly fragmented mitochondrial genome, consisting of 21 sequence blocks which recombine to produce longer segments.

==History==
The relationship of apicomplexa, dinoflagellates and ciliates had been suggested during the 1980s, and this was confirmed in the early 1990s by comparisons of ribosomal RNA sequences, most notably by Gajadhar &quot;et al&quot;. Cavalier-Smith introduced the formal name Alveolata in 1991, although at the time he considered the grouping to be a paraphyletic assemblage. Many biologists prefer the use of the colloquial name &#x27;alveolate&#x27;.

==Classification==
Alveolata include around nine major and minor groups. They are diverse in form, and are known to be related by various ultrastructural and genetic similarities:

*Ciliates – very common protozoa with many short cilia arranged in rows, and two nuclei
*Acavomonidia
*Colponemidia
*Dinoflagellates s.l. – mostly marine flagellates many of which have chloroplasts
*Perkinsozoa
*Chromerida – a marine phylum of photosynthetic protozoa
*Colpodellida
*Voromonadida
*Apicomplexa – parasitic and secondary non-photosynthetic protozoa that lack axonemal locomotive structures except in gametes

The Acavomonidia and Colponemidia were previously grouped together as colponemids, a taxon now split because each has a distinctive organization or ultrastructural identity. The Acavomonidia are closer to the dinoflagellate/perkinsid group than the Colponemidia are. As such, the informal term &quot;colponemids&quot;, as it stands currently, covers two non-sister groups within Alveolata: the Acavomonidia and the Colponemidia.

The Apicomplexa and dinoflagellates may be more closely related to each other than to the ciliates. Both have plastids, and most share a bundle or cone of microtubules at the top of the cell. In apicomplexans this forms part of a complex used to enter host cells, while in some colorless dinoflagellates it forms a peduncle used to ingest prey. Various other genera are closely related to these two groups, mostly flagellates with a similar apical structure. These include free-living members in &quot;Oxyrrhis&quot; and &quot;Colponema&quot;, and parasites in &quot;Perkinsus&quot;, &quot;Parvilucifera&quot;, &quot;Rastrimonas&quot; and the ellobiopsids. In 2001, direct amplification of the rRNA gene in marine picoplankton samples revealed the presence of two novel alveolate lineages, called group I and II. Group I has no cultivated relatives, while group II is related to the dinoflagellate parasite &quot;Amoebophrya&quot;, which was classified until now in the Syndiniales dinoflagellate order.

Some studies suggested the haplosporids, mostly parasites of marine invertebrates, might belong here, but they lack alveoli and are now placed among the Cercozoa.

The ellobiopsids are of uncertain relation within the alveolates. Silberman et al 2004 establish that the &quot;Thalassomyces&quot; genus of ellobiopsids are alveolates using phylogenetic analysis, however no more certainty exists on their place.

===Phylogeny===

In 2017, Thomas Cavalier-Smith described the phylogeny of the Alveolata as follows:

==Development==
The development of plastids among the alveolates is intriguing. Cavalier-Smith proposed the alveolates developed from a chloroplast-containing ancestor, which also gave rise to the Chromista (the chromalveolate hypothesis). Other researchers have speculated that the alveolates originally lacked plastids and possibly the dinoflagellates and Apicomplexa acquired them separately. However, it now appears that the alveolates, the dinoflagellates, the Chromerida and the heterokont algae acquired their plastids from a red alga with evidence of a common origin of this organelle in all these four clades.

==Evolution==
A Bayesian estimate places the evolution of the alveolate group at ~. The Alveolata consist of Myzozoa, Ciliates, and Colponemids. In other words, the term Myzozoa, meaning &quot;to siphon the contents from prey&quot;, may be applied informally to the common ancestor of the subset of alveolates that are neither ciliates nor colponemids. Predation upon algae is an important driver in alveolate evolution, as it can provide sources for endosymbiosis of novel plastids. The term Myzozoa is therefore a handy concept for tracking the history of the alveolate phylum.

The ancestors of the alveolate group may have been photosynthetic. The ancestral alveolate probably possessed a plastid. Chromerids, apicomplexans, and peridinin dinoflagellates have retained this organelle. Going one step even further back, the chromerids, the peridinin dinoflagellates and the heterokont algae have been argued to possess a monophyletic plastid lineage in common, i.e. acquired their plastids from a red alga, and so it seems likely that the common ancestor of alveolates and heterokonts was also photosynthetic.

In one school of thought the common ancestor of the dinoflagellates, apicomplexans, &quot;Colpodella&quot;, Chromerida, and &quot;Voromonas&quot; was a myzocytotic predator with two heterodynamic flagella, micropores, trichocysts, rhoptries, micronemes, a polar ring and a coiled open sided conoid. While the common ancestor of alveolates may also have possessed some of these characteristics, it has been argued that Myzocytosis was not one of these characteristics, as ciliates ingest prey by a different mechanism.

An ongoing debate concerns the number of membranes surrounding the plastid across apicomplexans and certain dinoflagellates, and the origin of these membranes. This ultrastructural character can be used to group organisms and if the character is in common, it can imply that phyla had a common photosynthetic ancestor. On the basis that apicomplexans possess a plastid surrounded by four membranes, and that peridinin dinoflagellates possess a plastid surrounded by three membranes, Petersen et al. have been unable to rule out that the shared stramenopile-alveolate plastid could have been recycled multiple times in the alveolate phylum, the source being stramenopile-alveolate donors, through the mechanism of ingestion and endosymbiosis.

Ciliates are a model alveolate, having been genetically studied in great depth over the longest period of any alveolate lineage. They are unusual among eukaryotes in that reproduction involves a micronucleus and a macronucleus. Their reproduction is easily studied in the lab, and made them a model eukaryote historically. Being entirely predatory and lacking any remnant plastid, their development as a phylum illustrates how predation and autotrophy are in dynamic balance and that the balance can swing one way or other at the point of origin of a new phylum from mixotrophic ancestors, causing one ability to be lost.

== Epigenetics ==
Few algae have been studied for epigenetics. Those for which epigenetic data are available include some algal alveolates.

<text>The cryptomonads (or cryptophytes) are a group of algae, most of which have plastids. They are traditionally considered a division of algae among phycologists, under the name of Cryptophyta. They are common in freshwater, and also occur in marine and brackish habitats. Each cell is around 10–50 μm in size and flattened in shape, with an anterior groove or pocket. At the edge of the pocket there are typically two slightly unequal flagella. Some may exhibit mixotrophy. They are classified as clade Cryptomonada, which is divided into two classes: heterotrophic Goniomonadea and phototrophic Cryptophyceae. The two groups are united under three shared morphological characteristics: presence of a periplast, ejectisomes with secondary scroll, and mitochondrial cristae with flat tubules. Genetic studies as early as 1994 also supported the hypothesis that &quot;Goniomonas&quot; was sister to Cryptophyceae. A study in 2018 found strong evidence that the common ancestor of &quot;Cryptomonada&quot; was an autotrophic protist.
==Characteristics==
Cryptomonads are distinguished by the presence of characteristic extrusomes called ejectosomes, which consist of two connected spiral ribbons held under tension. If the cells are irritated either by mechanical, chemical or light stress, they discharge, propelling the cell in a zig-zag course away from the disturbance. Large ejectosomes, visible under the light microscope, are associated with the pocket; smaller ones occur underneath the periplast, the cryptophyte-specific cell surrounding.

Except for the class &quot;Goniomonadea&quot;, which lacks plastids entirely, and &quot;Cryptomonas paramecium&quot; (previously called &quot;Chilomonas paramecium&quot;), which has leucoplasts, cryptomonads have one or two chloroplasts. These contain chlorophylls &quot;a&quot; and &quot;c&quot;, together with phycobiliproteins and other pigments, and vary in color (brown, red to blueish-green). Each is surrounded by four membranes, and there is a reduced cell nucleus called a nucleomorph between the middle two. This indicates that the plastid was derived from a eukaryotic symbiont, shown by genetic studies to have been a red alga. However, the plastids are very different from red algal plastids: phycobiliproteins are present but only in the thylakoid lumen and are present only as phycoerythrin or phycocyanin. In the case of &quot;Rhodomonas&quot;, the crystal structure has been determined to 1.63Å; and it has been shown that the alpha subunit bears no relation to any other known phycobiliprotein.

A few cryptomonads, such as &quot;Cryptomonas&quot;, can form stages, but readily escape the surrounding mucus to become free-living flagellates again. Some &quot;Cryptomonas&quot; species may also form immotile microbial cysts—resting stages with rigid cell walls to survive unfavorable conditions. Cryptomonad flagella are inserted parallel to one another, and are covered by bipartite hairs called mastigonemes, formed within the endoplasmic reticulum and transported to the cell surface. Small scales may also be present on the flagella and cell body. The mitochondria have flat cristae, and mitosis is open; sexual reproduction has also been reported.

==Classification==


The first mention of cryptomonads appears to have been made by Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg in 1831, while studying Infusoria. Later, botanists treated them as a separate algae group, class Cryptophyceae or division Cryptophyta, while zoologists treated them as the flagellate protozoa order Cryptomonadina. In some classifications, the cryptomonads were considered close relatives of the dinoflagellates because of their (seemingly) similar pigmentation, being grouped as the Pyrrhophyta. Cryptomonad chloroplasts are closely related to those of the heterokonts and haptophytes, and the three groups were united by Cavalier-Smith as the Chromista. However, the case that the organisms themselves are closely related was counter-indicated by the major differences in cell organization (ultrastructural identity), suggesting that the three major lineages assigned to the chromists had acquired plastids independently, and that chromists are polyphyletic. The perspective that cryptomonads are primitively heterotrophic and secondarily acquired chloroplasts, is supported by molecular evidence. Parfrey et al. and Burki et al. placed Cryptophyceae as a sister clade to the Green Algae, or green algae plus glaucophytes. The sister group to the cryptomonads is likely the kathablepharids (also referred to as katablepharids), a group of flagellates that also have ejectisomes.

One suggested grouping is as follows: (1) &quot;Cryptomonas&quot;, (2) &quot;Chroomonas/Komma&quot; and &quot;Hemiselmis&quot;, (3) &quot;Rhodomonas/Rhinomonas/Storeatula&quot;, (4) &quot;Guillardia/Hanusia&quot;, (5) &quot;Geminigera/Plagioselmis/Teleaulax&quot;, (6) &quot;Proteomonas sulcata&quot;, (7) &quot;Falcomonas daucoides&quot;.

<text>Year 229 BC was a year of the pre-Julian Roman calendar. At the time it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Albinus and Centumalus (or, less frequently, year 525 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 229 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Anatolia ====
* Attalus I of Pergamon wins the Battle of the Harpasus in western Anatolia.

==== Illyria ====
* The First Illyrian War started when the Roman Senate dispatched an army under the command of the consuls Lucius Postumius Albinus and Gnaeus Fulvius Centumalus to Illyria. Rome forced the withdrawal of Illyrian garrisons in the Greek cities of Epidamnus, Apollonia, Corcyra and Pharos and establishes a protectorate over these Greek towns.
* The Illyrian tribe of the Ardiaei is subdued by the Romans.
* The King of Macedonia, Demetrius II, dies. His nephew, Antigonus III comes to the Macedonian throne as regent for his half-cousin and the future king Philip V, who is only ten years old.
* Concerned at Rome&#x27;s expansion, Antigonus III pursues a policy of befriending the Illyrians, even though the Greeks in the region support Rome in quelling the Illyrian pirates.
* The involvement of Rome in Illyria led to the establishment of friendly relations between Rome and the enemies of Macedonia: the Aetolian League and Achaean League, which approve the suppression of Illyrian piracy.
* Aratus of Sicyon brings Argos into the Achaean League and then helps liberate Athens. This brings Aratus into conflict with Sparta.

==== China ====
* The Qin general Wang Jian launches a three-pronged invasion of the state of Zhao but is hindered by the Zhao general Li Mu.
* The Zhao Prime Minister Guo Kai, influenced by the machinations of Qin, executes Li Mu. 
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Lucius Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus, Roman consul and general (d. 160 BC)
* Qin Er Shi, Chinese emperor of the Qin Dynasty (d. 207 BC)
* Titus Quinctius Flaminius, Roman consul and general (d. 174 BC)

== Deaths ==
* Demetrius II, Macedonian king from 239 BC (b. c. 276 BC)
* Li Mu, Chinese general of the Zhao State (Warring States Period)
* Margos of Keryneia, Greek general of the Achaean League

<text>Pfizer Inc. ( ) is an American multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporation headquartered at The Spiral in Manhattan, New York City. Founded in 1849 in New York by German entrepreneurs Charles Pfizer (1824–1906) and Charles F. Erhart (1821–1891), Pfizer is one of the oldest pharmaceutical companies in North America.

Pfizer develops and produces medicines and vaccines for immunology, oncology, cardiology, endocrinology, and neurology. The company&#x27;s largest products by sales are the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine ($11 billion in 2023 revenues), apixaban ($6 billion in 2023 revenues), a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine ($6 billion in 2023 revenues), palbociclib ($4 billion in 2023 revenues), and tafamidis ($3 billion in 2023 revenues). In 2023, 46% of the company&#x27;s revenues came from the United States, 6% came from Japan, and 48% came from other countries.

Pfizer has been a publicly traded company for nearly a century, making its debut on the New York Stock Exchange in 1942 under the ticker symbol PFE. Pfizer is part of major stock indices like the S&amp;P 100 and S&amp;P 500, having major institutional investors.

Pfizer is one of the top pharmaceutical companies in the United States, with a market capitalization of $150.35 billion as of December 31, 2024. It ranks fifth among U.S. pharma companies. As of 2024, the company holds the 69th position on the Fortune 500 list.

==History==
=== 1849–1950: Early history ===
Pfizer was founded in 1849 as &quot;Charles Pfizer &amp; Company&quot; by Charles Pfizer and Charles F. Erhart, two cousins who had immigrated to the United States from Ludwigsburg, Germany. The business produced chemical compounds, and was headquartered on Bartlett Street in Williamsburgh, New York where they produced an antiparasitic called santonin. This was an immediate success, although it was production of citric acid that led to Pfizer&#x27;s growth in the 1880s. Pfizer continued to buy property in the area (by now the Williamsburg district of the city of Brooklyn, New York and beginning in 1898, the City of Greater New York) to expand its lab and factory, retaining offices on Flushing Avenue until the 1960s; the Brooklyn plant ultimately closed in 2009. Following their success with citric acid, Pfizer (at the now-demolished 295 Washington Avenue) and Erhart (at 280 Washington Avenue) established their main residences in the nearby Clinton Hill district, known for its concentration of Gilded Age wealth.

In 1881, Pfizer moved its administrative headquarters to 81 Maiden Lane in Manhattan, presaging the company&#x27;s expansion to Chicago, Illinois a year later. By 1906 sales exceeded $3million.

World War I caused a shortage of calcium citrate. Pfizer imported the compound from Italy for the manufacture of citric acid, and due to the disruption in supply, the company began a search for an alternative. They found this in the form of a fungus capable of fermenting sugar to citric acid. By 1919, the company was able to commercialize production of citric acid from this source. The company developed expertise in fermentation technology as a result. These skills were applied to the deep-submergence mass production of penicillin, an antibiotic, during World War II in response to the need to treat injured Allied soldiers. The company also embarked on a global soil collection program related to improving production yields of penicillin which ultimately resulted in 135,000 samples.

On June 2, 1942, the company incorporated under the Delaware General Corporation Law.

=== 1950–1980: Pivot to pharmaceutical research and global expansion ===
Due to price declines for penicillin, Pfizer searched for new antibiotics with greater profit potential. Pfizer discovered oxytetracycline in 1950, and this changed the company from a manufacturer of fine chemicals to a research-based pharmaceutical company. Pfizer developed a drug discovery program focused on in vitro synthesis to augment its research in fermentation technology. In 1959, the company established an animal health division with a farm and research facility in Terre Haute, Indiana.

By the 1950s, Pfizer had established offices in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Cuba, Mexico, Panama, Puerto Rico, and the United Kingdom. In 1960, the company moved its medical research laboratory operations out of New York City to a new facility in Groton, Connecticut. In 1980, Pfizer launched Feldene (piroxicam), a prescription anti-inflammatory medication that became Pfizer&#x27;s first product to reach $1billion in revenue.

In 1965, John Powers, Jr. became chief executive officer of the company, succeeding John McKeen.

As the area surrounding its Brooklyn, NY plant fell into decline in the 1970s and 1980s, the company formed a public-private partnership with New York City that encompassed the construction of low- and middle-income housing, the refurbishment of apartment buildings for the homeless and the establishment of a charter school.

In 1972, Edmund T. Pratt Jr. became chief executive officer of the company, succeeding John Powers, Jr.

=== 1980–2000: Development of Viagra, Zoloft, and Lipitor ===
In 1981, the company received approval for Diflucan (fluconazole), the first oral treatment for severe fungal infections including candidiasis, blastomycosis, coccidiodomycosis, cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, dermatophytosis, and pityriasis versicolor.

In 1986, Pfizer acquired the worldwide rights to Zithromax (azithromycin), a macrolide antibiotic that is recommended by the Infectious Disease Society of America as a first line treatment for certain cases of community-acquired pneumonia, from Pliva.

In 1989, Pfizer scientists Peter Dunn and Albert Wood created Viagra (sildenafil) for treating high blood pressure and angina, a chest pain associated with coronary artery disease. In 1991, it was patented in the United Kingdom as a heart medication. Early trials for the medication showed that it did not work for the treatment of heart disease, but volunteers in the clinical trials had increased erections several days after taking the drug. It was patented in the United States in 1996 and received approval by the Food and Drug Administration in March 1998. In December 1998, Pfizer hired Bob Dole as a spokesperson for the drug. The patents for Viagra expired in 2020.

In 1991, William C. Steere, Jr. became chief executive officers of the company, succeeding Edmund T. Pratt Jr.

In 1991 Pfizer also began marketing Zoloft (sertraline), an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class developed nine years earlier by Pfizer chemists Kenneth Koe and Willard Welch. Sertraline is primarily prescribed for major depressive disorder in adult outpatients as well as obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, and social anxiety disorder in both adults and children. In 2005, the year before it became a generic drug, sales were over $3billion and over 100million people had been treated with the drug. The patent for Zoloft expired in the summer of 2006.

In 1996, Eisai, in partnership with Pfizer, received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for donepezil under the brand Aricept for treatment of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease; Pfizer also received approval for Norvasc (amlodipine), an antihypertensive drug of the dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker class.
In 1997, the company entered into a co-marketing agreement with Warner–Lambert for Lipitor (atorvastatin), a statin for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Although atorvastatin was the fifth statin to be developed, clinical trials showed that atorvastatin caused a more dramatic reduction in low-density lipoprotein pattern C (LDL-C) than the other statin drugs. Upon its patent expiration in 2011, Lipitor was the best-selling drug ever, with approximately $125billion in sales over 14.5 years.

=== 2000–2010: Further expansion ===
In 2001, Henry McKinnell became chief executive officer of the company, replacing William C. Steere, Jr.

In 2002, The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation purchased stock in Pfizer.

In 2004, the company received approval for Lyrica (pregabalin), an anticonvulsant and anxiolytic medication used to treat epilepsy, neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia, restless leg syndrome, and generalized anxiety disorder. The United States patent on Lyrica was challenged by generic manufacturers and was upheld in 2014, extending the expiration date to 2018.

In July 2006, Jeff Kindler was named chief executive officer of the company, replacing Henry McKinnell.

On December 3, 2006, Pfizer ceased development of torcetrapib, a drug that increases production of HDL, which reduces LDL thought to be correlated to heart disease. During a Phase III clinical trial involving 15,000 patients, more deaths than expected occurred in the group that took the medicine, and the mortality rate of patients taking the combination of torcetrapib and Lipitor (82 deaths during the study) was 60% higher than those taking Lipitor alone (52 deaths during the study). Lipitor alone was not implicated in the results, but Pfizer lost nearly $1billion developing the failed drug and its stock price dropped 11% on the day of the announcement.

Between 2007 and 2010, Pfizer spent $3.3million on investigations and legal fees and recovered about $5.1million, and had another $5million of pending recoveries from civil lawsuits against makers of counterfeit prescription drugs. Pfizer has hired customs and narcotics experts worldwide to track down fakes and assemble evidence that can be used to pursue civil suits for trademark infringement.

In July 2008, Pfizer announced 275 job cuts at its manufacturing facility in Portage, Michigan. Portage was previously the world headquarters of Upjohn Company, which had been acquired as part of Pharmacia.

==== Acquisitions and mergers ====
In June 2000, Pfizer acquired Warner-Lambert outright for $116billion. To satisfy conditions imposed by antitrust regulators at the Federal Trade Commission, Pfizer sold off or transferred stakes in several minor products, including RID (a shampoo for treatment of head lice, sold to Bayer) and Warner-Lambert&#x27;s antidepressant Celexa (which competes with Zoloft). The acquisition created what was, at the time, the second-largest pharmaceutical company worldwide.

In 2003, Pfizer merged with Pharmacia, and in the process acquired Searle and SUGEN. Searle had developed Flagyl (metronidazole), a nitroimidazole antibiotic medication used particularly for anaerobic bacteria and protozoa. Searle also developed celecoxib (Celebrex) a COX-2 inhibitor and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to treat the pain and inflammation in osteoarthritis, acute pain in adults, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, painful menstruation, and juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. SUGEN, a company focused on protein kinase inhibitors, had pioneered the use of ATP-mimetic small molecules to block signal transduction. The SUGEN facility was shut down in 2003 by Pfizer, with the loss of more than 300 jobs, and several programs were transferred to Pfizer. These included sunitinib (Sutent), a cancer medication which was approved for human use by the FDA in January 2006. A related compound, SU11654 (Toceranib), was also approved for cancer in dogs, and the ALK inhibitor Crizotinib also grew out of a SUGEN program.

In October 2006, the company announced it would acquire PowerMed.

On October 15, 2009, Pfizer acquired Wyeth for $68billion in cash and stock, including the assumption of debt, making Pfizer the largest pharmaceutical company in the world. The acquisition of Wyeth provided Pfizer with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, trademarked Prevnar 13; this is used for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal infections. The introduction of the original, 7-valent version of the vaccine, developed by Wyeth in February 2000, led to a 75% reduction in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal infections among children under age5 in the United States. Pfizer introduced an improved version of the vaccine in 2010, for which it was granted a patent in India in 2017. Prevnar 13 provides coverage of 13 bacterial variants, expanding beyond the original 7-valent version. By 2012, the rate of invasive infections among children under age5 had been reduced by an additional 50%.

=== 2010–2020: Further discoveries and acquisitions ===

In 2010, Ian Read was named chief executive officer of the company.

In February 2011, Pfizer announced the closure of its UK research and development facility (formerly also a manufacturing plant) in Sandwich, Kent, which at the time employed 2,400 people. In March 2011, Pfizer acquired King Pharmaceuticals for $3.6billion in cash. King produced emergency injectables such as the EpiPen.

On September 4, 2012, the FDA approved bosutinib (Bosulif) for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a rare type of leukemia and a blood and bone marrow disease that affects primarily older adults. In November 2012, Pfizer received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for Xeljanz, a tofacitinib, for rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis. The drug had sales of $1.77billion in 2018, and in January 2019, it was the top drug in the United States for direct-to-consumer advertising, passing adalimumab (Humira). In 2023, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) identified Xeljanz (tofacitinib) as one of five high-expenditure drugs that experienced significant net price increases without new clinical evidence to justify the hikes. Specifically, Xeljanz&#x27;s wholesale acquisition cost rose by 6%, leading to an additional $72 million in costs to U.S. payers.

On February 1, 2013, Zoetis, the Agriculture Division of Pfizer and later Pfizer Animal Health, became a public company via an initial public offering, raising $2.2billion. Later in 2013, Pfizer completed the corporate spin-off of its remaining stake in Zoetis.

In September 2014, the company acquired Innopharma for $225million, plus up to $135million in milestone payments, in a deal that expanded Pfizer&#x27;s range of generic and injectable drugs.

On January 5, 2015, the company announced it would acquire a controlling interest in Redvax, expanding its vaccine portfolio targeting human cytomegalovirus. In February 2015, the company received approval from the Food and Drug Administration for palbociclib (Ibrance) for treatment of certain types of breast cancer. In March 2015, the company announced it would restart its collaboration with Eli Lilly and Company surrounding the Phase III trial of Tanezumab. In May 2015, Pfizer and a Bar-Ilan University laboratory announced a partnership based on the development of medical DNA nanotechnology. In June 2015, the company acquired Nimenrix and Mencevax, meningococcal vaccines, from GlaxoSmithKline for around $130million. In September 2015, Pfizer acquired Hospira for $17billion, including the assumption of debt. Hospira was the largest producer of generic injectable pharmaceuticals in the world. On November 23, 2015, Pfizer and Allergan announced a planned $160billion merger, in the largest pharmaceutical deal ever and the third largest corporate merger in history. The proposed transaction contemplated that the merged company maintain Allergan&#x27;s Republic of Ireland domicile, resulting in the new company being subject to corporation tax at the relatively low rate of 12.5%. The deal was to constitute a reverse merger, whereby Allergan acquired Pfizer, with the new company then changing its name to &quot;Pfizer, plc&quot;. On April 6, 2016, Pfizer and Allergan terminated the merger agreement after the Obama administration and the United States Department of the Treasury introduced new laws intended to limit corporate inversions (the extent to which companies could move their headquarters overseas in order to reduce the amount of taxes they pay).

In June 2016, the company acquired Anacor Pharmaceuticals for $5.2billion, expanding its portfolio in both inflammation and immunology drugs areas. In August 2016, the company made a $40million bid for the assets of BIND Therapeutics, which was in bankruptcy. The same month, the company acquired Bamboo Therapeutics for $645million, expanding its gene therapy offerings. In September 2016, the company acquired cancer drug-maker Medivation for $14billion. In October 2016, the company licensed the anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody, ONC-392, from OncoImmune. In November 2016, Pfizer funded a $3,435,600 study with the CDC Foundation to research &quot;screen-and-treat&quot; strategies for cryptococcal disease in Botswana. In December 2016, Pfizer acquired AstraZeneca&#x27;s small-molecule antibiotics business for $1.575 billion.

In January 2018, Pfizer announced that it would end its work on research into treatments for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and Parkinsonism (a symptom of Parkinson&#x27;s disease and other conditions). The company said about 300 researchers would lose their jobs. In July 2018, the Food and Drug Administration approved enzalutamide, developed by Pfizer and Astellas Pharma for patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. In August 2018, Pfizer signed an agreement with BioNTech to conduct joint research and development activities regarding mRNA-based influenza vaccines. In October 2018, effective January 1, 2019, Albert Bourla was promoted to chief executive officer, succeeding Ian Read, his mentor.
In July 2019, the company acquired Therachon for up to $810million, expanding its rare disease portfolio through Therachon&#x27;s recombinant human fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 compound, aimed at treating conditions such as achondroplasia. Also in July, Pfizer acquired Array Biopharma for $10.6billion, boosting its oncology pipeline. In August 2019, Pfizer merged its consumer health business with that of GlaxoSmithKline, into a joint venture owned 68% by GlaxoSmithKline and 32% by Pfizer, with plans to make it a public company. The transaction built on a 2018 transaction where GlaxoSmithKline acquired Novartis&#x27; stake in the GSK-Novartis consumer healthcare joint business. The transaction followed negotiations with other companies including Reckitt Benckiser, Sanofi, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and Procter &amp; Gamble. In September 2019, Pfizer initiated a study with the CDC Foundation to investigate the tracking of healthcare-associated infections, scheduled to run through to June 2023. In December 2019, Pfizer awarded the CDC Foundation a further $1,948,482 to continue its cryptococcal disease screening and treatment research in nine African countries.

===2020: COVID-19 pandemic and vaccine development ===

In March 2020, Pfizer joined the COVID-19 Therapeutics Accelerator funding vehicle to expedite development of treatments against COVID-19. The $125 million initiative was launched by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation in partnership with Mastercard and Wellcome Trust, with additional funding announced shortly after from Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, UK Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and Madonna.

The following month, the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health announced the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) public-private partnership to develop a coordinated research strategy for prioritizing and speeding up development of COVID-19 vaccines and pharmaceutical products. Pfizer joined the partnership as an industry &quot;leadership organization&quot;, and participated as a collaborator in ACTIV-led clinical trials. CEO Albert Bourla attended the GAVI COVAX AMC 2021 Investment Opportunity Launch Event, otherwise named One World Protected, on April 15, 2021.

In Canada, Pfizer endorsed the use of a vaccine passport mobile app developed by CANImmunize in order to record and track status of COVID-19 vaccination.

As the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic became apparent, Pfizer partnered with BioNTech to study and develop COVID-19 mRNA vaccine candidates. Unlike many of its competitors, Pfizer took no initial research funds from the United States&#x27; Operation Warp Speed vaccine development program, instead choosing to invest roughly $2 billion of its own funds. Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla has said that he declined money from Operation Warp Speed to avoid government intervention, stating later that &quot;when you get money from someone that always comes with strings. They want to see how we are going to progress, what type of moves you are going to do. They want reports. And also, I wanted to keep Pfizer out of politics, by the way.&quot;

In May 2020, Pfizer began testing four different COVID-19 vaccine variations using lipid nanoparticle technology provided by Canadian biotechnology company Acuitas Therapeutics. Vaccines were injected into the first human participants in the U.S. in early May. In July 2020, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that two of the partners&#x27; four mRNA vaccine candidates had won fast track designation from the FDA. The company began PhaseII-III testing on 30,000 people in the last week of July 2020 and was slated to be paid $1.95billion for 100million doses of the vaccine by the US government. In September 2020, Pfizer and BioNTech announced that they had completed talks with the European Commission to provide an initial 200million vaccine doses to the EU, with the option to supply another 100million doses at a later date.

On November 9, 2020, Pfizer announced that BioNTech&#x27;s COVID-19 vaccine, tested on 43,500 people, was found to be 90% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19. The efficacy was updated to 95% a week later. Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist interviewed by &quot;The New York Times&quot;, described the efficacy figure as &quot;really a spectacular number.&quot; The announcement made Pfizer and BioNTech the first companies to develop and test a working vaccine for COVID-19.

Over the following month and a half, regulators in various countries approved Pfizer&#x27;s vaccine for emergency use.

==== Controversy ====
In February 2021, after a year long investigation relying on unnamed officials, Pfizer was accused by The Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ) of employing &quot;high-level bullying&quot; against at least two Latin American countries during negotiations to acquire COVID-19 vaccines, including requesting that the countries put sovereign assets as collateral for payments. According to TBIJ, these negotiation tactics resulted in a months long delay in Pfizer reaching a vaccine agreement with one country and a complete failure to reach agreements with two other countries, including Argentina and Brazil.

In November 2021, TBMJ published an article after obtaining information from a whistleblower from the Ventavia Research Group. Ventavia was hired by Pfizer as a research subcontractor. A regional director (whistleblower) who was employed at Ventavia Research Group has told &quot;The BMJ&quot; that the company falsified data, unblinded patients, employed inadequately trained vaccinators, and was slow to follow up on adverse events reported in Pfizer&#x27;s pivotal phase III trial. The regional director, Brook Jackson, emailed a complaint to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Ventavia fired her later the same day. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) stated in a response to the European Parliament, that &quot;the deficiencies identified do not jeopardize the quality and integrity of the data from the main Comirnaty trial and have no impact on the benefit-risk assessment or on the conclusions on the safety, effectiveness and quality of the vaccine&quot;. &quot;Science-Based Medicine&quot; emphasized that Ventavia oversaw just three of the 153 clinical sites involved with Pfizer&#x27;s trial and &quot;a small fraction (~1,000 by the time the whistleblower was fired) of the trial&#x27;s over ~44,000 subjects.&quot;

On 10 October 2022, during a session of the European Parliament&#x27;s Special Committee on the COVID-19 Pandemic, Pfizer executive Janine Small testified that the company had not evaluated their COVID-19 vaccine for its ability to reduce transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus prior to its release to the general public. Dutch MEP Rob Roos described the admission as &quot;scandalous&quot;. CEO Albert Bourla was slated to attend, but withdrew. Roos&#x27; statements in turn have been described as &quot;misleading&quot;.

==== Development of oral antivirals ====
In November 2021, Pfizer launched a new COVID-19 oral antivirus treatment known as Paxlovid. In January 2022, the Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla confirmed that the trial results of a fourth dose were pending until March 2022. He said that the firm was setting up a collaboration to develop an anti-COVID pill treatment along with a French company, Novasep. He also said the COVID vaccine was &quot;safe and efficient&quot; for children. In May 2022, reports emerged of patients experiencing &quot;rebound&quot; symptoms after completing a five-day course of Paxlovid. The FDA responded by announcing they had performed additional analyses of the drug&#x27;s clinical trial data, and decided against changing its recommendations. U.S. President Joe Biden and Dr. Anthony Fauci were both reported to experience this rebound syndrome in the months that followed, while continuing to recommend the drug for those who may benefit from it.

===Late 2020–onwards: Corporate developments and acquisitions ===
In September 2020, the company acquired a 9.9% stake in CStone Pharmaceuticals for $200million (HK$1.55billion), helping to commercialise its anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, CS1001. In October 2020, the company acquired Arixa Pharmaceuticals. In November 2020, using a Reverse Morris Trust structure, Pfizer merged its off-patent branded and generic drug business, known as Upjohn, with Mylan to form Viatris, owned 57% by Pfizer shareholders.

On January 5, 2021, Pfizer introduced a new logo. In April 2021, Pfizer acquired Amplyx Pharmaceuticals and its anti-fungal compound fosmanogepix (APX001). In August, the company announced it would acquire Trillium Therapeutics Inc and its immuno-oncology portfolio for $2.3 billion.

In March 2022, the company acquired Arena Pharmaceuticals for $6.7 billion in cash. In June 2022, the company acquired ReViral Ltd, for up to $525 million, gaining access to experimental drugs used to combat respiratory syncytial virus infections. In October 2022, the company acquired Biohaven Pharma and its calcitonin gene-related peptide programs for $11.6 billion. It also acquired Global Blood Therapeutics for $5.4 billion, boosting Pfizer&#x27;s rare disease business.

In April 2023, Pfizer moved its world headquarters from 42nd Street in Midtown Manhattan to the Spiral at Hudson Yards.

In December 2023, the company acquired Seagen, a pioneer of antibody–drug conjugates for the treatment of cancer, for $43billion.

On Sept 30, 2024, Pfizer announced its intentions to sell 540 million Haleon shares whose worth is about  £2.1 billion ($2.8 billion)  according to Bloomberg calculations.

==Legal issues==
===Aggressive pharmaceutical marketing===

Pfizer has been accused of aggressive pharmaceutical marketing.

====2004 Illegal marketing of gabapentin for off-label uses settlement====
In 1993, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved gabapentin only for treatment of seizures. Warner–Lambert, which merged with Pfizer in 2000, used continuing medical education and medical research, sponsored articles about the drug for the medical literature, and alleged suppression of unfavorable study results, to promote gabapentin. Within five years, the drug was being widely used for off-label uses such as treatment of pain and psychiatric conditions. Warner–Lambert admitted to violating FDA regulations by promoting the drug for pain, psychiatric conditions, migraine, and other unapproved uses. In 2004, the company paid $430million in one of the largest settlements to resolve criminal and civil health care liability charges. It was the first off-label promotion case successfully brought under the False Claims Act. A Cochrane review concluded that gabapentin is ineffective in migraine prophylaxis. The American Academy of Neurology rates it as having unproven efficacy, while the Canadian Headache Society and the European Federation of Neurological Societies rate its use as being supported by moderate and low-quality evidence.

====2009 Illegal marketing of Bextra settlement====
In September 2009, Pfizer pleaded guilty to the illegal marketing of arthritis drug valdecoxib (Bextra) and agreed to a $2.3billion settlement, the largest health care fraud settlement at that time. Pfizer promoted the sale of the drug for several uses and dosages that the Food and Drug Administration specifically declined to approve due to safety concerns. The drug was pulled from the market in 2005. It was Pfizer&#x27;s fourth such settlement in a decade. The payment included $1.195billion in criminal penalties for felony violations of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, and $1.0billion to settle allegations it had illegally promoted the drugs for uses that were not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) leading to violations under the False Claims Act as reimbursements were requested from Federal and State programs. The criminal fine was the largest ever assessed in the United States to date. Pfizer entered a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General that required it to make substantial structural reforms within the company, and publish to its website its post approval commitments and a searchable database of all payments to physicians made by the company.

====Termination of Peter Rost====
Peter Rost was vice president in charge of the endocrinology division at Pharmacia before its acquisition by Pfizer. During that time he raised concerns internally about kickbacks and off-label marketing of Genotropin, Pharmacia&#x27;s human growth hormone drug. Pfizer reported the Pharmacia marketing practices to the FDA and Department of Justice; Rost was unaware of this and filed an FCA lawsuit against Pfizer. Pfizer kept him employed, but isolated him until the FCA suit was unsealed in 2005. The Justice Department declined to intervene, and Pfizer fired him, and he filed a wrongful termination suit against Pfizer. Pfizer won a summary dismissal of the case, with the court ruling that the evidence showed Pfizer had decided to fire Rost prior to learning of his whistleblower activities.

====2014 Illegal marketing of Rapamune settlement====
A &quot;whistleblower suit&quot; was filed in 2005 against Wyeth, which was acquired by Pfizer in 2009, alleging that the company illegally marketed sirolimus (Rapamune) for off-label uses, targeted specific doctors and medical facilities to increase sales of Rapamune, tried to get transplant patients to change from their transplant drugs to Rapamune, and specifically targeted African-Americans. According to the whistleblowers, Wyeth also provided doctors and hospitals that prescribed the drug with kickbacks such as grants, donations, and other money. In 2013, the company pleaded guilty to criminal mis-branding violations under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. By August 2014, it had paid $491million in civil and criminal penalties related to Rapamune.

====2014 Illegal marketing settlement====
In June 2010, health insurance network Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) filed a lawsuit against Pfizer for allegedly illegally marketing drugs Bextra, Geodon and Lyrica. BCBS alleged that Pfizer used kickbacks and wrongly persuaded doctors to prescribe the drugs. According to the lawsuit, Pfizer handed out &#x27;misleading&#x27; materials on off-label uses, sent over 5,000 doctors on trips to the Caribbean or around the United States, and paid them $2,000 honoraria in return for listening to lectures about Bextra. Despite Pfizer&#x27;s claims that &quot;the company&#x27;s intent was pure&quot; in fostering a legal exchange of information among doctors, an internal marketing plan revealed that Pfizer intended to train physicians &quot;to serve as public relations spokespeople.&quot; The case was settled in 2014 for $325million. Fearing that Pfizer is &quot;too big to fail&quot; and that prosecuting the company would result in disruptions to Medicare and Medicaid, federal prosecutors instead charged a subsidiary of a subsidiary of a subsidiary of Pfizer, which is &quot;nothing more than a shell company whose only function is to plead guilty.&quot;

===2013 Quigley Company asbestos settlement===
The Quigley Company, which sold asbestos-containing insulation products until the early 1970s, was acquired by Pfizer in 1968. In June 2013, asbestos victims and Pfizer negotiated a settlement that required Pfizer to pay a total of $964million: $430million to 80% of existing plaintiffs and place an additional $535million into a settlement trust that will compensate future plaintiffs as well as the remaining 20% of plaintiffs with claims against Pfizer and Quigley. Of that $535million, $405million is in a 40-year note from Pfizer, while $100million is from insurance policies.

===1994 Shiley defective heart valves settlement===
Pfizer purchased Shiley in 1979, at the onset of its Convexo-Concave valve ordeal, involving the Bjork–Shiley valve. Approximately 500 people died when defective heart valves fractured and, in 1994, Pfizer agreed to pay $10.75million to settle claims by the United States Department of Justice that the company lied to get approval for the valves.

===2010 Firing of employee that filed suit===
A federal lawsuit was filed by a scientist claiming she got an infection by a genetically modified lentivirus while working for Pfizer, resulting in intermittent paralysis. A judge dismissed the case citing a lack of evidence that the illness was caused by the virus but the jury ruled that by firing the employee, Pfizer violated laws protecting freedom of speech and whistleblowers and awarded her $1.37million.

===2012 Celebrex intellectual property settlement===
Brigham Young University (BYU) said a professor of chemistry, Dr. Daniel L. Simmons, discovered an enzyme in the 1990s that led towards development of Celebrex. BYU was originally seeking a 15% royalty on sales, equating to $9.7billion. A research agreement had been made between BYU and Monsanto, whose pharmaceutical business was later acquired by Pfizer, to develop a better aspirin. The enzyme Dr. Simmons claims to have discovered would induce pain and inflammation while causing gastrointestinal problems and Celebrex is used to reduce those issues. A six-year battle ensued because BYU claimed that Pfizer did not give Dr. Simmons credit or compensation, while Pfizer claimed that it had met all obligations regarding the Monsanto agreement. In May 2012, Pfizer settled the allegations, agreeing to pay $450million.

===2011 Nigeria Trovafloxacin lawsuit settlement===

In 1996, an outbreak of measles, cholera, and bacterial meningitis occurred in Nigeria. Pfizer representatives and personnel from a contract research organization (CRO) traveled to Kano to set up a clinical trial and administer an experimental antibiotic, trovafloxacin, to approximately 200 children. Tests in animals showed that Trovan had life-threatening side effects, including joint disease, abnormal cartilage growth, liver damage, and a degenerative bone condition. Pfizer’s representatives did not alert the parents or patients about the serious risks involved, or tell them about an effective conventional treatment that Doctors without Borders was providing at the same site. Local Kano officials reported that more than fifty children died in the experiment, while many others developed mental and physical deformities such as blindness, deafness, paralysis, and brain damage. The nature and frequency of both fatalities and other adverse outcomes were similar to those historically found among pediatric patients treated for meningitis in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2001, families of the children, as well as the governments of Kano and Nigeria, filed lawsuits regarding the treatment. According to &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;, &quot;[r]esearchers did not obtain signed consent forms, and medical personnel said Pfizer did not tell parents their children were getting the experimental drug.&quot; The lawsuits also accused Pfizer of using the outbreak to perform unapproved human testing, as well as allegedly under-dosing a control group being treated with traditional antibiotics in order to skew the results of the trial in favor of Trovan. Nigerian medical personnel as well as at least one Pfizer physician said the trial was conducted without regulatory approval.

In 2007, Pfizer published a Statement of Defense letter, stating that the drug&#x27;s oral form was safer and easier to administer. Trovan had been used safely in more than five thousand Americans prior to the Nigerian trial, and mortality in the patients treated by Pfizer was lower than that observed historically in African meningitis epidemics. No unusual side effects, unrelated to meningitis, were observed after four weeks.

In June 2010, the US Supreme Court rejected Pfizer&#x27;s appeal against a ruling allowing lawsuits by the Nigerian families to proceed.

In December 2010, the United States diplomatic cables leak indicated that Pfizer hired investigators to find evidence of corruption against Nigerian attorney general Michael Aondoakaa to persuade him to drop legal action. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reporter Joe Stephens, who helped break the story in 2000, called these actions &quot;dangerously close to blackmail&quot;. In response, the company released a press statement describing the allegations as &quot;preposterous&quot; and saying that it acted in good faith. Aondoakka, who had allegedly demanded bribes from Pfizer in return for a settlement of the case, was declared unfit for office and had his U.S. visa revoked in association with corruption charges in 2010.

The lawsuits were eventually settled out of court. Pfizer committed to paying &quot;to compensate the families of children in the study&quot;, another $30 million to &quot;support healthcare initiatives in Kano&quot;, and $10 million to cover legal costs. Payouts began in 2011.

===2022 Inflating Prices fine===
In July 2022, UK antitrust authorities fined Pfizer £63 million for unfairly high priced drug that aids in controlling epileptic seizures. The Competition and Markets Authority stated that the company took advantage of loopholes by de-branding epilepsy drug Epanutin, by doing so the price of Epanutin&#x27;s price was not regulated to the same standards the company are used to and therefore the price of the drug was raised. It was stated that over a four-year period, Pfizer had billed Epanutin for around 780% and 1,600% higher than its standard price.

===2022 Allegations of patent infringement on mRNA technology===

In August 2022, Moderna announced that it will sue Pfizer and its partner BioNTech for infringing their patent on the mRNA technology. In May 2024, the European Patent Office upheld the validity of Moderna&#x27;s EP949 patent, one of the two patents asserted against Pfizer and BioNTech.

==Environmental record==
Since 2000, the company has implemented more than 4,000 greenhouse gas reduction projects.

Pfizer has inherited Wyeth&#x27;s liabilities in the American Cyanamid site in Bridgewater Township, New Jersey, a highly toxic EPA Superfund site. Pfizer has since attempted to remediate this land in order to clean and develop it for future profits and potential public uses. The Sierra Club and the Edison Wetlands Association have opposed the cleanup plan, arguing that the area is subject to flooding, which could cause pollutants to leach. The EPA considers the plan the most reasonable from considerations of safety and cost-effectiveness, arguing that an alternative plan involving trucking contaminated soil off site could expose cleanup workers. The EPA&#x27;s position is backed by the environmental watchdog group CRISIS.

In June 2002, a chemical explosion at the Groton plant injured 7 people and caused the evacuation of more than 100 homes in the surrounding area.

<text>Forgery is a white-collar crime that generally consists of the false making or material alteration of a legal instrument with the specific intent to . Tampering with a certain legal instrument may be forbidden by law in some jurisdictions but such an offense is not related to forgery unless the tampered legal instrument was actually used in the course of the crime to defraud another person or entity. Copies, studio replicas, and reproductions are not considered forgeries, though they may later become forgeries through knowing and willful misrepresentations.

Forging money or currency is more often called counterfeiting. But consumer goods may also be &quot;counterfeits&quot; if they are not manufactured or produced by the designated manufacturer or producer given on the label or flagged by the trademark symbol. When the object forged is a record or document it is often called a false document.

This usage of &quot;forgery&quot; does not derive from metalwork done at a blacksmith&#x27;s forge, but it has a parallel history. A sense of &quot;to counterfeit&quot; is already in the Anglo-French verb &quot;forger&quot;, meaning &quot;falsify&quot;.

A forgery is essentially concerned with a produced or altered object. Where the prime concern of a forgery is less focused on the object itself – what it is worth or what it &quot;proves&quot; – than on a tacit statement of criticism that is revealed by the reactions the object provokes in others, then the larger process is a hoax. In a hoax, a rumor or a genuine object planted in a concocted situation, may substitute for a forged physical object.

The similar crime of fraud is the crime of deceiving another, including through the use of objects obtained through forgery. Forgery is one of the techniques of fraud, including identity theft. Forgery is one of the threats addressed by security engineering.

In the 16th century, imitators of Albrecht Dürer&#x27;s style of printmaking improved the market for their own prints by signing them &quot;AD&quot;, making them forgeries. In the 20th century the art market made forgeries highly profitable. There are widespread forgeries of especially valued artists, such as drawings originally by Pablo Picasso, Paul Klee, and Henri Matisse.

A special case of double forgery is the forging of Vermeer&#x27;s paintings by Han van Meegeren, and in its turn the forging of Van Meegeren&#x27;s work by his son Jacques van Meegeren.

==Criminal law==

===England and Wales and Northern Ireland===
In England and Wales and Northern Ireland, forgery is an offence under section 1 of the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981, which provides:

&quot;Instrument&quot; is defined by section 8, &quot;makes&quot; and &quot;false&quot; by section 9, and &quot;induce&quot; and &quot;prejudice&quot; by section 10.

Forgery is triable either way. A person guilty of forgery is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, or, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine not exceeding the statutory maximum, or to both.

For offences akin to forgery, see English criminal law#Forgery, personation, and cheating.

The common law offence of forgery is abolished for all purposes not relating to offences committed before the commencement of the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981.

===Scotland===
Forgery is not an official offence under the law of Scotland, except in cases where statute provides otherwise.

The Forgery of Foreign Bills Act 1803 was repealed in 2013.

===Republic of Ireland===
In the Republic of Ireland, forgery is an offence under section 25(1) of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 which provides:

A person guilty of forgery is liable, on conviction on indictment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years, or to a fine, or to both.

Any offence at common law of forgery is abolished. The abolition of a common law offence of forgery does not affect proceedings for any such offence committed before its abolition.

Except as regards offences committed before the commencement of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 and except where the context otherwise requires, without prejudice to section 65(4)(a) of that Act, references to forgery must be construed in accordance with the provisions of that Act.

===Canada===
Forgery is an offence under sections 366, 367 and 368 of the Canadian Criminal Code. The offence is a hybrid offence, subject to a maximum prison sentence of:
* if tried summarily: 6 months
* if tried on indictment: 10 years

===United States===

Forgery is a crime in all jurisdictions within the United States, both state and federal. Most states, including California, describe forgery as occurring when a person alters a written document &quot;with the intent to defraud, knowing that he or she has no authority to do so.&quot; The written document usually has to be an instrument of legal significance. Punishments for forgery vary widely. In California, forgery for an amount under $950 can result in misdemeanor charges and no jail time, while a forgery involving a loss of over $500,000 can result in three years in prison for the forgery plus a five-year &quot;conduct enhancement&quot; for the amount of the loss, yielding eight years in prison. In Connecticut, forgery in the Third Degree, which is a class B misdemeanor is punishable by up to 6 months in jail, a $1000 fine, and probation; forgery in the First Degree, which is a class C felony, is punishable by a maximum 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $10,000 fine, or both.

==Civil law==
As to the effect, in the United Kingdom, of a forged signature on a bill of exchange, see section 24 of the Bills of Exchange Act 1882.

==In popular culture==
* The 1839 novel by Honoré de Balzac, &quot;Pierre Grassou&quot;, concerns an artist who lives off forgeries.
* Alexander Howland Smith was a prominent forger in the 1880&#x27;s, including of the writings of Robert Burns&#x27; Scottish poetry.
* The Orson Welles documentary &quot;F for Fake&quot; concerns both art and literary forgery. For the movie, Welles intercut footage of Elmyr de Hory, an art forger, and Clifford Irving, who wrote an &quot;authorized&quot; autobiography of Howard Hughes that had been revealed to be a hoax. While forgery is the ostensible subject of the film, it also concerns art, film making, storytelling and the creative process.
* The 1966 heist comedy film &quot;How to Steal a Million&quot; centers around Nicole Bonnet (Audrey Hepburn) attempting to steal a fake Cellini made by her grandfather.
* The 1964 children&#x27;s book &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; written by Roald Dahl revealed the &quot;golden ticket&quot; in Japan was a forgery.
* The 1972 novel by Irving Wallace, &quot;The Word&quot; concerns archaeological forgery, the finding and translation of a supposed lost gospel by James the Just, close relative of Jesus Christ, as part of a large project to be published as a new Bible that would inspire a Christian revival, but which is possibly a forged document.
* The 2002 film &quot;Catch Me If You Can&quot;, directed by Steven Spielberg, is based on the claims of Frank Abagnale, a con man who allegedly stole over US$2.5 million through forgery, imposture and other frauds, which are dramatized in the film. His career in crime lasted six years from 1963 to 1969. The veracity of most of Abagnale&#x27;s claims has been questioned.
* The graphic art novel &quot;The Last Coiner&quot;, authored by Peter M. Kershaw, is based on the exploits of the 18th century English counterfeiters, the Cragg Vale Coiners, who were sentenced to execution by hanging at Tyburn.

<text>Pharmacia was a pharmaceutical and biotechnological company in Sweden that merged with the American pharmaceutical company Upjohn in 1995.

==History ==
Pharmacia company was founded in 1911 in Stockholm, Sweden by pharmacist Gustav Felix Grönfeldt at the &quot;Elgen&quot; Pharmacy. The company was named after the Greek word φαρμακεία, transliterated &quot;pharmakeia&quot;, which means &#x27;sorcery&#x27;. In the company&#x27;s early days, much of its profits were derived from the &quot;miracle medicine&quot; Phospho-Energon.

During World War II, Swedish chemist Björn Ingelman (who worked for Arne Tiselius at Uppsala university) researched various uses for the polysaccharide dextran. Together with the medical researcher Anders Grönwall, he discovered that dextran could be used as a replacement for blood plasma in blood transfusions, for which there could be a large need in wartime. Pharmacia, which then was still a small company, was contacted in 1943 and its CEO Elis Göth was very interested. The product Macrodex, a dextran solution, was launched four years later.

Dextran-based products were to play a significant role in the further expansion of Pharmacia. In 1951, the company moved to Uppsala, Sweden, to get closer to the scientists with whom they cooperated, and Ingelman became its head of research. In 1959, Pharmacia pioneered gel filtration with its Sephadex products. These were also based on dextran and discoveries in Tiselius&#x27; department, this time by Jerker Porath and Per Flodin. In 1967 Pharmacia Fine Chemicals was established in Uppsala. In 1986 Pharmacia Fine Chemicals acquired LKB-produkter AB and changed its name to Pharmacia Biotech. Pharmacia Biotech expanded their role in the &quot;biotech revolution&quot; through its acquisition of PL Laboratories from Pabst Brewery offering a line of recombinant DNA specialty research chemicals. Sold to private interests in the 1990s, Pharmacia was first merged with &quot;Kabi Vitrum&quot; to form Kabi Pharmacia with headquarters in Uppsala. In 1993, Kabi Pharmacia bought Farmitalia, an Italian company that had developed doxorubicin, a chemotherapeutic.

In 1995 the company merged with the American pharmaceutical company Upjohn, becoming known as Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn and moved its headquarters to London.

In 1998, the company was divided into two business area. The pharmaceutical business became Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn. The scientific instruments groups which sold chromatography resin, purification equipment, molecular biology reagents and electrophoresis products was purchased by Amersham in 1998 and was named Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. They later changed the name to Amersham Biosciences and ran their radiochemical and reagents business along with the highly profitable chromatography business. The Pharmacia Logo Drop remained as a highly recognized brand. Amersham Biosciences was sold to GE Healthcare in 2004 to become GE Healthcare Life Sciences. From 1 April 2020, GE Healthcare Life Sciences has been renamed Cytiva, following the sale of GE Healthcare Life Sciences from General Electric to Danaher Corporation in a $21.4 billion acquisition.

<doc id="62317" wikidata="Q930667" url="?curid=62317" title="Speex">
<text>Speex is an audio compression codec specifically tuned for the reproduction of human speech and also a free software speech codec that may be used on voice over IP applications and podcasts. It is based on the code excited linear prediction speech coding algorithm. Its creators claim Speex to be free of any patent restrictions and it is licensed under the revised (3-clause) BSD license. It may be used with the Ogg container format or directly transmitted over UDP/RTP. It may also be used with the FLV container format.

The Speex designers see their project as complementary to the Vorbis general-purpose audio compression project.

Speex is a lossy format, &quot;i.e.&quot; quality is permanently degraded to reduce file size.

The Speex project was created on February 13, 2002. The first development versions of Speex were released under LGPL license, but as of version 1.0 beta 1, Speex is released under Xiph&#x27;s version of the (revised) BSD license. Speex 1.0 was announced on March 24, 2003, after a year of development. The last stable version of Speex encoder and decoder is 1.2.1.

Xiph.Org now considers Speex obsolete; its successor is the more modern Opus codec, which uses the SILK format under license from Microsoft and surpasses its performance in most areas except at the lowest sample rates.

== Description ==
Speex is targeted at voice over IP (VoIP) and file-based compression. The design goals have been to make a codec that would be optimized for high quality speech and low bit rate. To achieve this the codec uses multiple bit rates, and supports ultra-wideband (32 kHz sampling rate), wideband (16 kHz sampling rate) and narrowband (telephone quality, 8 kHz sampling rate). Since Speex was designed for VoIP instead of cell phone use, the codec must be robust to lost packets, but not to corrupted ones. All this led to the choice of code excited linear prediction (CELP) as the encoding technique to use for Speex. One of the main reasons is that CELP has long proven that it could do the job and scale well to both low bit rates (as evidenced by DoD CELP @ 4.8 kbit/s) and high bit rates (as with G.728 @ 16 kbit/s).
The main characteristics can be summarized as follows:
* Free software/open-source, patent and royalty-free.
* Integration of narrowband and wideband in the same bit-stream.
* Wide range of bit rates available (from 2 kbit/s to 44 kbit/s).
* Dynamic bit rate switching and variable bit-rate (VBR).
* Voice activity detection (VAD, integrated with VBR) (not working from version 1.2).
* Variable complexity.
* Ultra-wideband mode at 32 kHz (up to 48 kHz).
* Intensity stereo encoding option.

===Features===
;Sampling rate: Speex is mainly designed for three different sampling rates: 8 kHz (the same sampling rate to transmit telephone calls), 16 kHz, and 32 kHz. These are respectively referred to as narrowband, wideband and ultra-wideband.
;Quality: Speex encoding is controlled most of the time by a quality parameter that ranges from 0 to 10. In constant bit-rate (CBR) operation, the quality parameter is an integer, while for variable bit-rate (VBR), the parameter is a real (floating point) number.
;Complexity (variable): With Speex, it is possible to vary the complexity allowed for the encoder. This is done by controlling how the search is performed with an integer ranging from 1 to 10 in a way similar to the -1 to -9 options to gzip compression utilities. For normal use, the noise level at complexity 1 is between 1 and 2 dB higher than at complexity 10, but the CPU requirements for complexity 10 is about five times higher than for complexity 1. In practice, the best trade-off is between complexity 2 and 4, though higher settings are often useful when encoding non-speech sounds like DTMF tones, or if encoding is not in real-time.
;Variable bit-rate (VBR): Variable bit-rate (VBR) allows a codec to change its bit rate dynamically to adapt to the &quot;difficulty&quot; of the audio being encoded. In the example of Speex, sounds like vowels and high-energy transients require a higher bit rate to achieve good quality, while fricatives (e.g. s and f sounds) can be coded adequately with fewer bits. For this reason, VBR can achieve lower bit rate for the same quality, or a better quality for a certain bit rate. Despite its advantages, VBR has three main drawbacks: first, by only specifying quality, there is no guarantee about the final average bit-rate. Second, for some real-time applications like voice over IP (VoIP), what counts is the maximum bit-rate, which must be low enough for the communication channel. Third, encryption of VBR-encoded speech may not ensure complete privacy, as phrases can still be identified, at least in a controlled setting with a small dictionary of phrases, by analysing the pattern of variation of the bit rate.
;Average bit-rate (ABR): Average bit-rate solves one of the problems of VBR, as it dynamically adjusts VBR quality in order to meet a specific target bit-rate. Because the quality/bit-rate is adjusted in real-time (open-loop), the global quality will be slightly lower than that obtained by encoding in VBR with exactly the right quality setting to meet the target average bitrate.
;Voice Activity Detection (VAD): When enabled, voice activity detection detects whether the audio being encoded is speech or silence/background noise. VAD is always implicitly activated when encoding in VBR, so the option is only useful in non-VBR operation. In this case, Speex detects non-speech periods and encodes them with just enough bits to reproduce the background noise. This is called &quot;comfort noise generation&quot; (CNG). Last version VAD was working fine is 1.1.12, since v 1.2 it has been replaced with simple Any Activity Detection.
;Discontinuous transmission (DTX): Discontinuous transmission is an addition to VAD/VBR operation which allows ceasing transmitting completely when the background noise is stationary. In a file, 5 bits are used for each missing frame (corresponding to 250 bit/s).
;Perceptual enhancement: Perceptual enhancement is a part of the decoder which, when turned on, tries to reduce (the perception of) the noise produced by the coding/decoding process. In most cases, perceptual enhancement makes the sound further from the original objectively (signal-to-noise ratio), but in the end it still sounds better (subjective improvement).
;Algorithmic delay: Every codec introduces a delay in the transmission. For Speex, this delay is equal to the frame size, plus some amount of &quot;look-ahead&quot; required to process each frame. In narrowband operation (8 kHz), the delay is 30 ms, while for wideband (16 kHz), the delay is 34 ms. These values do not account for the CPU time it takes to encode or decode the frames.

==Applications==
There are a large base of applications supporting the Speex codec. Examples include:
* Streaming applications like teleconference (e.g. TeamSpeak, Mumble)
* VoIP systems (e.g. Asterisk)
* Videogames (e.g. Xbox Live, &quot;Civilization 4&quot;, &quot;DropMix&quot; vocal tracks, ...) 
* Audio processing applications.

Most of these are based on the DirectShow filter or OpenACM codec (e.g. Microsoft NetMeeting) on Microsoft Windows, or Xiph.org&#x27;s reference implementation, libvorbis, on Linux (e.g. Ekiga). There are also plugins for many audio players. See the plugin and software page on the speex.org site for more details.

The media type for Speex is audio/ogg while contained by Ogg, and audio/speex (previously audio/x-speex) when transported through RTP or without container.

The United States Army&#x27;s Land Warrior system, designed by General Dynamics, also uses Speex for VoIP on an EPLRS radio designed by Raytheon.

The Ear Bible is a single-ear headphone with a built-in Speex player with 1 GB of flash memory, preloaded with a recording of the New American Standard Bible.

ASL Safety &amp; Security&#x27;s Linux based VIPA OS software which is used in long line public address systems and voice alarm systems at major international air transport hubs and rail networks.

The Rockbox project uses Speex for its voice interface. It can also play Speex files on supported players, such as the Apple iPod or the iRiver H10.

The Vernier LabQuest handheld data acquisition device for science education uses Speex for voice annotations created by students and teachers using either the built-in or an external microphone.

The Google Mobile App for iPhone currently incorporates Speex. It has also been suggested that the new Google voice search iPhone app is using Speex to transmit voice to Google servers for interpretation.

Adobe Flash Player supports Speex starting with Flash Player 10.0.12.36, released in October 2008. Because of some bugs in Flash Player, the first recommended version for Speex support is 10.0.22.87 and later. Speex in Flash Player can be used for both kind of communication, through Flash Media Server or P2P. Speex can be decoded or converted to any format unlike Nellymoser audio, which was the only speech format in previous versions of Flash Player. Speex can be also used in the Flash Video container format (.flv), starting with version 10 of Video File Format Specification (published in November 2008).

The JavaSonics ListenUp voice recorder uses Speex to compress voice messages that are recorded in a browser and then uploaded to a web server. Primary applications are language training, transcription and social networking.

Speex is used as the voice compression algorithm in the Siri voice assistance on the iPhone 4S. Since text-to-speech occurs on Apple&#x27;s servers, the Speex codec is used to minimize network bandwidth.

<text>In programming languages, a closure, also lexical closure or function closure, is a technique for implementing lexically scoped name binding in a language with first-class functions. Operationally, a closure is a record storing a function together with an environment. The environment is a mapping associating each free variable of the function (variables that are used locally, but defined in an enclosing scope) with the value or reference to which the name was bound when the closure was created. Unlike a plain function, a closure allows the function to access those &quot;captured variables&quot; through the closure&#x27;s copies of their values or references, even when the function is invoked outside their scope.

== History and etymology ==
The concept of closures was developed in the 1960s for the mechanical evaluation of expressions in the λ-calculus and was first fully implemented in 1970 as a language feature in the PAL programming language to support lexically scoped first-class functions.

Peter Landin defined the term &quot;closure&quot; in 1964 as having an &quot;environment part&quot; and a &quot;control part&quot; as used by his SECD machine for evaluating expressions. Joel Moses credits Landin with introducing the term &quot;closure&quot; to refer to a lambda expression with open bindings (free variables) that have been closed by (or bound in) the lexical environment, resulting in a &quot;closed expression&quot;, or closure. This use was subsequently adopted by Sussman and Steele when they defined Scheme in 1975, a lexically scoped variant of Lisp, and became widespread.

Sussman and Abelson also use the term &quot;closure&quot; in the 1980s with a second, unrelated meaning: the property of an operator that adds data to a data structure to also be able to add nested data structures. This use of the term comes from mathematics use, rather than the prior use in computer science. The authors consider this overlap in terminology to be &quot;unfortunate.&quot;

== Anonymous functions ==

The term &quot;closure&quot; is often used as a synonym for anonymous function, though strictly, an anonymous function is a function literal without a name, while a closure is an instance of a function, a value, whose non-local variables have been bound either to values or to storage locations (depending on the language; see the lexical environment section below).

For example, in the following Python code:

def f(x):
 def g(y):
 return x + y
 return g # Return a closure.

def h(x):
 return lambda y: x + y # Return a closure.

# Assigning specific closures to variables.
a = f(1)
b = h(1)

# Using the closures stored in variables.
assert a(5) == 6
assert b(5) == 6

# Using closures without binding them to variables first.
assert f(1)(5) == 6 # f(1) is the closure.
assert h(1)(5) == 6 # h(1) is the closure.

the values of codice_1 and codice_2 are closures, in both cases produced by returning a nested function with a free variable from the enclosing function, so that the free variable binds to the value of parameter codice_3 of the enclosing function. The closures in codice_1 and codice_2 are functionally identical. The only difference in implementation is that in the first case we used a nested function with a name, codice_6, while in the second case we used an anonymous nested function (using the Python keyword codice_7 for creating an anonymous function). The original name, if any, used in defining them is irrelevant.

A closure is a value like any other value. It does not need to be assigned to a variable and can instead be used directly, as shown in the last two lines of the example. This usage may be deemed an &quot;anonymous closure&quot;.

The nested function definitions are not themselves closures: they have a free variable which is not yet bound. Only once the enclosing function is evaluated with a value for the parameter is the free variable of the nested function bound, creating a closure, which is then returned from the enclosing function.

Lastly, a closure is only distinct from a function with free variables when outside of the scope of the non-local variables, otherwise the defining environment and the execution environment coincide and there is nothing to distinguish these (static and dynamic binding cannot be distinguished because the names resolve to the same values). For example, in the program below, functions with a free variable codice_3 (bound to the non-local variable codice_3 with global scope) are executed in the same environment where codice_3 is defined, so it is immaterial whether these are actually closures:

x = 1
nums = [1, 2, 3]

def f(y):
 return x + y

map(f, nums)
map(lambda y: x + y, nums)

This is most often achieved by a function return, since the function must be defined within the scope of the non-local variables, in which case typically its own scope will be smaller.

This can also be achieved by variable shadowing (which reduces the scope of the non-local variable), though this is less common in practice, as it is less useful and shadowing is discouraged. In this example codice_11 can be seen to be a closure because codice_3 in the body of codice_11 is bound to the codice_3 in the global namespace, not the codice_3 local to codice_6:

x = 0

def f(y):
 return x + y

def g(z):
 x = 1 # local x shadows global x
 return f(z)

g(1) # evaluates to 1, not 2
== Applications ==
The use of closures is associated with languages where functions are first-class objects, in which functions can be returned as results from higher-order functions, or passed as arguments to other function calls; if functions with free variables are first-class, then returning one creates a closure. This includes functional programming languages such as Lisp and ML, and many modern, multi-paradigm languages, such as Julia, Python, and Rust. Closures are also often used with callbacks, particularly for event handlers, such as in JavaScript, where they are used for interactions with a dynamic web page.

Closures can also be used in a continuation-passing style to hide state. Constructs such as objects and control structures can thus be implemented with closures. In some languages, a closure may occur when a function is defined within another function, and the inner function refers to local variables of the outer function. At run-time, when the outer function executes, a closure is formed, consisting of the inner function&#x27;s code and references (the upvalues) to any variables of the outer function required by the closure.

=== First-class functions ===

Closures typically appear in languages with first-class functions—in other words, such languages enable functions to be passed as arguments, returned from function calls, bound to variable names, etc., just like simpler types such as strings and integers. For example, consider the following Scheme function:

; Return a list of all books with at least THRESHOLD copies sold.
(define (best-selling-books threshold)
 (filter
 (lambda (book)
 (&gt;= (book-sales book) threshold))
 book-list))
In this example, the lambda expression codice_17 appears within the function codice_18. When the lambda expression is evaluated, Scheme creates a closure consisting of the code for the lambda expression and a reference to the codice_19 variable, which is a free variable inside the lambda expression.

The closure is then passed to the codice_20 function, which calls it repeatedly to determine which books are to be added to the result list and which are to be discarded. Because the closure has a reference to codice_19, it can use that variable each time codice_20 calls it. The function codice_20 might be defined in a separate file.

Here is the same example rewritten in JavaScript, another popular language with support for closures:

// Return a list of all books with at least &#x27;threshold&#x27; copies sold.
function bestSellingBooks(threshold) {
 return bookList.filter(book =&gt; book.sales &gt;= threshold);


The arrow operator codice_24 is used to define an arrow function expression, and an codice_25 method instead of a global codice_20 function, but otherwise the structure and the effect of the code are the same.

A function may create a closure and return it, as in this example:
// Return a function that approximates the derivative of f
// using an interval of dx, which should be appropriately small.
function derivative(f, dx) {
 return x =&gt; (f(x + dx) - f(x)) / dx;


Because the closure in this case outlives the execution of the function that creates it, the variables codice_11 and codice_28 live on after the function codice_29 returns, even though execution has left their scope and they are no longer visible. In languages without closures, the lifetime of an automatic local variable coincides with the execution of the stack frame where that variable is declared. In languages with closures, variables must continue to exist as long as any existing closures have references to them. This is most commonly implemented using some form of garbage collection.

=== State representation ===
A closure can be used to associate a function with a set of &quot;private&quot; variables, which persist over several invocations of the function. The scope of the variable encompasses only the closed-over function, so it cannot be accessed from other program code. These are analogous to private variables in object-oriented programming, and in fact closures are similar to stateful function objects (or functors) with a single call-operator method.

In stateful languages, closures can thus be used to implement paradigms for state representation and information hiding, since the closure&#x27;s upvalues (its closed-over variables) are of indefinite extent, so a value established in one invocation remains available in the next. Closures used in this way no longer have referential transparency, and are thus no longer pure functions; nevertheless, they are commonly used in impure functional languages such as Scheme.

=== Other uses ===
Closures have many uses:
* Because closures delay evaluation—i.e., they do not &quot;do&quot; anything until they are called—they can be used to define control structures. For example, all of Smalltalk&#x27;s standard control structures, including branches (if/then/else) and loops (while and for), are defined using objects whose methods accept closures. Users can easily define their own control structures also.
* In languages which implement assignment, multiple functions can be produced that close over the same environment, enabling them to communicate privately by altering that environment. In Scheme:
(define foo #f)
(define bar #f)

(let ((secret-message &quot;none&quot;))
 (set! foo (lambda (msg) (set! secret-message msg)))
 (set! bar (lambda () secret-message)))

(display (bar)) ; prints &quot;none&quot;
(newline)
(foo &quot;meet me by the docks at midnight&quot;)
(display (bar)) ; prints &quot;meet me by the docks at midnight&quot;
* Closures can be used to implement object systems.

Note: Some speakers call any data structure that binds a lexical environment a closure, but the term usually refers specifically to functions.

== Implementation and theory ==
Closures are typically implemented with a special data structure that contains a pointer to the function code, plus a representation of the function&#x27;s lexical environment (i.e., the set of available variables) at the time when the closure was created. The referencing environment binds the non-local names to the corresponding variables in the lexical environment at the time the closure is created, additionally extending their lifetime to at least as long as the lifetime of the closure. When the closure is entered at a later time, possibly with a different lexical environment, the function is executed with its non-local variables referring to the ones captured by the closure, not the current environment.

A language implementation cannot easily support full closures if its run-time memory model allocates all automatic variables on a linear stack. In such languages, a function&#x27;s automatic local variables are deallocated when the function returns. However, a closure requires that the free variables it references survive the enclosing function&#x27;s execution. Therefore, those variables must be allocated so that they persist until no longer needed, typically via heap allocation, rather than on the stack, and their lifetime must be managed so they survive until all closures referencing them are no longer in use.

This explains why, typically, languages that natively support closures also use garbage collection. The alternatives are manual memory management of non-local variables (explicitly allocating on the heap and freeing when done), or, if using stack allocation, for the language to accept that certain use cases will lead to undefined behaviour, due to dangling pointers to freed automatic variables, as in lambda expressions in C++11 or nested functions in GNU C. The funarg problem (or &quot;functional argument&quot; problem) describes the difficulty of implementing functions as first class objects in a stack-based programming language such as C or C++. Similarly in D version 1, it is assumed that the programmer knows what to do with delegates and automatic local variables, as their references will be invalid after return from its definition scope (automatic local variables are on the stack) – this still permits many useful functional patterns, but for complex cases needs explicit heap allocation for variables. D version 2 solved this by detecting which variables must be stored on the heap, and performs automatic allocation. Because D uses garbage collection, in both versions, there is no need to track usage of variables as they are passed.

In strict functional languages with immutable data (&quot;e.g.&quot; Erlang), it is very easy to implement automatic memory management (garbage collection), as there are no possible cycles in variables&#x27; references. For example, in Erlang, all arguments and variables are allocated on the heap, but references to them are additionally stored on the stack. After a function returns, references are still valid. Heap cleaning is done by incremental garbage collector.

In ML, local variables are lexically scoped, and hence define a stack-like model, but since they are bound to values and not to objects, an implementation is free to copy these values into the closure&#x27;s data structure in a way that is invisible to the programmer.

Scheme, which has an ALGOL-like lexical scope system with dynamic variables and garbage collection, lacks a stack programming model and does not suffer from the limitations of stack-based languages. Closures are expressed naturally in Scheme. The lambda form encloses the code, and the free variables of its environment persist within the program as long as they can possibly be accessed, and so they can be used as freely as any other Scheme expression.

Closures are closely related to Actors in the Actor model of concurrent computation where the values in the function&#x27;s lexical environment are called &quot;acquaintances&quot;. An important issue for closures in concurrent programming languages is whether the variables in a closure can be updated and, if so, how these updates can be synchronized. Actors provide one solution.

Closures are closely related to function objects; the transformation from the former to the latter is known as defunctionalization or lambda lifting; see also closure conversion.

== Differences in semantics ==

=== Lexical environment ===
As different languages do not always have a common definition of the lexical environment, their definitions of closure may vary also. The commonly held minimalist definition of the lexical environment defines it as a set of all bindings of variables in the scope, and that is also what closures in any language have to capture. However the meaning of a variable binding also differs. In imperative languages, variables bind to relative locations in memory that can store values. Although the relative location of a binding does not change at runtime, the value in the bound location can. In such languages, since closure captures the binding, any operation on the variable, whether done from the closure or not, are performed on the same relative memory location. This is often called capturing the variable &quot;by reference&quot;. Here is an example illustrating the concept in ECMAScript, which is one such language:
// Javascript
var f, g;
function foo() {
 var x;
 f = function() { return ++x; };
 g = function() { return --x; };
 x = 1;
 alert(&#x27;inside foo, call to f(): &#x27; + f());
foo(); // 2
alert(&#x27;call to g(): &#x27; + g()); // 1 (--x)
alert(&#x27;call to g(): &#x27; + g()); // 0 (--x)
alert(&#x27;call to f(): &#x27; + f()); // 1 (++x)
alert(&#x27;call to f(): &#x27; + f()); // 2 (++x)
Function codice_30 and the closures referred to by variables codice_11 and codice_6 all use the same relative memory location signified by local variable codice_3.

In some instances the above behaviour may be undesirable, and it is necessary to bind a different lexical closure. Again in ECMAScript, this would be done using the codice_34.

===Example 1: Reference to an unbound variable===
var module = {
 x: 42,
 getX: function() {return this.x; }
var unboundGetX = module.getX;
console.log(unboundGetX()); // The function gets invoked at the global scope
// emits undefined as &#x27;x&#x27; is not specified in global scope.

var boundGetX = unboundGetX.bind(module); // specify object module as the closure
console.log(boundGetX()); // emits 42
===Example 2: Accidental reference to a bound variable===
For this example the expected behaviour would be that each link should emit its id when clicked; but because the variable &#x27;e&#x27; is bound to the scope above, and lazy evaluated on click, what actually happens is that each on click event emits the id of the last element in &#x27;elements&#x27; bound at the end of the for loop.

var elements = document.getElementsByTagName(&#x27;a&#x27;);
// Incorrect: e is bound to the function containing the &#x27;for&#x27; loop, not the closure of &quot;handle&quot;
for (var e of elements) { 
 e.onclick = function handle() { 
 alert(e.id);
} 

Again here variable codice_35 would need to be bound by the scope of the block using codice_36 or the codice_37 keyword.

On the other hand, many functional languages, such as ML, bind variables directly to values. In this case, since there is no way to change the value of the variable once it is bound, there is no need to share the state between closures—they just use the same values. This is often called capturing the variable &quot;by value&quot;. Java&#x27;s local and anonymous classes also fall into this category—they require captured local variables to be codice_38, which also means there is no need to share state.

Some languages enable choosing between capturing the value of a variable or its location. For example, in C++11, captured variables are either declared with codice_39, which means captured by reference, or with codice_40, which means captured by value.

Yet another subset, lazy functional languages such as Haskell, bind variables to results of future computations rather than values. Consider this example in Haskell:
-- Haskell
foo :: Fractional a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; (a -&gt; a)
foo x y = (\z -&gt; z + r)
 where r = x / y

f :: Fractional a =&gt; a -&gt; a
f = foo 1 0

main = print (f 123)
The binding of codice_41 captured by the closure defined within function codice_30 is to the computation codice_43—which in this case results in division by zero. However, since it is the computation that is captured, and not the value, the error only manifests when the closure is invoked, and then attempts to use the captured binding.

=== Closure leaving ===
Yet more differences manifest themselves in the behavior of other lexically scoped constructs, such as codice_44, codice_45 and codice_46 statements. Such constructs can, in general, be considered in terms of invoking an escape continuation established by an enclosing control statement (in case of codice_45 and codice_46, such interpretation requires looping constructs to be considered in terms of recursive function calls). In some languages, such as ECMAScript, codice_44 refers to the continuation established by the closure lexically innermost with respect to the statement—thus, a codice_44 within a closure transfers control to the code that called it. However, in Smalltalk, the superficially similar operator codice_51 invokes the escape continuation established for the method invocation, ignoring the escape continuations of any intervening nested closures. The escape continuation of a particular closure can only be invoked in Smalltalk implicitly by reaching the end of the closure&#x27;s code. These examples in ECMAScript and Smalltalk highlight the difference:
&quot;Smalltalk&quot;
foo
 | xs |
 xs := #(1 2 3 4).
 xs do: [:x | ^x].
 ^0
bar
 Transcript show: (self foo printString) &quot;prints 1&quot;

// ECMAScript
function foo() {
 var xs = [1, 2, 3, 4];
 xs.forEach(function (x) { return x; });
 return 0;
alert(foo()); // prints 0
The above code snippets will behave differently because the Smalltalk codice_51 operator and the JavaScript codice_44 operator are not analogous. In the ECMAScript example, codice_54 will leave the inner closure to begin a new iteration of the codice_55 loop, whereas in the Smalltalk example, codice_56 will abort the loop and return from the method codice_30.

Common Lisp provides a construct that can express either of the above actions: Lisp codice_58 behaves as Smalltalk codice_56, while Lisp codice_60 behaves as JavaScript codice_54. Hence, Smalltalk makes it possible for a captured escape continuation to outlive the extent in which it can be successfully invoked. Consider:
&quot;Smalltalk&quot;
foo
 ^[ :x | ^x ]
bar
 | f |
 f := self foo.
 f value: 123 &quot;error!&quot;
When the closure returned by the method codice_30 is invoked, it attempts to return a value from the invocation of codice_30 that created the closure. Since that call has already returned and the Smalltalk method invocation model does not follow the spaghetti stack discipline to facilitate multiple returns, this operation results in an error.

Some languages, such as Ruby, enable the programmer to choose the way codice_44 is captured. An example in Ruby:
# Ruby

# Closure using a Proc
def foo
 f = Proc.new { return &quot;return from foo from inside proc&quot; }
 f.call # control leaves foo here
 return &quot;return from foo&quot;
end

# Closure using a lambda
def bar
 f = lambda { return &quot;return from lambda&quot; }
 f.call # control does not leave bar here
 return &quot;return from bar&quot;
end

puts foo # prints &quot;return from foo from inside proc&quot;
puts bar # prints &quot;return from bar&quot;
Both codice_65 and codice_7 in this example are ways to create a closure, but semantics of the closures thus created are different with respect to the codice_44 statement.

In Scheme, definition and scope of the codice_44 control statement is explicit (and only arbitrarily named &#x27;return&#x27; for the sake of the example). The following is a direct translation of the Ruby sample.
; Scheme
(define call/cc call-with-current-continuation)

(define (foo)
 (call/cc
 (lambda (return)
 (define (f) (return &quot;return from foo from inside proc&quot;))
 (f) ; control leaves foo here
 (return &quot;return from foo&quot;))))

(define (bar)
 (call/cc
 (lambda (return)
 (define (f) (call/cc (lambda (return) (return &quot;return from lambda&quot;))))
 (f) ; control does not leave bar here
 (return &quot;return from bar&quot;))))

(display (foo)) ; prints &quot;return from foo from inside proc&quot;
(newline)
(display (bar)) ; prints &quot;return from bar&quot;
== Closure-like constructs ==
Some languages have features which simulate the behavior of closures. In languages such as C++, C#, D, Java, Objective-C, and Visual Basic (.NET) (VB.NET), these features are the result of the language&#x27;s object-oriented paradigm.

=== Callbacks (C) ===
Some C libraries support callbacks. This is sometimes implemented by providing two values when registering the callback with the library: a function pointer and a separate codice_69 pointer to arbitrary data of the user&#x27;s choice. When the library executes the callback function, it passes along the data pointer. This enables the callback to maintain state and to refer to information captured at the time it was registered with the library. The idiom is similar to closures in functionality, but not in syntax. The codice_69 pointer is not type safe so this C idiom differs from type-safe closures in C#, Haskell or ML.

Callbacks are used extensively in graphical user interface (GUI) widget toolkits to implement event-driven programming by associating general functions of graphical widgets (menus, buttons, check boxes, sliders, spinners, etc.) with application-specific functions implementing the specific desired behavior for the application.

====Nested function and function pointer (C)====
With a GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) extension, a nested function can be used and a function pointer can emulate closures, provided the function does not exit the containing scope. The next example is invalid because codice_71 is a top-level definition (depending on compiler version, it could produce a correct result if compiled with no optimizing, i.e., at codice_72):
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

typedef int (*fn_int_to_int)(int); // type of function int-&gt;int

fn_int_to_int adder(int number) {
 int add (int value) { return value + number; }
 return &amp;add; // &amp; operator is optional here because the name of a function in C is a pointer pointing on itself

int main(void) {
 fn_int_to_int add10 = adder(10);
 printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, add10(1));
 return 0;


But moving codice_71 (and, optionally, the codice_74) in codice_75 makes it valid:
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void) {
 typedef int (*fn_int_to_int)(int); // type of function int-&gt;int
 fn_int_to_int adder(int number) {
 int add (int value) { return value + number; }
 return add;
 
 fn_int_to_int add10 = adder(10);
 printf(&quot;%d\n&quot;, add10(1));
 return 0;


If executed this now prints codice_76 as expected.

=== Local classes and lambda functions (Java) ===
Java enables classes to be defined inside methods. These are called &quot;local classes&quot;. When such classes are not named, they are known as &quot;anonymous classes&quot; (or anonymous &quot;inner&quot; classes). A local class (either named or anonymous) may refer to names in lexically enclosing classes, or read-only variables (marked as codice_38) in the lexically enclosing method.
class CalculationWindow extends JFrame {
 private volatile int result;
 public void calculateInSeparateThread(final URI uri) {
 // The expression &quot;new Runnable() { ... }&quot; is an anonymous class implementing the &#x27;Runnable&#x27; interface.
 new Thread(
 new Runnable() {
 void run() {
 // It can read final local variables:
 calculate(uri);
 // It can access private fields of the enclosing class:
 result = result + 10;
 }
 ).start();
}
The capturing of codice_38 variables enables capturing variables by value. Even if the variable to capture is non-codice_38, it can always be copied to a temporary codice_38 variable just before the class.

Capturing of variables by reference can be emulated by using a codice_38 reference to a mutable container, for example, a one-element array. The local class will not be able to change the value of the container reference, but it will be able to change the contents of the container.

With the advent of Java 8&#x27;s lambda expressions, the closure causes the above code to be executed as:
class CalculationWindow extends JFrame {
 private volatile int result;
 public void calculateInSeparateThread(final URI uri) {
 // The code () -&gt; { /* code */ } is a closure.
 new Thread(() -&gt; {
 calculate(uri);
 result = result + 10;
 }).start();
}
Local classes are one of the types of inner class that are declared within the body of a method. Java also supports inner classes that are declared as &quot;non-static members&quot; of an enclosing class. They are normally referred to just as &quot;inner classes&quot;. These are defined in the body of the enclosing class and have full access to instance variables of the enclosing class. Due to their binding to these instance variables, an inner class may only be instantiated with an explicit binding to an instance of the enclosing class using a special syntax.
public class EnclosingClass {
 /* Define the inner class */
 public class InnerClass {
 public int incrementAndReturnCounter() {
 return counter++;
 }

 private int counter;
 counter = 0;

 public int getCounter() {
 return counter;

 public static void main(String[] args) {
 EnclosingClass enclosingClassInstance = new EnclosingClass();
 /* Instantiate the inner class, with binding to the instance */
 EnclosingClass.InnerClass innerClassInstance =
 enclosingClassInstance.new InnerClass();

 for (int i = enclosingClassInstance.getCounter();
 (i = innerClassInstance.incrementAndReturnCounter()) &lt; 10;
 /* increment step omitted */) {
 System.out.println(i);
 }


Upon execution, this will print the integers from 0 to 9. Beware to not confuse this type of class with the nested class, which is declared in the same way with an accompanied usage of the &quot;static&quot; modifier; those have not the desired effect but are instead just classes with no special binding defined in an enclosing class.

As of Java 8, Java supports functions as first class objects. Lambda expressions of this form are considered of type codice_82 with T being the domain and U the image type. The expression can be called with its codice_83 method, but not with a standard method call.
public static void main(String[] args) {
 Function&lt;String, Integer&gt; length = s -&gt; s.length();

 System.out.println( length.apply(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;) ); // Will print 13.


=== Blocks (C, C++, Objective-C 2.0) ===

Apple introduced blocks, a form of closure, as a nonstandard extension into C, C++, Objective-C 2.0 and in Mac OS X 10.6 &quot;Snow Leopard&quot; and iOS 4.0. Apple made their implementation available for the GCC and clang compilers.

Pointers to block and block literals are marked with codice_51. Normal local variables are captured by value when the block is created, and are read-only inside the block. Variables to be captured by reference are marked with codice_85. Blocks that need to persist outside of the scope they are created in may need to be copied.
typedef int (^IntBlock)();

IntBlock downCounter(int start) {
 __block int i = start;
 return [[ ^int() {
 return i--;
 } copy] autorelease];

IntBlock f = downCounter(5);
NSLog(@&quot;%d&quot;, f());
NSLog(@&quot;%d&quot;, f());
NSLog(@&quot;%d&quot;, f());
=== Delegates (C#, VB.NET, D) ===
[[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] anonymous methods and lambda expressions support closure:
var data = new[] {1, 2, 3, 4};
var multiplier = 2;
var result = data.Select(x =&gt; x * multiplier);
[[Visual Basic .NET]], which has many language features similar to those of C#, also supports lambda expressions with closures:
Dim data = {1, 2, 3, 4}
Dim multiplier = 2
Dim result = data.Select(Function(x) x * multiplier)
In [[D (programming language)|D]], closures are implemented by delegates, a function pointer paired with a context pointer (e.g. a class instance, or a stack frame on the heap in the case of closures).
auto test1() {
 int a = 7;
 return delegate() { return a + 3; }; // anonymous delegate construction

auto test2() {
 int a = 20;
 int foo() { return a + 5; } // inner function
 return &amp;foo; // other way to construct delegate

void bar() {
 auto dg = test1();
 dg(); // =10 // ok, test1.a is in a closure and still exists

 dg = test2();
 dg(); // =25 // ok, test2.a is in a closure and still exists


D version 1, has limited closure support. For example, the above code will not work correctly, because the variable a is on the stack, and after returning from test(), it is no longer valid to use it (most probably calling foo via dg(), will return a &#x27;random&#x27; integer). This can be solved by explicitly allocating the variable &#x27;a&#x27; on heap, or using structs or class to store all needed closed variables and construct a delegate from a method implementing the same code. Closures can be passed to other functions, as long as they are only used while the referenced values are still valid (for example calling another function with a closure as a callback parameter), and are useful for writing generic data processing code, so this limitation, in practice, is often not an issue.

This limitation was fixed in D version 2 - the variable &#x27;a&#x27; will be automatically allocated on the heap because it is used in the inner function, and a delegate of that function can escape the current scope (via assignment to dg or return). Any other local variables (or arguments) that are not referenced by delegates or that are only referenced by delegates that do not escape the current scope, remain on the stack, which is simpler and faster than heap allocation. The same is true for inner&#x27;s class methods that reference a function&#x27;s variables.

=== Function objects (C++) ===
[[C++]] enables defining [[function object]]s by overloading codice_86. These objects behave somewhat like functions in a functional programming language. They may be created at runtime and may contain state, but they do not implicitly capture local variables as closures do. As of [[C++11|the 2011 revision]], the C++ language also supports closures, which are a type of function object constructed automatically from a special language construct called &quot;lambda-expression&quot;. A C++ closure may capture its context either by storing copies of the accessed variables as members of the closure object or by reference. In the latter case, if the closure object escapes the scope of a referenced object, invoking its codice_86 causes undefined behavior since C++ closures do not extend the lifetime of their context.
void foo(string myname) {
 int y;
 vector&lt;string&gt; n;
 auto i = std::find_if(n.begin(), n.end(),
 // this is the lambda expression:
 [&amp;](const string&amp; s) { return s != myname &amp;&amp; s.size() &gt; y; }
 // &#x27;i&#x27; is now either &#x27;n.end()&#x27; or points to the first string in &#x27;n&#x27;
 // which is not equal to &#x27;myname&#x27; and whose length is greater than &#x27;y&#x27;


=== Inline agents (Eiffel) ===
[[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]] includes inline agents defining closures. An inline agent is an object representing a routine, defined by giving the code of the routine in-line. For example, in
ok_button.click_event.subscribe (
 agent (x, y: INTEGER) do
 map.country_at_coordinates (x, y).display
 end


the argument to codice_88 is an agent, representing a procedure with two arguments; the procedure finds the country at the corresponding coordinates and displays it. The whole agent is &quot;subscribed&quot; to the event type codice_89 for a
certain button, so that whenever an instance of the event type occurs on that button – because a user has clicked the button – the procedure will be executed with the mouse coordinates being passed as arguments for codice_3 and codice_91.

The main limitation of Eiffel agents, which distinguishes them from closures in other languages, is that they cannot reference local variables from the enclosing scope. This design decision helps in avoiding ambiguity when talking about a local variable value in a closure - should it be the latest value of the variable or the value captured when the agent is created? Only codice_92 (a reference to current object, analogous to codice_93 in Java), its features, and arguments of the agent can be accessed from within the agent body. The values of the outer local variables can be passed by providing additional closed operands to the agent.

=== C++Builder __closure reserved word ===
Embarcadero C++Builder provides the reserved word codice_94 to provide a pointer to a method with a similar syntax to a function pointer.

Standard C allows writing a for a pointer to a [[function type]] using the following syntax:
typedef void (*TMyFunctionPointer)( void );
In a similar way, a can be declared for a pointer to a method using this syntax:
typedef void (__closure *TMyMethodPointer)();

<text>Samwise Gamgee (, usually called Sam) is a fictional character in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth. A hobbit, Samwise is the chief supporting character of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, serving as the loyal companion (in effect, the manservant) of the protagonist Frodo Baggins. Sam is a member of the Company of the Ring, the group of nine charged with destroying the One Ring to prevent the Dark Lord Sauron from taking over the world.

Sam was Frodo&#x27;s gardener. He was drawn into Frodo&#x27;s adventure while eavesdropping on a private conversation Frodo was having with the wizard Gandalf. Sam was Frodo&#x27;s steadfast companion and servant, portrayed as both physically strong for his size and emotionally strong, often supporting Frodo through difficult parts of the journey and, at times, carrying Frodo when he was too weak to go on. Sam served as Ring-bearer for a short time when Frodo was captured by orcs; his emotional strength was again demonstrated when he willingly gave the Ring back to Frodo. Following the War of the Ring, Sam returned to the Shire and his role as a gardener, helping to replant the trees which had been destroyed while he was away. He was elected Mayor of the Shire for seven consecutive terms.

The name Gamgee derives from a local name for cotton wool, from a surgical dressing invented by Sampson Gamgee; hence Sam&#x27;s girlfriend Rosie is from the Cotton family. Scholars have remarked on the symbolism in Sam&#x27;s story, which carries echoes of Christianity; for instance, his carrying of Frodo is reminiscent of Simon of Cyrene&#x27;s carrying of Christ&#x27;s cross. Tolkien considered Sam a hero of the story. Psychologists have seen Sam&#x27;s quest as a psychological journey of love. Tolkien&#x27;s biographers have noted the resemblance of Sam&#x27;s relationship with Frodo to that of military servants to British Army officers in the First World War.

== Fictional biography ==

=== The War of the Ring ===

As told in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Samwise Gamgee is Frodo Baggins&#x27;s gardener, having inherited the position from his father, Hamfast &quot;Gaffer&quot; Gamgee, who was Bilbo Baggins&#x27;s gardener. As &quot;punishment&quot; for eavesdropping on Gandalf&#x27;s conversation with Frodo about the One Ring, Sam is made Frodo&#x27;s first companion on his journey to Rivendell. They are joined by Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took, Frodo&#x27;s cousins, travelling together to Rivendell. At the Council of Elrond there, Sam joins the Fellowship of the Ring. In the elvish land of Lothlórien, Galadriel gives Sam a small box of earth from her garden.

When the Fellowship splits up at the Falls of Rauros, Sam insists on accompanying Frodo. Sam protects and cares for Frodo, who is growing weaker under the Ring&#x27;s influence, as they move through the dangerous lands toward Mordor. Sam distrusts Gollum, who became their guide into Mordor, leading them through the Dead Marshes. His suspicions are confirmed in the mountain pass of Cirith Ungol, where Gollum betrays them to the giant spider Shelob. Shelob stings Frodo, and Sam drives her off. A band of orcs approaches; Sam chooses to leave the apparently dead Frodo and take the Ring himself, and briefly becomes the Ring-bearer. He is momentarily tempted by the Ring&#x27;s promise of power, but does not succumb to it. Sam then rescues Frodo (who had only been paralysed) from the Orcs who held him captive. Sam returns the ring to Frodo. The two journey through Mordor and into Mount Doom. Sam carries Frodo on his back for some of the way. Gollum attacks Frodo and reclaims the Ring, only to destroy both it and himself by falling into one of the Cracks of Doom.

=== The Scouring of the Shire ===

The hobbits return home horrified to find the Shire under the control of &quot;Sharkey&quot; (Saruman) and his ruffians who had wantonly felled trees and despoiled the villages; the hobbits defeat them at the Battle of Bywater and scour the Shire of all the ruffians and their works. Sam travels the length and breadth of the Shire replanting trees, using the elf-queen Galadriel&#x27;s gift of earth from her garden, and one seed of the elvish mallorn tree, which he plants at Hobbiton. The saplings grow at an astonishing rate.

=== In the Fourth Age ===

Sam marries Rosie Cotton and moves into Bag End with Frodo. The next year they have a daughter, Elanor, the first of their thirteen children. Frodo tells Sam that he (Frodo) and Bilbo will leave Middle-earth, along with Gandalf and most of the remaining High Elves, for the Undying Lands. Frodo gives Sam the estate of Bag End, and the &quot;Red Book of Westmarch&quot; for Sam to continue, hinting that Sam may also be allowed to travel into the West eventually. Sam returns to meet his family at Bag End, ending the story with the words &quot;Well, I&#x27;m back.&quot;

The Appendices note that in the year 1427 of the Shire Reckoning, Sam was elected Mayor of the Shire for the first of seven consecutive seven-year terms. His descendants took the surname Gardner in his honour.

== Analysis ==

=== Christianity ===

Tolkien intentionally avoided making Christianity explicit in his Middle-earth writings, choosing instead to allow &quot;the story and the symbolism&quot; to convey his meaning. Frodo finds the Ring a crushing weight, just as the cross was for Jesus. Sam, who carries Frodo up to Mount Doom, parallels Simon of Cyrene, who helps Jesus by carrying his cross to Golgotha. Sam gains prominence as he is willing to be unimportant in doing his duty, echoing the Christian emphasis on the humble. The ordeal of crossing Mordor, too, reflects the Christian theme of redemptive suffering.

=== Heroism ===

Tolkien called Sam the &quot;chief hero&quot; of the saga, adding: &quot;I think the simple &#x27;rustic&#x27; love of Sam and his Rosie (nowhere elaborated) is absolutely essential to the study of his (the chief hero&#x27;s) character, and to the theme of the relation of ordinary life (breathing, eating, working, begetting) and quests, sacrifice, causes, and the &#x27;longing for Elves&#x27;, and sheer beauty.&quot; Tolkien admired heroism out of loyalty and love, but despised arrogance, pride and wilfulness. The courage and loyalty displayed by Samwise Gamgee on his journey with Frodo is the kind of spirit that Tolkien praised in his essays on the Old English poem &quot;The Battle of Maldon&quot;. Likewise, Sam&#x27;s rejection of the Ring is a rejection of power, but also a &quot;desire for renown which the defeat over Sauron will bring&quot;.

Tom Shippey notes Sam&#x27;s courage, which among other things takes the form of &quot;be[ing] &#x27;cheerful&#x27; without any hope at all&quot;. Shippey comments that this may hardly appear sensible, but it &quot;rings true&quot;, appearing in old soldiers&#x27; recollections of the First World War. He notes the etymology of &quot;cheer&quot;, from Old French &quot;chair&quot;, meaning &quot;face&quot;, commenting that &quot;a stout pretence&quot; is better than &quot;sincere despair&quot;. Further, in the grimness of the Stairs of Cirith Ungol, he and Frodo imagine people &quot;laughing at grief&quot;, something that Shippey calls Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;new model of courage&quot;.

=== Psychological journey ===

The Jungian clinical psychologist Robin Robertson describes Sam&#x27;s quest as a psychological journey of love (for Frodo), where Frodo&#x27;s quest is one of transcendence. Robertson writes that &quot;Sam&#x27;s is the simplest yet the most touching of all paths: his simple loyalty and love for Frodo make him the single person who never wavers in his task throughout the book.&quot; In his view, Sam always stays grounded in simple things like meals and the glory of a sunrise, while Sam ends as the happiest of the Fellowship, having seen the Elves, served as Frodo&#x27;s companion on the quest, and back in the Shire that he loves, marries Rosie and is blessed with many children.

The Jungian analyst Pia Skogemann views Sam as standing for one of the four cognitive functions, namely feeling, with the other three assigned to the other hobbits in the Fellowship: Frodo stands for thinking, Pippin for intuition, and Merry for sensation.

=== Relationship with Frodo ===

During the journey to destroy the Ring, Sam&#x27;s relationship with Frodo exemplifies that of a military servant or batman to his assigned officer in the British Army, in particular in the First World War in which Tolkien had served as an officer, with different batmen at different times. His biographer John Garth stated:

Tolkien wrote in a private letter: &quot;My Sam Gamgee is indeed a reflexion of the English soldier, of the privates and batmen I knew in the 1914 war, and recognised as so far superior to myself.&quot; and elsewhere: &quot;Sam was cocksure, and deep down a little conceited; but his conceit had been transformed by his devotion to Frodo. He did not think of himself as heroic or even brave, or in any way admirable – except in his service and loyalty to his master.&quot;

Although Tolkien does not explicitly say so, Sam is in effect Frodo&#x27;s self-appointed manservant, carrying out more mundane chores thus relieving his &quot;master&quot; of the necessity to do so, the term being used in (for example) Ishay Landa&#x27;s essay &quot;Slaves of the Ring: Tolkien&#x27;s Political Unconscious&quot;. Tolkien himself gets closest to this terminology, possibly inadvertently, when in the account &quot;Of The Rings of Power&quot; in &quot;The Simarillion&quot; he writes: &quot;For Frodo the Halfling, it is said, at the bidding of Mithrandir took on himself the burden [of destroying the One Ring], and alone with his servant he passed through peril and darkness and came at last in Sauron&#x27;s despite even to Mount Doom; and there into the Fire where it was wrought he cast the Great Ring of Power, and so at last it was unmade and its evil consumed.&quot;

=== Name ===

Tolkien states in his &quot;Guide to the Names in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;&quot; for translators of the book that he took the name &quot;Gamgee&quot; from a colloquial word in Birmingham for cotton wool. This came from Gamgee Tissue, a surgical dressing invented by the 19th-century Birmingham surgeon Sampson Gamgee. He claimed to have been genuinely surprised when, in March 1956, he received a letter from one Sam Gamgee, who had heard that his name was in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; but had not read the book. Tolkien replied politely and sent Gamgee a signed copy of all three volumes of the book. He recorded in his journal &quot;For some time I lived in fear of receiving a letter signed &#x27;S. Gollum&#x27;. That would have been more difficult to deal with.&quot;

In the fiction, Tolkien pretends that Sam&#x27;s name is translated from the Westron &quot;Banazîr Galbasi&quot;. The forename comes from elements meaning &quot;halfwise&quot; or &quot;simple&quot;, exactly matching the Old English &quot;Samwís&quot;. &quot;Galbasi&quot; comes from the name of the village &quot;&quot;. This uses the elements &quot;galab-&quot;, meaning &quot;game&quot;, and &quot;bas-&quot;, roughly matching the English placename endings &quot;-wich&quot; or &quot;-wick&quot; (meaning in Old English a dwelling or specialised farm). In his frame story role as &quot;translator&quot; of the &quot;Red Book of Westmarch&quot;, Tolkien devised a strict English translation, &quot;Samwís Gamwich&quot;, which develops into &quot;Samwise Gammidgy&quot; and eventually comes to &quot;Samwise Gamgee&quot; in modern English. 

Tolkien states in a letter that &quot;Since Sam was close friends of the family of Cotton (another village-name), I was led astray into the Hobbit-like joke of spelling Gamwichy [as] Gamgee, though I do not think that in actual Hobbit-dialect the joke really arose&quot;, i.e. he was punning on the connected meanings in English of the Gamgee and Cotton family names, &quot;cotton wool&quot; and &quot;cotton [fabric]&quot;.

== Adaptations ==

In the 1971 Mind&#x27;s Eye radio adaptation, Sam was voiced by Lou Bliss.
In Ralph Bakshi&#x27;s 1978 animated version of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Sam was voiced by Michael Scholes.
In the 1980 animated version of &quot;The Return of the King&quot;, made for television, the character was voiced by Roddy McDowall.
In the 1981 BBC radio adaptation of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Sam was played by Bill Nighy.
In the 1993 Finnish television miniseries &quot;Hobitit&quot;, Sam is portrayed by Pertti Sveholm.

In the Peter Jackson movies &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; (2001), &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers&quot; (2002) and &quot;The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot; (2003), Sam was played by Sean Astin. The batman relationship and class differences between Sam and Frodo are somewhat subdued, though Sam still refers to Frodo as &quot;Mr.&quot; (but not &quot;Master&quot;). &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called Sam Gamgee one of the &quot;greatest sidekicks.&quot; UGO Networks named Sam as one of their top heroes in entertainment.

On stage, Sam was portrayed by Peter Howe in the Toronto stage production of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, which opened in 2006. In the United States, Sam was portrayed by Blake Bowden in the Cincinnati productions of &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot; (2001), &quot;The Two Towers&quot; (2002), and &quot;The Return of the King&quot; (2003) for Clear Stage Cincinnati.

<text>Cloture (, also ), closure or, informally, a guillotine, is a motion or process in parliamentary procedure aimed at bringing debate to a quick end.

The cloture procedure originated in the French National Assembly, from which the name is taken. is French for &quot;the act of terminating something&quot;.

It was introduced into the Parliament of the United Kingdom by William Ewart Gladstone to overcome the obstructionism of the Irish Parliamentary Party and was made permanent in 1887.

It was subsequently adopted by the United States Senate and other legislatures. The name &quot;cloture&quot; remains in the United States; in Commonwealth countries it is usually &quot;closure&quot; or, informally, &quot;guillotine&quot;; in the United Kingdom &quot;closure&quot; and &quot;guillotine&quot; are distinct motions.

==Australia==
In Australia, the procedure by which finite debating times for particular bills are set, or protracted debates are brought to a close, is referred to as a &quot;guillotine&quot; or “gag”. Generally, a minister will declare that a bill must be considered as urgent, and move a motion to limit debating time. The declaration and motion may refer to a single bill, or to multiple bills or packages of bills. A guillotine motion may not be debated or amended, and must be put to a vote immediately.

==Canada==
After a number of occasions where the opposition managed to delay or prevent passage of government bills, closure in Canada was adopted by the House of Commons in 1913 on the motion of Conservative Prime Minister Robert Borden. The new closure rule was used by the government only a few days later, during debate at the Committee of the Whole stage of the Naval Aid Bill. Between 1913 and 1932, closure was invoked 11 times. It was used next time in 1956 during the passage of a bill to establish the Northern Ontario Pipeline Crown Corporation. &quot;Closure&quot; is the term used in Canada; &quot;cloture&quot; and &quot;guillotine&quot; are not used. Closure was used to force the adoption of a single red maple leaf flag design on December 15, 1964. 

Procedure on closure in Canada is governed under Standing Order no. 57 of the House of Commons and consists of three parts: Notice of closure, a motion of closure, and a final period of debate before final voting on the bill being closured.

Notice of closure is an oral statement announcing intention to call for closure given by any Minister at a prior sitting of the Committee of the Whole. The notice need not be the day immediately prior to the sitting at which the bill will be closured, but cannot be in the same sitting as the final motion of closure.

The motion of closure, referred to as a motion &quot;that the debate shall not be further adjourned&quot;, is passed by a simple majority of the House of Commons, although in the event of a tie, the Speaker of the House will apply Speaker Denison&#x27;s rule to issue the casting vote.

Should the motion of closure pass, all members are given a single period in which to speak lasting no more than 20 minutes. If the final period of speaking to the bill has not been finished by 8:00 p.m. that same day, no MP may speak after that point, and the bill moves to a final vote.

==Hong Kong==
The first cloture in Hong Kong was introduced in the Legislative Council of Hong Kong on 17 May 2012, by Tsang Yok-sing (President of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong), to abruptly halt filibuster during debate at the Committee of the Whole stage of the Legislative Council (Amendment) Bill 2012. The motion to end debate was submitted by Council member Philip Wong Yu-hong some time after 4 am Hong Kong time, after a marathon session that lasted over 33 hours. Wong stood up and suggested that legislatures in other countries have a procedure called &quot;cloture motion&quot;, and suggested Council President should end debate immediately. President Tsang agreed and said that he considered ending debate even without Wong&#x27;s suggestion because he would not allow debate to go on endlessly. Cloture is not defined by any rule or precedent of the Legislative Council. Tsang made reference to Standing Order 92, which stated &quot;In any matter not provided for in these Rules of Procedure, the practice and procedure to be followed in the Council shall be such as may be decided by the President who may, if he thinks fit, be guided by the practice and procedure of other legislatures&quot;. Standing Order 92 therefore may implicitly give Council President discretion on whether he should or should not follow the cloture rules of other legislatures, but this is up to debate. Legislative Council President Tsang chose to end debate without calling for a cloture vote, which is questionable. Council member Leung Kwok-hung then stood up and said that he had never heard of cloture without a vote anywhere else and suggested there should have been a cloture vote.

Cloture was again invoked by Tsang Yok-sing on 13 May 2013 to halt debate of the 2013 Appropriation Bill.

==New Zealand==
In the New Zealand House of Representatives, any MP called to speak may move a closure motion. If the length of the debate is not fixed by standing orders or the Business Committee, the Speaker may decide to put the closure motion to a vote, which is carried by a simple majority.

==United Kingdom==

===Procedures===
A &quot;closure motion&quot; may be adopted to end debate on a matter both in the House of Commons and in the House of Lords by a simple majority of those voting. In the House of Commons, at least 100 MPs (not counting two acting as tellers) must vote in favour of the motion for closure to be adopted; the Speaker of the House of Commons may choose to deny the closure motion, if insufficient debate has occurred, or that the procedure is being used to violate the rights of the minority. In the House of Lords, the Lord Speaker does not possess an equivalent power. However he must read a statement stating the motion should only be used in exceptional circumstances and then asks the member if they wish to persist with moving it. If they do, then the motion is put immediately without debate. Only one closure motion is permitted per debate.

Specific to legislation, a &quot;guillotine motion&quot;, formally an &quot;allocation of time motion&quot;, limits the amount of time for a particular stage of a bill. Debate ceases when the allotted time expires; a single vote is taken immediately to pass the stage of the bill and, in the case of a committee stage or report stage, to accept all undebated sections and government amendments. The use of guillotines has been replaced by the &quot;programme motion&quot;, where the amount of time for each stage is agreed after a bill&#x27;s second reading. Both guillotine motions and programme motions are specific to the Commons; the Lords does not permit time restrictions.

===History===
On 24 January 1881, the second Gladstone ministry attempted to move the first reading of the Protection of Person and Property Bill, a controversial response to the Irish agrarian disturbances known as the Land War. The Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) under Charles Stewart Parnell responded with the most extreme example of its policy of obstructionism by filibuster; after two sittings lasting 22 hours and then 41 hours, the Speaker of the Commons, Henry Brand simply refused to recognise any further IPP MPs wishing to speak, and in the early hours of 2 February 1881 he put the motion, which was passed. The IPP MPs objected that this was an abuse by the speaker of their rights as members, and the government responded by formalising the process as an amendment to the standing orders, moved by Gladstone on 3 February 1881:
Gladstone described it as &quot;a subject of considerable novelty, and of the extremest gravity&quot;, and many Irish members objected and were suspended from the House before the amendment motion was moved.

In 1882, Gladstone proposed a major overhaul of the rules of procedure, and on 20 February debate began on the first resolution, on &quot;putting the question&quot;. The session beginning in November 1882 was devoted entirely to the new rules, and the motion on putting the question was passed, after 19 days&#x27; debate, on 10 November 1882:

The rule was invoked only twice by Gladstone&#x27;s ministry, and the second Salisbury ministry secured its amendment, after six days&#x27; debate, on 1 March 1887:

By 1909, the closure was applicable in committees and to motions as well as in the house and to bills.

In 2000, the Select Committee on the Modernisation of the House of Commons recommended discontinuing the use of allocation of time motions for bills, and instead passing a programme motion to make a programme order. This was accepted by the Commons on 7 November 2000. One of the Cameron–Clegg coalition&#x27;s most significant parliamentary defeats was in 2012, on the programme motion for the House of Lords Reform Bill 2012; some rebel MPs agreed with the substance of the bill but felt not enough time had been allocated to its debate.

==United States==
===History===

On 8 March 1917, during World War I, a rule allowing cloture of debate was adopted by the Senate by a vote of 76–3 at the urging of President Woodrow Wilson, after a group of 12 anti-war senators managed to kill a bill that would have allowed Wilson to arm merchant vessels in the face of unrestricted German submarine warfare. This effort was led by Republican Senators Henry Cabot Lodge and Charles Curtis. This was successfully invoked for the first time on 15 November 1919, during the 66th Congress, to end a filibuster on the Treaty of Versailles.

The Senate&#x27;s rules originally required a supermajority of two-thirds of all senators present and voting to invoke cloture. For example, if all 100 senators voted on a cloture motion, 67 affirmative votes were required to invoke cloture; however, if some senators were absent and only 80 senators voted, only 54 would have to vote in favor. In the early years of the cloture rule, it proved very difficult to achieve this. The Senate tried 11 times between 1927 and 1962 to invoke cloture but failed each time. Filibuster use was particularly heavy by Democratic senators from southern states to block civil rights legislation.

In 1975, the Democratic Senate majority, having achieved a net gain of four seats in the 1974 Senate elections to attain a strength of 61 (with an additional independent senator caucusing with them for a total of 62), reduced the necessary supermajority to three-fifths of senators duly chosen and sworn. In practice, most bills cannot become law without the support of 60 senators.

Under the Senate rules and precedents, certain questions are nondebatable or debate time on them is limited, most notably bills considered under the reconciliation procedure or joint resolutions providing for congressional disapproval. Therefore, these measures cannot be filibustered and are not subjected to the supermajority cloture threshold. Although filing cloture on nondebatable measures is redundant, it has been done on occasion.

On November 21, 2013, after many of President Barack Obama&#x27;s nominees had been filibustered (most notably, Republicans refused to confirm any nominees to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit), Majority Leader Harry Reid raised a point of order that the threshold for invoking cloture on nominations, other than those to the Supreme Court of the United States, is a simple majority. The presiding officer overruled the point of order. The ruling of the chair was overruled by the Senate by a vote of 48–52, with all Republicans, as well as Democratic Senators Carl Levin, Joe Manchin and Mark Pryor, voting in favor of sustaining the decision of the chair. On April 6, 2017, following the filibuster of Neil Gorsuch&#x27;s nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell raised a point of order that the 2013 precedent also applied to Supreme Court nominations. The presiding officer overruled the point of order. The ruling of the chair was overturned by the Senate by a vote of 48–52, with all Democrats voting to sustain the decision of the chair. As a result of these two precedents, the threshold for invoking cloture on nominations is now a simple majority.

In the United States House of Representatives, the equivalent motion is the previous question.

===Procedure===

The procedure for invoking cloture is as follows:
* A minimum of 16 senators must sign a cloture motion that states, &quot;We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring to a close debate on [the measure].&quot;
* Any senator (generally the majority leader) may present the cloture motion at any time (including while another senator is speaking) while the question to which the cloture motion is directed is pending.
* The Senate then often moves on to other business.
* One hour after the Senate convenes on the second calendar day of session following the filing of the cloture motion (or at a time designated by unanimous consent), the cloture motion ripens, and the presiding officer directs the clerk to report the cloture motion.
* The presiding officer directs the clerk to call the roll to ascertain the presence of a quorum. In practice, this mandatory quorum call is almost always waived by unanimous consent.
* The presiding officer puts to the Senate the question, &quot;Is it the sense of the Senate that debate shall be brought to a close?&quot;
* The Senate votes on the cloture motion by the yeas and nays. A majority of three-fifths of senators duly chosen and sworn (60 votes if there is no more than one vacancy in the Senate) is required for most questions. A two-thirds majority of senators present and voting is required to invoke cloture on a motion or resolution to amend the Standing Rules of the Senate. Under the precedents set by the Senate on November 21, 2013, and April 6, 2017, a simple majority of senators present and voting is required to invoke cloture on nominations.

After cloture is invoked, the Senate automatically proceeds to consider the measure on which cloture was invoked (if it was not before the Senate already).
The following restrictions apply:
* The clotured measure remains the unfinished business to the exclusion of all other business until disposed of.
* No senator may speak for more than one hour. A senator may yield part or all of their one hour to a floor manager or leader, who may in turn yield that time to other senators. (No manager nor leader may have more than two hours yielded to them by another senator.)
* The two-speech rule does not apply.
* Senators may yield back part or all of their one hour; however, this yielding does not reduce the total time available for consideration of the measure.
* No senator may propose more than two amendments until every senator has had the opportunity to do the same.
* No amendment may be proposed unless it had been submitted in writing to the journal clerk by 1 o&#x27;clock p.m. on the day following the filing of the cloture motion in the case of a first-degree amendment or one hour prior to the beginning of the cloture vote in the case of a second-degree amendment.
* All amendments must be germane.
* Senators may continue to offer amendments even if their time for debate has expired.
* No dilatory motions or quorum calls are in order.
* After 30 hours of debate on the measure, the presiding officer puts the question on any pending amendments and the clotured measure. (Under the precedent set on April 3, 2019, post-cloture time on all nominations, other than those to the Supreme Court of the United States, those to the United States courts of appeals and those to a position at Level I of the Executive Schedule, is two hours.)
* Once post-cloture time has expired, the only motions in order are motions to reconsider and motions to table. One quorum call may also be demanded by a senator. Any senator who has not used nor yielded back ten minutes is guaranteed such time to speak to the measure.

Under rule XXII, paragraph 3 (added on January 24, 2013), a cloture motion signed by 16 senators (including the majority leader, minority leader, 7 other majority senators and 7 other minority senators) presented on a motion to proceed ripens one hour after the Senate convenes on the following calendar day. If cloture is invoked, the motion to proceed is not debatable.

Under rule XXVIII, paragraph 2 (added on January 24, 2013), a cloture motion on a compound motion to go to conference ripens two hours after it is filed. If cloture is invoked, the compound motion is not debatable.

<text>Adamant in classical mythology is an archaic form of diamond. In fact, the English word &quot;diamond&quot; is ultimately derived from &quot;adamas&quot;, via Late Latin and Old French . In ancient Greek (), genitive (), literally &#x27;unconquerable, untameable&#x27;. In those days, the qualities of hard metal (probably steel) were attributed to it, and &quot;adamant&quot; became an independent concept as a result.

In the Middle Ages adamant also became confused with the magnetic rock lodestone, and a folk etymology connected it with the Latin , &#x27;to love or be attached to&#x27;. Another connection was the belief that adamant (the diamond definition) could block the effects of a magnet. This was addressed in chapter III of &quot;Pseudodoxia Epidemica&quot;, for instance.

Since the contemporary word &quot;diamond&quot; is now used for the hardest gemstone, the increasingly archaic noun &quot;adamant&quot; has been reduced to mostly poetic or anachronistic use. In that capacity, the name, and various derivatives of it, are frequently used in modern media to refer to a variety of fictional substances.

==In mythology==
* Adamant is used as a translation in the King James Bible in Ezekiel 3:9 for the word (Shamir), the original word in the Hebrew Bible. 
* In Greek mythology, Cronus castrated his father Uranus using an adamant sickle given to him by his mother Gaia. An adamantine sickle or sword was also used by the hero Perseus to decapitate the Gorgon Medusa while she slept.
* In the Greek tragedy &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; (translated by G. M. Cookson), Hephaestus is to bind Prometheus &quot;to the jagged rocks in adamantine bonds infrangible&quot;.
* In Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot;, the gate of Tartarus is framed with pillars of solid adamant, &quot;that no might of man, nay, not even the sons of heaven, could uproot in war&quot;
* In John Milton&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, adamant or adamantine is mentioned eight times. First in Book 1, Satan is hurled &quot;to bottomless perdition, there to dwell in adamantine chains and penal fire&quot; (lines 47–48). Three times in Book 2 the gates of hell are described as being made of adamantine (lines 436, 646 and 853). In Book 6, Satan &quot;Came towring [&quot;sic&quot;], armd [&quot;sic&quot;] in Adamant and Gold&quot; (line 110), his shield is described as &quot;of tenfold adamant&quot; (line 255), and the armor worn by the fallen angels is described as &quot;adamantine&quot; (line 542). Finally in book 10 the metaphorical &quot;Pinns [&quot;sic&quot;] of Adamant and Chains&quot; (lines 318–319) bind the world to Satan, and thus to sin and death.
* In some versions of the Alexander Romance, Alexander the Great builds walls of Adamantine, the Gates of Alexander, to keep the giants Gog and Magog from pillaging the peaceful southern lands.
* In The Hypostasis of the Archons, Gnostic scripture from the Nag Hammadi Library refers to the Adamantine Land, an incorruptible place &#x27;above&#x27; from whence the spirit came to dwell within man so that he became Adam, he who moves upon the ground with a living soul.

==In popular culture== 

* In &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; by Dante, completed 1320, the angel at purgatory&#x27;s gate sits on adamant.
* In the Early Modern epic poem &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, published 1590, Sir Artegal&#x27;s sword is made of Adamant.
* In the Holy Sonnet I, published 1620, John Donne states in line 14, &quot;And thou like adamant draw mine iron heart&quot;.
* In &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; by Jonathan Swift, the base of the fictitious flying island of Laputa (Part III of Gulliver&#x27;s Travels) is constructed of Adamant.
* In J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Nenya, one of the Three Rings of Power, is set with a gem of adamant; the fortress of Barad-dûr is also partly built from &quot;adamant&quot;. The crown of Gondor is described as having &quot;seven gems of adamant&quot;.
* In the tabletop roleplaying game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, Adamantine is an exotic metal of great strength. 
* In &quot;His Dark Materials&quot; by Philip Pullman, in the third book, &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot; (2000), Lord Asriel&#x27;s tower is made of adamant.

<text>Rivendell (&quot;&quot;) is a valley in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s fictional world of Middle-earth, representing both a homely place of sanctuary and a magical Elvish otherworld. It is an important location in &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, being the place where the quest to destroy the One Ring began.

Rivendell&#x27;s feeling of peace may have contributed to the popularity of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; during the war-troubled 1960s. Scholars have noted that Rivendell was the home of Elvish song, from the hymn to Elbereth, recalling Tolkien&#x27;s Catholicism, to the complex Song of Eärendil with its multiple poetic devices. Others have written that it resembles the Celtic Otherworld of Tír na nÓg; and that it physically recalls the valley of Lauterbrunnen in Switzerland where Tolkien had gone hiking in 1911.

== Etymology ==

&quot;Rivendell&quot; is a direct translation or calque into English of the Sindarin Imladris, both meaning &quot;deep valley&quot;. The name Rivendell is formed by two English elements: &quot;riven&quot; (split, cloven) and &quot;dell&quot; (valley). Imladris was rendered &quot;Karningul&quot; in Westron, the &quot;Common Tongue&quot; of Middle-earth represented as English in the text of &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot; The house of Elrond in Rivendell is also called &quot;The Last Homely House East of the Sea,&quot; alluding to the wilderness (Rhovanion) that lies east of the Misty Mountains.

== Fiction ==

=== Geography ===
Rivendell lay in eastern Eriador at the edge of a narrow gorge of the river Bruinen (one of the main approaches to Rivendell comes from the nearby Ford of Bruinen), well hidden in the moorlands and foothills of the &quot;Hithaeglir&quot; or Misty Mountains. Contrary to the map of western Middle-earth published in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, the Great East Road did not, in Tolkien&#x27;s view, lead through Rivendell: Rivendell was maintained as a hidden valley away from the road to the High Pass. Like Hobbiton, it is at about the same latitude as Tolkien&#x27;s workplace, Oxford.

=== History ===

Rivendell was founded in the Second Age after the dark lord Sauron&#x27;s destruction of the Elvish land of Eregion. Rivendell remained as the only Elven settlement in eastern Eriador; Gil-galad gave Elrond the Ring Vilya, providing him with the power to protect Rivendell and slow the passage of time in its hidden valley: indeed, Rivendell kept its own calendar. Rivendell survived repeated attacks in the Third Age by the armies of the Witch-king of Angmar. Rivendell held the heirlooms of the Rangers of the North from the lost kingdom of Arnor, including the shards of Elendil&#x27;s sword Narsil, the Sceptre of Annúminas, and the Star of Elendil. Elrond fostered the children of the heirs to Arnor&#x27;s throne, the last being Aragorn. While in Rivendell, Aragorn met and fell in love with Elrond&#x27;s daughter, Arwen. They were married after he was crowned king of both Gondor and Arnor. Sauron&#x27;s enemies including Elrond formed the White Council, which met in Rivendell, as when the Council decided to eject the Necromancer from his fortress in Dol Guldur. The protagonists of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; take advice from Elrond in Rivendell. The protagonists of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; meet in Rivendell, attend the Council of Elrond, and decide on the quest to destroy the One Ring. The hero Aragorn&#x27;s sword is reforged as Andúril by Rivendell&#x27;s smiths. When the One Ring is destroyed, Elrond&#x27;s ring loses its power, and he leaves to sail for Valinor.

==Analysis==

=== Physical origins ===
The Rivendell valley is based upon the valley of Lauterbrunnen in Switzerland, where Tolkien had gone hiking. Tolkien stated directly that &quot;From Rivendell to the other side of the Misty Mountains, the journey ... including the glissade [of Bilbo and the Dwarves] down the slithering stones into the pine woods ... is based on my adventures in Switzerland in 1911&quot;.

The medievalist Marjorie Burns writes that Bilbo&#x27;s approach to Rivendell parallels the early fantasy writer and translator of Norse legend William Morris&#x27;s approach through the wilds of Iceland to a place he called &quot;Water-dale&quot; (&quot;Vatnsdale&quot;); both ride across uplands dotted with patches of green, becoming extremely tired; both then cross narrow ravines, and bogs; and both arrive at a hidden valley that offers shelter and comfort. In another place, Morris crosses a &quot;narrow, bridge-like rock&quot;, just as Bilbo faces a &quot;narrow bridge of stone without a parapet&quot; on entering Rivendell.

=== A place of sanctuary ===


Matthew T. Dickerson, in the &quot;J. R. R. Tolkien Encyclopedia&quot;, writes that Rivendell consistently represents a sanctuary, a place that felt like home, throughout the legendarium. 
The journalist Jane Ciabattari writes that a major reason for the popularity of &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; was the desire for escape among the Vietnam War generation. She compares the military-industrial complex with Mordor, and suggests that they yearned for a place of peace, just as Frodo Baggins felt an &quot;overwhelming longing to rest and remain at peace… in Rivendell&quot;.
Burns writes that Rivendell and the other Elvish realm of Lothlórien parallel the Celtic Otherworld (in Irish, Tír na nÓg), being hard to find, but if one is admitted and welcomed, one crosses a river, symbolising the spiritual transition from the ordinary realm, and &quot;the weary adventurer is transported into a haven of Elven hospitality and delight&quot;. There are multiple markers of the transition:

Burns notes that both &quot;Riven&quot; and &quot;dell&quot; suggest a low place into which one must descend; and that a descent is characteristic of Celtic tales of entry into the underground realm of the Tuatha Dé Danann, whose chiefs each rule a burial mound.

=== Heroic quest&#x27;s starting-point ===

The philologist and Tolkien scholar Tom Shippey remarks that Tolkien, a Christian, was extremely careful with dates and timelines, but that hardly any readers notice that the Fellowship sets out from Rivendell on its quest on 25 December, the date of Christmas, and succeeds, destroying the Ring and causing the fall of Sauron, on 25 March, the date in Anglo-Saxon tradition for the Crucifixion.

The Tolkien scholar Verlyn Flieger writes that both Frodo and Aragorn receive their renewed magic swords in Rivendell, marking them out as heroes in the epic tradition of Sigurd and Arthur, at the start of their quest.

=== Cultural allusions ===
Shippey contrasts the versions of the &quot;Old Walking Song&quot; sung by Bilbo and Frodo. Bilbo follows the &quot;Road ... with eager feet&quot;, hoping to reach the peace of Rivendell, to retire and take his ease; whereas Frodo sings &quot;with weary feet&quot;, hoping somehow to reach Mordor bearing the Ring, and to try to destroy it in the Cracks of Doom: diametrically opposed destinations and errands. He notes that Rivendell was the home of Elvish song, and cites Tolkien&#x27;s statement that the song that the Hobbits hear in Rivendell, &quot;A Elbereth Gilthoniel&quot; invoking the semi-divine Varda, was a hymn suggestive of his own devout Catholicism. Shippey writes, too, that Tolkien had Bilbo write and sing the Song of Earendil in Rivendell, making use of multiple poetic devices – rhyme, internal half-rhyme, alliteration, alliterative assonance, and &quot;a frequent if irregular variation of syntax&quot; – to create a mysterious Elvish effect of &quot;rich and continuous uncertainty, a pattern forever being glimpsed but never quite grasped.&quot; Rebecca Ankeny comments that Tolkien uses verse, too, to signal the horror of the Elves when Gandalf speaks the dark lord&#x27;s rhyme of the Rings aloud, in the Black Speech, threatening the end of Rivendell.

The Tolkien scholar Gergely Nagy notes that Tolkien wanted to present the complex set of writings of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; as a seemingly-genuine collection of tales and myths within the frame of his fictional Middle-earth; he modified &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; to ascribe the documents to Bilbo, supposedly written in the years he spent in Rivendell, and preserved in the fictitious &quot;Red Book of Westmarch&quot;, its name alluding to the &quot;Red Book of Hergest&quot;.

Burns writes that Rivendell, &quot;the Last Homely House&quot;, offers a welcoming home, repeating the pattern set in both &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; of &quot;easy-going but tidy bachelor indulgence&quot; from Bilbo&#x27;s Bag End hobbit-hole onwards; despite Arwen, there is hardly anything &quot;of the feminine&quot;. Shippey states that Frodo has &quot;to be dug out ... of no fewer than five &#x27;Homely Houses&#x27;&quot;, of which Rivendell is the last.

==Adaptations==

In Peter Jackson&#x27;s 2001 film &quot;The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, Rivendell was represented by Kaitoke Regional Park, New Zealand, though the waterfalls were added with computer-generated imagery. Brian Rosebury comments that Jackson presents the Elves as sophisticated, where Tolkien made them close to nature. All the same, he writes, the film Rivendell&#x27;s &quot;architecture and ornaments are dominated by natural motifs&quot;, suggesting &quot;integration with nature, but at one remove&quot;, something that works well for the &quot;Portmeirion-like idyll&quot; of the portrayed Rivendell. Rosebury describes the design as &quot;post-Ruskinian&quot;, as in pre-Raphaelite paintings, William Morris&#x27;s Arts and Crafts designs, and Art Nouveau architectural details. These differ from Tolkien&#x27;s own illustrations, but in a way, Rosebury suggests, that Tolkien would have liked as it matches his dislike of industrialised manufacture.

==Legacy==

In the period of counterculture in the Western world of the 1960s and 1970s, a commune called &quot;Maos Lyst&quot; (Mao&#x27;s Delight) was founded on the island of Zealand, Denmark, in 1968, its inhabitants replacing their surnames with &quot;Kløvedal&quot;, the Danish for Rivendell. Several of them later became well-known cultural personalities in the country. 
The Rivendell Winery operated from 1987 to 2008 in New York&#x27;s Hudson River Valley. 
The Tolkien Ensemble set all the songs in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; to music on four CDs between 1997 and 2005, each with &quot;Rivendell&quot; in its title. The Swedish classical composer Anna-Lena Laurin has written a work for two guitars entitled &quot;Rivendell&quot;.
The Canadian progressive rock band Rush memorialised the Elvish sanctuary in the song &quot;Rivendell&quot; on their 1975 studio album &quot;Fly by Night&quot;. The song focuses on the tranquillity and seemingly endless time a weary traveller could find there, with lyrics such as &quot;Elfin songs and endless nights / Sweet wine and soft relaxing lights / Time will never touch you / Here in this enchanted place&quot;.

<text>Meta-analysis is a method of synthesis of quantitative data from multiple independent studies addressing a common research question. An important part of this method involves computing a combined effect size across all of the studies. As such, this statistical approach involves extracting effect sizes and variance measures from various studies. By combining these effect sizes the statistical power is improved and can resolve uncertainties or discrepancies found in individual studies. Meta-analyses are integral in supporting research grant proposals, shaping treatment guidelines, and influencing health policies. They are also pivotal in summarizing existing research to guide future studies, thereby cementing their role as a fundamental methodology in metascience. Meta-analyses are often, but not always, important components of a systematic review.

==History==

The term &quot;meta-analysis&quot; was coined in 1976 by the statistician Gene Glass, who stated &quot;Meta-analysis refers to the analysis of analyses&quot;. Glass&#x27;s work aimed at describing aggregated measures of relationships and effects. While Glass is credited with authoring the first modern meta-analysis, a paper published in 1904 by the statistician Karl Pearson in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; collated data from several studies of typhoid inoculation and is seen as the first time a meta-analytic approach was used to aggregate the outcomes of multiple clinical studies. Numerous other examples of early meta-analyses can be found including occupational aptitude testing, and agriculture.

The first model meta-analysis was published in 1978 on the effectiveness of psychotherapy outcomes by Mary Lee Smith and Gene Glass. After publication of their article there was pushback on the usefulness and validity of meta-analysis as a tool for evidence synthesis. The first example of this was by Hans Eysenck who in a 1978 article in response to the work done by Mary Lee Smith and Gene Glass called meta-analysis an &quot;exercise in mega-silliness&quot;. Later Eysenck would refer to meta-analysis as &quot;statistical alchemy&quot;. Despite these criticisms the use of meta-analysis has only grown since its modern introduction. By 1991 there were 334 published meta-analyses; this number grew to 9,135 by 2014.

The field of meta-analysis expanded greatly since the 1970s and touches multiple disciplines including psychology, medicine, and ecology. Further the more recent creation of evidence synthesis communities has increased the cross pollination of ideas, methods, and the creation of software tools across disciplines.

== Literature Search ==
One of the most important steps of a meta-analysis is data collection. For an efficient database search, appropriate keywords and search limits need to be identified. The use of Boolean operators and search limits can assist the literature search. A number of databases are available (e.g., PubMed, Embase, PsychInfo), however, it is up to the researcher to choose the most appropriate sources for their research area. Indeed, many scientists use duplicate search terms within two or more databases to cover multiple sources. The reference lists of eligible studies can also be searched for eligible studies (i.e., snowballing). The initial search may return a large volume of studies. Quite often, the abstract or the title of the manuscript reveals that the study is not eligible for inclusion, based on the pre-specified criteria. These studies can be discarded. However, if it appears that the study may be eligible (or even if there is some doubt) the full paper can be retained for closer inspection. The references lists of eligible articles can also be searched for any relevant articles. These search results need to be detailed in a PRIMSA flow diagram which details the flow of information through all stages of the review. Thus, it is important to note how many studies were returned after using the specified search terms and how many of these studies were discarded, and for what reason. The search terms and strategy should be specific enough for a reader to reproduce the search. The date range of studies, along with the date (or date period) the search was conducted should also be provided.

A data collection form provides a standardized means of collecting data from eligible studies. For a meta-analysis of correlational data, effect size information is usually collected as Pearson&#x27;s &quot;r&quot; statistic. Partial correlations are often reported in research, however, these may inflate relationships in comparison to zero-order correlations. Moreover, the partialed out variables will likely vary from study-to-study. As a consequence, many meta-analyses exclude partial correlations from their analysis. As a final resort, plot digitizers can be used to scrape data points from scatterplots (if available) for the calculation of Pearson&#x27;s &quot;r&quot;. Data reporting important study characteristics that may moderate effects, such as the mean age of participants, should also be collected. A measure of study quality can also be included in these forms to assess the quality of evidence from each study. There are more than 80 tools available to assess the quality and risk of bias in observational studies reflecting the diversity of research approaches between fields. These tools usually include an assessment of how dependent variables were measured, appropriate selection of participants, and appropriate control for confounding factors. Other quality measures that may be more relevant for correlational studies include sample size, psychometric properties, and reporting of methods.

A final consideration is whether to include studies from the gray literature, which is defined as research that has not been formally published. This type of literature includes conference abstracts, dissertations, and pre-prints. While the inclusion of gray literature reduces the risk of publication bias, the methodological quality of the work is often (but not always) lower than formally published work. Reports from conference proceedings, which are the most common source of gray literature, are poorly reported and data in the subsequent publication is often inconsistent, with differences observed in almost 20% of published studies.

==Methods and assumptions==

===Approaches===
In general, two types of evidence can be distinguished when performing a meta-analysis: individual participant data (IPD), and aggregate data (AD). The aggregate data can be direct or indirect.

AD is more commonly available (e.g. from the literature) and typically represents summary estimates such as odds ratios or relative risks. This can be directly synthesized across conceptually similar studies using several approaches. On the other hand, indirect aggregate data measures the effect of two treatments that were each compared against a similar control group in a meta-analysis. For example, if treatment A and treatment B were directly compared vs placebo in separate meta-analyses, we can use these two pooled results to get an estimate of the effects of A vs B in an indirect comparison as effect A vs Placebo minus effect B vs Placebo.

IPD evidence represents raw data as collected by the study centers. This distinction has raised the need for different meta-analytic methods when evidence synthesis is desired, and has led to the development of one-stage and two-stage methods. In one-stage methods the IPD from all studies are modeled simultaneously whilst accounting for the clustering of participants within studies. Two-stage methods first compute summary statistics for AD from each study and then calculate overall statistics as a weighted average of the study statistics. By reducing IPD to AD, two-stage methods can also be applied when IPD is available; this makes them an appealing choice when performing a meta-analysis. Although it is conventionally believed that one-stage and two-stage methods yield similar results, recent studies have shown that they may occasionally lead to different conclusions.

===Statistical models for aggregate data===

==== Fixed effect model ====

The fixed effect model provides a weighted average of a series of study estimates. The inverse of the estimates&#x27; variance is commonly used as study weight, so that larger studies tend to contribute more than smaller studies to the weighted average. Consequently, when studies within a meta-analysis are dominated by a very large study, the findings from smaller studies are practically ignored. Most importantly, the fixed effects model assumes that all included studies investigate the same population, use the same variable and outcome definitions, etc. This assumption is typically unrealistic as research is often prone to several sources of heterogeneity.

If we start with a collection of independent effect size estimates, each estimate a corresponding effect size formula_1 we can assume that formula_2 where formula_3 denotes the observed effect in the formula_4-th study, formula_5 the corresponding (unknown) true effect, formula_6 is the sampling error, and formula_7. Therefore, the formula_3’s are assumed to be unbiased and normally distributed estimates of their corresponding true effects. The sampling variances (i.e., formula_9 values) are assumed to be known.

==== Random effects model ====

Most meta-analyses are based on sets of studies that are not exactly identical in their methods and/or the characteristics of the included samples. Differences in the methods and sample characteristics may introduce variability (“heterogeneity”) among the true effects. One way to model the heterogeneity is to treat it as purely random. The weight that is applied in this process of weighted averaging with a random effects meta-analysis is achieved in two steps:

# Step 1: Inverse variance weighting
# Step 2: Un-weighting of this inverse variance weighting by applying a random effects variance component (REVC) that is simply derived from the extent of variability of the effect sizes of the underlying studies.

This means that the greater this variability in effect sizes (otherwise known as heterogeneity), the greater the un-weighting and this can reach a point when the random effects meta-analysis result becomes simply the un-weighted average effect size across the studies. At the other extreme, when all effect sizes are similar (or variability does not exceed sampling error), no REVC is applied and the random effects meta-analysis defaults to simply a fixed effect meta-analysis (only inverse variance weighting).

The extent of this reversal is solely dependent on two factors:

# Heterogeneity of precision
# Heterogeneity of effect size

Since neither of these factors automatically indicates a faulty larger study or more reliable smaller studies, the re-distribution of weights under this model will not bear a relationship to what these studies actually might offer. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that redistribution of weights is simply in one direction from larger to smaller studies as heterogeneity increases until eventually all studies have equal weight and no more redistribution is possible.
Another issue with the random effects model is that the most commonly used confidence intervals generally do not retain their coverage probability above the specified nominal level and thus substantially underestimate the statistical error and are potentially
overconfident in their conclusions. Several fixes have been suggested but the debate continues on. A further concern is that the average treatment effect can sometimes be even less conservative compared to the fixed effect model and therefore misleading in practice. One interpretational fix that has been suggested is to create a prediction interval around the random effects estimate to portray the range of possible effects in practice. However, an assumption behind the calculation of such a prediction interval is that trials are considered more or less homogeneous entities and that included patient populations and comparator treatments should be considered exchangeable and this is usually unattainable in practice.

There are many methods used to estimate between studies variance with restricted maximum likelihood estimator being the least prone to bias and one of the most commonly used. Several advanced iterative techniques for computing the between studies variance exist including both maximum likelihood and restricted maximum likelihood methods and random effects models using these methods can be run with multiple software platforms including Excel, Stata, SPSS, and R.

Most meta-analyses include between 2 and 4 studies and such a sample is more often than not inadequate to accurately estimate heterogeneity. Thus it appears that in small meta-analyses, an incorrect zero between study variance estimate is obtained, leading to a false homogeneity assumption. Overall, it appears that heterogeneity is being consistently underestimated in meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses in which high heterogeneity levels are assumed could be informative. These random effects models and software packages mentioned above relate to study-aggregate meta-analyses and researchers wishing to conduct individual patient data (IPD) meta-analyses need to consider mixed-effects modelling approaches./

==== Quality effects model ====

Doi and Thalib originally introduced the quality effects model. They introduced a new approach to adjustment for inter-study variability by incorporating the contribution of variance due to a relevant component (quality) in addition to the contribution of variance due to random error that is used in any fixed effects meta-analysis model to generate weights for each study. The strength of the quality effects meta-analysis is that it allows available methodological evidence to be used over subjective random effects, and thereby helps to close the damaging gap which has opened up between methodology and statistics in clinical research. To do this a synthetic bias variance is computed based on quality information to adjust inverse variance weights and the quality adjusted weight of the &quot;i&quot;th study is introduced. These adjusted weights are then used in meta-analysis. In other words, if study &quot;i&quot; is of good quality and other studies are of poor quality, a proportion of their quality adjusted weights is mathematically redistributed to study &quot;i&quot; giving it more weight towards the overall effect size. As studies become increasingly similar in terms of quality, re-distribution becomes progressively less and ceases when all studies are of equal quality (in the case of equal quality, the quality effects model defaults to the IVhet model – see previous section). A recent evaluation of the quality effects model (with some updates) demonstrates that despite the subjectivity of quality assessment, the performance (MSE and true variance under simulation) is superior to that achievable with the random effects model. This model thus replaces the untenable interpretations that abound in the literature and a software is available to explore this method further.

==== Network meta-analysis methods ====
Indirect comparison meta-analysis methods (also called network meta-analyses, in particular when multiple treatments are assessed simultaneously) generally use two main methodologies. First, is the Bucher method which is a single or repeated comparison of a closed loop of three-treatments such that one of them is common to the two studies and forms the node where the loop begins and ends. Therefore, multiple two-by-two comparisons (3-treatment loops) are needed to compare multiple treatments. This methodology requires that trials with more than two arms have two arms only selected as independent pair-wise comparisons are required. The alternative methodology uses complex statistical modelling to include the multiple arm trials and comparisons simultaneously between all competing treatments. These have been executed using Bayesian methods, mixed linear models and meta-regression approaches.

=====Bayesian framework=====
Specifying a Bayesian network meta-analysis model involves writing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) model for general-purpose Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) software such as WinBUGS. In addition, prior distributions have to be specified for a number of the parameters, and the data have to be supplied in a specific format. Together, the DAG, priors, and data form a Bayesian hierarchical model. To complicate matters further, because of the nature of MCMC estimation, overdispersed starting values have to be chosen for a number of independent chains so that convergence can be assessed. Recently, multiple R software packages were developed to simplify the model fitting (e.g., &quot;metaBMA&quot; and &quot;RoBMA&quot;) and even implemented in statistical software with graphical user interface (GUI): JASP. Although the complexity of the Bayesian approach limits usage of this methodology, recent tutorial papers are trying to increase accessibility of the methods. Methodology for automation of this method has been suggested but requires that arm-level outcome data are available, and this is usually unavailable. Great claims are sometimes made for the inherent ability of the Bayesian framework to handle network meta-analysis and its greater flexibility. However, this choice of implementation of framework for inference, Bayesian or frequentist, may be less important than other choices regarding the modeling of effects (see discussion on models above).

=====Frequentist multivariate framework=====
On the other hand, the frequentist multivariate methods involve approximations and assumptions that are not stated explicitly or verified when the methods are applied (see discussion on meta-analysis models above). For example, the mvmeta package for Stata enables network meta-analysis in a frequentist framework. However, if there is no common comparator in the network, then this has to be handled by augmenting the dataset with fictional arms with high variance, which is not very objective and requires a decision as to what constitutes a sufficiently high variance. The other issue is use of the random effects model in both this frequentist framework and the Bayesian framework. Senn advises analysts to be cautious about interpreting the &#x27;random effects&#x27; analysis since only one random effect is allowed for but one could envisage many. Senn goes on to say that it is rather naıve, even in the case where only two treatments are being compared to assume that random-effects analysis accounts for all uncertainty about the way effects can vary from trial to trial. Newer models of meta-analysis such as those discussed above would certainly help alleviate this situation and have been implemented in the next framework.

=====Generalized pairwise modelling framework=====
An approach that has been tried since the late 1990s is the implementation of the multiple three-treatment closed-loop analysis. This has not been popular because the process rapidly becomes overwhelming as network complexity increases. Development in this area was then abandoned in favor of the Bayesian and multivariate frequentist methods which emerged as alternatives. Very recently, automation of the three-treatment closed loop method has been developed for complex networks by some researchers as a way to make this methodology available to the mainstream research community. This proposal does restrict each trial to two interventions, but also introduces a workaround for multiple arm trials: a different fixed control node can be selected in different runs. It also utilizes robust meta-analysis methods so that many of the problems highlighted above are avoided. Further research around this framework is required to determine if this is indeed superior to the Bayesian or multivariate frequentist frameworks. Researchers willing to try this out have access to this framework through a free software.

=====Tailored meta-analysis=====
Another form of additional information comes from the intended setting. If the target setting for applying the meta-analysis results is known then it may be possible to use data from the setting to tailor the results thus producing a &#x27;tailored meta-analysis&#x27;., This has been used in test accuracy meta-analyses, where empirical knowledge of the test positive rate and the prevalence have been used to derive a region in Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) space known as an &#x27;applicable region&#x27;. Studies are then selected for the target setting based on comparison with this region and aggregated to produce a summary estimate which is tailored to the target setting.

==== Aggregating IPD and AD ====
Meta-analysis can also be applied to combine IPD and AD. This is convenient when the researchers who conduct the analysis have their own raw data while collecting aggregate or summary data from the literature. The generalized integration model (GIM) is a generalization of the meta-analysis. It allows that the model fitted on the individual participant data (IPD) is different from the ones used to compute the aggregate data (AD). GIM can be viewed as a model calibration method for integrating information with more flexibility.

===Validation of meta-analysis results===
The meta-analysis estimate represents a weighted average across studies and when there is heterogeneity this may result in the summary estimate not being representative of individual studies. Qualitative appraisal of the primary studies using established tools can uncover potential biases, but does not quantify the aggregate effect of these biases on the summary estimate. Although the meta-analysis result could be compared with an independent prospective primary study, such external validation is often impractical. This has led to the development of methods that exploit a form of leave-one-out cross validation, sometimes referred to as internal-external cross validation (IOCV). Here each of the k included studies in turn is omitted and compared with the summary estimate derived from aggregating the remaining k- 1 studies. A general validation statistic, Vn based on IOCV has been developed to measure the statistical validity of meta-analysis results. For test accuracy and prediction, particularly when there are multivariate effects, other approaches which seek to estimate the prediction error have also been proposed.

==Challenges==

A meta-analysis of several small studies does not always predict the results of a single large study. Some have argued that a weakness of the method is that sources of bias are not controlled by the method: a good meta-analysis cannot correct for poor design or bias in the original studies. This would mean that only methodologically sound studies should be included in a meta-analysis, a practice called &#x27;best evidence synthesis&#x27;. Other meta-analysts would include weaker studies, and add a study-level predictor variable that reflects the methodological quality of the studies to examine the effect of study quality on the effect size. However, others have argued that a better approach is to preserve information about the variance in the study sample, casting as wide a net as possible, and that methodological selection criteria introduce unwanted subjectivity, defeating the purpose of the approach. More recently, and under the influence of a push for open practices in science, tools to develop &quot;crowd-sourced&quot; living meta-analyses that are updated by communities of scientists in hopes of making all the subjective choices more explicit.

===Publication bias: the file drawer problem===
Another potential pitfall is the reliance on the available body of published studies, which may create exaggerated outcomes due to publication bias, as studies which show negative results or insignificant results are less likely to be published. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been known to hide negative studies and researchers may have overlooked unpublished studies such as dissertation studies or conference abstracts that did not reach publication. This is not easily solved, as one cannot know how many studies have gone unreported.

This file drawer problem characterized by negative or non-significant results being tucked away in a cabinet, can result in a biased distribution of effect sizes thus creating a serious base rate fallacy, in which the significance of the published studies is overestimated, as other studies were either not submitted for publication or were rejected. This should be seriously considered when interpreting the outcomes of a meta-analysis.

The distribution of effect sizes can be visualized with a funnel plot which (in its most common version) is a scatter plot of standard error versus the effect size. It makes use of the fact that the smaller studies (thus larger standard errors) have more scatter of the magnitude of effect (being less precise) while the larger studies have less scatter and form the tip of the funnel. If many negative studies were not published, the remaining positive studies give rise to a funnel plot in which the base is skewed to one side (asymmetry of the funnel plot). In contrast, when there is no publication bias, the effect of the smaller studies has no reason to be skewed to one side and so a symmetric funnel plot results. This also means that if no publication bias is present, there would be no relationship between standard error and effect size. A negative or positive relation between standard error and effect size would imply that smaller studies that found effects in one direction only were more likely to be published and/or to be submitted for publication.

Apart from the visual funnel plot, statistical methods for detecting publication bias have also been proposed. These are controversial because they typically have low power for detection of bias, but also may make false positives under some circumstances. For instance small study effects (biased smaller studies), wherein methodological differences between smaller and larger studies exist, may cause asymmetry in effect sizes that resembles publication bias. However, small study effects may be just as problematic for the interpretation of meta-analyses, and the imperative is on meta-analytic authors to investigate potential sources of bias.

The problem of publication bias is not trivial as it is suggested that 25% of meta-analyses in the psychological sciences may have suffered from publication bias. However, low power of existing tests and problems with the visual appearance of the funnel plot remain an issue, and estimates of publication bias may remain lower than what truly exists.

Most discussions of publication bias focus on journal practices favoring publication of statistically significant findings. However, questionable research practices, such as reworking statistical models until significance is achieved, may also favor statistically significant findings in support of researchers&#x27; hypotheses.

===Problems related to studies not reporting non-statistically significant effects===

Studies often do not report the effects when they do not reach statistical significance. For example, they may simply say that the groups did not show statistically significant differences, without reporting any other information (e.g. a statistic or p-value). Exclusion of these studies would lead to a situation similar to publication bias, but their inclusion (assuming null effects) would also bias the meta-analysis.

===Problems related to the statistical approach===

Other weaknesses are that it has not been determined if the statistically most accurate method for combining results is the fixed, IVhet, random or quality effect models, though the criticism against the random effects model is mounting because of the perception that the new random effects (used in meta-analysis) are essentially formal devices to facilitate smoothing or shrinkage and prediction may be impossible or ill-advised. The main problem with the random effects approach is that it uses the classic statistical thought of generating a &quot;compromise estimator&quot; that makes the weights close to the naturally weighted estimator if heterogeneity across studies is large but close to the inverse variance weighted estimator if the between study heterogeneity is small. However, what has been ignored is the distinction between the model &quot;we choose&quot; to analyze a given dataset, and the &quot;mechanism by which the data came into being&quot;. A random effect can be present in either of these roles, but the two roles are quite distinct. There&#x27;s no reason to think the analysis model and data-generation mechanism (model) are similar in form, but many sub-fields of statistics have developed the habit of assuming, for theory and simulations, that the data-generation mechanism (model) is identical to the analysis model we choose (or would like others to choose). As a hypothesized mechanisms for producing the data, the random effect model for meta-analysis is silly and it is more appropriate to think of this model as a superficial description and something we choose as an analytical tool – but this choice for meta-analysis may not work because the study effects are a fixed feature of the respective meta-analysis and the probability distribution is only a descriptive tool.

===Problems arising from agenda-driven bias===

The most severe fault in meta-analysis often occurs when the person or persons doing the meta-analysis have an economic, social, or political agenda such as the passage or defeat of legislation. People with these types of agendas may be more likely to abuse meta-analysis due to personal bias. For example, researchers favorable to the author&#x27;s agenda are likely to have their studies cherry-picked while those not favorable will be ignored or labeled as &quot;not credible&quot;. In addition, the favored authors may themselves be biased or paid to produce results that support their overall political, social, or economic goals in ways such as selecting small favorable data sets and not incorporating larger unfavorable data sets. The influence of such biases on the results of a meta-analysis is possible because the methodology of meta-analysis is highly malleable.

A 2011 study done to disclose possible conflicts of interests in underlying research studies used for medical meta-analyses reviewed 29 meta-analyses and found that conflicts of interests in the studies underlying the meta-analyses were rarely disclosed. The 29 meta-analyses included 11 from general medicine journals, 15 from specialty medicine journals, and three from the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The 29 meta-analyses reviewed a total of 509 randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Of these, 318 RCTs reported funding sources, with 219 (69%) receiving funding from industry (i.e. one or more authors
having financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry). Of the 509 RCTs, 132 reported author conflict of interest disclosures, with 91 studies (69%) disclosing one or more authors having financial ties to industry. The information was, however, seldom reflected in the meta-analyses. Only two (7%) reported RCT funding sources and none reported RCT author-industry ties. The authors concluded &quot;without acknowledgment of COI due to industry funding or author industry financial ties from RCTs included in meta-analyses, readers&#x27; understanding and appraisal of the evidence from the meta-analysis may be compromised.&quot;

For example, in 1998, a US federal judge found that the United States Environmental Protection Agency had abused the meta-analysis process to produce a study claiming cancer risks to non-smokers from environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) with the intent to influence policy makers to pass smoke-free–workplace laws.

===Comparability and validity of included studies===
Meta-analysis may often not be a substitute for an adequately powered primary study, particularly in the biological sciences.

Heterogeneity of methods used may lead to faulty conclusions. For instance, differences in the forms of an intervention or the cohorts that are thought to be minor or are unknown to the scientists could lead to substantially different results, including results that distort the meta-analysis&#x27; results or are not adequately considered in its data. Vice versa, results from meta-analyses may also make certain hypothesis or interventions seem nonviable and preempt further research or approvals, despite certain modifications – such as intermittent administration, personalized criteria and combination measures – leading to substantially different results, including in cases where such have been successfully identified and applied in small-scale studies that were considered in the meta-analysis. Standardization, reproduction of experiments, open data and open protocols may often not mitigate such problems, for instance as relevant factors and criteria could be unknown or not be recorded.

There is a debate about the appropriate balance between testing with as few animals or humans as possible and the need to obtain robust, reliable findings. It has been argued that unreliable research is inefficient and wasteful and that studies are not just wasteful when they stop too late but also when they stop too early. In large clinical trials, planned, sequential analyses are sometimes used if there is considerable expense or potential harm associated with testing participants. In applied behavioural science, &quot;megastudies&quot; have been proposed to investigate the efficacy of many different interventions designed in an interdisciplinary manner by separate teams.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1038/s41586-021-04128-4&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One such study used a fitness chain to recruit a large number participants. It has been suggested that behavioural interventions are often hard to compare [in meta-analyses and reviews], as &quot;different scientists test different intervention ideas in different samples using different outcomes over different time intervals&quot;, causing a lack of comparability of such individual investigations which limits &quot;their potential to inform policy&quot;.

===Weak inclusion standards lead to misleading conclusions===

Meta-analyses in education are often not restrictive enough in regards to the methodological quality of the studies they include. For example, studies that include small samples or researcher-made measures lead to inflated effect size estimates. However, this problem also troubles meta-analysis of clinical trials. The use of different quality assessment tools (QATs) lead to including different studies and obtaining conflicting estimates of average treatment effects.

==Applications in modern science==
Modern statistical meta-analysis does more than just combine the effect sizes of a set of studies using a weighted average. It can test if the outcomes of studies show more variation than the variation that is expected because of the sampling of different numbers of research participants. Additionally, study characteristics such as measurement instrument used, population sampled, or aspects of the studies&#x27; design can be coded and used to reduce variance of the estimator (see statistical models above). Thus some methodological weaknesses in studies can be corrected statistically. Other uses of meta-analytic methods include the development and validation of clinical prediction models, where meta-analysis may be used to combine individual participant data from different research centers and to assess the model&#x27;s generalisability, or even to aggregate existing prediction models.

Meta-analysis can be done with single-subject design as well as group research designs. This is important because much research has been done with single-subject research designs. Considerable dispute exists for the most appropriate meta-analytic technique for single subject research.

Meta-analysis leads to a shift of emphasis from single studies to multiple studies. It emphasizes the practical importance of the effect size instead of the statistical significance of individual studies. This shift in thinking has been termed &quot;meta-analytic thinking&quot;. The results of a meta-analysis are often shown in a forest plot.

Results from studies are combined using different approaches. One approach frequently used in meta-analysis in health care research is termed &#x27;inverse variance method&#x27;. The average effect size across all studies is computed as a &quot;weighted mean&quot;, whereby the weights are equal to the inverse variance of each study&#x27;s effect estimator. Larger studies and studies with less random variation are given greater weight than smaller studies. Other common approaches include the Mantel–Haenszel method and the Peto method.

Seed-based d mapping (formerly signed differential mapping, SDM) is a statistical technique for meta-analyzing studies on differences in brain activity or structure which used neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI, VBM or PET.

Different high throughput techniques such as microarrays have been used to understand Gene expression. MicroRNA expression profiles have been used to identify differentially expressed microRNAs in particular cell or tissue type or disease conditions or to check the effect of a treatment. A meta-analysis of such expression profiles was performed to derive novel conclusions and to validate the known findings.

Meta-analysis of whole genome sequencing studies provides an attractive solution to the problem of collecting large sample sizes for discovering rare variants associated with complex phenotypes. Some methods have been developed to enable functionally informed rare variant association meta-analysis in biobank-scale cohorts using efficient approaches for summary statistic storage.

Sweeping meta-analyses can also be used to estimate a network of effects. This allows researchers to examine patterns in the fuller panorama of more accurately estimated results and draw conclusions that consider the broader context (e.g., how personality-intelligence relations vary by trait family).

<text>Adam Adamant Lives! is a British adventure television series that ran from 1966 to 1967 on BBC 1, starring Gerald Harper in the title role. The series was created and produced by several alumni from &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The titular character was an adventurer born in 1867, who had been revived from hibernation in 1966, thus offering a satirical look at life in the 1960s through the eyes of a Victorian. In 2020, Big Finish Productions reimagined the series as a Radio drama.

The main character originally went through a number of possible names: &quot;Cornelius Chance&quot;, &quot;Rupert De&#x27;Ath&quot;, &quot;Dick Daring&quot;, &quot;Dexter Noble&quot;, &quot;Aurelian Winton&quot;, &quot;Magnus Hawke&quot; and even &quot;Darius Crud&quot; before Sydney Newman settled on Adam Adamant, named after the generic mineral term adamantine which, since medieval times, has commonly referred to diamond. In the opening episode, &quot;A Vintage Year for Scoundrels&quot;, Adam Llewellyn De Vere Adamant is a swashbuckling Edwardian gentleman adventurer who, in 1902 (when Edward VII had been on the throne just one year), goes to rescue his kidnapped girlfriend Louise. In fact, he is lured into a trap, whereupon he is captured and condemned to be frozen forever in a block of ice by his nemesis, the Face, whose identity is concealed behind a leather mask and who speaks in a sinister whispering voice. The Face grants him one last request, and Adamant asks to see Louise; in his last moments of life before being frozen, he learns to his horror that Louise had faked her kidnapping and had been working for the Face all along.

Adamant is found in 1966, when a building is being knocked down, and he is revived. On emerging from a hospital and collapsing on the London streets, he is rescued by Georgina Jones and taken to her flat. Adamant immediately became embroiled in the criminal world of the 1960s when Georgina is threatened after almost being witness to the murder of her grandfather by protection racketeers at a disco. Though in many ways a typical swinging sixties woman, Georgina had grown up idolising Adamant through tales of his turn-of-the-century exploits. She tries to get involved with all his cases, despite his efforts to stop her, and often manages to get a job at the scene in question at a moment&#x27;s notice. The part was played by Ann Holloway in the untransmitted pilot episode, but was recast with Juliet Harmer as it was felt that Holloway&#x27;s performance did not fit the series. During the second episode, &quot;Death Has a Thousand Faces&quot;, the events of which are set in Blackpool, he acquires a manservant in the form of former music hall artiste and Punch and Judy man William E. Simms. The character was originally to have been played by John Dawson, who hurt his back lifting an actress during rehearsals for &quot;The Sweet Smell of Disaster&quot; and was unable to continue. The part was recast, going instead to Jack May.

Adamant is an expert swordsman, carrying a swordstick with which he cold-bloodedly kills any enemy who deserves it. John Steed of &quot;The Avengers&quot; and Lord Peter Wimsey used similar weapons. Adamant was a colonel, and a member of the volunteer strength of the 51st Yeomanry since 1895, though he is listed on their official records as being &quot;missing, presumed killed&quot; since 1902. He is also a good boxer, and occasionally demonstrates proficiency in jujitsu, which had been introduced to England several years before he was frozen.

Though there is no indication of where his money comes from or how he supports himself, Adamant rebuilt his old home, the long demolished 26A Albany Street, on the top of a multi-storey car park which he had bought at 17 Upper Thames Street in central London. It is accessed by a lift hidden on the other side of a sliding wall, activated from the outside by pressing a hidden call button. He also purchased a Mini Cooper S with the personalised number plate &quot;AA 1000&quot;. The car was a special conversion: a &quot;Mini de Ville&quot; by Harold Radford Coach Builder LTD. He occasionally does jobs for the British Government, as in &quot;More Deadly Than the Sword&quot;. When he is knocked unconscious, Adamant often dreams of how he was caught by the Face and Louise. He continues to be taken advantage of by women in the 1960s, owing to his out-of-time naïveté.

The Face returned to the show in the second series, beginning with the episode &quot;A Slight Case of Reincarnation&quot;. He joins Adamant in the present day, having also been frozen in 1902. His accomplice Louise aged naturally, watching over him during the intervening years, before reviving him. Throughout the second series The Face would assist Adamant&#x27;s antagonists, but routinely escaped before facing defeat himself. In the final episode, Adamant celebrates his 100th birthday in the final episode, &quot;A Sinister Sort of Service&quot;, receiving a telegram from the Queen.

== Production ==

=== Series development ===
&quot;Adam Adamant Lives!&quot; has been called by modern observers &quot;what &quot;Doctor Who&quot; did next&quot;, because at least three &quot;Doctor Who&quot; alumni had key positions on the pilot. It reunited producer Verity Lambert with Head of Television Drama Sydney Newman. Together they had been at the core of decision-makers who launched &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The series also brought Donald Cotton, who had the same year written two serials for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, back into Newman&#x27;s orbit. Cotton and partner Richard Harris would write the first script, &quot;A Vintage Year for Scoundrels&quot;, and would therefore come to be credited as co-creators. However, over the years, Newman has been cited as creator of the show. Even the BBC has at times propagated this idea, calling him the creator on some of their own pages devoted to the programme, but not on others.

&quot;Adam Adamant Lives!&quot; was a quick replacement for the show he had actually intended, an adaptation of the adventures of literary detective Sexton Blake. When the rights to the character suddenly became unavailable, it fell to writers Cotton and Harris, along with script editor Tony Williamson, to come up with an alternative idea. Newman indicated near the end of his life that he had, indeed, been significantly involved in the rewrites, suggesting that his critic Mary Whitehouse had been partial inspiration for the character. Many of the indoor scenes were filmed at Studios 3 and 5 at the BBC Television Centre in London.

===Filming===
Gerald Harper chose to wear false eyebrows when playing the title role, based on those of his make-up artist. He also wore a wig. Harper was shortsighted and wore glasses, which he removed as soon as filming was ready to start. When the series ended, the make-up woman sewed his fake eyebrows onto a sampler, with &quot;Here lie the Eyebrows of Adam Adamant, 1966–1967&quot; underneath, which was framed and given to Harper as a memento. He also kept his chararcter&#x27;s swordstick, and both remain on his wall at home to this day.

=== Cancellation ===
Television critic Paul Stump opines in the BBC Four documentary &quot;The Cult of Adam Adamant!&quot; that the programme ended because the contemporaneously airing &quot;The Avengers&quot; was a &quot;sexier, slicker, better-funded&quot; version of the same concept.

Gerald Harper went on to appear in Yorkshire Television&#x27;s &quot;Gazette&quot; and its sequel &quot;Hadleigh&quot;.

== Episodes ==
The untransmitted pilot episode, &quot;Adam Adamant Lives&quot;, no longer exists in the BBC Archives. All of series one, with the exception of &quot;Ticket to Terror&quot;, is held by the BBC. Series two has not fared so well, with only &quot;Black Echo&quot; and &quot;A Sinister Sort of Service&quot; remaining in existence.

===Pilot episode - Adam Adamant===

===Series 1 (1966)===
===Series 2: 1966–67===

===Lost episodes===

There were originally 29 black-and-white episodes composing two series, plus one unbroadcast pilot titled &quot;Adam Adamant Lives&quot; (without exclamation mark, as here). The 1902 sequence is now all that is known to survive of this unseen debut episode of the series, and only exists because it was later reused in &quot;A Vintage Year for Scoundrels&quot;. No script of &quot;Adam Adamant Lives&quot; is known to exist, and the only documentation that remains is the description given in the Drama Early Warning Synopsis issued on Thursday 10 March 1966; this is included in the booklet &quot;Adam Adamant Lives!: Viewing Notes&quot; accompanying the DVD boxed set &quot;Adam Adamant Lives!: The Complete Collection&quot; released by 2entertain Ltd in July 2006.

The first series, with the exception of &quot;Ticket to Terror&quot;, was made as a mixture of single camera 16 mm film for the location sequences, and multi-camera studio recording using 625-line electronic cameras. However, instead of being edited on video tape, as was the usual BBC procedure, the series was edited entirely on film, with the output of the studio cameras being telerecorded, for ease of editing. (At that time, videotape editing was difficult.)

&quot;Ticket to Terror&quot; from the first series, and all of the second series, were made with the usual BBC mix of tape and film, but were edited on tape. Wiping by the BBC in the 1970s has resulted in no master videotapes having survived. Film recordings haven&#x27;t all survived either as, in one case, one episode on 35 mm film is known to have been destroyed.

The result of all this is that only 16 episodes remained in the archives when the BBC realised the value of such material, including the first and last episodes in broadcast order. These were mainly in the form of 35 mm film telerecordings, with a handful of episodes as 16mm film recordings or reduction prints. In the case of some episodes, the 35 mm location footage also exists, and has been used to remaster those surviving episodes. The last episode of Series One, &quot;D For Destruction&quot;, thought to be among those lost forever, was recovered in 2003, from a mislabelled film can in the BBC Archives. It has been shown in public at the Missing Believed Wiped event, and is included in the &quot;Complete Collection&quot; DVD set.

Another lost episode, &quot;The Basardi Affair&quot;, was recovered as a complete off-air audio recording in 2017, and remains to date the only missing &quot;Adam Adamant Lives!&quot; episode known to exist in this format.

A public appeal campaign, the BBC Archive Treasure Hunt, continues to search for missing episodes.

==Influences and legacy==

===&quot;The Avengers&quot;===
With its pairing of an upper-class adventurer with a &quot;trendy&quot; woman of the 1960s, parallels have been drawn with competitor ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Avengers&quot;. There was also a similarity with Granada&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Rose&quot; (1967) in which William Mervyn as a retired police inspector was assisted by a youngish confidential secretary (Gillian Lewis) and a manservant (Donald Webster). However, because &quot;Adam Adamant&quot; was a last-minute replacement for another concept, the degree to which the BBC intended such similarities with &quot;The Avengers&quot; is unclear. Lambert directly addressed the issue: &quot;In &quot;Adam Adamant Lives&quot;, we were trying to create something original. Even though it may have been aimed at a similar audience to &quot;The Avengers&quot; – any production decisions we made were not influenced by trying to imitate&quot;.
However, a reviewer of the 2006 BBC Four retrospective &quot;The Cult of ... Adam Adamant Lives!&quot; detected something more to the issue when Lambert and other principals were interviewed on camera: 

Anthony Clark at the British Film Institute|(BFI) noted that while the show &quot;owes a stylistic debt to &quot;The Avengers&quot;&quot;, it was &quot;the BBC&#x27;s reply to the success of ITV&#x27;s spy and action series like &quot;The Saint&quot; (1962–69) and &quot;Danger Man&quot; (1960–69)&quot;. He goes on to call the character of Adamant &quot;more age-of-empire adventurer than spoof spy&quot;. A Television Heaven review said that while the programme has been &quot;long cited as the BBC&#x27;s answer to &quot;The Avengers&quot;&quot;, it in fact &quot;owes more to the slick style, tone and format of Lew Grade&#x27;s phenomenally successful ITC stable of action series rather than the sleek and sophisticated antics of Steed and Mrs Peel&quot;.

===&quot;Doctor Who&quot;===
Harper&#x27;s portrayal of Adamant has been cited as formative to Jon Pertwee&#x27;s interpretation of the Doctor. The BBC&#x27;s episode guide to &quot;Doctor Who&quot; claims parallels between the Third Doctor&#x27;s inaugural scenes in a hospital with those of Adamant in his pilot, &quot;A Vintage Year for Scoundrels&quot;.

===&quot;Austin Powers&quot;===
&quot;Adamant&quot; is frequently viewed as partial inspiration for &quot;Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery&quot;. In particular, allusions are seen between the way in which Austin Powers, like Adamant, is revived from cryogenic sleep and befriended by an attractive woman who had known of his exploits before being frozen. The formula is exactly reversed in &quot;Powers&quot;, however, in that his partner, Vanessa Kensington, is not impressed with his previous record of service, whereas Georgina Jones is a positive fan of Adamant.

==Big Finish audio series==
Audio drama production company Big Finish Productions announced that they would be producing a new series of audio plays, written by and co-starring actor-novelist Guy Adams. Nicholas Briggs is the director. Blake Ritson took over the title role. The first volume, &quot;A Vintage Year for Scoundrels&quot;, was released in January 2020. A second volume, &quot;Face Off&quot; was released in August 2020.

<doc id="62332" wikidata="Q252880" url="?curid=62332" title="Deep-sea fish">
<text>Deep-sea fish are fish that live in the darkness below the sunlit surface waters, that is below the epipelagic or photic zone of the sea. The lanternfish is, by far, the most common deep-sea fish. Other deep-sea fishes include the flashlight fish, cookiecutter shark, bristlemouths, anglerfish, viperfish, and some species of eelpout.

Only about 2% of known marine species inhabit the pelagic environment. This means that they live in the water column as opposed to the benthic organisms that live in or on the sea floor. Deep-sea organisms generally inhabit bathypelagic (1-4 km, 0.6-2.5 mi deep) and abyssopelagic (4-6 km, 2.5-3.7 mi deep) zones. However, characteristics of deep-sea organisms, such as bioluminescence can be seen in the mesopelagic (200-1,000 m, 650-3,300 ft deep) zone as well. The mesopelagic zone is the disphotic zone, meaning light there is minimal but still measurable. The oxygen minimum layer exists somewhere between a depth of 700 and 1,000 metres (2,300-3,300 ft) deep depending on the place in the ocean. This area is also where nutrients are most abundant. The bathypelagic and abyssopelagic zones are aphotic, meaning that no light penetrates this area of the ocean. These zones make up about 75% of the inhabitable ocean space.

The epipelagic zone (0-200 metres or 0-650 ft deep) is the area where light penetrates the water and photosynthesis occurs. This is also known as the photic zone. Because this typically extends only a few hundred meters below the water, the deep sea, about 90% of the ocean volume, is in darkness. The deep sea is also an extremely hostile environment, with temperatures that rarely exceed and fall as low as (with the exception of hydrothermal vent ecosystems that can exceed 350 °C, or 662 °F), low oxygen levels, and pressures between 20 and 1000 atm (2-100 MPa, 300-14,500 psi).

== Evolution ==
It has been speculated that deep-sea ecosystems may have been inhospitable to vertebrate life prior to an increased influx of nutrients into the ocean during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous following the rise of angiosperms on land, which led to an increase in abyssal invertebrate life, allowing fish to in turn colonize these ecosystems. However, some modern deep-sea fish, such as holocephalians, are descendants of much older lineages, indicating that much earlier colonizations of the deep-sea by vertebrates may have occurred, although no fossil evidence of this is known.

The earliest known records of deep-sea fish are trace fossils of feeding and swimming behavior attributed to unidentified neoteleosts (referable to the ichnogenera &quot;Piscichnus&quot; and &quot;Undichna&quot;), from the Early Cretaceous (130 million-year-old) Palombini Shale of Italy, which is thought to have been deposited in the abyssal plain of the former Piemont-Liguria Ocean. Prior to the discovery of these fossils, there was no evidence for deep-sea bony fish older than 50 million years in the Paleogene. The Cretaceous origin for most modern deep-sea fish has been further affirmed with phylogenetic studies such as those of aulopiform fish, which indicate that many deep-sea lineages of these groups originated around this time.

Although the records from the Palombini Shale represent the earliest records of deep-sea bony fish, formations that preserve deepwater shark fossils are also known from later in the Cretaceous. These include the Northumberland Formation of Canada and similarly aged deposits in Angola, both of which preserve fossils of taxa such as hexanchids, chlamydoselachids, and catsharks, which are known from deepwater habitats today but rare in other formations of the time. Paleogene formations with fossil deep-sea shark teeth are known from New Zealand for the middle Paleocene, and formations in Denmark, France, Austria, and Morocco during the Eocene. The Paratethys Sea still supported deepwater sharks and rays into the Miocene, which are preserved in formations in Hungary.

During the Paleogene, some prominent formations that preserve well-articulated specimens of deep-sea bony fish are known. These include the Monte Solane lagerstatte of early Eocene Italy, which preserves a bathypelagic habitat likely deposited 300–600 meters (1,000-2,000 ft) under the sea, as well as the late Eocene Pabdeh Formation of Iran. The deep-sea environments preserved by both formations are apparent through their abundance of fossil stomiiform fish. Notable Neogene formations that preserve fossils of deep-sea bony fish are known from the Miocene of Italy, Japan, and California.

==Environment==
In the deep ocean, the waters extend far below the epipelagic zone, and support very different types of pelagic fishes adapted to living in these deeper zones. In deep water, marine snow is a continuous shower of mostly organic detritus falling from the upper layers of the water column. Its origin lies in activities within the productive photic zone. Marine snow includes dead or dying plankton, protists (diatoms), fecal matter, sand, soot and other inorganic dust. The &quot;snowflakes&quot; grow over time and may reach several centimetres in diameter, travelling for weeks before reaching the ocean floor. However, most organic components of marine snow are consumed by microbes, zooplankton and other filter-feeding animals within the first 1,000 metres (3,300 ft) of their journey, that is, within the epipelagic zone. In this way marine snow may be considered the foundation of deep-sea mesopelagic and benthic ecosystems: As sunlight cannot reach them, deep-sea organisms rely heavily on marine snow as an energy source. Since there is no light in the deep sea (aphotic), there is a lack of primary producers. Therefore, most organisms in the bathypelagic rely on the marine snow from regions higher in the vertical column.

Some deep-sea pelagic groups, such as the lanternfish, ridgehead, marine hatchetfish, and lightfish families, are sometimes termed &quot;pseudoceanic&quot; because, rather than having an even distribution in open water, they occur in significantly higher abundances around structural oases, notably seamounts and over continental slopes. The phenomenon is explained by the likewise abundance of prey species which are also attracted to the structures.

Hydrostatic pressure increases by 1 atm (0.1 MPa) for every 10 m (32.8 ft) in depth. Deep-sea organisms have the same pressure within their bodies as is exerted on them from the outside, so they are not crushed by the extreme pressure. Their high internal pressure, however, results in the reduced fluidity of their membranes because molecules are squeezed together. Fluidity in cell membranes increases efficiency of biological functions, most importantly the production of proteins, so organisms have adapted to this circumstance by increasing the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids in the lipids of the cell membranes. In addition to differences in internal pressure, these organisms have developed a different balance between their metabolic reactions from those organisms that live in the epipelagic zone. David Wharton, author of &quot;Life at the Limits: Organisms in Extreme Environments&quot;, notes &quot;Biochemical reactions are accompanied by changes in volume. If a reaction results in an increase in volume, it will be inhibited by pressure, whereas, if it is associated with a decrease in volume, it will be enhanced&quot;. This means that their metabolic processes must ultimately decrease the volume of the organism to some degree.

Most fish that have evolved in this harsh environment are not capable of surviving in laboratory conditions, and attempts to keep them in captivity have led to their deaths. Deep-sea organisms contain gas-filled spaces (vacuoles). Gas is compressed under high pressure and expands under low pressure. Because of this, these organisms have been known to blow up if they come to the surface.

==Characteristics==


The fish of the deep-sea have evolved various adaptations to survive in this region. Since many of these fish live in regions where there is no natural illumination, they cannot rely solely on their eyesight for locating prey and mates and avoiding predators; deep-sea fish have evolved appropriately to the extreme sub-photic region in which they live. Many of these organisms are blind and rely on their other senses, such as sensitivities to changes in local pressure and smell, to catch their food and avoid being caught. Those that aren&#x27;t blind have large and sensitive eyes that can use bioluminescent light. These eyes can be as much as 100 times more sensitive to light than human eyes. Rhodopsin (Rh1) is a protein found in the eye’s rod cells that helps animals see in dim light. While most vertebrates usually have one Rh1 opsin gene, some deep-sea fish have several Rh1 genes, and one species, the silver spinyfin (&quot;Diretmus argenteus&quot;), has 38. This proliferation of Rh1 genes may help deep-sea fish to see in the depths of the ocean. Also, to avoid predation, many species are dark to blend in with their environment.

Many deep-sea fish are bioluminescent, with extremely large eyes adapted to the dark. Bioluminescent organisms are capable of producing light biologically through the agitation of molecules of luciferin, which then produce light. This process must be done in the presence of oxygen. These organisms are common in the mesopelagic region and below ( and below). More than 50% of deep-sea fish, as well as some species of shrimp and squid, are capable of bioluminescence. About 80% of these organisms have photophores – light producing glandular cells that contain luminous bacteria bordered by dark colourings. Some of these photophores contain lenses, much like those in the eyes of humans, which can intensify or lessen the emanation of light. The ability to produce light only requires 1% of the organism&#x27;s energy and has many purposes: It is used to search for food and attract prey, like the anglerfish; claim territory through patrol; communicate and find a mate, and distract or temporarily blind predators to escape. Also, in the mesopelagic where some light still penetrates, some organisms camouflage themselves from predators below them by illuminating their bellies to match the colour and intensity of light from above so that no shadow is cast. This tactic is known as counter-illumination.

The lifecycle of deep-sea fish can be exclusively deep-water, although some species are born in shallower water and sink upon maturation. Regardless of the depth where eggs and larvae reside, they are typically pelagic. This planktonic — drifting — lifestyle requires neutral buoyancy. In order to maintain this, the eggs and larvae often contain oil droplets in their plasma. When these organisms are in their fully matured state they need other adaptations to maintain their positions in the water column. In general, water&#x27;s density causes upthrust — the aspect of buoyancy that makes organisms float. To counteract this, the density of an organism must be greater than that of the surrounding water. Most animal tissues are denser than water, so they must find an equilibrium to make them float. Many organisms develop swim bladders (gas cavities) to stay afloat, but because of the high pressure of their environment, deep-sea fishes usually do not have this organ. Instead they exhibit structures similar to hydrofoils in order to provide hydrodynamic lift. It has also been found that the deeper a fish lives, the more jelly-like its flesh and the more minimal its bone structure. They reduce their tissue density through high fat content, reduction of skeletal weight — accomplished through reductions of size, thickness and mineral content — and water accumulation makes them slower and less agile than surface fish. The body shapes of deep-sea fish are generally better adapted for periodic bursts of swimming rather than constant swimming. 

Due to the poor level of photosynthetic light reaching deep-sea environments, most fish need to rely on organic matter sinking from higher levels, or, in rare cases, hydrothermal vents for nutrients. This makes the deep-sea much poorer in productivity than shallower regions. Also, animals in the pelagic environment are sparse and food doesn&#x27;t come along frequently. Because of this, organisms need adaptations that allow them to survive. Some have long feelers to help them locate prey or attract mates in the pitch black of the deep ocean. The deep-sea angler fish in particular has a long fishing-rod-like adaptation protruding from its face, on the end of which is a bioluminescent piece of skin that wriggles like a worm to lure its prey. Some must consume other fish that are the same size or larger than them and they need adaptations to help digest them efficiently. Great sharp teeth, hinged jaws, disproportionately large mouths, and expandable bodies are a few of the characteristics that deep-sea fishes have for this purpose. The gulper eel is one example of an organism that displays these characteristics.

Fish in the different pelagic and deep-water benthic zones are physically structured, and behave in ways, that differ markedly from each other. Groups of coexisting species within each zone all seem to operate in similar ways, such as the small mesopelagic vertically migrating plankton-feeders, the bathypelagic anglerfishes, and the deep-water benthic rattails.

Ray finned species, with spiny fins, are rare among deep-sea fishes, which suggests that deep-sea fish are ancient and so well adapted to their environment that invasions by more modern fishes have been unsuccessful. The few ray fins that do exist are mainly in the Beryciformes and Lampriformes, which are also ancient forms. Most deep-sea pelagic fishes belong to their own orders, suggesting a long evolution in deep-sea environments. In contrast, deep-water benthic species, are in orders that include many related shallow-water fishes.

==Mesopelagic fish==
Below the epipelagic zone, conditions change rapidly. Between 200 m and about 1000 m, light continues to fade until there is almost none. Temperatures fall through a thermocline to temperatures between 3.9 °C (39 °F) and 7.8 °C (46 °F). This is the twilight or mesopelagic zone. Pressure continues to increase, at the rate of one atm (0.1 MPa) every 10 m (32.8 ft), while nutrient concentrations fall, along with dissolved oxygen and the rate at which the water circulates.

Sonar operators, using the newly developed sonar technology during , were puzzled by what appeared to be a false sea floor deep by day, and less deep at night. This turned out to be due to millions of marine organisms, most particularly small mesopelagic fish, with swim bladders that reflected the sonar. These organisms migrate up into shallower water at dusk to feed on plankton. The layer is deeper when the moon is out, and can become shallower when clouds pass over the moon. This phenomenon has come to be known as the deep scattering layer.

Most mesopelagic fish make daily vertical migrations, moving at night into the epipelagic zone, often following similar migrations of zooplankton, and returning to the depths for safety during the day. These vertical migrations often occur over large vertical distances, and are undertaken with the assistance of a swim bladder. The swim bladder is inflated when the fish wants to move up, and, given the high pressures in the messoplegic zone, this requires significant energy. As the fish ascends, the pressure in the swim bladder must adjust to prevent it from bursting. When the fish wants to return to the depths, the swim bladder is deflated. Some mesopelagic fishes make daily migrations through the thermocline, where the temperature changes between 50 °F (10 °C) and 69 °F (20 °C), thus displaying considerable tolerances for temperature change.

These fish have muscular bodies, ossified bones, scales, well developed gills and central nervous systems, and large hearts and kidneys. Mesopelagic plankton feeders have small mouths with fine gill rakers, while the piscivores have larger mouths and coarser gill rakers.

Mesopelagic fish are adapted for an active life under low light conditions. Most of them are visual predators with large eyes. Some of the deeper water fish have tubular eyes with big lenses and only rod cells that look upwards. These give binocular vision and great sensitivity to small light signals. This adaptation gives improved terminal vision at the expense of lateral vision, and allows the predator to pick out squid, cuttlefish, and smaller fish that are silhouetted against the gloom above them.

Mesopelagic fish usually lack defensive spines, and use colour to camouflage themselves from other fish. Ambush predators are dark, black or red. Since the longer, red, wavelengths of light do not reach the deep sea, red effectively functions the same as black. Migratory forms use countershaded silvery colours. On their bellies, they often display photophores producing low grade light. For a predator from below, looking upwards, this bioluminescence camouflages the silhouette of the fish. However, some of these predators have yellow lenses that filter the (red deficient) ambient light, leaving the bioluminescence visible.

The brownsnout spookfish, a species of barreleye, is the only vertebrate known to employ a mirror, as opposed to a lens, to focus an image in its eyes.

Sampling by deep trawling indicates that lanternfish account for as much as 65% of all deep-sea fish biomass. Indeed, lanternfish are among the most widely distributed, populous, and diverse of all vertebrates, playing an important ecological role as prey for larger organisms. The estimated global biomass of lanternfish is 550–660 million tonnes, several times the entire world fisheries catch. Lanternfish also account for much of the biomass responsible for the deep scattering layer of the world&#x27;s oceans.

Bigeye tuna are an epipelagic/mesopelagic species that eats other fish. Satellite tagging has shown that bigeye tuna often spend prolonged periods cruising deep below the surface during the daytime, sometimes making dives as deep as . These movements are thought to be in response to the vertical migrations of prey organisms in the deep scattering layer.

==Bathypelagic fish==
Below the mesopelagic zone it is pitch dark. This is the midnight (or bathypelagic zone), extending from to the bottom deep-water benthic zone. If the water is exceptionally deep, the pelagic zone below is sometimes called the lower midnight (or abyssopelagic zone). Temperatures in this zone range from and it is completely aphotic.

Conditions are somewhat uniform throughout these zones; the darkness is complete, the pressure is crushing, and temperatures, nutrients and dissolved oxygen levels are all low.

Bathypelagic fish have special adaptations to cope with these conditions – they have slow metabolisms and unspecialized diets, being willing to eat anything that comes along. They prefer to sit and wait for food rather than waste energy searching for it. The behaviour of bathypelagic fish can be contrasted with the behaviour of mesopelagic fish. Mesopelagic fish are often highly mobile, whereas bathypelagic fish are almost all lie-in-wait predators, normally expending little energy in movement.

The dominant bathypelagic fishes are small bristlemouth and anglerfish; fangtooth, viperfish, daggertooth and barracudina are also common. These fishes are small, many about long, and not many longer than . They spend most of their time waiting patiently in the water column for prey to appear or to be lured by their phosphors. What little energy is available in the bathypelagic zone filters from above in the form of detritus, faecal material, and the occasional invertebrate or mesopelagic fish. About 20 percent of the food that has its origins in the epipelagic zone falls down to the mesopelagic zone, but only about 5 percent filters down to the bathypelagic zone.

Bathypelagic fish are sedentary, adapted to outputting minimum energy in a habitat with very little food or available energy, not even sunlight, only bioluminescence. Their bodies are with weak, watery muscles and skeletal structures. Since so much of the fish is water, they are not compressed by the great pressures at these depths. They often have extensible, hinged jaws with recurved teeth. They are slimy, without scales. The central nervous system is confined to the lateral line and olfactory systems, the eyes are small and may not function, and gills, kidneys and hearts, and swim bladders are small or missing. These are the same features found in fish larvae, which suggests that during their evolution, bathypelagic fish have acquired these features through neoteny. As with larvae, these features allow the fish to remain suspended in the water with little expenditure of energy.

Despite their ferocious appearance, these forms are mostly miniature fish with weak muscles, and are too small to represent any threat to humans. An exception to the generally small size of bathypelagic fish is the Yokozuna slickhead (&quot;Narcetes shonanmaruae&quot;), described in 2021, which is the largest known entirely bathypelagic bony fish at over in length.

The swim bladders of deep-sea fish are either absent or scarcely operational, and bathypelagic fish do not normally undertake vertical migrations. Filling bladders at such great pressures incurs huge energy costs. Some deep-sea fishes have swim bladders which function while they are young and inhabit the upper epipelagic zone, but they wither or fill with fat when the fish move down to their adult habitat.

A couple of known exceptions are the cusk-eel (&quot;Holcomycteronus profundissimus&quot;), retrieved from 7160 meters deep, and the rough abyssal grenadier (&quot;Coryphaenoides yaquinae&quot;), found at 7259 meters depth. These species still have functional swim bladders, which allows them to maintain high bone density and strong jaws.

The most important sensory systems are usually the inner ear, which responds to sound, and the lateral line, which responds to changes in water pressure. The olfactory system can also be important for males who find females by smell.
Bathypelagic fish are black, or sometimes red, with few photophores. When photophores are used, it is usually to entice prey or attract a mate. Because food is so scarce, bathypelagic predators are not selective in their feeding habits, but grab whatever comes close enough. They accomplish this by having a large mouth with sharp teeth for grabbing large prey and overlapping gill rakers which prevent small prey that have been swallowed from escaping.

It is not easy finding a mate in this zone. Some species depend on bioluminescence, where bioluminescent patterns are unique to specific species. Others are hermaphrodites, which doubles their chances of producing both eggs and sperm when an encounter occurs. The female anglerfish releases pheromones to attract tiny males. When a male finds her, he bites on to her and never lets go. When a male of the anglerfish species &quot;Haplophryne mollis&quot; bites into the skin of a female, he releases an enzyme that digests the skin of his mouth and her body, fusing the pair to the point where the two circulatory systems join up. The male then atrophies into nothing more than a pair of gonads. This extreme sexual dimorphism ensures that, when the female is ready to spawn, she has a mate immediately available.

Many forms other than fish live in the bathypelagic zone, such as squid, large whales, octopuses, sponges, brachiopods, sea stars, and echinoids, but this zone is difficult for fish to live in.

==Adaptation to high pressure==
As a fish moves deeper into the sea, the weight of the water overhead exerts increasing hydrostatic pressure on the fish. This increased pressure amounts to about one atm (0.1 MPa) for every 10 m (32.8 ft)in depth. For a fish at the bottom of the bathypelagic zone, this pressure amounts to about 400 atm (40 MPa, 6000 psi).

Deep-sea organisms possess adaptations at cellular and physiological levels that allow them to survive in environments of great pressure. Not having these adaptations limits the depths at which shallow-water species can operate. High levels of external pressure affects how metabolic processes and biochemical reactions proceed. The equilibrium of many chemical reactions is disturbed by pressure, and pressure can inhibit processes which result in an increase in volume. Water, a key component in many biological processes, is very susceptible to volume changes, mainly because constituents of cellular fluid have an effect on water structure. Thus, enzymatic reactions that induce changes in water organization effectively change the system&#x27;s volume. Proteins responsible for catalyzing reactions are typically held together by weak bonds and the reactions usually involve volume increases.

Species that can tolerate these depths have evolved changes in their protein structure and reaction criteria to withstand pressure, in order to perform reactions in these conditions. In high pressure environments, bilayer cellular membranes experience a loss of fluidity. Deep-sea cellular membranes favor phospholipid bilayers with a higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids, which induce a higher fluidity than their sea-level counterparts.

Ten orders, thirteen families and about 200 known species of deep-sea fish have evolved a gelatinous layer below the skin or around the spine, which is used for buoyancy, low-cost growth and to increase swimming efficiency by reducing drag.

Deep-sea species exhibit lower changes of entropy and enthalpy compared to surface level organisms, since a high pressure and low temperature environment favors negative enthalpy changes and reduced dependence on entropy-driven reactions. From a structural standpoint, globular proteins of deep-sea fish due to the tertiary structure of G-actin are relatively rigid compared to those of surface level fish. The fact that proteins in deep-sea fish are structurally different from surface fish is apparent from the observation that actin from the muscle fibers of deep-sea fish are extremely heat-resistant; an observation similar to what is found in lizards. These proteins are structurally strengthened by modification of the bonds in the tertiary structure of the protein which also happens to induce high levels of thermal stability. Proteins are structurally strengthened to resist pressure by modification of bonds in the tertiary structure. Therefore, high levels of hydrostatic pressure, similar to high body temperatures of thermophilic desert reptiles, favor rigid protein structures.

Na+/K+ -ATPase is a lipoprotein enzyme that plays a prominent role in osmoregulation and is heavily influenced by hydrostatic pressure. The inhibition of Na+/K+ -ATPase is due to increased compression due to pressure. The rate-limiting step of the Na+/K+ -ATPase reaction induces an expansion in the bilayer surrounding the protein, and therefore an increase in volume. An increase in volume makes Na+/K+ -ATPase reactivity susceptible to higher pressures. Even though the Na+/K+ -ATPase activity per gram of gill tissue is lower for deep-sea fishes, the Na+/K+ -ATPases of deep-sea fishes exhibit a much higher tolerance of hydrostatic pressure compared to their shallow-water counterparts. This is exemplified between the species &quot;C. acrolepis&quot; (around 2000 m deep) and its hadalpelagic counterpart &quot;C. armatus&quot; (around deep), where the Na+/K+ -ATPases of &quot;C. armatus&quot; are much less sensitive to pressure. This resistance to pressure can be explained by adaptations in the protein and lipid moieties of Na+/K+ -ATPase. 

==Lanternfish==
Sampling via deep trawling indicates that lanternfish account for as much as 65% of all deep-sea fish biomass. Indeed, lanternfish are among the most widely distributed, populous, and diverse of all vertebrates, playing an important ecological role as prey for larger organisms. With an estimated global biomass of 550–660 million metric tons, several times the entire world fisheries catch, lanternfish also account for much of the biomass responsible for the deep scattering layer of the world&#x27;s oceans. In the Southern Ocean, Myctophids provide an alternative food resource to krill for predators such as squid and the king penguin. Although these fish are plentiful and prolific, currently only a few commercial lanternfish fisheries exist: these include limited operations off South Africa, in the sub-Antarctic, and in the Gulf of Oman.

==Endangered species==
A 2006 study by Canadian scientists has found five species of deep-sea fish – blue hake, spiny eel – to be on the verge of extinction due to the shift of commercial fishing from continental shelves to the slopes of the continental shelves, down to depths of . The slow reproduction of these fish – they reach sexual maturity at about the same age as human beings – is one of the main reasons that they cannot recover from the excessive fishing.

<doc id="62342" wikidata="Q1637948" url="?curid=62342" title="RSX-11">
<text>RSX-11 is a discontinued family of multi-user real-time operating systems for PDP-11 computers created by Digital Equipment Corporation. In widespread use through the late 1970s and early 1980s, RSX-11 was influential in the development of later operating systems such as VMS and Windows NT.

As the original &quot;Real-Time System Executive&quot; name suggests, RSX was designed (and commonly used) for real time use, with process control a major use. It was also popular for program development and general computing.

==History==
===Name and origins===
RSX-11 began as a port to the PDP-11 architecture of the earlier RSX-15 operating system for the PDP-15 minicomputer, first released in 1971.
The main architect for RSX-15 (later renamed XVM/RSX) was Dennis “Dan” Brevik.

Commenting on the &quot;RSX&quot; acronym, Brevik says:
===RSX-11D and IAS=== 
The porting effort first produced small paper tape based real-time executives (RSX-11A, RSX-11C) which later gained limited support for disks (RSX-11B). RSX-11B then evolved into the fully fledged RSX-11D disk-based operating system, which first appeared on the PDP-11/40 and PDP-11/45 in early 1973. The project leader for RSX-11D up to version 4 was Henry Krejci.

While RSX-11D was being completed, Digital set out to adapt it for a small memory footprint, giving birth to RSX-11M, first released in 1973. From 1971 to 1976, the RSX-11M project was spearheaded by noted operating system designer Dave Cutler, then at his first project. Principles first tried in RSX-11M appear also in later designs led by Cutler, DEC&#x27;s VMS and MICA and Microsoft&#x27;s Windows NT.

Under the direction of Ron McLean a derivative of RSX-11M, called RSX-20F, was developed to run on the PDP-11/40 front-end processor for the KL10 PDP-10 CPU.

Meanwhile, RSX-11D saw further developments: under the direction of Garth Wolfendale (project leader 1972–1976) the system was redesigned and saw its first commercial release. Support for the 22-bit PDP-11/70 system was added. Wolfendale, originally from the UK, also set up the team that designed and prototyped the Interactive Application System (IAS) operating system in the UK; IAS was a variant of RSX-11D more suitable for time sharing. Later development and release of IAS was led by Andy Wilson, in Digital&#x27;s UK facilities.

===Release dates===
Below are estimated release dates for RSX-11 and IAS. Data is taken from the printing date of the associated documentation. General availability date is expected to come closely after. When manuals have different printing dates, the latest date is used. RSX-11S is a proper subset of RSX-11M, so release dates are always assumed to be the same as the corresponding version of RSX-11M. On the other side, RSX-11M Plus is an enhanced version of RSX-11M, so it is expected to be later than the corresponding version of RSX-11M.

===Legal ownership, development model and availability===
RSX-11 is proprietary software. Copyright is asserted in binary files, source code and documentation alike. It was entirely developed internally by Digital. Therefore, no part of it is open source. However a copy of the kernel source is present in every RSX distribution, because it was used during the system generation process. The notable exception to this rule is Micro-RSX, which came with a pre-generated autoconfiguring binary kernel. Full sources was available as a separate product to those who already had a binary license, for reference purposes.

Ownership of RSX-11S, RSX-11M, RSX-11M Plus and Micro/RSX was transferred from Digital to Mentec Inc. in March 1994 as part of a broader agreement.
Mentec Inc. was the US subsidiary of Mentec Limited, an Irish firm specializing in PDP-11 hardware and software support. In 2006 Mentec Inc. was declared bankrupt while Mentec Ltd. was acquired by Irish firm Calyx in December 2006. The PDP-11 software, which was owned by Mentec Inc. was then bought by XX2247 LLC, which is the owner of the software today. It is unclear if new commercial licenses are possible to buy at this time. Hobbyists can run RSX-11M (version 4.3 or earlier) and RSX-11M Plus (version 3.0 or earlier) on the SIMH emulator thanks to a free license granted in May 1998 by Mentec Inc.

Legal ownership of RSX-11A, RSX-11B, RSX-11C, RSX-11D, and IAS never changed hands; therefore it passed to Compaq when it acquired Digital in 1998 and then to Hewlett-Packard in 2002. In late 2015 Hewlett-Packard split into two separate companies (HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise), so the current owner cannot be firmly established. No new commercial licenses have been issued since at least October 1979 (RSX-11A, RSX-11B, RSX-11C) or 1990 (IAS), and none of these operating systems have ever been licensed for hobbyist use.

==Versions==
===Main versions=== 
*RSX-11A, C – small paper tape real time executives
*RSX-11B – small real time executive based on RSX-11C with support for disk I/O. To start up the system, first DOS-11 was booted, and then RSX-11B was started. RSX-11B programs used DOS-11 macros to perform disk I/O.
*RSX-11D – a multiuser disk-based system, later evolved into IAS
*IAS – a timesharing-oriented variant of RSX-11D released at about the same time as the PDP-11/70. The first version of RSX to include DCL (Digital Command Language), which in IAS is known by its original name, PDS (Program Development System).
*RSX-11M – a multiuser version that was popular on all PDP-11s
*RSX-11S – a memory-resident version of RSX-11M used in embedded real-time applications. RSX-11S applications were developed under RSX-11M.
*RSX-11M-Plus – a much extended version of RSX-11M, originally designed to support the multi-processor PDP-11/74, a computer that was never released, but RSX-11M-Plus was then used widely as a standard operating system on the PDP-11/70.
:RSX-11M-Plus also ran on PDP-11/44, PDP-11/84, PDP-11/94 (Unibus machines), as well as PDP-11/73, PDP-11/83, and PDP-11/93 (Qbus machines). One of the advantages of RSX-11M-Plus over RSX-11M was that larger programs could be created. This was achieved by having the task builder (the linker) build the program to use the separate instruction and data space feature of some PDP-11 models to put executable code and data into separate address spaces. This also allowed programs to run faster, as it reduced the need for &quot;overlays&quot;, in which you could overlay object modules at task build time, for very large programs. Overlays were specified in a task build command file.

===Hardware-specific variants===
*RSX-20F – Customized version of RSX-11M, to be run on PDP-11/40 front end processor operating system for the DEC KL10 processor
*Micro/RSX – a pre-generated full version of RSX-11M-Plus with hardware autoconfiguration, implemented specifically for the Micro/PDP-11s, a low-cost multi-user system in a box, featuring ease of installation, no system generation, and a special documentation set. Later superseded by RSX-11M Plus.
*P/OS – A version of RSX-11M-Plus that was targeted to the DEC Professional line of PDP-11-based personal computers

===Clones in the USSR and other Eastern Bloc countries===
In 1968, the Soviet Government decided that manufacturing copies of IBM mainframes
and DEC minicomputers, in cooperation with other COMECON countries, was more practical than pursuing original designs. Cloning of DEC designs began in 1974, under the name of SM EVM ( or ). As happened with ES EVM mainframes based on the System/360 architecture, the Russians and their allies sometimes significantly modified Western designs, and therefore many SM EVM machines were binary-incompatible with DEC offerings at the time.

*DOS/RV, , ОСРВM – Three names for an unauthorised clone of RSX-11M produced in the Eastern bloc. The name ОСРВ is an acronym for . This system appears to be an exact duplicate of RSX-11M except a different header in binary files. Differences between RSX and ОСРВ are due to hardware differences between SM and PDP computers and to bug-fixing done by Soviet engineers. However, the original RSX-11M was more used than its Russian clone ОСРВ, because the programmers modifying the original RSX-11M code were doing a better job, and patched RSX was more stable than ОСРВ. Other benefits included a faster update cycle for drivers and a larger choice of patches, made possible by a wider user community.

A clone of the RSX-11M operating system ran on the Romanian-made CORAL series family of computers (such as CORAL 2030, a clone of PDP-11).

==Operation==
RSX-11 was often used for general-purpose timeshare computing, even though this was the target market for the competing RSTS/E operating system. RSX-11 provided features to ensure better than a maximum necessary response time to peripheral device input (i.e. real-time processing), its original intended use. These features included the ability to lock a process (called a &quot;task&quot; under RSX) into memory as part of system boot up and to assign a process a higher priority so that it would execute before any processes with a lower priority.

In order to support large programs within the PDP-11&#x27;s relatively small virtual address space of 64 KB, a sophisticated semi-automatic overlay system was used; for any given program, this overlay scheme was produced by RSX&#x27;s &quot;taskbuilder&quot; program (called &quot;TKB&quot;). If the overlay scheme was especially complex, taskbuilding could take a rather long time (hours to days).

The standard RSX prompt is &quot;&gt;&quot; or &quot;MCR&gt;&quot;, (for the &quot;Monitor Console Routine&quot;. All commands can be shortened to their first three characters when entered and correspondingly all commands are unique in their first three characters. Only the login command of &quot;HELLO&quot; can be executed by a user not yet logged in. &quot;HELLO&quot; was chosen as the login command because only the first three characters, &quot;HEL&quot;, are relevant and this allows a non-logged in user to execute a &quot;HELP&quot; command.

When run on certain PDP-11 processors, each DEC operating system displays a characteristic light pattern on the processor console panel when the system is idle. These patterns are created by an idle task running at the lowest level. The RSX-11M light pattern is two sets of lights that sweep outwards to the left and right from the center of the console (inwards if the IND indirect command file processor program was currently running on older versions of RSX). By contrast, the IAS light pattern was a single bar of lights that swept leftwards. Correspondingly, a jumbled light pattern (reflecting memory fetches) is a visible indication that the computer is under load (and the idle task is not being executed). Other PDP-11 operating systems such as RSTS/E have their own distinctive patterns in the console lights.

<doc id="62345" wikidata="Q6766526" url="?curid=62345" title="Prune">
<text>A prune is a dried plum, most commonly from the European plum (&quot;Prunus domestica&quot;) tree. Not all plum species or varieties can be dried into prunes. A prune is the firm-fleshed fruit (plum) of &quot;Prunus domestica&quot; varieties that have a high soluble solids content, and do not ferment during drying. Use of the term &quot;prune&quot; for fresh plums is obsolete except when applied to varieties of plum grown for drying.

Most prunes are &quot;freestone&quot; cultivars (the pit is easy to remove), whereas most plums grown for fresh consumption are &quot;clingstone&quot; (the pit is more difficult to remove).

Prunes are 64% carbohydrates, including dietary fiber, 2% protein, a rich source of vitamin K, and a moderate source of B vitamins and dietary minerals. The sorbitol content of dietary fiber likely provides the laxative effect associated with consuming prunes.

==Production==
More than 1,000 plum cultivars are grown for drying. The main cultivar grown in the United States is the &#x27;Improved French&#x27; prune. Other varieties include &#x27;Sutter&#x27;, &#x27;Tulare Giant&#x27;, &#x27;Moyer&#x27;, &#x27;Imperial&#x27;, &#x27;Italian&#x27;, and greengages. Fresh prunes reach the market earlier than fresh plums and are usually smaller in size. The great majority of commercially grown prune varieties are self-fertile and do not need separate pollinator trees.

===Name change===
In 2001, plum growers in the United States were authorized by the Food and Drug Administration to call prunes &quot;dried plums&quot;. Due to a perception that prunes relieve constipation (perceived as derogatory), some distributors stopped using the word &quot;prune&quot; on packaging labels in favor of &quot;dried plums&quot;.

==Health effects==
Prunes contain dietary fiber (about 7% of weight) which may provide laxative effects. Their sorbitol content may also be responsible for this, a conclusion reached in a 2012 review by the European Food Safety Authority. The report also demonstrated that prunes effectively contribute to the maintenance of normal bowel function in the general population if consumed in quantities of at least per day.

===Nutrition===
Prunes are 31% water, 64% carbohydrates, including 7% dietary fiber, 2% protein, and less than 1% fat. Prunes are a moderate source of vitamin K (57% of the Daily Value, DV) and a moderate source of several B vitamins and dietary minerals (4–16% DV).

===Phytochemicals===
Prunes and prune juice contain phytochemicals, including phenolic compounds (mainly as neochlorogenic acids and chlorogenic acids) and sorbitol.

==Uses==

Prunes are used in preparing both sweet and savory dishes.

Contrary to the name, boiled plums or prunes are not used to make sugar plums, which instead may be nuts, seeds, or spices coated with hard sugar, also called comfits.
