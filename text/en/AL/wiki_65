<text>John Sidney Linnell ( ; born June 12, 1959) is an American musician and multi-instrumentalist, and is one half of the Brooklyn-based alternative rock band They Might Be Giants, with John Flansburgh, which was formed in 1982. In addition to singing and songwriting, he plays accordion, baritone and bass saxophone, clarinet, and keyboards for the group.

Linnell&#x27;s lyrics include strange subject matter and word play. Persistent themes include aging, delusional behavior, bad relationships, death, and the personification of inanimate objects. Conversely to some of these dark themes, the accompanying melodies are usually cascading and upbeat.

==Early life==
John Linnell was born in New York City, to father Zenos Linnell, (1925–2011), a psychiatrist, and mother Kathleen (née Glenn; 1926–2008). When Linnell was a child, Walt Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Songs of the Pogo&quot; album made a strong impression on his musical sensibilities. The album contained lyrics that relied heavily on puns and word play, which Linnell appreciated. In particular, he recalls &quot;Lines Upon a Tranquil Brow&quot;, which later became part of They Might Be Giants&#x27;s live repertoire. At an early age, Linnell and his family relocated to Lincoln, Massachusetts, where he attended Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School. Here, he worked on the school newspaper, the &quot;Promethean&quot;, and met John Flansburgh. The two occasionally collaborated on home-recording projects.

Linnell studied English for a semester at the University of Massachusetts Amherst before dropping out to pursue a career in music.

==Musical career==

===Early work===
In high school, Linnell played with a band called The Baggs. Prior to finding success in the alternative rock scene, Linnell was also involved with The Mundanes, a Rhode Island–based new wave band. Linnell played keyboards and saxophone for the group. Because of his unsatisfactory minor role in the band, and under the pressure of The Mundanes&#x27; unsuccessful search for a record deal, Linnell began leisurely recording music with John Flansburgh. His family did not support the transition from what they considered to be a more professional band to an experimental one.

===Since 1982: They Might Be Giants===

Linnell co-founded They Might Be Giants in 1982 with high school friend John Flansburgh. While the two split singing and songwriting duties roughly in half, Linnell&#x27;s songs enjoyed the most commercial success in their early years: singles like &quot;Don&#x27;t Let&#x27;s Start&quot; and &quot;Ana Ng&quot; introduced the band to college radio, and they made waves on the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in 1990 with &quot;Birdhouse in Your Soul&quot;. Linnell writes songs, sings, plays accordion, keyboards, and various woodwind instruments for the band.

Linnell described his role in the group during an interview for &quot;Splatter Effect&quot; in 1994:

In December 2005, the band began to produce a twice-monthly podcast. Early on, Linnell frequently contributed humorous spoken-word pieces to the program.

===1994–2021: Solo work===

Since 1994, Linnell has done some solo work: in that year he released the &quot;State Songs&quot; EP, which he expanded to a full-length album in 1999. The concept of the &quot;State Songs&quot; project is intentionally misleading: U.S. states feature prominently in the title and chorus of each song, but have very little to do with their actual narratives. &quot;Montana&quot;, for instance, is about the insane ramblings of somebody who is about to die; &quot;Idaho&quot; explores a famous rock story in which John Lennon, having consumed hallucinogenic drugs, believed he could drive his house; &quot;South Carolina&quot; is about getting rich as a result of a bicycle accident.

Other side-projects include the limited-release &quot;House of Mayors&quot; EP in 1996 through the Hello CD of the Month Club and in 1997 a flexi disc of the song &quot;Olive the Other Reindeer&quot; accompanying promotional copies of the children&#x27;s books, &quot;Olive, the Other Reindeer&quot;. Linnell has also appeared as a guest musician—often as an accordionist—on a number of musical efforts by other artists, including Suzanne Vega&#x27;s &quot;Days of Open Hand&quot; and David Byrne&#x27;s &quot;Grown Backwards&quot;.

Linnell provided the singing voice for the Other Father character in the 2009 film &quot;Coraline&quot;, for which They Might Be Giants wrote the &quot;Other Father Song&quot;, included on the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

In 2021, Linnell released a four-song EP containing original songs sung entirely in Latin, titled &quot;Roman Songs&quot;.

==Personal life==
Linnell married Karen Brown in 1997 and has one son, Henry (b. 1998), who appeared as a performer on They Might Be Giants&#x27; children&#x27;s albums &quot;Here Come the ABCs&quot; and &quot;Here Come the 123s&quot;, as well as his father&#x27;s solo album &quot;Roman Songs&quot;.

==&quot;People&quot; magazine poll==
In a &quot;People&quot; magazine online poll—&quot;The Most Beautiful People of 1998&quot;—Linnell finished ninth (with 4,189 votes, eight ahead of Sarah Michelle Gellar, and 1,038 behind Madonna). He responded to the poll results with an op-ed piece in &quot;The New York Times&quot;:

He went on to say, of online voting:

He was also known for his boyish good looks, which were said to have prompted the Irish poet W. B. Yeats to describe him as &quot;the handsomest young man in England&quot;. He died of septicaemia following a mosquito bite whilst aboard a French hospital ship moored off the island of Skyros in the Aegean Sea.

==Early life==

Brooke was born at 5 Hillmorton Road, Rugby, Warwickshire, and named after a great-grandfather on his mother&#x27;s side, Rupert Chawner (1750–1836), a distinguished doctor descended from the regicide Thomas Chaloner (the middle name has however sometimes been erroneously given as &quot;Chaucer&quot;). He was the third of four children of William Parker &quot;Willie&quot; Brooke, a schoolmaster, and Ruth Mary Brooke (&quot;née&quot; Cotterill), a school matron. Both parents were working at Fettes College in Edinburgh when they met. They married on 18 December 1879. William Parker Brooke had to resign after the couple wed, as there was no accommodation there for married masters. The couple then moved to Rugby in Warwickshire, where Rupert&#x27;s father became Master of School Field House at Rugby School a month later. His eldest brother was Richard England &quot;Dick&quot; Brooke (1881–1907); his sister Edith Marjorie Brooke was born in 1885 and died the following year, and his youngest brother was William Alfred Cotterill &quot;Podge&quot; Brooke (1891–1915).

Brooke attended preparatory (prep) school locally at Hillbrow, and then went on to Rugby School. At Rugby, he was romantically involved with fellow pupils Charles Lascelles, Denham Russell-Smith and Michael Sadleir. In 1905, he became friends with St. John Lucas, who thereafter became something of a mentor to him.

In October 1906, he went up to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, to study classics. There, he became a member of the Apostles, was elected as president of the university Fabian Society, helped found the Marlowe Society drama club and acted, including in the Cambridge Greek Play. The friendships he made at school and university set the course for his adult life, and many of the people he met—including George Mallory—fell under his spell. Virginia Woolf told Vita Sackville-West that she had gone skinny-dipping with Brooke in a moonlit pool when they were in Cambridge together. In 1907, his elder brother Dick died of pneumonia at age 26. Brooke planned to put his studies on hold to help his parents cope with the loss of his brother, but they insisted he return to university.

There is a blue plaque at The Orchard, Grantchester, where he lived and wrote. It reads: &quot;Rupert Brooke Poet &amp; Soldier 1887–1915 Lived and wrote at The Orchard 1909–1911, and at The Old Vicarage 1911–1912&quot;.

==Life and career==

Brooke made friends among the Bloomsbury group of writers, some of whom admired his talent while others were more impressed by his good looks. He also belonged to another literary group known as the Georgian Poets and was one of the most important of the Dymock poets, associated with the Gloucestershire village of Dymock where he spent some time before the war. This group included both Robert Frost and Edward Thomas. He also lived at the Old Vicarage, Grantchester, which stimulated one of his best-known poems, named after the house, written with homesickness while in Berlin in 1912. While travelling in Europe, he prepared a thesis, entitled &quot;John Webster and the Elizabethan Drama&quot;, which earned him a fellowship at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, in March 1913.

Brooke had his first heterosexual relationship with Élisabeth van Rysselberghe, daughter of painter Théo van Rysselberghe. They met in 1911 in Munich. His affair with Élisabeth came closest to be consummated than any other he ever had so far. It is possible that the two became lovers in a &quot;complete sense&quot; in May 1913 in Swanley. It was in Munich, where he had met Élisabeth, that a year later he finally succeeded in having intercourse with Ka Cox (Katherine Laird Cox).

Brooke suffered a severe emotional crisis in 1912, resulting in the breakdown of his long relationship with Ka Cox. Brooke&#x27;s paranoia that Lytton Strachey had schemed to destroy his relationship with Cox by encouraging her to see Henry Lamb precipitated his break with his Bloomsbury group friends and played a part in his nervous collapse and subsequent rehabilitation trips to Germany.

As part of his recuperation, Brooke toured the United States and Canada to write travel diaries for &quot;The Westminster Gazette&quot;. He took the long way home, sailing across the Pacific and staying some months in the South Seas. Much later it was revealed that he may have fathered a daughter with a Tahitian woman named Taatamata with whom he seems to have enjoyed his most complete emotional relationship. Many more people were in love with him. Brooke was romantically involved with the artist Phyllis Gardner and the actress Cathleen Nesbitt, and was once engaged to Noël Olivier, whom he met, when she was aged 15, at the progressive Bedales School.

Brooke&#x27;s accomplished poetry gained many enthusiasts and followers, and he was taken up by Edward Marsh, who brought him to the attention of Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty. He enlisted at the outbreak of war in August 1914. He was commissioned into the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as a temporary sub-lieutenant shortly after his 27th birthday, and was assigned to the Royal Naval Division, a branch of the Royal Navy but serving as an infantry unit. He took part in the Division&#x27;s Antwerp expedition in October 1914.

Brooke came to public attention as a war poet early the following year, when &quot;The Times Literary Supplement&quot; published two sonnets (&quot;IV: The Dead&quot; and &quot;V: The Soldier&quot;) on 11 March; the latter was then read from the pulpit of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on Easter Sunday (4 April). His most famous collection of poetry, containing all five sonnets, &quot;1914 &amp; Other Poems&quot;, was first published in May 1915 and, in testament to his popularity, ran to 11 further impressions that year and by June 1918 had reached its 24th impression, a process undoubtedly fuelled through posthumous interest.

==Death==
Brooke sailed with the British Mediterranean Expeditionary Force on 28 February 1915, but developed severe gastroenteritis whilst stationed in Egypt followed by streptococcal sepsis from an infected mosquito bite. French surgeons carried out two operations to drain the abscess, but he died of septicaemia at 4:46 pm on 23 April 1915, on the French hospital ship &quot;&quot;, moored in a bay off the Greek island of Skyros in the Aegean Sea, while on his way to the landings at Gallipoli. He was 27 at the time of his death. As the expeditionary force had orders to depart immediately, Brooke was buried at 11 pm in an olive grove on Skyros. The site was chosen by his close friend, William Denis Browne, who wrote of Brooke&#x27;s death:

Another friend and war poet, Patrick Shaw-Stewart, assisted at his hurried funeral. His grave remains there still, with a monument erected by his friend Stanley Casson, poet and archaeologist, who, in 1921, published &quot;Rupert Brooke and Skyros&quot;, a &quot;quiet essay&quot;, illustrated with woodcuts by Phyllis Gardner.

Brooke&#x27;s surviving brother, William Alfred Cotterill Brooke, fell in action on the Western Front on 14 June 1915 as a subaltern with the 1/8th (City of London) of the London Regiment (Post Office Rifles), at the age of 24. He had been in France on active service for nineteen days before his death. His body was buried in Fosse 7 Military Cemetery (Quality Street), Mazingarbe.

In July 1917, Field Marshal Edmund Allenby was informed of the death in action of his son Michael Allenby, leading to Allenby&#x27;s breakdown in tears in public while he recited a poem by Rupert Brooke.

==Commemorations==

On 11 November 1985, Brooke was among 16 First World War poets commemorated on a slate monument unveiled in Poets&#x27; Corner in Westminster Abbey. The inscription on the stone was taken from Wilfred Owen&#x27;s &quot;Preface&quot; to his poems and reads: &quot;My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity.&quot;

His name is recorded on the village war memorial in Grantchester.

The wooden cross that marked Brooke&#x27;s grave on Skyros, which was painted and carved with his name, was removed when a permanent memorial was made there. His mother, Mary Ruth Brooke, had the cross brought to Rugby, to the family plot at Clifton Road Cemetery. Because of erosion in the open air, it was removed from the cemetery in 2008 and replaced by a more permanent marker. The Skyros cross is now at Rugby School with the memorials of other Old Rugbeians.

The first stanza of &quot;The Dead&quot; is inscribed onto the base of the Royal Naval Division War Memorial in London.

The Cenotaph in Wellington, New Zealand, has the words from &quot;The Dead&quot;, &quot;These laid the world away; poured out the red Sweet wine of youth; gave up the years to be Of work and joy, and that unhoped serene, That men call age; and those who would have been, Their sons, they gave, their immortality&quot; inscribed on the pediment.

In 1988, the sculptor Ivor Roberts-Jones was commissioned to produce a statue of Brooke at Regent Place, a small triangular open space, in his birth town of Rugby, Warwickshire. The statue was unveiled by Mary Archer.

A 2006 portrait statue of Rupert Brooke in army uniform by Paul Day stands in the front garden of The Old Vicarage, Grantchester.
In 2023, artist Stephen Hopper painted a portrait in oils celebrating Brooke&#x27;s life and featuring references to his grave on Skyros and his service with the Hood Battalion, part of the 63rd (Royal Naval) Division. (See detail on the pencil poised in his hand and the blank sheet of paper, symbolising work unfulfilled). 

== Legacy ==

=== Literary influences ===
In the afterword of his &quot;Collected Poems&quot; (1919), Lord Alfred Douglas wrote: &quot;... never before in the history of English literature has poetry sunk so low. When a nation ... can seriously lash itself into enthusiasm over the puerile crudities (when they are nothing worse) of a Rupert Brooke, it simply means that poetry is despised and dishonoured and that sane criticism is dead or moribund.&quot;

American adventurer Richard Halliburton made preparations for writing a biography of Brooke but died before he could. Halliburton&#x27;s notes were used by Arthur Springer to write &quot;Red Wine of Youth: A Biography of Rupert Brooke&quot; (1921). Brooke was an inspiration to Canadian fighter pilot John Gillespie Magee Jr., known for his poems &quot;Sonnet to Rupert Brooke&quot; (1938) and &quot;High Flight&quot; (1941). Brooke also appears as a minor character in A. S. Byatt&#x27;s novel &quot;The Children&#x27;s Book&quot; (2009).

=== Musical influences ===
Frederick Septimus Kelly wrote his &quot;Elegy, In Memoriam Rupert Brooke for harp and strings&quot; after attending Brooke&#x27;s death and funeral. He also took Brooke&#x27;s notebooks containing important late poems for safekeeping and later returned them to England. Brooke&#x27;s poems have been set to music by groups and individuals including Charles Ives, Marjo Tal and Fleetwood Mac.

=== Quotes ===
Brooke&#x27;s poems are quoted in F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s debut novel &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; (1920), Princess Elizabeth&#x27;s Act of Dedication speech (1947), TV series including &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; episode &quot;Springtime&quot; (1974) and the second episode of &quot;&quot; (2022), as well as in films including &quot;Making Love&quot; (1982).

<text>Jérôme Bonaparte (born Girolamo Buonaparte; 15 November 1784 – 24 June 1860) was the youngest brother of Napoleon I and reigned as Jerome Napoleon I (formally Hieronymus Napoleon in German), King of Westphalia, between 1807 and 1813. 

From 1816 onward, he bore the title of Prince of Montfort. After 1848, when his nephew, Louis Napoleon, became President of the Second French Republic, he served in several official roles, including Marshal of France from 1850 onward, and President of the Senate in 1852. He was the only one of Napoleon&#x27;s siblings who lived long enough to see the Bonaparte restoration.

Historian Owen Connelly points to his financial, military, and administrative successes and concludes he was a loyal, useful, and soldierly asset to Napoleon. Others, including historian Helen Jean Burn, have demonstrated his military failures, including a dismal career in the French navy that nearly escalated into war with Britain over an incident in the West Indies, and his selfish concerns that led to the deaths of tens of thousands during the French invasion of Russia when he failed to provide military support as Napoleon had counted upon for his campaign. Further, Jérôme&#x27;s addiction to spending led to both personal and national financial disasters, with his large personal debts repeatedly paid by family members, including Napoleon, his mother, and both of his first two fathers-in-law. The treasury of Westphalia was emptied. In general, most historians agree that he was the most unsuccessful of Napoleon&#x27;s brothers.

==Early life==

Jérôme was born in Ajaccio, Corsica, the eighth and last surviving child (and fifth surviving son) of Carlo Buonaparte and his wife, Letizia Ramolino. His elder siblings were: Joseph Bonaparte, Napoleon Bonaparte, Lucien Bonaparte, Elisa Bonaparte, Louis Bonaparte, Pauline Bonaparte, and Caroline Bonaparte.

He studied at the Catholic College of Juilly and Lay College at the Irish College in Paris, and then joined the French Navy in January 1800. Napoleon put him in charge of a French frigate in the West Indies. Fleeing from an incident in which he accidentally shot a British ship and thus could have escalated conflict between the two countries, and fearing his brother&#x27;s wrath, he fled north under the assumed name of &quot;Mr. Albert&quot; to the United States, where he planned to remain until his brother&#x27;s temper cooled. While there, he amassed considerable debts and was nearly in a duel due to ruining at least one lady&#x27;s honour. Upon the boast by an old naval friend that Baltimore had the most beautiful women in the U.S., he made his way to that city (July 1803), where he met Elizabeth Patterson, reportedly the most beautiful woman in Baltimore. On Christmas Eve, 24 December 1803, nineteen-year-old Jérôme married Elizabeth Patterson (1785–1879), who herself was only eighteen. The wedding took place against the bride&#x27;s father&#x27;s wishes; William Patterson had received an anonymous letter beforehand which detailed Jérôme&#x27;s womanizing, his massive debts, and his plans to use the marriage only as a way to stay in style in the U.S. until he could return to his family in France.

Jérôme&#x27;s elder brother Napoleon was furious about the match - he wanted to marry his siblings into royal families across Europe and to expand the Bonaparte dynasty through marriage. He was unable to convince Pope Pius VII in Rome to annul the marriage, and so after becoming Emperor in 1804, he annulled the marriage himself (by a French imperial decree, on 11 March 1805), as a matter of state. At the time, Jérôme was on his way to Europe with Elizabeth, who was then pregnant. They landed in neutral Portugal, and Jérôme set off to Italy to persuade his brother to recognize the marriage. Elizabeth tried to land in Amsterdam, hoping to enter France so her baby would be born on French soil, but the Emperor barred the ship from entering the harbour. Elizabeth sailed to England instead, and gave birth to her child, Jérôme Napoléon Bonaparte (1805–1870), in London. Jérôme would not attempt to see his son for two decades.

The Emperor followed up his decree of divorce with Roman Catholic and (later) French state divorce proceedings. Jérôme submitted to the Emperor&#x27;s demands and ended his marriage; in return, he was made an admiral in the French navy (commanding the Genoa squadron from May 1805), a general in the army, King of Westphalia (), and an imperial prince, and Napoleon arranged marriage for him to a princess. Elizabeth returned alone to America with her son; she never spoke to Jérôme again. Fearing losing control of her son and her finances to Jérôme, Elizabeth was later declared divorced from Jérôme by a special decree and act of the Maryland General Assembly in 1815.

==King of Westphalia==
Napoleon made his brother King of Westphalia, a short-lived realm (1807–13) created from several states and principalities in northwestern Germany that had been in the Holy Roman Empire and were now reorganized by Napoleon into the Confederation of the Rhine.

The Napoleonic realm of Westphalia had its capital in Kassel (then: Cassel). Jérôme was married, as arranged by Napoleon before he was divorced from Elizabeth, to Princess Catharina of Württemberg, the daughter of Frederick I, King of Württemberg. A marriage to a German princess was intended to boost the dynastic standing of the young French king.

When Jérôme and Catharina arrived in Kassel, they found the palaces in a plundered state. As such, they placed orders for an array of stately furniture and expensive silverware with leading Parisian manufacturers. Local artisans, eager for commissions, oriented themselves with these French models. The king also intended to refurbish his capital architecturally, and the court theatre ranks among the small number of projects realised. Jérôme had it designed by Leo von Klenze and constructed next to the summer residence, previously known as &quot;Wilhelmshöhe&quot;, which was changed to &quot;Napoleonshöhe&quot;. To emphasize his rank as a ruler, and pander to his own ego, Jérôme commissioned grandiose state portraits of himself and his spouse, Queen Catharina. Other paintings were to celebrate his military exploits, with many of France&#x27;s most prominent painters taken into his employ. His careless spending continued and stripped the treasury of its funds, putting the new kingdom into debt. This reckless disregard for finances would continue for the rest of his life.

As a model state, the Kingdom of Westphalia was expected by Napoleon to serve as an example for the other German states. It received the first constitution and parliament to be found on German soil (decades before other parliaments, legislatures, reichstags, bundesrats, etc. such as in Frankfurt in 1848). Jérôme imported the Empire style from Paris, bestowing the new state with a modern, representative appearance. The small kingdom thus received more attention since the famous Treaty of Westphalia, which ended the Thirty Years&#x27; War a hundred and sixty years earlier in 1648. Thanks to these efforts by King Jerome, Kassel celebrated an enormous cultural upturn.

However, Jérôme&#x27;s expensive habits earned him the contempt of Napoleon and bankrupted his kingdom. His court incurred expenses comparable to Napoleon&#x27;s court (which oversaw a vastly larger and more important realm), and Napoleon refused to support Jérôme financially.

In 1812, Jérôme was given command of a corps in the &quot;Grande Armée&quot;, marching towards Minsk. Jérôme Insisted on travelling &quot;in state&quot;. Napoleon reprimanded Jerome for this, ordering him to leave his court and luxurious trappings behind. After the Battle of Mir (1812), Jérome occupied Mir Castle. In pique at Napoleon&#x27;s order, Jérôme returned with his entire court and train to Westphalia. As a result, tens of thousands of lives were most likely lost during the invasion of Russia. After the defeat in Russia during the following winter, Jerome petitioned Napoleon to allow his wife to go to Paris, fearing the advance of the Allied armies. On the second attempt, Napoleon granted permission.

Jérôme briefly re-entered the army in 1813, when his kingdom was being threatened from the east by the advancing allied Prussian and Russian armies during the German campaign of 1813. He led a small force to challenge their attempt at liberation. Following a clash with an enemy detachment, he made camp with his army, hoping for reinforcements from the French army in the west. However, before reinforcements arrived, the main allied force liberated the capital, Kassel. The Kingdom of Westphalia was declared dissolved, and Jérôme&#x27;s kingship ended. He then fled to join his wife, the former queen, in France. After Napoleon&#x27;s final defeat in 1815 during the War of the Seventh Coalition, the Allies would reorganize the former Westphalian territories along with the rest of the German states into a German Confederation with Austrian leadership.

==The Hundred Days==
During the Hundred Days, Napoleon placed Jérôme in command of the 6th Division of the II Corps under General Honoré Charles Reille. At Waterloo, Jérôme&#x27;s division was to make an initial attack on Hougoumont. It is said that Napoleon wished to draw in the Duke of Wellington&#x27;s reserves. Whatever the intent, Jérôme was allowed to enlarge the assault such that his division became completely engaged attempting to take Hougoumont to the exclusion of any other possible deployment, without significantly weakening Wellington&#x27;s centre. The episode became another in the long line of his military failures.

==Later years==

Although Catharina was aware of Jérôme&#x27;s womanizing and many affairs, she remained true to her husband. They had two sons, Prince Jérôme Napoléon Charles Bonaparte (1814–1847) and Prince Napoléon Bonaparte (1822–1891), also known as &quot;Prince Napoleon&quot; or &quot;Plon-Plon&quot;. Their second child was a daughter, Princess Mathilde Bonaparte, who was a prominent hostess during and after the Second French Empire of Napoleon III (1852–70).

After the dissolution of his kingdom, Jérôme was given the title of &quot;Prince of Montfort&quot; (French: &quot;prince de Montfort&quot;) by his father-in-law, King Frederick I of Württemberg, in July 1816. Previously, King Frederick had forced Jérôme and his wife to leave the country in 1814. During their exile, they visited the United States (his second time there). Jérôme later returned to France and joined Napoleon during an attempt to restore the Empire during the &quot;Hundred Days&quot;.

Later, Jérôme moved to Italy, where he married his third wife, Giustina Pecori-Suárez. She was the widow of an Italian Marquess, Luigi Bartolini-Baldelli and his mistress during his second marriage.

In 1848, his nephew, Prince Louis Napoleon, became President of the second French Republic. Jérôme was made Governor of Les Invalides in Paris, which was the burial place of Napoleon I--a position which provided a large salary for little work due to his debts and his complete lack of success at previous leadership endeavours. When Louis Napoleon became emperor as Napoleon III, Jérôme was recognized as the heir presumptive to the re-established imperial throne until the birth of Napoléon Eugène, Prince Imperial. Jérôme was named a Marshal of France in 1850, served as President of the Senate (the upper house in the French Republic&#x27;s parliament, compared with the lower house of the National Assembly) in 1852, and received the title of &quot;Prince Français&quot;.
Jérôme Bonaparte died on 24 June 1860, at Villegenis, France (today known as Massy in Essonne). He is buried in Les Invalides.

His grandson, Charles Joseph Bonaparte (son of Jerome &quot;Bo&quot; Napoleon Bonaparte, 1805–1870), served as United States Secretary of the Navy and United States Attorney General in President Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s administration, 1901–1909, and addressed the Supreme Court over 500 times. In 1908, he established a Bureau of Investigation within the 38-year-old Department of Justice. The bureau grew under director J. Edgar Hoover and was renamed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (F.B.I) in 1935.

Another grandson was Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte II, (1829–1893). In the early 1850s, he graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, was commissioned an officer in the United States Army, and served with the Mounted Rifles in Texas on the American southwestern frontier. He eventually resigned his commission and joined the forces of his cousin, the Emperor Napoleon III in his second French Empire.

Among Jérôme Bonaparte&#x27;s illegitimate children was Baroness Jenny von Gustedt, born as Jeromée Catharina Rabe von Pappenheim (1811–1890). She became the grandmother of the German Socialist and Feminist writer Lily Braun.

==In fiction and popular culture==
The 1923 German comedy film &quot;The Little Napoleon&quot; is loosely based around his life. He is played by Paul Heidemann.

In the &quot;Hornblower&quot; television series, he was portrayed by British actor David Birkin. The last episode (&quot;Duty&quot;) introduces Jérôme and Elizabeth (&#x27;Betsy&#x27;). Adrift in an open boat, they are picked up by Captain Hornblower&#x27;s ship; Jérôme poses as a harmless Swiss citizen, but Hornblower identifies him. After many diplomatic manoeuvres, the British government decides that Jérôme is of no political importance after all, and he is allowed to return to France while Elizabeth is put aboard a passing American ship.

Jerome and Betsy&#x27;s marriage is portrayed in the historical novel &quot;The Ambitious Madame Bonaparte&quot; by Ruth Hull Chatlien, published in 2013.

In the 1936 film &quot;Hearts Divided&quot;, Jerome was portrayed by Dick Powell. Elizabeth Patterson was played by Marion Davies, with Claude Rains as Napoleon.

<text>Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte (February 6, 1785 – April 4, 1879) was an American socialite. She was the daughter of Baltimore merchant William Patterson and the first wife of Jérôme Bonaparte, Napoleon&#x27;s youngest brother.

==Early life==
Patterson was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on February 6, 1785. She was the daughter of Dorcas (née Spear) Patterson and William Patterson, the oldest daughter of 13 children. Her mother was the daughter of a Baltimore flour merchant, and her father, an Irish-born Presbyterian who came to North America from Donegal before the Revolutionary War, was the second wealthiest man in Maryland after Charles Carroll of Carrollton. 

Although writers and journalists refer to her as Betsy, Patterson never used this name, and only her father with whom she had a contentious relationship used it; she always signed her name as Elizabeth, and Jérôme Bonaparte referred to her in all his letters with the French Élisabeth, Élisa or Elsa. Patterson was considered one of the more beautiful women in Baltimore and became known for her risqué and French taste in fashion.

Elizabeth&#x27;s brother, Robert Patterson, married Carroll&#x27;s granddaughter, Marianne Caton. After Robert&#x27;s death, his widow Marianne married Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley, the older brother of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington. Her other brothers, Joseph and Edward Patterson, were the owners of Joppa Iron Works in Eastern Baltimore County on the Gunpowder River.

==Personal life==
In 1803, Patterson met Jérôme Bonaparte on his visit to the United States; he had delayed his return to France to postpone facing the wrath of his brother Napoleon for a military incident in the Caribbean between his ship and a British ship. Several stories of their first meeting circulated, but Patterson later said that they met at a dinner at a friend&#x27;s house. A romance soon blossomed. Despite an anonymous letter to Patterson&#x27;s father which claimed that Bonaparte only planned to marry her in order to waste time until he returned to France, Patterson insisted on the marriage, going so far as to threaten to elope if she did not have her father&#x27;s blessing. On Christmas Eve, 1803, Patterson married Jérôme Bonaparte in a ceremony presided over by John Carroll, the first Catholic bishop of Baltimore.

Napoleon ordered his brother back to France and demanded that the marriage be annulled. Jérôme ignored Napoleon&#x27;s initial demand that he return without his wife. In the fall of 1804, Jérôme and a pregnant Elizabeth attempted to travel to France in time for his brother&#x27;s coronation, but a number of false starts delayed them. When they finally arrived, Elizabeth was denied permission to set foot on continental Europe by order of Napoleon. Jérôme traveled to Italy in an attempt to reason with his brother, writing to his wife &quot;My dearest Elsa, I will do everything that must be done,&quot; but she never saw him again except for a brief eye-to-eye contact in 1822 in a chance encounter at Pitti Palace in Florence (although, like many stories of her life, historians cannot prove this meeting took place).

After being prevented upon Napoleon&#x27;s orders from disembarking in either France or the Netherlands, she gave birth to a son, Jérôme Napoleon Bonaparte (1805–1870), on July 5, 1805, at 95 Camberwell Grove in Camberwell, London. Despite letters to his wife that he would remain steadfast and not abandon her, Jérôme acquiesed to his brother and was rewarded by being made an admiral in the French navy, a general in the army, an imperial prince and eventually king of Westphalia. He married the German princess Catharina of Württemberg on August 22, 1807, in the Royal Palace at Fontainebleau, France.

His marriage to Patterson had been annulled in France by machinations carried out by Napoleon in October 1806 despite the Pope&#x27;s unwillingness to annul the marriage.

After her son, whom she called Bo, was born, Patterson returned to Baltimore with him and lived with her father, while she continued to use her royal connection to support herself and her son. She wrote to Napoleon and convinced him to grant her an allowance, which she used to support herself after her father claimed what little money and goods Jerome had sent her from Europe before their marriage was annulled. After the Battle of Waterloo, she returned to Europe, where she reportedly was well received in the most exclusive circles and much admired for her beauty and wit.

=== Divorce and last years ===
In 1815, by special act of the Legislature of Maryland, Patterson secured a divorce. She returned to Europe again in 1819 with her son Bo, whom she enrolled in school in Geneva. She traveled to Rome during the winter of 1821–1822 at the behest of Pauline Bonaparte, who had hinted at making a financial settlement upon Bo. This news was welcome for Elizabeth as Jerome refused to provide for her and their son. After a failed attempt by Elizabeth and the Bonaparte women to arrange a marriage between Bo and Joseph Bonaparte&#x27;s youngest daughter Charlotte, she left Rome and returned to Geneva. During a stop in Florence, she visited the Pitti Palace, where she accidentally met Jerome and his second wife Catharina. The two did not speak, but witnesses confirmed that they saw each other and that Jerome was reported as telling Catharina that Elizabeth was his &quot;American wife.&quot; Jerome quickly left Florence shortly after the encounter. The two never saw each other again.

Elizabeth split the following decades between Europe and Baltimore, then finally returned to Baltimore. The rifts that had been present between Elizabeth and her family all her life were exacerbated by her marriage and her choices to pursue celebrity in both America and Europe rather than to be an obedient daughter. Her father&#x27;s rebuke of her in his will and a feud between her and her brothers over her father&#x27;s estate caused her permanent ostracization from the Patterson family. Her family strife was compounded by her anger at Bo&#x27;s choice of American heiress Susan Williams for a wife, a rift that never was resolved.

In 1861, she filed an inheritance claim in the Tribunal of First Instance at Paris after her former husband, Prince Jérôme, died on June 24, 1860. On February 15, 1861, the Tribunal of the Seine ruled that &quot;demands of Madame Elizabeth Patterson and her son, Jerome Bonaparte, are not admissible, and must be rejected.&quot;

Her last years were spent in Baltimore in the management of her estate, the value of which she increased to $1.5 million. She lived her last years in a Baltimore boarding house despite having enough money to have purchased a fine home. At the end of her life, she commented, &quot;Once I had everything but money; now I have nothing but money.&quot;

Patterson died on April 4, 1879, in Baltimore in the midst of a court battle over whether the state of Maryland could tax her out-of-state bonds. The case reached the Supreme Court (&quot;Bonaparte v. Tax Court&quot;, 104 U.S. 592). The court decided in favor of Maryland. She was interred in Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore. Her tomb bears an epitaph: &quot;After life&#x27;s fitful fever she sleeps well.&quot;

===Descendants===
Her son married Susan May Williams in 1829 and had two children, Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte II (1830–1893) and Charles Joseph Bonaparte (1851–1921), who became Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s Secretary of the Navy in 1905 and the U.S. Attorney General in 1906. Her granddaughter Louise Eugénie Bonaparte (1883-1923) married Count Adam von Moltke-Hvitfeldt (1864-1944). All Patterson&#x27;s direct descendants now live in Europe, and all of them belong to the Scandinavian aristocracy.

==In popular culture==
The story of Elizabeth and Jérôme&#x27;s marriage and annulment is the basis for the 1908 play &quot;Glorious Betsy&quot; by Rida Johnson Young and the two film adaptations, &quot;Glorious Betsy&quot; (1928) and &quot;Hearts Divided&quot; (1936). She was portrayed by Dolores Costello in the former and by Marion Davies in the latter. The episode &quot;Duty&quot; of the Hornblower television series features Elizabeth (played by Camilla Power) and Jérôme trying to land in France, and the diplomatic difficulties. A historical novel about her life, &quot;The Ambitious Madame Bonaparte&quot; by Ruth Hull Chatlien, was published in 2013.

Alexandra Deutsch, director of Collections and Interpretation at the Maryland Historical Society, analyzed Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte&#x27;s personal belongings and letters in the 2016 book &quot;A Woman of Two Worlds: Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte&quot;.

<text>Jérôme Napoléon &quot;Bo&quot; Bonaparte (5 July 1805 – 17 June 1870) was an American farmer, chairman of the Maryland Agricultural Society, first president of the Maryland Club, and the son of Elizabeth Patterson and Jérôme Bonaparte, brother of Napoleon I.

==Biography==
Bonaparte was born in 95 Camberwell Grove, Camberwell, London, but lived in the United States with his wealthy American mother, Elizabeth. His mother&#x27;s marriage had been annulled by order of Jérôme&#x27;s uncle, Napoleon I. The annulment caused the rescission of his right to carry the Bonaparte name, although the ruling was later reversed by his cousin, Napoleon III.

It is speculated that Jérôme&#x27;s prospective title is a reason the 11th Congress of the United States in 1810 proposed the Titles of Nobility Amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would strip an American of his citizenship if he accepted a title of nobility from a foreign nation. The amendment has never been approved, and lacked the approval of only two state legislatures at that time.

He graduated from Mount St. Mary&#x27;s College (now Mount St. Mary&#x27;s University) in 1817 and later received a law degree from Harvard, but did not end up practicing law. He was a founding member of the Maryland Club, serving as its first president.

In November 1829, Jérôme Napoleon married Susan May Williams, an heiress from Baltimore, and it is from them that the American line of the Bonaparte family descended. They had two sons: Jerome Napoleon Bonaparte II (1830–1893), who served as an officer in the armies of both the United States and France, and Charles Joseph Bonaparte (1851–1921), who became the United States Attorney General and Secretary of the Navy, and also created the Bureau of Investigation, which was later rechristened the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Jérôme Napoleon had refused to wait for an arranged marriage to a European princess, instead opting for the $200,000 fortune that Susan brought to the marriage. In an attempt to match the railroad heiress&#x27;s dowry, the groom&#x27;s maternal grandfather, William Patterson — one of the wealthiest men in Maryland — gave the couple Montrose Mansion as a wedding gift. Bonaparte died in Baltimore, Maryland, at age 64 and is buried at Loudon Park Cemetery.

<doc id="62360" wikidata="Q434077" url="?curid=62360" title="Prince Napoléon-Jérôme Bonaparte">
<text>Prince Napoléon Joseph Charles Paul Bonaparte (9 September 1822 – 17 March 1891), usually called Napoléon-Jérôme Bonaparte or Jérôme Bonaparte, was the second son of Jérôme, King of Westphalia, youngest brother of Napoleon I, and his second wife Catharina of Württemberg. Following the death of his cousin Louis-Napoléon, Prince Imperial in 1879, he claimed headship of the House of Bonaparte until his death in 1891. An outspoken liberal however, he was passed over as heir in his cousin&#x27;s final will, which instead chose his elder son Victor, who was favored by most Bonapartists. From the 1880s onwards, he was one of the stronger supporters of General Georges Boulanger, together with other monarchist forces.

As well as bearing the title of Prince Napoléon, given to him by his cousin Emperor Napoleon III in 1852,
he was also 2nd Prince of Montfort, 1st Count of Meudon and Count of Moncalieri, following his marriage with Maria Clotilde of Savoy in 1859. His popular nickname, Plon-Plon, stemmed from his difficulty in pronouncing his own name while still a child, although other notable historians and contemporary letters by his nephew Colonel Jérôme Bonaparte claim it was because he ran in cowardice during battle when the bombs fell. Another nickname, &quot;Craint-Plomb&quot; (&quot;Afraid-of-Lead&quot;,) was given to him by the army due to his absence from the Battle of Solferino.

== Biography ==
Born at Trieste in the Austrian Empire (today Italy), and known as &quot;Prince Napoléon&quot;, &quot;Prince Napoléon-Jérôme, or by the sobriquet of &quot;Plon-Plon&quot;, he was a close advisor to his first cousin, Napoleon III of France, and in particular was seen as a leading advocate of French intervention in Italy on behalf of Camillo di Cavour and the Italian nationalists. Until Napoleon III produced an heir apparent, the Bonaparte family were at odds for who should be the heir presumptive, a matter complicated by Jérôme Bonaparte&#x27;s first marriage to American Elizabeth Patterson Bonaparte, with whom he had a son, Jérôme Napoléon Bonaparte. A meeting of the Bonaparte family, presided over by Napoleon III, determined that while Jérôme Napoléon Bonaparte was not considered illegitimate, he would be excluded from the line of succession, making Prince Napoléon the heir presumptive.

An anti-clerical liberal, he led that faction at court and tried to influence the Emperor to anti-clerical policies, against the contrary influence of the Emperor&#x27;s wife, the Empress Eugénie, a devout Catholic and a conservative, and the patroness of those who wanted French troops to protect the Pope&#x27;s sovereignty in Rome. The Emperor was to navigate between the two influences throughout his reign.

When his cousin became president in 1848, Napoléon-Jérôme was appointed Minister Plenipotentiary to Spain. He later served in a military capacity as general of a division in the Crimean War, as Governor of Algeria, and as a corps commander in the French Army of Italy in 1859.
As part of his cousin&#x27;s policy of alliance with Piedmont-Sardinia, in 1859 Napoléon-Jérôme married Princess Maria Clotilde of Savoy, daughter of Victor Emmanuel II of Italy. However this did not prevent a nine-year relationship with the courtesan Cora Pearl.

When Louis-Napoléon, Prince Imperial died in 1879, Prince Napoléon-Jérôme became, genealogically, the most senior member of the Bonaparte family, but the Prince Imperial&#x27;s will excluded him from the succession, nominating Prince Napoléon-Jérôme&#x27;s son Victor as his successor. As a result, Prince Napoléon-Jérôme and his son quarreled for the remainder of Prince Napoléon-Jérôme&#x27;s life. In his final will, Napoléon-Jérôme excluded Victor as his heir, declaring him &quot;a traitor and a rebel&quot;, instead nominating his younger son Louis as his successor.

Prince Napoléon-Jérôme, upon being banished from France by the 1886 law exiling heads of the nation&#x27;s former ruling dynasties, settled at Prangins on the shores of Lake Geneva, in Vaud, Switzerland where, during the Second Empire, he had acquired a piece of property. The assets he left his heir were extremely modest: Besides the Villa Prangins and the adjoining estate of 75 hectares, estimated at 800,000 francs of the time, approximately 130 million of France&#x27;s old francs, they were limited to a portfolio valued at 1,000,000 (1891) francs, about 160 million old francs.

Prince Napoléon-Jérôme died in Rome in 1891, aged 68.

===Issue===
He and Princess Maria Clotilde had three children:
== Honours ==
* French Empire: Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour, 3 January 1853
* : Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold, 1 January 1854
* : Honorary Grand Cross of the Bath (military), &quot;5 September 1855&quot;
* Sweden-Norway:
** Grand Cross of St. Olav, 3 September 1856
** Knight of the Seraphim, 12 September 1856
* : Knight of the Elephant, 24 September 1856

== References in popular fiction ==
*Prince Napoléon-Jérôme takes a leading role in Robert Goddard&#x27;s novel &quot;Painting the Darkness&quot;. References are made to his role in the Crimean War and his son&#x27;s succession to the Bonapartist claim over him.
*Prince Napoléon-Jérôme is a minor character in Donald Serrell Thomas&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes novel &quot;Death on a Pale Horse&quot; (2013); Holmes and Dr. Watson are tasked with escorting him on a state visit to England as a possible claimant to the French throne after the death of his relative Napoléon, Prince Imperial in 1879.

<doc id="62361" wikidata="Q1336091" url="?curid=62361" title="Sable Island">
<text>Sable Island (, literally &quot;island of sand&quot;) is a small Canadian island situated southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia, and about southeast of the closest point of mainland Nova Scotia in the North Atlantic Ocean. The island is staffed year-round by three Parks Canada staff, rising during summer months when research projects and tourism increase. Notable for its role in early Canadian history and the Sable Island horse, the island is protected and managed by Parks Canada, which must grant permission prior to any visit. Sable Island is part of District 7 of the Halifax Regional Municipality in Nova Scotia. The island is also a protected National Park Reserve and an Important Bird Area.

==History==

===Early history===
The expedition of Portuguese explorer João Álvares Fagundes explored this region in 1520–1521 and his expedition was among the first Europeans to encounter the island. It is likely that he named the island &quot;Fagunda&quot; after himself. An island called &quot;Fagunda&quot; appears on later Portuguese maps placed to the southeast of Cape Breton, fairly near its present location; however, the identification of Sable Island with Fagunda is not certain. On the other hand, 16th-century Portuguese sources describe a fishing colony founded by the navigator in Cape Breton Island, further north. It is also possible that Fagundes sighted the island while heading southwest, reaching the Bay of Fundy, as the 1558 map of Diogo Homem and later Samuel de Champlain suggested, but this is unclear. The island was inhabited sporadically by sealers, shipwreck survivors, and salvagers known as &quot;wreckers&quot;.

Troilus de La Roche de Mesgouez attempted to colonize the New World with convicts in 1598. When the convicts mutinied, they were left on the treeless and stoneless Sable Island. Most of the settlers died, but a few managed to survive in mud dwellings for five years before being returned to France in 1603.

===Shipwrecks===
Sable Island is famous for its large number of shipwrecks. An estimated 350 vessels are believed to have fallen victim to the island&#x27;s sand bars. Thick fogs, treacherous currents, and the island&#x27;s location in the middle of a major transatlantic shipping route and rich fishing grounds account for the large number of wrecks. The first recorded wreck was the English ship in 1583, part of Humphrey Gilbert&#x27;s expedition to Newfoundland. There were at least three incidents of shipwrecks in the 1700s. In 1736, a well-known Presbyterian preacher, the Irish-born Revered Robert Dunlap (1715–1776), wrecked on the island on his way to America. Decades later, there were two major shipwrecks: In November 1760, Major Robert Elliot (1715 – after 1765) of the 43rd regiment was shipwrecked on Sable Island; he was rescued in January 1761. En route to Prince Edward Island under the command of Major Timothy Hierlihy, Lieutenant Anthony Kennedy and 25 men wrecked on the island in November 1778. The crew was stranded on the island for the winter. Two died, and the remainder were rescued and transported to Halifax the following April. It is likely that the construction of lighthouses on each end of the island in 1873 contributed to the decrease in shipwrecks.

The last major shipwreck was the steamship USS &quot;Manhasset&quot; in 1947. Her crew were all saved, the last significant rescue of the Sable lifesaving station. After the 1991 Perfect Storm, the commercial fishing vessel &quot;Andrea Gail&quot;″s emergency position-indicating radiobeacon (EPIRB) was discovered on the shore of Sable Island on November 6, 1991, nine days after the last transmission from the crew. Other items found were fuel drums, a fuel tank, an empty life raft, and some other flotsam. No crew members have been found, and all are presumed to have perished. No further wrecks occurred until 1999, when the three crew members of the yacht &quot;Merrimac&quot; survived after their sloop ran aground due to a navigational error. Few of the wrecks surrounding the island are visible, as they are usually crushed and buried by the sand. On July 12, 2024, the bodies of Briton Sarah Packwood and her Canadian husband Brett Clibbery were found in a lifeboat that washed up on Sable Island; they had left Nova Scotia June 11, 2024, on their sail yacht &quot;Theros&quot; trying to sail to the Azores and had been reported missing June 18, 2024.

===The Nova Scotia Rescue Station===
A series of life-saving stations were established on Sable Island by the governor of Nova Scotia, John Wentworth, in 1801. The rescue station began the continuous human presence on the island which continues today. Wentworth appointed James Morris, a Nova Scotian veteran of the British Royal Navy as the first superintendent of the island. Morris settled on the island in October 1801 with his family. By the time Morris died on the island in 1809, he had built up the humanitarian settlement to include a central station, two rescue boat stations, several lookout posts and survivor shelters. The station&#x27;s rescue equipment was upgraded in 1854 with the latest generation of self-bailing lifeboats and life cars through the fundraising efforts of social reformer Dorothea Dix who had visited the island in the previous year.

===After Confederation and creation of a weather station===
The island became property of the federal government during Canadian Confederation in 1867, with the Island being specifically referenced in an appendix to the British North America Act. The federal government later added two lighthouses in 1872: Sable Island East End Light (cylindrical skeletal tower built 1980s, replacing earlier iterations from 1873, 1888, 1917 and 1951) on the eastern tip and Sable Island West End Light (pyramidal skeletal tower built 1979 replacing earlier towers from 1873, 1903 and 1935) on the western end. Until the advent of modern ship navigation, Sable Island was home to the families of the life-saving crews and the lighthouse keepers. In the early 20th century, the Marconi Company established a wireless station on the island and the Canadian government similarly established a weather station. Several generations of island staff were born and raised families of their own on the island, although a decline in shipwrecks gradually reduced the size of the lifesaving community. Only two people have been born on Sable Island since 1920.

Improvements in navigation led to a dramatic drop in shipwrecks by the mid 20th century. As such, the rescue station on Sable was reduced and eventually closed in 1958. The Canadian Coast Guard (CCG) first automated in the 1960s and eventually decommissioned the West light station in 2004 leaving only the East lighthouse active. However, during this period, the island&#x27;s role in science grew, first in weather research. The Canadian government expanded the collection of weather data originally started by the rescue station into a full meteorological station operated by Environment and Climate Change Canada and Fisheries and Oceans Canada. The station conducted routine atmospheric and meteorological studies from a permanently occupied station on Sable Island until August 20, 2019. In addition to weather studies, research on the island expanded to a range of ecological and wildlife studies due to its unique position in the Atlantic.

Sable Island is specifically mentioned in the Constitution Act, 1867, formerly the British North America Act 1867, Part 4, Section 91 as being the special responsibility of the federal government (&quot;the exclusive Legislative Authority of the Parliament of Canada extends to ... 9. Beacons, Buoys, Lighthouses, and Sable Island&quot;). For this reason it is considered a separate amateur radio &quot;entity&quot; (equivalent to a country for award credit), and with visiting operations using the special call sign prefix CY0. Because it is a separate radio entity, Sable Island is a popular DX-pedition destination.

Out of concern for preserving the island&#x27;s frail ecology, all visitors to the island, including recreational boaters, require specific permission from Parks Canada. Sable Island&#x27;s heliport contains emergency aviation fuel for search and rescue helicopters, which use the island to stage further offshore into the Atlantic. When the Sable Offshore Energy Project was active, the island was designated as an emergency evacuation point for crews aboard nearby drilling rigs. In 2017, ExxonMobil began the plugging and abandonment of the production wells in the Thebaud field (the Sable Offshore Energy Project wells closest to Sable Island); all facilities were removed by November 2020.

===National Park===

On October 17, 2011, the Nova Scotia government entered into an agreement with the federal government to eventually protect the island as a national park. The news followed an announcement made by the federal government in May 2010, increasing the level of protection the island receives by transferring control from the Canadian Coast Guard to Parks Canada, which manages the island under the Canada National Parks Act. The establishment of the park reserve means that the island, and the surrounding area within , cannot be drilled for oil or natural gas.

Sable Island became a National Park Reserve on June 20, 2013, with approval of Mi&#x27;kmaq stakeholders. Full national park status has yet to be achieved, pending settlement of Indigenous land claims. The park is home to hundreds of species of flora and fauna including a breed of the unique Sable Island horse. The park is also a breeding ground for marine life.

In July 2016, a hike across Sable Island was added to Google Street View. Google worked with Parks Canada to add the interactive views of Sable and five other Canadian National Parks. The imagery was collected in September 2015 by a Parks Canada employee who carried a backpack version of the Street View car camera around an area on the centre of the island, part of Google&#x27;s Trekker program which explores off-road scenic locations. The route follows a hiking route that Parks Canada staff uses to escort adventure tourists who visit the island.

==Geography==
Sable Island is a narrow, crescent-shaped sandbar with a surface area estimated around . Despite being approximately long, it is only across at its widest point. The maximum elevation is about . The long crescent-shaped island rises gently from the shallows of the continental shelf approximately east of Halifax, Nova Scotia. Its location, in tandem with the area&#x27;s frequent fog and sudden strong storms (such as hurricanes and nor&#x27;easters), have resulted in over 350 recorded shipwrecks. It is often referred to as &quot;the Graveyard of the Atlantic&quot;, as it sits astride the great circle route from North America&#x27;s east coast to Europe. The nearest landfall is to the northwest near Canso, Nova Scotia.

Sable Island is believed to have formed from a terminal moraine deposited on the continental shelf near the end of the last Ice Age. It is slowly moving as waves erode the western shore and new sand is added on the eastern shore, and continually changing shape through the effects of strong winds and violent ocean storms.
The island has several freshwater ponds on the south side between the station and west light; however, in recent years their protecting dune-line has been eroded to such an extent that they are changing from one year to the next. In prior years, a brackish lake named Lake Wallace existed in the centre of the south beach. At its largest, it extended for many miles; indeed, during World War II, amphibious aircraft landed on it. Over the years, the lake shrank with an infilling of sand, until in late 2011, it filled in entirely and disappeared. Since the south beach is subject to flooding during fall storms, photos often show water in the area around the former location of Lake Wallace; however, this flooded area is relatively shallow (only a few feet at most) and is not a remnant of the lake. The original lake was of a significant enough depth that even during times when the area was flooded, the lake could be seen in aerial photographs as a darker (deeper) patch in the middle of the flooded area.

The island is a part of the Halifax Regional Municipality, the federal electoral district of Halifax, and the provincial electoral district of Halifax Citadel, although the urban area of Halifax proper is some away on the Nova Scotian mainland.

==Climate==
Sable Island has an Maritime temperate climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;) using the isotherm, or a warm-summer humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;) using the with its climate being strongly influenced by the sea. As such, winter temperatures average near freezing while during the summer months, daily maximum temperatures average around . The average annual variation in temperature on Sable Island is only owing to the influence from the sea compared to at Halifax and in Winnipeg. Generally, February is the coldest month while August is the warmest month.

Sable Island averages of precipitation a year, which is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year, though October through January are the wettest months due to frequent and intense fall and winter storms. Being located in the path of major frontal storms and tropical cyclones year-round, most of the precipitation comes from these storms. Thunderstorms are occasional, and happen on an average of 11 days per year. There are frequent heavy fogs in the area due to the contrasting effects of the cold Labrador Current and the warm Gulf Stream: on average there are 127 days out of the year that have at least 1 hour of fog. This makes Sable Island the foggiest place in the Maritimes. The foggiest season is during the summer months where July averages 22 fog days.

During the winter, Sable Island has the warmest temperatures in Canada apart from the Pacific Coast, and can have the warmest temperatures in the country on some occasions due to the influence of the Gulf Stream. Summers are among the coolest in southern Canada though. It is also the most hurricane-prone part of Canada, also due to the Gulf Stream, and is the only place where Saffir–Simpson scale Category 3 hurricane-force winds are likely in all of Canada. The highest temperature recorded was on August 27, 1951, while the lowest temperature recorded was on January 31, 1920.
According to Atlas Obscura, Sable Island lies in hardiness zone 8a () for plant hardiness.

===Climate change===
Being a large low-lying sandbar, Sable Island is vulnerable to sea level rise. This is further exacerbated by an ongoing increase in storm frequency and intensity caused by climate change, further eroding the island. These factors point toward Sable Island disappearing by the end of the 21st century. 

==Vegetation and wildlife==
Sable Island derived its name from the French word for &quot;sand&quot;. It lacks natural trees, being covered instead with marram grass and other low-growing vegetation. In 1901, the federal government planted over 80,000 trees in an attempt to stabilize the soil; all died. Subsequent plantings resulted in the survival of a single Scots pine. Although planted in the 1960s, it is only a few feet tall. It is decorated yearly as a Christmas tree in December as part of a tradition among the station staff.

The island is home to over 550 free-roaming horses according to a 2016 report, protected by law from human interference. During a 2017–2018 study, the estimated population was 500 horses, up from the roughly 300 recorded in the 1970s. Because of the harsh spring of 2017, the mortality rate was about 10% but the normal rate is about 1% annually, primarily due to starvation and hypothermia.

This feral horse population is likely descended from horses confiscated from Acadians during the Great Expulsion and left on the island by Thomas Hancock, Boston merchant and uncle of John Hancock. In the early 1800s, many of the horses were used by men patrolling the island, searching for ships in distress, and the animals also moved lifeboats and equipment to sites of shipwrecks.

In 1879, 500 horses and cattle were estimated to live on the island, and the island vegetation was described as covered with grass and wild peas. In the past, excess horses were rounded up, shipped off the island, and sold, many used in coal mines on Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia. In 1960, the Canadian Government, under the &quot;Canada Shipping Act&quot;, gave the horse population full protection from human interference. This was partly motivated by a plan in the 1950s, eventually aborted due to public pressure, to remove the horses from the island, after some biologists reported that they were damaging the ecology of the land. Nonetheless, some continued to view the horses as an invasive species which is not suitable in a protected region where ecological integrity should be preserved according to the National Parks Act.
Harbour and grey seals breed on the island&#x27;s shores. Seal counts from the 1960s for the grey seal population estimated 200–300 pups born at that time on the island, but surveys from as recent as 2016 estimated the number of pups born in that season at 87,500. The seals are occasionally preyed upon by the various shark species that inhabit the waters nearby. Unusual corkscrew bite wounds on dead seals suggest that the Greenland shark is probably responsible for most attacks here.

Several large bird colonies are resident, including the Arctic tern and Ipswich sparrow, a subspecies of the Savannah sparrow which breeds only on the island. Many other species are resident, migratory, or transient, blown out to sea in storms and returned to land out of their natural range.

It was formerly believed the freshwater sponge &quot;Heteromeyenia macouni&quot;, a freshwater sponge, was found only in ponds on the island. However, it is now considered to be the same species as &quot;Racekiela ryderi&quot;, found elsewhere.

Rabbits, cattle, and goats were also released on the island, with little success, at one point.

At one point, there was a walrus population on the island, until hunters drove it to extinction.

==Sable Island Station==
The Sable Island Station, managed and staffed by Parks Canada, is the only permanently staffed facility on the island. Climatological record-keeping on Sable Island began in 1871 with the establishment of the Meteorological Service of Canada, and ran continuously from 1891 until August 20, 2019.

Sable Island has been the subject of extensive scientific research over the years. The Meteorological Service of Canada operated a wide range of manual and automated instruments, including the Automated Weather Observing System, an aerology program measuring conditions in the upper atmosphere using a radiosonde carried aloft by a hydrogen-filled weather balloon to altitudes beyond , and a program collecting data on background levels of carbon dioxide, which began there in 1974. Research was done to monitor the long-range transport of pollution aerosols. Fog chemistry has also been studied, examining the transport and composition of atmospheric toxins it carries. Tropospheric ozone was measured and analyzed by researchers in Canada and the United States along with 20 other North American sites. The upper-air aerology program ended on August 20, 2019.
The installation of the BGS Magnetic Observatory on Sable Island was funded as a joint venture between the British Geological Survey, Sperry-Sun Drilling Services, and Sable Offshore Energy. The data it collects aid scientific research into rates of change of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field and increase the accuracy of the BGS Global Geomagnetic Model. Data from the geomagnetic observatory is used by the offshore energy industry for precise positioning activities such as directional drilling.

Supplies are delivered to the Sable Island Station approximately twice a month by Sable Aviation using a Britten-Norman Islander. Although the island has a heliport (CST5) with a diameter concrete pad. There is no permanent runway for fixed wing aircraft, which land instead on the south beach in an area designated as the Sable Island Aerodrome (CSB2). Prior permission is required to land, as the area is often unusable due to changing sand conditions.

==In popular culture==
The unique landscape, history of shipwrecks, and wildlife, especially horses, have made Sable Island an iconic place in Atlantic Canada and attracted considerable international following.

===In non-fiction===
Shipwreck survivors published early survival narratives about their experiences at Sable Island, beginning with the sinking of the &quot;Delight&quot; in 1583. The first formal history of the island, &quot;Sable Island: its History and Phenomena&quot;, was written in 1894 by George Patterson. Many other histories of the island and its shipwrecks have been published since, such as Lyall Campbell&#x27;s two books – &quot;Sable Island, Fatal and Fertile Crescent&quot; in 1974 and &quot;Sable Island Shipwrecks: Disaster and Survival at the North Atlantic Graveyard&quot; in 1994 – and more recently, &quot;A Dune Adrift: The Strange Origins and Curious History of Sable Island&quot;, written in 2004 by Marq de Villiers. In his 1997 book, &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;, Sebastian Junger briefly describes the geography and history of the island. Joshua Slocum describes Sable Island in &quot;Sailing Alone Around the World&quot; during his 1895 solo circumnavigation.

===In fiction===
The island has also inspired works of fiction beginning in 1802 when Nova Scotia author Thomas Chandler Haliburton published &quot;The Sable Island Ghost&quot;, a story about a ghostly woman inspired by the loss of the brig &quot;Francis&quot; in 1798. His story helped raise support for the establishment of a rescue station on the island. Canadian writer James Macdonald Oxley wrote a youth novel &quot;The Wreckers of Sable Island&quot; in 1897. Frank Parker Day&#x27;s 1928 novel &quot;Rockbound&quot; features a vivid depiction of the sinking of the schooner &quot;Sylvia Mosher&quot; during the 1926 Nova Scotia hurricane at Sable Island. One of the island&#x27;s most notable temporary residents was Nova Scotian author Thomas Head Raddall, whose early experiences working at the wireless post there served as the inspiration for his 1950 novel &quot;The Nymph and the Lamp&quot;. In his novel &quot;The Templar Throne,&quot; published in June 2010, author Paul Christopher mentions the island as the final location of the Ark of the Covenant, the True Ark of the Christian Old Testament.

===In photography===
The dunes and horses of Sable Island have drawn many photographers. Among the first was Arthur Williams McCurdy who photographed the island, its horses and shipwrecks in 1898 for &quot;National Geographic&quot; during a visit with Alexander Graham Bell. A further &quot;National Geographic&quot; visit in the summer of 1964 yielded an article entitled &quot;Sable Island; Graveyard of the Atlantic&quot;. In more recent times, Roberto Dutesco, a fashion photographer, began taking photos of Sable horses in 1994 and features this work in a permanent photo exhibition entitled &quot;Wild Horses of Sable Island&quot; at his gallery in New York. Nova Scotian photographer Paul Illsley&#x27;s photographs of Sable Island horses inspired both a Canadian stamp and coin in 2005.

===In music===
In 1970 Stompin&#x27; Tom Connors published his song &quot;Sable Island&quot; in 1970&#x27;s &quot;Stompin&#x27; Tom Meets Big Joe Mufferaw&quot;. Canadian folk singer Catherine McKinnon recorded a song arranged by Don Gillis also entitled &quot;Sable Island&quot; for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 1975. The first line of the Buck 65 song &quot;Blood of a Young Wolf&quot; is &quot;Ten thousand horses, Sable Island, endless summer.&quot;

===In documentaries===
The island has been the subject of many Canadian documentaries by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and the National Film Board of Canada, beginning with the 1956 NFB film &quot;Sable Island&quot; by Allan Wargon, the 2003 NFB documentary &quot;Moving Sands&quot; by Phillipe Baylaucq, and more recently, an episode of &quot;Land and Sea&quot;. In 2002 a documentary was released called &quot;Catching a Killer: The Mystery of Sable Island&quot; which investigated the possibility that Greenland sharks were to blame for the corkscrew lacerations on dead seals found washed up on the island. A recent work about Sable Island is the 2015 Canadian-produced film, &quot;S(t)able Island: The Beauty of the Free&quot;, created by Rae-Anne LaPlante. The film explores in-depth the wild horse population that has called Sable Island its home for over 250 years. A number of international documentaries have also explored the island, including the 2007 film made by Jean-François Ducrocq and Malek Sahraoui for France 3, French public television. In 2007, Matt Trecartin of Halifax directed &quot;Chasing Wild Horses&quot;, a documentary about photographer Roberto Dutesco and his photography of the Sable Island horses.
The most recent effort is a Canadian documentary film by Jacquelyn Mills, titled &quot;Geographies of Solitude&quot;, released in 2022. The 103-minute film features Zoe Lucas, an environmentalist and naturalist who lives on the island and studies the wild Sable Island horse.

===In other films===
In the 1937 film &quot;Captains Courageous&quot;, the fishing boat passes Sable Island on the way to the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. Spencer Tracy&#x27;s character Manuel later says his father died off Cape Sable. Sable Island is briefly featured in the 2000 feature film &quot;The Perfect Storm&quot;, which depicts the sinking of the fishing vessel &quot;Andrea Gail&quot; near Sable, although the island is erroneously portrayed with trees and a giant stone lighthouse. Sable Island is the setting for the 2002 film &quot;Touching Wild Horses&quot; starring Jane Seymour; however, little attempt was made to mimic the natural landscape of Sable, with trees and rocks abounding in the background of most every scene. Instead, Sandbanks Provincial Park in Ontario stood in for the island in the film.

===In exhibits===
A permanent exhibit about Sable Island is featured at the Maritime Museum of the Atlantic in Halifax, which includes two rescue boats from Sable and numerous name boards and figureheads from Sable Island wrecks. Another permanent exhibit about Sable Island, exploring its ecology and the on-island researchers&#x27; work, is found at the Nova Scotia Museum of Natural History. The horses were featured in a 1994 exhibit at the Equine Museum of Japan in Yokohama.

===On radio===
On September 11, 2014, Don Connolly of CBC Radio&#x27;s Information Morning broadcast part of the daily current affairs program from Sable Island. It was the first ever live public radio broadcast from the island.

In amateur radio, Sable Island is considered a separate country with the unique call sign prefix CY0. Since enthusiasts collect contacts from different countries and there are few inhabitants on Sable Island, a contact from there would be considered a &quot;rare DX&quot;. As a result, a number of private expeditions (known as DX-peditions) to operate temporary radio stations on Sable Island have been mounted. The most recent DX-pedition is CY0S, which took place in March 2023. There have also been DXpeditions in October 2012 (CY0), March 2011 (CY0), July 2008 (CY0X), November 2002 (CY0MM), October 1995 (CY0TP), and October 1975 (VX9A).

<doc id="62363" wikidata="Q335060" url="?curid=62363" title="James Boswell">
<text>James Boswell, 9th Laird of Auchinleck (; 29 October 1740 (N.S.) – 19 May 1795), was a Scottish biographer, diarist, and lawyer, born in Edinburgh. He is best known for his biography of the English writer Samuel Johnson, &quot;Life of Samuel Johnson,&quot; which is commonly said to be the greatest biography written in the English language. A great mass of Boswell&#x27;s diaries, letters, and private papers were recovered from the 1920s to the 1950s, and their publication by Yale University has transformed his reputation.

==Early life==
Boswell was born in Blair&#x27;s Land on the east side of Parliament Close behind St Giles&#x27; Cathedral in Edinburgh on 29 October 1740 (N.S.). He was the eldest son of a judge, Alexander Boswell, Lord Auchinleck, and his wife Euphemia Erskine. As the eldest son, he was heir to his family&#x27;s estate of Auchinleck in Ayrshire. Boswell&#x27;s mother was a strict Calvinist, and he felt that his father was cold to him. As a child, he was delicate. Kay Jamison, Professor of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins, in her book &quot;Touched with Fire&quot;, believes that Boswell may have suffered from bipolar disorder, and this condition would afflict him sporadically all through his life. At the age of five, he was sent to James Mundell&#x27;s academy, an advanced institution by the standards of the time, where he was instructed in English, Latin, writing and arithmetic.

The eight-year-old Boswell was unhappy there, and suffered from nightmares and extreme shyness. Consequently, he was removed from the academy and educated by a string of private tutors. The most notable and supportive of these, John Dunn, exposed Boswell to modern literature, such as &quot;The Spectator&quot; essays, and religion. Dunn was also present during Boswell&#x27;s serious affliction of 1752, when he was confined to the town of Moffat in northern Dumfriesshire. This afforded Boswell his first experience of genuine society. His recovery was rapid and complete, and Boswell may have decided that travel and entertainment exerted a calming therapeutic effect on him.

At thirteen, Boswell was enrolled into the arts course at the University of Edinburgh, studying there from 1753 to 1758. Midway through his studies, he suffered an episode of serious depression but recovered fully. Boswell had swarthy skin, black hair and dark eyes; he was of average height, and he tended to plumpness. His appearance was said to be alert and masculine.

Upon turning nineteen, he was sent to continue his studies at the University of Glasgow, where he attended the lectures of Adam Smith. While at Glasgow, Boswell decided to convert to Catholicism and become a monk. Upon learning of this, his father ordered him home. Instead of obeying, though, Boswell ran away to London, where he spent three months, living the life of a libertine, before he was taken back to Scotland by his father. Upon returning, he was re-enrolled at Edinburgh University and forced by his father to sign away most of his inheritance in return for an allowance of £100 a year.

== To London and Europe ==
On 30 July 1762, Boswell passed his oral law exam, after which his father decided to raise his allowance to £200 a year and permitted him to return to London. Boswell had started keeping a careful journal, written in full, and the volume covering this period was published in 1950 as the &quot;London Journal&quot;. On 16 May 1763, Boswell met Johnson for the first time. The pair became friends almost immediately, though Johnson became more of a parental figure in Boswell&#x27;s eyes. 

In Boswell&#x27;s &quot;Life of Johnson&quot;, he records the first conversational exchange between himself and Johnson as follows:

[Boswell:] &quot;Mr Johnson, I do indeed come from Scotland, but I cannot help it.&quot;
[Johnson:] &quot;That, Sir, I find, is what a very great many of your countrymen cannot help.&quot;

On 6 August, Boswell departed England for Europe, with the initial goal of continuing his law studies at Utrecht University. He spent a year there and although desperately unhappy the first few months, eventually quite enjoyed his time in Utrecht. He mixed with prominent families, and pursued his studies industriously. Boswell admired the young widow Geelvinck who refused to marry him. He befriended and fell in love with Isabelle de Charrière, also known as Belle van Zuylen, a vivacious young Dutchwoman of unorthodox opinions, his social and intellectual superior. 

On 18 June 1764, Boswell set out from Utrecht by coach, and spent most of the next two years travelling around the continent, his Grand Tour. He travelled through Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Corsica and France. He arranged to meet European intellectuals Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Voltaire with a recommendation letter of Constant d&#x27;Hermenches, and made a pilgrimage to Rome, where his portrait was painted by George Willison. Boswell also travelled to Corsica and spent seven weeks there, meeting the Corsican resistance leader Pasquale Paoli, and sending reports to London newspapers. His diaries and correspondence of this time have been compiled into two books, &quot;Boswell in Holland&quot; and &quot;Boswell on the Grand Tour&quot;.

==Mature life==

Boswell returned to London in February 1766 accompanied by Rousseau&#x27;s mistress Thérèse Levasseur, with whom he had a brief affair on the journey home. After spending a few weeks in the capital, he returned to Scotland, buying (or perhaps renting) the former house of David Hume on James Court on the Lawnmarket. He studied for his final law exam at Edinburgh University. He passed the exam and became an advocate. He practised the law in Edinburgh for over a decade, and most years spent his annual break in London, mingling with Johnson and many other London-based writers, editors, and printers, and furthering his literary ambitions. He contributed a great many items to newspapers and magazines, in London and Edinburgh. He found enjoyment in playing the intellectual rhyming game crambo with his peers.

In 1768 he published &quot;An account of Corsica, the journal of a tour to that island, and memoirs of Pascal Paoli.&quot; The book contained both a history and description of Corsica, as well as an account of his visit. Boswell was a major supporter of the Corsican Republic. Following the island&#x27;s invasion by France in 1768, Boswell attempted to raise public awareness and rally support for the Corsicans. He sent arms and money to the Corsican fighters, who were ultimately defeated at the Battle of Ponte Novu in 1769. Boswell attended the masquerade held at the Shakespeare Jubilee in Stratford-upon-Avon in September 1769 dressed as a Corsican Chief. He was also, much to the chagrin of his friend Johnson, a strong defender of the American Revolution.

Some of his journal entries and letters from this period describe his amatory exploits. Thus, in 1767, in a letter to William Johnson Temple, he wrote, &quot;I got myself quite intoxicated, went to a Bawdy-house and past a whole night in the arms of a Whore. She indeed was a fine strong spirited Girl, a Whore worthy of Boswell if Boswell must have a whore.&quot; A few years earlier, he wrote that during a night with an actress named Louisa, &quot;five times was I fairly lost in supreme rapture. Louisa was madly fond of me; she declared I was a prodigy and asked me if this was not extraordinary for human nature.&quot; Though he sometimes used a condom for protection, he contracted venereal disease at least seventeen times.

Boswell married his cousin, Margaret Montgomerie, on 25 November 1769. She remained faithful to Boswell, despite his frequent liaisons with prostitutes, until her death from tuberculosis in 1789. After his infidelities, he would deliver tearful apologies to her and beg her forgiveness, before again promising her, and himself, that he would reform. James and Margaret had four sons and three daughters. Two sons died in infancy; the other two were Alexander (1775–1822) and James (1778–1822). Their daughters were Veronica (1773–1795), Euphemia (1774 – c. 1834) and Elizabeth, known as &#x27;Betsy&#x27;, (1780–1814). Boswell also had at least two extramarital children, Charles (1762–1764) and Sally (1767 – c. 1768).

Despite his relative literary success with accounts of his European travels, Boswell was only a moderately successful advocate, with the exception of the copyright infringement case of &quot;Donaldson v Beckett&quot;, where Boswell represented the Scottish bookseller Alexander Donaldson. By the late 1770s, Boswell descended further and further into alcoholism and gambling addiction. Throughout his life, from childhood until death, he was beset by severe swings of mood. His depressions frequently encouraged and were exacerbated by his various vices. His happier periods usually saw him relatively vice-free. His character mixed a superficial Enlightenment sensibility for reason and taste with a genuine and somewhat romantic love of the sublime and a propensity for occasionally puerile whimsy. The latter, along with his tendency for drink and other vices, caused many contemporaries and later observers to regard him as being too lightweight to be an equal in the literary crowd that he wanted to be a part of. However, his humour and innocent good nature won him many lifelong friends.

In 1773 Boswell bought the house of David Hume (who moved to a new house on South St David Street/St Andrew Square) on the south east corner of James Court. He lived there until 1786. Boswell&#x27;s residency at James Court has been well established, but not the exact location. For example, a later edition of &quot;Traditions of Edinburgh&quot; by Robert Chambers suggests that Boswell&#x27;s residence at James Court was actually in the Western wing. His James Court flat was notable for having two levels, and although a modern renovation in the Eastern section reveals such a possibility, it is likely that Boswell&#x27;s residence was a similarly equipped one in the Western section that no longer exists, having burned down in the mid 1800s.

===Earl of Dumfries===

Boswell became quite friendly with the 6th Earl of Dumfries. As well as seeing him in Scotland, he also visited him in Rosemount, London in 1787 and 1788.
In Boswell&#x27;s journal of November 2, 1778, he writes, &quot;[The Earl of Dumfries] was exceedingly attentive to me [...] I was upon my guard, as I well knew that he and his Countess flattered themselves that they would get from me that road through our estate which my father had refused, and which in truth I was still more positive for refusing&quot;. He saw the Earl as &quot;“very attentive”&quot;.

Having hosted the Earl, Boswell and his wife also decide to visit Dumfries House &quot;[o]ur visit was a little awkward, as there had been no communication between the families for several of the last years of my father&#x27;s life [...] I, however, wished to live on civil terms with such near neighbours&quot;.

On October 27, 1782, Boswell writes, &quot;we looked at Lord Dumfries&#x27;s gate and the famous road. [...] I showed him that granting it would make the Auchinleck improvements appear part of the Earl of Dumfries&#x27;s domains. [...] If Lord Eglinton – if my Earl – were Earl of Dumfries and living at Dumfries House, he should have the road, but not to him and his heirs.&quot;

===Later life===
Boswell was a frequent guest of Lord Monboddo at Monboddo House, a setting where he gathered significant observations for his writings by association with Samuel Johnson, Lord Kames and other notable attendees.

After Johnson&#x27;s death in 1784, Boswell moved to London to try his luck at the English Bar, which proved even less successful than his career in Scotland. In 1792 Boswell lobbied the Home Secretary to help gain royal pardons for four Botany Bay escapees, including Mary Bryant. He also offered to stand for Parliament but failed to get the necessary support, and he spent the final years of his life writing his &quot;Life of Samuel Johnson&quot;. 

During this time his health began to fail due to venereal disease and his years of drinking. Boswell died in London in 1795. Close to the end of his life he became strongly convinced that the &quot;Shakespeare papers&quot;, including two previously unknown plays &quot;Vortigern and Rowena&quot; and &quot;Henry II&quot;, allegedly discovered by William Henry Ireland, were genuine. After Boswell&#x27;s death they proved to be forgeries created by Ireland himself. Boswell&#x27;s remains were interred in the crypt of the Boswell family mausoleum in what is now the old Auchinleck Kirkyard in Ayrshire. The mausoleum is attached to the old Auchinleck kirk.

== &quot;Life of Samuel Johnson&quot; ==
When the &quot;Life of Samuel Johnson&quot; was published in 1791, its style was unique in that, unlike other biographies of that era, it directly incorporated conversations that Boswell had noted down at the time for his journals. He also included more personal and human details than those to which contemporary readers were accustomed. Instead of writing a strictly fact-based record of Johnson&#x27;s public life in the style of the time, he painted a more personal and intimate portrait of the man than was normal in biographies of the day.

Macaulay and Carlyle, among others, have attempted to explain how a man such as Boswell could have produced a work as detailed as the &quot;Life of Johnson&quot;. The former argued that Boswell&#x27;s uninhibited folly and candour were his greatest qualifications; the latter replied that beneath such traits was a mind to discern excellence and a heart to appreciate it, aided by the power of accurate observation and considerable dramatic ability.

== Position on slavery ==
Boswell was present at the meeting of the Committee for the Abolition of the Slave Trade in May 1787 set up to persuade William Wilberforce to lead the abolition movement in Parliament. However, the abolitionist Thomas Clarkson records that by 1788 Boswell &quot;after having supported the cause ... became inimical to it&quot;.
Boswell&#x27;s most prominent display of support for slavery was his 1791 poem &quot;No Abolition of Slavery; or the Universal Empire of Love&quot;, which lampooned Clarkson, Wilberforce and Pitt. The poem also supports the common suggestion of the pro-slavery movement, that the slaves actually enjoyed their lot: &quot;The cheerful gang! – the negroes see / Perform the task of industry.&quot;

==Discovery and publication of Boswell&#x27;s private papers==
In the 1920s a great part of Boswell&#x27;s private papers, including intimate journals for much of his life, were discovered at Malahide Castle, north of Dublin. These provide a hugely revealing insight into the life and thoughts of the man. They were sold to the American collector Ralph H. Isham and have since passed to Yale University, which has published popular and scholarly editions of his journals and correspondence, mostly edited by Frederick A. Pottle. A second cache was discovered soon after and also purchased by Isham. A substantially longer edition of &quot;The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides&quot; was published in 1936 based on his original manuscript, edited by L. F. Powell. His &quot;London Journal 1762–63&quot;, the first of the Yale journal publications, appeared in 1950. The last popular edition, &quot;The Great Biographer, 1789–1795&quot;, was published in 1989. Publication of the research edition of Boswell&#x27;s journals and letters, each including never before published material, was ceased by Yale University in June 2021, prior to the completion of the project.

These detailed and frank journals include voluminous notes on the Grand Tour of Europe that he took as a young man and, subsequently, of his tour of Scotland with Johnson. His journals also record meetings and conversations with eminent individuals belonging to The Club, including Lord Monboddo, David Garrick, Edmund Burke, Joshua Reynolds and Oliver Goldsmith.

It is since the discovery of these journals that Boswell has become recognized as a major literary artist. In his openness to every nuance of feeling, his delicacy in capturing fugitive sentiments and revealing gestures, his comic self-regard and (at times) self-contempt, Boswell was willing to express what other authors of the time repressed.

==Freemasonry==
Boswell was initiated into Freemasonry in Lodge Canongate Kilwinning on 14 August 1759. He subsequently became Master of that Lodge in 1773 and in that year was Senior Grand Warden of the Grand Lodge of Scotland. From 1776 to 1777 he was the Depute Grand Master of that Grand Lodge.

== In fiction and popular culture ==

Boswell&#x27;s surname has passed into the English language as a term (&quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;) for a constant companion and observer, especially one who records those observations in print. In &quot;A Scandal in Bohemia&quot;, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s character Sherlock Holmes affectionately says of Dr. Watson, who narrates the tales, &quot;I am lost without my Boswell.&quot;

The comedy &quot;Young Auchinleck&quot; (1962) by Scottish playwright Robert McLellan depicts Boswell&#x27;s various courtships and troubled relations with his father in the period after his return to Scotland in 1766, culminating in his eventual marriage to his cousin Margaret Montgomery (Peggy) in 1769 on the same day as his father&#x27;s second marriage in a different part of the country. The play was first produced at the Edinburgh International Festival in 1962 and adapted for BBC Television in 1965.

In 1981 the cartoonist R. Crumb published the piece &quot;Boswell&#x27;s London Journal&quot; in the anthology magazine &quot;Weirdo&quot;. Presented as a &quot;Klassic Komic,&quot; the piece featured meticulous cross-hatched illustrations and excerpts from Boswell&#x27;s writing to tell a satirical story of the young Boswell attempting to establish himself in London society, dallying with prostitutes and suffering from venereal disease.

Boswell was played by John Sessions in &quot;Boswell &amp; Johnson&#x27;s Tour of the Western Isles&quot;, a 1993 BBC 2 play.

In February and March 2015, BBC Radio 4 broadcast three episodes of &quot;Boswell&#x27;s Lives&quot;, writer Jon Canter&#x27;s comedic take on Boswell meeting later historical figures (Sigmund Freud, Maria Callas and Harold Pinter, respectively) for the purposes of biographing them. Boswell was played by Miles Jupp.

American novelist Philip Baruth wrote a fictional account of James Boswell&#x27;s early life in &quot;The Brothers Boswell&quot; (Soho Press 2009). The novel, which includes scenes that feature Samuel Johnson, is a thriller that focuses on the tense relationship between James and his younger brother John. Boswell also features as a character in James Robertson&#x27;s novel, &quot;Joseph Knight&quot; (2003).

<doc id="62366" wikidata="Q452969" url="?curid=62366" title="Moa">
<text>Moa (order Dinornithiformes) are an extinct group of flightless birds formerly endemic to New Zealand. During the Late Pleistocene-Holocene, there were nine species (in six genera). The two largest species, &quot;Dinornis robustus&quot; and &quot;Dinornis novaezelandiae&quot;, reached about in height with neck outstretched, and weighed about while the smallest, the bush moa (&quot;Anomalopteryx didiformis&quot;), was around the size of a turkey. Estimates of the moa population when Polynesians settled New Zealand circa 1300 vary between 58,000 and approximately 2.5 million.

Moa are traditionally placed in the ratite group. However, genetic studies have found that their closest relatives are the flighted South American tinamous, once considered a sister group to ratites. The nine species of moa were the only wingless birds, lacking even the vestigial wings that all other ratites have. They were the largest terrestrial animals and dominant herbivores in New Zealand&#x27;s forest, shrubland, and subalpine ecosystems until the arrival of the Māori, and were hunted only by Haast&#x27;s eagle. Moa extinction occurred within 100 years of human settlement of New Zealand, primarily due to overhunting.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;moa&quot; is a Polynesian term for domestic fowl. The name was not in common use among the Māori by the time of European contact, likely because the bird it described had been extinct for some time, and traditional stories about it were rare. The earliest record of the name was by missionaries William Williams and William Colenso in January 1838; Colenso speculated that the birds may have resembled gigantic fowl. In 1912, Māori chief Urupeni Pūhara claimed that the moa&#x27;s traditional name was &quot;te kura&quot; (the red bird).

==Description==
Moa skeletons were traditionally reconstructed in an upright position to create impressive height, but analysis of their vertebral articulations indicates that they probably carried their heads forward, in the manner of a kiwi. The spine was attached to the rear of the head rather than the base, indicating the horizontal alignment. This would have let them graze on low vegetation, while being able to lift their heads and browse trees when necessary. This has resulted in a reconsideration of the height of larger moa. However, Māori rock art depicts moa or moa-like birds (likely geese or adzebills) with necks upright, indicating that moa were capable of assuming both neck postures.

No records survive of what sounds moa made, though some idea of their calls can be gained from fossil evidence. The trachea of moa were supported by many small rings of bone known as tracheal rings. Excavation of these rings from articulated skeletons has shown that at least two moa genera (&quot;Euryapteryx&quot; and &quot;Emeus&quot;) exhibited tracheal elongation, that is, their trachea were up to long and formed a large loop within the body cavity. They are the only ratites known to exhibit this feature, which is also present in several other bird groups, including swans, cranes, and guinea fowl. The feature is associated with deep resonant vocalisations that can travel long distances.

==Evolutionary relationships==
The moa&#x27;s closest relatives are small terrestrial South American birds called the tinamous, which can fly. Previously, the kiwi, the Australian emu, and cassowary were thought to be most closely related to moa.

Although dozens of species were described in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many were based on partial skeletons and turned out to be synonyms. Currently, 11 species are formally recognised, although recent studies using ancient DNA recovered from bones in museum collections suggest that distinct lineages exist within some of these. One factor that has caused much confusion in moa taxonomy is the intraspecific variation of bone sizes, between glacial and interglacial periods (see Bergmann’s rule and Allen’s rule), as well as sexual dimorphism being evident in several species. &quot;Dinornis&quot; seems to have had the most pronounced sexual dimorphism, with females being up to 150% as tall and 280% as heavy as males—so much bigger that they were classified as separate species until 2003. A 2009 study showed that &quot;Euryapteryx curtus&quot; and &quot;E. gravis&quot; were synonyms. A 2010 study explained size differences among them as sexual dimorphism. A 2012 morphological study interpreted them as subspecies, instead.

Analyses of ancient DNA have determined that a number of cryptic evolutionary lineages occurred in several moa genera. These may eventually be classified as species or subspecies; &quot;Megalapteryx benhami&quot; (Archey) is synonymised with &quot;M. didinus&quot; (Owen) because the bones of both share all essential characters. Size differences can be explained by a north–south cline combined with temporal variation such that specimens were larger during the Otiran glacial period (the last ice age in New Zealand). Similar temporal size variation is known for the North Island&#x27;s &quot;Pachyornis mappini&quot;. Some of the other size variation for moa species can probably be explained by similar geographic and temporal factors.

The earliest moa remains come from the Miocene Saint Bathans Fauna. Known from multiple eggshells and hind limb elements, these represent at least two already fairly large-sized species.

===Phylogeny===

Because moa are a group of flightless birds with no vestiges of wing bones, questions have been raised about how they arrived in New Zealand, and from where. Many theories exist about the moa&#x27;s arrival and radiation in New Zealand, but the most recent theory suggests that they arrived in New Zealand about 60 million years ago (Mya) and split from the &quot;basal&quot; (see below) moa species, &quot;Megalapteryx&quot;, about 5.8 Mya instead of the 18.5 Mya split suggested by Baker et al. (2005). This does not necessarily mean there was no speciation between the arrival 60 Mya and the basal split 5.8 Mya, but the fossil record is lacking and most likely the early moa lineages existed, but became extinct before the basal split 5.8 Mya. The presence of Miocene-aged species certainly suggests that moa diversification began before the split between &quot;Megalapteryx&quot; and the other taxa.

The Oligocene Drowning Maximum event, which occurred about 22 Mya, when only 18% of present-day New Zealand was above sea level, is very important in the moa radiation. Because the basal moa split occurred so recently (5.8 Mya), it was argued that ancestors of the Quaternary moa lineages could not have been present on both the South and North Island remnants during the Oligocene drowning. This does not imply that moa were previously absent from the North Island, but that only those from the South Island survived, because only the South Island was above sea level. Bunce et al. (2009) argued that moa ancestors survived on the South Island and then recolonised the North Island about 2 Myr later, when the two islands rejoined after 30 Myr of separation. The presence of Miocene moa in the Saint Bathans fauna seems to suggest that these birds increased in size soon after the Oligocene drowning event, if they were affected by it at all.

Bunce et al. also concluded that the highly complex structure of the moa lineage was caused by the formation of the Southern Alps about 6 Mya, and the habitat fragmentation on both islands resulting from Pleistocene glacial cycles, volcanism, and landscape changes. The cladogram below is a phylogeny of Palaeognathae generated by Mitchell (2014) with some clade names after Yuri &quot;et al.&quot; (2013). It provides the position of the moa (Dinornithiformes) within the larger context of the &quot;ancient jawed&quot; (Palaeognathae) birds:

The cladogram below gives a more detailed, species-level phylogeny, of the moa branch (Dinornithiformes) of the &quot;ancient jawed&quot; birds (Palaeognathae) shown above:
==Distribution and habitat==
Analyses of fossil moa bone assemblages have provided detailed data on the habitat preferences of individual moa species, and revealed distinctive regional moa faunas:

===South Island===

The two main faunas identified in the South Island include:
: The fauna of the high-rainfall west coast beech (&quot;Nothofagus&quot;) forests that included &quot;Anomalopteryx didiformis&quot; (bush moa) and &quot;Dinornis robustus&quot; (South Island giant moa), and
: The fauna of the dry rainshadow forest and shrublands east of the Southern Alps that included &quot;Pachyornis elephantopus&quot; (heavy-footed moa), &quot;Euryapteryx gravis&quot;, &quot;Emeus crassus&quot;, and &quot;Dinornis robustus&quot;.
A &#x27;subalpine fauna&#x27; might include the widespread &quot;D. robustus&quot;, and the two other moa species that existed in the South Island:
:: &quot;Pachyornis australis&quot;, the rarest moa species, the only moa species not yet found in Māori middens. Its bones have been found in caves in the northwest Nelson and Karamea districts (such as Honeycomb Hill Cave), and some sites around the Wānaka district.
:: &quot;Megalapteryx didinus&quot;, more widespread, named &quot;upland moa&quot; because its bones are commonly found in the subalpine zone. However, it also occurred down to sea level, where suitable steep and rocky terrain (such as Punakaiki on the west coast and Central Otago) existed. Their distributions in coastal areas have been rather unclear, but were present at least in several locations such as on Kaikōura, Otago Peninsula, and Karitane.

===North Island===
Significantly less is known about North Island paleofaunas, due to the scarcity of fossil sites compared to the South Island, but the basic pattern of moa-habitat relationships was the same. The South Island and the North Island shared some moa species (&quot;Euryapteryx gravis&quot;, &quot;Anomalopteryx didiformis&quot;), but most were exclusive to one island, reflecting divergence over several thousand years since lower sea level in the Ice Age had made a land bridge across the Cook Strait.

In the North Island, &quot;Dinornis novaezealandiae&quot; and &quot;Anomalopteryx didiformis&quot; dominated in high-rainfall forest habitat, a similar pattern to the South Island. The other moa species present in the North Island (&quot;Euryapteryx gravis&quot;, &quot;E. curtus&quot;, and &quot;Pachyornis geranoides&quot;) tended to inhabit drier forest and shrubland habitats. &quot;P. geranoides&quot; occurred throughout the North Island. The distributions of &quot;E. gravis&quot; and &quot;E. curtus&quot; were almost mutually exclusive, the former having only been found in coastal sites around the southern half of the North Island.

==Behaviour and ecology==

About eight moa trackways, with fossilised moa footprint impressions in fluvial silts, have been found in the North Island, including Waikanae Creek (1872), Napier (1887), Manawatū River (1895), Marton (1896), Palmerston North (1911) (see photograph to left), Rangitīkei River (1939), and under water in Lake Taupō (1973). Analysis of the spacing of these tracks indicates walking speeds between .

===Diet===
Their diet has been deduced from fossilised contents of their gizzards and coprolites, as well as indirectly through morphological analysis of skull and beak, and stable isotope analysis of their bones. Moa fed on a range of plant species and plant parts, including fibrous twigs and leaves taken from low trees and shrubs. The beak of &quot;Pachyornis elephantopus&quot; was analogous to a pair of secateurs, and could clip the fibrous leaves of New Zealand flax (&quot;Phormium tenax&quot;) and twigs up to at least 8 mm in diameter.

Moa filled the ecological niche occupied in other countries by large browsing mammals such as antelope and llamas. Some biologists contend that a number of plant species evolved to avoid moa browsing. Divaricating plants such as &quot;Pennantia corymbosa&quot; (the kaikōmako), which have small leaves and a dense mesh of branches, and &quot;Pseudopanax crassifolius&quot; (the horoeka or lancewood), which has tough juvenile leaves, are possible examples of plants that evolved in such a way. Likewise, it has been suggested that heteroblasty might be a response to moa browsing.

Like many other birds, moa swallowed gizzard stones (gastroliths), which were retained in their muscular gizzards, providing a grinding action that allowed them to eat coarse plant material. This grinding action suggests that moa were not effective seed dispersers, with only the smallest seeds passing through their gut intact. These stones were commonly smooth rounded quartz pebbles, but stones over long have been found among preserved moa gizzard contents. &quot;Dinornis&quot; gizzards could often contain several kilograms of stones. Moa likely exercised a certain selectivity in the choice of gizzard stones and chose the hardest pebbles.

===Reproduction===

The pairs of species of moa described as &quot;Euryapteryx curtus&quot; / &quot;E. exilis&quot;, &quot;Emeus huttonii&quot; / &quot;E. crassus&quot;, and &quot;Pachyornis septentrionalis&quot; / &quot;P. mappini&quot; have long been suggested to constitute males and females, respectively. This has been confirmed by analysis for sex-specific genetic markers of DNA extracted from bone material.

For example, before 2003, three species of &quot;Dinornis&quot; were recognised: South Island giant moa (&quot;D. robustus&quot;), North Island giant moa (&quot;D. novaezealandiae&quot;), and slender moa (&quot;D. struthioides&quot;). However, DNA showed that all &quot;D. struthioides&quot; were males, and all &quot;D. robustus&quot; were females. Therefore, the three species of &quot;Dinornis&quot; were reclassified as two species, one each formerly occurring on New Zealand&#x27;s North Island (&quot;D. novaezealandiae&quot;) and South Island (&quot;D. robustus&quot;); &quot;D. robustus&quot; however, comprises three distinct genetic lineages and may eventually be classified as many species, as discussed above.

Examination of growth rings in moa cortical bone has revealed that these birds were K-selected, as are many other large endemic New Zealand birds. They are characterised by having a low fecundity and a long period, taking about 10 years to reach adult size. The large &quot;Dinornis&quot; species took as long to reach adult size as small moa species, and as a result, had fast skeletal growth during their juvenile years.

No evidence has been found to suggest that moa were colonial nesters. Moa nesting is often inferred from accumulations of eggshell fragments in caves and rock shelters, little evidence exists of the nests themselves. Excavations of rock shelters in the eastern North Island during the 1940s found moa nests, which were described as &quot;small depressions obviously scratched out in the soft dry pumice&quot;. Moa nesting material has also been recovered from rock shelters in the Central Otago region of the South Island, where the dry climate has preserved plant material used to build the nesting platform (including twigs clipped by moa bills). Seeds and pollen within moa coprolites found among the nesting material provide evidence that the nesting season was late spring to summer.

Fragments of moa eggshell are often found in archaeological sites and sand dunes around the New Zealand coast. Thirty-six whole moa eggs exist in museum collections and vary greatly in size (from in length and wide). The outer surface of moa eggshell is characterised by small, slit-shaped pores. The eggs of most moa species were white, although those of the upland moa (&quot;Megalapteryx didinus&quot;) were blue-green.

A 2010 study by Huynen et al. found that the eggs of certain species were fragile, only around a millimetre in shell thickness: &quot;Unexpectedly, several thin-shelled eggs were also shown to belong to the heaviest moa of the genera &quot;Dinornis&quot;, &quot;Euryapteryx&quot;, and &quot;Emeus&quot;, making these, to our knowledge, the most fragile of all avian eggs measured to date. Moreover, sex-specific DNA recovered from the outer surfaces of eggshells belonging to species of &quot;Dinornis&quot; and &quot;Euryapteryx&quot; suggest that these very thin eggs were likely to have been incubated by the lighter males. The thin nature of the eggshells of these larger species of moa, even if incubated by the male, suggests that egg breakage in these species would have been common if the typical contact method of avian egg incubation was used.&quot; Despite the bird&#x27;s extinction, the high yield of DNA available from recovered fossilised eggs has allowed the moa&#x27;s genome to be sequenced.

== Pre-human forests ==
Studies of accumulated dried vegetation in the pre-human mid-late Holocene period suggests a low &quot;Sophora microphylla&quot; or Kōwai forest ecosystem in Central Otago that was used and perhaps maintained by moa, for both nesting material and food. Neither the forests nor moa existed when European settlers came to the area in the 1850s.

== Relationship with humans ==

===Extinction===

Before the arrival of humans, the moa&#x27;s only predator was the massive Haast&#x27;s eagle. New Zealand had been isolated for 80 million years and had few predators before human arrival, meaning that not only were its ecosystems extremely vulnerable to perturbation by outside species, but also the native species were ill-equipped to cope with human predators. Polynesians arrived sometime before 1300, and all moa genera were soon driven to extinction by hunting and, to a lesser extent, by habitat reduction due to forest clearance. By 1445, all moa had become extinct, along with Haast&#x27;s eagle, which had relied on them for food. Recent research using carbon-14 dating of middens strongly suggests that the events leading to extinction took less than a hundred years, rather than a period of exploitation lasting several hundred years as previously hypothesised.

An expedition in the 1850s under Lieutenant A. Impey reported two emu-like birds on a hillside in the South Island; an 1861 story from the &quot;Nelson Examiner&quot; told of three-toed footprints measuring between Tākaka and Riwaka that were found by a surveying party; and finally in 1878, the &quot;Otago Witness&quot; published an additional account from a farmer and his shepherd. An 86-year-old woman, Alice McKenzie, claimed in 1959 that she had seen a moa in Fiordland bush in 1887, and again on a Fiordland beach when she was 17 years old. She claimed that her brother had also seen a moa on another occasion. In childhood, Mackenzie saw a large bird that she believed to be a takahē, but after its rediscovery in the 1940s, she saw a picture of it and concluded that she had seen something else.

Some authors have speculated that a few &quot;Megalapteryx didinus&quot; may have persisted in remote corners of New Zealand until the 18th and even 19th centuries, but this view is not widely accepted. Some Māori hunters claimed to be in pursuit of the moa as late as the 1770s; however, these accounts possibly did not refer to the hunting of actual birds as much as a now-lost ritual among South Islanders. Whalers and sealers recalled seeing monstrous birds along the coast of the South Island, and in the 1820s, a man named George Pauley made an unverified claim of seeing a moa in the Otago region of New Zealand. Occasional speculation since at least the late 19th century, and as recently as 2008, has suggested that some moa may still exist, particularly in the wilderness of South Westland and Fiordland. A 1993 report initially interested the Department of Conservation, but the animal in a blurry photograph was identified as a red deer. Cryptozoologists continue to search for them, but their claims and supporting evidence (such as of purported footprints) have earned little attention from experts and are pseudoscientific.

The rediscovery of the takahē in 1948 after none had been seen since 1898 showed that rare birds can exist undiscovered for a long time. However, the takahē is a much smaller bird than the moa, and was rediscovered after its tracks were identified—yet no reliable evidence of moa tracks has ever been found, and experts still contend that moa survival is extremely unlikely, since they would have to be living unnoticed for over 500 years in a region visited often by hunters and hikers.

===Surviving remains===

Joel Polack, a trader who lived on the East Coast of the North Island from 1834 to 1837, recorded in 1838 that he had been shown &quot;several large fossil ossifications&quot; found near Mt Hikurangi. He was certain that these were the bones of a species of emu or ostrich, noting that &quot;the Natives add that in times long past they received the traditions that very large birds had existed, but the scarcity of animal food, as well as the easy method of entrapping them, has caused their extermination&quot;. Polack further noted that he had received reports from Māori that a &quot;species of Struthio&quot; still existed in remote parts of the South Island.

Dieffenbach also refers to a fossil from the area near Mt Hikurangi, and surmises that it belongs to &quot;a bird, now extinct, called Moa (or Movie) by the natives&quot;. &#x27;Movie&#x27; is the first transcribed name for the bird. In 1839, John W. Harris, a Poverty Bay flax trader who was a natural-history enthusiast, was given a piece of unusual bone by a Māori who had found it in a river bank. He showed the fragment of bone to his uncle, John Rule, a Sydney surgeon, who sent it to Richard Owen, who at that time was working at the Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons in London.

Owen puzzled over the fragment for almost four years. He established it was part of the femur of a big animal, but it was uncharacteristically light and honeycombed. Owen announced to a skeptical scientific community and the world that it was from a giant extinct bird like an ostrich, and named it &quot;Dinornis&quot;. His deduction was ridiculed in some quarters, but was proved correct with the subsequent discoveries of considerable quantities of moa bones throughout the country, sufficient to reconstruct skeletons of the birds. In July 2004, the Natural History Museum in London placed on display the moa bone fragment Owen had first examined, to celebrate 200 years since his birth, and in memory of Owen as founder of the museum. Since the discovery of the first moa bones in the late 1830s, thousands more have been found. They occur in a range of late Quaternary and Holocene sedimentary deposits, but are most common in three main types of site: caves, dunes, and swamps.

Bones are commonly found in caves or &quot;tomo&quot; (the Māori word for doline or sinkhole, often used to refer to pitfalls or vertical cave shafts). The two main ways that the moa bones were deposited in such sites were birds that entered the cave to nest or escape bad weather, and subsequently died in the cave and birds that fell into a vertical shaft and were unable to escape. Moa bones (and the bones of other extinct birds) have been found in caves throughout New Zealand, especially in the limestone/marble areas of northwest Nelson, Karamea, Waitomo, and Te Anau.

Moa bones and eggshell fragments sometimes occur in active coastal sand dunes, where they may erode from paleosols and concentrate in &#x27;blowouts&#x27; between dune ridges. Many such moa bones antedate human settlement, although some originate from Māori midden sites, which frequently occur in dunes near harbours and river mouths (for example the large moa hunter sites at Shag River, Otago, and Wairau Bar, Marlborough).

Densely intermingled moa bones have been encountered in swamps throughout New Zealand. The most well-known example is at Pyramid Valley in north Canterbury, where bones from at least 183 individual moa have been excavated, mostly by Roger Duff of Canterbury Museum. Many explanations have been proposed to account for how these deposits formed, ranging from poisonous spring waters to floods and wildfires. However, the currently accepted explanation is that the bones accumulated slowly over thousands of years, from birds that entered the swamps to feed and became trapped in the soft sediment.

Many New Zealand and international museums hold moa bone collections. Auckland War Memorial Museum – Tāmaki Paenga Hira has a significant collection, and in 2018 several moa skeletons were imaged and 3D scanned to make the collections more accessible. There is also a major collection in Otago Museum in Dunedin.

===Feathers and soft tissues===
Several examples of moa remains have been found with soft tissues (muscle, skin, feathers) preserved through desiccation after the bird died at a dry site (for example, a cave with a constant dry breeze blowing through it). Most were found in the semiarid Central Otago region, the driest part of New Zealand, but others are known from outside the Central Otago region. These include:

* Dried muscle on bones of a female &quot;Dinornis robustus&quot; found at Tiger Hill in the Manuherikia River Valley by gold miners in 1864 (currently held by Yorkshire Museum)
* Several bones of &quot;Emeus crassus&quot; with muscle attached, and a row of neck vertebrae with muscle, skin, and feathers collected from Earnscleugh Cave near the town of Alexandra in 1870 (currently held by the Otago Museum)
*An articulated foot of a male &quot;D. giganteus&quot; with skin and foot pads preserved, found in a crevice on the Knobby Range in 1874 (currently held by the Otago Museum)
* The type specimen of &quot;Megalapteryx didinus&quot; found near Queenstown in 1878 (currently held by Natural History Museum, London; see photograph of foot on this page)
* The lower leg of &quot;Pachyornis elephantopus&quot;, with skin and muscle, from the Hector Range in 1884; (currently held by the Zoology Department, Cambridge University)
* The complete feathered leg of a &quot;M. didinus&quot; from Old Man Range in 1894 (currently held by the Otago Museum)
* The head of a &quot;M. didinus&quot; found near Cromwell sometime before 1949 (currently held by Te Papa Tongarewa).
* A complete foot of &quot;M. didinus&quot; found in a cave on Mount Owen near Nelson in the 1980s (currently held by Te Papa Tongarewa)
* A skeleton of &quot;Anomalopteryx didiformis&quot; with muscle, skin, and feather bases collected from a cave near Te Anau in 1980.
In addition to these specimens, loose moa feathers have been collected from caves and rock shelters in the southern South Island, and based on these remains, some idea of the moa plumage has been achieved. The preserved leg of &quot;M. didinus&quot; from the Old Man Range reveals that this species was feathered right down to the foot. This is likely to have been an adaptation to living in high-altitude, snowy environments, and is also seen in the Darwin’s rhea, which lives in a similar seasonally snowy habitat.

Moa feathers are up to long, and a range of colours has been reported, including reddish-brown, white, yellowish, and purplish. Dark feathers with white or creamy tips have also been found, and indicate that some moa species may have had plumage with a speckled appearance.

===Potential revival===
The creature has frequently been mentioned as a potential candidate for revival by cloning. Its iconic status, coupled with the facts that it only became extinct a few hundred years ago and that substantial quantities of moa remains exist, mean that it is often listed alongside such creatures as the dodo as leading candidates for de-extinction. Preliminary work involving the extraction of DNA has been undertaken by Japanese geneticist Ankoh Yasuyuki Shirota.

Interest in the moa&#x27;s potential for revival was further stirred in mid-2014 when New Zealand Member of Parliament Trevor Mallard suggested that bringing back some smaller species of moa within 50 years was a viable idea. The idea was ridiculed by many, but gained support from some natural history experts.

==In literature and culture==

Heinrich Harder portrayed moa being hunted by Māori in the classic German collecting cards about extinct and prehistoric animals, &quot;Tiere der Urwelt&quot;, in the early 1900s.

The moa was the most commonly used animal as a symbol of New Zealand before it was replaced by the kiwi in the early 20th century.

Allen Curnow&#x27;s poem, &quot;The Skeleton of the Great Moa in the Canterbury Museum, Christchurch&quot; was published in 1943.

<text>Edward Donald Slovik (February 18, 1920January 31, 1945) was a United States Army soldier during World War II and the only American soldier to be court-martialled and executed for desertion since the American Civil War. Although over 21,000 American soldiers were given varying sentences for desertion during World War II, including 49 death sentences, Slovik&#x27;s death sentence was the only one that was carried out.

During World War II, 1.7 million courts-martial were held, representing one third of all criminal cases tried in the United States during the same period. Most of the cases were minor, as were the sentences. Nevertheless, a clemency board, appointed by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson in the summer of 1945, reviewed all general courts-martial where the accused was still in confinement, and remitted or reduced the sentence in 85 percent of the 27,000 serious cases reviewed. The death penalty was rarely imposed, and usually only for cases involving rape or murder. Slovik was the only soldier executed who had been convicted of a &quot;purely military&quot; offense.

==Early life and education==
Slovik was born in Detroit, Michigan in 1920 to a Catholic, Polish-American family, the son of Anna Lutsky and Josef Slowikowski. As a minor, he was a troublemaker and had contact with the police frequently. Slovik was first arrested at age 12 when he and some friends broke into a foundry to steal brass. From 1932 to 1937, he was arrested several times for offenses which included petty theft, breaking and entering, and disturbing the peace. In October 1937, he was sent to prison, but was paroled in September 1938. After stealing and crashing a car with two friends while drunk, he was sent back to prison in January 1939.

==Career==
In April 1942, Slovik was paroled once more. He then obtained a job at Montella Plumbing and Heating in Dearborn, Michigan. While working there, he met the woman who became his wife, Antoinette Wisniewski. She was working as a bookkeeper for Montella Plumbing&#x27;s owner, James Montella. They married on November 7, 1942, and lived with her parents. Slovik&#x27;s criminal record classified him as morally unfit for duty in the U.S. military (4-F), but, shortly after the couple&#x27;s first wedding anniversary, Slovik was reclassified as fit for duty (1-A) and subsequently drafted by the Army on January 3, 1944, from Detroit, Michigan.

Slovik arrived at Camp Wolters, Texas for basic training on January 24, 1944, and was assigned to Company D of the 59th Infantry Training Battalion on January 31, 1944. On July 11, 1944, he was assigned to Ground Forces Replacement Depot No. 1 at Fort George G. Meade, Maryland. In August, he was dispatched to join the fighting in German-occupied France, and was assigned to the 3rd Replacement Depot. On August 24, he was one of 129 replacements assigned to the 28th Infantry Division. He stayed in the division rear area overnight, before being assigned along with fifteen other men to Company G, 109th Infantry Regiment on August 25, 1944.

===Desertion===
While en route to his assigned unit near Elbeuf, France, Slovik and Private John Tankey, a friend he met at Fort Meade, took cover during an artillery attack during the night and became separated from Company G. Company G moved on the next morning, inadvertently leaving Slovik and Tankey behind. Slovik and Tankey found a Canadian military police unit that had occupied the town and remained with it for the next six weeks. Tankey wrote to his and Slovik&#x27;s regiment to explain their absence before the Canadians made arrangements for them to return to duty with their unit on October 7, 1944.

The following day, October 8, Slovik informed his company commander, Captain Ralph Grotte, that he was &quot;too scared&quot; to serve in a front-line rifle company and asked to be reassigned to a unit in a rear area. He then told Grotte that he would run away if he were assigned to a rifle unit, and asked his captain if that would constitute desertion, resulting in a court-martial. Grotte confirmed that it would, refused Slovik&#x27;s request for reassignment, and sent him to a rifle platoon.

The next day, October 9, Slovik deserted from his unit. John Tankey caught up with him and attempted to persuade him to stay, but Slovik&#x27;s only comment was that his &quot;mind was made up&quot;. Slovik walked several miles to the rear and approached an enlisted cook at a military government detachment of the 112th Infantry Regiment, presenting him with a note which stated:

The cook took Slovik to a military policeman, then to his company commander, who read the note and urged Slovik to destroy it before he was taken into custody. Slovik refused. He was brought before Lieutenant Colonel Ross Henbest, who again offered him the opportunity to tear up the note, return to his unit, and face no further charges; Slovik again refused. Henbest instructed Slovik to write another note on the back of the first one stating that he fully understood the consequences of deliberately incriminating himself, and that it would be used as evidence against him in a court-martial.

Slovik was taken into custody and confined to the division stockade. The division&#x27;s judge advocate, Lieutenant Colonel Henry Sommer, offered Slovik a third and final opportunity to rejoin his unit in exchange for the charges against him being dropped. He also offered to transfer Slovik to a different infantry regiment in the division where no one would know of his past and he could start with a &quot;clean slate&quot;. Slovik, still convinced that he would face only jail time (which he had already experienced and considered far more tolerable than combat), declined these offers, saying &quot;I&#x27;ve made up my mind. I&#x27;ll take my court martial.&quot;

===Court-martial===
The 28th Infantry Division was scheduled to begin an attack in the Hurtgen Forest. The coming attack was common knowledge in the unit, and casualty rates were expected to be high, as the prolonged combat in the area had been unusually grueling. The Germans were determined to hold the terrain, and weather greatly reduced the usual American advantages in armor and air support. A small minority of soldiers (less than 0.5%) indicated they preferred to be imprisoned rather than remain in combat, and the rates of desertion and other crimes had begun to rise.

Slovik was charged with desertion to avoid hazardous duty and tried by court-martial on November 11, 1944. Slovik had to be tried by a court-martial composed of staff officers from other U.S. Army divisions, because all combat officers from the 28th Infantry Division were fighting on the front lines. The prosecutor, Captain John Green, presented witnesses to whom Slovik had stated his intention to &quot;run away&quot;. According to his defense counsel, Captain Edward Woods, Slovik had elected not to testify. At the end of the day, the nine officers of the court found Slovik guilty and sentenced him to death. The sentence was reviewed and approved by Major General Norman Cota, the division commander. General Cota&#x27;s stated attitude was &quot;Given the situation as I knew it in November 1944, I thought it was my duty to this country to approve that sentence. If I hadn&#x27;t approved it — if I had let Slovik accomplish his purpose — I don&#x27;t know how I could have gone up to the line and looked a good soldier in the face.&quot;

On December 9, Slovik wrote a letter to the Supreme Allied Commander, General Dwight D. Eisenhower, pleading for clemency. However, desertion had become a systemic problem in France, and the Battle of the Bulge, a surprise German offensive through the Ardennes, began on December 16 with severe US casualties, bypassing and surrounding many units and straining the morale of the infantry to the greatest extent yet seen during the war.

The case was reviewed by assistant staff judge advocate Maj. Frederick J. Bertolet, who recommended against granting clemency. Bertolet wrote: 
Brigadier General E. C. McNeil, the senior Army lawyer in the European Theater, and lawyers on McNeil’s staff, reviewed Slovik’s case. McNeil wrote:
Lt. Col. Henry J. Sommer, the division judge advocate who had previously offered Slovik a final opportunity to have his charges dismissed, wrote:
Eisenhower confirmed the execution order on December 23, noting that it was necessary to discourage further desertions. The sentence came as a shock to Slovik, who had been expecting a dishonorable discharge and a prison term, the same punishment he had seen given to other deserters from the division while he was confined to the stockade. As he was an ex-convict, a dishonorable discharge would have made little impact on his civilian life as a common laborer, and military prison terms for discipline offenses were widely expected to be commuted once the war was over.

==Execution==
The execution by firing squad was carried out at 10:04 a.m. on January 31, 1945, near the village of Sainte-Marie-aux-Mines. The defiant Slovik said to the soldiers whose duty it was to prepare him for the firing squad before they led him to the place of execution:

As required by military custom, Slovik&#x27;s uniform was stripped of all identifying military insignia, buttons, and any other accoutrements. He was wrapped with a GI blanket over his shoulders to protect him against the cold, and led into the courtyard of a house chosen for the execution because of its high masonry wall, which would deflect errant bullets and discourage the local French civilians from witnessing the proceedings. Soldiers stood him against a six inch by six inch (15 × 15 cm) post. He was then strapped to the post with web belts, with one wrapped around and under his arms and hung on a spike on the back side of the post to prevent his body from slumping following the volley, and the others securing his waist and knees. Just before a soldier placed a black hood over his head, the attending chaplain, Father Carl Patrick Cummings, said to Slovik, &quot;Eddie, when you get up there, say a little prayer for me.&quot; Slovik replied with his last words: &quot;Okay, Father. I&#x27;ll pray that you don&#x27;t follow me too soon.&quot;

The firing squad consisted of twelve soldiers selected from the 109th Regiment. The weapons used were standard-issue M1 Garand rifles, eleven of them loaded with just one round and one rifle loaded with a blank round. On the command of &quot;Fire&quot;, Slovik was hit by eleven bullets, at least four of them being fatal. The wounds ranged from high in the neck region out to the left shoulder, over the left chest, and under the heart. One bullet was in the left upper arm. An Army physician quickly determined Slovik had not been immediately killed. As the firing squad&#x27;s rifles were being reloaded to fire another volley, Slovik died. He was 24 years old. The entire execution took 15 minutes.

==Burial==
Slovik was buried in Plot E of Oise-Aisne American Cemetery and Memorial in Fère-en-Tardenois, alongside 95 American soldiers executed for rape or murder. Their grave markers are hidden from view by shrubbery and bear sequential numbers instead of names, making it impossible to identify them individually without knowing the key. Antoinette Slovik petitioned the Army for her husband&#x27;s remains and his pension until her death in 1979.

Slovik&#x27;s case was taken in 1981 by former Macomb County Commissioner Bernard V. Calka, a Polish-American and veteran of World War II, who continued to petition the Army to return Slovik&#x27;s remains to the United States. In 1987, he persuaded President Ronald Reagan to order their return. In 1987, Calka raised $5,000 to pay for the exhumation of Slovik&#x27;s remains from Row 3, Grave 65 of Plot E, and their transfer to Detroit&#x27;s Woodmere Cemetery, where Slovik was reburied next to his wife. Slovik&#x27;s military service record is now a public archival record available from the Military Personnel Records Center.

Antoinette Slovik and others petitioned seven U.S. presidents (Harry S. Truman, Dwight D. Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, and Jimmy Carter) for a pardon, but none was granted.

==Analysis==
In militaries around the world, courts-martial have imposed death sentences for offenses such as cowardice, desertion, insubordination, and mutiny. In France during World War I, from 1917 to 1918, the United States Army executed 35 of its own soldiers, but all were convicted of rape or unprovoked murder of civilians and not for military offenses. During World War II, in all theaters of the war, the United States military executed 102 of its own soldiers for rape or unprovoked murder of civilians, but only Slovik was executed for the military offense of desertion.

Colonel Robert C. Bard of the judge advocate general&#x27;s office noted that of the 2,864 army personnel tried for desertion for the period January 1942 through June 1948, 49 were convicted and sentenced to death, with 48 of those sentences commuted by higher authority. At least one of the members of the tribunal came to believe that Slovik&#x27;s execution was an injustice in light of all the circumstances, and was an example of disparate treatment from a flawed process.

==In popular culture==
In 1954, William Bradford Huie published a non-fiction account of the case titled &quot;The Execution of Private Slovik&quot;.

In 1960, Frank Sinatra announced his plan to produce a movie based on the book, with the same title, to be written by screenwriter Albert Maltz. This announcement provoked great outrage, in part because Maltz was part of the blacklisted Hollywood 10, and Sinatra was accused of being a Communist sympathizer. As Sinatra was campaigning for John F. Kennedy for president at the time, the Kennedy camp became concerned, and persuaded Sinatra to cancel the project.

Hans Magnus Enzensberger wrote an essay about Slovik and his death, included in the 1964 book &quot;Dreamers of the Absolute&quot; ().

In 1968, psychedelic folk rock group Pearls Before Swine dedicated their second album &quot;Balaklava&quot; &quot;to Pvt. Edward D. Slovik, U.S. Army, deceased&quot;.

In 1974, Huie&#x27;s book was adapted by Lamont Johnson into a TV movie, also titled &quot;The Execution of Private Slovik&quot;, which starred Martin Sheen.

The 1963 war film &quot;The Victors&quot; includes a scene featuring the execution of a deserter that closely resembles Slovik&#x27;s desertion and execution.

Kurt Vonnegut mentions Slovik&#x27;s execution in his 1969 novel &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot;. Vonnegut also wrote a companion (alternate) libretto to Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Histoire du soldat&quot; (&quot;A Soldier&#x27;s Tale&quot;), telling Slovik&#x27;s story.

<text>The Preakness Stakes is an American thoroughbred horse race held annually on Armed Forces Day, the third Saturday in May at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland. The Preakness Stakes is a Grade I race run over a distance of on dirt. Colts and geldings carry ; fillies . It is the second jewel (or leg) of the Triple Crown, held two weeks after the Kentucky Derby and three weeks before the Belmont Stakes.

First run in 1873, the Preakness Stakes was named by a former Maryland governor after the colt who won the first Dinner Party Stakes at Pimlico. Annual &quot;Preakness Weekend&quot; races include both the Saturday Preakness Stakes and a Grade II race on Friday for fillies only named the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes. Attendance at the Preakness Stakes ranks second in North America among equestrian events, surpassed only by the Kentucky Derby.

The 149th running of the Preakness Stakes was held on Saturday, May 18, 2024.

==History==
Two years before the Kentucky Derby was run for the first time, Pimlico introduced its new stakes race for three-year-olds, the Preakness, during its first spring race meet in 1873. Then Maryland governor Oden Bowie named the then mile and one-half (2.41 km) race in honor of the colt Preakness from Milton Holbrook Sanford&#x27;s Preakness Stud in Preakness, Wayne Township, New Jersey, who won the Dinner Party Stakes on the day Pimlico opened (October 25, 1870). The New Jersey name was said to have come from the Native American name &quot;Pra-qua-les&quot; (&quot;Quail Woods&quot;) for the area. After Preakness won the Dinner Party Stakes, his jockey, Billy Hayward, untied a silk bag of gold coins that hung from a wire stretched across the track from the judges&#x27; stand. This was the supposed way that the &quot;wire&quot; at the finish line was introduced and how the awarding of &quot;purse&quot; money came to be. In reality, the term &quot;purse&quot;, meaning prize money, had been in use for well over a century.
The first Preakness, held on May 27, 1873, drew seven starters. John Chamberlain&#x27;s three-year-old, Survivor, collected the $2,050 winning purse by galloping home easily by 10 lengths. This was the largest margin of victory until 2004, when Smarty Jones won by 11 1/2 lengths.

In 1890, Morris Park Racecourse in The Bronx, New York, hosted the Preakness Stakes. This race was run under handicap conditions, and the age restriction was lifted. The race was won by a five-year-old horse named Montague. After 1890, there was no race run for three years. For the 15 years from 1894 through 1908, the race was held at Gravesend Race Track on Coney Island, New York. In 1909 it returned to Pimlico.

Seven editions of the Preakness Stakes have been run under handicap conditions, in which more accomplished or favored horses are assigned to carry heavier weight. It was first run under these conditions in 1890 and again in the years 1910–1915. During these years, the race was known as the Preakness Handicap.

In March 2009 Magna Entertainment Corp., which owns Pimlico, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy thus throwing open the possibility the Stakes could move again. On April 13, 2009, the Maryland Legislature approved a plan to buy the Stakes and the Pimlico course if Magna Entertainment could not find a buyer.

Attendance at the Preakness Stakes ranks second in North America and usually surpasses the attendance of all other stakes races including the Belmont Stakes, the Breeders&#x27; Cup and the Kentucky Oaks. The attendance of the Preakness Stakes typically only trails the Kentucky Derby, for more information see American thoroughbred racing top attended events.

In February 2017, the Maryland Stadium Authority released the first phase of a study saying that Pimlico needed $250 million in renovations. As of May of that year, no one showed interest in financing the work. The Stronach Group, owner of Pimlico Race Course and Laurel Park, was only interested in moving the Preakness Stakes to Laurel Park unless someone else financed work on Pimlico.

In October 2019, The Stronach Group reached an agreement in principle with the city of Baltimore and groups representing Maryland horsemen that would permanently keep the Preakness at Pimlico. As part of the agreement, Pimlico&#x27;s grandstand would be demolished and replaced with a smaller structure, and temporary seating would be added to handle the attendance during Preakness week. 
The Racing and Community Development Act, approved by the Maryland state legislature in May 2020, allows the Maryland Stadium Authority to issue $375 million in bonds for the renovation of both Stronach Group tracks.

The 145th running of the Preakness Stakes was held on Saturday, October 3, 2020, a delay resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak earlier in the year, and setting the year&#x27;s contest four weeks after the also-delayed Kentucky Derby. It was held without spectators for health reasons because of the outbreak.

In April 2024 the Maryland General Assembly approved a bill that would consolidate Maryland thoroughbred racing at Pimlico and provide for the reconstruction of the Pimlico facility. As a result of the expected demolition and reconstruction of the Pimlico grandstand, the Preakness Stakes is expected to be moved to Laurel Park in 2026 before returning to Pimlico in 2027. 

In January 2025 management of thoroughbred racing in Maryland changed from the Stronach Group to the newly-formed, state-owned Maryland Thoroughbred Racetrack Operating Authority (MTROA). The Stronach Group retained intellectual ownership of the Preakness, for which the MTROA pays an annual licensing fee.

==Evolution of the Triple Crown series==
The Preakness is the second leg in American thoroughbred racing&#x27;s Triple Crown series and almost always attracts the Kentucky Derby winner, some of the other horses that ran in the Derby, and often a few horses that did not start in the Derby. The Preakness is miles, or furlongs (1.88 km), compared to the Kentucky Derby, which is miles / 10 furlongs (2 km). It is followed by the third leg, the Belmont Stakes, which is miles / 12 furlongs (2.4 km).

Since 1932, the order of Triple Crown races has the Kentucky Derby first, followed by the Preakness Stakes and then the Belmont Stakes. Prior to 1932, the Preakness was run before the Derby eleven times. On May 12, 1917, and again on May 13, 1922, the Preakness and the Derby were run on the same day.

To date, the Preakness is run on the third Saturday in May, two weeks after the Kentucky Derby, and three weeks before the Belmont Stakes. Consequently, the race is run no earlier than May 15, and no later than May 21. One exception is 2020, as that race was run in early October due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Traditions==
Traditionally, just after the horses for the Preakness were called to the post, the audience was invited to sing the third verse of &quot;Maryland, My Maryland&quot;, the official state song of Maryland. For many years, the Baltimore Colts&#x27; Marching Band would lead the song from the infield; in later years, it was sung by the United States Naval Academy Glee Club. Use of the song was discontinued as of the 2020 edition of the race—the song &quot;which celebrates the Confederacy, is considered by some to be racist.”

As soon as the Preakness winner has been declared official, a painter climbs a ladder to the top of a replica of the Old Clubhouse cupola. The colors of the victorious owner&#x27;s silks are applied on the jockey and horse that are part of the weather vane atop the infield structure. The practice began in 1909 when a horse and rider weather vane sat atop the old Members&#x27; Clubhouse, which was constructed when Pimlico opened in 1870. The Victorian building was destroyed by fire in June 1966. A replica of the old building&#x27;s cupola was built to stand in the Preakness winner&#x27;s circle in the infield.

A blanket of yellow flowers daubed with black lacquer to recreate the appearance of a black-eyed Susan is placed around the winning horse&#x27;s neck at this time, and a replica of the Woodlawn Vase is given to the winning horse&#x27;s owner. Should that horse have also won the Kentucky Derby, speculation and excitement immediately begin to mount as to whether that horse will go on to win the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing at the Belmont Stakes in June.

==Winning the race==
In 1917, the first Woodlawn Vase was awarded to the Preakness winner, who was not allowed to keep it. Eventually, a half-size reproduction of the trophy was given to winners to keep permanently. The original trophy is kept at the Baltimore Museum of Art and brought to the race each year under guard, for the winner&#x27;s presentation ceremony.

In 1940, it was proposed to drape the winning horse in a garland of the Maryland State flower, &quot;Rudbeckia hirta&quot;, commonly called black-eyed Susans. This posed a problem, as the race is run nearly two months before the flowers come into bloom in late June or July. At first, yellow Viking daisies were painted to resemble black-eyed Susans. Painted flowers have been discontinued since the first decade of the current millennium and Viking Poms, a member of the chrysanthemum family, are now used. Although the Preakness is sometimes referred to as &quot;the race for the black-eyed Susans&quot;, no black-eyed Susan is ever used.

In 1918, 26 horses entered the race, and it was run in two divisions, providing for two winners that year. Currently, the race is limited to 14 horses.

In 1948, the Preakness was televised for the first time by CBS.

The Preakness has been run at seven different distances:
* miles (2.41 km) : 1873–1888, 1890
* miles (2.01 km) : 1889
* miles (1.71 km) : 1894–1900, 1908
*1 mile 70 yards (1.67 km) : 1901–1907
*1 mile (1.61 km) : 1909, 1910
* miles (1.81 km) : 1911–1924
* miles (1.91 km) : 1925–present

==Purse money==
At its inauguration in 1873, the Preakness carried a value of $1,000. The first major increase occurred in 1919 when the race had a $25,000 value. It climbed to $100,000 in 1946 and in 1959 was raised to $150,000. Subsequent increases occurred from 1979 to 1989, when the purse rose four times from $200,000 to $500,000, before going to $1 million in 1997. On December 12, 2013, the Maryland Jockey Club announced for the 2014 running of the Preakness, the purse would be increased from $1,000,000 to $1,500,000.

==InfieldFest==
The race has had something of a party atmosphere in the past, especially in the infield, which is general admission. The course had a &quot;bring your own booze&quot; policy until 2009, formerly including kegs of beer but in the 2000s restricted to all the beer cans a person could carry in a cooler. However, despite crowds in excess of 100,000, the BYOB policy was canceled in 2009 after videos of intoxicated people running along the tops of lines of portable toilets while being pelted by beer cans reached a large audience.

In 2009, with the alcohol ban, race attendance dropped to 77,850 after topping 100,000 for eight consecutive years. In 2010, and the Maryland Jockey Club responded with a new event called &quot;InfieldFest&quot; with performances by musical acts, the &quot;Mug Club&quot;, which included an infield ticket and an unlimited-refill beer mug, and a mascot named &quot;Kegasus&quot;, a play on keg and pegasus (though actually a centaur). The much-derided Kegasus was retired in 2013. In 2010, ticket sales had recovered to 95,760 and have since stayed high.

Aside from InfieldFest, the race is known for its fancy hats and official cocktail, the Black-eyed Susan, made with vodka, St-Germain liqueur and pineapple, lime and orange juices.

==Records==
Speed record: 
* miles (1.91km) – 1:53 – Secretariat (1973)

Secretariat, the 1973 winner (and ultimately Triple Crown winner) was originally credited with a running time of 1:55. Two &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot; clockers, however, had timed Secretariat&#x27;s Preakness in 1:53 , which would be a new stakes record. A hearing was held over the time discrepancy, where a video replay showed Secretariat reached the wire faster than Canonero II, the then-current record holder, but instead of giving Secretariat the record, the Maryland Jockey Club decided to split the difference and make its official time that of Pimlico&#x27;s clocker, who had timed the race in 1:54 . The matter was finally resolved in June 2012, when a meeting of the Maryland Racing Commission unanimously ruled to change Secretariat&#x27;s final time to 1:53 based on testimony and analysis of the race replays. Consequently, Secretariat holds the current official record for all three Triple Crown races.

==Sire lines==

* the Darley Arabian (1700c) sire line (all branched through the Eclipse (1764) line) produced 130 Stakes winners (121 colts, 3 geldings, 6 fillies), including all winners from 1938 to present. The main branches of this sire line are:
** the King Fergus (1775) branch (all branched through the Voltigeur (1847) line), produced 13 winners. His sire line continued primarily through his son Vedette (1854) with 12 winners, due primarily to his son Galopin (1872) with 9 winners (exclusively through St. Simon (1881), most recently Pleasant Colony in 1981).
** the Potoooooooo (1773) branch produced 116 winners (all branched through the Waxy (1790) line), including all winners from 1982 to present. The primary branch of this sire line is through Whalebone (1807), which has produced 115 winners. In turn, the primary branch continues through Sir Hercules (1826), which has produced 97 winners (including all winners since 1984), and then the Birdcatcher (1833) branch which produced 91 winners. From Birdcatcher, the branch of The Baron (1842) has produced 85 winners (exclusively through the Stockwell (1849) line). Birdcatcher&#x27;s grandson Doncaster (1870) sired Bend Or (1877), whose sire line accounts for 77 winners. The main branch of the Bend Or sire line continued through his son Bona Vista (1889) with 63 winners, nearly exclusively through the Phalaris (1913) line with 62 winners, which has dominated in the last several decades (including all winners from 1984 to present) through the following sons: 
***the Fairway (1925) branch (1 winner, most recently Bally Ache in 1960);
***the Pharamond (1925) branch (5 winners, most recently Silver Charm in 1997); 
***the Sickle (1924) branch, which has produced all winners from 2021 to present (27 winners exclusively through Polynesian (1942) with his win in the 1945 Preakness Stakes, continued exclusively through his son Native Dancer (1950) with his win in the 1953 Preakness Stakes, continued primarily through his son Raise a Native (1961) with 23 winners, down through Mr Prospector (1970) with 20 winners (including all winners from 2021 to present) through 9 different sons: Tank’s Prospect, with his win in the 1985 Preakness Stakes, and 8 other sons through their progeny, with his son Fappiano (1977) accounting for 6 winners, (most recently Seize the Grey in 2024)); 
***the Pharos (1920) branch (29 winners all branched through the Nearco (1935) line, through his sons Royal Charger (1942), Nearctic (1954), and Nasrullah (1940)). The Royal Charger branch produced 5 winners (most recently Swiss Skydiver in 2020), the Nasrullah branch produced 11 winners primarily due to his son Bold Ruler (1954) with 10 winners (most recently California Chrome in 2014), while the Nearctic branch produced 13 winners, exclusively through his son Northern Dancer (1961) with his win in the 1964 Preakness Stakes, and direct male progeny of 12 winners, most recently War of Will in 2019, with his son Storm Bird (1978) accounting for 5 winners (most recently Justify in 2018).
*** special notes:

Since then, each winner of the Preakness Stakes has gone through Whalebone&#x27;s more frequent sire line branch of Sir Herecules (1826). The Newminster branch is the more common of the two branches derived through Camel with 8 winners. Newminster&#x27;s brother Orlando (1841) produced 6 winners (exclusively through the Commando (1898) line with 6 winners), most recently Carry Back in 1961.

<text>Alquerque (also known as al-qirkat from ) is a strategy board game that is thought to have originated in the Middle East. It is considered to be the parent of draughts (US: checkers) and Fanorona and the diagonals of its grid are the predecessor of the checkering of the draughts board.

==History==
The game first appears in literature late in the 10th century when Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahani mentioned qirkat in his 24-volume work &quot;Kitab al-Aghani&quot; (&quot;Book of Songs&quot;). This work, however, made no direct mention of the rules of the game, most likely because it is poetry and they would have been common knowledge in the context the book originated in. 

In &quot;Board and Table Games from Many Civilizations&quot;, R. C. Bell writes that &quot;when the Moors invaded Spain they took El-quirkat with them&quot;. Rules are included in &quot;Libro de los juegos&quot; (&quot;Book of games&quot;) commissioned by Alfonso X of Castile in the 13th century.

Spanish settlers in New Mexico introduced a four-player variant of alquerque to the Zuni.
==Rules==

Before starting, each player places their twelve pieces in the two rows closest to them and in the two rightmost spaces in the center row. The game is played in turns, with one player taking white and the other black.

* A piece can move from its point to any empty adjacent point that is connected by a line.
* A piece can jump over an opposing piece and remove it from the game, if that opposing piece is adjacent and the point beyond it is empty.
* Multiple capturing jumps are permitted, and indeed compulsory if possible.
* If a capture is possible it must be made, or else the piece is removed (or huffed).

The goal of the game is to eliminate the opponent&#x27;s pieces.

===Additional rules===
R. C. Bell developed additional rules, saying those given by Alfonso X, in his opinion, &quot;are not sufficient to play a game&quot;.
These extra rules are:
* A piece cannot move backward (e.g., a piece in the middle of an empty board would have five available moves).
* No piece can return to a point it has previously occupied.
* Once a piece has reached the opponent&#x27;s back row it can only move to capture opposing pieces.
* The game is won when either:
** The opponent has lost all of their pieces.
** None of the opponent&#x27;s pieces are able to move.

Bell also includes a scoring system for rating games.

<text>A permissive action link (PAL) is an access control security device for nuclear weapons. Its purpose is to prevent unauthorized arming or detonation of a nuclear weapon.
The United States Department of Defense definition is:

The earliest PALs were little more than locks introduced into the control and firing systems of a nuclear weapon, designed to prevent a person from detonating it or removing its safety features. More recent innovations have included encrypting the firing parameters it is programmed with, which must be decrypted to properly detonate the warhead, and anti-tamper systems which intentionally mis-detonate the weapon if its other security features are defeated, destroying it without giving rise to a nuclear explosion.

== History ==

=== Background ===
Permissive action links were developed in the United States in a gradual process from the first use of atomic weapons to the early 1960s. In 1953 the United States Atomic Energy Commission and the Department of Defense signed the &quot;Missiles and Rockets Agreement&quot;, which paved the way for the development and implementation of PALs. Certain national laboratories, under the auspices of the AEC, would develop and produce nuclear weapons, while the responsibility for the use and deployment remained with the military. The laboratories were also free to conduct their own research in the field of arms control and security. The thinking behind this was that if the government would ever be interested in such a security device, the research and development of prototypes would already be well advanced. At the beginning of the 1960s, the desire for the usage of such a system grew for both political and technological reasons.

Newer nuclear weapons were less complex in operation, relatively mass-produced (and therefore predictably similar), and less cumbersome to arm and use than previous designs. Accordingly, new methods were necessary to prevent their unauthorized use. As the Cold War came to a head in the 1960s, the government felt it best not to leave the use of nuclear weapons in the hands of possibly-renegade generals, including the commander of Strategic Air Command (SAC). Without Permissive Action Links, each nuclear weapon was effectively under the independent control of one person, the general under whose command it happened to fall.

In order to protect its NATO allies, the United States had stationed various nuclear weapons overseas; these weapons were thus at least under the partial control of the hosting allied state. This was especially concerning to the United States Congress, as control of these weapons by a third party was in violation of U.S. federal law. Added to this was the fact that some of the allies were considered potentially unstable—particularly West Germany and Turkey. There was considerable concern that in one of these countries the instructions of the civilian leadership of the host country could overrule that country&#x27;s military. In addition, the U.S. realized that in the event of war, parts of West Germany would be overwhelmed early on, and nuclear weapons stationed there could fall into the hands of the Soviet Union.

For a long time the U.S. military resisted the use of PALs. It feared the loss of its own independence, and it feared malfunction, which could put warheads out of action in a time of crisis. But the advantages of PALs outweighed the disadvantages: thanks to the PALs weapons were able to be distributed to a greater extent in Europe, so as to prevent a rapid and selective destruction or conquest by the Soviet bloc, while still retaining U.S. control over the farther-flung weapons.

=== Development and dissemination ===
The precursors of permissive action links were simple mechanical combination locks that were set into the control systems of nuclear weapons, such as the Minuteman ICBM. There they could perform different functions: some blocked the cavity through which the nuclear materials were shot to create a reaction; other locks blocked circuits; and some simply prevented access to the control panel. For testing, some of these mechanisms were installed during 1959 in weapons stationed in Europe.

The work on PAL prototypes remained at low levels until 1960. Sandia National Laboratories successfully created a number of new combination locks that were adaptable to different types of weapons. In the spring of 1961, there was a series of hearings in Congress, where Sandia presented the prototype of a special electro-mechanical lock, which was then known still as a &quot;proscribed action link&quot;. The military leadership, however, soon realized that this term had negative connotations for the use of weapons by the officer corps (&quot;proscribed&quot; meaning &quot;prohibited&quot;), and decided to start calling PAL &quot;permissive action link&quot; instead (&quot;permissive&quot; meaning &quot;allowing&quot; or &quot;tolerating&quot;).

In June 1962, President John F. Kennedy signed the National Security Action Memorandum number 160. This presidential directive ordered the installation of PALs in all U.S. nuclear weapons in Europe. (U.S. nuclear weapons that were not in Europe were excluded from the order.) The conversion was completed in September 1962 and cost $23 million ($ in dollars).

According to nuclear safety expert Bruce G. Blair, the US Air Force&#x27;s Strategic Air Command worried that in times of need the codes for the Minuteman ICBM force would not be available, so it decided to set the codes to 00000000 in all missile launch control centers. Blair said the missile launch checklists included an item confirming this combination until 1977. A 2014 article in &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; said that the US Air Force told the United States House Committee on Armed Services that &quot;A code consisting of eight zeroes has never been used to enable a MM ICBM, as claimed by Dr. Bruce Blair.&quot; The Air Force&#x27;s statement (that 00000000 was never &quot;used&quot; to enable an ICBM, i.e. the weapons were not actually launched) does not contradict Blair&#x27;s statement (that 00000000 was the code for doing so).

The complete conversion to PAL systems was relatively slow. In 1974, U.S. Defense Secretary James Schlesinger found that a variety of tactical nuclear weapons were still not fitted with permissive action links, even though the technology had been available for some time. It took another two years until all the tactical nuclear weapons were fully equipped with PALs. In 1981, almost 20 years after the invention of PALs, just over half of U.S. nuclear weapons were still equipped only with mechanical locks. It took until 1987 until these were completely replaced.

=== Modernization and the present ===
Over the years the permissive action links have been continuously maintained and upgraded. In 2002, PALs on older B61 nuclear bombs were replaced and upgraded with new systems to improve reliability and security, as a part of extending the weapons&#x27; service lives to at least 2025.

Code management system

The year 1995 saw the development of the code management system (CMS). The CMS has simplified the control and logistics for staff and improved the flexibility and speed in deploying and arming weapons. New codes can be used to recode, lock, and manage the weapons, while the secrecy and validity of the possible launch orders is still ensured. In total, CMS consists of fourteen custom products (nine software and five hardware products). The software products were developed by Sandia National Laboratories while the hardware was created by the National Nuclear Security Administration.

The CMS was fully operational for the first time in November 2001. A part of the system, a special cryptographic processor fitted into the weapons in 1997 had a potential Year 2000 problem. By the spring of 2004, all PAL systems were equipped with the CMS. It is thus currently the general foundation for future hardware and software improvements to PALs.

== Features ==
Elements of PAL systems are located deep within the nuclear device. The design and construction attempt to create a black box system so as to limit information leakage. PALs are also linked directly or indirectly with a number of other security measures, which together form a comprehensive security package. To prevent exploitation and sniffing via power line attacks permissive action links are powered by low-maintenance radioisotope generators. Instead of conventional batteries, these generators produce electricity using the heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium-238. Although the half-life of 238Pu is 87.7 years, these generators&#x27; lifespan is shorter than that; the alpha decay of the plutonium produces helium, causing the pressure inside the generator to increase.

PAL devices have been installed on all nuclear devices in the US arsenal. The US Navy was last to receive them, with all weapons fitted with PALs by 1996 or 1997.

=== Two-man rule ===


Modern PALs use the two-man rule, which is designed to prevent accidental or malicious launch of nuclear weapons by a single individual.

For example, on a ballistic missile submarine (SSBN), both the commanding officer (CO) and executive officer (XO) must agree that the order to launch is valid, and then mutually authorize the launch with their operations personnel. Instead of another party confirming a missile launch as in the case of land-based ICBMs, the set of keys is distributed among the key personnel on the submarine and kept in safes (each of these crew members has access only to his keys), some of which are locked by combination locks. Nobody onboard has the combination to open these safes; the unlock key comes as a part of the launch order from the higher authority.

In the case of Minuteman missile launch crews, both operators must agree that the launch order is valid by comparing the order&#x27;s authorization code against a code from a &quot;sealed authenticator&quot; (a special sealed envelope that holds a code). The sealed authenticators are stored in a safe that has two separate locks so that a single crew member cannot open the safe alone. Both crew members must simultaneously turn the four launch keys. An additional safeguard is provided by requiring the crew in another launch control center to do the same for the missiles to be launched.

=== Stronglinks and weaklinks ===

Another part of the PAL design is the inclusion of &quot;stronglinks&quot; and &quot;weaklinks&quot;. These ensure resilience to accidental activation through damage. The stronglinks include an increased ruggedness of some components and the inclusion of insensitive munitions so that they will not be circumvented by fire, vibration, or magnetic fields, leaving the PAL vulnerable to bypass after such damage. Also, activation-critical electronics within the weapon, such as capacitors, are selected so that they will fail before the safety device in the event of damage, ensuring that the weapon fails safe.

=== Critical signal detection ===
Nuclear weapons will only respond to a specific arming signal. This is passed to the weapon by a unique signal generator located outside the weapon. This output is specific and well-defined, precluding approximation, emulation, noise, or interference from being accepted as a false positive.

=== Environmental sensing device ===
An environmental sensing device (ESD) determines through environmental sensors whether the weapon is operating in its combat environment. For example, on an ICBM, a nuclear warhead would first be exposed to a strong acceleration, then a period of free fall and then further acceleration as the warhead reenters the atmosphere. The ESD determines the external parameters such as acceleration curve, temperature and pressure, and only arms the weapon when these environments are sensed in the correct order.

ESDs are not exclusive to weapons equipped with PALs and some weapons, such as the W25, also had ESDs despite not being fitted with PALs.

=== Limited retry and non-violent disablement ===
Modern PALs are believed to feature a limited number of code reentries before the weapon locks out, requiring that the weapon be returned to Pantex for rebuilding. This system may also include a non-violent disablement system, where some of the weapon&#x27;s internal components are destroyed to hamper use. This system may be part of the ordinary limited retry lockout system, or may be a feature that can be enabled if the local situation calls for it. The non-violent disablement system may also be part of the weapon&#x27;s anti-intrusion system, designed to activate if someone tries to enter one of the weapon&#x27;s exclusion regions such as for the purpose of circumventing the weapon&#x27;s PAL.

== Versions ==

Over the years the design and feature set of PALs has increased, as has the length of the access code. US-manufactured PALs are divided into five categories; however, the earliest PALs were never assigned a category letter.

== Usage by other states ==

The increase in the number of nuclear-armed states was a similar cause for concern for the United States government for reasons similar to the original impetus for PALs. Thus, since the 1960s, the US has offered its own PAL technologies to other nuclear powers. The US considered this a necessary step: if the technology were kept secret, it would only be half as effective as possible, since the other power in a conflict might not have such safety measures.

In the early 1970s, France was an early recipient of United States assistance on this critical element of nuclear security. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) went into effect in 1970 and precluded treaty members (including the US) from directly disseminating technology related to nuclear weapons development or enhancement. In order to get around this prohibition, the US developed a legal trick: &quot;negative guidance&quot;. French nuclear scientists would regularly brief US scientists on French developments in the field of PALs, and the US scientists would tell their French counterparts when they were not on the right track. In 1971, the US also offered its technology to the Soviet Union, which developed a similar system.

In the early 1990s, the People&#x27;s Republic of China requested information to develop its own PALs. The Clinton administration believed that to do so would give too much information to the Chinese about American weapon design, and therefore, refused the request.

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukraine had on its territory the world&#x27;s third largest nuclear weapons stockpile. While Ukraine had physical control of the weapons, it did not have operational control of the weapons as they were dependent on Russian-controlled electronic permissive action links and the Russian command-and-control system. In 1994, Ukraine agreed to the destruction of the weapons, and to join the NPT.

In 2007, the UK government revealed that its nuclear weapons were not equipped with permissive action links. Instead, the UK&#x27;s nuclear bombs to be dropped by aircraft were armed by inserting a key into a simple lock similar to those used to protect bicycles from theft. The UK withdrew all air-launched bombs in 1998.
Detailed information about PAL systems design and their use is classified, although these mechanisms have been offered to Pakistan for protection of their nuclear weapons. In the end, the US decided that it could not do so for legal reasons; the Pakistanis were also concerned that such technology would be sabotaged by a &quot;kill-switch&quot; that the US could operate. However, many experts in the field of nuclear technology in the US government supported the publication of the PAL system because they considered Pakistan&#x27;s arsenal as the world&#x27;s most vulnerable to abuse by terrorist groups.

In November 2007, &quot;The New York Times&quot; revealed that the US had invested $100 million since 2001 in a secret program to protect Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear arsenal. Instead of transferring PAL technology, the US provided helicopters, night vision and nuclear detection devices, as well as training to Pakistani personnel in order to prevent the theft or misuse of Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear material, warheads, and laboratories. According to the Pentagon officials and the U.S. military accounts, Pakistan believed to develop and code its own version of the PAL technology, and they believe to be Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear arsenals to be well secured.

<text>Irene van Dyk (née Viljoen; born 21 June 1972) is a South African-born New Zealand netball player. A goal-shooter, van Dyk is one of the world&#x27;s best-known netballers and is the most capped international player of all time.

Debuting in 1994, she represented South Africa 72 times and captained the team. In 2000, she moved to Wellington, New Zealand and was quickly picked for the New Zealand national team, the Silver Ferns. 

She was the 2003 New Zealand Sportswoman of the Year and a nominee in 2005.
She became a New Zealand citizen in 2005, and represented New Zealand for 14 years before retiring from international netball in June 2014.

Van Dyk played for the Central Pulse in the ANZ Championship from 2014, taking a coaching role in more recent years. For most of her domestic career in New Zealand she played for the Waikato/Bay of Plenty Magic (2003–2013).

==Personal life==
Irene van Dyk was born Irene Viljoen in Vereeniging, Gauteng, South Africa. In 1994 she married Christie van Dyk and the two have one child, a daughter named Bianca. Van Dyk is a teacher, having worked in both primary and intermediate schools. 

A 2002 biography of her by Russell Gray is called &quot;Changing Colours&quot;.

==South African career==
She made her debut for the South African national side in 1994 and went on to captain the side and represent them 72 times. She was part of the silver medal-winning South African team who beat New Zealand 59–57 in the first round of the 1995 Netball World Championships and lost 68–48 to Australia in the final.

==New Zealand career==

Van Dyk emigrated to New Zealand in 2000. 

===2002 Commonwealth Games===
Van Dyk won a silver medal as part of the New Zealand team that lost the final 57–55 against Australia at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England after double overtime.

===2003 Netball World Championships===
The Silver Ferns won the Netball World Championships in Kingston, Jamaica, beating Australia 49–47 in the final. Van Dyk netted 41 goals from 43 attempts at 95%. The Silver Ferns had not won a major event since the 1987 World Netball Championships in Glasgow, Scotland.

===2004===
On 5 July 2004 she came on at the start of the 3rd quarter of the third test match in a series against Australia and scored 24 from 24 shots to turn the match around.

In November 2004 she went to Australia where the Silver Ferns were defeated 2-1 by Australia.

===2005===
In the winter of 2005 a one-off Test was played in Sydney where the Silver Ferns beat Australia 50–43. Van Dyk was a dominant factor in the win and cemented her position as the world&#x27;s greatest goal shooter especially against Australia&#x27;s own formidable shooting weapon Catherine Cox whose own form fell away after being worn down by New Zealand&#x27;s goal keeper Vilimaina Davu.

From 2003 to 2013 van Dyk played national league netball for the Waikato Magic and in 2005 spearheaded their first National Bank Cup title. The win finished the Southern Sting&#x27;s six-year winning streak.

In October 2005 van Dyk helped defeat Australia 61–36. In a match notable for the loss of Australian Captain Liz Ellis for three-quarters of the match, New Zealand were too good for Australia with their speed, ball handling, uncompromising defence and shooting accuracy. Partnered with goal attack Jodi Te Huna, van Dyk&#x27;s composure and athleticism came to the fore and Australia appeared to have no response to this and the overall effort of New Zealand.

New Zealand had an undefeated year in 2005 including a successful end of year tour to the Caribbean where they beat Barbados and Jamaica.

===2006 Commonwealth Games===
New Zealand faced Australia, the defending champions, in the final of 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. Van Dyk performed with skill and determination in an enthralling battle against Australian goal keeper and home town girl Bianca Chatfield who gave a sterling performance against her. (Liz Ellis wasn&#x27;t available due to injury.) New Zealand won the final 60–55. Van Dyk shot a tournament high 300 goals from 324 shots for 93 percent during the games.

===2009===
On September the 23rd 2009, van Dyk played her 100th test for New Zealand, a 52–36 win over Australia. New Zealand lost the series 3–2.

===2010 Commonwealth Games===
In 2010, van Dyk was chosen to lead the New Zealand team in the Opening Ceremony of the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi.
The 2010 Games also saw her become the most capped player in Silver Ferns history, surpassing Lesley Rumball&#x27;s 110 caps.

Van Dyk shot 32 from 32 in the semi-final and 25 from 29 (86%) in the final when New Zealand beat Australia 66–64.

===2012===
In June van Dyk celebrated her 40th birthday and said she had no plans to retire.
In the ANZ Championship she shot a tournament high 501 goals from 527 shots at 95.1%. In the 2012 ANZ Championship season, she also led her team to the Grand Final, where the Magic beat the Vixens 41–38, to become the first ever New Zealand Franchise to win the ANZ Championship. Van Dyk netted 25/26 in that game.

===2014 - International retirement===
Van Dyk transferred to the Central Pulse following the resignation of coach Noeline Taurua from her previous team, Waikato/Bay of Plenty Magic. She averaged 27 goals per game, lower than previous seasons.

On 5 June 2014, Van Dyk announced her retirement from international netball, saying &quot;I have really high expectations of myself and my match statistics over the past few months in the ANZ Championship are simply not good enough to justify taking my game to the international level&quot;.

Her 20-year international career helped make her the most capped player of all time, with 217 caps (72 for South Africa and 145 for New Zealand). Her international career finished with 5917 goals from 6572 shots, a 90% shooting record. For the Silver Ferns she shot 4796 goals from 5288 attempts at 91%.

<text>Catalan&#x27;s conjecture (or Mihăilescu&#x27;s theorem) is a theorem in number theory that was conjectured by the mathematician Eugène Charles Catalan in 1844 and proven in 2002 by Preda Mihăilescu at Paderborn University. The integers 23 and 32 are two perfect powers (that is, powers of exponent higher than one) of natural numbers whose values (8 and 9, respectively) are consecutive. The theorem states that this is the &quot;only&quot; case of two consecutive perfect powers. That is to say, that 

==History==
The history of the problem dates back at least to Gersonides, who proved a special case of the conjecture in 1343 where (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) was restricted to be (2, 3) or (3, 2). The first significant progress after Catalan made his conjecture came in 1850 when Victor-Amédée Lebesgue dealt with the case &quot;b&quot; = 2.

In 1976, Robert Tijdeman applied Baker&#x27;s method in transcendence theory to establish a bound on &quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot; and used existing results bounding &quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot; in terms of &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot; to give an effective upper bound for &quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;. Michel Langevin computed a value of formula_1 for the bound, resolving Catalan&#x27;s conjecture for all but a finite number of cases.

Catalan&#x27;s conjecture was proven by Preda Mihăilescu in April 2002. The proof was published in the &quot;Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik&quot;, 2004. It makes extensive use of the theory of cyclotomic fields and Galois modules. An exposition of the proof was given by Yuri Bilu in the Séminaire Bourbaki. In 2005, Mihăilescu published a simplified proof.

==Pillai&#x27;s conjecture==

Pillai&#x27;s conjecture concerns a general difference of perfect powers : it is an open problem initially proposed by S. S. Pillai, who conjectured that the gaps in the sequence of perfect powers tend to infinity. This is equivalent to saying that each positive integer occurs only finitely many times as a difference of perfect powers: more generally, in 1931 Pillai conjectured that for fixed positive integers &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; the equation formula_2 has only finitely many solutions (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) with (&quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;) ≠ (2, 2). Pillai proved that for fixed &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and for any λ less than 1, we have formula_3 uniformly in &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;.

The general conjecture would follow from the ABC conjecture.

Pillai&#x27;s conjecture means that for every natural number &quot;n&quot;, there are only finitely many pairs of perfect powers with difference &quot;n&quot;. The list below shows, for &quot;n&quot; ≤ 64, all solutions for perfect powers less than 1018, such that the exponent of both powers is greater than 1. The number of such solutions for each &quot;n&quot; is listed at . See also for the smallest solution (&gt; 0).

<doc id="62385" wikidata="Q622408" url="?curid=62385" title="Beatnik">
<text>Beatniks were members of a social movement in the mid-20th century, who subscribed to an anti-materialistic lifestyle. They rejected the conformity and consumerism of mainstream American culture and expressed themselves through various forms of art, such as literature, poetry, music, and painting. They also experimented with spirituality, drugs, sexuality, and travel. The term &quot;beatnik&quot; was coined by &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; columnist Herb Caen in 1958, as a derogatory label for the followers of the Beat Generation, a group of influential writers and artists who emerged during the era of the Silent Generation&#x27;s maturing, from as early as 1946, to as late as 1963, but the subculture was at its most prevalent in the 1950s. This lifestyle of anti-consumerism may have been influenced by their generation living in extreme poverty in the Great Depression during their formative years, seeing slightly older people serve in WWII and being influenced by the rise of left-wing politics and the spread of Communism. The name was inspired by the Russian suffix &quot;-nik&quot;, which was used to denote members of various political or social groups. The term &quot;beat&quot; originally was used by Jack Kerouac in 1948 to describe his social circle of friends and fellow writers, such as Allen Ginsberg, William S. Burroughs, and Neal Cassady. Kerouac said that &quot;beat&quot; had multiple meanings, such as &quot;beaten down&quot;, &quot;beatific&quot;, &quot;beat up&quot;, and &quot;beat out&quot;. He also associated it with the musical term &quot;beat&quot;, which referred to the rhythmic patterns of jazz, a genre that influenced many beatniks.

Beatniks often were stereotyped as wearing black clothing, berets, sunglasses, and goatees, and speaking in hip slang that incorporated words like &quot;cool&quot;, &quot;dig&quot;, &quot;groovy&quot;, and &quot;square&quot;. They frequented coffeehouses, bookstores, bars, and clubs, where they listened to jazz, read poetry, discussed philosophy, and engaged in political activism. Some of the most famous beatnik venues were the Six Gallery in San Francisco, where Ginsberg first read his poem &quot;Howl&quot; in 1955; the Gaslight Cafe in New York City, where many poets performed; and the City Lights Bookstore, also in San Francisco, where Kerouac&#x27;s novel &quot;On the Road&quot; was published in 1957. Beatniks also traveled across the country and abroad, seeking new experiences and inspiration. Some of their destinations included Mexico, Morocco, India, Japan, and France.

Beatniks had a significant impact on American culture and society as they challenged the norms and values of their time. They influenced many aspects of art, literature, music, film, fashion, and language. They also inspired many social movements and subcultures that followed them, such as the hippies, the counterculture, the New Left, the environmental movement, and the LGBT movement. Some of the more notable figures who were influenced by or associated with beatniks include Bob Dylan, The Beatles, Andy Warhol, Ken Kesey, and Timothy Leary. Beatniks have been portrayed or parodied in many works of fiction, such as &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;, &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;, &quot;The Munsters&quot;, &quot;The Flintstones&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;.

==History==

In 1948, Jack Kerouac introduced the phrase &quot;Beat Generation&quot;, generalizing from his social circle to characterize the underground, anti-conformist youth gathering in New York City at that time. The name came up in conversation with John Clellon Holmes, who published an early Beat Generation novel titled &quot;Go&quot; (1952), along with the manifesto &quot;This Is the Beat Generation&quot; in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;. In 1954, Nolan Miller published his third novel &quot;Why I Am So Beat&quot; (Putnam), detailing the weekend parties of four students.

&quot;Beat&quot; came from underworld slang—the world of hustlers, drug addicts, and petty thieves—from which Allen Ginsberg and Kerouac sought inspiration. &quot;Beat&quot; was slang for &quot;beaten down&quot; or &quot;downtrodden&quot;. However, to Kerouac and Ginsberg, it also had a spiritual connotation, as in &quot;beatitude&quot;. Other adjectives discussed by Holmes and Kerouac were &quot;found&quot; and &quot;furtive&quot;. Kerouac felt he had identified (and was the embodiment of) a new trend analogous to the influential Lost Generation.

In &quot;Aftermath: The Philosophy of the Beat Generation&quot;, Kerouac criticized what he saw as a distortion of his visionary, spiritual ideas:

The Beat Generation, that was a vision that we had, John Clellon Holmes and I, and Allen Ginsberg in an even wilder way, in the late Forties, of a generation of crazy, illuminated hipsters suddenly rising and roaming America, serious, bumming and hitchhiking everywhere, ragged, beatific, beautiful in an ugly graceful new way—a vision gleaned from the way we had heard the word &quot;beat&quot; spoken on street corners on Times Square and in the Village, in other cities in the downtown city night of postwar America—beat, meaning down and out but full of intense conviction. We&#x27;d even heard old 1910 Daddy Hipsters of the streets speak the word that way, with a melancholy sneer. It never meant juvenile delinquents, it meant characters of a special spirituality who didn&#x27;t gang up but were solitary Bartlebies staring out the dead wall window of our civilization ...

Kerouac explained what he meant by &quot;beat&quot; at a Brandeis Forum, &quot;Is There A Beat Generation?&quot;, on November 8, 1958, at New York&#x27;s Hunter College Playhouse. The seminar&#x27;s panelists were Kerouac, James A. Wechsler, Princeton anthropologist Ashley Montagu and author Kingsley Amis. Wechsler, Montagu, and Amis wore suits, while Kerouac was clad in black jeans, ankle boots and a checkered shirt. Reading from a prepared text, Kerouac reflected on his beat beginnings:

It is because I am Beat, that is, I believe in beatitude and that God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten son to it ... Who knows, but that the universe is not one vast sea of compassion actually, the veritable holy honey, beneath all this show of personality and cruelty?

Kerouac&#x27;s statement was later published as &quot;The Origins of the Beat Generation&quot; (&quot;Playboy&quot;, June 1959). In that article, Kerouac noted how his original beatific philosophy had been ignored amid maneuvers by several pundits, among them San Francisco newspaper columnist Herb Caen, to alter Kerouac&#x27;s concept with jokes and jargon:

I went one afternoon to the church of my childhood and had a vision of what I must have really meant with &quot;Beat&quot;...the vision of the word Beat as being to mean beatific...People began to call themselves beatniks, beats, jazzniks, bopniks, buggies, and finally, I was called the &quot;avatar&quot; of all this.

In light of what he considered beat to mean and what beatnik had come to mean, Kerouac said to a reporter &quot;I&#x27;m not a beatnik. I&#x27;m a Catholic&quot;, showing the reporter a painting of Pope Paul VI and saying &quot;You know who painted that? Me.&quot;

==Stereotype==
In her memoir &quot;Minor Characters&quot;, Joyce Johnson described how the stereotype was absorbed into American culture:

Kerouac biographer Ann Charters noted that the term &quot;Beat&quot; was appropriated to become a Madison Avenue marketing tool:

Lee Streiff, an acquaintance of many members of the movement who went on to become one of its chroniclers, believed that the news media saddled the movement for the long term with a set of false images:

==Etymology==
The origin of the word &quot;beatnik&quot; is traditionally ascribed to Herb Caen from his column in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; on April 2, 1958, where he wrote &quot;&quot;Look&quot; magazine, preparing a picture spread on S.F.&#x27;s Beat Generation (oh, no, not AGAIN!), hosted a party in a No. Beach house for 50 Beatniks, and by the time word got around the sour grapevine, over 250 bearded cats and kits were on hand, slopping up Mike Cowles&#x27; free booze. They&#x27;re only Beat, y&#x27;know, when it comes to work ...&quot; It is claimed that Caen coined the term by adding the Yiddish suffix &quot;-nik&quot; to &quot;Beat&quot; as in the Beat Generation. Nik, as a suffix was also in vogue due to the Sputnik, the first satellite to orbit the planet, in 1957. The suffix came to be used in colloquial synthetics such as Nogoodnik, etc.

An earlier source from 1954, or possibly 1957 after the launch of Sputnik, is ascribed to Ethel (Etya) Gechtoff, the well-known owner of a San Francisco Art Gallery.

Objecting to the term, Allen Ginsberg wrote to &quot;The New York Times&quot; to deplore &quot;the foul word beatnik&quot;, commenting, &quot;If beatniks and not illuminated Beat poets overrun this country, they will have been created not by Kerouac but by industries of mass communication which continue to brainwash man.&quot;

==Beat culture==
In the vernacular of the period, &quot;Beat&quot; referred to Beat culture, attitude and literature; while &quot;beatnik&quot; referred to a stereotype found in cartoon drawings and (in some cases at worst) twisted, sometimes violent media characters. In 1995, film scholar Ray Carney wrote about the authentic beat attitude as differentiated from stereotypical media portrayals of the beatnik:
Much of Beat culture represented a negative stance rather than a positive one. It was animated more by a vague feeling of cultural and emotional displacement, dissatisfaction, and yearning, than by a specific purpose or program ... It was many different, conflicting, shifting states of mind.

Since 1958, the terms Beat Generation and Beat have been used to describe the antimaterialistic literary movement that began with Kerouac in the 1940s and continued into the 1960s. The Beat philosophy of antimaterialism and soul searching influenced 1960s musicians such as Bob Dylan, the early Pink Floyd and The Beatles.

However, the soundtrack of the beat movement was the modern jazz pioneered by saxophonist Charlie Parker and trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie, which the media dubbed bebop. Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg spent much of their time in New York jazz clubs such as the Royal Roost, Minton&#x27;s Playhouse, Birdland and the Open Door, &quot;shooting the breeze&quot; and &quot;digging the music&quot;. Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis rapidly became what Ginsberg dubbed &quot;secret heroes&quot; to this group of aesthetes. The Beat authors borrowed much from the jazz/hipster slang of the 1940s, peppering their works with words such as &quot;square&quot;, &quot;cats&quot;, &quot;cool&quot; and &quot;dig&quot;.

At the time the term &quot;beatnik&quot; was coined, a trend existed among young college students to adopt the stereotype. Men emulated the trademark look of bebop trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie by wearing goatees, horn-rimmed glasses and berets, rolling their own cigarettes, and playing bongos. Fashions for women included black leotards and long, straight, unadorned hair, in a rebellion against the middle-class culture of beauty salons. Marijuana use was associated with the subculture, and during the 1950s, Aldous Huxley&#x27;s &quot;The Doors of Perception&quot; further influenced views on drugs.

By 1960, a small &quot;beatnik&quot; group in Newquay, Cornwall, England (including a young Wizz Jones) had attracted the attention and abhorrence of their neighbours for growing their hair beyond shoulder length, resulting in a television interview with Alan Whicker on BBC television&#x27;s &quot;Tonight&quot; series.

The Beat philosophy was generally countercultural and antimaterialistic, and stressed the importance of bettering one&#x27;s inner self over material possessions. Some Beat writers, such as Gary Snyder, began to delve into Eastern religions such as Buddhism and Taoism. Politics tended to be liberal, left-wing and anti-war, with support for causes such as desegregation (although many of the figures associated with the original Beat movement, particularly Kerouac, embraced libertarian and conservative ideas). An openness to African American culture and arts was apparent in literature and music, notably jazz. While Caen and other writers implied a connection with communism, no obvious or direct connection occurred between Beat philosophy, as expressed by the literary movement&#x27;s leading authors, and that of the communist movement, other than the antipathy both philosophies shared towards capitalism. Those with only a superficial familiarity with the Beat movement often saw this similarity and assumed the two movements had more in common.

The Beat movement introduced Asian religions to Western society. These religions provided the Beat generation with new views of the world and corresponded with its desire to rebel against conservative middle-class values of the 1950s, old post-1930s radicalism, mainstream culture, and institutional religions in America.

By 1958, many Beat writers published writings on Buddhism. This was the year Jack Kerouac published his novel &quot;The Dharma Bums&quot;, whose central character (whom Kerouac based on himself) sought Buddhist contexts for events in his life.

Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s spiritual journey to India in 1963 also influenced the Beat movement. After studying religious texts alongside monks, Ginsberg deduced that what linked the function of poetry to Asian religions was their mutual goal of achieving ultimate truth. His discovery of Hindu mantra chants, a form of oral delivery, subsequently influenced Beat poetry. Beat pioneers who followed a Buddhism-influenced spiritual path felt that Asian religions offered a profound understanding of human nature and insights into the being, existence and reality of mankind. Many of the Beat advocates believed that the core concepts of Asian religious philosophies had the means of elevating American society&#x27;s consciousness, and these concepts informed their main ideologies.

Notable Beat writers such as Kerouac, Ginsberg, and Gary Snyder were drawn to Buddhism to the extent that they each, at different periods in their lives, followed a spiritual path in their quests to provide answers to universal questions and concepts. As a result, the Beat philosophy stressed the bettering of the inner self and the rejection of materialism, and postulated that East Asian religions could fill a religious and spiritual void in the lives of many Americans.

Many scholars speculate that Beat writers wrote about Eastern religions to encourage young people to practice spiritual and sociopolitical action. Progressive concepts from these religions, particularly those regarding personal freedom, influenced youth culture to challenge capitalist domination, break their generation&#x27;s dogmas, and reject traditional gender and racial rules.

===Beatnik art===
Beatnik art is the direction of contemporary art that originated in the United States as part of the beat movement in the 1960s. The movement itself, unlike the so-called &quot;Lost Generation&quot; did not set itself the task of changing society, but tried to distance itself from it, while at the same time trying to create its own counter-culture. The art created by artists was influenced by jazz, drugs, occultism, and other attributes of beat movement.

The scope of the activity was concentrated in the cultural circles of New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco and North Carolina. Prominent representatives of the trend were artists Wallace Berman, Jay DeFeo, Jess Collins, Robert Frank, Claes Oldenburg and Larry Rivers.

The culture of the beat generation has become a kind of intersection for representatives of the creative intellect of the United States associated with visual and performing art, which are usually attributed to other areas and trends of artistic expression, such as assemblage, happening, funk art and Neo-Dadaism. They made efforts to destroy the wall between art and real life, so that art would become a living experience in cafes or jazz clubs, and not remain the prerogative of galleries and museums. Many works of artists of the movement were created on the verge of various types of art.

Artists wrote poetry and poets painted, something like this can describe the processes taking place within the framework of the movement. Performances were a key element in the art of beats, whether it was the Theatrical Event of 1952 at Black Mountain College or Jack Kerouac typing in 1951 the novel &quot;On the Road&quot; on a typewriter in a single session on a single roll of 31-meter long paper.

Representatives of the movement were united by hostility to traditional culture with its conformism and brightly degenerate commercial component. They also did not like the approach of traditional culture to hushing up the dark side of American life – violence, corruption, social inequality, racism. They tried through art to create a new way of life based on the ideals of rebellion and freedom.

Critics highlight the artist Wallace Berman as the main representative of the movement. In his work concentrated many of the characteristic features of hipsters, especially in his collages made on photocopied photographs, which are a mixture of elements of pop art and mysticism. Among other artists and works, one can single out the work &quot;The Rose&quot; by the artist Jay DeFeo, the work on which was carried out for seven years, a huge painting-assembly weighing about a ton with a width of up to 20 centimeters.

==Beatniks in media==

*Possibly the first film portrayal of the Beat society was in the 1950 noir film &quot;D.O.A&quot;, directed by Rudolph Maté. In the film the main character goes to a loud San Francisco bar, where one woman shouts to the musicians: &quot;Cool! Cool! Really cool!&quot; One of the characters says, &quot;Man, am I really hip&quot;, and another replies, &quot;You&#x27;re from nowhere, nowhere!&quot; Lone dancers are seen moving to the beat. Some are dressed with accessories and have hairstyles that one would expect to see in much later films. Typical 1940s attire is mixed with beatnik clothing styles, particularly in one male who has a beatnik hat, long hair, and a mustache and goatee, but is still wearing a dress suit. The bartender refers to a patron as &quot;Jive Crazy&quot; and talks of the music driving its followers crazy. He then tells one man to &quot;Calm down Jack!&quot; and the man replies, &quot;Oh don&#x27;t bother me, man. I&#x27;m being enlightened!&quot;. The scene also demonstrates the connection to and influence of 1940s genres of African American music such as bebop on the emergence of Beat culture. The featured band &quot;Jive&quot; is all-black, while the customers who express their appreciation for the music in a jargon that would come to characterize the stereotype of Beat culture are young white hipsters.
*The 1953 Dalton Trumbo film &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; starring Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck features a supporting character played by Eddie Albert who is a stereotypical beatnik, appearing five years before the term was coined. He has an Eastern European surname, Radovich, and is a promiscuous photographer who wears baggy clothes, a striped T-shirt and a beard, which is mentioned four times in the screenplay.
*The character Maynard G. Krebs, played on TV by Bob Denver in &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot; (1959–63), solidified the stereotype of the indolent non-conformist beatnik, which contrasted with the aggressively rebellious Beat-related images presented by popular film actors of the early and mid-1950s, notably Marlon Brando and James Dean.
*&quot;The Beat Generation&quot; (1959) associated the movement with crime and violence, as did &quot;The Beatniks&quot; (1960). 
*An episode of &quot;The Addams Family&quot; titled &quot;The Addams Family Meets a Beatnik,&quot; broadcast January 1, 1965, features a young biker/beatnik who injures himself in an accident, and ends up staying with the Addams family. 
*Harry Connick Jr. portrays Dean, a beatnik, in Brad Bird&#x27;s film &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; (1999).

==Beatnik books==
Alan Bisbort&#x27;s survey &quot;Beatniks: A Guide to an American Subculture&quot; was published by Greenwood Press in 2009 as part of the series &quot;Greenwood Press Guides to Subcultures and Countercultures&quot;. The book includes a timeline, a glossary and biographical sketches. Others in the Greenwood series: &quot;Punks&quot;, &quot;Hippies&quot;, &quot;Goths&quot; and &quot;Flappers&quot;.

&quot;Tales of Beatnik Glory: Volumes I and II&quot; by Ed Sanders is, as its name suggests, a collection of short stories, and a definitive introduction to the beatnik scene as lived by its participants. The author, who went on to found The Fugs, lived in the beatnik epicenter of Greenwich Village and the Lower East Side in the late 1950s and early 1960s.

Among the humor books, &quot;Beat, Beat, Beat&quot; was a 1959 Signet paperback of cartoons by Phi Beta Kappa Princeton graduate William F. Brown, who looked down on the movement from his position in the TV department of the Batten, Barton, Durstine &amp; Osborn advertising agency.

&quot;Suzuki Beane&quot; (1961), by Sandra Scoppettone with Louise Fitzhugh illustrations, was a Bleecker Street beatnik spoof of Kay Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Eloise&quot; series (1956–1959).

In the 1960s comic book, the Justice League of America&#x27;s sidekick Snapper Carr was portrayed as a stereotypical beatnik, down to his lingo and clothes. The DC Comics character Jonny Double is portrayed as a beatnik.

==Museums==
In San Francisco, Jerry and Estelle Cimino operate their Beat Museum, which began in 2003 in Monterey, California and moved to San Francisco in 2006.

Ed &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Roth used fiberglass to build his Beatnik Bandit in 1960. Today, this car is in the National Automobile Museum in Reno, Nevada.

<text>The centrohelids or centroheliozoa are a large group of heliozoan protists. They include both mobile and sessile forms, found in freshwater and marine environments, especially at some depth.

==Characteristics==
Individuals are unicellular and spherical, usually around 30–80 μm in diameter, and covered with long radial axopods, narrow cellular projections that capture food and allow mobile forms to move about.

A few genera have no cell covering, but most have a gelatinous coat holding scales and spines, produced in special deposition vesicles. These may be organic or siliceous and come in various shapes and sizes. For instance, in &quot;Raphidiophrys&quot; the coat extends along the bases of the axopods, covering them with curved spicules that give them a pine-treeish look, and in &quot;Raphidiocystis&quot; there are both short cup-shaped spicules and long tubular spicules that are only a little shorter than the axopods. Some other common genera include &quot;Heterophrys&quot;, &quot;Actinocystis&quot;, and &quot;Oxnerella&quot;.

The axopods of centrohelids are supported by microtubules in a triangular-hexagonal array, which arise from a tripartite granule called the &quot;centroplast&quot; at the center of the cell. Axopods with a similar array occur in gymnosphaerids, which have traditionally been considered centrohelids (though sometimes in a separate order from the others). This was questioned when it was found they have mitochondria with tubular cristae, as do other heliozoa, while in centrohelids the cristae are flat. Although this is no longer considered a very reliable character, on balance gymnosphaerids seem to be a separate group.


== Taxonomy ==
=== History ===
The evolutionary position of the centrohelids is not clear. Structural comparisons with other groups are difficult, in part because no flagella occur among centrohelids, and genetic studies have been more or less inconclusive. Cavalier-Smith has suggested they may be related to the Rhizaria, but for the most part they are left with uncertain relations to other groups. A 2009 paper suggests that they may be related to the cryptophytes and haptophytes (see Cryptomonads-haptophytes assemblage). They are currently classified as Hacrobia, under the Plants+HC clade, although some research studies have found evidence against the monophyly of this group.
Centrohelids were previously divided into two orders with contrasting scale morphology and ultrastructure: Pterocystida and Acanthocystida. Posterior molecular studies of 2018 have rearranged the classification of centrohelids into two taxa: Pterocystida and Panacanthocystida, which includes both Acanthocystida and the genus &quot;Yogsothoth&quot;.

<text>The Pharaoh Hound or is a Maltese breed of hunting dog. It is traditionally used for rabbit-hunting in the rocky terrain of the islands; the Maltese name means &quot;rabbit dog&quot;. 

It is classified by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in its &quot;Spitz and primitive&quot; group, and shows similarities to other Mediterranean breeds in that group such as the Cirneco dell&#x27;Etna, the Podenco Andaluz, the Podenco Canario, the Podenco Ibicenco and the Portuguese Podengo. It is the only Maltese dog breed with international recognition.

== History ==
The Kelb tal-Fenek is a traditional breed of rural Malta. As the English-language exonym suggests, it is sometimes claimed that the Pharaoh Hound descends from the dogs shown in the tomb paintings of Ancient Egypt. Modern DNA studies suggest that the breed is not of ancient origin, but a moderately recent development from various other breeds. It apparently became genetically distinct from the Sicilian Cirneco dell&#x27;Etna no more than two hundred years ago.

In 1647 Giovanni Francesco Abela, in his &quot;Della Descrittione di Malta isola nel Mare Siciliano: con le sue antichità, ed altre notizie&quot;, wrote &quot;... we have the dogs called Cernechi, much valued for rabbit-hunting, which are often in demand as far away as France, mainly for [use in] steep and stony mountain terrain&quot;. Some have taken this to refer to the Kelb tal-Fenek. The modern Cirneco is a Sicilian breed of similar structure and appearance to the Kelb tal-Fenek, but somewhat smaller.

The first litter to be born outside Malta was in the United Kingdom in 1963. The breed was accepted by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale as the &quot;Pharaoh Hound&quot; in the same year, under the patronage of the UK. A breed standard was approved by the British Kennel Club in 1974.

==Appearance==
The Kelb tal-Fenek is slender and graceful. The head is long and finely chiselled, with a slight stop. The coat is glossy and short. It may be chestnut or tan; white patches on the back, sides, shoulder or back of the neck are a disqualifying characteristic, but the tip of the tail may be white. The eyes are amber-coloured. The dogs have an unusual trait of &quot;blushing&quot; when excited or happy, with their ears and noses becoming bright pink.

It has little genetic pre-disposition to disease, and may be expected to live for some 11 to 14 years.

== Use ==

The Kelb tal-Fenek is usually taken out to hunt at night when there are fewer distractions. Generally, the hunters take their dogs into the countryside and release pairs of a male and a female dog in each compass direction. The dogs then search out their prey using scent. When a rabbit is found the hounds give chase, the small and more agile female in the lead with the male keeping the rabbit from darting too far to the sides. At this point the dogs giving chase emit a high pitched bark, attracting the other dogs and the hunters, all of whom come running. By the time the hunters and other dogs arrive the rabbit has almost always gone to ground. The hunters then gather and leash all but one dog, then place nets over all of the likely escape holes of the rabbit. Finally the hunter takes a ferret (with a small bell attached) from a round wicker basket, and places it into the last entrance to the rabbit&#x27;s burrow. The Kelb tal-Fenek can hear the little bell up to 3 metres down under the rocky terrain. When the ferret flushes the rabbit out a hole, one free dog swoops down upon it. The use of ferrets is mentioned by Strabo about rabbit-hunting in the Balearic Islands under Roman rule.

<doc id="62389" wikidata="Q903002" url="?curid=62389" title="Langmuir probe">
<text>A Langmuir probe is a device used to determine the electron temperature, electron density, and electric potential of a plasma. It works by inserting one or more electrodes into a plasma, with a constant or time-varying electric potential between the various electrodes or between them and the surrounding vessel. The measured currents and potentials in this system allow the determination of the physical properties of the plasma.

==&quot;I-V&quot; characteristic of the Debye sheath==

The beginning of Langmuir probe theory is the &quot;I–V&quot; characteristic of the Debye sheath, that is, the current density flowing to a surface in a plasma as a function of the voltage drop across the sheath. The analysis presented here indicates how the electron temperature, electron density, and plasma potential can be derived from the &quot;I–V&quot; characteristic. In some situations a more detailed analysis can yield information on the ion density (formula_1), the ion temperature formula_2, or the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) or formula_3.

===Ion saturation current density===

Consider first a surface biased to a large negative voltage. If the voltage is large enough, essentially all electrons (and any negative ions) will be repelled. The ion velocity will satisfy the Bohm sheath criterion, which is, strictly speaking, an inequality, but which is usually marginally fulfilled. The Bohm criterion in its marginal form says that the ion velocity at the sheath edge is simply the sound speed given by

formula_4.

The ion temperature term is often neglected, which is justified if the ions are cold. &quot;Z&quot; is the (average) charge state of the ions, and formula_5 is the adiabatic coefficient for the ions. The proper choice of formula_5 is a matter of some contention. Most analyses use formula_7, corresponding to isothermal ions, but some kinetic theory suggests that formula_8. For formula_9 and formula_10, using the larger value results in the conclusion that the density is formula_11 times smaller. Uncertainties of this magnitude arise several places in the analysis of Langmuir probe data and are very difficult to resolve.

The charge density of the ions depends on the charge state &quot;Z&quot;, but quasineutrality allows one to write it simply in terms of the electron density as formula_12, where formula_13 is the charge of an electron and formula_14 is the number density of electrons.

Using these results we have the current density to the surface due to the ions. The current density at large negative voltages is due solely to the ions and, except for possible sheath expansion effects, does not depend on the bias voltage, so it is
referred to as the ion saturation current density and is given by

formula_15 where formula_16 is as defined above.

The plasma parameters, in particular, the density, are those at the sheath edge.

===Exponential electron current===

As the voltage of the Debye sheath is reduced, the more energetic electrons are able to overcome the potential barrier of the electrostatic sheath. We can model the electrons at the sheath edge with a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, i.e.,

formula_17,

except that the high energy tail moving away from the surface is missing, because only the lower energy electrons moving toward the surface are reflected. The higher energy electrons overcome the sheath potential and are absorbed. The mean velocity of the electrons which are able to overcome the voltage of the sheath is

formula_18,

where the cut-off velocity for the upper integral is

formula_19.

formula_20 is the voltage across the Debye sheath, that is, the potential at the sheath edge minus the potential of the surface. For a large voltage compared to the electron temperature, the result is

formula_21.

With this expression, we can write the electron contribution to the current to the probe in terms of the ion saturation current as

formula_22,

valid as long as the electron current is not more than two or three times the ion current.

===Floating potential===

The total current, of course, is the sum of the ion and electron currents:

formula_23.

We are using the convention that current &quot;from&quot; the surface into the plasma is positive. An interesting and practical question is the potential of a surface to which no net current flows. It is easily seen from the above equation that

formula_24.

If we introduce the ion reduced mass formula_25, we can write

formula_26

Since the floating potential is the experimentally accessible quantity, the current (below electron saturation) is usually written as 

formula_27.

=== Electron saturation current ===

When the electrode potential is equal to or greater than the plasma potential, then there is no longer a sheath to reflect electrons, and the electron current saturates. Using the Boltzmann expression for the mean electron velocity given above with formula_28 and setting the ion current to zero, the electron saturation current density would be

formula_29

Although this is the expression usually given in theoretical discussions of Langmuir probes, the derivation is not rigorous and the experimental basis is weak. The theory of double layers typically employs an expression analogous to the Bohm criterion, but with the roles of electrons and ions reversed, namely

formula_30

where the numerical value was found by taking &quot;T&quot;&quot;i&quot;=&quot;T&quot;&quot;e&quot; and γ&quot;i&quot;=γ&quot;e&quot;.

In practice, it is often difficult and usually considered uninformative to measure the electron saturation current experimentally. When it is measured, it is found to be highly variable and generally much lower (a factor of three or more) than the value given above. Often a clear saturation is not seen at all. Understanding electron saturation is one of the most important outstanding problems of Langmuir probe theory.

==Effects of the bulk plasma==

The Debye sheath theory explains the basic behavior of Langmuir probes, but is not complete. Merely inserting an object like a probe into a plasma changes the density, temperature, and potential at the sheath edge and perhaps everywhere. Changing the voltage on the probe will also, in general, change various plasma parameters. Such effects are less well understood than sheath physics, but they can at least in some cases be roughly accounted.

===Pre-sheath===

The Bohm criterion requires the ions to enter the Debye sheath at the sound speed. The potential drop that accelerates them to this speed is called the pre-sheath. It has a spatial scale that depends on the physics of the ion source but which is large compared to the Debye length and often of the order of the plasma dimensions. The magnitude of the potential drop is equal to (at least)

formula_31

The acceleration of the ions also entails a decrease in the density, usually by a factor of about 2 depending on the details.

===Resistivity===

Collisions between ions and electrons will also affect the &quot;I-V&quot; characteristic of a Langmuir probe. When an electrode is biased to any voltage other than the floating potential, the current it draws must pass through the plasma, which has a finite resistivity. The resistivity and current path can be calculated with relative ease in an unmagnetized plasma. In a magnetized plasma, the problem is much more difficult. In either case, the effect is to add a voltage drop proportional to the current drawn, which shears the characteristic. The deviation from an exponential function is usually not possible to observe directly, so that the flattening of the characteristic is usually misinterpreted as a larger plasma temperature. Looking at it from the other side, any measured &quot;I-V&quot; characteristic can be interpreted as a hot plasma, where most of the voltage is dropped in the Debye sheath, or as a cold plasma, where most of the voltage is dropped in the bulk plasma. Without quantitative modeling of the bulk resistivity, Langmuir probes can only give an upper limit on the electron temperature.

===Sheath expansion===

It is not enough to know the current &quot;density&quot; as a function of bias voltage since it is the &quot;absolute&quot; current which is measured. In an unmagnetized plasma, the current-collecting area is usually taken to be the exposed surface area of the electrode. In a magnetized plasma, the projected area is taken, that is, the area of the electrode as viewed along the magnetic field. If the electrode is not shadowed by a wall or other nearby object, then the area must be doubled to account for current coming along the field from both sides. If the electrode dimensions are not small in comparison to the Debye length, then the size of the electrode is effectively increased in all directions by the sheath thickness. In a magnetized plasma, the electrode is sometimes assumed to be increased in a similar way by the ion Larmor radius.

The finite Larmor radius allows some ions to reach the electrode that would have otherwise gone past it. The details of the effect have not been calculated in a fully self-consistent way.

If we refer to the probe area including these effects as formula_32 (which may be a function of the bias voltage) and make the assumptions
*formula_10,
*formula_9
*formula_8, and
*formula_36,
and ignore the effects of
*bulk resistivity, and
*electron saturation,
then the &quot;I-V&quot; characteristic becomes

formula_37,

where

formula_38.

===Magnetized plasmas===

The theory of Langmuir probes is much more complex when the plasma is magnetized. The simplest extension of the unmagnetized case is simply to use the projected area rather than the surface area of the electrode. For a long cylinder far from other surfaces, this reduces the effective area by a factor of π/2 = 1.57. As mentioned before, it might be necessary to increase the radius by about the thermal ion Larmor radius, but not above the effective area for the unmagnetized case.

The use of the projected area seems to be closely tied with the existence of a magnetic sheath. Its scale is the ion Larmor radius at the sound speed, which is normally between the scales of the Debye sheath and the pre-sheath. The Bohm criterion for ions entering the magnetic sheath applies to the motion along the field, while at the entrance to the Debye sheath it applies to the motion normal to the surface. This results in a reduction of the density by the sine of the angle between the field and the surface. The associated increase in the Debye length must be taken into account when considering ion non-saturation due to sheath effects.

Especially interesting and difficult to understand is the role of cross-field currents. Naively, one would expect the current to be parallel to the magnetic field along a flux tube. In many geometries, this flux tube will end at a surface in a distant part of the device, and this spot should itself exhibit an &quot;I-V&quot; characteristic. The net result would be the measurement of a double-probe characteristic; in other words, electron saturation current equal to the ion saturation current.

When this picture is considered in detail, it is seen that the flux tube must charge up and the surrounding plasma must spin around it. The current into or out of the flux tube must be associated with a force that slows down this spinning. Candidate forces are viscosity, friction with neutrals, and inertial forces associated with plasma flows, either steady or fluctuating. It is not known which force is strongest in practice, and in fact it is generally difficult to find any force that is powerful enough to explain the characteristics actually measured.

It is also likely that the magnetic field plays a decisive role in determining the level of electron saturation, but no quantitative theory is as yet available.

==Electrode configurations==

Once one has a theory of the &quot;I-V&quot; characteristic of an electrode, one can proceed to measure it and then fit the data with the theoretical curve to extract the plasma parameters. The straightforward way to do this is to sweep the voltage on a single electrode, but, for a number of reasons, configurations using multiple electrodes or exploring only a part of the characteristic are used in practice.

===Single probe===

The most straightforward way to measure the &quot;I-V&quot; characteristic of a plasma is with a single probe, consisting of one electrode biased with a voltage ramp relative to the vessel. The advantages are simplicity of the electrode and redundancy of information, i.e. one can check whether the &quot;I-V&quot; characteristic has the expected form. Potentially additional information can be extracted from details of the characteristic. The disadvantages are more complex biasing and measurement electronics and a poor time resolution. If fluctuations are present (as they always are) and the sweep is slower than the fluctuation frequency (as it usually is), then the &quot;I-V&quot; is the &quot;average&quot; current as a function of voltage, which may result in systematic errors if it is analyzed as though it were an instantaneous &quot;I-V&quot;. The ideal situation is to sweep the voltage at a frequency above the fluctuation frequency but still below the ion cyclotron frequency. This, however, requires sophisticated electronics and a great deal of care.

===Double probe===

An electrode can be biased relative to a second electrode, rather than to the ground. The theory is similar to that of a single probe, except that the current is limited to the ion saturation current for both positive and negative voltages. In particular, if formula_39 is the voltage applied between two identical electrodes, the current is given by;

formula_40,

which can be rewritten using formula_41 as a hyperbolic tangent:

formula_42.

One advantage of the double probe is that neither electrode is ever very far above floating, so the theoretical uncertainties at large electron currents are avoided. If it is desired to sample more of the exponential electron portion of the characteristic, an asymmetric double probe may be used, with one electrode larger than the other. If the ratio of the collection areas is larger than the square root of the ion to electron mass ratio, then this arrangement is equivalent to the single tip probe. If the ratio of collection areas is not that big, then the characteristic will be in-between the symmetric double tip configuration and the single-tip configuration. If formula_43 is the area of the larger tip then:

formula_44

Another advantage is that there is no reference to the vessel, so it is to some extent immune to the disturbances in a radio frequency plasma. On the other hand, it shares the limitations of a single probe concerning complicated electronics and poor time resolution. In addition, the second electrode not only complicates the system, but it makes it susceptible to disturbance by gradients in the plasma.

===Triple probe===

An elegant electrode configuration is the triple probe, consisting of two electrodes biased with a fixed voltage and a third which is floating. The bias voltage is chosen to be a few times the electron temperature so that the negative electrode draws the ion saturation current, which, like the floating potential, is directly measured. A common rule of thumb for this voltage bias is 3/e times the expected electron temperature. Because the biased tip configuration is floating, the positive probe can draw at most an electron current only equal in magnitude and opposite in polarity to the ion saturation current drawn by the negative probe, given by :

formula_45

and as before the floating tip draws effectively no current:

formula_46.

Assuming that: 
1.) The electron energy distribution in the plasma is Maxwellian,
2.) The mean free path of the electrons is greater than the ion sheath about the tips and larger than the probe radius, and
3.) the probe sheath sizes are much smaller than the probe separation,
then the current to any probe can be considered composed of two partsthe high energy tail of the Maxwellian electron distribution, and the ion saturation current:

formula_47

where the current &quot;Ie&quot; is thermal current. Specifically,

formula_48,

where &quot;S&quot; is surface area, &quot;Je&quot; is electron current density, and &quot;ne&quot; is electron density.

Assuming that the ion and electron saturation current is the same for each probe, then the formulas for current to each of the probe tips take the form

formula_49

formula_50

formula_51.

It is then simple to show

formula_52

but the relations from above specifying that &quot;I+=-I−&quot; and &quot;Ifl&quot;=0 give

formula_53,

a transcendental equation in terms of applied and measured voltages and the unknown &quot;Te&quot; that in the limit &quot;qeVBias = qe(V+-V−) » k Te&quot;, becomes

formula_54.

That is, the voltage difference between the positive and floating electrodes is proportional to the electron temperature. (This was especially important in the sixties and seventies before sophisticated data processing became widely available.)

More sophisticated analysis of triple probe data can take into account such factors as incomplete saturation, non-saturation, unequal areas.

Triple probes have the advantage of simple biasing electronics (no sweeping required), simple data analysis, excellent time resolution, and insensitivity to potential fluctuations (whether imposed by an rf source or inherent fluctuations). Like double probes, they are sensitive to gradients in plasma parameters.

===Special arrangements===

Arrangements with four (tetra probe) or five (penta probe) have sometimes been used, but the advantage over triple probes has never been entirely convincing. The spacing between probes must be larger than the Debye length of the plasma to prevent an overlapping Debye sheath.

A pin-plate probe consists of a small electrode directly in front of a large electrode, the idea being that the voltage sweep of the large probe can perturb the plasma potential at the sheath edge and thereby aggravate the difficulty of interpreting the &quot;I-V&quot; characteristic. The floating potential of the small electrode can be used to correct for changes in potential at the sheath edge of the large probe. Experimental results from this arrangement look promising, but experimental complexity and residual difficulties in the interpretation have prevented this configuration from becoming standard.

Various geometries have been proposed for use as ion temperature probes, for example, two cylindrical tips that rotate past each other in a magnetized plasma. Since shadowing effects depend on the ion Larmor radius, the results can be interpreted in terms of ion temperature. The ion temperature is an important quantity that is very difficult to measure. Unfortunately, it is also very difficult to analyze such probes in a fully self-consistent way.

Emissive probes use an electrode heated either electrically or by the exposure to the plasma. When the electrode is biased more positive than the plasma potential, the emitted electrons are pulled back to the surface so the &quot;I&quot;-&quot;V&quot; characteristic is hardly changed. As soon as the electrode is biased negative with respect to the plasma potential, the emitted electrons are repelled and contribute a large negative current. The onset of this current or, more sensitively, the onset of a discrepancy between the characteristics of an unheated and a heated electrode, is a sensitive indicator of the plasma potential.

To measure fluctuations in plasma parameters, arrays of electrodes are used, usually onebut occasionally two-dimensional. A typical array has a spacing of 1 mm and a total of 16 or 32 electrodes. A simpler arrangement to measure fluctuations is a negatively biased electrode flanked by two floating electrodes. The ion-saturation current is taken as a surrogate for the density and the floating potential as a surrogate for the plasma potential. This allows a rough measurement of the turbulent particle flux

formula_55

==Cylindrical Langmuir probe in electron flow==

Most often, the Langmuir probe is a small sized electrode inserted into a plasma which is connected to an external circuit that measures the properties of the plasma with respect to ground. The ground is typically an electrode with a large surface area and is usually in contact with the same plasma (very often the metallic wall of the chamber). This allows the probe to measure the I-V characteristic of the plasma. The probe measures the characteristic current formula_56 of the plasma when the probe is biased with a potential formula_57.

Relations between the probe I-V characteristic and parameters of isotropic plasma were found by Irving Langmuir and they can be derived most elementary for the planar probe of a large surface area formula_58 (ignoring the edge effects problem). Let us choose the point formula_59 in plasma at the distance formula_60 from the probe surface where electric field of the probe is negligible while each electron of plasma passing this point could reach the probe surface without collisions with plasma components: formula_61, formula_62 is the Debye length and formula_63 is the electron free path calculated for its total cross section with plasma components. In the vicinity of the point formula_59 we can imagine a small element of the surface area formula_65 parallel to the probe surface. The elementary current formula_66 of plasma electrons passing throughout formula_65 in a direction of the probe surface can be written in the form

where formula_68 is a scalar of the electron thermal velocity vector formula_69,

formula_70 is the element of the solid angle with its relative value formula_71, formula_72 is the angle between perpendicular to the probe surface recalled from the point formula_59 and the radius-vector of the electron thermal velocity formula_69 forming a spherical layer of thickness formula_75 in velocity space, and formula_76 is the electron distribution function normalized to unity

Taking into account uniform conditions along the probe surface (boundaries are excluded), formula_77, we can take double integral with respect to the angle formula_78, and with respect to the velocity formula_79, from the expression (), after substitution Eq. () in it, to calculate a total electron current on the probe

^\infty f(v)dv \int\limits_0^\zeta v\cos \vartheta 2\pi \sin \vartheta d\vartheta&lt;/math&gt;.|}}

whereformula_57 is the probe potential with respect to the potential of plasma formula_81, formula_82 is the lowest electron velocity value at which the electron still could reach the probe surface charged to the potential formula_57, formula_84 is the upper limit of the angle formula_72 at which the electron having initial velocity formula_68 can still reach the probe surface with a zero-value of its velocity at this surface. That means the value formula_84 is defined by the condition

Deriving the value formula_84 from Eq. () and substituting it in Eq. (), we can obtain the probe I-V characteristic (neglecting the ion current) in the range of the probe potential formula_89 in the form

Differentiating Eq. () twice with respect to the potential formula_57, one can find the expression describing the second derivative of the probe I-V characteristic (obtained firstly by M. J. Druyvestein 

defining the electron distribution function over velocity formula_91 in the evident form. M. J. Druyvestein has shown in particular that Eqs. () and () are valid for description of operation of the probe of any arbitrary convex geometrical shape. 
 Substituting the Maxwellian distribution function:

\frac{v^2}{v_p^3}\exp \left (-v^2/v_p^2\right )&lt;/math&gt;,|}}

where formula_92 is the most probable velocity, in Eq. () we obtain the expression

From which the very useful in practice relation follows

allowing one to derive the electron energy formula_93 (for Maxwellian distribution function only!) by a slope of the probe I-V characteristic in a semilogarithmic scale. 
Thus in plasmas with isotropic electron distributions, the electron current formula_94 on a surface formula_95 of the cylindrical Langmuir probe at plasma potential formula_81 is defined by the average electron thermal velocity formula_97 and can be written down as equation (see Eqs. (), () at formula_81)

where formula_99 is the electron concentration, formula_100 is the probe radius, and formula_101 is its length. 
It is obvious that if plasma electrons form an electron wind (flow) across the cylindrical probe axis with a velocity formula_102, the expression

holds true. 
In plasmas produced by gas-discharge arc sources as well as inductively coupled sources, the electron wind can develop the Mach number formula_103 . Here the parameter formula_104 is introduced along with the Mach number for simplification of mathematical expressions. Note that formula_105, whereformula_106 is the most probable velocity for the Maxwellian distribution function, so that formula_107 . Thus the general case where formula_108 is of the theoretical and practical interest. 
Corresponding physical and mathematical considerations presented in Refs. [9,10] has shown that at the Maxwellian distribution function of the electrons in a reference system moving with the velocity formula_109 across axis of the cylindrical probe set at plasma potential formula_81, the electron current on the probe can be written down in the form

where formula_111 and formula_112 are Bessel functions of imaginary arguments and Eq. () is reduced to Eq. () atformula_113 being reduced to Eq. () at formula_114 . 
The second derivative of the probe I-V characteristic formula_115 with respect to the probe potential formula_57 can be presented in this case in the form (see Fig. 3)

\int \limits_0^\pi (\sqrt{x}- \cos \varphi) \exp\left ( -\alpha ^2 (\sqrt{x} - \cos \varphi)\right ) d\varphi&lt;/math&gt;,|}}

where

and the electron energy formula_117 is expressed in eV.

All parameters of the electron population: formula_99, formula_119, formula_120 and formula_106 in plasma can be derived from the experimental probe I-V characteristic second derivative formula_115 by its least square best fitting with the theoretical curve expressed by Eq. (). For detail and for problem of the general case of none-Maxwellian electron distribution functions see., 

==Practical considerations==

For laboratory and technical plasmas, the electrodes are most commonly tungsten or tantalum wires several thousandths of an inch thick, because they have a high melting point but can be made small enough not to perturb the plasma. Although the melting point is somewhat lower, molybdenum is sometimes used because it is easier to machine and solder than tungsten. For fusion plasmas, graphite electrodes with dimensions from 1 to 10 mm are usually used because they can withstand the highest power loads (also sublimating at high temperatures rather than melting), and result in reduced bremsstrahlung radiation (with respect to metals) due to the low atomic number of carbon. The electrode surface exposed to the plasma must be defined, e.g. by insulating all but the tip of a wire electrode. If there can be significant deposition of conducting materials (metals or graphite), then the insulator should be separated from the electrode by a to prevent short-circuiting.

In a magnetized plasma, it appears to be best to choose a probe size a few times larger than the ion Larmor radius. A point of contention is whether it is better to use proud probes, where the angle between the magnetic field and the surface is at least 15°, or flush-mounted probes, which are embedded in the plasma-facing components and generally have an angle of 1 to 5 °. Many plasma physicists feel more comfortable with proud probes, which have a longer tradition and possibly are less perturbed by electron saturation effects, although this is disputed. Flush-mounted probes, on the other hand, being part of the wall, are less perturbative. Knowledge of the field angle is necessary with proud probes to determine the fluxes to the wall, whereas it is necessary with flush-mounted probes to determine the density.

In very hot and dense plasmas, as found in fusion research, it is often necessary to limit the thermal load to the probe by limiting the exposure time. A reciprocating probe is mounted on an arm that is moved into and back out of the plasma, usually in about one second by means of either a pneumatic drive or an electromagnetic drive using the ambient magnetic field. Pop-up probes are similar, but the electrodes rest behind a shield and are only moved the few millimeters necessary to bring them into the plasma near the wall.

A Langmuir probe can be purchased off the shelf for on the order of 15,000 U.S. dollars, or they can be built by an experienced researcher or technician. When working at frequencies under 100 MHz, it is advisable to use blocking filters, and take necessary grounding precautions.

In low temperature plasmas, in which the probe does not get hot, surface contamination may become an issue. This effect can cause hysteresis in the I-V curve and may limit the current collected by the probe. A heating mechanism or a glow discharge plasma may be used to clean the probe and prevent misleading results.

<doc id="62390" wikidata="Q111332" url="?curid=62390" title="Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature Film">
<text>The Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature Film is an award for documentary films. In 1941, the first awards for feature-length documentaries were bestowed as Special Awards to &quot;Kukan&quot; and &quot;Target for Tonight&quot;. They have since been bestowed competitively each year, with the exception of 1946. Copies of every winning film (along with copies of most nominees) are held by the Academy Film Archive.

== Winners and nominees ==
Following the Academy&#x27;s practice, films are listed below by the award year (that is, the year they were released under the Academy&#x27;s rules for eligibility). In practice, due to the limited nature of documentary distribution, a film may be released in different years in different venues, sometimes years after production is complete.
=== 1940s ===
=== 1950s ===
=== 1960s ===
=== 1970s ===
=== 1980s ===

=== 1990s ===

===2000s=== 

=== 2010s ===

=== 2020s ===

==Shortlisted finalists==

Finalists for Best Documentary Feature are selected by the Documentary Branch based on a preliminary ballot. A second preferential ballot determines the five nominees. Prior to the 78th Academy Awards, there were twelve films shortlisted.

== Superlatives ==

For this Academy Award category, the following superlatives emerge:
* Most awards: 
Arthur Cohn 3 awards &quot;(resulting from 4 nominations)&quot;;
Simon Chinn 2 awards;
Jacques-Yves Cousteau 2 awards;
Walt Disney 2 awards &quot;(resulting from 7 nominations; Disney has an additional 2 wins in the Documentary Short Subject category)&quot;;
Rob Epstein 2 awards;
Marvin Hier 2 awards;
Barbara Kopple 2 awards
Mark Jonathan Harris 2 awards

== Process controversies ==
Michael Moore&#x27;s &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;, at the time the highest-grossing documentary film in movie history, was ruled ineligible because Moore had opted to have it played on television prior to the 2004 election. Previously, the 1982 winner &quot;Just Another Missing Kid&quot; had already been broadcast in Canada and won that country&#x27;s ACTRA award for excellence in television at the time of its nomination.

In 1990, a group of 45 filmmakers filed a protest to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences over a potential conflict of interest involving Mitchell Block. They noted that Block was a member of the Documentary Steering Committee, which selects films as nominees, but he had a conflict of interest because his company Direct Cinema owned the distribution rights to three of the five films (including eventual winner &quot;Common Threads: Stories from the Quilt&quot; selected that year as nominees for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. They noted that Michael Moore&#x27;s &quot;Roger &amp; Me&quot; (distributed by Warner Brothers) was omitted from the nominees, although it had been highly praised by numerous critics and was ranked by many critics as one of the top ten films of the year.

The controversy over &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot;″ exclusion was enough to have the Academy Awards begin the process to change its documentary voting system. Roger Ebert, who had declared it to be the best 1994 movie of any kind, looked into its failure to receive a nomination: &quot;We learned, through very reliable sources, that the members of the committee had a system. They carried little flashlights. When one gave up on a film, he waved a light on the screen. When a majority of flashlights had voted, the film was switched off. &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; was stopped after 15 minutes.&quot;

The Academy&#x27;s executive director, Bruce Davis, took the unprecedented step of asking accounting firm Price Waterhouse to turn over the complete results of that year&#x27;s voting, in which members of the committee had rated each of the 63 eligible documentaries on a scale of six to ten. &quot;What I found,&quot; said Davis, &quot;is that a small group of members gave zeros (actually low scores) to every single film except the five they wanted to see nominated. And they gave tens to those five, which completely skewed the voting. There was one film that received more scores of ten than any other, but it wasn&#x27;t nominated. It also got zeros (low scores) from those few voters, and that was enough to push it to sixth place.&quot;

In 2000, Arthur Cohn, the producer of the winning &quot;One Day in September&quot; boasted &quot;I won this without showing it in a single theater!&quot; Cohn had hit upon the tactic of showing his Oscar entries at invitation-only screenings, and to as few other people as possible. Oscar bylaws at the time required voters to have seen all five nominated documentaries; by limiting his audience, Cohn shrank the voting pool and improved his odds. Following protests by many documentarians, the nominating system was subsequently changed.

&quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; director Steve James said &quot;With so few people looking at any given film, it only takes one to dislike a film, and its chances for making the shortlist are diminished greatly. So they&#x27;ve got to do something, I think, to make the process more sane for deciding the shortlist.&quot; Among other rule changes taking effect in 2013, the academy began requiring a documentary to have been reviewed by either &quot;The New York Times&quot; or &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and be commercially released for at least one week in both of those cities. Advocating the rule change, Michael Moore said &quot;When people get the award for best documentary and they go on stage and thank the Academy, it&#x27;s not really the Academy, is it? It&#x27;s 5% of the Academy.&quot;

The awards process has also been criticized for emphasizing a documentary&#x27;s subject matter over its style or quality. In 2009, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; Owen Gleiberman wrote about the documentary branch members&#x27; penchant for choosing &quot;movies that the selection committee deemed good because they&#x27;re good for you... a kind of self-defeating aesthetic of granola documentary correctness.&quot;

In 2014, following the announcement of the shortlist of eligible feature documentary nominees, Sony Pictures Classics co-president Tom Bernard publicly criticized Academy documentary voters after they excluded SPC&#x27;s &quot;Red Army&quot; from the shortlist. &quot;It&#x27;s a sign of some really old people in the documentary area of the Academy. There&#x27;s a lot of people who are really up in their years. It&#x27;s shocking to me that that film (&quot;Red Army&quot;) didn&#x27;t get in,&quot; Bernard said. Additionally, in his reporting of the Oscar documentary shortlist exclusions that year, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; Scott Feinberg reacted to &quot;Red Army&quot; omission: &quot;...no matter which 15 titles the doc branch selected, plenty of other great ones would be left on the outside. That is the case, most egregiously, with Gabe Polsky&#x27;s &quot;Red Army&quot; (Sony Classics), a masterful look at the role of sports in society and Russian-American relations&quot;. (&quot;Icarus&quot;, another documentary related to sports and Russian-American relations, later won the Oscar.)

In 2017, following the win of the eight-hour &quot;O.J.: Made in America&quot; in this category, the Academy announced that multi-part and limited series would be ineligible for the award in the future, even if they are not broadcast after their Oscar-qualifying release (as was &quot;O.J.: Made in America&quot;).

Various other acclaimed documentaries have not been nominated such as:
*&quot;Dont Look Back&quot; (1967)
*&quot;Salesman&quot; (1969)
*&quot;Gimme Shelter&quot; (1970)

== Documentaries with wins or nominations in other categories ==
Though Academy rules do not expressly preclude documentaries from being nominated in other competitive categories, documentaries are typically considered ineligible for nominations in categories that presume the work is fictitious, including Best Production Design, Best Costume Design, and acting. To date, no documentaries have been nominated for Best Picture, or Best Director. &quot;The Quiet One&quot; was nominated for Best Story and Screenplay.

No documentary feature has yet been nominated for Best Picture, although &quot;Chang&quot; was nominated in the &quot;Unique and Artistic Production&quot; category at the 1927/28 awards.

At the 3rd Academy Awards, prior to the introduction of a documentary category, &quot;With Byrd at the South Pole&quot; won the award for Best Cinematography, becoming the first documentary both to be nominated for and win an Oscar. 1952&#x27;s &quot;Navajo&quot; would become the first film nominated for both Best Documentary and Best Cinematography.

&quot;Woodstock&quot; was the first documentary to be nominated for Best Film Editing while &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; was the second (although it was, controversially, not nominated for Best Documentary Feature). &quot;Woodstock&quot; is also the only documentary to receive a nomination for Best Sound.

&quot;Honeyland&quot; became the first documentary to be nominated for both Best International Feature Film and Best Documentary Feature. The following year, &quot;Collective&quot; would accomplish the same double nomination. Prior to this, &quot;Waltz with Bashir&quot; became the first documentary and first animated film nominated for Best International Feature Film, although it was not nominated for Best Documentary Feature. The Danish-language animated documentary &quot;Flee&quot; was later nominated for Best International Feature, Best Documentary Feature, and Best Animated Feature, the first film to accomplish this feat.

Nine documentaries have received nominations for Best Original Song: &quot;Mondo Cane&quot; (for Riz Ortolani and Nino Oliviero&#x27;s &quot;More&quot;), &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot; (for Melissa Etheridge&#x27;s &quot;I Need to Wake Up&quot;, the only nominee from a documentary to win), &quot;Chasing Ice&quot; (for J. Ralph&#x27;s &quot;Before My Time&quot;), &quot;Racing Extinction&quot; (for Ralph and Anhoni&#x27;s &quot;Manta Ray&quot;), &quot;&quot; (for Ralph and Sting&#x27;s &quot;The Empty Chair&quot;), &quot;Glen Campbell: I&#x27;ll Be Me&quot; (for Glen Campbell and Julian Raymond&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Not Gonna Miss You&quot;), &quot;The Hunting Ground&quot; (for Lady Gaga and Diane Warren&#x27;s &quot;Til It Happens To You&quot;), &quot;RBG&quot; (for Warren&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Fight&quot;) and &quot;&quot;American Symphony&quot;&quot; (for Batiste&#x27;s &quot;It Never Went Away&quot;).

Documentaries nominated for their scores include &quot;This is Cinerama&quot;, &quot;White Wilderness&quot; (which also won for Documentary Feature), &quot;Let It Be&quot;, and &quot;Birds Do It, Bees Do It&quot;.

Five documentary filmmakers have received honorary Oscars: Pete Smith, William L. Hendricks, D. A. Pennebaker, Frederick Wiseman, and Agnès Varda.

<doc id="62392" wikidata="Q1198122" url="?curid=62392" title="Location-based service">
<text>Location-based service (LBS) is a general term denoting software services which use geographic data and information to provide services or information to users. LBS can be used in a variety of contexts, such as health, indoor object search, entertainment, work, personal life, etc. Commonly used examples of location-based services include navigation software, social networking services, location-based advertising, and tracking systems. LBS can also include mobile commerce when taking the form of coupons or advertising directed at customers based on their current location. LBS also includes personalized weather services and even location-based games.

LBS is critical to many businesses as well as government organizations to drive real insight from data tied to a specific location where activities take place. The spatial patterns that location-related data and services can provide is one of its most powerful and useful aspects where location is a common denominator in all of these activities and can be leveraged to better understand patterns and relationships. Banking, surveillance, online commerce, and many weapon systems are dependent on LBS.

Access policies are controlled by location data or time-of-day constraints, or a combination thereof. As such, an LBS is an information service and has a number of uses in social networking today as information, in entertainment or security, which is accessible with mobile devices through the mobile network and which uses information on the geographical position of the mobile device.

This concept of location-based systems is not compliant with the standardized concept of real-time locating systems (RTLS) and related local services, as noted in ISO/IEC 19762-5 and ISO/IEC 24730-1. While networked computing devices generally do very well to inform consumers of days old data, the computing devices themselves can also be tracked, even in real-time. LBS privacy issues arise in that context, and are documented below.

==History==
Location-based services (LBSs) are widely used in many computer systems and applications. Modern location-based services are made possible by technological developments such as the World Wide Web, satellite navigation systems, and the widespread use of mobile phones.

Location-based services were developed by integrating data from satellite navigation systems, cellular networks, and mobile computing, to provide services based on the geographical locations of users. Over their history, location-based software has evolved from simple synchronization-based service models to authenticated and complex tools for implementing virtually any location-based service model or facility.

There is currently no agreed upon criteria for defining the market size of location-based services, but the European GNSS Agency estimated that 40% of all computer applications used location-based software as of 2013, and 30% of all Internet searches were for locations.

LBS is the ability to open and close specific data objects based on the use of location or time (or both) as controls and triggers or as part of complex cryptographic key or hashing systems and the data they provide access to. Location-based services may be one of the most heavily used application-layer decision framework in computing.

The Global Positioning System was first developed by the United States Department of Defense in the 1970s, and was made available for worldwide use and use by civilians in the 1980s. Research forerunners of today&#x27;s location-based services include the infrared Active Badge system (1989–1993), the Ericsson-Europolitan GSM LBS trial by Jörgen Johansson (1995), and the master thesis written by Nokia employee Timo Rantalainen in 1995.

In 1990 International Teletrac Systems (later PacTel Teletrac), founded in Los Angeles CA, introduced the world&#x27;s first dynamic real-time stolen vehicle recovery services. As an adjacency to this they began developing location-based services that could transmit information about location-based goods and services to custom-programmed alphanumeric Motorola pagers. In 1996 the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued rules requiring all US mobile operators to locate emergency callers. This rule was a compromise resulting from US mobile operators seeking the support of the emergency community in order to obtain the same protection from lawsuits relating to emergency calls as fixed-line operators already had.

In 1997 Christopher Kingdon, of Ericsson, handed in the Location Services (LCS) stage 1 description to the joint GSM group of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). As a result, the LCS sub-working group was created under ANSI T1P1.5. This group went on to select positioning methods and standardize Location Services (LCS), later known as Location Based Services (LBS). Nodes defined include the Gateway Mobile Location Centre (GMLC), the Serving Mobile Location Centre (SMLC) and concepts such as Mobile Originating Location Request (MO-LR), Network Induced Location Request (NI-LR) and Mobile Terminating Location Request (MT-LR).

As a result of these efforts in 1999 the first digital location-based service patent was filed in the US and ultimately issued after nine office actions in March 2002. The patent has controls which when applied to today&#x27;s networking models provide key value in all systems.

In 2000, after approval from the world’s twelve largest telecom operators, Ericsson, Motorola and Nokia jointly formed and launched the Location Interoperability Forum Ltd (LIF). This forum first specified the Mobile Location Protocol (MLP), an interface between the telecom network and an LBS application running on a server in the Internet domain. Then, much driven by the Vodafone group, LIF went on to specify the Location Enabling Server (LES), a &quot;middleware&quot;, which simplifies the integration of multiple LBS with an operators infrastructure. In 2004 LIF was merged with the Open Mobile Association (OMA). An LBS work group was formed within the OMA.

In 2002, Marex.com in Miami Florida designed the world first marine asset telemetry device for commercial sale. The device, designed by Marex and engineered by its partner firms in telecom and hardware, was capable of transmitting location data and retrieving location-based service data via both cellular and satellite-based communications channels. Utilizing the Orbcomm satellite network, the device had multi level SOS features for both MAYDAY and marine assistance, vessel system condition and performance monitoring with remote notification, and a dedicated hardware device similar to GPS units. Based upon the device location, it was capable of providing detailed bearing, distance and communication information to the vessel operator in real time, in addition to the marine assistance and MAYDAY features. The concept and functionality was coined &quot;Location Based Services&quot; by the principal architect and product manager for Marex, Jason Manowitz, SVP, Product and Strategy. The device was branded as &quot;Integrated Marine Asset Management System&quot; (&quot;IMAMS&quot;), and the proof-of-concept beta device was demonstrated to various US government agencies for vessel identification, tracking, and enforcement operations in addition to the commercial product line. The device was capable of tracking assets including ships, planes, shipping containers, or any other mobile asset with a proper power source and antenna placement. Marex&#x27;s financial challenges were unable to support product introduction and the beta device disappeared.

The first consumer LBS-capable mobile Web device was the Palm VII, released in 1999. Two of the in-the-box applications made use of the ZIP-code–level positioning information and share the title for first consumer LBS application: the Weather.com app from The Weather Channel, and the TrafficTouch app from Sony-Etak / Metro Traffic.

The first LBS services were launched during 2001 by TeliaSonera in Sweden (FriendFinder, yellow pages, houseposition, emergency call location etc.) and by EMT in Estonia (emergency call location, friend finder, TV game). TeliaSonera and EMT based their services on the Ericsson Mobile Positioning System (MPS).

Other early LBSs include friendzone, launched by swisscom in Switzerland in May 2001, using the technology of valis ltd. The service included friend finder, LBS dating and LBS games. The same service was launched later by Vodafone Germany, Orange Portugal and Pelephone in Israel. Microsoft&#x27;s Wi-Fi-based indoor location system RADAR (2000), MIT&#x27;s Cricket project using ultrasound location (2000) and Intel&#x27;s Place Lab with wide-area location (2003).

In May 2002, go2 and AT&amp;T Mobility launched the first (US) mobile LBS local search application that used Automatic Location Identification (ALI) technologies mandated by the FCC. go2 users were able to use AT&amp;T&#x27;s ALI to determine their location and search near that location to obtain a list of requested locations (stores, restaurants, etc.) ranked by proximity to the ALI provide by the AT&amp;T wireless network. The ALI determined location was also used as a starting point for turn-by-turn directions.

The main advantage is that mobile users do not have to manually specify postal codes or other location identifiers to use LBS, when they roam into a different location.

==Location industry==
There are various companies that sell access to an individual&#x27;s location history and this is estimated to be a $12 billion industry composed of collectors, aggregators and marketplaces. As of 2021, a company named Near claimed to have data from 1.6 billion people in 44 different countries, Mobilewalla claims data on 1.9 billion devices, and X-Mode claims to have a database of 25 percent of the U.S. adult population. An analysis, conducted by the non-profit newsroom called The Markup, found six out of 47 companies who claimed over a billion devices in their database. As of 2021, there are no rules or laws governing who can buy an individual&#x27;s data.

==Locating methods==
There are a number of ways in which the location of an object, such as a mobile phone or device, can be determined. Another emerging method for confirming location is IoT and blockchain-based relative object location verification.

===Control plane locating===
With control plane locating, sometimes referred to as positioning, the mobile phone service provider gets the location based on the radio signal delay of the closest cell-phone towers (for phones without satellite navigation features) which can be quite slow as it uses the &#x27;voice control&#x27; channel. In the UK, networks do not use trilateration; Because LBS services use a single base station, with a &quot;radius&quot; of inaccuracy, to determine a phone&#x27;s location. This technique was the basis of the E-911 mandate and is still used to locate cellphones as a safety measure. Newer phones and PDAs typically have an integrated A-GPS chip.

In addition there are emerging techniques like Real Time Kinematics and WiFi RTT (Round Trip Timing) as part of Precision Time Management services in WiFi and related protocols.

In order to provide a successful LBS technology the following factors must be met:
* coordinates accuracy requirements that are determined by the relevant service,
* lowest possible cost,
* minimal impact on network and equipment.

Several categories of methods can be used to find the location of the subscriber. The simple and standard solution is LBS based on a satellite navigation system such as Galileo or GPS. Sony Ericsson&#x27;s &quot;NearMe&quot; is one such example; it is used to maintain knowledge of the exact location. Satellite navigation is based on the concept of trilateration, a basic geometric principle that allows finding one location if one knows its distance from other, already known locations.

=== Self-reported positioning ===

A low cost alternative to using location technology to track the player, is to not track at all. This has been referred to as &quot;self-reported positioning&quot;. It was used in the mixed reality game called Uncle Roy All Around You in 2003 and considered for use in the Augmented reality games in 2006. Instead of tracking technologies, players were given a map which they could pan around and subsequently mark their location upon. With the rise of location-based networking, this is more commonly known as a user &quot;check-in&quot;.

===Other===
Near LBS (NLBS) involves local-range technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy, wireless LAN, infrared or near-field communication technologies, which are used to match devices to nearby services. This application allows a person to access information based on their surroundings; especially suitable for using inside closed premises, restricted or regional area.
Another alternative is an operator- and satellite-independent location service based on access into the deep level telecoms network (SS7). This solution enables accurate and quick determination of geographical coordinates of mobile phones by providing operator-independent location data and works also for handsets that do not have satellite navigation capability.

In addition, the IP address could provide the end-user&#x27;s location.

Many other local positioning systems and indoor positioning systems are available, especially for indoor use. GPS and GSM do not work very well indoors, so other techniques are used, including co-pilot beacon for CDMA networks, Bluetooth, UWB, RFID and Wi-Fi.

==Applications==
Location-based services may be employed in a number of applications, including:
* recommending social events in a city
* requesting the nearest business or service, such as an ATM, restaurant or a retail store
* turn-by-turn navigation to any address
* assistive healthcare systems
* locating people on a map displayed on the mobile phone
* receiving alerts, such as notification of a sale on gas or warning of a traffic jam
* location-based mobile advertising
* asset recovery combined with active RF to find, for example, stolen assets in containers where GPS would not work
* contextualizing learning and research
* games where your location is part of the game play, for example your movements during your day make your avatar move in the game or your position unlocks content.
* real-time Q&amp;A revolving around restaurants, services, and other venues.
* tracking a NASA lunar lander.
* sending a mobile caller&#x27;s location during an emergency call using Advanced Mobile Location

For the carrier, location-based services provide added value by enabling services such as:
* &quot;Resource tracking with dynamic distribution&quot;. Taxis, service people, rental equipment, doctors, fleet scheduling.
* &quot;Resource tracking&quot;. Objects without privacy controls, using passive sensors or RF tags, such as packages and train boxcars.
* &quot;Finding someone or something&quot;. Person by skill (doctor), business directory, navigation, weather, traffic, room schedules, stolen phone, emergency calls.
* &quot;Proximity-based notification (push or pull)&quot;. Targeted advertising, buddy list, common profile matching (dating).
* &quot;Proximity-based actuation (push or pull)&quot;. Payment based upon proximity (EZ pass, toll watch), automatic airport check-in.

In the U.S. the FCC requires that all carriers meet certain criteria for supporting location-based services (FCC 94–102). The mandate requires 95% of handsets to resolve within 300 meters for network-based tracking (e.g. triangulation) and 150 meters for handset-based tracking (e.g. GPS). This can be especially useful when dialing an emergency telephone number – such as enhanced 9-1-1 in North America, or 112 in Europe – so that the operator can dispatch emergency services such as emergency medical services, police or firefighters to the correct location. CDMA and iDEN operators have chosen to use GPS location technology for locating emergency callers. This led to rapidly increasing penetration of GPS in iDEN and CDMA handsets in North America and other parts of the world where CDMA is widely deployed. Even though no such rules are yet in place in Japan or in Europe the number of GPS-enabled GSM/WCDMA handset models is growing fast. According to the independent wireless analyst firm Berg Insight the attach rate for GPS is growing rapidly in GSM/WCDMA handsets, from less than 8% in 2008 to 15% in 2009.

As for economic impact, location-based services are estimated to have a $1.6 Trillion impact on the US economy alone.

European operators are mainly using Cell ID for locating subscribers. This is also a method used in Europe by companies that are using cell-based LBS as part of systems to recover stolen assets. In the US companies such as Rave Wireless in New York are using GPS and triangulation to enable college students to notify campus police when they are in trouble.

===Comparison of location tracking apps for mobile devices===
Currently there are roughly three different models for location-based apps on mobile devices. All share that they allow one&#x27;s location to be tracked by others. Each functions in the same way at a high level, but with differing functions and features. Below is a comparison of an example application from each of the three models.
==Mobile messaging==
Mobile messaging plays an essential role in LBS. Messaging, especially SMS, has been used in combination with various LBS applications, such as location-based mobile advertising.
SMS is still the main technology carrying mobile advertising / marketing campaigns to mobile phones. A classic example of LBS applications using SMS is the delivery of mobile coupons or discounts to mobile subscribers who are near to advertising restaurants, cafes, movie theatres. The Singaporean mobile operator MobileOne carried out such an initiative in 2007 that involved many local marketers, what was reported to be a huge success in terms of subscriber acceptance.

==Privacy issues==
The Location Privacy Protection Act of 2012 (S.1223) was introduced by Senator Al Franken (D-MN) in order to regulate the transmission and sharing of user location data in the United States. It is based on the individual&#x27;s one time consent to participate in these services (Opt In). The bill specifies the collecting entities, the collectable data and its usage. The bill does not specify, however, the period of time that the data collecting entity can hold on to the user data (a limit of 24 hours seems appropriate since most of the services use the data for immediate searches, communications, etc.), and the bill does not include location data stored locally on the device (the user should be able to delete the contents of the location data document periodically just as he would delete a log document). The bill which was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee, would also require mobile services to disclose the names of the advertising networks or other third parties with which they share consumers&#x27; locations.

With the passing of the CAN-SPAM Act in 2003, it became illegal in the United States to send any message to the end user without the end user specifically opting-in. This put an additional challenge on LBS applications as far as &quot;carrier-centric&quot; services were concerned. As a result, there has been a focus on user-centric location-based services and applications which give the user control of the experience, typically by opting in first via a website or mobile interface (such as SMS, mobile Web, and Java/BREW applications).

The European Union also provides a legal framework for data protection that may be applied for location-based services, and more particularly several European directives such as: (1) Personal data: Directive 95/46/EC; (2) Personal data in electronic communications: Directive 2002/58/EC; (3) Data Retention: Directive 2006/24/EC. However the applicability of legal provisions to varying forms of LBS and of processing location data is unclear.

One implication of this technology is that data about a subscriber&#x27;s location and historical movements is owned and controlled by the network operators, including mobile carriers and mobile content providers. Mobile content providers and app developers are a concern. Indeed, a 2013 MIT study by de Montjoye et al. showed that 4 spatio-temporal points, approximate places and times, are enough to uniquely identify 95% of 1.5M people in a mobility database. The study further shows that these constraints hold even when the resolution of the dataset is low. Therefore, even coarse or blurred datasets provide little anonymity. A critical article by Dobson and Fisher discusses the possibilities for misuse of location information.

Beside the legal framework there exist several technical approaches to protect privacy using privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs). Such PETs range from simplistic on/off switches to sophisticated PETs using anonymization techniques (e.g. providing k-anonymity), or cryptograpic protocols. Only few LBS offer such PETs, e.g., Google Latitude offered an on/off switch and allows to stick one&#x27;s position to a free definable location. Additionally, it is an open question how users perceive and trust in different PETs. The only study that addresses user perception of state of the art PETs is. Another set of techniques included in the PETs are the location obfuscation techniques, which slightly alter the location of the users in order to hide their real location while still being able to represent their position and receive services from their LBS provider.

Recent research has shown that crowdsourcing is also an effective approach at locating lost objects while still upholding the privacy of users. This is done by ensuring a limited level of interactions between users.

<text>The Belmont Stakes is an American Grade I stakes race for three-year-old Thoroughbreds run at Belmont Park in Elmont, New York. It is run over the worldwide classic distance of . Colts and geldings carry a weight of ; fillies carry . The race, nicknamed The Test of the Champion, The Test of Champions and The Run for the Carnations, is the traditional third and final leg of the Triple Crown. It is usually held on the first or second Saturday in June, five weeks after the Kentucky Derby and three weeks after the Preakness Stakes. The 1973 Belmont Stakes and Triple Crown winner Secretariat holds the track record (which is also a world record on dirt) of 2:24.

The race covers one full lap of Belmont Park, known as &quot;The Championship Track&quot; because nearly every major American champion in racing history has competed on the racetrack. Belmont Park, with its large, wide, sweeping turns and long homestretch, is considered one of the fairest racetracks in America. Despite the distance, the race tends to favor horses with tactical speed: relatively few winners close from far behind the early leaders.

The attendance at the Belmont Stakes is among the American thoroughbred racing top-attended events. The 2004 Belmont Stakes drew a television audience of 21.9 million viewers, and had the highest household viewing rate since 1977 when Seattle Slew won the Triple Crown.

Justify won the 150th Belmont Stakes in 2018 to become the 13th Triple Crown champion.

== History ==

=== 1867–1929: early years ===

The first Belmont Stakes was held at Jerome Park Racetrack in the Bronx, built in 1866 by stock market speculator Leonard Jerome (1817–1891) and financed by August Belmont Sr. (1816–1890), for whom the race was named. The first race in 1867 saw the filly Ruthless win, while the following year was won by General Duke. The first post parade in the United States was at the 14th Belmont, in 1880. The race continued to be held at Jerome Park until 1890, when it was moved to the nearby facility, Morris Park Racecourse. The 1895 race was almost not held because of new laws that banned bookmaking in New York: it was eventually rescheduled for November 2. The race remained at Morris Park Racecourse until the May 1905 opening of the new Belmont Park, racetrack in Elmont, New York, on Long Island, just outside the New York City borough of Queens. When anti-gambling legislation was passed in New York State, Belmont Racetrack was closed, and the race was cancelled in 1911 and 1912. 

The first winner of the Triple Crown was Sir Barton, in 1919, before the series was recognized as such. In 1920, the Belmont was won by the great Man o&#x27; War, who won by 20 lengths, setting a new stakes and American record, while under a stout pull.

Starting in 1926, the winner of the Belmont Stakes has been presented with August Belmont Trophy. The owner may keep the trophy for one year, and also receives a silver miniature for permanent use.

=== 1930–2000: evolution of the Triple Crown series ===
The term Triple Crown was first used when Gallant Fox won the three races in 1930, but the term did not enter widespread use until 1935 when his son Omaha repeated the feat. Sir Barton was then honored retroactively. Since 1931, the order of Triple Crown races has been the Kentucky Derby first, followed by the Preakness Stakes, and then the Belmont Stakes. Prior to 1931, the Preakness was run before the Derby eleven times. On May 12, 1917, and again on May 13, 1922, the Preakness and the Derby were run on the same day. On eleven occasions, the Belmont Stakes was run before the Preakness Stakes. The date of each event is now set by the Kentucky Derby, which is always held on the first Saturday in May. The Preakness Stakes is currently held two weeks later; and the Belmont Stakes is held three weeks after the Preakness (five weeks after the Derby). The earliest possible date for the Derby is May 1, and the latest is May 7; the earliest possible date for the Belmont is thus June 5, and the latest is June 11. In 2020, due to the cancellation of the original dates due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the order changed with the Belmont first on June 20, the Kentucky Derby on September 5 and the Preakness on October 3—all with no spectators—before the Triple Crown races resumed their normal schedule in 2021.
In 1937, War Admiral became the fourth Triple Crown winner after winning the Belmont in a new track record time of 2:28 3/5. In the 1940s, four Triple Crown winners followed: Whirlaway in 1941, Count Fleet in 1943, Assault in 1946 and Citation in 1948. Count Fleet won the race by a then-record margin of twenty-five lengths. He also set a stakes record of 2:28 1/5, a record tied by Citation. In 1957, the stakes record was smashed when Gallant Man ran the Belmont in 2:26 3/5 in a year when the Triple Crown series was split three ways.

The Belmont Stakes race was held at Aqueduct Racetrack from 1963 to 1967, while the track at Belmont was restored and renovated.

The largest crowd of the 20th century was in 1971 with over 80,000 people, supplemented by the city&#x27;s Latino community, there to cheer on their new hero, Cañonero II, the Venezuelan colt who had won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes and was poised to win the U.S. Triple Crown. However, due to a foot infection that had bothered the horse for several days, Cañonero II failed to win the Triple Crown when he struggled across the finish line in 4th place behind Pass Catcher, ridden by Walter Blum. Despite this loss, Cañonero II was named the winner of the first Eclipse Award for Outstanding Three-Year-Old Male Horse.

On June 9, 1973, Secretariat won the Belmont Stakes by thirty-one lengths in a record time of 2:24, becoming a Triple Crown champion, ending a 25-year gap between Citation, the Belmont and Triple Crown winner in 1948. Secretariat&#x27;s record still stands as the fastest running of the Belmont Stakes and an American record for miles on the dirt. In 1977, Seattle Slew became the first horse to win the Triple Crown while undefeated. Affirmed was the last winner of the Triple Crown in the 20th century, taking the Belmont Stakes in 2:26 4/5 on June 10, 1978. Ridden by eighteen-year-old Steve Cauthen, Affirmed defeated rival Alydar with Jorge Velásquez in the saddle. At the time the race was the third-slowest start and the third-fastest finish with the quarter in 25, the half in 50, 3/4 in 1:14, the mile in 1:37 2/5.

In 1988, Secretariat&#x27;s son Risen Star won the Belmont in 2:26 2/5, then the second-fastest time in the history of the race. The next year, Easy Goer lowered the mark for second-fastest time to 2:26. Easy Goer also holds a Beyer Speed Figure of 122 for the race, the best of any Triple Crown race since these ratings were first published in 1987.

=== 2001–present: recent years ===

For three years in a row, horses came to the Belmont Stakes with a Triple Crown on the line only to fail. In 2002, Belmont Park hosted what was then the largest crowd in its history when 103,222 saw War Emblem lose to longshot Sarava after stumbling at the start. In 2003, 101,864 watched Funny Cide finish third behind Empire Maker. In 2004, the attendance record was shattered when 120,139 people saw Smarty Jones upset by Birdstone.

In 2007, Rags to Riches became the first filly to win the race since Tanya in 1905. Three more failed Triple Crown bids followed: in 2008, Big Brown lost to Da&#x27; Tara; in 2012, I&#x27;ll Have Another was withdrawn due to injury; and in 2014, California Chrome was beaten by Tonalist. This fueled debate about whether the series needed to be changed, for example by lengthening the period between races.

American Pharoah won the 2015 race, becoming the 12th horse in history to win the Triple Crown and the first in 37 years. The crowd that year was limited for the first time, to 90,000. His time of 2:26.65 was the sixth-fastest in Belmont Stakes history, and the second-fastest time for a Triple Crown winner. In 2018, Justify became the 13th Triple Crown winner and only the second horse to do so while undefeated.

The 152nd running of the Belmont Stakes took place without in-person fans on June 20, 2020, delayed from June 6 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Leading to the announcement, NYRA considered various dates after evaluating the spring-summer meeting at Belmont Park and after the other three majors set their respective dates: the Kentucky Derby moving to September 5, the Preakness Stakes moving to October 3, and the Breeders&#x27; Cup Classic slated for November 7. Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York announced on May 16 that horse racing tracks statewide, including Belmont Park, would be permitted to resume races without in-person fans on June 1. The 2020 contest also marked the first time in history that the Belmont Stakes served as the Triple Crown&#x27;s opening leg, with its running length shortened accordingly to , its shortest distance since 1894.

The 154th running of the Belmont Stakes was held on Saturday, June 11, 2022. Mo Donegal won with a time of 2:28.28. Principal owner was Jerry Crawford. Mo Donegal was trained by Todd Pletcher and ridden by Irad Ortiz Jr.

====Temporary move to Saratoga====
On December 6, 2023, New York State Governor Kathy Hochul announced that the 2024 Belmont Stakes would be held on Saturday, June 8 at Saratoga Race Course because of ongoing construction and renovations at Belmont Park. The purse of the race will be increased to US$2 million and, pending approval of the American Graded Stakes Committee, it will be run at a shorter distance of instead of the usual due to the smaller size of the Saratoga dirt track.

In March 2024 the New York Racing Association announced that the 2025 Belmont Stakes would also be moved to Saratoga, pending regulatory approval.

== Locations ==
Over the years the race has been held at the following racetracks:

* 1867-1889 - Jerome Park Racetrack (23 times)
* 1890-1904 - Morris Park Racecourse (15 times)
* 1905-1910 - 1st Belmont Park
* 1911-1912 - Not held due to Hart-Agnew Law
* 1913-1962 - 1st Belmont Park (56 times)
* 1963-1967 - Aqueduct (5 times)
* 1968-2023 - 2nd Belmont Park (56 times)
* 2024 - Saratoga Racecourse (1 time)

== Distance and race details ==
The Belmont Stakes has been run at a mile and a half from 1874 to 1889 and 1926 to the present. An exception was made in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the national racing schedule underwent significant changes. Additionally, the distance of the Belmont Stakes has been changed during the race&#x27;s temporary relocation to Saratoga in 2024 and 2025, pending regulatory approvals.

Besides miles, the Belmont has been run at the following distances: a mile and five furlongs in 1867–1873; a mile and a quarter in 1890–1892, 1895, 1904–1905, and 2024; a mile and a furlong in 1893–1894 and again in 2020; and a mile and three furlongs from 1896 to 1903 and 1906–1925.

The purse for the first running in 1867 was $1,500 added, meaning the purse was supplemented by nomination and entry fees. This made the total purse $2,500, with the winner receiving $1,850. The purse increased sharply in the Roaring Twenties, from Man O&#x27;War&#x27;s earnings of $7,950 in 1920 to Gallant Fox&#x27;s take of $66,040 in 1930. Purses declined as a result of the Great Depression, with War Admiral earning only $28,020 in 1937, then began to recover. Throughout the sixties and early seventies, the value to the winner was roughly $100,000, depending on the added money generated by entry fees (larger fields thus leading to higher prize money). The purse was repeatedly raised in the eighties and nineties, reaching $500,000 added, with the winner receiving roughly $400,000. In 1998, the purse was changed to $1,000,000 guaranteed, with the winner receiving $600,000. In 2014, the purse was raised to $1,500,000.

With one exception, the race has been run at a level weight of 126 pounds (with a 5-pound allowance for fillies) since 1900. The 126 pounds comes from the English Classics, where the standard weight is 9 stone, with one stone equaling 14 pounds. In 1913, the Belmont was run as a handicap with the winner carrying only 109 pounds compared to the runner-up carrying 126 pounds. Races run prior to 1900 had varied weight conditions.

The first post parade in the United States was at the 14th Belmont, in 1880. Before 1921, the race was run in the clockwise tradition of English racing. Since then, the race has been run in the American, or counter-clockwise, direction.

== Traditions ==

The Belmont Stakes is traditionally called &quot;The Test of the Champion&quot; because it is by far the longest of the Triple Crown races (1.5 miles–a full lap around the enormous Belmont main track). It is also one of the longest first-class races on dirt in the United States. Most three-year-olds are unaccustomed to the distance, and lack the experience, if not the stamina, to maintain a winning speed for so long. In a long race such as the Belmont, positioning of the horse and the timing of the move to chase for the lead can be critical.

It is also known as &quot;The Run for the Carnations&quot; because the winning horse is draped with a blanket of white carnations after the race, in similar fashion to the blanket of roses and black-eyed Susans for the Derby and Preakness, respectively. 

=== Trophy ===
The winning owner is ceremonially presented with the silver winner&#x27;s trophy, designed by Paulding Farnham for Tiffany and Co. It was first presented to August Belmont Jr. in 1896 and donated by the Belmont family for annual presentation in 1926.

=== Official song ===
Despite the fact that the Belmont Stakes is the oldest of the Triple Crown races, its traditions have been more subject to change. Until 1996, the post parade song was &quot;The Sidewalks of New York&quot;. From 1997 to 2009, the song was changed to a recording by Frank Sinatra of the &quot;Theme from &quot;New York, New York&quot;&quot; in an attempt to appeal to younger fans. In 2010, the song was changed to Jay-Z&#x27;s &quot;Empire State of Mind&quot; sung by Jasmine V before reverting to &quot;Theme from &quot;New York, New York&quot;&quot; from 2011 through the present. This tradition is similar to the singing of the state song at the post parades of the first two Triple Crown races: &quot;My Old Kentucky Home&quot; at the Kentucky Derby and &quot;Maryland, My Maryland&quot; at the Preakness Stakes. The change of song gave rise to &quot;the myth of Mamie O&#x27;Rourke&quot;, a reference to a character in the lyrics of &quot;The Sidewalks of New York.&quot; Before American Pharoah won the Triple Crown in 2015, some claimed that changing the official Belmont song &quot;cursed&quot; the Triple Crown and was why no horse had won since Affirmed in 1978. Others note that there was no Triple Crown winner between 1979 and 1996, even though &quot;Sidewalks&quot; was still played.

=== Official drink ===
Along with the change of song in 1997, the official drink was also changed, from the &quot;White Carnation&quot; to the &quot;Belmont Breeze.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewed both cocktails unfavorably, calling the Belmont Breeze &quot;a significant improvement over the nigh undrinkable White Carnation&quot; despite the fact that it &quot;tastes like a refined trashcan punch&quot;. In 2011, the Belmont Breeze was again changed to the current official drink known as the &quot;Belmont Jewel.&quot;

While the origin of the white carnation as the official flower of the Belmont Stakes is unknown, traditionally, pure white carnations stand for love and luck. It takes approximately 700 &quot;select&quot; carnations imported from Colombia to create the 40-pound blanket draped over the winner of the Belmont Stakes. The NYRA has long used The Pennock Company, a wholesale florist based in Philadelphia to import the carnations used for the mantle.

== Trivia ==
* Only James G. Rowe Sr. and George M. Odom have won the Belmont Stakes as both jockey and trainer.
* On June 5, 1993, thoroughbred racing&#x27;s all-time leading female jockey, Julie Krone, became the first woman to win a Triple Crown race when she rode to victory in the Belmont Stakes aboard Colonial Affair.
* In 1984, Sarah Lundy became the first female trainer to saddle a horse in the Belmont Stakes, sending out Minstrel Star, who finished eleventh.
* The 2004 race had the biggest attendance in the park&#x27;s history with 120,139.
* Sarava, at odds of 70–1, upset War Emblem&#x27;s bid for the Triple Crown.
* Braulio Baeza has the distinction of winning three Belmont Stakes over three different surfaces. He won in his Belmont Stakes debut on 65 to 1 long-shot Sherluck in 1961 at the old Belmont Park, won in 1963 on Chateaugay when the race was run at Aqueduct, and won in 1969 on Arts and Letters at the new Belmont Park.
* Prior to the 2016 running, bay horses had the most victories with 56. Chestnuts were close behind with 54 wins, followed by 33 dark bay/browns. Only three gray/roan horses had won (Belmar in 1895, Native Dancer in 1953, and High Echelon in 1970). In 2016, gray horses swept the top three positions.
* Fifteen Belmont Stakes winners have sired at least one Belmont winner. Leading this list is Man o&#x27; War, who sired three subsequent winners — American Flag, Crusader and Triple Crown winner War Admiral.
* Twenty-three horses missed their chance at a Triple Crown by not winning the Belmont. Eight of these finished second: Pensive (1944), Tim Tam (1958), Forward Pass (1968), Majestic Prince (1969), Sunday Silence (1989), Silver Charm (1997), Real Quiet (1998), and Smarty Jones (2004). Five finished third: Northern Dancer (1964), Spectacular Bid (1979), Pleasant Colony (1981), Charismatic (1999), and Funny Cide (2003). Four finished fourth: Kauai King (1966), Canonero II (1971), Alysheba (1987), and California Chrome (2014). Carry Back (1961) finished seventh, War Emblem (2002) finished eighth and Big Brown (2008) did not finish. Finally, three Derby/Preakness winners did not race in the Belmont: Burgoo King (1932), Bold Venture (1936) and I&#x27;ll Have Another (2012), though I&#x27;ll Have Another was injured and was scratched the day before his Belmont Stakes in 2012.
* In June 1971, mentalist The Amazing Kreskin predicted that the winner of the next Belmont Stakes &quot;would have an S in the third or fourth letter of his name.&quot; The winning horse that year was Pass Catcher.
* On June 10, 2023, Jena M. Antonucci became the first woman to train a winner of an American Triple Crown race, having conditioned Arcangelo to victory in the 2023 Belmont Stakes.

== Fillies in the Belmont ==
Only 24 fillies have run in the Belmont; three of which have won:
* 1867 – Ruthless
* 1905 – Tanya
* 2007 – Rags to Riches

This gives them a respectable 13% win rate when entered. For context, three fillies have won the Kentucky Derby while six have won the Preakness Stakes. On average, fillies have won between 2% and 3% of the Triple Crown races, with similar numbers for geldings; while about 95% of these races have been won by colts. The last filly as of June 11, 2022 to run in the Belmont was in 2022 when Nest ran second (placed) behind the winner her stable mate Mo Donegal.

== Foreign-born winners ==
* 1874 – Saxon 
* 1898 – Bowling Brook 
* 1917 – Hourless 
* 1918 – Johren 
* 1957 – Gallant Man 
* 1958 – Cavan 
* 1960 – Celtic Ash 
* 1990 – Go And Go 
* 1998 – Victory Gallop 

== Winners (since 1867) ==
Triple Crown winners are in bold.

* Note: Timed to the second 1867 to 1901 and 1903, and to the second in 1902 and from 1904 to 1991. Decimal timing, to the nearest , is now used, though race calls and many charts still use fifths.
A † designates a filly.

== Sire lines ==

* the Darley Arabian (1700c) sire line (all branched through the Eclipse (1764) line) produced 124 Stakes winners (119 colts, 2 geldings, 3 fillies), including all winners from 2009 to present. The main branches of this sire line are:

<text>The Kentucky Oaks is a Grade I stakes race for three-year-old Thoroughbred fillies staged annually in Louisville, Kentucky, United States. The race currently covers at Churchill Downs; the horses carry . The Kentucky Oaks is held on the Friday before the Kentucky Derby each year. The winner gets $846,300 of the $1,500,000 purse, and a large garland blanket of lilies, resulting in the nickname &quot;Lilies for the Fillies.&quot; A silver Kentucky Oaks Trophy is presented to the winner.

==History==
The first running of the Kentucky Oaks was on May 19, 1875, when Churchill Downs was known as the Louisville Jockey Club. The race was founded by Meriwether Lewis Clark Jr. along with the Kentucky Derby, the Clark Handicap, and the Falls City Handicap.

The Kentucky Oaks and the Kentucky Derby are the oldest continuously contested sporting events in American history. The Kentucky Oaks was modeled after the British Epsom Oaks, which has been run annually at Epsom Downs, Epsom, in Surrey since 1779. In the first race, the horse Vinaigrette won the then mile race in a time of 2:, winning a purse of $1,175. Since that race, the Kentucky Oaks has been held each year.

In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Kentucky Oaks was rescheduled from May 1 to September 4.

The Kentucky Oaks is considered by some to be among the most popular horse races in American horse-racing society due to its high attendance. It has attracted about 100,000 people in attendance each year since 2001&#x27;s 127th running of the Kentucky Oaks. In 1980, attendance reached about 50,000 people and by 1989, it had increased to about 67,000. The attendance at the Kentucky Oaks ranks third in North America and usually surpasses the attendance of all other stakes races including the Belmont Stakes and the Breeders&#x27; Cup. The attendance of the Kentucky Oaks typically trails only the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness Stakes; for more information see American thoroughbred racing top attended events.

The Kentucky Oaks, the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes, and the Acorn Stakes are the counterparts to the Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing, held at Churchill Downs, Pimlico Race Course and Belmont Park, respectively. The &quot;Filly Triple Crown&quot;, known as the Triple Tiara of Thoroughbred Racing, is a series of three races at the Belmont Park and Saratoga Race Course. The National Thoroughbred Racing Association (NTRA) has considered changing the Triple Tiara series to the three counterparts of the Triple Crown.

==Charitable initiative==
On Kentucky Oaks Day, Churchill Downs Racetrack is a vision in pink as more than 100,000 guests are asked to incorporate pink into their attire in an effort to drive national attention to the fight against breast and ovarian cancer.

== Awards for winners ==
Besides the silver Kentucky Oaks Trophy presented to the winner, they are also presented with a Garland of Lilies draped around the filly&#x27;s withers.

The first garland for the Kentucky Oaks was presented to Kathleen, the 1916 winner. It was made of roses, not the lilies that have become synonymous with the filly&#x27;s race today. Though every Oaks winner since Kathleen has received a garland, the Star Gazer Lily did not become the official flower of the Kentucky Oaks until 1991, when the Kroger Company was commissioned to create a feminine garland for the fillies. Lite Light, winner of the 117th Kentucky Oaks, was the first filly to receive the garland of lilies.

The Star Gazer Lily was selected for its femininity and strength. A total of 133 lilies are sewn onto a white moire fabric backing with a fleur-de-lis pattern, which, like the green satin of the Derby garland, is embroidered in white-on-white with the seal of the Commonwealth of Kentucky at one end and an image of the Twin Spires and the words stating which running of the Kentucky Oaks it is on the opposite end. It is trimmed in a border of Oak Ivy Leaves symbolic of the event. The completed fabric is 116 inches long, 18 inches wide and weighs approximately 18 pounds. A bouquet of Star Gazer Lilies is also given to the jockey for the winner&#x27;s circle photo. Kroger is the official florist of the Kentucky Oaks and Derby. The public can view the lily garland at a local Kroger store the evening before the race.

<text>Secretariat (March 30, 1970 – October 4, 1989), also known as Big Red, was a champion American thoroughbred racehorse who was the ninth winner of the American Triple Crown, setting and still holding the fastest time record in all three of its constituent races. He is widely considered to be the greatest racehorse of all time. He became the first Triple Crown winner in 25 years and his record-breaking victory in the Belmont Stakes, which he won by 31 lengths, is often considered the greatest race ever run by a thoroughbred racehorse. During his racing career, he won five Eclipse Awards, including Horse of the Year honors at ages two and three. He was nominated to the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1974. In the &quot;Blood-Horse&quot; magazine List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century, Secretariat was second to Man o&#x27; War.

At age two, Secretariat finished fourth in his 1972 debut in a maiden race, but then won seven of his remaining eight starts, including five stakes victories. His only loss during this period was in the Champagne Stakes, where he finished first but was disqualified to second for interference. He received the Eclipse Award for champion two-year-old colt, and also was the 1972 Horse of the Year, a rare honor for a horse so young.

At age three, Secretariat not only won the Triple Crown, but also set speed records in all three races. His time in the Kentucky Derby still stands as the Churchill Downs track record for miles, and his time in the Belmont Stakes stands as the American record for miles on the dirt. In 2012, his actual time of 1:53 in the Preakness Stakes was recognized as a stakes record after an official review.

Secretariat&#x27;s win in the Gotham Stakes tied the track record for 1 mile, he set a world record in the Marlboro Cup at miles and further proved his versatility by winning two major stakes races on turf. He lost three times that year: in the Wood Memorial, Whitney, and Woodward Stakes, but the brilliance of his nine wins made him an American icon. He won his second Horse of the Year title, plus Eclipse Awards for champion three-year-old colt and champion turf horse.

At the beginning of his year as a three-year-old, Secretariat was syndicated for a record-breaking $6.08 million (equivalent to $ million in ), on the condition that he be retired from racing by the end of the year. Although he sired several successful racehorses, he ultimately was most influential through his daughters&#x27; offspring, becoming the leading broodmare sire in North America in 1992. His daughters produced several notable sires, including Storm Cat, A.P. Indy, Gone West, Dehere, Summer Squall, and Chief&#x27;s Crown, and through them Secretariat appears in the pedigree of many modern champions. Secretariat died in 1989 as a result of laminitis at age 19.

==Background==
Secretariat was officially bred by Christopher Chenery&#x27;s Meadow Stud, but the breeding was actually arranged by Penny Chenery (then known as Penny Tweedy), who had taken over the running of the stable in 1968 when her father became ill. Secretariat was sired by Bold Ruler and his dam was Somethingroyal, a daughter of Princequillo. Bold Ruler was the leading sire in North America from 1963 to 1969 and again in 1973. Owned by the Phipps family, Bold Ruler possessed both speed and stamina, having won the Preakness Stakes and Horse of the Year honors in 1957, and American Champion Sprint Horse honors in 1958. Bold Ruler was retired to stud at Claiborne Farm, but the Phipps family owned most of the mares to which Bold Ruler was bred, and few of his offspring were sold at public auction.

To bring new blood into their breeding program, the Phipps family sometimes negotiated a foal-sharing agreement with other mare owners: Instead of charging a stud fee for Bold Ruler, they would arrange for multiple matings with Bold Ruler, either with two mares in one year or one mare over a two-year period. Assuming two foals were produced, the Phipps family would keep one and the mare&#x27;s owner would keep the other, with a coin toss determining who received first pick.

Under such an arrangement, Chenery sent two mares to be bred to Bold Ruler in 1968, Hasty Matelda and Somethingroyal. She then sent Cicada and Somethingroyal in 1969. The foal-sharing agreement stated that the winner of the coin toss would get first pick of the foals produced in 1969, while the loser of the toss would get first pick of the foals due in 1970. In the spring of 1969, a colt and filly were produced. In the 1969 breeding season, Cicada did not conceive, leaving only one foal due in the spring of 1970. Thus, the winner of the coin toss would get only one foal (the first pick from 1969), and the loser would get two (the second pick from 1969 and the only foal from 1970). Chenery later said that both owners hoped they would lose the coin toss, which was held in the fall of 1969 in the office of New York Racing Association Chairman Alfred G. Vanderbilt II, with Arthur &quot;Bull&quot; Hancock of Claiborne Farm as witness. Ogden Phipps won the toss and took the 1969 weanling filly out of Somethingroyal. The filly was named The Bride and never won a race, though she did later become a stakes producer. Chenery received the Hasty Matelda colt in 1969 and the as-yet-unborn 1970 foal of Somethingroyal, which turned out to be Secretariat.

===Early years===
On March 30, 1970, at 12:10 a.m. at the Meadow Stud in Caroline County, Virginia, Somethingroyal foaled a bright-red chestnut colt with three white socks and a star with a narrow stripe. The foal stood when he was 45 minutes old and nursed 30 minutes later. Howard Gentry, the manager of Meadow Stud, was at the foaling and later said, &quot;He was a very well-made foal. He was as perfect a foal that I ever delivered.&quot; The colt soon distinguished himself from the others. &quot;He was always the leader in the crowd,&quot; said Gentry&#x27;s nephew, Robert, who also worked at the farm. &quot;To us, he was Big Red, and he had a personality. He was a clown and was always cutting up, always into some devilment.&quot; Some time later, Chenery got her first look at the foal and made a one-word entry in her notebook: &quot;Wow!&quot;

That fall, Chenery and Elizabeth Ham, the Meadow&#x27;s longtime secretary, worked together to name the newly weaned colt. The first set of names submitted to the Jockey Club (Sceptre, Royal Line, and Something Special) played on the names of his sire and dam, but were rejected. The second set, submitted in January 1971, were Games of Chance, Deo Volente (&quot;God Willing&quot;), and Secretariat, the last suggested by Ham based on her previous job associated with the secretariat of the League of Nations (the predecessor of the United Nations).

==Appearance and conformation==

Secretariat grew into a massive, powerful horse said to resemble his sire&#x27;s damsire, Discovery. He stood when fully grown. He was noted for being exceptionally well-balanced, described as having &quot;nearly perfect&quot; conformation and stride biomechanics. His chest was so large that he required a custom-made girth, and he was noted for his large, powerful, well-muscled hindquarters. An Australian trainer said of him, &quot;He is incredible, an absolutely perfect horse. I never saw anything like him.&quot;

Secretariat&#x27;s absence of major conformation flaws was important, as horses with well made limbs and feet are less likely to be injured. Secretariat&#x27;s hindquarters were the main source of his power, with a sloped croup that extended the length of his femur. When in full stride, his hind legs were able to reach far under himself, increasing his drive. His ample girth, long back and well-made neck all contributed to his heart-lung efficiency.

The manner in which Secretariat&#x27;s body parts fit together determined the efficiency of his stride, which affected his acceleration and endurance. Even very small differences in the length and angles of bones can have a major effect on performance. Secretariat was well put together even as a two-year-old, and by the time he was three, he had further matured in body and smoothed out his gait. The New York Racing Association&#x27;s Dr. M. A. Gilman, a veterinarian who routinely measured leading thoroughbreds with a goal of applying science to create better ways to breed and evaluate racehorses, measured Secretariat&#x27;s development from two to three as follows:

Secretariat&#x27;s length of stride was considered large even after taking into account his large frame and strong build. While training for the Preakness Stakes, his stride was measured as 24 feet, 11 inches. His powerful hindquarters allowed him to unleash &quot;devastating&quot; speed and because he was so well-muscled and had significant cardiac capacity, he could simply out-gallop competitors at nearly any point in a race.

His weight before the Gotham Stakes in April 1973 was . After completing the gruelling Triple Crown, his weight on June 15 had dropped only 24 pounds, to . Secretariat was known for his appetite — during his three-year-old campaign, he ate 15 quarts of oats a day — and to keep his muscles in good condition, he needed fast workouts that could have won many a stakes race.

Seth Hancock of Claiborne Farm once said,
==Racing career==

Secretariat raced in Meadow Stables&#x27; blue-and-white-checkered colors. He never raced in track bandages, but typically wore a blinker hood, mostly to help him focus, but also because he had a tendency to run in toward the rail during races. In January 1972, he joined trainer Lucien Laurin&#x27;s winter stable at Hialeah. Secretariat gained a reputation as a kind horse, likeable and unruffled in crowds or by the bumping that occurs between young horses. He had the physique of a runner but at first was awkward and clumsy. He was frequently outpaced by more precocious stable mates, running a quarter-mile in 26 seconds compared to 23 seconds by his peers. His regular exercise riders were Jim Gaffney and Charlie Davis. Davis was not initially impressed. &quot;He was a big fat sucker&quot;, Davis said. &quot;I mean, he was big. He wasn&#x27;t in a hurry to do nothin&#x27;. He took his time. The quality was there, but he didn&#x27;t show it until he wanted to.&quot; Gaffney though recalled his first ride on Secretariat in early 1972 as &quot;having this big red machine under me, and from that very first day I knew he had a power of strength that I have never felt before ...&quot;

Groom Eddie Sweat was another important member of the Secretariat team, providing most of the daily hands-on care. Sweat once told a reporter, &quot;I guess a groom gets closer to a horse than anyone. The owner, the trainer, they maybe see him once a day. But I lived with him, worked with him.&quot;

Laurin sent Chenery regular updates on Secretariat&#x27;s progress, saying that the colt was still learning to run, or that he still needed to lose his baby fat. Chenery recalled that when Secretariat was in training, Lucien once said: &quot;Your big Bold Ruler colt don&#x27;t show me nothin&#x27;. He can&#x27;t outrun a fat man.&quot; But Secretariat made steady progress over the spring. On June 6, he wore blinkers for the first time to keep his attention focused and responded with a half-mile workout in a solid 47 seconds. On June 24, he ran a &quot;bullet&quot;, the fastest workout of the day, at 6 furlongs in 1:12 on a sloppy track. Laurin called Chenery at her Colorado home and advised her that Secretariat was ready to race.

===1972: Two-year-old season===
For his first start on July 4, 1972, at Aqueduct Racetrack, Secretariat was made the lukewarm favorite at 3–1. At the start, a horse named Quebec cut in front of the field, causing a chain reaction that resulted in Secretariat being bumped hard. According to jockey Paul Feliciano, he would have fallen if he hadn&#x27;t been so strong. Secretariat recovered, only to run into traffic on the backstretch. In tenth position at the top of the stretch, he closed ground rapidly and finished fourth, beaten by only lengths. In many of his subsequent races, Secretariat hung back at the start, which Laurin later attributed to the bumping he received in his debut.

With Feliciano again up, Secretariat returned to the track on July 15 as the 6–5 favorite. He broke poorly, but then rushed past the field on the turn to win by six lengths. On July 31 in an allowance race at Saratoga, Feliciano was replaced by Ron Turcotte, the regular jockey for Meadow Stables. Turcotte had ridden the colt in several morning workouts but had missed his first two starts while recovering from a fall. Secretariat&#x27;s commanding win as the 2–5 favorite caught the attention of veteran sportswriter, Charles Hatton. He later reported, &quot;You carry an ideal around in your head, and boy, I thought, &#x27;This is it.&#x27; I never saw perfection before. I absolutely could not fault him in any way. And neither could the rest of them and that was the amazing thing about it. The body and the head and the eye and the general attitude. It was just incredible. I couldn&#x27;t believe my eyes, frankly.&quot;

In August, Secretariat entered the Sanford Stakes, facing off with highly regarded Linda&#x27;s Chief, the only horse ever to be favored against Secretariat in any of his races. Entering the stretch, Secretariat was blocked by the horses in front of him but then made his way through &quot;like a hawk scattering a barnyard of chickens&quot; on his way to a three-length win. Sportswriter Andrew Beyer covered the race for the &quot;Washington Star&quot; and later wrote, &quot;Never have I watched a lightly raced 2-year-old stamp himself so definitively as a potential great.&quot;

Ten days later in the Hopeful Stakes, Secretariat made a &quot;dazzling&quot; move, passing eight horses within mile to take the lead then drawing off to win by five lengths. His time of 1:16 for furlongs was only of a second off the track record. Returning to Belmont Park on September 16, he won the Belmont Futurity by a length and a half after starting his move on the turn. He then ran in the Champagne Stakes at Belmont on October 14 as the 7–10 favorite. As had become his custom, he started slowly and then made a big move around the turn, blowing past his rivals to win by two lengths. However, following an inquiry by the racecourse stewards, Secretariat was disqualified and placed second for bearing in and interfering with Stop the Music, who was declared the winner.

Secretariat then took the Laurel Futurity on October 28, winning by eight lengths over Stop the Music. His time on a sloppy track was just of a second off the track record. He completed his season in the Garden State Futurity on November 18, dropping back early and making a powerful move around the turn to win by lengths at 1–10 odds. Laurin said, &quot;In all his races, he has taken the worst of it by coming from behind, usually circling his field. A colt has to be a real runner to do this consistently and get away with it.&quot;

Secretariat won the Eclipse Award for American Champion Two-Year-Old Male Horse and, in a rare occurrence, two two-year-olds topped the balloting for 1972 American Horse of the Year honors, with Secretariat edging out the undefeated filly, La Prevoyante. Secretariat received the votes of the Thoroughbred Racing Associations of North America and the Daily Racing Form, while La Prevoyante was chosen by the National Turf Writers Association. Only one horse since then, Favorite Trick in 1997, has won that award as a two-year-old.

===1973: Three-year-old season===
In January 1973, Christopher Chenery, the founder of Meadow Stables, died and the taxes on his estate forced his daughter Penny to consider selling Secretariat. Together with of Claiborne Farm, she instead managed to syndicate the horse, selling 32 shares worth $190,000 each for a total of $6.08 million, a world syndication record at the time, surpassing the previous record for Nijinsky who was syndicated for $5.44 million in 1970. Hancock said the sale was easy, citing Secretariat&#x27;s two-year-old performance, breeding, and appearance. &quot;He&#x27;s, well, he&#x27;s a hell of a horse.&quot; Chenery retained four shares in the horse and would have complete control over his three-year-old racing campaign, but agreed that he would be retired at the end of the year.

Secretariat wintered in Florida but did not race until March 17, 1973, in the Bay Shore Stakes at Aqueduct, where he went off as the heavy favorite. As the trainer of one of his opponents put it, &quot;The only chance we have is if he falls down.&quot; Racing boxed in by horses on each side, Turcotte decided to go through a narrow gap between horses rather than try to circle the field. Secretariat broke free and won easily, but one of the other jockeys claimed that Secretariat had committed a foul going through the hole. The stewards reviewed photos from the race and determined that Secretariat was actually on the receiving end of a bump, so let the result stand. The Bay Shore established that Secretariat had improved over the winter and that he could also handle adversity.
In the Gotham Stakes on April 7, Laurin decided to experiment with Secretariat&#x27;s running style. With no speed horses entered in the race, Secretariat would be allowed to set his own pace. Accordingly, Turcotte hustled Secretariat from the starting gate and they led easily. Down the stretch though, Champagne Charlie came running and at the eighth pole was almost even. Turcotte tapped Secretariat once on each side with the whip and Secretariat drew away to win by three lengths. He ran the first 3/4 mile in 1:08 and finished the one-mile race in 1:33, matching the track record.

His final preparatory race for the Kentucky Derby was the Wood Memorial, where he finished a surprising third to Angle Light and Santa Anita Derby winner Sham. Laurin was crushed, even though he had trained the winner, Angle Light, who set a slow pace and &quot;stole&quot; the race. Secretariat&#x27;s loss was later attributed to a large abscess in his mouth, which made him sensitive to the bit. Before and after the race, there was some ill feeling between Laurin and the trainer of Sham, Pancho Martin, fanned by comments in the press. The dispute concerned the use of coupled entries as Martin had entered two horses in addition to Sham, all with the same owner. There was fear that an entry could be used tactically to gang up on another horse. Stung by such insinuations, Martin wound up scratching the two horses that he had originally entered with Sham, and asked Laurin to do the same, but Laurin could not follow suit as Secretariat and Angle Light had different owners.

Because of the Wood Memorial results, Secretariat&#x27;s chances in the Kentucky Derby became the subject of much speculation in the media. Some questioned his stamina: in part because of his &quot;blocky&quot; build, more typical of a sprinter, and in part because of Bold Ruler&#x27;s reputation as a sire of precocious sprinters. Rumors circulated that Secretariat was unsound.

====Kentucky Derby====
The 1973 Kentucky Derby on May 5 attracted a crowd of 134,476 to Churchill Downs, then the largest crowd in North American racing history. The bettors made the entry of Secretariat and Angle Light the 3–2 favorite, with Sham the second choice at 5–2. The start was marred when Twice a Prince reared in his stall, hitting Our Native, positioned next to him, and causing Sham to bang his head against the gate, loosening two teeth. Sham then broke poorly and cut himself, also bumping into Navajo. Secretariat avoided problems by breaking last from post position 10, then cut over to the rail. Early leader Shecky Greene set a reasonable pace, then gave way to Sham around the far turn. Secretariat came charging as they entered the stretch and battled with Sham down the stretch, finally pulling away to win by lengths. Our Native finished eight lengths farther back in third.

On his way to a still-standing track record of 1:59, Secretariat ran each quarter-mile segment faster than the one before it. The successive quarter-mile times were :25, :24, :23, :23, and :23. This means he was still accelerating as of the final quarter-mile of the race. No other horse had won the Derby in less than 2 minutes before, and it would not be accomplished again until Monarchos ran the race in 1:59.97 in 2001.

Sportswriter Mike Sullivan later said:
====Preakness Stakes====

In the 1973 Preakness Stakes on May 19, Secretariat broke last, but then made a huge, last-to-first move on the first turn. Raymond Woolfe, a photographer for the &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot;, captured Secretariat launching the move with a leaping stride in the air. This was later used as the basis for the statue by John Skeaping that stands in the Belmont Park paddock. Turcotte later said that he was proudest of this win because of the split-second decision he made going into the turn: &quot;I let my horse drop back, when I went to drop in, they started backing up into me. I said, &#x27;I don&#x27;t want to get trapped here.&#x27; So I just breezed by them.&quot; Secretariat completed the second quarter mile of the race in under 22 seconds. After reaching the lead with furlongs to go, Secretariat was never challenged, and won by lengths, with Sham again finishing second and Our Native in third, a further eight lengths back. It was the first time in history that the top three finishers in the Derby and Preakness were the same; the distance between each of the horses was also the same.

The time of the race was disputed. The infield teletimer displayed a time of 1:55 but it had malfunctioned because of damage caused by people crossing the track to reach the infield. The Pimlico Race Course clocker E.T. McLean Jr. announced a hand time of 1:54, but two &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot; clockers claimed the time was 1:53, which would have broken the track record of 1:54 set by Cañonero II. Tapes of Secretariat and Cañonero II were played side by side by CBS, and Secretariat got to the finish line first on tape, though this was not a reliable method of timing a horse race at the time. The Maryland Jockey Club, which managed the Pimlico racetrack and is responsible for maintaining Preakness records, discarded both the electronic and &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot; times and recognized the clocker&#x27;s 1:54 as the official time; however, the &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot;, for the first time in history, printed its own clocking of 1:53 underneath the official time in the chart of the race.

On June 19, 2012, a special meeting of the Maryland Racing Commission was convened at Laurel Park at the request of Penny Chenery, who hired companies to conduct a forensic review of the videotapes of the race. After over two hours of testimony, the commission unanimously voted to change the time of Secretariat&#x27;s win from 1:54 to 1:53, establishing a new stakes record. The &quot;Daily Racing Form&quot; announced that it would honor the commission&#x27;s ruling with regard to the running time. With the revised time, Sham also would have broken the old stakes record.

As Secretariat prepared for the Belmont Stakes, he appeared on the covers of three national magazines: &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, and &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. He had become a national celebrity. William Nack wrote: &quot;Secretariat suddenly transcended horse racing and became a cultural phenomenon, a sort of undeclared national holiday from the tortures of Watergate and the Vietnam War.&quot; Chenery needed a secretary to handle all the fan mail and hired the William Morris Agency to manage public engagements. Secretariat responded to his fame by learning to pose for the camera.

====Belmont Stakes====
Only four horses ran against Secretariat for the June 9 Belmont Stakes, including Sham and three other horses thought to have little chance by the bettors: Twice A Prince, My Gallant, and Private Smiles. With so few horses in the race, and Secretariat expected to win, no &quot;show&quot; bets were taken. Secretariat was sent off as a 1–10 favorite before a crowd of 69,138, then the second largest attendance in Belmont history. The race was televised by CBS and was watched by over 15 million households, an audience share of 52%.
On race day, the track was fast, and the weather was warm and sunny. Secretariat broke well on the rail and Sham rushed up beside him. The two ran the first quarter in a quick :23 and the next quarter in a swift :22, completing the fastest opening half mile in the history of the race and opening ten lengths on the rest of the field. After the six-furlong mark, Sham began to tire, ultimately finishing last. Secretariat continued the fast pace and opened up a larger and larger margin on the field. His time for the mile was 1:34, over a second faster than the next fastest Belmont mile fraction in history, set by his sire Bold Ruler, who had eventually tired and finished third. Secretariat, however, did not falter. Turcotte said, &quot;This horse really paced himself. He is smart: I think he knew he was going miles, I never pushed him.&quot; In the stretch, Secretariat opened a lead of almost of a mile on the rest of the field. At the finish, he won by 31 lengths, breaking the margin-of-victory record set by Triple Crown winner Count Fleet in 1943 of 25 lengths.
CBS Television announcer Chic Anderson described the horse&#x27;s pace in a famous commentary:
The time for the race was not only a record, it was the fastest miles on dirt in history, 2:24 flat, breaking by more than two seconds the track and stakes record of 2:26 set 16 years earlier by Gallant Man. Secretariat&#x27;s record still stands as an American record on the dirt. If the Beyer Speed Figure calculation had been developed during that time, Andrew Beyer calculated that Secretariat would have earned a figure of 139, the highest he has ever assigned.

A large crowd had started gathering around the paddock hours before the Belmont, many missing the races run earlier in the day for a chance to see the horses up close. Secretariat and Chenery were greeted with an enthusiasm that Chenery responded to with a wave or smile; Secretariat was imperturbable. A large cheer went up at the break, but as the race went on, the two most commonly reported reactions were disbelief and fear that Secretariat had gone too fast. When it was clear that Secretariat would win, the sound reportedly made the grandstand shake. &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot; magazine editor Kent Hollingsworth described the impact: &quot;Two twenty-four flat! I don&#x27;t believe it. Impossible. But I saw it. I can&#x27;t breathe. He won by a sixteenth of a mile! I saw it. I have to believe it.&quot;

The race is widely considered the greatest performance by a North American racehorse. Secretariat became the ninth Triple Crown winner in history, and the first since Citation in 1948, a gap of 25 years. Bettors holding 5,427 winning parimutuel tickets on Secretariat never redeemed them, presumably keeping them as souvenirs (and because the tickets would have paid only $2.20 on a $2 bet).

====Arlington Invitational====
Three weeks after his win at Belmont, Secretariat was shipped to Arlington Park for the June 30th Arlington Invitational. Laurin explained: &quot;Even before the Belmont, you remember, I said I really didn&#x27;t know how I could give this horse a rest. He&#x27;s so strong and full of energy. Well, this is only a week and a half after the Belmont, and believe me when I tell you, if I don&#x27;t run this horse he&#x27;s going to hurt himself in his stall. So we decided it would be nice to race him in Chicago to let the people in the Midwest have a chance to see him run.&quot; The race was run at miles with a purse of $125,000. The challengers were grouped as a single betting entry at 6–1: Secretariat was 1–20 (the legal minimum) and created a minus pool of $17,941.

Mayor Richard Daley of Chicago declared that the Saturday of the race was Secretariat Day. A crowd of 41,223 (the largest at Arlington in three decades) greeted his arrival on the track with sustained applause. Secretariat broke poorly but soon went to the lead, setting slow early fractions. He gathered momentum on the final turn and eventually won by nine lengths in 1:47 flat, just off the track record set by Damascus. George Plimpton commented, &quot;With a better start, a horse to press him and less bow to his turns, Secretariat might have posted a time that would have stood a century.&quot;

The July 10, 1973 &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that a number of Chicago fans in attendance did as their New York counterparts had in the Belmont Stakes and $11,170 worth of winning tickets on Secretariat had not been cashed.

====Whitney Stakes====
Secretariat next went to Saratoga, popularly nicknamed &quot;the graveyard of champions&quot;, in preparation for the Whitney Stakes on August 4, where he would face older horses for the first time. On July 27, he put in a stunning workout of 1:34 for a mile on a sloppy track, a time that would have broken Saratoga&#x27;s track record. On race day though, he was beaten by the Allen Jerkens-trained Onion, a four-year-old gelding that had set a track record at furlongs in his previous start. The track condition for the Whitney was labelled fast but was running slow, especially along the inside rail. Secretariat broke poorly and Onion led from the start, setting a slow pace running well off the rail. Down the backstretch, Turcotte chose to make his move along the rail rather than sweeping wide. Secretariat responded more sluggishly than usual and Turcotte went to the whip. Secretariat closed to within a head on the final turn before Onion pulled ahead in the straight to win by a length. A record crowd of more than 30,000 witnessed what was described as an &quot;astonishing&quot; upset.

Despite Jerkens&#x27;s reputation as the &quot;Giant Killer,&quot; Secretariat&#x27;s stunning loss can possibly be attributed to a viral infection, which caused a low-grade fever and diarrhea. &quot;I was learning then that anything could happen in horse racing,&quot; said Chenery. &quot;We knew he had a low-grade infection. But we decided he was strong enough to win anyway, and we were wrong.&quot;

Secretariat lost his appetite and acted sluggishly for several days. Charles Hatton wrote: &quot;He seemed distressingly ill walking off, and he missed the Travers. Returned to Belmont to point for the $250,000 Marlboro, the sport&#x27;s pin-up horse looked bloody awful, rather like one of those sick paintings which betoken an inner theatre of the macabre. It required supernatural recuperative powers to recover as he did. He was subjected to four severe preps in two weeks. Astonishingly, he gained weight and blossomed with every trial.&quot;

====Marlboro Cup====
On September 15, Secretariat returned to Belmont Park in the inaugural Marlboro Cup, which was originally intended to be a match race with stablemate Riva Ridge, the 1972 Derby and Belmont Stakes winner. After Secretariat&#x27;s loss in the Whitney, the field was expanded to invite top horses from across the country. Entries included 1972 turf champion and top California stakes winner Cougar II, Canadian champion Kennedy Road, 1972 American champion three-year-old colt Key to the Mint, Travers winner Annihilate &#x27;Em (the only other three-year-old in the race), and Onion. Riva Ridge was assigned top weight of 127 pounds (one pound over the weight-for-age scale), Key to the Mint and Cougar II were at 126 pounds, scale weight, while Secretariat was at 124, three pounds over scale for his age. The field included five champions, and the seven starters had won 63 stakes races between them.

It rained the night before, but the track dried out by race time. Secretariat stalked a fast pace in fifth, while Riva Ridge rated just behind Onion and Kennedy Road. Around the turn, Secretariat raced wide and started to make up ground. Coming into the stretch, Secretariat overtook Riva Ridge, while the other early leaders dropped back. Secretariat drew away to win, completing miles in 1:45 , then a world record on the dirt for the distance. Riva Ridge ran second with Cougar II in third and Onion in fourth. Turcotte said, &quot;Today he was the old Secretariat and he did it on his own.&quot; The purse for the Marlboro Cup was $250,000, then the highest prize money offered: the win made Secretariat the 13th thoroughbred millionaire in history.

====Woodward Stakes====
After the Marlboro Cup, the original plan was to enter Riva Ridge in the mile Woodward Stakes, just two weeks later, while Secretariat put in some slow workouts on the turf in preparation for the Man o&#x27; War Stakes in October. It rained before the Woodward and the track was sloppy, which Riva Ridge could not handle, so Secretariat was entered in his place. Secretariat led into the straight but was overtaken by the Allen Jerkens-trained four-year-old Prove Out, who pulled clear to win by lengths despite carrying seven more pounds than Secretariat under the weight-for-age conditions of the race. Prove Out ran the race of his life that day: his time was the second-fastest mile-and-a-half on the dirt in Belmont Park&#x27;s history despite the sloppy conditions. Prove Out went on to beat Riva Ridge in that year&#x27;s Jockey Club Gold Cup.

====Man o&#x27; War Stakes====
On October 8, just nine days after the Woodward, Secretariat was moved to turf for the Man O&#x27; War Stakes at a distance of miles. He faced Tentam, who had set a world record for miles on the turf earlier that summer, and five others. Secretariat went to the lead early, followed by Tentam, who gradually closed the gap down the backstretch. Tentam got to within a half-length before Secretariat responded, pulling away by three lengths. Tentam made another run around the far turn, but Secretariat again drew away, eventually winning by five lengths over Tentam, with Big Spruce seven and a half lengths further back in third. Secretariat set a course record time of 2:24. After the race, Turcotte explained that &quot;when Tentam came up to him in the backstretch I just chirped to him and he pulled away.&quot;

====Canadian International Stakes====
The syndication deal for Secretariat precluded the horse racing past age three. Accordingly, Secretariat&#x27;s last race was against older horses in the Canadian International Stakes over one and five-eighths miles on the turf at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario, Canada on October 28, 1973. The race was chosen in part because of long-time ties between E.P. Taylor and the Chenery family, and partly to honor Secretariat&#x27;s Canadian connections, Laurin and Turcotte. Turcotte missed the race with a five-day suspension: Eddie Maple got the mount.

The day of the race was cold, windy and wet, but the Marshall turf course was firm. Despite the weather, some 35,000 people turned out to greet Secretariat in a &quot;virtual hysteria.” His biggest opponents were Kennedy Road, whom he had beaten in the Marlboro Cup, and Big Spruce, who had finished third in the Man o&#x27; War. Kennedy Road went to the early lead, while Secretariat moved to second after breaking from an outside post. On the backstretch, Secretariat made his move and forged to the lead. &quot;Snorting steam in the raw twilight&quot;, he rounded the far turn with a 12-length lead before gearing down in the final furlong, ultimately winning by lengths. Once again, many winning tickets went uncashed by souvenir hunters.

After the race, Secretariat was brought to Aqueduct Racetrack where he was paraded with Turcotte dressed in the Meadow silks before a crowd of 32,990 in his final public appearance. &quot;It&#x27;s a sad day, and yet it&#x27;s a great day,&quot; said Laurin. &quot;I certainly wish he could run as a 4-year-old. He&#x27;s a great horse and he loves to run.&quot;

Altogether, Secretariat won 16 of his 21 career races, with three seconds and one third, and total earnings of $1,316,808.

For 1973, Secretariat was again named Horse of the Year and also won Eclipse Awards as the American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse and the American Champion Male Turf Horse.

==Retirement==

===Stud career===
When Secretariat first retired to Claiborne Farm, his sperm showed some signs of immaturity, so he was bred to three non-thoroughbred mares in December 1973 to test his fertility. One of these, an Appaloosa named Leola, produced Secretariat&#x27;s first foal in November 1974. Named First Secretary, the foal was a chestnut like his sire, but spotted like his dam.

Secretariat&#x27;s first official foal crop, arriving in 1975, consisted of 28 foals, the best of which was Dactylographer, who won the William Hill Futurity in October 1977. The first crop also included Canadian Bound, who at the 1976 Keeneland July sale was the first yearling to break the $1 million barrier, selling for $1.5 million. Canadian Bound, however, was a complete failure in racing, and for several years, the value of Secretariat&#x27;s offspring declined considerably, especially given the rising popularity of Northern Dancer&#x27;s offspring in the sales ring.

Secretariat eventually sired a number of major stakes winners, including:
* General Assembly, winner of the 1979 Travers Stakes, setting a track record of 2:00 flat that stood for 37 years.
* Lady&#x27;s Secret, 1986 Horse of the Year.
* Risen Star, 1988 Preakness and Belmont Stakes winner.
* Kingston Rule, 1990 Melbourne Cup winner, breaking the course record.
* Tinners Way, born in 1990 to Secretariat&#x27;s last crop, winner of the 1994 and 1995 Pacific Classic.

Ultimately, Secretariat officially sired 663 named foals, including 341 winners (51.4%) and 54 stakes winners (8.1%). There has been some criticism of Secretariat as a stallion, mainly because he did not produce male offspring of his own ability and did not leave a leading sire son behind, but his legacy is assured through the quality of his daughters, several of whom were excellent racers and even more of whom were excellent producers. In 1992, Secretariat was the leading broodmare sire in North America. Overall, Secretariat&#x27;s daughters produced 24 Grade/Group 1 winners. As a broodmare sire, Secretariat&#x27;s most notable progeny were:
* Weekend Surprise, a stakes winner and the 1992 Kentucky Broodmare of the Year. Her sons include 1990 Preakness winner Summer Squall and 1992 Horse of the Year A.P. Indy.
* Terlingua, a stakes winner and dam of leading sire Storm Cat.
* Secrettame, a stakes winner and dam of important sire Gone West, whose descendants include Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes winner Smarty Jones.
* Six Crowns, dam of champion two-year-old and sire Chief&#x27;s Crown.
* Sister Dot, dam of champion two-year-old and sire Dehere.
* Celtic Assembly, dam of Volksraad, leading sire in New Zealand.
* Betty&#x27;s Secret, dam of Secreto, winner of The Derby, and Istabraq, three-time winner of the Champion Hurdle.

Through Weekend Surprise and Terlingua alone, Secretariat appears in the pedigree of numerous champions. Weekend Surprise&#x27;s son A.P. Indy was the leading sire in North America in 2003 and 2006, and is the sire of 2003 Horse of the Year Mineshaft and 2007 Belmont Stakes winner Rags to Riches. He has also established a successful sire-line that leads to Kentucky Derby winners Orb and California Chrome. A.P. Indy&#x27;s leading sire-line descendant is Tapit, who led the sire list in 2014–2015 and is the sire of Belmont Stakes winners Tonalist and Creator. Terlingua&#x27;s son Storm Cat is also a two time leading sire, whose offspring include Giant&#x27;s Causeway, three-time leading sire in North America. Storm Cat also sired Yankee Gentleman, who is the broodmare sire of 2015 Triple Crown winner American Pharoah. Both Storm Cat and A.P. Indy appear in the pedigree of 2018 Triple Crown winner Justify.

Inbreeding to Secretariat has also proven successful, as exemplified by numerous graded stakes winners, including two-time Horse of the Year Wise Dan, as well as sprint champion Speightstown.

Secretariat&#x27;s paddock at Claiborne Farm bordered three other stallions: Drone, Sir Ivor, and Hall of Fame inductee Spectacular Bid. Secretariat did not pay much attention to Drone or Sir Ivor, but he and Spectacular Bid became friendly and occasionally raced each other along the fence line between their paddocks.

===Death===
In the fall of 1989, Secretariat became afflicted with laminitis—a painful and debilitating hoof condition. When his condition failed to improve after a month of treatment, he was euthanized on October 4 at the age of 19. Secretariat was buried at Claiborne Farm, given the rare honor of being buried whole (traditionally only the head, heart, and hooves of a winning race horse are buried).

At the time of Secretariat&#x27;s death, the veterinarian who performed the necropsy, Thomas Swerczek, head pathologist at the University of Kentucky, did not weigh Secretariat&#x27;s heart, but stated, &quot;We just stood there in stunned silence. We couldn&#x27;t believe it. The heart was perfect. There were no problems with it. It was just this huge engine.&quot; Later, Swerczek also performed a necropsy on Sham, who died in 1993. Swerczek did weigh Sham&#x27;s heart, and it was . Based on Sham&#x27;s measurement, and having necropsied both horses, he estimated Secretariat&#x27;s heart probably weighed , or about 2.5 times that of the average horse ().

An extremely large heart is a trait that occasionally occurs in thoroughbreds, hypothesized to be linked to a genetic condition, called the &quot;x-factor&quot;, passed down in specific inheritance patterns. The x-factor can be traced to the historic racehorse Eclipse, who was necropsied after his death in 1789. Because Eclipse&#x27;s heart appeared to be much larger than the hearts of other horses, it was weighed, and found to be , almost twice the normal weight. Eclipse is believed to have passed the trait on via his daughters, and pedigree research verified that Secretariat traces his dam line to a daughter of Eclipse. Secretariat&#x27;s success as a broodmare sire has been linked by some to this large heart theory. However, it has not been proven whether the x-factor exists, let alone if it contributes to athletic ability.

==Honors and recognition==
Secretariat was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1974, the year following his Triple Crown victory. In 1994, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; ranked Secretariat #17 in their list of the 40 greatest sports figures of the past 40 years. In 1999, ESPN listed him 35th of the 100 greatest North American athletes of the 20th century, the highest of three non-humans on the list (the other two were also racehorses: Man o&#x27; War at 84th and Citation at 97th). Secretariat ranked second behind Man o&#x27; War in &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot;&#x27;s List of the Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century. He was also ranked second behind Man o&#x27; War by both a six-member panel of experts assembled by the Associated Press, and a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; panel of seven experts.

On October 16, 1999, in a ceremony conducted in the winner&#x27;s circle at Keeneland Race Course in Lexington, the U.S. Postal Service honored Secretariat with a 33-cent postage stamp bearing his image. In 2005, Secretariat was featured in ESPN Classic&#x27;s show &quot;Who&#x27;s No. 1?&quot; in the episode &quot;Greatest Sports Performances&quot;. He was the only nonhuman on the list, with his run at Belmont ranking second behind Wilt Chamberlain&#x27;s 100-point game. On May 2, 2007, Secretariat was inducted into the Kentucky Athletic Hall of Fame, marking the first time an animal received this honor. In 2013, Secretariat was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in honor of his victory in the Canadian International 40 years earlier. Secretariat was also the focus of a 2013 segment of &quot;60 Minutes Sports&quot;. In March 2016, Secretariat&#x27;s Triple Crown victory was rated #13 in the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; listing of the 100 Greatest Moments in Sports History.

Due to Secretariat&#x27;s enduring popularity, Chenery remained a prominent figure in racing and a powerful advocate for thoroughbred aftercare and veterinary research until her death in 2017. In 2004, the Maker&#x27;s Mark Secretariat Center, dedicated to reschooling former racehorses and matching them to new homes, opened at the Kentucky Horse Park. In 2010, Chenery developed the Secretariat Vox Populi (&quot;voice of the people&quot;) Award, which is voted for by racing fans. It is intended to acknowledge &quot;the horse whose popularity and racing excellence best resounded with the American public and gained recognition for thoroughbred racing.&quot; The consideration of the racing fan&#x27;s engagement is what distinguishes the Vox Populi award from others. The first honoree in 2010 was Zenyatta, that year&#x27;s Horse of the Year, while the second award went to Rapid Redux, a former claimer who went on to win 22 consecutive races at smaller racetracks. Paynter received the 2012 award for his battle with laminitis, the same condition that led to Secretariat&#x27;s death. &quot;Paynter&#x27;s popularity stems from his ability to battle and exceed expectations, making him the perfect choice as the recipient of this year&#x27;s Vox Populi Award&quot;, said Chenery. &quot;After seeing firsthand the devastating effects of this disease, I am even more convinced that the industry must continue to diligently fight laminitis. The progress we have made to date clearly benefited Paynter—a beautiful colt with a tremendous spirit.&quot;

Various states and localities have also honored Secretariat. According to ESPN, 263 roads in the United States are named after him, more than any other athlete. Secretariat Drive is the most common option. In Illinois, the Secretariat Stakes was created in 1974 to honor his appearance at Arlington Park in 1973. In honor of Secretariat and Kentucky&#x27;s horse racing history, the University of Kentucky football uniforms incorporate blue-and-white checkers reminiscent of the silks of Meadow Stables.

In Virginia, The Meadow, the farm at which he was foaled, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is now known as The Meadow Historic District. In 2023, the Virginia ABC honored 50th Anniversary of Secretariat&#x27;s Triple Crown win by making Ragged Branch Secretariat Reserve bourbon. Secretariat has been honored multiple times by Virginia&#x27;s General Assembly with Triple Crown anniversary proclamations. In 2023, Caroline County received a proclamation by the General Assembly to honor the 50th anniversary of Secretariat&#x27;s record-setting Triple Crown-win.

===Statues===

In 1974, Paul Mellon commissioned a bronze statue, sometimes known as &quot;Secretariat in Full Stride&quot;, from John Skeaping. The life-size statue remained in the center of the walking ring at Belmont Park until 1988 when it was replaced by a replica. The original is now located at the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

The Kentucky Horse Park has two other life-sized statues of Secretariat. The first, created by Jim Reno in 1992, shows Secretariat as an older sire, while the second, completed by Edwin Bogucki in 2004, shows him being led into the winner&#x27;s circle after the Kentucky Derby.

In 2015, a statue of Secretariat and Ron Turcotte crossing the finish line at the Belmont Stakes was unveiled in Grand Falls, New Brunswick, Turcotte&#x27;s hometown.

On October 12, 2019, a new monument was unveiled during the Secretariat Festival at Keeneland in Lexington. The two and a half times life-size bronze statue by Jocelyn Russell shows Secretariat and Turcotte winning the Kentucky Derby. After the Festival, it was permanently relocated to the center of the traffic circle at Old Frankfort Pike and Alexandria Drive. A duplicate statue by Russell began a tour in Ashland, Virginia in March 2023.

=== Media ===
Louisville’s Churchill Downs was a set location for several racing scenes in the 2010 film, &quot;Secretariat&quot;. The film, starring Diane Lane as Penny Chenery, John Malkovich as Lucien Laurin, and Otto Thorwarth as Ron Turcotte, was written by Mike Rich, directed by Randall Wallace, and produced by Walt Disney Pictures.

A fictionalized version of Secretariat appears in the animated series &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot;, wherein he is depicted as an anthropomorphic horse who is a world-class athlete, voiced by John Krasinski.

==Racing statistics==


Secretariat&#x27;s earnings in 1973 were, at the time, a single-season record.

==Pedigree==
Secretariat was sired by Bold Ruler, who led the North America sire list eight times, more than any other stallion in the 20th century. He also led the juvenile (two-year-old) sire list a record six times. Before Secretariat&#x27;s Triple Crown run, Bold Ruler was often categorized as a sire of precocious juveniles that lacked stamina or did not train on past age two. However, even before Secretariat, Bold Ruler actually had sired 11 stakes winners of races at 10 furlongs or more. Ultimately, seven of the ten Kentucky Derby winners in the 1970s can be traced directly to Bold Ruler in their lines, including Secretariat and fellow Triple Crown winner Seattle Slew.

Secretariat&#x27;s dam was Somethingroyal, the 1973 Kentucky Broodmare of the Year. Although Somethingroyal was unplaced in her only start, she had an excellent pedigree. Her sire Princequillo was the leading broodmare sire from 1966 to 1970 and was noted as a source of stamina and soundness. Her dam Imperatrice was a stakes winner who was purchased by Christopher Chenery at a dispersal sale in 1947 for $30,000. Imperatrice produced several stakes winners and stakes producers for the Meadow. Prior to foaling Secretariat at age 18, Somethingroyal had already produced three stakes winners: Sir Gaylord, First Family and Syrian Sea, the latter a full sister to Secretariat. Sir Gaylord became an important sire, whose offspring included Epsom Derby winner Sir Ivor.

Breeders speak of a &quot;nick&quot; occurring when a sire or grandsire produces significantly better offspring from the daughters of one particular sire than with mares from other bloodlines. The breeding of Bold Ruler with Somethingroyal is an example of a famous nick between Bold Ruler&#x27;s sire Nasrullah and daughters of Princequillo. The goal was to balance the speed, precocity, and fiery temperament provided by the Nasrullah side of the pedigree with Princequillo&#x27;s stamina, soundness, and sensible temperament.

<doc id="62404" wikidata="Q515217" url="?curid=62404" title="Lovebird">
<text>Lovebird is the common name for the genus Agapornis, a small group of parrots in the Old World parrot family Psittaculidae. Of the nine species in the genus, all are native to the African continent, with the grey-headed lovebird being native to the African island of Madagascar. Social and affectionate, the name comes from the parrots&#x27; strong, monogamous pair bonding and the long periods which paired birds spend sitting together. Lovebirds live in small flocks and eat fruit, vegetables, grasses, and seeds. Some species are kept as pets, and several coloured mutations have been selectively bred in aviculture. The average lifespan is 10 to 12 years.

==Description==
Lovebirds are in length, up to 24 cm in wingspan with 9 cm for a single wing and in weight. They are among the smallest parrots, characterised by a stocky build, a short blunt tail, and a relatively large, sharp beak. Wildtype lovebirds are mostly green with a variety of colours on their upper body, depending on the species. The Fischer&#x27;s lovebird, black-cheeked lovebird, and the masked lovebird have a prominent white ring around their eyes. Many colour mutant varieties have been produced by selective breeding of the species that are popular in aviculture. , there are 30 known plumage colour variations among lovebirds, which are caused by pigments called psittacofulvins.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Agapornis&quot; was described by the English naturalist Prideaux John Selby in 1836. The name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;agape&quot; meaning &quot;love&quot; and &quot;ornis&quot; meaning &quot;bird&quot;. The type species is the black-collared lovebird (&quot;Agapornis swindernianus&quot;), which was originally placed into the genus &quot;Psittacus&quot; within a section called Psittacula by naturalist Heinrich Kuhl. Selby contended that this placement rather than a separate genus was &quot;artificial&quot; and done &quot;without regard to the structure, habits, or distribution of the species.&quot;

The genus contains nine species of which five are monotypic and four are divided into subspecies. They are native to mainland Africa and the island of Madagascar. In the wild, the different species are separated geographically.

Traditionally, lovebirds are divided into three groups:
*the sexually dimorphic species: Madagascar, Abyssinian, and red-headed lovebird
*the intermediate species: peach-faced lovebird
*the white-eye-ringed species: masked, Fischer&#x27;s, Lilian&#x27;s, and black-cheeked lovebirds
However, this division is not fully supported by phylogenetic studies, as the species of the dimorphic group are not grouped together in a single clade.
==Species==
Species and subspecies:









==Nesting==
Depending on the species of lovebird, the female will carry nesting material into the nest in various ways. The peach-faced lovebird, for example, tucks nesting material in the feathers of its rump.

==Feral populations==
Feral populations of Fischer&#x27;s lovebirds and masked lovebirds live in cities of East Africa. There are interspecific hybrids that exist between these two species. The hybrid has a reddish-brown head and orange on upper chest, but otherwise resembles the masked lovebird.

There are two feral colonies present in the Pretoria region (Silver Lakes, Faerie Glen and Centurion) in South Africa. They probably originated from birds that escaped from aviaries. They consist mostly of masked, black cheeked, Fischer and hybrid birds and vary in colours. White (not albino) and yellow as well as blue occur in many cases. The white ringed eyes are very prominent.

== Diet and health ==
Parrot species (including cockatiels) are biologically vegetarian species.

Wild lovebirds may harbor diseases such as avian polyomavirus.

<doc id="62405" wikidata="Q1114471" url="?curid=62405" title="Tarsier">
<text>Tarsiers ( ) are haplorhine primates of the family Tarsiidae, which is the lone extant family within the infraorder Tarsiiformes. Although the group was prehistorically more globally widespread, all of the species living today are restricted to Maritime Southeast Asia, predominantly in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.They are found primarily in forested habitats, especially forests that have liana, since the vine gives tarsiers vertical support when climbing trees.

==Evolutionary history==
===Fossil record===
Fossils of tarsiiform primates have been found in Asia, Europe, and North America (with disputed fossils from Northern Africa), but extant tarsiers are restricted to several Southeast Asian islands. The fossil record indicates that their dentition has not changed much, except in size, over the past 45 million years.

Within the family Tarsiidae, there are two extinct genera—&quot;Xanthorhysis&quot; and &quot;Afrotarsius&quot;; however, the placement of &quot;Afrotarsius&quot; is not certain, and it is sometimes listed in its own family, Afrotarsiidae, within the infraorder Tarsiiformes, or considered an anthropoid primate.

So far, four fossil species of tarsiers are known from the fossil record:
* &quot;Tarsius eocaenus&quot; is known from the Middle Eocene in China.
* &quot;Hesperotarsius thailandicus&quot; lived during the Early Miocene in northwestern Thailand.
* &quot;Hesperotarsius sindhensis&quot; lived during the Miocene in Pakistan.
* &quot;Tarsius sirindhornae&quot; lived during the Middle Miocene in northern Thailand.

The genus &quot;Tarsius&quot; has a longer fossil record than any other primate genus, but the assignment of the Eocene and Miocene fossils to the genus is dubious.

===Classification===
The phylogenetic position of extant tarsiers within the order Primates has been debated for much of the 20th century, and tarsiers have alternately been classified with strepsirrhine primates in the suborder Prosimii, or as the sister group to the simians (Anthropoidea) in the infraorder Haplorhini. Analysis of SINE insertions, a type of macromutation to the DNA, is argued to offer very persuasive evidence for the monophyly of Haplorhini, where other lines of evidence, such as DNA sequence data, remain ambiguous. Thus, some systematists argue the debate is conclusively settled in favor of a monophyletic Haplorrhini. In common with simians, tarsiers have a mutation in the L-gulonolactone oxidase (GULO) gene, which prevents their bodies from synthesizing vitamin C so they must find it in the diet. Since the strepsirrhines do not have this mutation and have retained the ability to make vitamin C, the genetic trait that confers the need for it in the diet would tend to place tarsiers with haplorhines.

At a lower phylogenetic level, the tarsiers have, until recently, all been placed in the genus &quot;Tarsius&quot;, while it was debated whether the species should be placed in two (a Sulawesi and a Philippine-western group) or three separate genera (Sulawesi, Philippine and western groups). Species level taxonomy is complex, with morphology often being of limited use compared to vocalizations. Further confusion existed over the validity of certain names. Among others, the widely used &quot;T. dianae&quot; has been shown to be a junior synonym of &quot;T. dentatus&quot;, and comparably, &quot;T. spectrum&quot; is now considered a junior synonym of &quot;T. tarsier&quot;.
In 2010, Colin Groves and Myron Shekelle suggested splitting the genus &quot;Tarsius&quot; into three genera, the Philippine tarsiers (genus &quot;Carlito&quot;), the western tarsiers (genus &quot;Cephalopachus&quot;), and the eastern tarsiers (genus &quot;Tarsius&quot;). This was based on differences in dentition, eye size, limb and hand length, tail tufts, tail sitting pads, the number of mammae, chromosome count, socioecology, vocalizations, and distribution. The senior taxon of the species, &quot;T. tarsier&quot; was restricted to the population of a Selayar island, which then required the resurrection of the defunct taxon &quot;T. fuscus&quot;.

In 2014, scientists published the results of a genetic study from across the range of the Philippine tarsier, revealing previously unrecognised genetic diversity. Three subspecies are recognised in the established taxonomy: &quot;Carlito syrichta syrichta&quot; from Leyte and Samar, &quot;C. syrichta fraterculus&quot; from Bohol, and &quot;C. syrichta carbonarius&quot; from Mindanao. Their analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences suggested that ssp. &quot;syrichta&quot; and &quot;fraterculus&quot; may represent a single lineage, whereas ssp. &quot;carbonarius&quot; may represent two lineages – one occupies the majority of Mindanao while the other is in northeastern Mindanao and the nearby Dinagat Island, which the authors termed the &#x27;Dinagat-Caraga tarsier&#x27;. More detailed studies that integrate morphological data will be needed to review the taxonomy of tarsiers in the Philippines.

==Anatomy and physiology==
Tarsiers are small animals with enormous eyes; each eyeball is approximately in diameter and is as large as, or in some cases larger than, its entire brain. The unique cranial anatomy of the tarsier results from the need to balance their large eyes and heavy head so they are able to wait silently for nutritious prey. Tarsiers have a strong auditory sense, and their auditory cortex is distinct. Tarsiers also have long hind limbs, owing mostly to the elongated tarsus bones of the feet, from which the animals get their name. The combination of their elongated tarsi and fused tibiofibulae makes them morphologically specialized for vertical clinging and leaping. The head and body range from 10 to 15 cm in length, but the hind limbs are about twice this long (including the feet), and they also have a slender tail from 20 to 25 cm long. Their fingers are also elongated, with the third finger being about the same length as the upper arm. Most of the digits have nails, but the second and third toes of the hind feet bear claws instead, which are used for grooming. Tarsiers have soft, velvety fur, which is generally buff, beige, or ochre in color.

Tarsier morphology allows for them to move their heads 180 degrees in either direction, allowing for them to see 360 degrees around them. Their dental formula is also unique: Unlike many nocturnal vertebrates, tarsiers lack a light-reflecting layer (tapetum lucidum) of the retina and have a fovea.

The tarsier&#x27;s brain is different from that of other primates in terms of the arrangement of the connections between the two eyes and the lateral geniculate nucleus, which is the main region of the thalamus that receives visual information. The sequence of cellular layers receiving information from the ipsilateral (same side of the head) and contralateral (opposite side of the head) eyes in the lateral geniculate nucleus distinguishes tarsiers from lemurs, lorises, and monkeys, which are all similar in this respect. Some neuroscientists suggested that &quot;this apparent difference distinguishes tarsiers from all other primates, reinforcing the view that they arose in an early, independent line of primate evolution.&quot;

Philippine tarsiers are capable of hearing frequencies as high as 91 kHz. They are also capable of vocalizations with a dominant frequency of 70 kHz.

Unlike most primates, male tarsiers do not have bacula.

==Behavior==
Pygmy tarsiers differ from other species in terms of their morphology, communication, and behavior. The differences in morphology that distinguish pygmy tarsiers from other species are likely based on their high altitude environment.

All tarsier species are nocturnal in their habits, but like many nocturnal organisms, some individuals may show more or less activity during the daytime. Based on the anatomy of all tarsiers, they are all adapted for leaping even though they all vary based on their species.

Ecological variation is responsible for differences in morphology and behavior in tarsiers because different species become adapted to local conditions based on the level of altitude. For example, the colder climate at higher elevations can influence cranial morphology.

Tarsiers tend to be extremely shy animals and are sensitive to bright lights, loud noises, and physical contact. They have been reported to behave suicidally when stressed or kept in captivity.

===Predators===
Due to their small size, tarsiers are prey to various other animals. Tarsiers primarily inhabit the lower vegetation layers as they face threats from both terrestrial predators such as cats, lizards, and snakes, and aerial predators such as owls and birds. By residing in these lower layers, they can minimize their chances of being preyed upon by staying off the ground and yet still low enough to avoid birds of prey.

Tarsiers, though known as being shy and reclusive, are known to mob predators. In nature, mobbing is the act of harassing predators to reduce the chance of being attacked. When predators are near, tarsiers will make a warning vocalization. Other tarsiers will respond to the call, and within a short period of time, 2-10 tarsiers will show up to mob the predator. The majority of the group consists of adult males, but there will occasionally be a female or two. While tarsier groups only contain one adult male, males from other territories will join in the mob event, meaning there are multiple alpha male tarsiers attacking the predator.

===Diet===
Tarsiers are the only entirely carnivorous extant primates, albeit mainly insectivorous, catching invertebrates by jumping at them. The tarsiers also opportunistically prey on a variety of arboreal and small forest animals, including orthopterans, scarab beetles, small flying frogs, lizards and, occasionally, amphibious crabs that climb into the lower sections of trees. However, it has been found that their favorite prey are arthropods, beetles, arachnids, cockroaches, grasshoppers, katydids, cicadas, and walking sticks. Tarsiers are, rarely, also known to prey on baby birds, small tree snakes and even baby bats.

===Reproduction===
Gestation takes about six months, and tarsiers give birth to single offspring. Young tarsiers are born furred, and with open eyes, and are able to climb within a day of birth. They reach sexual maturity by the end of their second year. Sociality and mating system varies, with tarsiers from Sulawesi living in small family groups, while Philippine and western tarsiers are reported to sleep and forage alone.

==Conservation==
Tarsiers have never formed successful breeding colonies in captivity; this may be due in part to their special feeding requirements.

A sanctuary near the town of Corella, on the Philippine island of Bohol, has had some success restoring tarsier populations. The Philippines Tarsier Foundation has developed a large, semi-wild enclosure known as the Tarsier Research and Development Center. Carlito Pizarras, also known as the &quot;Tarsier man&quot;, founded the sanctuary, where visitors can observe tarsiers in the wild. The trees in the sanctuary are populated with nocturnal insects that make up the tarsier&#x27;s diet.

The conservation status of all tarsiers is vulnerable to extinction. Tarsiers are a conservation-dependent species, meaning that they need to have more and improved management of protected habitats, or they will become extinct in the future.

The first quantitative study on the activity patterns of captive Philippine tarsiers (&quot;Tarsius syrichta&quot;) was conducted at the Subayon Conservation Centre for the Philippine Tarsier in Bilar, Bohol. From December 2014 to January 2016, female and male &quot;T. syrichta&quot; were observed based on their time apportioned to normal activities during non-mating versus mating seasons. During the non-mating season, a significant amount of their waking hours was spent scanning prior to resting, foraging, and traveling. Feeding, scent-marking, self-grooming, social activities, and other activities were minimal. Scanning was still a common activity among the paired sexes during mating season. However, resting markedly decreased, while increases in travel and foraging were evident. 

The 2008-described Siau Island tarsier in Indonesia is regarded as critically endangered and was listed among The World&#x27;s 25 Most Endangered Primates by Conservation International and the IUCN/SCC Primate Specialist Group in 2008.
The Malaysian government protects tarsiers by listing them in the Totally Protected Animals of Sarawak, on the island of Borneo, where they are commonly found.

<text>A schooner ( ) is a type of sailing vessel defined by its rig: fore-and-aft rigged on all of two or more masts and, in the case of a two-masted schooner, the foremast generally being shorter than the mainmast. A common variant, the topsail schooner also has a square topsail on the foremast, to which may be added a topgallant. Differing definitions leave uncertain whether the addition of a fore course would make such a vessel a brigantine. Many schooners are gaff-rigged, but other examples include Bermuda rig and the staysail schooner.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;schooner&quot; first appeared in eastern North America in the early 1700s. The term may be related to a Scots word meaning to skip over water, or to skip stones.

==History==
The origins of schooner rigged vessels is obscure, but there is good evidence of them from the early 17th century in paintings by Dutch marine artists. The earliest known illustration of a schooner depicts a yacht owned by the mayors (Dutch: burgemeesters) of Amsterdam, drawn by the Dutch artist Rool and dated 1600. Later examples show schooners (Dutch: schoeners) in Amsterdam in 1638 and New Amsterdam in 1627. Paintings by Van de Velde (1633–1707) and an engraving by Jan Kip of the Thames at Lambeth, dated 1697, suggest that schooner rig was common in England and Holland by the end of the 17th century. The &quot;Royal Transport&quot; was an example of a large British-built schooner, launched in 1695 at Chatham.

The schooner rig was used in vessels with a wide range of purposes. On a fast hull, good ability to windward was useful for privateers, blockade runners, slave ships, smaller naval craft and opium clippers. Packet boats (built for the fast conveyance of passengers and goods) were often schooners. Fruit schooners were noted for their quick passages, taking their perishable cargoes on routes such as the Azores to Britain. Some pilot boats adopted the rig. The fishing vessels that worked the Grand Banks of Newfoundland were schooners, and held in high regard as an outstanding development of the type. In merchant use, the ease of handling in confined waters and smaller crew requirements made schooners a common rig, especially in the 19th century. Some schooners worked on deep sea routes. In British home waters, schooners usually had cargo-carrying hulls that were designed to take the ground in drying harbours (or, even, to unload dried out on an open beach). The last of these once-common craft had ceased trading by the middle of the 20th century. Some very large schooners with five or more masts were built in the United States from circa 1880–1920. They mostly carried bulk cargoes such as coal and timber. In yachting, schooners predominated in the early years of the America&#x27;s Cup. In more recent times, schooners have been used as sail training ships.

The type was further developed in British North America starting around 1713. In the 1700s and 1800s in what is now New England and Atlantic Canada schooners became popular for coastal trade, requiring a smaller crew for their size compared to then traditional ocean crossing square rig ships, and being fast and versatile. Three-masted schooners were introduced around 1800.

Schooners were popular on both sides of the Atlantic in the late 1800s and early 1900s. By 1910, 45 five-masted and 10 six-masted schooners had been built in Bath, Maine and in towns on Penobscot Bay, including Wyoming which is considered the largest wooden ship ever built. The &quot;Thomas W. Lawson&quot; was the only seven-masted schooner built.

==Rig types==
The rig is rarely found on a hull of less than 50 feet LOA, and small schooners are generally two-masted. In the two decades around 1900, larger multi-masted schooners were built in New England and on the Great Lakes with four, five, six, or even, seven masts. Schooners were traditionally gaff-rigged, and some schooners sailing today are reproductions of famous schooners of old, but modern vessels tend to be Bermuda rigged (or occasionally junk-rigged). While a sloop rig is simpler and cheaper, the schooner rig may be chosen on a larger boat so as to reduce the overall mast height and to keep each sail to a more manageable size, giving a mainsail that is easier to handle and to reef. An issue when planning a two-masted schooner&#x27;s rig is how best to fill the space between the masts: for instance, one may adopt (i) a gaff sail on the foremast (even with a Bermuda mainsail), or (ii) a main staysail, often with a fisherman topsail to fill the gap at the top in light airs.

Various types of schooners are defined by their rig configuration. Most have a bowsprit although some were built without one for crew safety, such as &quot;Adventure&quot;.

The following varieties were built:

* Grand Banks fishing schooner: includes a gaff topsail on the main mast and a fisherman&#x27;s staysail; in winter topmasts and their upper sails are taken down. &quot;Bluenose&quot; was one such example.
* Topsail schooner/Square topsail schooner: includes square topsails. A version with raked masts and known for its great speed, called the Baltimore Clipper was popular in the early 1800s.
* Four- to seven-masted schooners: these designs spread the sail area over many smaller sails, at a time when sails were hoisted by hand, though mechanical assistance was used as the ships, sails, and gaffs became too large and heavy to raise manually. These were used for coastal trade on the Atlantic coast of North America, the West Indies, South America, and some trans-Atlantic voyages. 
* Tern schooner: a three-masted schooner very popular between 1880 and 1920. &quot;Wawona&quot;, the largest of this type built, sailed on the West Coast of the United States from 1897 to 1947.

==Uses==
Schooners were built primarily for cargo, passengers, and fishing.

The Norwegian polar schooner &quot;Fram&quot; was used by both Fridtjof Nansen and Roald Amundsen in their explorations of the poles.

&quot;Bluenose&quot; was both a successful fishing boat and a racer. &quot;America&quot;, eponym of America&#x27;s Cup, was one of the few schooners ever designed for racing. This race was long dominated by schooners. Three-masted schooner &quot;Atlantic&quot; set the transatlantic sailing record for a monohull in the 1905 Kaiser&#x27;s Cup race. The record remained unbroken for nearly 100 years.

<doc id="62414" wikidata="Q597681" url="?curid=62414" title="Global Crossing">
<text>Global Crossing Limited, was a telecommunications company that provided computer networking services and operated a tier 1 carrier. It maintained a large backbone network and offered peering, virtual private networks, leased lines, audio and video conferencing, long-distance telephone, managed services, dialup, colocation centres and VoIP. Its customer base ranged from individuals to large enterprises and other carriers, with emphasis on higher-margin layered services such as managed services and VoIP with leased lines. Its core network delivered services to more than 700 cities in more than 70 countries.

Global Crossing was the first global communications provider with IPv6 natively deployed in both its private and public networks. It was legally domiciled in Bermuda and had its administrative headquarters in New Jersey.

In 1999, during the dot-com bubble, the company was valued at $47 billion, but it never had a profitable year. In 2002, the company filed for one of the largest bankruptcies in history and its executives were accused of covering up an accounting scandal. On October 3, 2011, Global Crossing was acquired by Level 3 Communications for $3 billion, including the assumption of $1.1 billion in debt.

==History==
===Founding and early growth===
In March 1997, Global Crossing was founded by Gary Winnick, the former manager of the bond desk of Drexel Burnham Lambert, and his Drexel colleagues who moved on to work at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC): Abbott L. Brown, David L. Lee, and Barry Porter. In 1997, the company raised $35 million, including investments by Winnick and the CIBC Argosy Merchant Funds (later Trimaran Capital Partners). Winnick was chairman of the company from 1997 until 2002. In 1998, he hired Lodwrick Cook, former CEO of Atlantic Richfield Company, as co-chairman. John Scanlon became the first CEO of the company in the same year, but was replaced in March 1999 by Robert Annunziata, who had resigned as president of AT&amp;T Corporation&#x27;s Business Services group to &quot;build a company from start to finish&quot;.

In May 1999, Global Crossing made an offer to acquire US West, but was outbid by Qwest. In July 1999, the company acquired Global Marine Systems, the undersea cable maintenance arm of Cable &amp; Wireless, for $885 million. Later that year, in September 1999, the company acquired Frontier Communications, the former Rochester Telephone Corporation, for $9.9 billion and renamed it Global Crossing North America. That same month, Global Crossing acquired 49% of SB Submarine Systems, and formed Asia Global Crossing, a $1.3 billion joint venture with SoftBank Group and Microsoft to build a fiber-optic network in Asia linking Japan, China, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Malaysia and the Philippines. In November 1999, Global Crossing acquired Racal Telecom for $1.65 billion.

In January 2000, the company formed a 50/50 joint venture with Hutchison Whampoa, valued at $1.2 billion, for a fiber-optic network in Hong Kong. In March 2000, Annunziata resigned, receiving $160 million during his 13-month tenure. Leo Hindery, who had joined the company a few months earlier as head of its web hosting division, GlobalCenter, then became CEO. In September 2000, the company announced a deal to sell GlobalCenter to Exodus Communications for $6.5 billion in stock. By the time the deal closed in January 2001, the stock was only worth $1.95 billion. Hindery then resigned as CEO and was replaced with Thomas Casey, a lawyer who came to Global Crossing from Merrill Lynch, where he was co-head of the global telecom investment banking group. For the year 2000, the company lost $1.4 billion.

In 2001, the company sold its local telephone operations and the Frontier name in 2001 to Frontier Communications for $3.65 billion in cash. In the summer of 2001, the company began discussing a transaction with Enron in which the company would pay Enron $650 million for its fiber-optic network in exchange for Enron paying the company $650 million to use the network, a move that would boost both companies&#x27; revenues without costing them anything. The transaction did not materialize. In October 2001, Casey was replaced by John Legere, the CEO of Global Crossing subsidiary Asia Global Crossing.

=== Bankruptcy and reemergence ===
In the fourth quarter of 2001, the company lost $3.4 billion on revenue of $793 million. In January 2002, the company filed bankruptcy. It listed total assets of $22.4 billion and debts of $12.4 billion and was paying annual interest of $600 million. As part of the bankruptcy, Hutchison Whampoa and ST Telemedia agreed to invest $750 million in the company. Hutchinson Whampoa later pulled out of the deal due to regulatory resistance.

CIBC realized an estimated gain of $2 billion from its relatively small equity investment in the company, making it one of the most profitable investments by a financial institution in the 1990s. Winnick salvaged $735 million from his $20 million investment, although his interest was worth $6 billion on paper at its peak.

In April 2002, Hutchinson Whampoa bought the company&#x27;s 50% interest in the Hong Kong joint venture for $120 million.

In November 2002, Global Crossing&#x27;s Asian subsidiary, Asia Global Crossing, filed bankruptcy and sold its assets to Asia Netcom, a subsidiary of China Netcom.

Between 1998 and 2001, Winnick sold approximately $420 million in company stock and other executives sold an additional $900 million in company stock.

On December 9, 2003, the company emerged from bankruptcy and on April 1, 2004, the company once again became a public company.

In March 2004, Gary Winnick and other ex-executives settled lawsuits filed by investors and former employees accusing the executives of committing securities fraud by using improper accounting to inflate the company&#x27;s revenue.

In October 2006, the company announced the acquisition of UK-based Fibernet Corp. for £49.8 million.

In May 2007, the company acquired Impsat, a leading Argentine telecommunications company. Global Crossing and Impsat have had a commercial relationship since 2000, when Global Crossing selected Impsat as one of its providers of Point of Presence (PoP) facilities for Global Crossing&#x27;s Latin American network, known as South American Crossing. Impsat has also been a customer of Global Crossing in Latin America since 2000.

In October 2011, Level 3 Communications acquired the company for $3 billion, including the assumption of $1.1 billion in debt.

==Controversies==

===Political activity===
The company contributed $250,000 to each of the 2000 Republican National Convention and the 2000 Democratic National Convention and made major contributions to politicians of both parties. The company also courted politicians to invest in the company. The company hired lobbyist and former United States Assistant Attorney General Anne Bingaman, married to Democratic New Mexico Senator Jeff Bingaman, paying her $2.5 million between January and June 1999 to try to block licensing of an AT&amp;T, MCI, and Sprint consortium to lay cable from the U.S. to Japan.

===Executive bonuses===
Despite the massive layoffs, unpaid employees, and cancelled pensions as a result of the bankruptcy, executives received huge bonuses and loan relief.

== Russian submarine rescue ==
In August 2000, the company was involved in an attempted rescue of a Russian submarine during the Kursk submarine disaster. Global Crossing&#x27;s undersea cable division contracted with British Defense Ministry to operate the LR5 rescue submersible. As part of the agreement, Global Crossing was to keep it on call for emergencies.

<doc id="62415" wikidata="Q1083" url="?curid=62415" title="Salerno">
<text>Salerno (, ; ; ) is an ancient city and &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) in Campania, southwestern Italy, and is the capital of the namesake province, being the second largest city in the region by number of inhabitants, after Naples. It is located on the Gulf of Salerno on the Tyrrhenian Sea. In recent history the city hosted Victor Emmanuel III, the King of Italy, who moved from Rome in 1943 after Italy negotiated a peace with the Allies in World War II, making Salerno the capital of the &quot;Government of the South&quot; () and therefore provisional government seat (and de facto Capital) for six months and so Former capitals of Italy. Some of the Allied landings during Operation Avalanche (the invasion of Italy) occurred near Salerno.

Human settlement at Salerno has a rich and vibrant past, dating back to pre-historic times. In the early Middle Ages it was an independent Lombard principality, the Principality of Salerno, which around the 11th century comprised most of Southern Italy. During this time, the Schola Medica Salernitana, the first medical school in the world, was founded. The Normans in 1077 made Salerno the capital of their rule in all continental southern Italy. In the 16th century, under the Sanseverino family, among the most powerful feudal lords in southern Italy, the city became a great centre of learning, culture and the arts, and the family hired several of the greatest intellectuals of the time. Later, in 1694, the city was struck by several catastrophic earthquakes and plagues. During a period of Spanish rule the city suffered a crisis which would last until the 18th century, but under Napoleon Salerno became part of the Parthenopean Republic. In the 19th century Salerno supported ideas of the Risorgimento and welcomed Garibaldi in 1861.

The city is divided into three distinct zones: the medieval sector, the 19th century sector and the more densely populated post-war area, with its several apartment blocks. A patron saint of Salerno is Saint Matthew, the Apostle, whose relics are kept here at the crypt of Salerno Cathedral.

==History==
===Prehistory and antiquity===
The area of what is now Salerno has been continuously settled since pre-historical times, as the discoveries of Neolithic mummy remains documents. Inhabited by Oscan-speaking populations, the region was colonized by the Etruscans, who founded the city of Irnthi in the 6th century BC, across the Irno river, in what is today city quarter of Fratte, as a part of their &quot;Dodecapolis&quot; political model they essentially replicated in Campania. This settlement represented an important base for Etruscan trade with the nearby Greek colonies of Posidonia and Elea. It was occupied by the Samnites around the 5th century BC as a consequence of the Battle of Cumae (474 BC) as part of the Syracusan sphere of influence.

With the Roman advance in Campania, Irna began to lose its importance, being supplanted by the new Roman colony (197 BC) of Salernum, developing around an initial &quot;castrum&quot;. The new city, which gradually lost its military function in favour of its role as a trade centre, was connected to Rome by the Via Popilia, which ran towards Lucania and Reggio Calabria.

Archaeological remains, although fragmentary, suggest the idea of a flourishing and lively city. Under the Emperor Diocletian, in the late 3rd century AD, Salernum became the administrative centre of the &quot;Lucania and Bruttii&quot; province.

In the following century, during the Gothic Wars, the Goths were defeated by the Byzantines, and the Salerno briefly returned to the control of Constantinople (from 553 to 568), before the Lombards invaded almost the whole peninsula. Like many coastal cities of southern Italy (Gaeta, Sorrento, Amalfi), Salerno initially remained untouched by the newcomers, falling only in 646. It subsequently became part of the Duchy of Benevento.

===Middle Ages to early modern age===

Under the Lombard dukes Salerno enjoyed the most splendid period of its history.

In 774 Arechis II of Benevento transferred the seat of the Duchy of Benevento to Salerno, in order to elude Charlemagne&#x27;s offensive and to secure for himself the control of a strategic area, the centre of coastal and internal communications in Campania.

With Arechis II, Salerno became a centre of studies with its famous Medical School. The Lombard prince ordered the city to be fortified; the Castle on the Bonadies mountain had already been built with walls and towers. In 839 Salerno declared independence from Benevento, becoming the capital of a flourishing principality stretching out to Capua, northern Calabria and Apulia up to Taranto. In 871–872, the Aghlabids besieged Salerno, but the city was relieved by Louis II of Italy.

Around the year 1000 prince Guaimar IV annexed Amalfi, Sorrento, Gaeta and the whole duchy of Apulia and Calabria, starting to conceive a future unification of the whole southern Italy under Salerno&#x27;s arms. The coins minted in the city circulated all over the Mediterranean, with the &quot;Opulenta Salernum&quot; wording to certify its richness.

However, the stability of the Principate was continually shaken by the Saracen attacks and, most of all, by internal struggles. In 1056, one of the numerous plots led to the fall of Guaimar. His weaker son Gisulf II succeeded him, but the decline of the principality had begun. In 1077 Salerno reached its zenith but soon lost all its territory to the Normans.
On 13 December 1076, the Norman conqueror Robert Guiscard, who had married Guaimar IV&#x27;s daughter Sikelgaita, besieged Salerno and defeated his brother-in-law Gisulf. In this period the royal palace of Castel Terracena and the cathedral were built, and science was boosted as the Schola Medica Salernitana, open to women like Trota of Salerno and Mercuriade also, considered the most ancient medical institution of the European West, reached its maximum splendour with text like &quot;Trotula&quot;. At this time in the late 11th century, the city was home to 50,000 people.

In 1100, Salerno was made the capital of Norman southern Italy, after Melfi.

Salerno was the most important city of the Normans for half a century, but with the Norman conquest of southern Italy, the city of Palermo started to substitute Salerno as the most important city for the Normans. Indeed, Salerno played a little part in the fall of the County of Sicily, after the Emperor Henry VI&#x27;s invasion on behalf of his wife, Constance, the heiress to the kingdom, in 1191, Salerno surrendered and promised loyalty on the mere news of an incoming army.

This so disgusted the archbishop, Nicolò d&#x27;Aiello (from Naples), that he abandoned the city and fled to Naples, which held out in a siege. In 1194, the situation reversed itself: Naples capitulated, along with most other cities of the Mezzogiorno, and only Salerno resisted. It was sacked and pillaged, much reducing its importance and prosperity.

Henry had his reasons, though. He had entrusted Constance to some important Salerno citizens (advised &amp; &quot;ruled&quot; by the archbishop d&#x27;Aiello) and after his retreat from invasion in 1191 they had received letters about the events from Nicolò D&#x27;Aiello and so betrayed Henry, attacked Constance at Castel Terracena and handed her over to King Tancred of Sicily, making the Empress captive for nearly one year. The combined treachery and stubbornness of D&#x27;Aiello and his followers cost Salerno much after the Hohenstaufen conquest: Henry&#x27;s son, Frederick II, moreover, issued a series of edicts that reduced Salerno&#x27;s role in favour of Naples (in particular, the foundation of the University of Naples in that city).
At Charles II of Naples, his father Charles I of Anjou granted the Principality of Salerno in the Kingdom of Sicily (or Regno) in 1272.

From the 14th century onwards, most of the Salerno province became the territory of the Princes of Sanseverino, powerful feudal lords who acted as real owners of the region. They accumulated enormous political and administrative power and attracted artists and men of letters in their own princely palace. In the 15th century, the city was the scene of battles between the Angevin and the Aragonese royal houses with whom the local lords took sides alternatingly.

In the first decades of the 16th century, the last descendant of the Sanseverino princes, Ferdinando Sanseverino, was in conflict with the viceroy of the king of Spain, mainly because of his opposition to the Inquisition, causing the ruin of the whole family and the beginning of a long period of decadence for the city.

A slow renewal of the city occurred in the 18th century with the end of the Spanish dominion and the construction of many refined houses and churches characterising the main streets of the historical centre. In 1799 Salerno was incorporated into the Parthenopean Republic. During the Napoleonic era, first Joseph Bonaparte and then Joachim Murat ascended the Neapolitan throne. The latter decreed the closing of the Schola Medica Salernitana, which had been declining for decades to the level of a theoretical school. In the same period, even the religious orders were suppressed and numerous ecclesiastical properties were confiscated.

The city expanded beyond the ancient walls and sea connections were potentiated as they represented an important road network that crossed the town connecting the eastern plain with the area leading to Vietri and Naples.

===Late modern and contemporary===
Salerno was an active center of Carbonari activities supporting the unification of Italy in the 19th century. The majority of the population of Salerno supported ideas of the Risorgimento against the Bourbon, and in 1861 many of them joined Garibaldi in his struggle for unification.

After the unification of Italy, a slow urban development continued, many suburban areas were enlarged and large public and private buildings were created. The city went on developing until World War II. Its population rose from 20,000 people around 1861s unification to 80,000 in the early 20th century.

During the 19th century, foreign industries started settling in Salerno: in 1830 the first textile mill was established by the Swiss entrepreneur Züblin Vonwiller, followed by Schlaepfer-Wenner&#x27;s textile mills and dye factories; the Wenner family settled permanently in Salerno. In 1877 the city was the site of as many as 21 textile mills employing around ten thousand workers; in comparison with the four thousand employed in Turin&#x27;s textile industry, Salerno was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Manchester of the two Sicilies&quot;.
In September 1943, during World War II, Salerno was the scene of Operation Avalanche, the invasion of Italy launched by the Allies of World War II, and suffered a great deal of damage. Henry Wellesley, 6th Duke of Wellington, who was killed in action during the fighting, is buried in Salerno War Cemetery. From 12 February to 17 July 1944, it hosted the Government of Marshal Pietro Badoglio. In those months Salerno was the provisional government seat of the Kingdom of Italy, and the King Vittorio Emanuele III lived in a mansion in its outskirts.

After the war the population of the city doubled in a few years, going from 80,000 in 1946 to nearly 160,000 in 1976.

==Geography==
The city is situated at the northwestern end of the plain of the Sele River, at the exact beginning of the Amalfi coast. The small river Irno crosses through the central section of Salerno. The highest point is &quot;Monte Stella&quot; with its .

===Climate===
Salerno has a Mediterranean climate, with a hot and relatively dry summer (highs of in July and August) and a rainy fall and winter (highs of in January). Usually there is nearly of rain every year. The strong wind that comes from the mountains toward the Gulf of Salerno makes the city very windy (mainly in winter). However, this gives Salerno the advantage of being one of the sunniest towns in Italy.
==Demographics==
In 2007, there were 140,580 people residing in Salerno, located in the province of Salerno, Campania, of whom 46.7% were male and 53.3% were female. Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled 19.61 per cent of the population compared to pensioners who number 21.86 per cent. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06 per cent (minors) and 19.94 per cent (pensioners). The average age of Salerno residents is 42 compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Salerno grew by 2.02 per cent, while Italy as a whole grew by 3.85 per cent. The current birth rate of Salerno is 7.77 births per 1,000 inhabitants compared to the Italian average of 9.45 births.

As of 31 December 2010, there were 4,355 foreigners in Salerno. The largest immigrant group came from other European countries (mainly Ukraine and Romania). The population is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic.

==Economy==
The economy of Salerno is mainly based on services and tourism, as most of the city&#x27;s manufacturing base did not survive the economic crisis of the 1970s. The remaining ones are connected to pottery and food production and treatment.

The Port of Salerno is one of the most active of the Tyrrhenian Sea. It handles about 10 million tons of cargo per year, 60% of which is made up by containers.

==Transport==
Salerno is connected to the A2, Autostrada A3 and Autostrada A30 motorways.

Salerno station is the main railway station of the city. It is connected to the high-speed railway network via the Milan-Salerno corridor. The main bus stop of Salerno is also at the train station, with both CSTP buses and SITA buses.

A metro light rail line connects the train station with Stadio Arechi, with seven intermediate stops.

A new Maritime Terminal Station, designed by Zaha Hadid Architects, was completed in 2016 and was opened for the 2017 cruise season. Salerno features three marinas: Manfredi Pier, Masuccio Salernitano, and Marina di Arechi (opened in 2015). The commercial port of Manfredi is connected with the Amalfi coast and the islands of Gulf of Naples.

Salerno Airport is located in the neighboring towns of Pontecagnano Faiano and Bellizzi.

==Education==
Salerno hosted the oldest medical school in the world, the Scuola Medica Salernitana, the most important source of medical knowledge in Europe in the early Middle Ages. It was closed in 1811 by Joachim Murat.

In 1944 king Vittorio Emanuele III established Istituto Universitario di Magistero &quot;Giovanni Cuomo&quot;. In 1968 the university became state-controlled. Today University of Salerno is located in the neighboring town of Fisciano and has about 34,000 students and ten faculties: Arts and Philosophy, Economics, Education, Engineering, Foreign language and literature, Law, Mathematics, Physics and Natural Sciences, Medicine, Pharmacy and Political Science.

The city has also a tradition in motorsport.

==Attractions==
Salerno is located at the geographical center of a triangle nicknamed &quot;Tourist Triangle of the 3 P&#x27;s&quot; (namely a triangle with the corners in Pompei, Paestum and Positano). This peculiarity gives Salerno special tourist characteristics that are increased by the many local points of tourist interest like the &quot;Lungomare Trieste&quot; (&quot;Trieste Seafront Promenade&quot;), the &quot;Castello di Arechi&quot; (&quot;Arechis&#x27; Castle&quot;), the &quot;Duomo&quot; (cathedral) and the &quot;Museo Didattico della Scuola Medica Salernitana&quot; (&quot;Educational Museum of the Salernitan Medical School&quot;).

<text>John Burdon Sanderson Haldane (; 5 November 18921 December 1964), nicknamed &quot;Jack&quot; or &quot;JBS&quot;, was a British-born scientist who later moved to India and acquired Indian citizenship. He worked in the fields of physiology, genetics, evolutionary biology, and mathematics. With innovative use of statistics in biology, he was one of the founders of neo-Darwinism. Despite his lack of an academic degree in the field, he taught biology at the University of Cambridge, the Royal Institution, and University College London. Renouncing his British citizenship, he became an Indian citizen in 1961 and worked at the Indian Statistical Institute until his death in 1964.

Haldane&#x27;s article on abiogenesis in 1929 introduced the &quot;primordial soup theory&quot;, which became the foundation for the concept of the chemical origin of life. He established human gene maps for haemophilia and colour blindness on the X chromosome, and codified Haldane&#x27;s rule on sterility in the heterogametic sex of hybrids in species. He correctly proposed that sickle-cell disease confers some immunity to malaria. He was the first to suggest the central idea of in vitro fertilisation, as well as concepts such as hydrogen economy, cis and trans-acting regulation, coupling reaction, molecular repulsion, the darwin (as a unit of evolution), and organismal cloning.

In 1957, Haldane articulated Haldane&#x27;s dilemma, a limit on the speed of beneficial evolution, an idea that is still debated today. He is also remembered for his work in human biology, having coined &quot;clone&quot;, &quot;cloning&quot;, and &quot;ectogenesis&quot;. With his sister, Naomi Mitchison, Haldane was the first to demonstrate genetic linkage in mammals. Subsequent works established a unification of Mendelian genetics and Darwinian evolution by natural selection whilst laying the groundwork for modern synthesis, and helped to create population genetics.

Haldane served in the Great War, and obtained the rank of captain. He was a professed socialist, Marxist, atheist, and secular humanist whose political dissent led him to leave England in 1956 and live in India, becoming a naturalised Indian citizen in 1961. Arthur C. Clarke credited him as &quot;perhaps the most brilliant science populariser of his generation&quot;. Brazilian-British biologist and Nobel laureate Peter Medawar called Haldane &quot;the cleverest man I ever knew&quot;. According to Theodosius Dobzhansky, &quot;Haldane was always recognized as a singular case&quot;; Ernst Mayr described him as a &quot;polymath&quot; (as did others); Michael J. D. White described him as &quot;the most erudite biologist of his generation, and perhaps of the century&quot;; James Watson described him as &quot;England&#x27;s most clever and eccentric biologist&quot;, and Sahotra Sarkar described him as &quot;probably the most prescient biologist of this [20th] century&quot;. According to a Cambridge student, &quot;he seemed to be the last man who might know all there was to be known&quot;. He willed his body for medical studies, as he wanted to remain useful even in death.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===

Haldane was born in Oxford in 1892. His father was the Scottish physiologist, scientist, philosopher, and Liberal, John Scott Haldane, who was the grandson of evangelist James Alexander Haldane. His mother Louisa Kathleen Trotter, was a Conservative of Scottish ancestry. His only sibling, Naomi Mitchison, became a prominent Scottish writer. His uncle was Viscount Haldane and his aunt was the author Elizabeth Haldane. Descended from an aristocratic and secular family of the Clan Haldane, he later claimed that his Y chromosome could be traced back to Robert the Bruce.

Haldane grew up at 11 Crick Road, North Oxford. He learnt to read at the age of three, and at four, after injuring his forehead, he asked the physician treating him about the bleeding, &quot;Is this oxyhaemoglobin or carboxyhaemoglobin?&quot; He was raised as an Anglican Christian. From age eight he worked with his father in their home laboratory where he experienced his first self-experimentation, the method he would later be famous for. He and his father became their own &quot;human guinea pigs&quot;, such as in their investigation on the effects of poison gases. In 1899, his family moved to &quot;Cherwell&quot;, a late Victorian house at the outskirts of Oxford with its own private laboratory. At age 8, in 1901, his father brought him to the Oxford University Junior Scientific Club to listen to a lecture on Mendelian genetics, which had been recently rediscovered. Although he found the lecture given by Arthur Dukinfield Darbishire, Demonstrator of Zoology at Balliol College, Oxford, &quot;interesting but difficult&quot;, it influenced him permanently such that genetics became the field in which he made his most important scientific contributions.

His formal education began in 1897 at Oxford Preparatory School (now Dragon School), where he gained a First Scholarship in 1904 to Eton College. In 1905 he joined Eton, where he experienced severe abuse from senior students for allegedly being arrogant, but was befriended by Julian Huxley. The indifference of authority left him with a lasting hatred for the English education system. However, the ordeal did not stop him from becoming captain of the school.

He participated for the first time in scientific research as a volunteer subject for his father in 1906. John was the first to study the effects of decompression (relief from high pressure) in humans. He investigated the physiological condition called &quot;bends&quot;, such as when goats lift and bend their legs if discomforted, that also may affect deep-sea divers. In July 1906, on board &quot;HMS Spanker&quot; off the west coast of Scotland, Rothesay, young Haldane jumped into the Atlantic Ocean with the experimental diving suit. The study was published in a 101-paged article in &quot;The Journal of Hygiene&quot; in 1908; where Haldane was described as &quot;Jack Haldane (age 13)&quot; for whom it &quot;was the first time [he] had ever dived in a diving dress&quot;. The research became a foundation for a scientific theory called Haldane&#x27;s decompression model.

He studied mathematics and classics at New College, Oxford, and obtained first-class honours in mathematical Moderations in 1912. He became engrossed in genetics and presented a paper on gene linkage in vertebrates in the summer of 1912. His first technical paper, a 30-page long article on haemoglobin function, was published that same year, as a co-author alongside his father. His mathematical treatment of the study was published in December 1913 in the &quot;Proceedings of the Physiological Society&quot;.

Haldane did not want his education to be confined to a specific subject; he took up Greats (classics) and graduated with first-class honours in 1914. While he had full intention of studying physiology, his plan was, as he described later, referring to World War I, &quot;somewhat overshadowed by other events&quot;. His only formal education in biology was an incomplete course in vertebrate anatomy.

=== Career ===

To support the war effort, Haldane volunteered to join the British Army, and was commissioned a temporary second lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion of the Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment) on 15 August 1914. He was assigned as the trench mortar officer, to lead his team for hand-bombing the enemy trenches, the experience of which he described as &quot;enjoyable&quot;. In his article in 1932 he described how &quot;he enjoyed the opportunity of killing people and regarded this as a respectable relic of primitive man&quot;. He was promoted to temporary lieutenant on 18 February 1915 and to temporary captain on 18 October. While serving in France, he was wounded by artillery fire and sent back to Scotland, where he served as instructor of grenades for the Black Watch recruits. In 1916, he joined the war in Mesopotamia (Iraq), where an enemy bomb severely wounded him. He was relieved from the theatre of war and sent to India, where he stayed for the rest of the war. He returned to England in 1919 and relinquished his commission on 1 April 1920, retaining his rank of captain. For his ferocity and aggressiveness in battles, his commander described him as the &quot;bravest and dirtiest officer in my Army&quot;. Another senior officer of his regiment called him &#x27;mad&#x27; and &#x27;cracked&#x27;.

Between 1919 and 1922, he served as Fellow of New College, Oxford, where, despite his lack of formal education in the field, he taught and researched in physiology and genetics. During his first year at Oxford, six of his papers dealing with physiology of respiration and genetics were published. He then moved to the University of Cambridge, where he accepted a newly created readership in biochemistry in 1923 and taught until 1932. During his nine years at Cambridge, he worked on enzymes and genetics, particularly the mathematical side of genetics. While working as a visiting professor at the University of California in 1932, he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society.

Haldane worked part-time at the John Innes Horticultural Institution (later named John Innes Centre) at Merton Park in Surrey from 1927 to 1937. When Alfred Daniel Hall became the director in 1926, one of his earliest tasks was to appoint as assistant director &quot;a man of high quality in the study of genetics&quot; who could become his successor. Upon the recommendation of Julian Huxley, the council appointed Haldane in March 1927, with the terms: &quot;Mr. Haldane to visit the Institution fortnightly for a day and a night during the Cambridge terms, to put in two months also at Easter and long vacations in two continuous blocks and to be free in the Christmas vacation.&quot; He was officer in charge of Genetical Investigations. He became the Fullerian Professor of Physiology at the Royal Institution from 1930 to 1932 and in 1933 he became Professor of Genetics at University College London, where he spent most of his academic career. As Hall did not retire until 1939, Haldane did not in fact succeed him, but resigned from the John Innes in 1936 to become the first Weldon Professor of biometry at University College London. Haldane was credited with helping the John Innes become &quot;the liveliest place for research in genetics in Britain&quot;. He moved his team to the Rothamsted Experimental Station in Hertfordshire from 1941 to 1944, during World War II, to escape bombings. Reginald Punnett, founder of the &quot;Journal of Genetics&quot; in 1910 with William Bateson, invited him to become editor in 1933, a post he retained until his death.

=== In India ===

In 1956, Haldane left University College London, and joined the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) in Calcutta (later renamed Kolkata), India, where he worked in the biometry unit. Haldane gave many reasons for moving to India. Officially he stated that he left the UK because of the Suez Crisis, writing: &quot;Finally, I am going to India because I consider that recent acts of the British Government have been violations of international law.&quot; He believed that the warm climate would do him good, and that India shared his socialist dreams. In an article &quot;A passage to India&quot; that he wrote in &quot;The Rationalists Annual&quot; in 1958, he stated: &quot;For one thing I prefer Indian food to American. Perhaps my main reason for going to India is that I consider that the opportunities for scientific research of the kind in which I am interested are better in India than in Britain, and that my teaching will be at least as useful there as here.&quot; The university had sacked his wife Helen for being drunk and disorderly and refusing to pay a fine, triggering Haldane&#x27;s resignation. He declared he would no longer wear socks, &quot;Sixty years in socks is enough.&quot; and he always dressed in Indian attire.

Haldane was keenly interested in inexpensive research. Explaining in &quot;A passage to India&quot;, he said, &quot;Of course, if my work required electron microscopes, cyclotrons, and the like, I should not get them in India. But the sort of facilities which Darwin and Bateson used for their researches—such as gardens, gardeners, pigeon lofts, and pigeons—are more easily obtained in India than in England.&quot; He wrote to Julian Huxley about his observations on &quot;Vanellus malabaricus&quot;, the yellow-wattled lapwing. He advocated the use of &quot;Vigna sinensis&quot; (cowpea) as a model for studying plant genetics. He took an interest in the pollination of &quot;Lantana camara&quot;. He lamented that Indian universities forced those who took up biology to drop mathematics. He took an interest in the study of floral symmetry. In January 1961 he befriended Canadian lepidopterist Gary Botting, the 1960 U.S. Science Fair winner in zoology (who had first visited the Haldanes along with Susan Brown, 1960 U.S. National Science Fair winner in botany), inviting him to share the results of his experiments hybridising &quot;Antheraea&quot; silk moths. He, his wife Helen Spurway, and student Krishna Dronamraju were present at the Oberoi Grand Hotel in Calcutta when Brown reminded the Haldanes that she and Botting had a previously scheduled event that would prevent them from accepting an invitation to a banquet proposed by the Haldanes in their honour and had regretfully declined the honour. After the two students had left the hotel, Haldane went on his much-publicized hunger strike to protest what he regarded as a &quot;U.S. insult&quot;. When the director of the ISI, P. C. Mahalanobis, confronted Haldane about both the hunger strike and the unbudgeted banquet, Haldane resigned from his post (in February 1961), and moved to a newly established biometry unit in Bhubaneswar, the capital of Orissa (Odisha).

Haldane took Indian citizenship; he was interested in Hinduism and became a vegetarian. In 1961, Haldane described India as &quot;the closest approximation to the Free World&quot;. Jerzy Neyman objected that &quot;India has its fair share of scoundrels and a tremendous amount of poor unthinking and disgustingly subservient individuals who are not attractive.&quot; Haldane retorted:Perhaps one is freer to be a scoundrel in India than elsewhere. So one was in the U.S.A in the days of people like Jay Gould, when (in my opinion) there was more internal freedom in the U.S.A than there is today. The &quot;disgusting subservience&quot; of the others has its limits. The people of Calcutta riot, upset trams, and refuse to obey police regulations, in a manner which would have delighted Jefferson. I don&#x27;t think their activities are very efficient, but that is not the question at issue.When on 25 June 1962 he was described in print as a &quot;Citizen of the World&quot; by Groff Conklin, Haldane responded:No doubt I am in some sense a citizen of the world. But I believe with Thomas Jefferson that one of the chief duties of a citizen is to be a nuisance to the government of his state. As there is no world state, I cannot do this. On the other hand, I can be, and am, a nuisance to the government of India, which has the merit of permitting a good deal of criticism, though it reacts to it rather slowly. I also happen to be proud of being a citizen of India, which is a lot more diverse than Europe, let alone the U.S.A, the U.S.S.R or China, and thus a better model for a possible world organisation. It may of course break up, but it is a wonderful experiment. So, I want to be labeled as a citizen of India.

=== Personal life ===

Haldane was married twice, first to Charlotte Franken and then to Helen Spurway. In 1924, Haldane met Charlotte Franken, who was a journalist for the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and married to Jack Burghes. Following the publication of Haldane&#x27;s &quot;Daedalus, or Science and the Future&quot;, she interviewed Haldane and they began a relationship. In order to marry Haldane, Franken filed a divorce suit, which resulted in controversy as Haldane was involved as co-respondent in the legal proceeding. Additionally, as Sahotra Sarkar reported: &quot;For her to secure a divorce, Haldane overtly committed adultery with her&quot;. Haldane&#x27;s conduct was described as &quot;gross immorality&quot;, for which he was formally dismissed by Cambridge&#x27;s Sex Viri (a six-member disciplinary committee) from the university in 1925. Cambridge professors, including G. K. Chesterton, Bertrand Russell, and W. L. George, raised their defence for Haldane insisting that the university should not make such judgements, based solely on a professor&#x27;s private life. The ouster was revoked in 1926. Haldane and Charlotte Franken were married in 1926. Following their separation in 1942, they divorced in 1945. Later that year he married Helen Spurway, his former PhD student. He also had an affair with Angel Records founder Dorle Soria.

Haldane once boasted about himself, saying, &quot;I can read 11 languages and make public speeches in three; but am unmusical. I am a fairly competent public speaker.&quot; He had no children, but he and his father were important influences to his sister Naomi&#x27;s children, of whom Denis Mitchison, Murdoch Mitchison, and Avrion Mitchison became professors of biology at the University of London, Edinburgh University, and University College London, respectively.

Inspired by his father, Haldane often used self-experimentation and would expose himself to danger in order to obtain data. To test the effects of acidification of the blood he drank dilute hydrochloric acid, enclosed himself in an airtight room containing 7% carbon dioxide, and found that it &#x27;gives one a rather violent headache&#x27;. One experiment to study elevated levels of oxygen saturation triggered a fit that resulted in his suffering crushed vertebrae. In his decompression chamber experiments, he and his volunteers suffered perforated eardrums. But, as Haldane stated in &quot;What is Life&quot;, &quot;the drum generally heals up; and if a hole remains in it, although one is somewhat deaf, one can blow tobacco smoke out of the ear in question, which is a social accomplishment&quot;.

Haldane made himself unpopular among his colleagues from the start of his academic career. In Cambridge, he annoyed most of the senior faculty due to his uninhibited behaviour, particularly at dinner. His partisan, Edgar Adrian (a 1932 Nobel laureate), had almost convinced Trinity College to offer him an appointment as a Fellow, but that was ruined by an incident when Haldane arrived at the dining table carrying a gallon jar of urine from his laboratory.

=== Later life and death ===
In the autumn of 1963, Haldane visited the US for a series of scientific conferences. At the University of Wisconsin, Sewall Wright introduced him before his speech, noting many of Haldane&#x27;s achievements, after which Haldane modestly remarked that the introduction would have been more accurate if all the references to &quot;Haldane&quot; were replaced with &quot;Wright&quot;. In Florida, he met, for the first and only time, the Russian biochemist Alexander Oparin, who had developed an origin of life theory quite independent of his own in the 1920s. It was while there that he started feeling abdominal pains.

Haldane went to London for a diagnosis. He was found to have colorectal cancer, and had a surgery in February 1964. Around that time Philip Dally was making a BBC documentary about eminent living scientists, which included Sewall Wright and the double Nobel laureate Linus Pauling. Dally&#x27;s team approached Haldane at the hospital for the documentary profile, but instead of a filmed interview, Haldane gave them a self-obituary, the opening lines of which run:I am going to begin with a boast. I believe that I am one of the [originally as &quot;I am the most&quot;] most influential people living today, although I haven&#x27;t got a scrap of power. Let me explain. In 1932 I was the first person to estimate the rate of mutation of a human gene.He also wrote a comic poem while in the hospital, mocking his own incurable disease. It was read by his friends, who appreciated the consistent irreverence with which Haldane had lived his life. The poem first appeared in print on 21 February 1964 issue of the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, and runs:
The poem ends:
He willed that his body be used for medical research and instruction at the Rangaraya Medical College, Kakinada. 

His surgery in London was declared successful. But the symptoms reappeared after returning to India in June, and in August, the Indian doctors confirmed that his condition was terminal. Writing to John Maynard Smith on 7 September, he said, &quot;I am not appreciably upset by the prospect of dying fairly soon. But I am very angry [at the English doctor who performed the operation].&quot;

He died on 1 December 1964 in Bhubaneswar. On that day the BBC broadcast his self-obituary as &quot;Professor J.B.S. Haldane, obituary.&quot; Following his will, his body was moved to Kakinada where Vissa Ramachandra Rao performed post-mortem and preservation of his body parts. His skeleton and organs are on display to the public in the Haldane Museum, located in the pathology department of Rangaraya Medical College.

== Scientific contributions ==

Following his father&#x27;s footsteps, Haldane&#x27;s first publication was on the mechanism of gaseous exchange by haemoglobin in &quot;The Journal of Physiology&quot;, and he subsequently worked on the chemical properties of blood as a pH buffer. He investigated several aspects of kidney functions and mechanism of excretion.

=== Genetic linkage ===

In 1904, Arthur Dukinfield Darbishire published a paper on an experiment attempting to test Mendelian inheritance between Japanese waltzing and albino mice. When Haldane came across the paper, he noticed that Darbishire had overlooked the possibility of genetic linkage in the experiment. Having sought advice from Reginald Punnett, a professor of biology at the University of Cambridge, he was ready to write a paper, but only after an independent experiment. With his sister Naomi and a friend one year his senior, Alexander Dalzell Sprunt, he started the experiment in 1908 using guinea pigs and mice. By 1912, the report was ready. The paper was entitled &quot;Reduplication in mice&quot; and published in the &quot;Journal of Genetics&quot; only in December 1915. It became the first demonstration of genetic linkage in mammals, showing that certain genetic traits tend to be inherited together (this was later discovered to be due to their proximity on chromosomes). (Between 1912 and 1914, genetic linkage had been reported in the fruit fly &quot;Drosophilla&quot;, silk moth, and plants.)

As the paper was written during Haldane&#x27;s service during World War I, James F. Crow called it &quot;the most important science article ever written in a front-line trench&quot;. Haldane recalled that he was the &quot;only officer to complete a scientific paper from a forward position of the Black Watch&quot;. As was Haldane, Sprunt had joined 4th Battalion Bedfordshire Regiment at the start of World War I, and was killed at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle on 17 March 1915. It was upon this news that Haldane submitted the paper for publication, in which he remarked: &quot;Owing to the war it has been necessary to publish prematurely, as unfortunately one of us (A. D. S.) has already been killed in France.&quot; He was also the first to demonstrate linkage in chickens in 1921, and (with Julia Bell) in humans in 1937.

=== Enzyme kinetics ===

In 1925, with G.E. Briggs, Haldane derived a new interpretation of the enzyme kinetic law of Victor Henri in 1903, better known as the 1913 Michaelis–Menten equation. Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten assumed that enzyme (catalyst) and substrate (reactant) are in fast equilibrium with their complex, which then dissociates to yield product and free enzyme. By contrast, at almost the same time, Donald Van Slyke and G. E. Cullen treated the binding step as an irreversible reaction. The Briggs–Haldane equation was of the same algebraic form as both of the earlier equations, but their derivation is based on the quasi-steady state approximation, which is the concentration of intermediate complex (or complexes) does not change. As a result, the microscopic meaning of the &quot;Michaelis Constant&quot; (&quot;Km&quot;) is different. Although commonly referring to it as Michaelis–Menten kinetics, most of the current models typically use the Briggs–Haldane derivation.

=== Haldane&#x27;s principle ===

In his essay &quot;On Being the Right Size&quot; he outlines Haldane&#x27;s principle, which states that the size very often defines what bodily equipment an animal must have: &quot;Insects, being so small, do not have oxygen-carrying bloodstreams. What little oxygen their cells require can be absorbed by simple diffusion of air through their bodies. But being larger means an animal must have complicated oxygen pumping and distributing systems to reach all the cells.&quot;

=== Haldane&#x27;s sieve ===

In 1927, Haldane pointed out that because selection mainly acts on heterozygotes, newly arisen dominant mutations are much more likely to be fixed, than are recessive ones, a mechanism now called &quot;Haldane&#x27;s sieve&quot;. This leads to the expectation that adaptation from new mutations in large outcrossing populations should primarily proceed via fixing non-recessive beneficial mutations.

=== Origin of life ===
In 1929, Haldane introduced the modern concept of abiogenesis in an eight-page article entitled &quot;The Origin of Life&quot; in &quot;The Rationalist Annual&quot;, describing the primitive ocean as a &quot;vast chemical laboratory&quot; containing a mixture of inorganic compounds – like a &quot;hot dilute soup&quot; in which organic compounds could have formed. Under the solar energy the anoxic atmosphere containing carbon dioxide, ammonia, and water vapour gave rise to a variety of organic compounds, &quot;living or half-living things&quot;. The first molecules reacted with one another to produce more complex compounds, and ultimately the cellular components. At some point a kind of &quot;oily film&quot; was produced that enclosed self-replicating nucleic acids, thereby becoming the first cell. J. D. Bernal named the hypothesis &quot;biopoiesis&quot; or &quot;biopoesis&quot;, the process of living matter spontaneously evolving from self-replicating, but lifeless molecules. Haldane further hypothesised that viruses were the intermediate entities between the prebiotic soup and the first cells. He asserted that prebiotic life would have been &quot;in the virus stage for many millions of years before a suitable assemblage of elementary units was brought together in the first cell&quot;. The idea was generally dismissed as &quot;wild speculation&quot;.

Alexander Oparin had suggested a similar idea in Russian in 1924 (published in English in 1936). The hypothesis gained some empirical support in 1953 with the classic Miller–Urey experiment. Since then, the primordial soup theory (Oparin–Haldane hypothesis) has become the foundation in the study of abiogenesis.

Although Oparin&#x27;s theory became widely known only after the English version in 1936, Haldane accepted Oparin&#x27;s originality and said, &quot;I have very little doubt that Professor Oparin has the priority over me.&quot;

=== Malaria and sickle-cell anemia ===

Haldane was the first to realise the evolutionary link between genetic disorder and infection in humans. While estimating the rates of human mutation in different situations and diseases, he noted that mutations expressed in red blood cells, such as thalassemias, were prevalent only in tropical regions where deadly infection such as malaria has been endemic. He further observed that these were favourable traits (heterozygous inheritance of sickle cell trait) for natural selection that protected individuals from receiving malarial infection. He introduced his hypothesis at the Eighth International Congress of Genetics held in 1948 at Stockholm on a topic &quot;The Rate of Mutation of Human Genes&quot;. He proposed that genetic disorders in humans living in malaria-endemic regions provided a condition (phenotype) that makes them relatively immune to malarial infections. He formalised the concept in a technical paper published in 1949 in which he made a prophetic statement: &quot;The corpuscles of the anaemic heterozygotes are smaller than normal, and more resistant to hypotonic solutions. It is at least conceivable that they are also more resistant to attacks by the sporozoa which cause malaria.&quot; This became known as &quot;Haldane&#x27;s malaria hypothesis&quot;, or concisely, the &quot;malaria hypothesis&quot;. This hypothesis was eventually confirmed by Anthony C. Allison in 1954 in the case of sickle-cell anemia.

=== Population genetics ===
Haldane was one of the three major figures to develop the mathematical theory of population genetics, along with Ronald Fisher and Sewall Wright. He thus played an important role in the modern evolutionary synthesis of the early 20th century. He re-established natural selection as the central mechanism of evolution by explaining it as a mathematical consequence of Mendelian inheritance. He wrote a series of ten papers, A Mathematical Theory of Natural and Artificial Selection, deriving expressions for the direction and rate of change of gene frequencies, and also analyzing the interaction of natural selection with mutation and migration. The series consists of ten papers published between 1924 and 1934 in journals such as &quot;Biological Reviews&quot; (part II), &quot;Mathematical Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society&quot; (parts I and from III to IX), and &quot;Genetics&quot; (part X). He gave a set of lectures based on this series at the University of Wales in 1931, and they were summarised in his book, &quot;The Causes of Evolution&quot; in 1932.

His first paper on the series in 1924 specifically deals with the rate of natural selection in peppered moth evolution. He predicted that environmental conditions can favour the increase or decline of either the dominant (in this case the black or melanic forms) or the recessive (the grey or wild type) moths. For a sooty environment such as Manchester, where the phenomenon was discovered in 1848, he predicted that the &quot;fertility of the dominants must be 50% greater than that of the recessives&quot;. According to his estimate, assuming 1% dominant form in 1848 and about 99% in 1898, &quot;48 generations are needed for the change [for the dominant to appear]... After only 13 generations the dominants would be in a majority.&quot; Such mathematical prediction was considered improbable for natural selection in nature, but it was subsequently proven by an elaborate experiment (named Kettlewell&#x27;s experiment) that was performed by an Oxford zoologist Bernard Kettlewell between 1953 and 1958. Haldane&#x27;s prediction was proven further by a Cambridge geneticist Michael Majerus in his experiments conducted between 2001 and 2007.

His contributions to statistical human genetics included: the first methods using maximum likelihood for the estimation of human linkage maps; pioneering methods for estimating human mutation rates; the first estimates of mutation rate in humans (2 × 10−5 mutations per gene per generation for the X-linked haemophilia gene); and the first notion that there is a &quot;cost of natural selection&quot;. He was the first to estimate the rate of human mutation in his 1932 book entitled &quot;The Causes of Evolution&quot;. At the John Innes Horticultural Institution, he developed the complicated linkage theory for polyploids; and extended the idea of gene-enzyme relationships with the biochemical and genetic study of plant pigments.

== Political views ==
Haldane became a socialist during the First World War, supported the Second Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War, and then became an open supporter of the Communist Party of Great Britain in 1937. A pragmatic dialectical-materialist Marxist, he wrote many articles for the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;. In &quot;On Being the Right Size&quot;, he wrote that &quot;while nationalization of certain industries is an obvious possibility in the largest of states, I find it no easier to picture a completely socialized British Empire or United States than an elephant turning somersaults or a hippopotamus jumping a hedge&quot;.
In 1938, Haldane proclaimed enthusiastically: &quot;I think that Marxism is true.&quot; He joined the Communist Party in 1942. He was pressed to speak out about the rise of Lysenkoism and the persecution of geneticists in the Soviet Union as anti-Darwinist and the political suppression of genetics as incompatible with dialectical materialism. He shifted his polemic focus to the United Kingdom, criticizing the dependence of scientific research on financial patronage. In 1941, he wrote about the Soviet trial of his friend and fellow geneticist, Nikolai Vavilov:

By the end of the Second World War, Haldane had become an explicit critic of the Soviet regime. He left the party in 1950, shortly after considering standing for Parliament as a Communist Party candidate. He continued to admire Joseph Stalin, describing him in 1962 as &quot;a very great man who did a very good job&quot;. Haldane has been accused by authors including Peter Wright and Chapman Pincher of having been a Soviet GRU spy codenamed &quot;Intelligentsia&quot;.

== Social and scientific views ==

=== Human cloning ===
Haldane was the first to have thought of the genetic basis for human cloning, and the eventual artificial breeding of superior individuals. For this he introduced the terms &quot;clone&quot; and &quot;cloning&quot;, modifying the earlier &quot;clon&quot; that had been used in agriculture since the early 20th century (from Greek &quot;klōn&quot;, twig). He introduced the term in his speech on &quot;Biological Possibilities for the Human Species of the Next Ten Thousand Years&quot; at the &quot;Ciba Foundation Symposium on Man and his Future&quot; in 1963. He said:
=== Ectogenesis and in vitro fertilisation ===

His essay &quot;Daedalus; or, Science and the Future&quot; (1924) posited the concept of in vitro fertilisation, which he called ectogenesis. He envisioned ectogenesis as a tool for creating better individuals (eugenics). Haldane&#x27;s work was an influence on Huxley&#x27;s &quot;Brave New World&quot; (1932) and was also admired by Gerald Heard. Various essays on science were collected and published in a volume entitled &quot;Possible Worlds&quot; in 1927. His book, &quot;A.R.P. (Air Raid Precautions)&quot; (1938) combined his physiological research into the effects of stress upon the human body with his experience of air raids during the Spanish Civil War to provide a scientific account of the likely effects of the air raids that Britain was to endure during the Second World War.

=== Criticism of C. S. Lewis ===
Along with Olaf Stapledon, Charles Kay Ogden, I. A. Richards, and H. G. Wells, Haldane was accused by C. S. Lewis of scientism. Haldane criticised Lewis and his Ransom Trilogy for the &quot;complete mischaracterisation of science, and his disparagement of the human race&quot;. Haldane wrote a book for children entitled &quot;My Friend Mr. Leakey&quot; (1937), containing the stories &quot;A Meal With a Magician&quot;, &quot;A Day in the Life of a Magician&quot;, &quot;Mr. Leakey&#x27;s Party&quot;, &quot;Rats&quot;, &quot;The Snake with the Golden Teeth&quot;, and &quot;My Magic Collar Stud&quot;. Later editions featured illustrations by Quentin Blake. Haldane also wrote an essay criticising Lewis&#x27;s arguments for the existence of God, entitled &quot;More Anti-Lewisite&quot;, a reference to the poison gas and its antidote.

=== Hydrogen-generating windmills ===
In 1923, in a talk given in Cambridge entitled &quot;Science and the Future&quot;, Haldane, foreseeing the exhaustion of coal for power generation in Britain, proposed a network of hydrogen-generating windmills. This is the first proposal of the hydrogen-based renewable energy economy.

=== Scientists ===
In his &quot;An Autobiography in Brief&quot;, published shortly before his death in India, Haldane named four close associates as showing promise to become illustrious scientists: T. A. Davis, Dronamraju Krishna Rao, Suresh Jayakar, and S. K. Roy.

== Awards and honours ==

Haldane was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1932. The French Government conferred him its National Order of the Legion of Honour in 1937. In 1952, he received the Darwin Medal from the Royal Society. In 1956, he was awarded the Huxley Memorial Medal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain. He received the Feltrinelli Prize from Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei in 1961. He also received an Honorary Doctorate of Science, an Honorary Fellowship at New College, Oxford, and the Kimber Award of the National Academy of Sciences in the United States. He was awarded the Linnean Society of London&#x27;s prestigious Darwin–Wallace Medal in 1958.

=== Legacy ===
The Haldane Lecture at the John Innes Centre, where Haldane worked from 1927 to 1937 is named in his honour. The JBS Haldane Lecture of The Genetics Society is named in his honour as well.

In the novel &quot;Antic Hay&quot; (1923) Haldane was parodied by his friend Aldous Huxley as an obsessive self-experimenter described as &quot;the biologist too absorbed in his experiments to notice his friends bedding his wife&quot;.

== Quotations ==
* He is famous for the (possibly apocryphal) response that he gave when some theologians asked him what could be inferred about the mind of the Creator from the works of His Creation: &quot;an inordinate fondness for beetles&quot;, or sometimes he would respond: &quot;an inordinate fondness for stars and beetles&quot;.
* &quot;My own suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we &quot;can&quot; suppose.&quot;
* &quot;It seems to me immensely unlikely that mind is a mere by-product of matter. For if my mental processes are determined wholly by the motions of atoms in my brain I have no reason to suppose that my beliefs are true. They may be sound chemically, but that does not make them sound logically. And hence I have no reason for supposing my brain to be composed of atoms.&quot;
* &quot;Teleology is like a mistress to a biologist: he cannot live without her but he&#x27;s unwilling to be seen with her in public.&quot;
* &quot;I had gastritis for about fifteen years until I read Lenin and other writers, who showed me what was wrong with our society and how to cure it. Since then I have needed no magnesia.&quot;
* &quot;I suppose the process of acceptance will pass through the usual four stages: (i) This is worthless nonsense; (ii) This is an interesting, but perverse, point of view; (iii) This is true, but quite unimportant; (iv) I always said so.&quot;
* &quot;Three hundred and ten species in all of India, representing two hundred and thirty-eight genera, sixty-two families, nineteen different orders. All of them on the Ark. And this is only India, and only the &quot;birds&quot;.&quot;
* &quot;The stupidity of the &quot;mynah&quot; shows that in birds, as in men, linguistic and practical abilities are not very highly correlated. A student who can repeat a page of a text book may get first class honours, but may be incapable of doing research.&quot;
* When asked whether he would lay down his life for his brother, Haldane, presaging Hamilton&#x27;s rule, supposedly replied, &quot;two brothers or eight cousins&quot;.

<doc id="62418" wikidata="Q279" url="?curid=62418" title="Modena">
<text>Modena (, ; ; ; ; ) is a city and &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) on the south side of the Po Valley, in the Province of Modena, in the Emilia-Romagna region of northern Italy.

A town, and seat of an archbishop, it is known for its car industry since the factories of the famous Italian upper-class sports car makers Ferrari, De Tomaso, Lamborghini, Pagani and Maserati are, or were, located there and all, except Lamborghini, (having their factory in Sant&#x27;Agata Bolognese), have headquarters in the city or nearby. One of Ferrari&#x27;s cars, the 360 Modena, was named after the town itself. Ferrari&#x27;s production plant and Formula One team Scuderia Ferrari are based in Maranello south of the city.

The University of Modena, founded in 1175 and expanded by Francesco II d&#x27;Este in 1686, focuses on economics, medicine and law, and is the second oldest athenaeum in Italy. Italian military officers are trained at the Military Academy of Modena, and partly housed in the Baroque Ducal Palace. The Biblioteca Estense houses historical volumes and 3,000 manuscripts. The Cathedral of Modena, the Torre della Ghirlandina and Piazza Grande are a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1997. Modena is also known in culinary circles for its production of balsamic vinegar.

Famous &quot;Modenesi&quot; include Mary of Modena, the Queen consort of England and Scotland; operatic tenor Luciano Pavarotti and soprano Mirella Freni, born in Modena itself; Enzo Ferrari, eponymous founder of the Ferrari motor company; Catholic priest Gabriele Amorth; chef Massimo Bottura; comics artist Franco Bonvicini; the band Modena City Ramblers and singer-songwriter Francesco Guccini, who lived here for several decades.

==Geography==
Modena lies on the Pianura Padana, and is bounded by the two rivers Secchia and Panaro, both affluents of the Po River. Their presence is symbolized by the Two Rivers Fountain in the city&#x27;s center, by Giuseppe Graziosi. The city is connected to the Panaro by the Naviglio channel. The Apennines begin some from the city, to the south. The comune is divided into four &quot;circoscrizioni&quot;. These are:
* Centro storico (Historical Center, San Cataldo)
* Crocetta (San Lazzaro-East Modena, Crocetta)
* Buon Pastore (Buon Pastore, Sant&#x27;Agnese, San Damaso)
* San Faustino (S.Faustino-Saliceta San Giuliano, Madonnina-Quattro Ville)

=== Climate ===
Modena has a humid subtropical climate, with continental influences. It has an average annual precipitation of . Summers are hot and winters are cool, with snowfall. This climate is described by the Köppen climate classification as &quot;Cfa&quot;.

==Municipal administration==

From 1946 to 1992, Modena had a series of Communist mayors. From the 1990s, the city has been governed by center-left coalitions. The legislative body of the municipality (&quot;comune&quot;) is the City Council (), which is composed by 32 members elected (jointly with the mayor) by the citizens every five years. Modena&#x27;s executive body is the City Committee (&quot;Giunta Comunale&quot;), which is composed by 9 assessors (appointed and dismissed by the mayor), of which one is deputy-mayor, and the mayor. The mayor from 2019 to 2024 of Modena was Gian Carlo Muzzarelli, a member of the Democratic Party.

==History==
===Ancient times===

The territory around Modena (, ) was inhabited by the Villanovans in the Iron Age, and later by Ligurian tribes, Etruscans, and the Gaulish Boii (the settlement itself being Etruscan). Although the exact date of its foundation is unknown, it is known that it was already in existence in the 3rd century BC, for in 218 BC, during Hannibal&#x27;s invasion of Italy, the Boii revolted and laid siege to the city. Livy described it as a fortified citadel where Roman magistrates took shelter. The outcome of the siege is not known, but the city was most likely abandoned after Hannibal&#x27;s arrival. Mutina was refounded as a Roman colony in 183 BC, to be used as a military base by Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, causing the Ligurians to sack it in 177 BC. Nonetheless, it was rebuilt, and quickly became the most important centre in Cisalpine Gaul, both because of its strategic importance and because it was on an important crossroads between Via Aemilia and the road going to Verona.

In the 1st century BC, Mutina was besieged twice. The first siege was by Pompey in 78 BC, when Mutina was defended by Marcus Junius Brutus (a populist leader, not to be confused with his son, Caesar&#x27;s best known assassin). The city eventually surrendered out of hunger, and Brutus fled, only to be slain in Regium Lepidi. In the civil war following Caesar&#x27;s assassination, the city was besieged again, this time by Mark Antony, in 44 BC, and defended by Decimus Junius Brutus. Octavian relieved the city with the help of the Senate (see: Battle of Mutina).

Cicero called it &quot;Mutina splendidissima&quot; (&quot;most beautiful Mutina&quot;) in his &quot;Philippics&quot; (44 BC). Until the 3rd century AD, it kept its position as the most important city in the newly formed province Aemilia, but the fall of the Empire brought Mutina down with it, as it was used as a military base both against the barbarians and in the civil wars. It is said that Mutina was never sacked by Attila, for a dense fog hid it (a miracle said to be provided by Saint Geminianus, bishop and patron of Modena), but it was eventually buried by a great flood in the 7th century and abandoned.

In December 2008, Italian researchers discovered the pottery center where the oil lamps that lit the ancient Roman empire were made. Evidence of the pottery workshops emerged in Modena, during construction work to build a residential complex near the ancient walls of the city. &quot;We found a large ancient Roman dumping filled with pottery scraps. There were vases, bottles, bricks, but most of all, hundreds of oil lamps, each bearing their maker&#x27;s name&quot;, Donato Labate, the archaeologist in charge of the dig, stated.

===Middle Ages===
Its exiles founded a new city a few miles to the northwest, still represented by the village of Cittanova (literally &quot;new city&quot;). About the end of the 9th century, Modena was restored and refortified by its bishop, Ludovicus. At about this time the &quot;Song of the Watchmen of Modena&quot; was composed. Later the city was part of the possessions of the Countess Matilda of Tuscany, becoming a free comune starting from the 12th century. In the wars between Emperor Frederick II and Pope Gregory IX Modena sided with the emperor.

The Este family were identified as lords of Modena from 1288 (Obizzo d&#x27;Este). After the death of Obizzo&#x27;s successor (Azzo VIII, in 1308) the comune reasserted itself, but by 1336 the Este family was permanently in power. Under Borso d&#x27;Este, Modena was made a duchy.

===Late modern and contemporary (Renaissance)===

Enlarged and fortified by Ercole II, it was made the primary ducal residence when Ferrara, the main Este seat, fell to the Pope in 1598. Francesco I d&#x27;Este, Duke of Modena (1629–1658) built the citadel and began the palace, which was largely embellished by Francesco II. In the 18th century, Rinaldo d&#x27;Este was twice driven from his city by French invasions, and Francesco III built many of Modena&#x27;s public buildings, but the Este pictures were sold and many of them wound up in Dresden. Ercole III died in exile at Treviso, having refused Napoleonic offers of compensation when Modena was made part of the Napoleonic Cispadane Republic. His only daughter, Maria Beatrice d&#x27;Este, married Ferdinand I, Archduke of Austria-Este, son of Empress Maria Theresa of Austria; and in 1814 their eldest son, Francis IV, received back the estates of the Este. Quickly, in 1816, he dismantled the fortifications and began Modena&#x27;s years under Austrian rule.

His son Francis V was considered a just ruler, and famously tended the victims of war and cholera with his own hands. However, he too had to face yet more foreign-inspired revolutions and was temporarily expelled from Modena in the Revolutions of 1848. He was restored, amidst wide popular acclaim, by Austrian troops. Ten years later, on 20 August 1859, the revolutionaries again invaded (this time the Piedmontese), annexing Modena to the revolutionary Savoyard Kingdom of Italy.

==Main sights==
===Ducal Palace===


The Ducal Palace of Modena, initiated by Francesco I d&#x27;Este in 1634 and completed by Francis V, was the seat of the Este court from the 17th to 19th century. The palace occupies the site of the former Este Castle, once located in the periphery of the city. Although generally credited to Bartolomeo Avanzini, it has been suggested that advice and guidance in the design process had been sought from the contemporary luminaries, Cortona, Bernini, and Borromini.

The Palace currently houses the Accademia Militare di Modena, the Military Museum and a precious library.

The Palace has a Baroque façade, from which the Honour Court (where the military ceremonies are held) and the Honour Staircase can be accessed. The Central Hall has a frescoed ceiling with the 17th-century &quot;Incoronation of Bradamante&quot; by Marco Antonio Franceschini. The &quot;Salottino d&#x27;Oro&quot; (&quot;Golden Hall&quot;), covered with gilted removable panels, was used by Duke Francis III as his main cabinet of work.

===Town Hall===
Facing the Piazza Grande (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), the Town Hall of Modena was put together in the 17th and 18th centuries from several pre-existing edifices built from 1046 as municipal offices.

It is characterized by a Clock Tower (&quot;Torre dell&#x27;Orologio&quot;, late 15th century), once paired with another tower (&quot;Torre Civica&quot;) demolished after an earthquake in 1671. In the interior, noteworthy is the &quot;Sala del Fuoco&quot; (&quot;Fire Hall&quot;), with a painted frieze by Niccolò dell&#x27;Abbate (1546) portraying famous characters from Ancient Rome against a typical Emilia background. The &quot;Camerino dei Confirmati&quot; (&quot;Chamber of the Confirmed&quot;) houses one of the symbols of the city, the &quot;Secchia Rapita&quot;, a bucket kept in memory of the victorious Battle of Zappolino (1325) against Bologna. This relic inspired the poem of the same title by Alessandro Tassoni. Another relic from the Middle Ages in Modena is the &quot;Preda Ringadora&quot;, a rectangular marble stone next to the palace porch, used as a speakers&#x27; platform, and the statue called &quot;La Bonissima&quot; (&quot;The Very Good&quot;): the latter, portraying a female figure, was erected in the square in 1268 and later installed over the porch.

===The Cathedral and the Ghirlandina===
The Cathedral of Modena and the annexed campanile are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Begun under the direction of the Countess Matilda of Tuscany with its first stone laid 6 June 1099 and its crypt ready for the city&#x27;s patron, Saint Geminianus, and consecrated only six years later, the Duomo of Modena was finished in 1184. The building of a great cathedral in this flood-prone ravaged former center of Arianism was an act of urban renewal in itself, and an expression of the flood of piety that motivated the contemporary First Crusade. Unusually, the master builder&#x27;s name, Lanfranco, was celebrated in his own day: the city&#x27;s chronicler expressed the popular confidence in the master-mason from Como, Lanfranco: by God&#x27;s mercy the man was found (&quot;inventus est vir&quot;).

The sculptor Wiligelmus who directed the mason&#x27;s yard was praised in the plaque that commemorated the founding. The program of the sculpture is not lost in a welter of detail: the wild dangerous universe of the exterior is mediated by the Biblical figures of the portals leading to the Christian world of the interior. In Wiligelmus&#x27; sculpture at Modena, the human body takes on a renewed physicality it had lost in the schematic symbolic figures of previous centuries. At the east end, three apses reflect the division of the body of the cathedral into nave and wide aisles with their bold, solid masses. Modena&#x27;s Duomo inspired campaigns of cathedral and abbey building in emulation through the valley of the Po.

The Gothic campanile (1224–1319) is called &quot;Torre della Ghirlandina&quot; from the bronze garland surrounding the weathercock.

===Other churches===

* San Vincenzo: erected in 17th century over a prior 13th-century church. The original design was by Paolo Reggiano, but completed by Bernardo Castagnini, probably helped by the young Guarino Guarini. The interior contains frescoes by Sigismondo Caula portraying episodes of the &quot;Lives of Saints Vincent and Cajetan&quot;. The dome was destroyed during World War II. This church houses the funerary monuments of the Dukes of Este.
* Santa Maria della Pomposa: also known as &quot;Aedes Muratoriana&quot;, is probably the oldest religious church in town, documented as early as 1135. Little remains of the original medieval temple. Construction of the present church is mainly due to Ludovico Antonio Muratori, the parish priest (1716–1750), who rebuilt it from the ground.
* San Giovanni Decollato: church of &quot;St. John Baptist Beheaded&quot; built in the 16th century over a pre-existing temple dedicated to St Michael, and modified in 18th century.
* Sant&#x27;Agostino: 14th-century church of St Augustine, largely renovated in 1663 for the funeral of Alfonso IV d&#x27;Este. The sober original structure was embellished with 17th-century stuccoes and a panelled ceiling. The most notable artwork is the &quot;Deposition&quot; (1476) by the Modenese Antonio Begarelli, once in the church of San Giovanni Battista. Traces of a 14th-century fresco by Tommaso da Modena can still be seen.
* San Francesco: construction of the church of St Francis begun in 1224 by the Franciscans, and not finished for two centuries. The Gothic-style church houses one of Begarelli&#x27;s masterworks, a &quot;Deposition of Christ&quot; made up of thirteen statues.
* San Pietro: church erected, according to tradition, over the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. The current Renaissance-style edifice is from 1476, built next to a Benedictine abbey founded in 996 outside the city walls; the church is among the few 15th-century structures of this style Modena. The interior has a 15th-century organ and numerous terracotta works by Begarelli. The campanile was built in 1629.
* San Giorgio: church of St George, and also known as the Sanctuary of the Blessed Virgin Helper of the Modenese People. The church boasts a venerated image of the Madonna as a main altarpiece. The main altar (1666) was built with polychrome marbles by Antonio Loraghi. The layout is that of a Greek cross, and was erected in 1647.
* San Bartolomeo, Modena
* Chiesa del Voto: Votive Church erected after the cessation of the Plague of 1630.
===Synagogue===
* The Synagogue, opposite the Palazzo Comunale, was built by the in Lombardesque style and inaugurated in 1873.

===Other sights===
* Mercato Albinelli, a historical covered market founded in 1931
* Orto Botanico dell&#x27;Università di Modena e Reggio Emilia, a botanical garden
* San Cataldo Cemetery, designed by avant-gardist Italian architect Aldo Rossi (1971–1997)
* Home (museum) of Luciano Pavarotti

==Culture==

===Museums===
====Museum Palace====
The Museum Palace, on the St. Augustine square, is an example of civil architecture from the Este period, built as a Hostel for the poor, together with the nearby Hospital in the late 18th century. Today it houses the main museums of Modena:
* Estense Gallery, with works by Tintoretto, Paolo Veronese, Guido Reni, Correggio, Cosmé Tura and brothers Annibale and Agostino Carracci. The most famous works are the two portraits of Francis I d&#x27;Este, a sculpture by Gian Lorenzo Bernini and a canvas by Diego Velázquez.
* Estense Library, one of the most important libraries in Italy.
* Museum of Medieval and Modern Art.
* Municipal Museum of Risorgimento.
* Este Headstones Museum.
* Roman Lapidary Museum.
* Graziosi Gallery of Plaster Casts.
* City Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology.

The Estense Gallery and Library have reopened on 29 May 2015 after the earthquake of 2012. The Gallery has been completely restored but some pieces are still damaged and thus cannot be seen.

====Museums of the Cathedral====
Opened for the Great Jubilee in 2000, the Museum of the Cathedral houses a rich collection of artistic heritage, in particular liturgical ornaments and furnishings. Apart from the finds of the cathedral building site by Wiligelmus and Lanfranco, such as romanesque metopes and roof decorations, in the Lapidary there are also reliefs, sculptures and inscriptions of the Roman, Medieval and Renaissance era found in the cathedral area during the restoration works between the 19th and the 20th century.

====Museum Enzo Ferrari====
Inaugurated on 10 March 2012, the museum complex includes Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s birthplace and a futuristic automotive design gallery, painted in the yellow that Enzo Ferrari chose as the background for the Prancing horse on his logo. The exhibition gallery was designed by the famous architect Jan Kaplický, who suddenly died in 2009, and carried on by his associate and loyal assistant Andrea Morgante.

The interior features a multimedia display of pictures, unpublished films and precious mementoes of Enzo Ferrari&#x27;s life as a man, driver and car-maker throughout the 20th century.

The Exhibition Gallery houses a flexible mounting representing story, figures, places and races of the Modenese sport motor racing.

====Museum of Collectible Cards====
Founded in 1986 by Giuseppe Panini, who then decided to donate his collection to the city, the Museo della figurina was opened to the public on 15 December 2006. It is located inside the Santa Margherita Palace, which also houses the Delfini Library and the City Gallery.

The Museum houses several collections, including, apart from the classic stickers, cigarette cards, letter seals, matchboxes and calendars, all of which represent a very important historical document of the development of picture cards throughout the years.

===Teatro Comunale Modena===
The Teatro Comunale Modena (Community Theatre of Modena, but renamed in October 2007 as &quot;Teatro Comunale Luciano Pavarotti&quot;) is an opera house in Modena. The idea for the creation of the present theatre dates from 1838, when it became apparent that the then-existing Teatro Comunale di via Emilia (in dual private and public ownership) was no longer suitable for staging opera. However, this house had been the venue for presentations of all of the works of Donizetti, Bellini and Rossini up to this time, and a flourishing operatic culture existed in Modena.

Under the Mayor of Modena in collaboration with the Conservatorio dell&#x27;Illustrissima Comunità (Conservatory of the Most Illustrious Community), architect Francesco Vandelli was engaged to design the Teatro dell&#x27;Illustrissima Comunità, as the theatre was first called, &quot;for the dignity of the city and for the transmission of the scenic arts&quot;. Paid for in the manner typical of the time – from the sale of boxes – in addition to a significant gift from Duke Friedrich IV, Vandelli created a design for the new theatre combining ideas from those in Piacenza, Mantua, and Milan, and it opened on 2 October 1841 with a performance of Gandini&#x27;s &quot;Adelaide di Borgogna al Castello di Canossa&quot;, an opera specially commissioned for the occasion.

===Cuisine===

Modena has a rich and diversified cuisine, often including meats, hams and salamis. One of the most famous &quot;modenese&quot; dishes is &quot;zampone&quot; (the fatter and heartier version) or &quot;cotechino Modena&quot; (&quot;cotechino&quot; is leaner and less fat than &quot;zampone&quot;). &quot;Cotechino&quot; dates back to around 1511 to Mirandola, where, whilst besieged, the people had to find a way to preserve meat and use the less tender cuts, so made the &quot;cotechino&quot;. By the 18th century it had become more popular than the yellowish sausage had been around at the time, and in the 19th century was in mass production in and around the area.

Modena&#x27;s contribution to the Italian pasta culture are &quot;tortellini&quot; and &quot;tortelloni&quot;, which are squares of pasta shaped in the form of a ring and stuffed with meat or cheese.

&quot;Cappello del prete&quot; is also a popular meal, which is a very fatty pig&#x27;s trotter. Other dishes include &quot;torta Barozzi&quot; or &quot;torta nera&quot;, which is a black tart (a dessert made with a coffee/cocoa and almond filling encased in a fine pastry dough), &quot;ciccioli&quot;, made by slowly cooking, compressing, drying, and aging fatty, leftover pieces of pork, and &quot;pesto modenese&quot;, which is cured pork back fat pounded with garlic, rosemary and Parmesan, used to fill borlenghi and crescentine.

Balsamic vinegar of Modena became a protected geographical indication under EU law in 2000. The Balsamic Vinegar is a condiment for salad, cheese, strawberries and many other dishes. The practice of cooking the must of grapes can be traced back to the ancient Romans: the so-called sapum was used both as a medicinal product and in the kitchen as a sweetener and condiment. The long history of the Balsamic Vinegar came to us through centuries and now is most consumed abroad than in Italy.

<doc id="62424" wikidata="Q2087302" url="?curid=62424" title="List of pharmaceutical companies">
<text>This listing is limited to those independent companies and subsidiaries notable enough to have their own articles in Wikipedia. Both going concerns and defunct firms are included, as well as firms that were part of the pharmaceutical industry at some time in their existence, provided they were engaged in the production of human (as opposed to veterinary) therapeutics. Included here are companies engaged not only in pharmaceutical development, but also supply chain management and device development, including compounding pharmacies.

Firms with no marketed products but which are working on pharmaceutical development as well as mature firms with a post-marketed portfolios have been included here.

Types of firms not include here include

* Retail pharmacies
* Intellectual property holding firms
* Firms specialized in the collection, fractionation and distribution of human blood
* Medical device manufacturers where the device is not related to pharmaceutical administration, including diagnostics only firms
* Ayurvedic, homeopathic, traditional Chinese medicinal, herbal supplement (e.g. &quot;unani&quot; in Bangladesh and Pakistan) and firms only involved in cannibis-product manufacturers
* Contract Research, Contract Manufacturing and Contract Development and Manufacturing Organizations (CROs, CMOs and CDMOs)

Entry titles have been shortened in a number of cases, so that if the article title of a company is &quot;XYZ Pharma&quot;, for instance, the entry will appear here as &quot;XYZ&quot;.

Companies which existed as a joint venture for their entire existence are indicated by a super-script &quot;JV&quot;, as in PerseidJV.

<doc id="62426" wikidata="Q2193193" url="?curid=62426" title="Tier 1 network">
<text>A Tier 1 network is an Internet Protocol (IP) network that can reach every other network on the Internet solely via settlement-free interconnection (also known as settlement-free peering). Tier 1 networks can exchange traffic with other Tier 1 networks without paying any fees for the exchange of traffic in either direction. In contrast, some Tier 2 networks and all Tier 3 networks must pay to transmit traffic on other networks. 
There is no authority that defines tiers of networks participating in the Internet. The most common and well-accepted definition of a Tier 1 network is a network that can reach every other network on the Internet without purchasing IP transit or paying for peering. By this definition, a Tier 1 network must be a transit-free network (purchases no transit) that peers for no charge with every other Tier 1 network and can reach all major networks on the Internet. Not all transit-free networks are Tier 1 networks, as it is possible to become transit-free by paying for peering, and it is also possible to be transit-free without being able to reach all major networks on the Internet.

The most widely quoted source for identifying Tier 1 networks is published by Renesys Corporation, but the base information to prove the claim is publicly accessible from many locations, such as the RIPE RIS database, the Oregon Route Views servers, Packet Clearing House, and others.

It can be difficult to determine whether a network is paying for peering or transit, as these business agreements are rarely public information, or are covered under a non-disclosure agreement. The Internet peering community is roughly the set of peering coordinators present at the Internet exchange points on more than one continent. The subset representing Tier 1 networks is collectively understood in a loose sense, but not published as such.

Common definitions of Tier 2 and Tier 3 networks:
* Tier 2 network: A network that peers for no charge with some networks, but still purchases IP transit or pays for peering to reach at least some portion of the Internet.
* Tier 3 network: A network that solely purchases transit/peering from other networks to participate in the Internet.

==History==
The original Internet backbone was the ARPANET when it provided the routing between most participating networks. The development of the British JANET (1984) and U.S. NSFNET (1985) infrastructure programs to serve their nations&#x27; higher education communities, regardless of discipline, resulted in the NSFNet backbone by 1989. The Internet could be defined as the collection of all networks connected and able to interchange Internet Protocol datagrams with this backbone. Such was the weight of the NSFNET program and its funding ($200 million from 1986 to 1995)—and the quality of the protocols themselves—that by 1990, when the ARPANET itself was finally decommissioned, TCP/IP had supplanted or marginalized most other wide-area computer network protocols worldwide.

When the Internet was opened to the commercial markets, multiple for-profit Internet backbone and access providers emerged. The network routing architecture then became decentralized and this meant a need for exterior routing protocols: in particular, the Border Gateway Protocol emerged. New Tier 1 ISPs and their peering agreements supplanted the government-sponsored NSFNet, that program being officially terminated on April 30, 1995. The NSFnet-supplied regional networks then sought to buy national-scale Internet connectivity from these now-numerous private long-haul networks.

==Routing through peering==
A bilateral private peering agreement typically involves a direct physical link between two partners. Traffic from one network to the other is then primarily routed through that direct link.

A Tier 1 network may have various such links to other Tier 1 networks. Peering is founded on the principle of equality of traffic between the partners and as such disagreements may arise between partners in which usually one of the partners unilaterally disconnects the link in order to force the other into a payment scheme. Such disruptive de-peering has happened several times during the first decade of the 21st century. When this involves large-scale networks involving many millions of customers this may effectively partition a part of the Internet involving those carriers, especially if they decide to disallow routing through alternate routes. This is not largely a technical issue but a commercial matter in which a financial dispute is fought out using the other party&#x27;s customers as hostages to obtain a better negotiating position. In the worst case, single-homed customers of each network will not be able to reach the other network at all. The de-peering party then hopes that the other network&#x27;s customers will be hurt more by the decision than its own customers which may eventually conclude the negotiations in its favor. Lower tier ISPs and other parties not involved in the dispute may be unaffected by such a partition as there exist typically multiple routes onto the same network. The disputes referenced have also typically involved transit-free peering in which one player only exchanged data with the other that involved each other&#x27;s networks—there was no data transiting &quot;through&quot; the other&#x27;s network destined for other parts of the Internet. By the strict definition of peering and the strict definition of a Tier 1 network, a Tier 1 network only peers with other Tier 1 networks and has no transit routes going anywhere. More practically speaking, Tier 1 networks &quot;serve&quot; as transit networks for lower tier networks and only peer with other Tier 1 networks that offer the same services on an adequate scale—effectively being &quot;peers&quot; in the truest sense of the word.

More appropriately then, peering means the exchange of an equitable and fair amount of data-miles between two networks, agreements of which do not preclude any pay-for-transit contracts to exist between the very same parties. On the subject of routing, settlement-free peering involves conditions disallowing the abuse of the other&#x27;s network by sending it traffic not destined for that network (i.e. intended for transit). Transit agreements however would typically cater for just such outbound packets. Tier 1 providers are more central to the Internet backbone and would only purchase transit from other Tier 1 providers, while selling transit to providers of all tiers. Given their huge networks, Tier 1 providers often do not participate in public Internet Exchanges but rather sell transit services to such participants and engage in private peering. 

In the most logical definition, a Tier 1 provider will never pay for transit because the set of all Tier 1 providers sells transit to all of the lower tier providers everywhere, and becauseAs such, by the peering agreement, all the customers of any Tier 1 provider already have access to all the customers of all the other Tier 1 providers without the Tier 1 provider itself having to pay transit costs to the other networks. Effectively, the actual transit costs incurred by provider A on behalf of provider B are logically identical to the transit costs incurred by provider B on behalf of provider A—hence there not being any payment required.

==List of Tier 1 networks==
These networks are universally recognized as Tier 1 networks, because they can reach the entire internet (IPv4 and IPv6) via settlement-free peering. The CAIDA AS rank is a rank of importance on the internet.

While most of these Tier 1 providers offer global coverage (based on the published network map on their respective public websites), there are some which are restricted geographically. However these do offer global coverage for mobiles and IP-VPN type services which are unrelated to being a Tier 1 provider.

A 2008 report shows Internet traffic relying less on U.S. networks than previously.

==Regional Tier 1 networks==

A common point of contention regarding Tier 1 networks is the concept of a &quot;regional Tier 1&quot; network. A regional Tier 1 network is a network which is not transit-free globally, but which maintains many of the classic behaviors and motivations of a Tier 1 network within a specific region.

A typical scenario for this characteristic involves a network that was the incumbent telecommunications company in a specific country or region, usually tied to some level of government-supported monopoly. Within their specific countries or regions of origin, these networks maintain peering policies which mimic those of Tier 1 networks (such as lack of openness to new peering relationships and having existing peering with every other major network in that region). However, this network may then extend to another country, region, or continent outside of its core region of operations, where it may purchase transit or peer openly like a Tier 2 network.

A commonly cited example of these behaviors involves the incumbent carriers within Australia, who will not peer with new networks in Australia under any circumstances, but who will extend their networks to the United States and peer openly with many networks. Less extreme examples of much less restrictive peering requirements being set for regions in which a network peers, but does not sell services or have a significant market share, are relatively common among many networks, not just regional Tier 1 networks.

While the classification &quot;regional Tier 1&quot; holds some merit for understanding the peering motivations of such a network within different regions, these networks do not meet the requirements of a true global Tier 1 because they are not transit-free globally.

==Other major networks==
This is a list of networks that are often considered and close to the status of Tier 1, because they can reach the majority (50+%) of the internet via settlement-free peering with their global rings. However, routes to one or more Tier 1 are missing or paid. Therefore, they are technically Tier 2, though practically something in between.

<text>In computing, partial evaluation is a technique for several different types of program optimization by specialization. The most straightforward application is to produce new programs that run faster than the originals while being guaranteed to behave in the same way.

A computer program &quot;prog&quot; is seen as a mapping of input data into output data:

formula_1

where formula_2, the &quot;static data&quot;, is the part of the input data known at compile time.

The partial evaluator transforms formula_3 into formula_4 by precomputing all static input at compile time. formula_5 is called the &quot;residual program&quot; and should run more efficiently than the original program. The act of partial evaluation is said to &quot;residualize&quot; formula_6 to formula_5.

==Futamura projections==
A particularly interesting example of the use of partial evaluation, first described in the 1970s by Yoshihiko Futamura, is when &quot;prog&quot; is an interpreter for a programming language.

If &quot;I&quot;static is source code designed to run inside that interpreter, then partial evaluation of the interpreter with respect to this data/program produces &quot;prog&quot;*, a version of the interpreter that only runs that source code, is written in the implementation language of the interpreter, does not require the source code to be resupplied, and runs faster than the original combination of the interpreter and the source. In this case &quot;prog&quot;* is effectively a compiled version of &quot;I&quot;static.

This technique is known as the first Futamura projection, of which there are three:
# Specializing an interpreter for given source code, yielding an executable.
# Specializing the specializer for the interpreter (as applied in #1), yielding a compiler.
# Specializing the specializer for itself (as applied in #2), yielding a tool that can convert any interpreter to an equivalent compiler.

They were described by Futamura in Japanese in 1971 and in English in 1983.
